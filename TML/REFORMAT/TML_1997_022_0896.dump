It\'s funny how different people view things differently.  I\'d say that a
USL landing could only be supported _at_ B+ starports, because the
facilities to support this type of spacecraft (ie. organized traffic
control, special landing facilities, etc.) would only exist at the larger
ports.  :)

No, that\'s not it at all... you just crank the joystick/flight

Personally, I\'m less concerned about piracy and more concerned about
getting a game environment that I like. In my case, that environment
just happens to be such that ships are vulnerable to attack while
travelling to and from the jump-points...whether by pirates, privateers,
customs agents, warships or even "big hairy space monsters." Ok, the
last one was a joke. ;->

Or where you have competing governments. Let\'s take an area with 4
competing "empires", Zeristu, Argent, Mark and Mui Gwan. A Zeristu ship
(or cargo) captured by pirates might be sold in any of the other 3
empires, for example. This could be legit (ie privateers during
wartime), or semi-legit (actual pirates, but the local government simply
*overlooks* where you got the ship/parts/cargo...if it comes from
somewhere outside *its* borders). Maybe Argent looks hard at ships that
show up with damaged ships in tow, but winks at cargos without papers,
as long as the proper tarrifs and fees are paid.  Mui Gwan might be just
the opposite, they don\'t look at *ship* papers, but they want to know
where cargos came from, so our pirates might steal it in Mark or
Zeristu, but have to tranship it through Argent space to produce the
papers that Mui Gwan requires. Of course, Argent gets it\'s fees for
allowing the cargo in and their local merchants get commissions for
producing the papers, etc.  

>     (b) a very intimidating weapon to make victims surrender.< snip> especially if the >         pirates have a reputation for allowing prisoners to live.

Or ships that are relatively easy to *temporarily* disable, but hard to
destroy. If maneuver, sensor and weapon systems have to be in exposed
positions on the hull and/or power plants need large exposed radiators,
then civilian ships (without massive redundency) could be more easily,
but temporarily, disabled with surface hits. The surface damage might be
repairable in short order, but until it is fixed the ship is helpless. 

Now the options are surrender, fight off borders, or be destroyed at
short range. In enviornments where the pirates didn\'t normally kill or
enslave the surrendering crews, the option of surrender becomes a very
viable one.  

In fact, the SOP might be to dump the cargo (or part of it) for the
pirate to collect giving the merchant ship time to leave the area
without the fight. This would be sort of like paying "tribute" to pass
through the area.  Ships that refused to turn over a portion of their
cargo run the risk of a fight where they could lose the entire cargo,
their ship and/or their lives.

Sigh, I\'d hate for *every* system to be a young dusty system, but Bruce,
average passive sensors picking up ships at 10, 20, 30 million km just
isn\'t the game I want to run. I really like 3 to 6 million km much
better. I can reduce some of the signature by using non-IR producing
stutterjump for propulsion, and can lower the power requirements (hence
cutting the IR from the powerplant), but I don\'t yet know exactly how
much that\'s going to help. Cutting power requirements creates other
unbalancing effects to consider as well, sigh again.

This is probably more realistic, but does change the *feel* of the game. 

> (4) Move the 100-diameter limit. 

Sol has a diameter of about 1,300,000 km, IIRC, and 1 AU is about
150,000,000 km, so 100-d in the Sol system is about .87 AU.  I\'ve always
felt that was too close. 

I, personally, set the absolute minimum jumplimit at 100-d (not 10-d)
from *anything* and make it *very* unsafe. The safe jumplimit begins at
about 150-d, for Sol that\'s around 1.3 AU. Ships jumping in will come in
somewhere between 150 and 200 diameters from the local star and at least
that far from any orbiting body.  Of course, my ships also have a
different propulsion method so time between the jump-point and the
habitable zone is still only a day or two for slow ships. 

However, stars with much larger diameters (actually masses) than G2V\'s,
any I, II, or III for example, will have *very* distant jumplimits. For
some of them there might be habitable planets, but it will take ships
*many* days to travel from the jump-point to them.  This has the effect
of having some systems with habitable planets *so* far from the
jumplimit that they are effectively isolated from interstellar trade
even when on an active main.

An early version of the personal contagrav car, the Aeron is a reasonably
cheap means of transportation.  Short-range radar interfaces with the
prototype Roadgrid system to provid a reasonable degree of safety; however,
in crowded urban areas frequent delays result when too many vehicles overload
the collision-avoidance software.

To keep costs down, fuels cells are used instead of a fusion power plant
(Fusion Plus not being invented yet), which results in over half its internal
volume being devoted to hydrogen tanks.

Solid construction means that, with proper care, a Swallow can last for over
a century.

I encountered the following problem:

In Chapter 5.7 (Hull coatings) a TL10-11 starship gets a colour changing
hull for free. If you want to reduce the emitted signature you can buy
a "military black hull" for MCr0.01 per m2 or ultrablack for MCr0.1 per m2.
Although these seem amazingly expensive, they do have to deal with
gas giants, ocean refuelling... 
The real problem comes if you remove the colour changing coating.

This gives a discount on hull price of MCr0.01 per m2.
But the cost of the hull (per m2) depends on its streamlining, material
and thickness.

A sphere with a 191cm thick enhanced coherent superdense hull
costs 1.91m x 0.052MCr/m3 = 0.099MCr/m2 (its armour rating is
191 x 68.6 = 13,000).
 
So in other words by TL10 all practical hulls are free - you only have to
pay for the paint?

I could not find any mention of this in the errata that I found on the net.

Appologies if I missed the relevant digest.

Ken, by "standard orbit" do you mean geo-stationary (remaining above the
same spot on the ground as it orbits), or do you just mean an orbit 3 or 4
hundred km\'s up?

If it\'s just a low orbit, you should be able to keep your ship below the
horizon for about as long as you\'d like.  You could match the other ship\'s
orbit just lag behind it by how-ever many km\'s needed to keep it over the
horizon.  Something similar could be done with stationary orbits.

However, for what your players want to do, I\'d just handwave that they have
between 60 and 90 minutes, depending on whether or not the other ship
changes course.  Then I\'d roll my dice behind the screen, frown for a
moment, then smile mysteriously, look up and ask them as innocently as
possible, "So what do you do next?

We did. Phil just didn\'t like them. 

Basicly the consensus was that things like wind shear, turbulence, jet
streams and "microbursts" place stresses on a USL hull that it wasn\'t
designed to take. For example, consider what a "measly" 50-75 knot wind
can do to some pretty sturdy structures. 

Even a ship braced for *rapid* turns will be braced for "bow move
right, stern moves left (and vice versa) and have the bracings built
for forces applied by the steering jets and main drive. Wind forces
will be pushing in other directions. And while drive forces *have* to
be symettrical about the center of mass of the ship, the wind forces
((by definition of "unstreamlined!) *won\'t be*. So you\'ll get
"twisting" forces in places where the ship wasn\'t designed to have
them.

This is one of the places where the rules are *badly* broken. With a
measly 1000 watts a radio station can be heard clear around the world
(ask any ham radio operator, heck novices are only allowed *50* watts
and still manage to contact the whole world).

A *million* watt radio station is an impressive thing. Very few are
anywhere near that powerful. 

And with less than a million watts (ask one of our astronomers for the
exact figures) we were able to radar map Venus! That\'s a lot more than
30,000 km. And fighting an inverse fourth power law at that.

I rather expect that the "hailing" channel ("Unicom" is what they call
it at airports, not sure what the do at seaports) and distress channel
will be *standardized* throughout the Imperium. And any areas outside
the Imperium that span more than one system will have standards as well.

Also, it\'s likely that spacecraft will follow a current maritime
procedure, where at a certain time every hour (I *think* it\'s on the
hour) all vessels are *required* to be monitoring the distress
channel(s) in case someone needs assistance (this dates back to when
the Titanic\'s distress calls went unheard because the radio operator on
the nearest ship was off duty).

Probably all systems from TL-7(?) on up will have a channel
broadcasting graphical displays of the system, the approaches to the
planet, and possibly other "maps". They\'ll indicate positions of ships,
large bodies, stations, and "restriced areas". These will range from
"fax" type images on up to high quality realtime 3d images. But the
"fax" quality images (with updates every 15 minutes to every hour,
depending on the scale of the map) will likely be on a standard
channel, with the main "port ID" channel listing the frequencies and
formats of all the others.

Note that FAX was invented *before* the telephone. It\'s about a TL4 or
5 technology. 

The intent of such "maps" will be to let ships find out where
everything is *quickly* after entering the system, without blasting
their own radar all over the place. And it\'ll give them data that\'s a
bit more recent than what they\'d get that way (except for things
between them and the port).

This is much like many faxed weathermaps available from most airports
now.

You missed my point. The *hydrogen* from that water is *gone*. Escaped
into space over the eons. It\'s just as gone as if it\'d been hauled away
by starships (which also only take the hydrogen).

Given that we have fusion powered (and before that *fission* powered!)
ships all over the place, and det-nuke missiles available to merchants,
I figure that people *have* to be more intelligent about ecology. And
it stands to reason, as with *thousands* of planets to study, we\'ll
have a much better grasp on how ecologies really work.

Innumeracy is so common that it\'s not worth berating people about. But
it does help to check out some books on the subject. I\'ve got one in
storage (wish I could remember the title) that does a good job of
teaching you how to make your estim=mates of things more reasonable.

The supply of oil isn\'t likely to last more than a few centuries. The
water will last about a million times as long. And oil is better used
in the chemical industry instead as fuel. (BTW, a million dimes would
weigh 5000 pounds, just to give you an idea of how big a million is)

> Just because the sun won\'t go nova in a thousand lifetimes doesn\'t

The sun won\'t go nova *at all*. Novas only occur in binary star systems
where one member is a white dwarf or a neutron star, and the other one
is close enough to for gas transfer to occur.

It won\'t go supernova either. It\'s too small. We will have to worry in
a few billion years (tens of millions of lifetimes) when the sun\'s core
runs out of hydrogen and it expands into a (small) red giant.

There are plenty of better reasons for exploring space. Like getting
polluting industries off earth. And being able to do something if an
earth-crossing asteroid or comet looks like it might get too close.

> People do on occasion take the long view.

Yes, but even with the long view, there\'s no real reason to stop ocean
refueling. At least not until you\'ve been doing it for 10,000 to
100,000 years. At that point, while there\'s still no real danger, you
*can* safely say that it\'s not likely that people will start using
something else (ie antimatter, or some unimaginable technology). So
it\'d then be time to start considering what to do. And you\'d actually
have a long enough database to be able to project the effects with some
chance of success.

Ah! But the money will be going to the people doing the GG skimming,
and running the base there. They aren\'t *on* the planet, and aren\'t
*adding* money to the economy, they are taking it out! You see, the
planet would have to pay *them*. 

I can picture counter demonstrations: "Jobs on planet, not out in
space!" "Ban importing off-planet hydrogen!" 

You see, you are creating a situation akin to deciding not to produce
oil in Alaska due to environmental concerns, but depending on Arab oil
instead. Sure, that protects the environment, and creates a lot of jobs
(and profits). But it creates them *somewhere else*!

The earth\'s orbital period has been around 31 million seconds (365.2422
days) essentially forever. But the earth\'s *rotational period* (day)
used to be a *lot* shorter. The moon is slowing the earth\'s rotation.
Eventually, we\'ll have one side of the earth always facing the moon,
which will make the day a month long (the month will be longer because
slowing the earth makes the moon\'s orbit bigger).

BTW, this is why you need to distinguish between the "day" (24 hours)
and the "sol" (local solar day of a planet). That\'s why the Viking and
Pathfinder data are listed as being from "Sol xxx". The xxx is home
many *martian* days since the landing.

	This is the price reason - often cheap traders are unstreamlined
	because their sensors/turrets and so on can not stand the force
	of wind.

	typical examples of unstreamlined ship :

	- the container tender, with containers clipped under.
	  the non streamlined external grapple would\'nd hold
	  the containers in turbulences.

	  ( Aurora at example )

	- the open frame warship with more than one spinal mount.
	  the needle thin meson or ppc mounts would break when
	  when the ship enters atmos:2+ worlds.

	  ( Chrysanthemum example gracias )

	And I still thing that the Gazelle was designed as a tanker
	for Chrysanthemum like ship. A clipper has a starport, but
	whats a Chrysanthemum without a tanker, a dead fish in space.

	Of course its posible to plate as many armor on a ship as you
	like using T4 stats, hiding the mass of a ship. I had to

	also be usefull in more "exact" systems like TNE.

	I also like asteroid based defense systems (at TL12+ a deep

	say Unkaputtbar) and a suprising impact to any ship tanking
	at the wrong GG. But those beasts dont move, they dirft in
	their orbit, and its easier to find the right asteroid in
	the right orbit to build the deep mount there, than to move
	a asteroid around in the system.

	the program is still under development, it currently shows
	the behavior I intended for gushemege. While the Rure sector
	shows now a lot of virus settled systems, the wilds around
	are nearly virus free, at year 50 and a lot of systems are
	human free also, because they collapsed before virus arived.

	When I declare Diaspora&OldExpanses as unsecure between 1119
	and 1130 most systems wont have any virus problems. Outside
	Rure only 2 or 3 systems per subsector have virus population
	at 1150, while in the secure Rure Sector 2/3 of the systems
	have stable and high robotic populations at 1135.

	In terms of my collapser, the luck of those two sectors
	was not that they were selected by a hiver manipulation,
	but that were nuked before virus arived.

	The next improvement will be adding a "trade index" for avoiding
	the economic collapse of selected systems, and a "security index"
	for avoiding becoming nuked between 1120-1130. 

	BTW its not neccessary to mail hundrets of MB of historical
	database. The program is seeding the randomnumber generator
	by MD5(position+year), so the program will show the same history
	anytime run, as long as the program (the number of calls to
	the random generator), and the datafile (whether to call the
	generator) does not change.

	Anybody who\'s able to install GNU-AWK on his host will have

Even the smallest of ports and airfields have some path control - ships
and aircraft aren\'t allowed to do what they want.

This allows for aircraft that are comms-out for example to be able to
land with minimal disruption to an airfields operations - it also means
that most samll airfields do not need air traffic control.

The rules aren\'t made up (in todays world anyway) because they serve a
need - many of the needs they serve we aren\'t even aware - but most of
the horrible things that could happen are planned for and allowances
made.

In Traveller Terms this means that arrival paths from one world to the
next would definately be required.  This allows the world to manage any
disaster or special circumstance much easier.  After all if ships are
just popping up all over the place - sooner or later they somebodies
going to crash.  If they have assigned paths then chances would be
greatly reduced.

But sooner or later you have to come back.

You have to hang around somewhere to be able to develope contacts to
fence the goods - and in this case you will get caught.  Space just
isn\'t infinite - If you have a home base you will have an area of
operations so you can\'t keep going to places only once - they will catch
on and you will be caught.

Piracy may exist - but pirates won\'t.

It might be the same as the Myth of the Mafia Hitman.

There are a few more coming. Basically, I\'m wading through the Spinward

I don\'t know what I mean.  I know what geo-stationary orbit is, but I\'m
not sure if it is standard practice unstreamlined ships to hover, in
orbit, above the starport.

I\'m guessing that can get too crowded, and eventually you\'ll run out of
logical heights of orbit, so I\'m thinking that geo-stationary oribit is
not normal parking orbit for Traveller starships.

If you have a busy starport, you\'ll probably need various distances from
the surface of the planet, and various courses around the planet.

So, given that, no, I\'m not talking about geo-stationary orbits.

This makes a lot of sense.  Hmm.  I think you just helped my players. 
As long as the other ship doesn\'t break orbit and come after them,
they\'ll be able to hide from this guy as soon as he goes over the
horizon--but, they\'ll have to follow him as you suggest.

Now, what about when they go down to the city to rescue their crewmate? 
The other ship might scan if he is in on it--because he\'ll know the city
the Harrier\'s crewmember is held in.

This brings me back to my first question.  I still need to figure out
how long it takes this guy to circle the planet.  If I know that, I can
figure out the earliest possible time for his first scan--and I can
figure out how long the characters have before that ship reaches
scanning position of the city.

If I had a general rule for ship\'s orbiting planets (distance and
speed), it would be easy to figure this out.

Now for an explanation...

I\'m drawing a "grid" on the standard hex-map, using hex 0101 as the
"origin" (point "(0,0)").  The positive x-axis traces a line from hex 0101
in the "4-o\'clock" direction (from 0101 to 0201 to 0302 to 0402 to 0503,
etc.).   The positive y-axis traces a line from hex 0101 in the "6-o\'clock"
direction (from 0101 to 0102 to 0103 to 0104, etc.).  Thus, hex 0302
corresponds to "point (+2, +0)," hex 0104 corresponds to "point (+0, +3),"
and hex 0501 corresponds to "point (+4, -2)."

"Delta X" (the change in the relative x-coordinates) and "Delta Y" (the
change in the relative y-values) are used to calculate the actual distance.  

  delta-x = the x-coordinate of hex#1 minus the x-coordinate of hex#2
  delta-y = the y-coordinate of hex#1 minus the y-coordinate of hex#2

If delta-x and delta-y are *both* negative or *both* positive, then the
distance is the sum of the absolute values of delta-x and delta-y (note the
way I said this; I don\'t want the absolute value of the sums, I want the
sum of the absolute values :-).  

If one is negative and the other is positive, then the distance is *either*
the absolute value of delta-x *or* the absolute value of delta-y, whichever
is *greater*.

Interesting thought experiment. Here\'s what I came up with:

A,B,C,D defined as you have above

Let X=C-A
    Y=D-B

If |2Y|<=|X|+1 then D=|X|
               else D=|X|/2 dn + |Y|

Excelspeak: 
=IF(2*ABS(D-B)<=ABS(C-A)+1,ABS(C-A),TRUNC(ABS(C-A)/2)+ABS(D-B))

This formula gives the distance in *hexes* (counting all hexes inbetween 
source and destination), assuming standard Traveller numbering 
conventions.

so, to use your example

AB=2317 CD=2212

=IF(2*5<=1+1,1,TRUNC(1/2)+5)
=IF(10<=2,1,5)

5
(correct!)


Now, If instead one wants to find the actual *ruler* distance, (say, if 
using a space combat hex grid, and actual distance was to be used) the 
Pythagorean theorem becomes useful.

Distance = {3/4*(C-A)^2 + [D-(C MOD 2)/2 - B+(A MOD 2)/2]^2}^(1/2)

Excelspeak: =SQRT(0.75*(C-A)^2+(D-MOD(C,2)/2-B+MOD(A,2)/2)^2)

Derivation of formula left as an exercise to the reader.


Note the above formulae only require one cell. (Excel is powerful enough 
that it takes a reallllly complicated algorithm to *require* more than 
one ;-)

Except the Vargr Extents...but I agree with you generally.  I\'m thinking

Pythagoras\' Theorem won\'t work if you\'re looking to count the *number of* 
hexes between two hexes on the grid as opposed to the *distance in* hexes.

Consider the following diagram (0 is origin, numbers are number of hexes 
from origin):

   2     2     3     5
2     1     2     4     6
   1     1     3     5 
2     0     2     4     6
   1     1     3     5
2     1     2     4     6
   2     2     3     5
3     2     3     4     6
   3     3     4     5
4     3     4     5     6
   4     4     5     6
5     4     5     6     7
   5     5     6     7
6     5     6     7     8
   6     6     7     8
7     6     7     8*    9    

Now, if you took a ruler and measured on hex paper the distance from the 
hex I\'ve marked with a "*" to the origin, you would find it to be very 
nearly 7. That is because the ratio of the distance between opposing 
points of a hexagon to the opposing sides of a hexagon is nearly 8:7.

So, Pythagorean theorem only works when counting hexes, if the two points 
to be measured fall *exactly* on a line perpendicular to the hexes 
enclosing the points. Since you only jump to the *middle* of hexes, in up 
to 6 hex increments, it won\'t work when measuring distances between two 
worlds farther than 7 hexes apart.

Hmmmmm... maybe that\'s the *real* reason why jump drives are limited to 6 
hexes... the mathematical rounding errors get too large at longer 
distances! ;-P

Even if one were to measure *actual distance* instead of counting hexes, 
the formula is still incorrect for two reasons:

1. You haven\'t accounted for the difference in *horizontal* distance vs. 
*vertical* distance when measuring distance between centres of hexagons.

2. You haven\'t accounted for "slippage" of even "A" numbered hexes. 

0   0101 (A)
     |  \\
     |    \\ 
0.5  |     0201 (C)
     |    / 
     |  /
1   0102 (B)
    
     0     0.866


Distance AB = AC = BC, therefore the *horizontal* component between AC = 
sqrt(3)/2 * AB (vertical component)

Vertical component for odd column hexes is 0.5 less than the same row of 
even column hexes. The modulus function gives us the remainder, when X 
mod 2 is 0, X is even; when X mod 2 is 1, X is odd.


Pythagorean Theorem: A^2 + B^2 = C^2
Let\'s take A as being the Horizontal, and B the Vertical.

Simplifying, a correct Excel formula using your cell references would be:

Yeah! I looooove geometry...

SORRY! Look at your above diagram. Choose hex#1=0101 and hex#2=0403.

>If one is negative and the other is positive, then the distance is *either*
>the absolute value of delta-x *or* the absolute value of delta-y, whichever

delta-x = 1-4 = -3
delta-y = 1-3 = -2

Both negative. Therefore, by your algorithm, the distance between 0101 
and 0403 should be 3+2=5. Clearly, by counting intervening hexes, it 
isn\'t. The correct distance is 4.

The following is a correct algorithm, as far as I\'ve checked ;-)

If |deltax| >= |2*deltay|-1  then  D=|deltax|
                             else  D=|deltax|/2 (round down) + |deltay|

In english: If the absolute value of delta-x equals or exceeds the 
absolute value of delta-y minus 1, then the distance is equal to the 
absolute value of delta-x. Otherwise the distance is equal to half the 
absolute value of delta-x (dropping fractions) plus the absolute value of 
delta-y.

I find the mathematics version more elegant...

WEAPONS


Laid down in 1083, the March Harrier made it\'s maiden voyage in 1085. 
The ship went almost 20 years, under its first Vargr owner, with no
weapons.  

The Vargr captain always had the intention to fit the Harrier with
weapons, and he ensured that two empty turrets were installed on the
ship when she was built for this purpose.  Unfortunately, the Aramis
Trace did not turn out to be as profitable as was hoped, and the cash
was never there to load the Harrier up with some teeth.

Dry docked between 1097 and 1105, Shawn Grey, the ship\'s second owner,
installed weapons in these two turrets.  To date, these weapons have
only been fired once, as Frank Forrne blasted the ship out of the hangar
bay in the OSIRIS mining base in the Patinir asteroid belt.

Today, the Harrier mounts two TL 12 95 Mj Laser weapons in these port
and starboard turrets.

Each socket is a standard 3-ton unit, using 10 square meters of the
ship\'s hull.  Brand new, these weapons cost Cr1,400,000 each.

The turrets are Vargr style "gunner in" turrets, where a gunner actually
gets into the turret and operates the weapon manually (rather than from
a remote station deep within the ship).

The weapons can be tuned to fire once every 3.33 minutes, each shot
using 0.267 MW from the power plant every time the weapon is fired.



GAME STATS

These two laser turrets have a USD of:

Port laser turret  2-0-0-0       ROF 100
Starboard laser turret  2-0-0-0  ROF 100

This is post number 9 in getting to know your ship better.

MISCELLANEOUS SHIP ITEMS



EXTERNAL GRAPPLE

The March Harrier carries a grapple carriage for the Ship\'s Boat on the
dorsal, aft section of the hull.  This grapple will hold a ship of
maximum displacement tonnage of 20 tons.  The grapple itself has a
volume of 10 tons, and it takes up 576 square meters of the hull.  The
equipment is TL 12, and brand new, the carriage costs Cr400,000.



PURIFICATION PLANT

The Harrier has two fuel purification plants.  They are located in the
port and starboard M-Drive rooms on the cargo deck.  The machinery
connects with the fuel scoops.

Each plant has a volume of 12 tons, and they take 2.5 MW to operate. 
Brand new, the plants are Cr50,000 each.

Each plant can purify 5 tons of raw fuel per hour.



DISMOUNTABLE TANK

The Harrier has recently been equiped with a 50 dismountable fuel tank,
allowing the ship to break from the Aramis Trace using two consecutive
Jump-1 jumps.

This tank is mounted internally on the ship\'s cargo deck, dividing the
deck into two sections (fore and aft cargo bays).  Although the ship is
no longer locked to the Jump-1 Aramis Trace trade route, this comes at
the expense of a cargo bay that has been decreased in size by 50
displacement tons.

These tanks can be dismounted at anytime the owner wishes.  Brand new,
this tank set up would cost Cr50,000.



WORKSTATIONS

There are 7 dynamically-linked TL 12 workstations aboard the Harrier. 
Any function on the ship can be run from one of these stations.

Four of these seven stations are located on the bridge--one for
electronics (communications/sensors), command (also library and computer
control), pilot, and navigation.

Two of these stations are located in the weapon turrets--one for each
turret.

The last is located at the engineer\'s station in engineering.

Each station has a volume of .5 ton.  Total volume for all 7 stations is
3.5 tons.  Each of these workstations cost Cr2,000.



QUARTERS

The Harrier is equiped with 13 large staterooms, which can be used for
passengers or crew.  Each stateroom is a standard 4-ton unit which
requires .001 Mw from the ship\'s power plant.  Cost to install these
staterooms new is Cr100,000 each.



LOW BERTHS

The ship is equiped with 9 low berths, grouped together in three
seperate units.  The units are TL 12.  Each has a volume of 3 tons, and
power required to each 3-man unit is .003 Mw.  Cost for one of these
3-man low berths is Cr150,000.



CREW REQUIREMENTS

Crew requirments for the March Harrier is as follows:

1 Pilot
1 Navigator
1 Captain
1 Steward
1 Medic
2 Gunners
1 Electronics Tech

The ship can be run with a minimum crew.  Minimum crew for the March
Harrier is as follows:

1 Pilot
1 Navigator
1 Engineer
1 Electronics Tech 

The electronics tech is used as a catch all for the various positions
not requireing full time attention--communications, sensors, gravitics,
computer operator/tech, watch relief, ship\'s boat pilot, ATV driver,
air/raft pilot, etc.).  In a pinch, the Harrier can be run by just three
people (pilot, navigator, engineer), if between the three these other
three the duties covered by the electronics tech are covered.

It is not suggested that the Harrier be operated at any lengthy period
of time with fewer than 4 crew members.

Re:  Piracy

Even given ample resources to deal with pirates, lets not forget the
effects of good old corruption.  There\'s a lot of money in hot starships,
and I\'d be surprised if some of it dsidn\'t stick in the hands of officials.

Why? It costs nothing and it has at least one benefit: It deters piracy.
I don\'t see why anyone would _not_ assign flight paths.

David, if you put down at a starport, the port has enough data to identify
you, unless you used cleverly forged papers. If you used forged papers you
leave another kind of trail. And if you sit around on the tarmac and
suddenly decide to leave just after another ship has left, you arouse the
suspicions of any patrol vessel stationed at the world. You also arouse
the suspicions of your intended prey, losing any chance of surprising him.

To prevent the merchant from jumping from within the 100 diameter limit,
which may not be something a merchant cares to do if he can avoid it, but
is still preferrable to losing the whole ship (If a pirate catches a ship
with its tanks full, there is no reason why he shouldn\'t take the ship too).

And with all the disadvantages I mentioned above.

Or, far more propably, decides to jump away from inside the 100 diameter
limit.

No, but all the hard science fiction I\'ve read says that manipulating heavy
objects in space is a difficult, dangerous, time-consuming job. I admit
that Asimov, Cherryh, Heinlein and all the rest may be wrong and you right,
but I know who I would belive if I had to make a bet.

The thing is, you haven\'t explained how the pirate intercepted the merchant
in the first place. If he wants to make sure that his prey can\'t escape by
a premature jump then he has to go after incoming ships. That means he has
to lurk either near the jump limit or down on the planet, intercept the
merchant, disable him, and match vectors with him before a patrol ship can
get close enough to hit him. (And when you do try to explain, please select
either a real merchant ship that just turns pirate occasionally or a 
dedicated pirate ship for your example. Don\'t use one type of ship when it
comes to fooling starport, patrols, and prey and another kind when it comes
to catching and fighting the prey).

No you can\'t. New York dosen\'t have enough cops to put one every 15 feet
throughout the city 24 hours a day. But the Imperium _does_ have enough
ships to put a lot in every system (And still leave every important
system defended against attacks).

That is, they have if we use the canonical rules for establishing the size
of naval budgets and the cost of maintaining ships. Just the other day I
realized (or I think I realized) why David refused to accept that this was 
the case. As far as I can make out, he assumes that no government will use
more money to defend against pirates than can be saved by suppressing them.
Consequently any money spent on a navy will be less than is needed to fulfil
all its other functions PLUS suppressing pirates completely. So propably
the Imperial navy is smaller than I claim, but if it isn\'t, then it needs
almost everything it has to keep the Zhodani, Sword Worlds, Vargr, etc. in
check. No matter how many ships it has, it needs almost all of them for
duties incompatible with piracy suppression, whether or not David can
explain just what.

In other words, David uses the assumption that piracy is possible to prove
that piracy is possible.

No wonder I can\'t convince him, nor he me. We\'re discussing two different
things!

So I will rephrase my original claim: If naval budgets are fixed according
to either TCS or _Striker_ or anything close to those two systems, and if
considerably less than 1% of the budget (I won\'t commit myself to the 0.1%
figure I started out with, but I think I can make 0.2% stick) is used for
combined pickets/patrol ships, then piracy as a career is impossible and
as a part-time occupation almost impossible in any area of a Traveller
universe that has at least one high-population planet per 20 systems.

You can\'t get rid of it if there are more places to commit crimes than you
can realistically have sufficient guards stationed to prevent it. No
argument there. My argument is that thanks to the way jump drives work,
the number of places that you need to guard is proportionally far less
than any historical parralel that I can think of, and the assets that
canon indicates would be available more than sufficient to cover them. If
you want to argue that realistically those assets wouldn\'t be available
if that meant that they would be sufficient to do the job, then that\'s
fine; it just means that the part of canon that you think is least likely
is another than the part that I think least likely. 
 
And that means that I owe David an apology. You were right. We were
disagreeing about basic assumptions, not about interpretation. Sorry.

Douglas, if you were a pirate pursuing a merchant, would you really match
vectors with any boxes he happened to push out of his cargo hold, allowing
him to escape while you checked whether he had left you full cargo containers
or empty fold-out boxes that just looked like cargo containers (or just
plain tin foil, for that matter)?

I can appreciate (though not agree with) the position that the Imperium
wouldn\'t buy enough ships to patrol all its systems full-time. I still
vehemently disagree with the position that any government would fail to
use the ships if the had them anyway.

Ok, but there are some problems with this:

First, according to FF&S (I, not II) fuel scoops take up only surface 
area, not volume. It seems reasonable to assume then that fuel scoops do
just that - they scoop. It\'s never been mentioned that fuel scoops
in any way purify the fuel. Now, I know this is obviously silly
as it\'s unlikely that starship fusion plants can run on either water
(for oceans) or ammonia, et al (for gas giants), but that\'s canon for 
you.

Second, let\'s say that fuel scoops do crack the hydrogen out and you\'re
left, after scooping, with tanks of pure LHyd. Again, the purification 
plant can work after scooping is done to refine the fuel in situ.
Of what use is separating the isotopes? I mean, if you want pure
H2 or H3 (or whatever it\'s called) sure, great, but once you\'ve purified
it, you still have a bunch of normal H1 which you have to do something
with. I suppose this could be explained using the "jump bubble"
theory then you could use the H2/H3 in the fusion plant and the H1
would go into the bubble, but if you don\'t subscribe to "jump bubble"
theory then this doesn\'t do you much good.

Finally, even if your ship lacks scoops and a purification plant,
as long as you get a hose with the right coupling you should be able
to pump water straight into the fuel tank and be on your merry way.
Any ship can buy unrefined fuel and use it even on low-tech
worlds with type C (or D) starports. Is this supposed to be LHyd?

The Traveller background has never really been super clear on
what exactly "unrefined fuel" is. It seems most Trav fusion plant
can run on just about anything as long as it\'s got some hydrogen in
it somewhere.

Also, back to my point way, way back that most worlds would 
prohibit ocean refueling - I imagine that most worlds would prohibit
a starship landing anywhere but the starport, for the purposes of 
cargo control and immigration. So ocean landings are right out,
biological dangers or no.

It can if 99.9999% of the star system isn\'t used.

Of course, each outpost on each different planet has to have its own
patrol ship. All we are saying is that one patrol ship can make life
almost impossible for any pirate. By orbiting the planet at, say, 10
diameters it can intercept any ship that makes trouble within the 100
diameters limit in a few hours (I don\'t know enough about celestial
mechanics to give an accurate figure). It may be that you\'d want a
few  patrol ships stationed at specific spots at the 100 diameter limit
to make things doubly difficult for pirates; personally I\'d assign an
8 or 10 ship squadron to each system; that would allow for rotation
and maintenance and still leave you half a dozen ships on duty at all
times.

If traffic is very light you only need two ships at the most; you have
one ship stationed at the jump limit and one at the planet. Whenever a
merchant ship arrive or leave, you escort it all the way.

There are two places to curb pirates: Where they catch their prey and
where they fence their loot. I\'m not about to claim that you couldn\'t find
some place to dispose of the loot, human nature being what it is. What I do
claim is that if you can prevent the pirate from catching anyone in the
first place, then the presence or absence of a market for the loot is
irrelevant. And even on the frontier you can prevent pirates from
capturing anything.

On behalf of RGNA, I would like to thank Idiot/Savant for his kind
words about the Scenic View CDV.  While we agree that the Scenic View
does carry a considerable price premium, it is the opinion of the
design team here that the increase in survivability far outweighs the
increase in cost.  Our philosophy says that the main economy in 
buying large numbers of inferior ships is that when you\'ve lost, you 
may have some left to collect the wreckage.

To be honest, when I read the comments on the Unicorn & then the

If I might suggest...

You don\'t set your corsair on the tarmac, that would not be intelligent.
You use a Ship\'s Boat.  A nice, innocous 30 ton craft that is capable of
*6 G*.  This way, even assuming that you don\'t use a LasComm, you can get
out to where the Corsair is (lurking on a moon, or hiding in the asteroid
belt) with plenty of time to pass course information.  The 6G advantage
should give the Corsair a reasonable opportunity to jump ahead of the
victim.  (This is assuming the pirate does not have adequate stealthing
and wants to take the target in the destination, rather than the origin, 
system.)

If you are smart, you make an offer to \'stand and deliver\'.  Open cargo
bay and dump cargo, don\'t radio for help, after dumping cargo, jump.  If
all of the above is true, I don\'t come within, say, 10 miles of your ship,
and I don\'t slam a volley into your hull.  The first indication I get that
you are not working within these guidelines, bang.

The open cargo doors are going to disrupt the jump field *slightly*! :)
No yell for help, no SDB charging to the rescue.  And damage, even hull
damage, is _very_ expensive to the merchant.  No High Passenger will risk
their skins on a ship that is slagged, so it needs to be fixed.  That
means time.  The cargo can be replaced after a few consecutive jumps, even
if the skipper has to pay out of pocket, the time/money lost to repairs is
more difficult to make up.

What is wrong with collapsible tanks?  Do you haul in every trader who

True, but they did not postulate a system using exoskeletons either.  And
this is a developing technology *now*.  And it is not to difficult to
believe that a successful pirate crew will have powered armor that can be
used to ease this process.

The best way to resolve this, IMHO, is to just slightly modify the USL
configuration to one that is not intended to land on a planet.  No landing
[claw/wheels/skids/etc], frame only braced for acceleration stresses,
sensor/equimpent antenna stuck all over.

Actually, I am just giving a possible way for pirate to make money without
taking ships.  A way for merchants to survive the encounter.  Now that you
have pointed out a possible problem, I would modify the tactic.  The
merchant isn\'t allowed to power up the j-drive until a box or two has been
checked.

So far as matching vectors, I don\'t see the problem.  It is just as easy
to match vectors with cargo as it is to match with a ship.

My actual prey were the Type S ships.  I would cut \'em apart and sell the
components.

The only reason that the U.S. wasn\'t pounded into oblivion during that war
is that the British had a little fellow named Napoleon to worry about.  We
were a sideshow.  "Win" or "Lose" are unhelpful labels.  They didn\'t defeat
us, but we didn\'t drive them off, either.  They left because there were
bigger fish to fry.  From the American point of view, survival equalled
victory, and so it was a victory.  From the Anglo-Canadian point of view,
the rebels had been trounced and taught who still ruled the seas.

Who won?  The only clear victory is for Canadian bar-goers, who now have
something to respond when Americans visit Canada and call it the 51st state.

I am not that up on orbital mechanics, but...

Assuming I can burn all the reaction mass (or lack thereof) I want, I could
put my ship into a geosynchronous orbit at any altitude I want.  This is
not to say there isn\'t a specific altitude (or range of altitudes) in mind
when "geosynchronous orbit" is bandied about.  That altitude is the one
used by various satellites/vehicles to \'stay in one place\' relative to a
point on the surface *without using any reaction mass* (or at least using
very little).

If I was on board the March Harrier, on the other hand, or a ship assigned
to watch a certain patch of land, I could use my (reactionless) thrusters
to maintain a geosynch orbit at any altitude I want.

I think you\'re players are toast.

By the way, a ship in \'forced\' geosynch would be terribly obvious.

I would guess that a \'standard\' parking orbit would either (1) try to keep
the parked vessel fairly (100s of Km) close to the orbital starport\'s path
for ease of transfer or (2) would assign fairly fast, low orbits (60 to 90
minutes is good) so that crews would not have to wait for days to be in the
right place to deorbit with a minimum of fuss to any given point on the
planet.

	The Darkstar is just under the 15.5 tonnes/ton rule.  It actually
relies on an internal layer of conventional armor for most of its
protection since the asteroid material is too bulky and massive for
an equivalent armor value.

	Despite being the designer of the Darkstar, I agree with all your
points.  The Darkstar is underarmored and unstreamlined, which are real
liabilities.  Its ability to pretend to be an asteroid is pretty cool,
especially given the "scarecrow" effect of putting similar sized asteroids
in various places, but there are times when hiding in the GG would be
really desirable.  I wanted to put more armor on the ship, but its
asteroid hull was so massive that I couldn\'t afford the additional mass of
lots of armor.  
	That said, the Darkstar does have two sandcasters and two
PD lasers for defense, and on offense the Toroidal PAW is unmatched by
other entrants.  Since I use Brilliant Lances combat rules, the
effectiveness of the T-PAW is increased even further since BL has
non-ablative armor and a weapon that powerful can do criticals on ships
many times its size.  
	I agree with you that the ideal SDB should be heavily armored and
streamlined.  The Darkstar has a role to play but I would also want a good
complement of more conventional ships to supplement it. 
	I was actually surprised that the Darkstar won, especially so 
strongly.  I designed it as a kind of "gimmick" ship to advertise what 
you could do with FFS2.  It has an asteroid hull, component armor, new 
sensors, new stealthing & masking, endurance life support, long-term 
rations and food storage, a gym, and a T-PAW -- all things you need FFS2 
to build.  I hope that I succeeded in interesting more people in buying 
and learning FFS2 for ship design since that was my primary goal in 
entering the contest.

    'body' => 'An additional issue for moving unstreamlined ships through the air is
stability. A streamlined ship is basically stable moving through the air
at moderate-to-high speeds - deviations from its course will tend to push
it back on course. 

An unstreamlined ship is unstable. Imagine a big cube moving through the
air on a line perpindicular to one side; if the ship deviates slightly from
that line, the apparent wind will tend to make it deviate more (since the
orientation with least air resistance is "corner first", and things generally
want to travel in the orientation with least air resistance.) Even 
rectangular ships will suffer somewhat from this problem. (Philip\'s favourite
analogy - early cars - don\'t suffer from this since their friction is 
dominted by the wheels, which provide considerable resistance to sideways 
motion.) 

Obviously this instability can be countered by the pilot with the engines,
but that\'s going to be hard, especially in a low-automation universe like
traveller. Landing a USL ship is probably at least a Formidable task,
and would require speeds below 50 km/h, I would think. Rounding the corners
off would help...but that makes the ship streamlined.

In addition, as Marc says (was he speaking Ex Cathedra?) USL ships won\'t have
their sensors, antennae, and weapons mounted flush/retractable. For sensors,
for example, this probably means they can\'t be used while in the atmosphere.

Oops. I underestimated how much armour costs when I put in the discount for
bare metal hulls...I guess it should be reduced to Cr 50 per m2.

Note that military black and ultrablack aren\'t paint, but enhanced chameleon
coatings - and that they\'re pretty amazingly black. A normal chameleon
hull set black has a reflectivity of only 0.01; military black is 0.001 and
ultrablack is 0.0001. It has to be that black all the way from the UV to the
near-IR. This is extremely hard to do.

In that case, it\'s probably in a 120-minute or so orbit. So it\'ll tend to 
be out of sight for an hour at most. 

If I were your players, I would get out of sensor range, circle around, and
line up for an approach at about 50 km/s (3 BL hexes per turn.) Shut down
everything and coast (making the ship hard to detect in IR.) Use agressive
masking against the orbiting ship. If you time it right, the last part of
your approach will be in the planet\'s shadow (reducing visible signature),
and you\'ll be about 300,000km away at closest when the hostile goes behind
the horizon for the last time. That leaves enough time for even a 1-G ship
to decelerate enough to survive re-entry...

Somethign that isn\'t in the DSR (because it belongs in the combat system) is
that "surprised" ships - ships without their crew on alert status - get at
least a -1DM to all tasks, possibly -2, which makes life better for the
Harriers.

I\'m pretty sure the BL version of the Scout had a folding array, which 
was allowed to use as little surface area as you liked - mine still require
some surface area. Still, I really do need to look at that conversion
chart again; it probably rates surface area too much and cost and function
too little.

I think ROF 100 is actually 100 shots per 30 minutes = (roughly) 1 shot
per 20 seconds. 

It\'s something of a misnomer to say that they use 0.267 MW every time the
weapon is fired. What happens is that the power plant is continuously
chargin the laser\'s accumulator (which requires 4.75 MW if you want to charge
it in 20 seconds.) Every time the accumulator is full the laser can fire, 
and it then starts charging again. So the laser is continuously sucking power.

Kenneth is quite right that we need a T4 starship operator\'s manual...
For various reasons much of the "flavour" text got left out of FFS2, and
there\'s not much of it in basic T4. Maybe T4.1 will have more.

our sun has. We know how of a handful of systems with huge amounts (100 times
as much as our solar system or more - the "Vega excess" stars and Beta Pictoris)
Otherwise, we don\'t know; solar-like dust is undetectable even around the
nearest stars. In fact, a major goal for the dual-Keck interferometer is 
characterization of extrasolar dust, and even the dual-Keck will only be able
to see systems with 10x normal.

A couple of other things for variant campaigns with weaker sensors would
be to assume cryogenic sensors are impractical (reduce IR sensitivity of
passive sensors by 1-2 points) and that the phased interferometers 
I postulate for TL10+ are impossible (use TL9 stats for all higher TL.) 
You could also jack up the sensor prices still more - I tried to make good
sensors very expensive but they could be even more expensive.

A lot of assumptions.  Why are they going to be hard to alter?
You can just move radiators, reroute energy flows, etc.

A ship built on standard design is going to have radiators
in standard places.  What is more, to change a signature you don\'t
have to match a specific signature, you just need a different one.
IR identification is something that is, to a first apporoximation,
the same for each ship and each ship is going to have variations
off of the standardthat are not unique in themselves, so that you
are looking for a unique _mix_ of variation (and note, even that
idea that a standard IR signature is going to have clear, easy to
detect variations  for each ship, is an assumption) .  Then all
one has to do is change the mix of them (be removing some, adding
others) to get a new signature.

In any case, niether of us can say this for sure because neither
of us have done it.  So in the end, you can postulate either without
fear of being "wrong".  What this means is that  this is another
element that says the piracy is "possible" depending how you
choose to spin the background elements.

I checked an it is possible to identify single ships by sonar,
but it is not certain.  Conversly, other sensors (radar, ladar,
IR imaging) which are more like those used in space can\'t.

Right, that is why this is the wrong way.  Instead you just
alter the source of the signature.  Making the prop noising
can do this (since it also erases the old way it made noising)
so could retiming the engine.

Why can it be expected?  You are falling into the old trap of anything
that isn\'t expensive is expected.  The cost of maning all these
stations will have to exceed the cost of piracy is stops, which
will be especially hard since ways to work around this have already
been mentioned and even if they did work, piracy will just tend
to shift to smaller worlds in the same system or to smaller systems.

Well, the small price is debatable.  A system defense boat trying
to stop piracy is going to risk (a SDB has to match _any_ situation
it comes up against, or you are going to start taking losses and
costs are going to soar).  Many of us feel that one SDB guarding
a world is laughable, let along guarding a system.

However, this point has already been debated so that I
will note that this is one of the points that differences
hinge on.

Well, agree that this would make piracy rare.  However, as you
noted, we disagree that this is likely, or even possible, in
the Traveller world.  You aren\'t even close to this with
you sonar example, and it is not clear how well sonar
applies to traveller sensors.

Sheesh!  You\'re right!  That\'s what I get for doing that easy

I figured wrong.  It\'s 3.33 shots per minute--not one shot every 3.33
minutes.

Thanks for catching that.

Good thoughts.

Well, actually small airfields often run under visual flight
rules, and don\'t have such control.  Also such control is only
in the last few minutes.  Finally, this is also easier because
aircraft don\'t show up unannouced out of jump space is more
necessary because aircraft are operating in a more limited
volume than in space and have a harder time detecting
each other than Traveller ships do.  (of course even now
there is a move a foot to switch to systems that put a greater
emphasis on individual path selection).  I agree that space
ships will have path control in situations where traffic
densities compare to those at a busy airport and might
have it at densities that compare to a run of the mill
airport, but that will only apply right around the star
port.

Neither is our world now, but people that hijack truck have not

anywhere, you just dump the cargo through smuggling channels
and let them fence it.

I agree that pirates won\'t opperate out of bases.  They will
use the same methods that have traditionally been the pirates
modus operandus, passing on legit (or apparently legit)
business and taking targets of opportunity.

Is every planet\'s standard orbit going to be about 120-minutes or so?

This isn\'t dependent on the planet\'s size (the diameter)?

I\'d like to be able to figure this out for any planet I come to.

No. It does _not_ cost nothing.  Virtually every time I have
_ever_ heard (in Traveller, GURPS, Harn, etc.) claim that something
is "free" or "costs nothing" has been dead wrong.  There
is not such thing as a free lunch, but is seems that people
never apply this to roleplaying games.

Here we are talking about people and equipment to monitor and
people and equipment to enforce.  And, as others have commented,
it is not even clear how much this does to deter piracy.

Well, it is with the fragile, low tech craft and devices we use now.
It also be true of lifting heavy objects (like the time they
made such a spectacle out of lifting an obelisk in St. Peter\'s,
a task that would be done in 10 min now).

2914 to 3116 is three hexes

By Pythagoras, 2^2 + 2^2 = 8

root (8 + 0.5) is less than 3.

The problem comes because some hexes are on a triagular (60 degrees) distance 
rather than a square (90 degree) step, so Pythagoras breaks down.

In the void of space, free from all gravities, will a moving body truly retain its forward

decrease nonetheless?

I always thought that I would burn fuel to set speed, and then not burn any to maintain

	You might very well need that much room for the spinal mount.  A
while back I tried to do a psycho-killer mass driver for dealing with deep
meson sites.  I discovered that something that delivers 4.3 megatons worth
of energy to an approximately Earth-density planet will leave a crater
slightly over 850 meters wide.

	Too bad I have to study tonight.  I\'m seriously tempted to work up
a weapon (or rather insane array of outsize weapon bays) that\'d do enough
damage to seriously croggle a planet...

Ummm...I know this may offend the gearheads, but could we come up with

gone wrong, when the players look at me and say "how long will it take for
the ship to return overhead" (with that particular glaze that says that if
I don\'t give a confident answer, I\'ll be arguing until next week...)

Well, NYC _does_ have the resources to put a cop at every
intersection.  But the reason they don\'t is that this
would cost more than the crime it stops. It doesn\'t matter
what %age of the military budges it would take to stop
piracy (though we disagree on that too).  It matters how
the cost compares to the cost of piracy.  If 0.000001% of
the buget is more than the cost of piracy, they aren\'t
going to spend it to stop piracy.  Conversly, if piracy
was on the verge of shutting down trade, they might
be willing to devote 50%, or more, to stopping it.

Well, I _have_ explained, numerous times, how piracy suppression
is incompatible with military uses.  To win battles, you
need concentrate your forces (for example, read "The Art
of War" by Sun Tzu) but to stop piracy, you need to disperse
your forces for coverage.

As to wether they need those ships to stop the Zhodani, etc.  If
they didn\'t, why would the build them?  (And of course, the fact

piracy, then were are right back to the fact the the costs

This is ironic on multiple levels...
1) this comes after Hans I has an exchange about respecting
the views of others.  Please don\'t try and go
to a message I might never read to spin my points as circular
reasoning.

2) you keep assuming part of the background (Traffic
Control, regulated departure points, etc) to justify that
piracy doesn\'t exist.  One could indeed argue that if
anything is using assumptions to prove assumptions, this
is it.

3) I have never claimed to prove piracy is possible. I
have claimed that you haven\'t proven it impossible (I
know you chafe under this burden of proof, but you assumed
it voluntarily).  I am willing to agree that piracy
could be pretty rare depeding on what assumptions the
GM decides to go with.

Aside from the general disagreement, another problem is that you
ignore interplanetary traffic.

Exactly!

Just because it is "possible" for something to happen, doesn\'t
mean it will and, as I have endevored to point out, any analysis
of what the Imperium "could" do has to consider that those
making the decisions have a million other problems that are
all clamouring for the same resources.

	Sounds fine to me. As long as they don\'t ask what orbital altitude they\'re
at ... Unfortunately, my astro book is at work or I\'d whip up a quick Excel

	Of course, the crew of the ship you\'ve taken over probably cut gravity a

	"A few anchor points" ... per container? And are those anchor points
conveniently placed for you to cut? How big are your containers?

	... and the cargo just sits there. Now you\'ve got to apply _force_ to the
_mass_ to overcome the _inertia_ and cause it to start moving towards the
cargo hatch. You\'ve got to apply it from behind or directly in front of the
container, and it\'s got to be exactly aligned with both the Center of Mass
of the container and the hatch center, otherwise you mash one of your crew
between a box and the hull of the ship.  Next, you\'ve got to make sure your
ship\'s cargo hatch is also perfectly lined up so it actually goes in and
doesn\'t bash off your paint and antennas.

	I\'ve been trying for years to figure out how to PUSH a rope. Yes, you can
pull it to get it started. Now mass and inertia come into play--how are you
going to STOP it from moving?

	Unless, of course, he\'s concerned about the lack of sufficient jump fuel
caused by a fuel hit from the BATTLE he was just in, or the damage to the
hull grid, or any other kinds of system failures caused by a battle--not
necessarily rare at all!

	It\'s probably more right than what got printed, but in this area I\'m
befuddled. I can\'t get the answers to work out either! And I can\'t seem to
find anything indicating where either the F^&%*& table or the equation
itself came from! They\'re certainly in my copy of the final draft, but none
of my notes indicate anything... *&%#@!$(%@#&(#@&%$*(&#


	OK, I\'m feeling better now .... a quick stint playing around with Excel
reveals the table was generated using 

	Crew= RoundUp 3*log( CM * Volume / 140 )

	At this point I can\'t explain how the exact equation was generated, other
than it "felt" about right--a 1000Td ship gets by with a 3-man maneuvering
section, but it doesn\'t become astronomical at higher sizes--a 1,000,000Td
ship  only requires 15. Basically, a linear curve would have caused some
ridiculous figures (what _would_ a dreadnought do with 3,000 pilots and
astrogators????), but at the same time, it makes larger ships carry larger
crews. Not because they actually require more work. A large military ship
will carry more "spares" because it _can_ to allow for things like prize
crews, battle injuries, illness, "additional duties," shifts, etc., etc. A
50Td picket ship cannot afford to carry enough pilots for three shifts; a
larger ship can carry three shifts, and a much bigger ship can have extras ...

	Two answers

	1) Heresy: the volume and price of sensors are really down in the noise
for large ships, so it doesn\'t matter too much unless you\'re tracking cargo
space down to the 0.1m3 ... 

	2) Correctness: Bruce Macintosh, the sensor system designer for FF&S2 (but
don\'t blame him because they printed a beta version!), has continued to
expand and improve it. Get a copy of his latest version.

>3) If you stealth a hull, does the 1.1/1.25 volume/area multiplier for
>surface fixure contouring  apply PER LEVEL of stealth, or just a flat
>multiplier no matter what level of stealth?

	For EACH LEVEL!  Thus, two levels of stealth require 1.1x1.1=1.21 times
the volume, and 1.25x1.25=1.56 times the surface area. Likewise, three
levels are 1.33 (1.1x1.1x1.1) and 1.95 (1.25x1.25x1.25). Likewise armor
cost is 5x PER LEVEL ... 2 levels is x25, 3 levels is x125, etc.

	I wanted stealth to remain reasonable for most ships, but I also wanted
the option to be able to produce cramped, incredibly expensive,
superstealthed "spyships" and the like. I believe Bruce\'s latest version of
his sensor rules put TL restrictions on how much stealthing you can apply;
hopefully at mid to high TLs you can put more than one or two if you\'re
willing to pay the price.

	Chris, if you could add these to your FF&S2 Errata page ...

This is exactly what I\'m looking for too, Douglas.  That\'s why I
suggested something based on the planet\'s size, more specifically, the
planet\'s diameter--since size gives up the diameter.

Safe jump distance is the sphere made by 10 diameters of the planet.

I\'d like to come up with a standard orbit distance--like 1.5 or 2 times
the planet\'s diameter--maybe even a range, from 1.5 to 3 diameters,
depending on the starport traffic.

   More like 85 minutes divided by the sqrt of the planet density (earth
   density equals one, GG density equals 1 fifth, etc.)
   The planet size is irrelevent.

   The complete formula is:
   
   
   T = 85 minutes * sqrt((8*a^3+1)/d)
   
   where T is the orbital period
   a is the altitude in planetary diameters
   d is the density in earth densities
   
   Note that most orbits will have altitudes of `a\' close to zero,
   and most densities will be close to earth normal, so the period
   will be about 85 minutes.

NOTICE TO STARFARERS 

Fijan Naval officials reported that an unknown party has begun broadcasting
on the emergency broadcast channel at 1420.5 MHz. The channel is normally
reserved for space vessels to make emergency calls for assistances and aid.
So far the broadcasts seem to consist of single male voice singing love
ballads. Officials assure the public that the broadcasts are purely analog
and there is no danger of Virus contamination. The broadcasts do not seem be
originating from the immediate vicinity of Fija and its two moons. Until
further notice, a new emergency frequency has been established at 1110 MHz.
Fijan Defense force will monitor the situation continuously. Major Thom Ling
of Space Force said "This is serious, it jeopardizes the safety of all
spacegoing vessels, when we find the lummox responsible, he is in a heap of
trouble"

EMERGENCY BROADCAST FREQUENCY, REGINALD, VAMPIRE


Fijan authorities have determined the source of the mysterious singing heard
on the Emergency Broadcast Frequency. They have been localized to a starship
stranded 1-2 lightyears from Fijan\'s sun. The voice has identified itself as
Reginald and has professed his undying love for Venticuulor, Fija\'s primary
star. The ship is almost certainly a Vampire ship, which either misjumped or
otherwise stranded itself in deep space. Space Force is tracking the signal,
so they can better localize the signal, so that warship can be dispatched to
destroy the Vampire. It is estimated that it will take about two weeks to
triangulate the signal well enough that a ship can jump in close.

On a side note, Reginald has gathered quite an audience, many listeners have
tuned to hear his pleasant melodies. Ice miners in the ring system of
Geroas, the largest gas giant in the system are particularly devoted fans.
Jenna Dias\'tra is quoted as saying "I listen to him every night, he sings me
to sleep like an angel. In the last week or so he has started to compose his
own songs and even a bit of poetry. Most critics have attacked the lyrics
for being melodramatic and cliched. It is unknown what the news of Reginald
being a Vampire will have on his listeners.

While Space Force is about to launch a mission to destroy the Vampire ship
Reginald, his growing legions of fans are protesting his destruction. They
claim he is a threat to no one. Jenna Dias\'tra of the "Save Reggie Society"
declared that he was one of the greatest artists of all time, and he is a
treasure of the Fijan people. The fans gathered in Vlack park and staged a
peaceful rally in support of Reginald, or Reggie as his fans call him. It
ended with the crowd listening to a collection of his songs.

broadcast without video, but Gemstone has put scenes of wildlife and natural
beauty to the music. They plan on releasing 25,000 crystals. If it sells
well, more crystals are sure to follow, after all Gemstone doesn\'t have to

Professor Lucas Flint of the Auroran Institute for Technology has issued a
statement condemning the pending destruction of the Vampire ship Reginald.
Prof. Flint claims "Here is a perfect opportunity to study the psychology of
a Vampire, without endangering human life. The Vampire is trapped in deep
space and unable to infect anyone. If we study this harmless ship, we can
better learn to cope with its more lethal brethren." Prof Flint announced
that he was taking the next available ship to Fija, to plead his case to
Fijan authorities.

 Reginald is Puppeteer controlling a Subsidized Merchant operating out of
Diaspora sector.  He was never very good at being a Puppeteer, and never
managed to gain control of anything other than the merchant ship.  About
five years ago he suffered a catastrophic failure in the engine room, while
in the Orsk/Promise/Diaspora system. The accident destroyed his heplar
recombustion chamber and heavily damaged his jump drive. There was little
chance of rescue, so Reginald tried to jump to Promise.  The damaged
drive, managed to enter jump space but misjumped to the Fijan system.
 
Reginald is now stranded in deep space, 1.9 lightyears from the Fijan
Primary.  He doesn\'t have enough fuel to engage his jump drive and it 
probably wouldn\'t get him anywhere anyway.  With his Heplar destroyed, he
can\'t even move. His residual velocity is carrying him towards the
inner system, but he has calculated that it will take about 12,000 years,
he is a bit uncertain of the exact date, because of insufficient data about 
the secondary. In a few years he will know with in year or so of when he will 
arrive.  
 
With nothing to do, but wait, he waited.  With his electronic brains operating
at many million times the speed of human thought, he quickly ran out of things
to think about and grew bored.  After three years of boredom, he went insane,

average Vampire. Sometime after this he decided he was in love with
Fija\'s primary star, Vent.....  This is a much purer love than humans
or other organic lifeforms can feel.  Organics\' view of love is all
wrapped up in mating and lust, Reginald\'s love is pure and noble.  
Reginald wanted to tell his new love what he thought of her, so he
started to broadcast love songs.  At first these were just broadcasts
of songs in Reginald\'s library, but he felt those didn\'t have the personal
touch, so he started to record his own song.  Many of the tunes he
sings are classic love ballads, but he also composes his own lyrics and
tunes. He broadcasts non-stop, and often interjects his stream of 
conscious poetry.  He broadcasts on a standard radio band, and there
is no danger of infection from his broadcasts. The broadcasts take
close to two years to get to Fija (depending on where Fija is in her orbit)
 
Reginald has recently decided that the flares of Vent..... are her
arm reaching out to greet him.  He has taken this as a sign that she
returns his affection.   
 
Future Developments:
While many people on Fija regard Reginald as harmless and possibly
friendly, others such as the Templars regard him as a threat to all sentient
lifeforms. While the Fijan military has decided not to destroy Reginald,
they have not taken any steps to stop anyone else from doing so.  It
is likely that the Templars, or survivors of the vampire raid on Nike Nimbus,
Freelancers out to make a name for themselves will probably destroy 
Reginald.  He won\'t be able to put up much of a fight.  He has two
150 Mj Laser Turrets, and two Sandcasters with 2d10 cans each, but no
MFD and is unable to maneuver. He is the proverbial sitting duck.
Reginald is a standard TL-12 Subsidized Merchant as in TNE:Rulebook.
 
Possible Adventures:
When the Fijan Space Force first hears the messages from Reginald, they
will dispatch several ships to the outer system, to triangulate the
signal. The players maybe one of the ships.  Though it will be somewhat
dull, a week to jump to the outer system, a few days of listening, and
a week to jump back. Perhaps the players actually manage to locate
Reginald and make first contact.

Yes. The body will retain its velocity, ignoring miniscule effects from 
space dust, until acted upon by an outside force.

Force is mass times acceleration. Velocity doesn\'t enter into it.
Without a force, you have no acceleration. Acceleration is a change
in velocity during a time interval. Direction change is one way of
changing velocity and is therefore a type of acceleration.

So, you\'ll coast at 1000km/h, relative to some reference point, until
some force acts upon you.

  Hmm, assuming a longish range (courtesy of either traffic control
or paranoia) I\'d give it real easy DM\'s for the first attack, and
count it as only a minute or two for the firing turn equivalent.
That helps the hit and time problem; I wouldn\'t allow aiming (they
probably can\'t use firecon radar without alerting the target anyways).
With CT/HG, and a lot of Striker derivatives that could be enough to
cripple a merchantman anyways. I wouldn\'t try it against a warship.

  If CT ships have ROF 1, true. But my T4 stuff shows large numbers
for ROF, so it seems that surprise shots aside the cycle period is
a couple of minutes at best.

  From Striker, I can do a million klicks for ~60 KCr. I think
the book was a horrible waste of money, but from Starships at
TL 11+ the Advanced Civ ELX suite includes a 1000 AU (!) unit.

  Do you want to make a habit of jumping from within the 100 D limit?
We can reasonably assume that more than a few million (or thousand...)
stellar tech people on the ground will mean the presence of toys
you don\'t want to face. Otherwise this would be a smash and grab.
But yes, assuming outbound ships, well, that\'s another post, but I
do suggest it has merit for the casual pirate.

  You just traded stolen ships? On second thought, can I leave the
licensing/Big Brother thread to someone else or a later date? I\'m
also not going to touch the sig thing, although I would game it as
relatively easy to change, and very hard to observe accurately.

  A Scout? That surpasses unwise. Where are the active service
escort vessels if a campaign "to stop piracy." is invoked? The
THUDD/6 output probably has some reasonable stuff that could
cheaply beat the stuffing out of a very tough pirate. Any gravity
well with SDB\'s or space-fighters is going to be a real pain.

  Inbound you\'re travelling an hour or so into the guns of
people who already can range you. If you match trajectory
with an unpowered vessel, you\'re a sitting duck. You might
as well be 1000 km from their muzzles, not a million.

  Also, matching an inbound trajectory is difficult, unless
you know how they\'re jumping in. Matching outbound must be
a great deal easier.

Well, the odds of the powerplant being hit aren\'t that certain,
nor is it clear that a merchant that is helpless is going

Of cource they are going to be conviently placed.  They have
to be accessed _every_ time you move cargo, which happens alot
more often than getting attacked by pirates.  In any case, ir
really doesn\'t matter.   Once around the cargo will access them
all.  Or you just draw a cutting blade along the side of the
web.  It\'s just not that hard to cut something free.

Which is why you have tied a rope to it.

Well, the rope is going to pull toward the hatch.  As to hitting
the sides, there are a lot of thing you can do like simply padding
the edges.  And note, I have yet to invoke high tech or specialized
equipment.  Those are going to make it even easier.

Just Pad the back of the cargo hatch.  Or use some sort of spring, or
whatever.  Or just turn the gravity on and let it skid to a stop.
Or maybe they even do more than I do and give it more than a few
minutes of thought and come up with [gasp!] and even better answer.

We aren\'t really talking a "battle".
A pirate is not going to go after a fair fight, he is going
to hit unarmed ships (or ones that are so poorly armed that
they have no real chance of taking damage).  In any case,
if the ship has taken the kind of damage you talk about,
it will because he lost the battle, and he won\'t be loading
cargo anyway.

But there are just as many problems (probably more) for "unprotected" sensors
and other external thingies in the *supposed* "hard vacuum" of space ... at the
speeds that the typical Traveller craft get to, even the smallest micrometiorite
will do significant damage to unprotected (and delicate?) sensors. Even
something that qualifies as "dust" will cause *cumulative* damage. In the case
of military rated ships, sensors and the like will have to be protected *anyway*
for obvious combat related reasons.

At the proposed speeds *in atmosphere*, there seems to be less of a problem than
the ships would actually face in "hard vacuum".

Personally, I would suggest that the thread that several people have supported,
to the effect that there is little or no *technical* reason, but that the
reasons have to do with *safety*.

Part of this could simply be that inhabited planets often have atmospheres and
that people are (naturally) worried about USL ships losing power and doing
houise brick "flying" attempts over inhabited areas, whereas SL and AF ships
could make some sort of unpowered landings as they have controls that do not
rely on CG drives. Which means that this reason should be spelled out ... and,
since its part of a *human* system rather than a technical reason, you can\'t
effectively argue against it on the basis of logic (humans don\'t necessarily
work by logic, as I\'m sure we all know!).

>Similarly, the hull exterior is not made to withstand not only atmosphere,
>but the effects of exotic or corrosive atmosphere, and perhaps the effects of
>water and extremes of temperature.

This would gel with the safety idea ... the vessels don\'t have the controls for
unpowered flight, so they don\'t have the safety equipment needed for these
situations. They can do them, and probably do them safely 999 times out of 1000,
but, its the big disasters that happen (inevitably) on that 1000th time that
cause problems.

Perhaps its also a Vilani/Conservative thing? They insisted on the extra safety
factors that this represents? Or a Terran Airforce/Spaceforce thing? The
Spaceforce demanded that all AF and SL ships be under their control and dominate
the COACC interface while the Navy went for USL ships?

All *human* rather than *engineering* reasons -- and hence, they cannot be
argued against on the basis of "logic".

And even that if not necessarily true for military vessels -- they have to take
into account the stresses caused by missile or other weapon hits that do not
always oblige by directing the stresses directly along the axis of movement! And
not all military ships are SL or AF. There are other problems as well, but why
go into them again.

Sounds reasonable. However, it depends on how CG works. If the CG drive provides
the "drag" on an axis to the planet, then this may be good enough.

I agree that it would be non-trivial, perhaps even formidable. But even
*traveller* computers could assist a pilot in this. And as for "rounding the
corners" being equal to SL ... well, maybe, maybe not. Anyway, a *better*
solution is to assume that a AF or SL design package includes the *software*
necessary to allow control under atmospheric re-entry or takeoff conditions and
that USL vessels *don\'t* include this.

But, as I have noted, even USL ships will have to have protection from space
debris ... even hard vacuum isn\'t completely empty.

That\'s the problem with people who aren\'t really into Sci-Fi; they hang
on the coat tails of mainstream genre stuff like "star Trek", which, in
my opinion, is a wonderful series, but by far doesn\'t even come close to
summing up the whole Science Fiction genre.

I am a bureaucrat in real life. Trust me, if a 6G pinnace shows up at a

Why cant I jump while dumping what I pretend to be cargo ? Or even better,
dump a cargo of things that will go *bang* when opened. Hey, if the pirates

Sooner or later, someone is going to check serial numbers. Probably some
Vilani bureaucrat in a starport doing the final checks on the contracted
annual maintainence.

Then things start to unravel ...

For what it\'s worth, there is a strong-ish political push in Australia for
compulsory numbering of all car parts, in order to make shipping stolen car
parts interstate harder (Oz has primarily state-based police).

And, as has been noted, the 3I is a Vilani-influenced mercantile bureaucracy.

OK. Reference time ...

John Keegan, The Price of Admirality

"by June the total for 1942 exceeded 600 000 tons. This \'happy time\' ...
was the product of a variety of factors, particularily the reluctance of
American skippers sailing in coastal waters to accept convoy, the dearth of
escorts to accompany convoys in any case, the brilliant background lighting
... particularily off the Florida coast" (p277)

"By June 1942 the United States Navy, benefitting from an escort building
program ... had introduced a convoy system on the eastern seaboard, while
blackout measures also reduced the illumination of targets at night." (p278)

>Admiral King didn\'t assign a priority to stopping the uboats, apparently. 

The decisions above were more strictly political decisions than those of
Admiral King. A better argument for King not considering the u-boat war a
priority is his decision to send the new American long-range bombers to the
Pacific, rather than using them to close the Atlantic Air Gap.

>Possibly the Imperial Admirals would rather fight battle fleets than pirates?

Yes. However ...

(1) the small anti-pirates vessels will make excellent picket and
reconnisance ships. 

(2) the Imperium had very few wars in the Post-Bellum period. In this way,
anti-piracy patrols will be among the little actual action the IN sees.

We bureaucrats want to know *everything*, just in case we need to justify
things later. The facilities are going to be there for customs control and
so on, as well as planetary defense, and if they are there, they will be used.

And if piracy is pushed away from the worlds with traffic, then 

(a) pirates will find very few targets (because they are going *away* from
the trade routes), thus becoming less economic and

(b) if the fixed defenses (the SDBs) are keeping pirates away from the
mildly-populated systems, then the Navy has fewer other systems to keep an
eye on.

Lets call the "small price" one credit per citizen per system. Assume our
populous trading world has 100 million people on it, and twenty systems to
keep an eye on. Therefore each citizen is paying Cr20 a year in extra naval
taxes, and each of twenty systems gets an annual Naval Budget of MCr 100 -
enough to buy and maintain a quite reasonable force of SDBs, and a couple
of type S scout ships to provide a mail service.

When you appear in a system, Starport Control message you, asking for full
details on your ship, manifest, crew, last ten ports of call, planned next
three destinations, serial numbers on power plants, jump drive etc. (this
is actually the short version. The comprehensive Vilani version goes for
about five pages)

You can (a) refuse, (b) co-operate, (c) fib or (d) jump out again.

If you do (a), then we send out a ship to have a chat with you.

If you do (b) everything is hunky dory.

If you do (c), you better pray we dont do a spot check on you when you
reach port. Or that your fib doesnt show up a couple of months later, when
our polite enquiry about you to the starport you were in a month ago shows
up a different answer to what you told us.

If you do (d) we stick you on our "watch list", which then gets passed
around neighbouring systems ASAP. OK, we dont know exactly who you are, but
we should have some data.

Oh, and if you sell your ship, you have a requirement to pass this
information on to the new owner so he doesnt get into problems later.

	Oh yeah...

	Well, I tried.

	Anyway, how would knowing the exact distance in between two hexes be of
much use? Many journies of more than a few jumps will not take a direct
route, save for being through a dense main, and would therefore make the
direct distance meaningless. What is needed is a system where a database of
all stellar locations are known, so that a travelling distance is thus
determined.

	If I want to jump from one end of the subsector to another, I\'m not going
to take ten hexes, or five jumps in a J2 ship am I?

	Like, driving from London to Newcastle is just about 300 miles, yet if you
were to overlay 1 mile wide hexes on a map of England, the distance there
would be a little less. So when I drive, I never look for the real
distance, just the road distance. Wouldn\'t this apply to star ship jumps as
well?

	See ya...

A few seconds according to Bruce Macintosh calculations. Do not compare

Just one additional question about stealth. Doesn\'t the increase in volume
and surface area represents waste space to make the various systems
stealthy?  The alternative, which I would find excedingly cumbersom, is that
a real increase in the systems volume and surface area and would require
increases in the effected system\'s other properties, such as mass and price,
that are base on volume and/or surface area.

One could go through a list of worlds in a sector and calculate the
number of worlds within J-1 of a world, J-2 of a world, J-3 of a
world... and use this to build a topological "road-map" of the sector.

Computers are dumb. We can easily count the distance between a source
and destination hex. A computer algorithm for calculating distance is
needed for the short "hops" as well as the long. How do you determine
J-1, J-2, J-3 etc. distance without an algorithm?

"Team Jem\'Hadar"?  Have you explained that in order for your team to

Well, I suppose this all depends on how much you value human life (among
other things). How much does crime cost, anyway? ;) What level of tolerance
does a society have for it? The resource-management method of explaining
why things are done has a lot of flaws. Of course, this also applies to
Hans arguments.

For the record, everyone is throwing around assumptions here, since there
is no objective method to prove any of this (ideally, what we need to do is
set up several intersteller empires and run an experiment). Since this is a
fictional setting, *everything* is an assumption. ;)

<snicker-snack>


The burden of proof lay upon the one making the claim of possibility. To
assume otherwise is to make a logical error, IIRC, the fallacy of the
infinite negative. In essence, it is unreasonable to ask one to prove
something impossible, since to do so requires that person to do so over all
time and space. This is the same error that many creationists make against
evolutionary theory, cigarette manufacturers make against medical
researchers, etc. :/

One of the solid outcomes of the War of 1812 was that the 7th Infantry got
tagged with the dumbest nickname in military history.  The Cottonbalers.  I
kid you not.  Our distinctive insignia was a bale of cotton with crossed
muskets behind it and the motto "Volens et Potens"  (Willing and Able).

We got it during the Battle of New Orleans, when the 7th broke into
warehouses and dragged out huge bales of raw cotton to make improvised
fortifications.  The 7th does have a distingushed history, with campaign
credits from both sides of the Civil War, and is one of two units in the
Army to hold the battle streamer for Little Big Horn.

But that name.. sheeshh..

        You spelled those diseases at least as well as I would unless I looked
        them up.

        I think they\'ve pretty much covered the piracy issue, too. The Imperium
        has the resources to stop it. The question is can any competing group of
        governmental agencies (in any government) actually cooperate
sufficiently
        to do the job properly -- I very much doubt it. As you all well know --
        every man has a plan which will not work. When each group attempts to
        institute it own anti-piracy program, I believe what will be seen is
small-
        scale success and grand-scale chaos. Normal behavior for government.

Let me be a bit clearer.  For purpose of argument, I assumed that the
primary cost of Traveller cargo was the cost of the vessel.  Traveller
vessels cost roughly 15 times as much, so the cargo should cost that much
more.  Clearly, this is misleading, but it does point out just how good the
financing is. :)

I have moved to making civilian starships cost a lot less, by roughly a
factor of ten.  Essentially, by knocking that expensive ship payment way
down, it becomes a lot easier to make a reasonable profit at 300-400CR/t,
with all of the expenses that apply to RW shipping coming into play.  Right
now, the expenses are of the right order of magnitude, but they are
allocated to incorrect places.

I will be more specific about the expenses, as soon as I can find a
merchant shipping company that is willing to let me know what their
container ships cost to run.  If anyone knows one, let me know.

Let me be clear - I do not demand that Traveller match today, but I do
think that since we are using Traveller merchants and ports that look
identical, that they should be reasonably similar in the ways that matter.
For example, current Traveller cargo prices are roughly $3K/t, while today,
it is roughly $1K.  This is not terrible, and with some fiddling, we can
change that down a bit if we want it closer.

The problem is that the ships carrying the cargo are more expensive by a
factor of 15, and that has ramifications.  Further, the universe implies
that the average person might have taken a star trip once or more in their
life, but a single round trip ticket canonically costs $72K.  This kind of
puts paid to the business traveller

Dropping ship prices, and coming up with a different expense mix, makes it
much easier to truck people from star to star.  My game would run better
that way, even though this would make the default merchant bigger by a fair
amount.

Mandatory assigned flight paths?  Wow!  I\'ve thought I was being ambitious
by just having those ships that need to use the starport \'generate\'
facility, and those ships filing voluntary flight plans, available for
pirates.  All ships!?

Just how much does a filing clerk in the STC make anyway?  What level
bribery skill do you think it would take?  Do we require mandatory filing
of cargo and passenger manifests as well?  (Well...actually I do - but
it\'s a separate office!)

Survival balls work.  I agree that killing the crews and passengers is a
poor idea.  If they know they will survive the experience, they will be
less likely to be willing to \'go down with the ship\'.

Think of it in terms of a seaport.  A busy seaport.  Are you going to
closely check every cigarette boat that comes into port while the
freighters that pay the bills and deliver the cargo are waiting?  At a
large Class A,B, or even C starport, you are dealing with inter-system
traffic _and_ intra-system traffic.  A well developed system can easily
support populations in excess of the mainworld (just no single world
larger than the mainworld).  Each of these worlds will have traffic coming
and going.  Also, major industries will have industrial complexes in orbit
and beyond.  If there is a planetoid/asteroid belt, there will be miners
and inhabitants there as well.

A 30-ton standard craft, IMHO, is not going to draw that much attention.

One of the basic disagreements that has kept popping up in the course of
this thread is exactly how much traffic a starport is going to have, both
intersystem and intrasystem.  Until that is resolved, I don\'t think we are
going to get much further in the piracy thread

(sigh)  I _was_ trying to avoid the stereotypical \'bloodthirsty\' pirate.
I suppose an example or two made of merchants who pull this ploy would
need to be made.

You know, when you think about it, it really is pretty easy to kill
merchants...if you are not worried about trying to salvage the cargo
later.  Just pack it in a cargo container and contract him to ship it to
another world...

I can\'t count the number of times I\'ve seen that mantra (\'There is no such
thing as a free lunch\') applied erroneously. It is true that _someone_
always pays. But it is most emphatically not true that the person who 
enjoys the free lunch is the same one who pays for it.

Here is a case in point. If you have someone assigned to run a starport and
the starport has a sensor suite and a communicator, then assigning flight
paths dosen\'t cost anything _extra_. So for practical purposes it dosen\'t
cost anything.

Likewise, if you have the military ships anyway (not because you need them
during peacetime, but because you know you\'re going to need them in case of
war), then getting some use out of them is for all practical purposes free.
I know you think that all active Imperial ships are doing something active
to deter the Zhodani from attacking, but I can\'t for the life of me figure
out just what you think it is. The primary way a warship deters someone
else from starting a war is by existing. And if its crew have gotten a bit
of training doing piracy suppression, so much the better.

Which you certainly can\'t be sure of, especially since he will be aware of
your existence the moment you do something suspicious. Odds are that he will
be in a position to jump before you\'re even in range.

Well, I\'ve said it before, but I don\'t mind repeating it. Its not that you
can\'t easily carry extra fuel in collapsible fuel tanks. Its that if you
jump into a star system expecting to capture any prey you happen to find,
then you can\'t use your real transponder signature, which means you can\'t
do any legitimate business at the system. Registering ships that arrive
at a starport is so easy that it is another one of those things that are
for all practical purposes free. Since the speed of transmission is from
jump-4 to jump-6, while most tramp ships are jump-1 to jump-3, it will be
almost impossible to outrace information about your existence (though it
can, of course, be done in the case of really backwater systems). That 
means that a ship that appears out of nowhere is a suspicious ship and
merits above average attention. And if you use a fake ID of some ship
that does exist, you will be exposed the moment you touch down in the
starport and someone notices that your serial numbers don\'t match your
transponder ID.

Dammit, David, read what I write! NYC _don\'t_ have the resources to put
a cop at every intersection. They might be able to hire them if the cut
back on something else, but as of today they don\'t have that many cops.
But if the canonical figures are right, then the Imperium does have that
many \'cops\'. You may think they need them for something else, but at
least admit that _according to canon_, they do have them.

>But the reason they don\'t is that this would cost more than the crime it
>stops. 

I see. That is the reason, is it? They have an accountant sitting and
registering the precise economic losses due to rapes, murders, domestic
spats, and robberies, and every time the figure reaches the salary of a
cop, they hire another one?

Despite what you may think, human beings don\'t do everything the most
cost effective way (For one thing, it is often impossible to agree on
what is the most cost effective way). The reason NYC don\'t put a cop
on every street corner is economic all right, but not the way you claim.
Basically, NYC figures out how many cops they can afford and then use
them the best way the can. And according to TCS and _Striker_, the
Imperium figured that they needed a lot of \'cops\'.

Of course they are. Piracy is more than an economic problem. It\'s a direct
challenge to everything the Imperium stands for. Besides that, why do you
assume that suppressing pirates wouldn\'t be economically sound? A starship
is an expensive toy to lose, and a single Free Trader can justify the
operating cost of a rather large patrol ship. In fact, now that I think
about it, by your own logic the mere existence of all those Imperial ships
implies that it is worthwhile to keep them in operation, so evidently
suppressing piracy is economically sound.

You also need information. There isn\'t a great general, from Sun Tzu to
Clausevitz that didn\'t know the importance of information about the
enemy\'s movement. That\'s why a navy builds ships of different size. Some
are big battleships; they are concentrated. Others are small scouting
vessels; those are dispersed to collect information. Others are smallish
picket ships; they are dispersed to chase enemy scouts. Others are 
medium-sized raiders and escorts; they are respectively sent out to
disrupt enemy supply lines and to protect your own supply lines.

And the fact that the Imperial navy does build destroyers and escorts in
addition to cruisers and battleships proves that your claim that all of
a regular navy will be concentrated is wrong. Now, we don\'t know what
percentage of the Imperial navy goes to the big ships and how much is
left over for the small ones, but if it is even 1% then the Imperial
navy has more than enough ships to deal effectively with pirates. And
the main point is that they didn\'t build them to hunt pirates; they
built them to serve various vital roles in the event of war. But if
there _isn\'t_ a war, then what? Precisely. If there isn\'t a war then
using them for piracy suppresssion is for all practical purposes free.
Nay, it is better than that, because you get your crews trained for
the same money. Truly a case of a free lunch.

>As to wether they need those ships to stop the Zhodani, etc.  If they
>didn\'t, why would the build them?

I didn\'t say the ships wasn\'t necessary to keep the Zhodani in check. I
questioned the notion that they needed to do much more than exist to do 
so.

>If the answer is piracy, then were are right back to the fact the the costs
>of piracy needs to justify those ships.

Which I think I might even be able to do, but I\'m not going to bother,
because the ships _are_ built for the purpose of dealing with the
Zhodani. Most of them are, admittedly, not suitable for patrolling.
But I think you will admit that Chrysanthemums, Fer-de-Lances and
Midu Agashaams are perfectly suitable for the role; P.F.Sloans are
actually rather overkill, and even Gazelles will do admirably, though
they may need to double up.

David, you are assuming, _a priori_ that any ships built by the navy will
be needed full time by the navy, even in peacetime, and not available for
piracy suppression, because if they were available they would be superfluous
(if that\'s the word I want) to the navy\'s need and would therefore not have
been built in the first place. If that isn\'t using the assumption that
supressing pirates will always be too expensive to prove that there will
not be enough assets to suppress pirates, please explain what it is.
  
>2) you keep assuming part of the background (Traffic Control, regulated
>departure points, etc) to justify that piracy doesn\'t exist. 

Well, I\'m assuming that losing ships and cargoes to pirates is expensive,
if that\'s what you mean. Consequently I think that any little regulation
that can be implemented with little additional expense will be worthwhile.

1) Traffic control: If you have a starport with a communicator, a sensor
   suite, a computer, and a few employees (which I would say included
   anything above Class E and some of the Class Es too), then traffic
   control is, for all practical purposes free.

   If you have a navy ship stationed in the system the same applies.

2) If you put a navy ship at the 100 diameter limit and informed all
   merchants that it was there, don\'t you think that if pirates were
   really a threat then the merchants would prefer to aim for that
   point anyway? And if they didn\'t, even if that would in some way
   cost them more than they would care to spend on security, what would
   it cost the Navy or Ground Control to enforce it? They\'re not the
   losing this hypothetical money. For them, at least, its a free lunch. 

>One could indeed argue that if anything is using assumptions to prove
>assumptions, this is it.

I\'ve asked you how many ship you think would be necessary to secure a
planet against piracy. If you disagree that two ships could do it, fine!
Tell me how many you think it would take and why you think so. If it
turns out that it is few enough, I may not even need to use the traffic
control scheme.
 
>3) I have never claimed to prove piracy is possible. I have claimed that

Not at all. Given that my basic attitude to canon is that whatever
assumptions are needed to make it plausible should be accepted _as long as
they themself makes sense_, I certainly do labor under the burden of proof.

>I am willing to agree that piracy could be pretty rare depeding on what

AHA! And the assumption I base my claim on is that _if_ you go with the naval 
budget figures from TCS and _Striker_ then piracy is well nigh impossible.

Well, if you will come up with some figures for interplanetary traffic and
the naval budgets associated with them, then I will take a stab at them.
Of course, the canonical pirates are the ones that prey on Free Traders
like those PCs usually bum around in. You may be able to demonstrate
that pirating interplanetary traffic is feasible (though given the value
of even an interplanetary vessel compared to the cost of a military
vessel, I kind of doubt it), but that\'s not really the kind of pirates
we\'re talking about, is it?

That\'s your fallacy right there, Rob. You talk of a priority. What could be
more important than hunting submarines along the Texas shore during WWII? I 
bet that if you put your mind to it, you can come up with quite a few
(possibly even the ones Admiral King did). Now compare that to the priorities
of the Imperial navy in peacetime. Can you spot the difference? Bingo! The
Imperial navy isn\'t involved in a world-spanning life and death struggle.

Oh, please! Am I the only one who realize that what the US navy in WWII did

It would really help your argument if you could point out just a few of
those million other problems that the Imperial navy have in peacetime. I
don\'t need a million; a half dozen will do, provided they cost more and
are of a higher negative news value than piracy.

What\'s so innocuous about an unknown ship\'s boat that appear out of nowhere?

Here we are back to another of the pirate\'s big problems. The number of
places you can lurk in a solar system is severely limited and none of
them are close to where any sane merchant will want to venture.

>...with plenty of time to pass course information. 

According to _Imperial Encyclopedia_ it takes a 1G ship 9.5 hours to get
from the ground to the 100 diameter limit of a world of size A. It takes
2.8 hours to get to the 10 diameter limit, where, according to MT rules
(I\'m not sure how it is in other versions), it becomes less hazardous to
jump than to get shot at by pirates. Neither timespan gives the pirate
much room to maneuver, now does it?

>The 6G advantage should give the Corsair a reasonable opportunity to jump
>ahead of the victim.  

What\'s the good of jumping ahead of the merchant if the next system is
guarded by a squadron of patrol ships? (That would be a PatRon, wouldn\'t
it? ;-)

Oh, if you can persuade Marc Miller to introduce a cloaking device, then
I\'d say a pirate\'s chances would be considerably improved.

a) How do you get within shooting range of him without alerting him?
b) How do you chack that he dosen\'t use a laser to call for help?
c) How do you prevent a patrol ship from getting the picture when he
   dumps his cargo and you move towards it?
d) You\'d better be certain he isn\'t armed the way all those Free Traders
   we\'ve seen in various adventures have been, because all you\'ve done
   then is to give him time to warm up his turrets. But if he, and all
   your other prospective victims aren\'t armed, how do you prevent a
   patrol ship from getting suspicious when you turn up with a ship that
   is armed to the gills?

No, but I look with grave suspicions on every ship that can\'t make an
honest living. Using up most of your cargo space to carry fuel is a
very good way to go bankrupt unless you have a supplementary income.

Far easier, because the cargo isn\'t accelerating. That\'s rather the point.
While you are decellerating to match vectors (you were accelerating at 3G
to get within shooting range of the merchant, weren\'t you?) the merchant
is merrily accelerating for either the jump limit or the patrol vessel
that is coming towards you at full speed (or perhaps not full speed; he
may not want to risk overshooting you). No, I think you\'d have to compel
him to \'heave to\' and then board him. And if you do (assuming for purposes
of argument that you can), you may as well take the whole ship. So if he
complies it\'s not just a matter of losing a cargo, its a matter of losing
the whole ship. Which is expensive. Which makes the risk of jumping from
inside the 100 diameter limit a lot more attractive.

Now, I know that is because he feels that he has explained that a lot of

the previous times, and I really can\'t figure it out for myself. So if David

a single patrol ship of sufficient size to defeat said pirate, I\'d be most
grateful.

   It was basically a draw.  

   While the British clearly commanded the seas (individual American
ships make a good showing, but the USS Constitution was in no danger of
sailing up the Thames and bombarding London), they couldn\'t not muster
sufficent land forces do much of anything but raid the American coast. 
While the burning of Washington was somewhat demoralizing, the raid
didn\'t knock the U.S. out of the war--the fact is that Washington wasn\'t
all that important yet.  The raids that followed on Balitmore and New
Orleans had far more negative implications had they succeeded because
Baltimore and New Orleans were important seaports.

   As for the Niagara front, clearly a British victory.  However, the
British were in no danger of taking over any territory.  American
offensive efforts here failed in part because of the incompetence of New
York militia forces (for some reason some of them decided that if war
involved invading enemy territory they weren\'t interested).  Another
example of why you have at least a modest-sized standing army.

   Where the Americans had their greatest success was in the Midwest,
where American forces pushed the British out of American territory and
once and for all defeated their Native-American allies at the Battle of
the Thames in Ontario (my high school was named for the Shawnee war
chief Tecumseh--imagine figuring out some years later that your high
school was named after a traitor--of course most historians don\'t see it
that way).  After Perry\'s victory on Lake Erie, the Great Lakes were
also secured.

   Reading Ohio history, it wasn\'t a bad little war afterall actually...

   While the prospect of Wellington marching troops through the American
countryside isn\'t a pleasant one, I would argue that even he would have
found trying to subdue the "former colonies" as frustrating an
experience as Cornwallis did.  Given his experience in Spain, he would
have realized that long term British prospects weren\'t good.

   The Americans left like they had to prove a point, and to a certain
extent they were successful.  I don\'t recall any further problems in the
Midwest or elsewhere with the British stirring up Native-Americans,
something they had been doing for many years prior.

   If anything, the war actually improved American-British relations. 
Note that later border disputes were settled by diplomats, not generals.

   The Canadians had their day at Lundy\'s Lane, a battle fought on the
Canadian side of the border.  Once again, the New York militia decided
not to show up, and American forces were defeated.  Had the Americans
won that one, the history of Canada would have been considerably
different.

Since we are talking about the War of 1812, the point is moot.

   At GenCon 1996, Ken Whitman concluded a tenative agreement with ICE
for a "Silent Death Traveller" product.  I know, because he walked up to
a group of playtesters (myself included) and told them as much.

   As to where things are now with that, I have no idea, but it would

was reached.

Actually I would also assume short range, since I don\'t believe
in traffic control from that far out (and which doesn\'t appear
in the backgroud).  But that would just make it easier.  I
wouldn\'t try it against a warship that had a significant edge
in power (like a Kuninuir) but a measly system defense boat
would be doable.

The point is that would a merchant buy one that he might use
once?  It might be cheaper to get insurance.

I would attack just before you you reach the limit, then pop
out and jump.

Not if inbound trajectories are low (it there isn\'t much to
match).  Of course this gets into the question of how you
handle velocity conservation when you jump.

The Death Star was a huge lumbering beast with a 0.1G M-drive, in my 
opinion.  besides, this will let the ship have a much bigger main 
weapon ... the odd 100,000 GigaWatt beam with a ROF of (say) 1 will 
need one or two HPG\'s!

Also re Piracy - I vote for Ref\'s decision.. I roleplay primarily in
Dagudashaag (after all I\'ve completely mapped the bloody sector over the last
few years in Signal GK - my UK fanzine) and I\'ve two areas that still have
fairly heavy piracy - I base my decision on the fact that piracy is still
fairly rampant in certain parts of the world but generally focuses its
attention of going for the smaller private craft rather than the fleet ships.
I\'ve a friend who\'s boat was waylaid off-shore of  Singapore and was lucky to
survive with his skin intact.. Just 10 miles away from one of the busiest
ports in the world..

So, I think Ref\'s have the right to have piracy exist if they want it though
it will most likely target smaller ships the closer to the Imperial core you
get.

Well, no they want to know everything that the rules say they
should know.  If the Imperium decides that making sure that
every bureaucrat knows something costs too much, they will stop
requiring it.  Now this isn\'t to say that money doesn\'t get
wasted, but it doesn\'t cover everything that could be known.

Well, most worlds don\'t that much in the way of planetary defenses
(it just doesn\'t make sense to try and guard every world) and
custom controls people are going to be busy with their own
duties without having to cover additional needs for equipment
and manpower that tracking every ship will take.

Similarly on the seperate point of registration numbers, they
are not a fool proof method and in an Imperium where records
can easily lag way behind, this will be more of nightmare.

Well, in fact, such crimes have an optimal traffic that is
_not_ the max.  Muggings don\'t occur in front of Tiffany\'s
in the middle of the day in spite of the high volume of
choice targets.  It occurs on side streets where targets
of opportunity do present themselves but for which the
cost is less.

Well, in fact the point is that piracy would shift to these midly
populated systems where there are only a few ships a day (or
week) and mainting a base to check every registration
and track every ship means people spending a lot of time
sitting around.

All of which can easily be faked.  Or in fact, you can simply
be someone who does both legit trade (and has suitable
registration) and also commits crime on the side.

So you jump in.  If you spot a juicy target you just give
a fake ID and take out the merchant (after all, the odds
that you could be arriving ahead of the records are good).
If not you give your real ID.  Or maybe you just give
your real ID, take the ship, and jump out of system and
get a new ID before records catch up.  Or you use one
of the other routes that people have used for centuries.
The fact is that these scheme can be used to manage
crime but they almost never succeed in eliminating it.

OK, I derived the following expression for an orbiting object\'s period:

  P = 2 pi sqrt(r/a)

where P is the period, r the radius from the center of the planet, and a
the acceleration due to gravity at that radius.

We can assume a parking orbit is at 1.1 times the planet\'s own radius; 
this gives 640 km orbital altitude above the surface for a size-8 world,
which seems reasonable, though it turns out this analysis isn\'t very
sensitive to changes in radius between 1.0 and 1.2.  Just for comparison,
the Shuttle orbits at around 200 km.

For a world of Earthlike density, a is proportional to r...so that r/a
term is a constant -- yielding the counterintuitive result that a close
parking orbit around an Earthlike world *always* has a period of about 90
minutes, regardless of the size of the world!

Now, how\'s that for simplicity? :)

By the way, in qualitative terms, what\'s going on here is that smaller
planets have lower gravities, resulting in lower close-orbit velocities,
but they\'re also less far around -- and the two factors neatly cancel out.

First of all, SDBs or undergunned for the task.  A decent sized
armed merchant can, especially if he has a buddy and/or attacks by
suprise, take one out.   If you use them you are going to
have to start paying replacement costs which will add up in
a hurry.  In any case, if you use Hans\' (a noted supporter
of the idea that piracy can\'t exist) view that ship costs
10% of it\'s purchase price to operate/year, and assume that
we have a 5/1 ratio of front line units to support
(conservative, 10/1 is a more common number historically),
and use Kuninuir types ships, you 100 million poeple can
support 2 ships (not enough to cover their own system).
You are going to need more than one ship per world
(an hour and 1/2 is too slow a response time, you need
shifts (american warships spend 30% of their time at
sea) so I would go with 6 on patrol in 3 shifts for
a total of 18).  Then you have the fact that you are
going to have something like 5 worlds per system with
traffic and you also have to cover interplanetery traffic.

Mass and inertia are the same thing. And they are *not* the same thing
as *weight*. Cutting gravity will eliminate weight, but the mass
remains. 

To quote a "safety sign" from one of H. Beam Piper\'s stories:

	Weight is what you lift.
	Mass is what hurts when it hits you.

Right on again!  There are too many assumptions to prove that
either piracy does, or doesn\'t, exist.  Thus, it all depends
on what the GM assumes when he sets up the campaign.

And you were so close!  First of all, if ones position is
impossible to prove, that doesn\'t mean one if forced to
accept it if they can\'t prove it wrong.  The fact that
it can\'t be proved to be true means that it can only
be possible even, if the other side makes no arguements
(ie the thesis is reduced to "it is possible that piracy
is impossible").  (The fact that one has impossible burden
of proof doesn\'t mean the burden shifts to the other
side, it just means you automatically loose :-)  However,
in fact proving things impossible is not impossible.
The typical approach is to prove that one alternative
is the only possible one (which most people choose
over trying to prove infinite alternatives impossible :-)
arising out of whatever principles one is operating from
(in this case the setting).

Second, the burden of proof in any proactive postion (be it
that piracy can\'t exist or that it absolutely does exist)
is greater than it is for a lesser postion (such that either
postion hasn\'t been proven).  Because the latter only has
to show that there are flaws in one\'s postion, while the
former has to construct a postion and prove every
bit of it.  You can\'t use assumptions to support the
postion because assumptions are (by defination) not
proof.  However, using an assumption

Yes, creationists and cigarette manufacturers have an easier
time because they only seek to prove (sometimes) that
something is possible. .  That means that if they only
show a fundamental flaw in their opponents position, they
have done what they set out to do (wether they have, in a
fact, done this to one\'s satisfaction is another matter)
They do make errors, but it is not in their burden of proof
(sometime, othertime they are, in fact, trying to prove
things like evolution is wrong).

I\'m working on the custom missile design sequence, and I\'m curious - how
many G-hours of thrust SHOULD a missile have?

In SSDS, Missiles would be rated 6G12 - meaning 12 6-G "burns". How long is
a burn? I cannot build a missile that has 12 G-hours of thrust...the only
drive that will do it is HEPlaR (Thrusters have too large a minimum size,
and primitive rockets are either too fuel greedy or radioactive (fusion
rockets) ). But HEPlaR requires a standard fusion reactor, and at TL 12,
you can\'t put one of these in a missile (again, size...).

Any thoughts or comments?

For those interested, my spreasheer does the following:
  - Any hull, any size
  - Realistic thrust or idealized thrust
  - Primitive and futuristic drives
  - All electronics
  - Custom weapons - slots available for 4 laser weapons, two
    missile weapons, two particle weapons, and two meson weapons.
  - All systems pertaining to spacecraft/starships.

Once the sheet is available, I\'ll post its web location to TML.

The situation changes when the numbers get large.  If a dollar from every
car could stamp out all car theft, we all might have security systems.  A
thousand is not worth it, and a penny is a shoe-in.  Clearly, this is not a
linear relationship, rather, it is a threshold one.  If the cost goes below
the noise floor, people will pay the cost, whereas if it is large enough to
be spotted, people tend to stop, consider, and vote against it, whatever it
costs.  I submit that <1% of the Naval budget taking out all pirates is
likely below the noise floor, but that is an argument for another time.

Look at what military ships cost, with respect to the ships they protect.
A factor of two or three different, in general.  Since we want beefy
anti-piracy forces, assume the defender ships are ten times as expensive
(three times as big) as the merchant.  Given what ships cost to maintain,
this means that the potential loss of one ship a year would justify a SDB
to the insurance companies.

	Unfortunately, EAPlaC didn\'t make it into FF&S2, and that was really the
only way to have a decent-sized missile with any performance under FF&S1.
It wasn\'t deliberately left out; it was set aside to come back and look at
later, and before later came around the draft was printed ...

	If you want to get any decent transfer rate between ships, you\'re going to
have to move them fairly fast. Which means that padding the sides won\'t do
dingleberry when a multi-ton object impacts either the edges of the
victim\'s cargo hatch, the outside of your hull, or the inside of your cargo
bay. ZeroG isn\'t forgiving, and momentum is a bitch.

	If you\'re arguing a point, it\'s rather poor taste to tell the other side
in a debate they have to come up with justification for your position. If
you\'re going to try to convince somebody else of your position, you\'re
supposed to provide the justification. If you\'re not trying to either
convince somebody of your position, or explore the general subject, why
waste time even bringing it up.

	OK, so the pirate is just going to show up, and the poor merchie is going
to surrender? I think not. If piracy exists, then there won\'t be many
unarmed merchies. If you\'re arguing for the canonical pirates, in fact,
most of the pirates will _be_ merchies, so it will probably be a fair fight.

	How much damage does it take to lose just enough jump fuel that you can\'t
jump? Damage the hull grid? Take a shot through the j-drive?

I had planned to write a review of Emperor\'s Vehicles, and post to both TML
and HIWG list.  Instead, Mr. Boulton had some pointed questions that he
claimed I was ducking.  I wasn\'t, but I think you\'ll see why I was reluctant
to directly answer his questions.  Read on and you\'ll understand.

I think this will do as a review of the most excellent, and latest book
from Imperium Games.

As I pointed out, I had answered all of Andrew B.\'s questions dismissing them

use this as the _perfect_ opportunity to convince someone who disagrees with

>Okay, let\'s pick a vehicle: Grummond TC Carrier (p67).
>What TL is it (ie on which worlds can I find one)?


Not relevant, though the book does say it is Imperial Surplus Dept. as
outlined in the CSC.  Since in Milieu 0, the Imperial max tech is 12-13,
it is clearly _not_ higher.  Personally, I would say that since it is
clearly _not_ grav-propelled, it is TL 8 or less, but probably 8.

As for which world, you can probably find it anywhere an Imperial mechanized
batallion might have demobilized, any world a FreeTrader captain may have
taken it to, to sell for a profit, or any lower tech world (<TL8) where it
may have fallen into disuitude do to lack of suitable maintenance parts.

As a counterpoint, are Air/Rafts or Scout ships *only* found on worlds of
*their* TL?


>How many crew does it need?


Sorry, but that is pretty obvious looking at the picture.  A driver,
a gunner (if it is to be used), and a maintenance guy not necessarily
carried.


>How much damage do its weapons do, and what\'s their max range?


Well, since no weapon has been fired in my campaign in years, the standard
answer is, "If you are out to kill and break things, you\'re not role-playing
(in my campaign) and aren\'t interested in character development, something
which I consider *far* more important."

However, since I don\'t think you will like that one, how about, "Whatever
combat/design system you are using."

This last one really illustrates the beauty of the book, in my opinion.
The *fact* that *no* design system was included really is a testimonial
to *how* useful it is to someone that is looking hard enough to see that
it is useful.


>When I run out of fuel, how much do I need to find to 
>refill the tank?


Mostly irrelevant.  It happened *once* in my campaign, and that was due
the creature that was _inside_ the fuel tank--once the L-Hyd drained out,
the creature thawed out from engine heat.


>How many wheels does it have? 


Six, or didn\'t you actually *look* at the book?


>Now let\'s try a different vehicle: Daedalus \'Roughrider\' (p27). Again, the

The same answers as above apply here.

That depends on how you (the referee) see the universe you are running.
Were you playing in my campaign, the standard answer is: fusibles (i.e.
H20), fossil fuels, alcohol, or anything else you can probably put in
your Hum-Vee.

See pg. 110.


>Last vehicle: The gunship at the bottom of p91. This is a joke, right?


Again, as the book says, that one is classified.  That means the referee
should use *imagination*, which is what this game is about.

Didn\'t you say something awhile back about throwing away your books?
Well, that is the same idea.  Do you get pissed that there is no floor
plans of the Virgin superstore in London too?  Look, if I\'m unemployed
and can buy these books, it can\'t be that hard for someone else.

Besides, I\'ve played Traveller from the start, and refereed almost as
long.  There is _no_ supplement, sourcebook, adventure, what have you
that has ever been the _final_ word in how I run my campaign, but I
run an incredibly *detailed* universe.  My players think it is as complex
as the *real* one, and not even a 96-page book is going to provide *that*
kind of detail.

I\'m sorry, but if you are looking for *every* answer to be in *every* book
from IG, you\'re playing the wrong game.  You might as well move to Denver
and take up an apprenticeship under my wing, because that is probably the
only place you are going to get a feel and understanding for why I am
perfectly happy with _Emperor\'s Vehicles_.

Hmmm...Looking at page 112 of the Classic Traveller, Traveller Book, at
the ATV entry.  You could just as easily say the above things about CT,
but you\'re missing the *whole* point.

Broken record.  Like I said, you _define_ it to be a problem, but the
problem is _you_ don\'t know *how* to use this *PERFECTLY* good Traveller
supplement.  I would guess that you have grown too accustomed to using
T:TNE sources and have forgotten what some of us *still* know.

Please Andrew, no more brouhaha.  I refuse to believe that I am the only
referee that can handle these kinds of questions.

I say again because it bears repeating, "The best thing about this book
(_Emperor\'s Vehicles_) is its lack of a *design* system.  We need to turn
the game back to role-playing.  It is shameful that WW is the company with
the reputation of role-playing.  I haven\'t stopped doing RPG, and neither
should *any* Traveller players/referees.  Take our game back to its origins."

This may seem heretical, but just how "canonical" is piracy really? Sure, a
lot of "pirates" are mentioned in the JTAS, sourcebooks, and adventures,
but are these "pirates" lone shipowners attacking free traders? I think not.

Just what "rules" regarding piracy and economics are mutually incompatible?
I don\'t see any special rules for pirate attacks in my copies of the
Traveller book or MMT. I don\'t have TNE, and the MT setting is sufficiently
different that I don\'t think the M:0 or CT rules apply.

I posted this before, but all the "pirates" in the JTAS articles,
sourcebooks, and adventures I have from GDW, DGP, and IG are actually
terrorist or military organizations funded by hostile governments or
organizations. I could not find a single example of a lone ship making a
career of attacking trade vessels inside the Imperium.

I asked on the TML for canon examples of Bluebeard-style space
swashbucklers. One reply mentioned a TAS article about megacorporations
financing attacks on competitor\'s ships. I don\'t think this is what most
Traveller players think of when they hear of space pirates. The Vargr
corsair rampaging around the Spinward Marches after the 5FW was a renegade
member of an attacking fleet which was pursued relentlessly by the Imperial
Navy and garnered an awful lot of press coverage for something which some
would have us believe is an everyday occurance. Another poster mentioned a
TNE Pirate/Corsair career. This could easily be membership in a
terrorist/paramilitary/dirty tricks/corporate strike force and not a lone
space buccaneer. The "Pirates of the New Order" from the Rubicon Cross
adventure use industrial espionage and moles to hijack ships. DGP\'s Castran
Marauders are actually trained naval personnel flying warships built and
maintained by an enemy pocket empire, their targets just happen to be
foreign shipping.

Not one of these "canon" space pirates fly around the Imperium blasting
free traders at will. All of them have some external base or protection.
All of them have a *reason* to be attacking other ships other than just
hoping they can recoup their battle damage through plunder. IMHO, this
makes all of them much more interesting and plausible that the Star-Wars
variety of space pirate.

Now, I don\'t have all the Traveller books published, so I could easily be
ignorant of all the references to renegade starship owners plundering free
traders under the noses of Imperial authorities. However, even if I assume
every single adventure I don\'t have includes one, the actual incidence of
such pirates would be roughly the same as that of finding operational
Ancient bases, secret Zhodani plots, or lost alien starships. All this is
canon, yet we don\'t demand the rules be interpreted so that they become
commonplace.

Overall, I think that "canon" piracy is far less common and of a different
nature than what some others claim. I have a pirate gang in my campaign,
but they operate outside of Sylean-controlled space and are supported by an
enemy government.

Yeah, and I can\'t count the number of times people have tried

Well, that is progress.

OTOH, it doesn\'t explain why the Imperium would spend more
to stop piracy than the piracy costs.  Maybe one can
see how it _might_ happen, but that doesn\'t prove piracy
wouldn\'t exist.

Well, why does he have the equipment?  And who is paying to man
it 24 hours a day?  Assuming that what ever you need just happened
to be there anyway sounds like a free lunch to me?

[Note: I still agree with other posters that even if you can
track every ship, it doesn\'t stop piracy.]

[Regarding war ships being a free lunch....]

By existing in a deployment that can stop an invasion, not
existing in some impotent configuration.  Like being

You don\'t need anything like that.  Any jump 2, or greater, ship
can jump into many system with enough fuel to jump immediately.

I did read what you said.  And I didn\'t agree with it.

Well, if you take 1% of what NYC taxes for defense (average taxes
are about $4000 (actually that would be higher because of NYC higher
cost of living, but we will ignore that), and about 1/3 has typically
gone for defense)  with 18 million people that is 240 million dollars.
If cops make $30,000, then that\'s 8000 cops.  I can then claim that
this would make street crime impossible just as you claim your
calculations make piracy impossible.  (And the fact that the
income tax system is progressive, and I haven\'t included any
local or state taxes means the number could be a lot higher).

>But if the canonical figures are right, then the Imperium does have that

Well, if you use the same sort of analysis, then NYC has a cop
on every intersection.

Do they do it on a cop by cop basis?  No.  What\'s your point?

Nor do they do everything in wastefull way.  You are proposing to
prove that piracy couldn\'t exist.  Not that the Imperium might
be willing to waste money putting in ordinate resources into
stopping it.

>Of course they are. Piracy is more than an economic problem. It\'s a direct

Again, you are assuming they would see it that way.  OTOH, they also
might just see some piracy as an inevitable evil.

OTOH, the pirates might just happen realize this and only take
cargoes so the Imperium doesn\'t feel obligated to slap them down.

Which can be handled by a few unarmed scout ships covering just the
systems within jump 6 of the border, a far cry from a fleet of
patrol ships in every system.

Actually, I\'m not.  I\'m willing to postulate that in the places
where the fleet is concentrated piracy won\'t exist.  But that
is going to be a the clear minority of places (otherwise you
aren\'t concentrating forces) and will leave most places unguarded.
OTOH, postulating fleets of patrol vessels in every system is
pulling a lot of resources away.

Except you regulation occurs _every_ time and may not seem worthwhile
to a merchant that, odds are, may never see a pirate.

I really have answered this several times already.  You need maybe
12-18 ships per world and will have maybe 5 worlds per system.  I
am not going to adress replies to this because we have beaten this
death before and I simply don\'t have time to it all over again.

Ah, so finally a response that wasn\'t beyond my desire for a quick answer.

So Kenneth, in view of the above, how about the following:

For any given orbit roll 2D6. (one colored die)
If the colored die is 1-3 subtract the other die from 90.
If the colored die is 4-6 add the other die to 90.
Answer: orbit in minutes

No formula, little math, quick result.

I didn\'t really have a problem with the expensive coatings, it was the

for not having the cheap one - I seems to recall that after some "friendly"

No and yes. It really in my view depend on how many you have to work on a
starport. If you have one guy running the starport, he will not assign
flight pats even though there might be a sensors and communications there.
You need to hire on new people to do these duties, and this cost money.
For this discussion to become fruitful again we really have to define what
the ports have hired workers to do, find out how many employees the
starport then needs, and then decide if this makes the starport economicly
viable. Assigning to many duties to the starport is going to make its 
budget see som pretty red numbers.

But paying soldiers, fuel, missiles, repairs, supply lines and so on
is going to cost. It would be much cheaper for the Navy to rotate the
ships so that about half and half are at port/at sea, so to say. This
means that you save money, while still maintaining battle readinees.
A nations wartime strength is much higher than the readiness it has in
peacetime, a point no one so far has considered.

This really depend on how structured the inter-planetary travel outside
the jump level is. In a low structured system the ships coming from outer 
worlds, asteroid belts and gas giants will be likely to come in on the
planet from all sides, a ship coasting in from outer system towards the
jump limit close by where a merchant is heading out towards it is not
suspicious. Its just there on its way to the planet for some reason or
other. In high structured systemes all interplanetary travel will follow
assigned paths, but this in my view is an economical question.

How many ships do the Imperium have? Well for it to cover all worlds with
military ships as you have postulated it should have it certainly has to
have many. Now has it ever occured to you that the records of the ships
codes could be tampered with. These are records handled by hundreds of
burocrats, somewhere along the line someone can change the name, the
numbers, the mission, and this could be done on purpose for money,
beacause of blackmail or on accident. The ship-records will have errors,
just like any record on Earth today will contain if it is large enough.

Example:
   "MS Pirate" using a modified transpondered that an offical at a
   neighbouring has made an false record on for money coasts in from
   the gas giant where it has refuled. The starport checks its
   transpondersignal and according to its records it is the armed 
   merchant "MS Flower Power" carrying spice from the neighbouring 
   system. Since the planet is low tech and with not to much money to
   spare, and with extensive trading with the to outer colonies and the
   asteroid field, there are no assigned flight path towards the planets
   100 diameter limit from the outside. According to the sensorops, who is
   a underpaid local boy, that is bored out of his mind and really wanted
   to join the join the navy, the ship will reach the jump limit near the
   exitpoint of "MS Goldcarrier", but this has happend before and there
   are much traffic inside the 100-diameter limit that has to be
   monitored.

According to this senario, which I think is quite plausible in the
Imperium, I have no problem seeing the pirates ussering a distress signal
when the MS Goldcarrier is the closes ship and hijack it when it comes to
help. Or using a tightbeam transmission to the merchant that if he dosn\'t
fake a power failure so that the pirate ship can come to its aid, he\'ll be
blown to kingdom come.

But it really dosn\'t matter. If a pirate got close enough to a merchant,
and there is a cruiser, defence boat or other military ship, would it fire
if both ships has unsuspicous records as indicated over. It would need a
visual identifiactaion on who is rading who, which is really hopeless in
space.

Don\'t be silly. Every nation has a budget, as does every city. And when
the taxes fall, emergency hospital bills rise, insurancecompanies go
bankrupt and so on it knows that it has to hire more cops, but as long as
the crime and corruption doesn\'t really effect business it will nly use
what it has to spare on the budget towards crimefighting. You knew that
this was what was meant. You should really drop this kind of ridiculing of
other posters.

Your point is sound, and I see from where it comes, but as I indicated
above I think that there is no real way to stop piracy as long as there is
crime and curroption in the Imperium. What then is needed is a close
escort to each and every ship, which even by your numbers the Imperium
can\'t afford.

But whan its not war, the citizens would like the navy to save smoe money.
Soldiers expect more free time, more leaves, less danger. Supply personel
needs the time to go over depots, check inventory, redistribute material.
In peactime there is much to use money on, and using ships by the numbers
to suppress piracy might not be it. And even if it is, as I indicated by
my example there still might be pirates, they just have to use the
byrocracy of which the navy is a hostage.

But remeber that most of the ships needed to keep the Zhodani in check
need to be in the bases near Zhodani base. Requireing your ship to travel
a sector or two to get to the front lines, might loose you a couple of sub
sectors or more. This collides with the even distribution of ships that I
have seen you advocate.

But many of these ships need to stay in key system to be there when the
Zhodani strike. Even if it is in the neighbouring system it will use seven
days to get to the fight, which might be over and it jumps into a system
full of Zhodani Battle Cruiser, and boom it is dead. I think that about
95% of the ships needed for battle against the Zhodani will sit still in
systems needed to stop a Zhodani advance, beacuse of the inforamtion and
travel times of the Traveller Universe.

But how can they be superfluous when the Zhodani is always a treath. The
Navy needs its ships to be massed together in large fleets near Zhodani
space raedy to jump into system reported to be the next striking point of
the Zhodani. If these fleets need one or two weeks to amass the system
might already be lost. The Zhodani has installed their Deep Meson Sites,
mines and so one throuout the system. Availability and readiness is the
key factors for the Navy to be efficent. It dosen\'t have time to run
around chasing pirates. Thats the job of the system defence boats and what
might be the Imperial Costal Guard, or Interstellar Police.

This really depends on the level of traffic and the level of
interplanetary travel. Like I said in the example above, if regulation of
traffic outside the 100-diamter limit is not economical viable, which I
think it isn\'t in most systems, there will be this small but real chance
for the pirate to strike as the traffic control gives you a route when you
have raeched the 100-diameter limit.

This falls apart as before if the Naval ship doesn\'t know who the pirate
and the victim is, which I think is really hard as given above.

Only way to avoid piracy is to have a close escort by every ship, else
there will always be a chance for the ship to become a victim.

But that depends on how the Navy is deployed. And here there is
disagreement. You tell me how large scale defence from invasion happens in
the Imperium when parts of the ships needed to defend against the invaders
are out hunting pirates.

No they are not, but securing their border against the outsides enemies
requires there to be large fleets in key systems. If they are scattered
around the system the invading force will just walk in and take the
Imperium. Its like defending NYC by putting a soldier on every corner. No
problem really as there are enough soldiers to do it in the USA. But then
the Europeans land a massive army on the beach and kills the few soldiers
there. The soldiers on the corners of the street running along the beach
uses on week to run down to the beach, and if they do this they will just
be horribly outnumbers, so they have to wait for the soliders in the city
running to the beachstreet corners, which is going to take weeks and even
months. This is in my view not a way to defend a border in the Traveller
Universe.

So you\'re basically saying that EV is a book with pictures and prices of
vehicles? I can get far better artwork at far better prices in any SF shop.
Hell, I can even use the Foss illos in the older T4 books as vehicles if
stats/TL etc are irrelevant.

Thinking back to first movie, it didn\'t seem to take very long

Well, no one really knows, but it would probably blow a lot of gas
off into space. Remember that comet that hit one of our local gas giants
earlier this year? (or was it last year? and which gas giant was it? I forget.)
A comet has at least as much energy as a good-sized load of nuclear missiles
but it didn\'t really do much, except create a few storms where it hit.

Combustion requires oxygen. There\'s no oxygen in a gas giant. Sorry.

Yeah and you can tell them apart by (my gosh) the wierd spiky things

Well, someone else got to be Team Klingon. Which, personally,
I don\'t mind, as Klingons appear to exist mainly to bug people
in the gift shops at Paramount amusement parks.

Anyhow, I figure someone has to be of the opinion that
Star Trek is generally dumb and at best, cheesy.

Has it ever come up that TCS and Striker might
just be wrong? I mean, I know they\'re canon, but
who says that either of them make the slightest bit
of sense? Hans\' arguments seem to center on extrapolations
from rules in two supplements that have nothing
to back them up save their "canon-ness".

Why should the economic rules in TCS or Striker be
accepted?

To me, this seems to be the root of a lot of disagreements.

Not really.  What I am _basically_ saying is that I have run a campaign for

that Emperor\'s Vehicles provides.  It is the perfect addition for my campaign
right now.  It doesn\'t get much better than that.

I didn\'t buy it for the artwork, but of course having more copies of Foss

Stats aren\'t irrelevant.  They just aren\'t needed that badly.  The overall
response does make me think of that anti-hunting bumper sticker I see here in
Colorado from time to time:  "Ask first if the animal wants to be killed."

I\'m not an anti-hunting advocate, just a _role_ _playing_ advocate.  Don\'t
just shoot first and ask questions later. :)

Not likely.

Remember, just a few years ago we saw a chain of comets striking
Jupiter, I\'m sure the equivilent megatonnage was quite high.

It would likely mess up the gg\'s "weather" patterns for a while. I\'m
really not sure exactly how much energy it would take to cause permanent

Me neither.

Lone pirates operating near virtually any world in the Imperium would be
so rare as to be non-existant. I don\'t see pirates of this type anywhere

I\'ve resisted becoming involved in this piracy thread since I feel so

argue against patrol ships being present at every planet is something I
can\'t agree with. So, I\'m renaming the subject and spawning another
thread in order to get a fresh horse. ;)

What would happen if the Zho\'s created a fleet of J-5 or even J-4
vessels, supported by some very large tankers; who jumped to cometary
fringes of systems, sneaking their way to the heart of the Marches, and
whipped ass at some undefended system?

The fact that ships are undetectable in jump, and that information
*cannot* travel than warships, means that it is *imperative* that a
fairly sizable defence is required at every major population world, and
that a modest force is required for even the smaller population centres.

Places too small to support a system defence force would have
insignificant trade to support piracy.

Therefore, I contend that any system with significant trade or resources
has its own planetary navy, even if it\'s a modest one, equivalent to the
"coast guard". If this denfence force isn\'t suppressing piracy during
peacetime, what the heck are they doing?

You\'ll have to patrol a bit deeper than jump-6 for reasons outlined
above. You *cannot* detect ships in jumpspace, and light doesn\'t travel
fast enough to track movements through an entire system. Your
information about their movements will rarely outpace the movements of a
high-jump capable fleet.

"Concentration of forces" == "big-ass ships". A whole fleet of puny
patrol vessels isn\'t going to mean squat when a Tigress jumps in. Sun
Tzu wrote about land battles, he knew naught of battleships and
dreadnaughts.

Smaller-sized ships are necessary in the navy for patrol, protection,
and smaller skirmishes; but in a major battle their role is limited, so
they don\'t need to be concentrated.

So I take the opposite view. The *majority* of places will have some
sort of defence fleet. Otherwise small, high-jump enemy warships will
kick your butt six ways from Sunday, and probably as many days a week.

In further defence of my assumption, realize that the Imperium is a
feudal system, with each planet being quite independent and likely to
maintain its own fleet, especially if it\'s population is sizable. The
very fact that there is such a high degree of information lag requires
that forces be relatively dispersed.


Here\'s my assumptions about naval deployment in the Traveller Universe,
which I believe are supported by canon:

- - Each planet has its own "planetary navy", composed mainly of small
escort vessels, SDB\'s, and patrol vessels. HiPop planets would even have
a few small cruisers.

  For the most part, these local "coast guard" type navies are more than
sufficient to stamp out lone pirates (ie. small merchant type vessels
outfitted with weaponry) Only larger vessels (corsairs etc.) supported
by other governments or corporations would have any chance of succeeding
in a piracy operation.

- - Each planet also supports the sector or subsector\'s Imperial navy, and
the Scout service.

- - The Imperial navy consists of mainly larger line of battle ships,
support vessels, some escorts, and high-jump rapid deployment warships.

- - Larger line-of-battle ships are deployed at naval bases during
peacetime and strategic hot-spots where threats are anticipated.

- - Rapid-deployment fleets are situated at naval bases and other
locations, always within one jump of every world aligned with the
Imperium. When news reaches them of a skirmish or major fleet movement,
they have a week to engage the enemy or deploy to the enemy\'s
anticipated target.

- - Scouts are deployed haphazardly and monitor fleet actions in systems
throughout the Imperium, paying particular attention to border areas.
During wartime, some even look in on enemy worlds past the border,
jumping in, taking a picture, refeuling if possible, and jumping out.
Perhaps 70% of these scouts are detatched duty scouts, who check in
every month or so at a scout base and download their sensor logs for the
edification of the IISS.


As I said, many of these thoughts come from absorption of traveller
sourcebooks, and my distant misty memories of the 5th Frontier War
boardgame... *sigh* it sure would be neat to see that game again.

size that was able to function in anything resembling an efficient and 
timely manner. I\'m sure that Piracy Reports do go out through the XBoat

involved with the sensor readings, etc., all in triplicate of course, filed
with
the proper authorities and with the correct signatures and seals, "filed,
lost,
filed again, and finally buried in peat for 6 months and recycled as fire
lighters."

Some members of the List seem to run campaigns in which the 3I is a 
omnipresent, omniscient presence in day to day affairs, which is alright 
if it works in your campaign. I thought 1984 was a great book and movie
but I wouldn\'t want to play in such a controlled society. My Third I is
much more like the Computer in Paranoia, a bumbling, autocratic, con-
fused favorite strange uncle who can\'t admit that it really doesn\'t have 
much of a clue :)

Such an omnipresent 3I also puts the lie into other standards in the game 
such as running from bounty hunters (if the 3I knows each and every 
ship down to the name of the 3rd Engineer\'s Mate\'s Dog, it certainly
can get accurate passenger lists) and the secret research bases and 
derelicts that litter most adventures (if you believe the 3I has the will
to place enough ships in every system to counteract pirates, it doesn\'t
take that much more of a leap to have charted every rock and piece of
debris in the system large enough to be a hazard, not to mention the 
fact that if Big Brother is watching every ship to be sure it doesn\'t get
mercenary twitches, it is certainly going to wonder why certain Belter
ships keep visiting a certain asteroid...)

Which brings up a point I\'ve been wishing to review for a while now: Just
how many ships *are* out there? We\'ve seen a bunch of capacity thrown 
about in the recent discussions using TCS (which I don\'t have :( ) and PE
(which I do); would anyone be interested in helping figure out how many
ships have been constructed (roughly) of various tonnages and what 
the likelihoods of running into them are? I\'ve wanted to do something like
this for a long time now, as I\'d like to get a more accurate impression of
just what one is likely to see parked/lifting off from your local spaceport
and flying in the local starlanes. I know of several charts that give chances
of running into ship to ship encounters when approaching planets, but 
given the massive amount of tonnage capacity that members keep 
throwing about on the List, it seems at times that the spacelanes ought to
look like I-285 during rush hour.

	first of all TNE : after a term as corsair a chacter has to roll

	So dont asume that pirates are stupid. If a SDB is in system the
	pirate will be either a normal trader, or big enough to attack
	the SDB first.

	Catching a merchant :

	- Get a high passage, intrude the computer befor jump, so that
	  the ship missjumps to a GG the pirate is waiting.
	- Destroy the SDB first, and wait for ariving merchants
	- Wait on a system without an SDB.

	IMHO piracy did not happen in the civilised areas. But can you
	tell me any campain playing in a civilised area. CT was frontier,
	MT was civil war, TNE was dark, and M0 is frontier again.

	Of course the 3I had SDBs to stop pirates most of its time,
	but those peacefull and secure times are considered boring, and
	not used for any of the canon backgrounds.

<clipity-clip>


Creationists make certain claims. The burden of proof is upon them to prove
these claims. Showing a flaw in evolutionary theory would not be enough to
prove their claims.

Cigarette manufacturers seem to claim that since research is not absolute
proof, it is invalid. This is incorrect. All that is required is reasonable
proof, not absolute proof (since absoulute proof is unattainable, except in
the case of logical impossibilities where there is only one possible
answer).

However, even if they were correct in saying what they do, they could not
claim cigarettes did not cause cancer (or whatever). They would have to
prove this claim themselves. Refutation of evidence is no more proof than
absence of proof.

Which brings me to the problem with the piracy thread. It is based on too
many assumptions. So many, it seems, that no one can argue either for or
against piracy logically. To do so would require objective proofs, not
subjective assumptions. Furthermore, taking the position "You can\'t prove
it, so nyahh!" proves nothing in itself. It is the equivalent of no
position.

When thinking of piracy, a clearly-written list of variables would be
helpful. Determining the psuedo-facts -- "canonizing" all of the variables
involved -- and then coming to a conclusion about piracy would be the way
to go. However, while this would be interesting to me personally, I doubt
that this method would work, because of differences of opinion on what is
"correct."

Without this, what do we have? An entertaining argument that is
philosophical in nature but unsolvable.

In any event, it seems both sides are at an impasse (and the middle is
having a field day saying "Nyahh, nyahh, nyahh!" <g>).

That is, unless anyone has a plan by which we can set up several
interstellar empires and run an experiment.

Hmm. Maybe Grandfather allowed access to jump space just to see how to
handle piracy in his game...

Wouldn\'t be easier (and less expensive) to arm every ship?

My questions (which I am sure was answered in one of the increasingly long
essays on piracy in the Imperium):

1) What is the average value of a ton of cargo (interstellar and/or
   interplanetary)?

2) How much does it cost to buy a ships\' weapon and crew it?

3) Would the cost of arming the ship and crewing the weapons be more than
   the cost of lost cargo (especially if piracy was a problem)?

4) How frequent is piracy? What are the odds of said ship leaving a port being
   asked to "heave to and prepare to be boarded?"

I hope that you instuctors apply a similar attitude towards grading you
work.  Tech level is the single most impotant thing to know about any
piecce of equipment.  Your Grummond breaks down on a world.  Are repair
parts avalible?  Does the local mechanic even know how to fix it?  If the
world is TL8 and the vehicle is TL9 I can say with a little authority that
the cahnces are low.  If the world is TL6 and the vehicle TL12, I can say
fat chance.

Leaving aside the inanity of the TL12 Imperium having *mechanized* units, I
ask you how often do we leave behind equpment?  What if the PC\'s want to
buy a new vehicle?  What if they want to order a custom version from the
factory?

No, but then I once carried a Sony Walkman into the jungles of Honduras.
Doesn\'t mean that I could get it repaired, or that the locals could
duplicate it.  Knowing the TL of manufacture is vital.

Quick.  How many crew does a M1A2 need?  A T-72M?  They\'re both main battle
tanks, and the M1 is of a higher tech than the T-72.

Surprise!  The M1A2 requires a crew of four.  Driver, gunner, loader, and
commander.  The T-72 only needs three.  It has an autoloader.  These facts
are not immediately obvious by looking at the vehicle.  How about an
AC-130? M-110 artillery vehicle?  A LAV-25?  How many modern vehicles still
require a radio operator?

I might also point out that most of the vehicles in EV do not have
illustrations.  Now, how do you kmow that the picture is of the Grummond?
The description states that the vehicle is armed with a 25mm cannon, and
that turret is far too small to accomidate that kind of firpower.  Judging
form the look, it appears that the vehicle illustrated is aremd with a
small MG and a 40-60mm grenade launcher.

Forgive me for not being as highly evolved as you.  However, since I do
this for fun, combat is a part of my gae, and in over twenty years of
gaming experience I have never seen a game that didn\'t resort to combat at
one point or another.

So for 99.9% of the gaming community, the stats for the weapons are of some
importance.

Nice dodge.  However, this wasn\'t "Big Gay Al\'s Big Book o\'Generic
Vehicles", this was supposed to be a collection of vehicles for Marc
Miller\'s Traveller.  I expect a product supporting a specific game system
to do it correctly.

You didn\'t answer his question ref.. "How much fuel are we gonna need to
support us for a week?"  If I don\'t like your answer, I\'m going to ask
where you got the answer from.  Then I\'m going to start argueing fuel
efficiencies, real-world engine output, and anything else I can think off
to get the advantage.

(Note: I wouldn\'t do this, but I\'ve met players who would.  That\'s why I
find the lack of detail in EV appaling.)

OK, so I\'m Wheeled Vehicle-3, Dex 8, and I\'m driving a vehicle with Ease

tasks? Or does it change the difficulty?  Or does it affect my skill?  It\'s

If the book had promised floorplans for the Virgin megastore, I would have

The whole point of supplements like these is to provide the Ref with an aid

I\'d sooner volunteer for a bone marrow transplant.  Compare this book to
Emperor\'s Arsenal.  Every weapon was listed with the correct, complete
stats, every weapon had a good illustration, and the book included useful
rules.  Emperors\' Vehicles has very few of the vehicles illustrated,
horribly incomplete stats, and no rules to speak of.

No, you are.  The Traveller Book was published seventeen years ago.  I\'d
like to think that we\'ve progressed a little beyond that level.  Also, CT
didn\'t have design tracks like FFS and the vehicle system from CSC.  We had
to kludge things together, at least until Striker came out.  (Craig can
probably remember that I vanished into my room, emerging days later with
about a hundred vehicle designs.)

As Leroy gets insulting again.  Fine.  I have been playing Traveller for
twenty years.  My first gaming purchase of any sort was 1001 Characters,
and I have an extensive collection of Traveller products that fills an
entire bookcase.  I find Emperor\'s Vehicles to be recycled puppy chow.

three military, one semi-military, one criminal, and *one* civilian career
paths.

I think that I remember our roots a little better than you..

For my players, the amount of fuel was largely irrelevant, simply becuase I
wanted them to be stuck in the middle of the desert, and so the Gray Death
legion shot the crap out of their jeeps, and all three had holed fuel
tanks!  Later, however, the fuel capacity was VERY important. Like Doug, I
prefer to have the information provided.

Quote 2

This is somewhat related to the above; when I got Striker, I immediately
scurried off into the darkness and designed a whole panoply of vehicles
based on WWII German designs, which I used to equip the Gray Death Legion
for the above-mentioned adventure (which became a long-running campaign in
its own right, with at least four encounters on separate worlds with the
GDL over a four year period).  This was very conventient for me, as I had a
butt-load of 1/48 scale german vehicle models that I repainted as GDL
vehicles, and which were a staple of our game sessions for quite a long
time.

I was cleaning out my shed over the weekend and found a box with some of
these models.  Alas, the Arizona heat and the heavy box stacked on top of
this one had put most of the models to an untimely end, but I did retreive
three (a command car, an APC and a tank destroyer) which I hope to clean up
and spring on my players again in the near future!  Since the current party
is mostly the sons/daughters of the group that fought the GDL (its nearly
50 years later!), it should raise some surprised eyebrows.



Regarding the Emperor\'s Vehicles book; I created a number of the designs in
that book, and I had a heck of a time trying to figure out which ones were
mine, and what had been done to them.  There were some changes, but mostly
the missing information made it difficult to tell what was what.  The
original models for my designs were the M-113, the LAV-25, the M1A2 and the
M-2 Bradley, plus some "independant" designs.  Ah well; the book is not too
bad, but I am going to have to mark it up to include the data I need (which
will entail making some assumptions which may or may not be correct).

There is no oxygen to react with so no combustion.

Yes, Yes.  I know that.  The point is not that mass and inertia

that described any problems with mass and inertia that hadn\'t
been addresses (inertia is a pretty straight forwared problem).

This, as I have said, is the mistake people keep making
over and over again when looking at Imperial budgets.
As you said above, things do change when the numbers
get large, but it goes the other way.

Large organization don\'t have a "noise floor".  It is often
true that a large organization tracks expenses down to a
more detailed level, both in terms of absolute money and in
%age of budget, because they can and they need to.  <1%
is not in the "noise floor" for the Federal Government
and, while it wastes money because of politics, it doesn\'t
waste money because it can\'t be bothered with deciding
what to do with it.  The Imperium in not going to blow
thousands to millions of megacredits on piracy if it\'s
not justified, regardeless of what %age of the budget
that is.

You need a "decent transfer rate".  You don\'t need to rocket
them accross, turning them into missles.  You just start moving
one accross at a brisk walk, after all it\'s not like you have
to wait for the previous one to be fully transfered to start
the next one.

The fact is when you start training for a problem and

if you are doing it on an ad hoc basis.  If you want to
really look at how hard the problem is, you have to take
it into account.   The fact that we have been discussing
pretty crude methods (which, none the less, are still
reasonable solutions) means that someone who is prepared
like a pirate _will_ tend to have an easier time.

Unless you want to arbitrarly say that only pirates that
are unprepared will engage in piracy, then the point that
we haven\'t even explored more than the obvious solutions
is a germain one.

piracy is, like most crimes, a something that a merchant
is likely to never presonally encounter, then he won\'t be

You need a "decent transfer rate".  You don\'t need to rocket
them accross, turning them into missles.  You just start moving
one accross at a brisk walk, after all it\'s not like you have
to wait for the previous one to be fully transfered to start
the next one.

Not much would happen. There\'s nothing there to burn - hydrogen requires
oxygen or carbon or *something* to burn, and all the carbon etc. is already 
burnt (locked up in methane, etc.) No number of nuclear missiles will manage to
comrpess the hyrdogen enough to istart fusion - and even if it did, the fusion
would stop when the compression did. basically you get a big bang, some
serious weather effects, maybe some long-lasting scars, not much else. 
(Compare to the SL/9 impact on Jupiter, which is oprobably more energetic 
than a typical load of missiles.)

No tech level, no fuel usage, hmmm.... I see that as a problem. I buy a
book for statistics, that uses design system I paid for, so that I can use
it as a cross check for my own designs or inspiration for others.

I don\'t need to buy a book that lacks a design system in order to roleplay.

My imagination does a perfectly fine job as it is, and can come up with the
detail (or lack of detail) that exists in Emperor\'s Vehicles at a moments
notice, and I don\'t have to pay A$30 for it.

By your analogy Leroy, Emperors vehicles is a perfectly good supplement for
Space Opera, Mechwwarrior, Rifts, or any other science fiction system. I
sometimes wonder if this is the purpose of the book. T4 being the hopeless
system that it is maybe IG are trying to make their products more generic
so that they can be sold for use with other roleplaying games (GURPS?). 

Anyway, that\'s just my opinion.

OK for those of you annoyed at my late questions well here\'s another
one....I\'m on Oct 7 TML\'s and will remain at some state of TML
regression until I am finished with my orals on Nov. 4......then all
will be sunshine and light....yeah right....until then I hope you will
continue to put up with me. :->

Anyway Rob,  you keep saying that walking speed is a function of gravity
(I assume because the higher the gravity the faster you "fall" into the
position to take the next step) so I have two questions:

1) If strength were not a factor....does this mean that you can walk up
a hill faster than you can on flat terrain (the ground rising to meet
your foot as opposed to falling toward the ground faster)

2) From the MIT Leg Lab.....is there any idea of the optimum gravity for
the fastest walking speed given that a person has a given strength and
endurance.  (I know this question is not well phrased...but what I am
looking for is....well...if gravity increases you can walk faster....but
it takes more effort.  Increase gravity again and you can go still
faster but now you are struggling to get the strength to do it so you go
slower.  Is there and optimal range for a healthy, unassisted
human.......or did Goldielocks find out that 1G is "juuuuust right"?)

Thanks

  Is that referring to (forward?) deployed elements or the number of
ships in being? Certainly most of the large ships used in a war of
less than four or five years length (varies by tech, size) will be
those already existing at the outbreak of hostilities, whether in
active/reserve service or in storage. That appears to be the pattern
in the T* universe, and matches most historical scenarios (post-galley).

Well, if I remember, you do give off radiation when you come
out of jump (is that a recent T4 thing?).  In any case, it
depends on how "canon" you want to be.  You don\'t, in
fact, see navies typically (at all?) using the Ort cloud
(or the Kieper Belt) to pull water out of comets in histories.
I\'ve hear it claimed that this would be detected too.
OTOH, there are those who argue passionately that this
is dumb, and that this should be happening all the time.
I have seen flame wars over this and didn\'t follow them
close enough to have a good idea which side I believe.

In any case, if you believe in this, the best response
is still not a fleet in every system.  It is a fleet
concentrated in a few high value systems and have a
small scout ship in each system (maybe one patrolling
through 2 or 3 systems).

>Places too small to support a system defence force would have
>insignificant trade to support piracy.

Well, no.  First, trade from big systems has to pass through
small systems.  Also, you only need to be middling sized before
you don\'t have a fleet sitting around protecting you...

>Therefore, I contend that any system with significant trade or resources
>has its own planetary navy, even if it\'s a modest one, equivalent to the
>"coast guard".

Well, I agree that they will have enough ships that any
armed ship can\'t just show up an terrorize they system
for weeks on end.  But that is a long way from being
able to stop hit an run attacks in every part of the
system.

>"Concentration of forces" == "big-ass ships". A whole fleet of puny

Actually, this is a fundamental principal that has held
up in all types of warfare through the ages (that is
why he is still studied).  Also concentration means
_both_ big ships, and concentrating the ships
you have.  A bunch of Cruisers might be able to defeat
a deadnaught together, but if the dreadnaught can
hit them one by one they are toast.

>Smaller-sized ships are necessary in the navy for patrol, protection,
>and smaller skirmishes; but in a major battle their role is limited, so
>they don\'t need to be concentrated.

Small ships are necesary for patrol, but the firepower needed
for patrol is a fraction necessary to stop piracy (actually
it\'s not clear that you bother to arm them at all since their
only mission will be to leave immediately).  There
is also a need to escort but you will group your merchants
into convoys so you probably will used at least modest
sized fleets and you don\'t need that manys. You aren\'t going
to be sending small forces out to seek out battle
because they will get squashed.  All this is a long
way from having a small fleet in every system.

Neah, what ends up happening is that the small ship runs
around bothering small, low value targets (which have few fixed
instalations and your small ships isn\'t going to sieze and hold
a planet, besides something like 90% of the Imperiums pop
and resources are in a few high pop worlds so it really isn\'t
a big deal if he does) until it happens  to run into a larger
force or a world that was bigger than he thought, and get squashed.
The problem with one small ship is he only survives as long
he has a perfect record in picking where to go next, which is
tough even without the slow communications we see in
Traveller.

   Because they are quite compatable with real life, so there is
   no real reason not to accept them.  TCS assumes that the naval
   budget per citizen is about Cr 250.  In the US today, the naval
   budget comes out to about $360 per citizen.  These values are
   roughly comparable.  TCS assumes a fleet size with a value 10
   times the annual budget.  In the US today, the price tag on our
   fleet is roughly 5 to 10 times the annual budget.  Again, these
   values are roughly comparable.  In his arguments, Hans assumes
   that piracy suppression gets about 0.2% of the fleet budget.
   In the US today, our Coast Guard gets a whole lot more than 0.2%
   of the naval budget, so clearly this value is EASILY credible.

Well, the one I\'ve seen claim not that research can never be
abolute proof, but the the research done so far hasn\'t proven
that cigarets cause cancer.

Right, this why it depends on what you claim.  If you seek to claim
that cigarettes don\'t cause cancer you have a much higher burden
of proof than if you a content to mearly contend that cigarettes
have not been proven to cause cancer, since the later means that
you don\'t have to prove a postion, only show that another
postion is flawed.

Which is good for me since my postion is that you can\'t say piracy
is either impossible or required by the background.

  Maybe we should clarify what sort of ship gobbles up an SDB,
even under near-ideal conditions? Remember, the SDB doesn\'t
have 20%+ wasted on J-fuel/drives, let alone cargo, nor does
it require commercial rates of return on its\' military gear
costing. For distances, I\'ll ignore traffic control, but on
inbound ships "accidentally" matching their in-Jump is quite
astronomically unlikely, and I\'m going to be very suspicious
of any ship that seems to be approaching me and not the world
I\'m heading for. The authorities may share this approach.

  Problem is that I haven\'t either, and most earlier versions never

  If insurance is cheaper than a one-time investment of a couple
hundred KCr, then piracy doesn\'t exist, as it doesn\'t seem to
affect insurance rates. I feel that there are some (possibly
specialized) circumstances where piracy exists (not just hijacking,
skipping, fraud, etc.), but this thesis would eliminate that.

  IIRC, you can jump in (accurately) with a relative velocity.
If there\'s a danger of piracy, they would. This means that to
match becomes almost impossible randomly, and would occur well 
within security forces "my-what-fun" zone. I\'d have to check
the canon jump stuff, though.

Unfortunately, this position is of little help to a referee looking for
advice. :)

On another note, one of my concerns is that people are starting to get a
little ... touchy ... about this subject. To me, many of the arguments are
enjoyable to read, and it would be a real shame if people got bent out of
shape and stopped contributing. Both sides have made excellent points,
things that I would not have thought of myself. This concern is motivated
out of self-interest, of course -- I would like to hear more good points.
:)

Perhaps we can clarify and simlify this thread by breaking it down into
it\'s component arguments. Any clear thinkers with an archive of this Piracy
thread want to make up a laundry list of variables to consider? It might be
a good exercise of "universe building 101." No opinions, just the
variables? I am too lazy (and without an archive) to do it myself.

I think you get the same problem in PE.  I picked a copy of PE the other
day, and have been working on harmonising the military system with WTH,
Striker, INH, TCS, & a host of other MT/CT/TNE material.  I have not got far
yet, but I think at this stage that any consistency will be purely
coincidental:  
For what its worth, at TL15 on an appropriate world, an RU = 5000 MCr, and a
(puny) A1D1T0J4 Starship unit will cost (1*50+1*50+8*50)= 500 Ru or approx 2
500 000MCr.   Enough for lots of little ships, or  a couple of Batrons of
old Tigress class BBs (CT) or about 6-8 really big BBs in TNE, or 1-4 BBs
from Starships of the Imperium (or whatever it was called) in MT.  
Interestingly, Since all units in PE have the same strength across TL, the
smae units costs 2,275,000MCr at TL14, and 3, 000,000 MCr at Tl 13.  Whilst
it is true that as TL decreases, effectiveness decreases AND cost increases,
(in accordance with FF&S v1/2), I do not know if this works out in any of
the starship combat rules in the same proportion as it does in PE, but I may
check this out with BL and BR.
If you only want to build SDBs they cost (for A1D1) 100 RU or about 50 000
MCr worth.  

To put this into perspective: for a Tl 13 Pop 9 (actually 2x10exp9) world
(all calculated according to PE) which had about 4% spent GWP on Military
gave approx 648 RU spent on maintenance, or a force size of 216 RU.  If only
.3 of this were assigned to the imperial navy (see below) for consistency\'s
sake, this would be 64.8 Ru on maintenance if inerstellar military.  If we
were maintaining A1D1J8 (Jump 4 capable starfleets)which cost 30 Ru each we
could maintain 2 of them, call it A2D2J16, This has a value (see above) of 2
x 3 000 000 MCr or 6 000 000 MCr (in local credits, starport Type A)[If all
was spent on interstellar military, approx 21 000 000]

The same figure for TCS are approximately 2 000 000 000  x 500/1 000 000 or
1 000 000 MCr and can be multiplied by up to 10 to account for the gradual
construction of the fleet or 10 000, 000 MCr.  (Imperail navy only)

For striker/INH these figures are:
2 000 000 000 x 3/100 (3%) x 18 000/1 000 000 x .3 (for imperial forces
only- not including system defence of this world) or 324 000MCr or for the
biuggest fleet (as per TCS above) 3 240 000 MCr.

Note that this is only a 2x10EXP9 world...
ERRORS PROBABLE

 It doesn\'t seem to matter what system you use, the imperium has ENORMOUS
resources at its dispposal.

   And their ability to disappear on command, sort of like everyone does
when the boss comes out of his office looking to assign someone a
project.  Hey, I\'m just trying to keep in the spirit of the business
discussions!  :-)

   Attaching rubber pieces to the face is a cheaper, easier way to
create aliens.  It\'s one step above putting humans in funny clothes and
pretending that they are from another planet.  Many sci-fi shows were
guilty of that, including old Star Trek and most episodes of Dr. Who.

   Star Trek at its best is the some of the best sci-fi around.  At its
worst, it is some of the worst.  Don\'t get me started on the *major*
issues I have with the latest incarnation "Voyager", or as I like to
call it, "the aircraft carrier that would not die, though everyone
wishes Nelix would".

   Regardless of our opinion, it is a billion dollar enterprise (pardon
the pun).  Star Trek is extremely popular with sci-fi fans in particular
and the public in general.  If only Traveller had 10 percent of the
success Star Trek has had over the years.

   From what I\'ve seen of your reviews Leroy, IG could print a book with

   So is deciding whether or not to purchase a sourcebook based upon if
it provides enough information to justify its purchase, or whether the
referee would be better off going to the public library, looking some
vehicles up in a Jane\'s yearbook, and then fudging the numbers for his
own campaign.

   As listing the tech level at which something is constructed is a
Traveller tradition dating back over 15 years (and three game systems)
why suddenly stop now?  Looking through my copy of "The Traveller Book"
(copyright 1982), the tech level is listed for all vehicles.

   Of course not, but their tech level is listed anyway (at least up
until now).

   So I now have to guess crew requirements by looking at pictures of
vehicles.  Well now there\'s an elegant solution for you.  BTW, TTB lists
the crew requirements for the vehicles listed there.

   I never figured you for a pacifist Leroy, especially given the
personal attacks you have launched against people over the Internet
(myself included).  However, just because *you* don\'t like to give your
characters access to anything larger than handguns and the occasional
gauss rifle doesn\'t mean that everyone else should be forced to run
their game that way.  Some of the *best* pure role-playing sessions I
ever ran involved people running around in battledress and grav APCs,
hunting down bad guys with some serious TL 12 firepower.

   Lack of relevant information as a design feature.  Oh boy.  Who would
have thought that having to do everything myself made the product
superior?  and here all this time I thought that the best products were
ones that saved the referee time.  Thanks for clearing that up.

   Or just go down to the local public library and get the relevant
information for free and save US$30.  For a gunship, I recommend the
AH-64 Apache.  Figuring out some butt kicking TL 12 stats for the grav
equivalent shouldn\'t be that hard if you have a few hours to kill.

   The correct answer Andrew is that you decide whether or not you are
getting your money\'s worth, and if not, don\'t buy it.  It sounds like
this book is just fine for people like Leroy, but if you want more
detail and you don\'t want to have to work for it, look for something
else.

>Look, if I\'m unemployed
>and can buy these books, it can\'t be that hard for someone else.

   Speaking as someone who was until very recently unemployed, I find
that the whole IG product line is unaffordable, and even if it were,
unjustifiable given that I already own three versions of the game.  In
other words, speak for your damn self.

   Andrew is not looking for the final word on anything, just some

provide.

   Leroy is right Andrew, you must learn to lower your expectations when
it comes to IG products.  Accept that you will be charged more and will
get less for your money.  Until you can, you\'re just going to have to
use those heretical TNE manuals Leroy so detests.

   Which shows how out of touch you are.  The majority of Traveller
referees *want* to be told the answers up front, and then decide if the
numbers provided fit with their campaigns.  All too frequently referees
don\'t have time to fudge up a bunch of numbers themselves.

   One problem: even in classic Traveller information about vehicles
such as TL and crew requirements were included in the description.

   As for WW, it is a game that generally appeals to people who would
not otherwise not be playing RPGs.  The typical user of WW products
around here (Ohio) is part of the fine arts crowd, who sees their gaming
sessions as an excuse to practice their acting skills.  There are also
what I like to call "The Geeks In Black", but that\'s another story--even
they wouldn\'t be caught dead (or undead) playing Traveller.

I\'ll go for what I know in the Marches ...

Lets have a go at IN shipping ... approx 12 ships per squadron, one
squadron per naval base, 5 navel bases per subsector. So in the Marches
the IN has approximatly 660 ships in squadrons , given that the 3I only
approximatly 11 subsectors of the Marches.

Now lets have a go at large civilian shipping, Al Mora, has around 60 
(Spinward marches campain) and whachmacallem lines (the one in the
Traveller Adventure) has over 100 ships and works out of three
subsectors.

Now add the ships of the MegaCorps, the Subsector Lines, the fledgling
lines, the interface lines, and the free traders, and civilian shipping
starts to catch up.

The Navy get to add the reserve fleet (equal number), the colonial fleets
(perhaps double the number) and the system squadrons (5 times the number
?) this, if my number assumptions are feasable, comes to approximatly
6000 ships, and this dosn\'t include non squadron ships, (perhaps double
this number ?). So if we settle for 12000 ships in some navy or another in
the Marches, and then say that there are 300 Imperial worlds in the
Marches, that makes 40 Navy ships per system ( ...... Wow ...... )

I get to a slight problem with Merchant shiping cos I don\'t know how or
where to base the numbers on, how many subsector lines per subsector ? how
manyn interface lines (one per subsector border, approx 12) ? Only one
Sector Line (Al Mora), and what 10 MegaCorps with shipping interests ...
This overlooks fledgling lines, and free traders ....... Mind numming ...

Now we come to the real good bit .... Are Scouts Civilian or Military ? ...
cos the scouts probably have more ships in the Marches than anyone else
... let me see .... one ship at least per day arriving in each direction
allong the Xboat routes, say two per station spare incase the incomming
Xboat is faulty .... one station per direction, per system, one xboat
tender per station.

Way stations .... ? Scout stations .... ? And not to mention that the
scouts have soo many ships that they regulaly give one away for good
service to x personel on detached duty .... (one in six times ? mustering
out)  Who whants to add these figures up ? .... ;-)

Lots, and Lots, and Lots or starships ... they say the air is a crouded
place, well in the Marches space is chocker block ...

It depends. Some USL ships will be intended to land on airless worlds
(like the moon). So they\'d have landing gear strong enough for such
landings. But such worlds are almost always low g (I don\'t feel like
digging thru the books to see what the max world size is that can have
a vacuum atmosphere). So even ignoring atmospheric effects, they
wouldn\'t be able to land on some worlds.

But many (most?) USL ships aren\'t even *intended* to land. They are
built that way because it\'s *cheaper* to build  them that way for
shuttling cargo between highports at civilized worlds. Sort of like the
supertankers that can\'t even enter most ports because they\'ve got too
deep a draft.

It makes it easier to deal with the ground, but it also means being a
*long* ways from the planet (the orbits that the Shuttle, Mir, and a
lot of other stuff use are around 200-500 km up, synchronous orbit is
about 37,000 km up). Call it 100 times as far away. 

Planets that have highports wiull tend to have at least one part of it
in synchrounous orbit, simply because that\'s convenient for the
*planet*. (It also gives them more time to try an intercept if a
terrorist type snewaks in).

Not unless they are docked with a highport. That orbit is too useful
for planet oriented sattellites like commsats and weather sats.

Actually, the orbits will be contsatrained in a couple of ways. First,
you have the problem that if the port isn\'t on the equator, an orbit
that passes over it on one pass, will pass quite a ways to one side of
the port on the next. It *is* possible to set up orbits that pass over
it more frequently, but it gets harder. Essentially, you either wind up
with a tilted syncronous orbit (and pass over the port once a day) or
you can pass over it more often, but it requires a lot of calculating I
don\'t feel like doing right now!

If the port is on the equator, it gets easier as *any* equatorial orbit
will pass over it regularly.

Since the port probably *isn\'t* on the equator, then the orbit of the
ship is likely inclined to the equator by at *least* the latitude of
the port (ie if it\'s at 30 degrees north, then the orvit *has* to be
inclined by at least 30 degress or else it\'ll never pass over the
port). It can be inclined by more. 

The other constraint on things is that people like things to be "even"
So orbital periods that work out to convenient units of time. Either
even faractions of the planet\'s day, or "round" numbers (90 min, 2
hours, that sort of thing).

A lot depends on what sort of sensors there are on the ground, and what
kind of communications system the people on the ground have. After all,
if they even have 1920s tech, they can merely make a phone call to a
radio station that has line of sight on the other ship and radio for
help from there! The good news is that even if he makes a major effort,
it\'s going to take *time* to get his ship there. Many minutes. Figure
it\'ll take him between 1.2 and 1/4 of the period of the orbit you have
him in (ie for a 90 minute orbit, between 45 minutes and 23 minutes)

If he\'s below the horizon he can\'t scan. And in low orbit, the time
when you can scan a given chunk of the planet is pretty short. For
example, a few weeks back, Mir was visible from Portland. It crossed
from horizon to horizon in something like 5 minutes!

Also, since he\'s likely in an inclined orbit, there are going to be
extended periods when he\'s below the horizon from a given point for a
*long* time.

Given that the crew is supposed to be experienced spacers, anybody who
can do astrogation can figure out the other ship\'s orbit and how long
it\'ll be out of sight from a given place on the ground.

The general rule involves math and a calculator. Sorry, but that\'s the
way it works. Speed depends on distance from the planet\'s center *and*
on how massive the planet is.

The mass of the Earth times the Gravitational constant (GM) is
approximately 4e14 m^3/s^2 (3.986e14). In Traveller, non gas-giants are
assumed to have the same density as Earth. And a Size 8 planet is
assumed to have the same mass as Earth.

9	7.2e6	1.42	   5.68e14
A	8.0e7	1.95	   7.79e14	


Orbital velocity = sqrt(GM/r)
Orbital period   = 2 pi/(Sqrt(GM/r^3))

The r in the equations is the orbital radius, which has to be bigger
than the R in the table (the radius of the planet).

Since you may want to run the orbital period calc backwards, I\'ll
re-write the equation for you.

r=cuberoot(GM/(2pi/P)^2)

P= orbital period

so for a 90 minute orbit around a size 8 planet, you need a radius of:

r=cuberoot(3.99e14/(6.28/5400)^2)   (90 min=5400 sec)
r=6.66e6 meters or 260 km above the surface.


But as I noted above, if anybody has the required skill in astrogation
(or whatever they are calling the skill these days) then he can figure
things out (an "average" task). The hard part will be that depending on
where the other ship is in relation to the planet you may have to wait
several days for a favorable configuration (ie something where you\'ve
got a couple of hours or more "clear").

    'body' => 'Piracy is business. Business has booms, recessions and steady periods in
different areas and times. 

The Imperial Navy has the resources to stop all piracy, everywhere. I\'m now
convinced of that. But at what price? Not just the credits, but the price
of ships that could be elsewhere doing other things, like being cheap to
maintain in mothballs, or exercising for fleet operations in the Umpteenth
Frontier War. 

In every campaign, the referee will have to make a decision: Is piracy
really feasible in this place at this time? Yes/No. Or are there better
ways for would-be pirates to make their money (merchanting, smuggling,
mercenary work, hiring out as High Guard for undeveloped worlds.... etc).

At some times in some places the Imperial interest will be distracted.
Piracy may have a boom. Then Measures Will Be Taken - Convoy, Escorts,
Battleship Deployments (!), etc etc. Piracy will have a decline and
recession. There will be the odd incident as some fool/genius tries a new
trick.

The answer to the whole piracy debate is this: Piracy is always possible,
and it\'s always possible to stop it. Whether it does get stopped depends on
tons of outside factors, but mainly what else is going on to distract the
ships, and how much the piracy is hurting the economy.

The referee will decide in his/her campaign, what effect these factors will
have, and should \'determine the flow of subsequent events\'. It\'s not a
single issue. It\'s a complex system of will, intent and resources. One
could probably use Complexity Theory (Chaos Theory) to do a full analysis,
based upon known data, but who cares? The ref makes up his/her mind, based
upon what makes a good game and is believable, and gets on with it.


Piracy occurs in my campaign. Occasionally. In some places it\'s rife, and
mixed with other wrongdoing. In other places it doesn\'t happen at all.
These sitautions change over time. The Imperium\'s spaceways are a complex
system in which almost anything is POSSIBLE. What actually happens is my
decision.

Except that you still haven\'t explained where he shows up from. In space
there is no place to hide. Until you explain that, your attack by surprise

The canonical sources certainly assumes so. Most of the Free Traders that
have been featured in past Traveller adventures have been armed (I say
"most", but I really can\'t remember a single one that wasn\'t).

Conveniently ignoring that by those encounter tables pirates constitute
11.6% of all encounters.

David, you really should try to cure yourself of trying to have things
one way when it suit you and another when it dosen\'t suit you. This
chimmerical pirate of yours -- able to pose as and make a decent
living as an innocent merchant one minute and capable of sneaking up
on a merchant and disable it in one shot the next, not to mention both
willing and able to gang up on and defeat military vessels at the drop
of a hat is getting very tiresome. Please settle on one approach at a
time and try to demonstrate that it would have a decent chance of
working. If you can demonstrate that any one approach will work, I\'ll
concede the argument.

And the big systems will have the naval vessels to put a patrol in those
intermediate systems. Your own argument about what appears worthwhile and
what does not tells against you here. If it has been 20 years since
anyone have attacked you and only a short time since someone pirated a
ship, keeping all your cruisers tied down to your home system will seem
a total waste of available assets.

While I find your suggestion that any navy would not arm any ship, no matter
how small, the best they could extremely... implausible, I agree that 
dedicated scouts wouldn\'t be any use in dealing with a pirate. Just how
many dedicated scouts a navy would want instead of more all-round useful
ships is another matter.

But those escorts won\'t be used for convoys in peacetime, so they will be
available for patrol duty.

Do you just assume that or do you have any concrete reason to believe so?
After all, the enemy will want to concentrate too, and it\'s to your
advantage to force him to disperse. If you have a dozen raiding squadrons
out harassing his back country, he will be forced to disperse his ships
to deal with you. Likewise he will want to force you to disperse your
forces, so he will have raiders of his own that you will need patrols to
counter.

>All this is a long way from having a small fleet in every system.

We have ample canonical evidence for these kinds of ships. These ships does
exist in the official Traveller universe (and they will exist in any
Traveller universe I either referee or run a PE in), and they are no bloddy
use against a surprise attack on a major world, so why should any sane
admiral _not_ spread them out across the systems he is supposed to protect?

Do you really have the opinion of human nature that is implied by this
cold-blooded accountant\'s viewpoint? Or are you just assuming it in order
to win an argument? There are plenty of historical examples of battles
being fought and resources squandered to protect insignificant, out-of-
the-way places.

In which case he has a good chance of escaping by jumping (you\'re not
suggesting that a raider captain wouldn\'t do his damndest not to arrive
in a new system with dry tanks, are you?)

>or a world that was bigger than he thought, and get squashed.

Yes, well, war is a risky business. What you haven\'t shown is that it
is too risky to jump around with a small squadron of raiders. But I
can tell you this: If his opponent disposes of his forces the way you
suggest it will certainly be a lot less risky than otherwise.

Not if his opponent\'s fleet is constituted the way you claim is the only
true way. All the ships are big ships and concentrated at the big worlds,
remember?

It certainly has. They may be wrong, but they are fairly reasonable. You
can fiddle with a bit (and that is one of the approaches I use in my own
Traveller universe), but they seem a lot more reasonable than pirates.

They are of the same order of magnitude as present-day military expenses,
so they can\'t be totally off.

It depends on what *you* define "standard orbit" as *meaning*. Do you
mean that the orbit has a standard period? If so, is it fixed (like 120
minutes) or fixed with respect to the planet\'s day (1/12th local day)?

Or is it defined by size. In which case the choices are altitude
(height above planet\'s surface), radius (height above center of
planet). Or even something like "planet subtends an angle of X when
viewed from the ship)

> I\'d like to be able to figure this out for any planet I come to.

See the equations in my other post. If you define some sort of
"standard orbit", then you can calculate it in adcvance if you go with
any of the above except the "fraction of planet\'s day" version. Though
I\'d hate to have to do the trig to convert that "subtends an angle" bit
into an altitude (actually, it\'d be proportional to the planet\'s radius,
but I\'ve done enough calculating generating that table!)

In any case, just remember that even though Star Trek keeps throwing
around the term "standard orbit", there is no such thing *defined*
anywhere. So it doesn\'t *mean* anything.

No, you could maintain position above a point, but you wouldn\'t be in
*any* orbit, because you are thrusting! Orbits are *by definition* zero
thrust.

No kidding. And between the power consumption and the mess you\'d be in

I don\'t think you can *get* a 60 minute orbit around any Traveller
planet. The orbital period gets *longer* as the planet gets smaller (a
"surface" orbit of a size 1 planet takes four hours!). And a 90 min
orbit of a size 8 is only 200 km up. (I just checked. it\'s not possible
on a size 10, you\'d have to be 2000 km uderground!)

So 60 minute orbits are *out*.

A ship is a *dangerous* object. So traffic control will be a lot more
important than with aircraft. The path won\'t be assigned from an
"office". It\'ll be asigned by a "controller" who is watching sensor
displays and knows both what the other traffic in the volume is doing
and what the normal "approach lanes" and restricted volumes are. Just
like air traffic controllers now. But it\'ll be pretty high stress. An
airliner can take out a couple of blocks worth of houses. A starship
can take out a *city*. That\'s why deviating from your assigned course
might just get you shot at...

Why would you get a similar path? The planet has moved. So you are
leaving with a *different* vector than the other ship did and from a
different *position*, making the optimum path to jump (even for the
same destination) *different*.

Because it\'s easier to get close to another ship when you are closer to
the planet. And if *you* can jump, a ship that is being attacked might
just decided it\'s safer to jump "early" than to stick around.

Huh? The whole idea is that this way you are going to be near ships
that have just exited jump, and you\'ll likely be somewhat close to them
until STC gets you sorted out. Also, it means that the planet doesn\'t
have much info on who you are.

If you start from the planet, you\'ll not be near the *incoming*
traffic. Nobody would route traffic that way. And the olanet will have
had a nice, long, *close up* look at you.

It\'s not killing gratutitously. Piracy carries the death penalty. And
in that scenario, unlike the one where you don\'t have help onboard,
they can *identify* you.

It\'s one thing to surrender and dump cargo or allow a bunch of folks in
space armor to unload your cargo. It\'s quite different if they are
taking over the ship (either by hijaacking or after boarding). 

And you are overlooking the fact that while it is good for
pirates-in-general to encourage folks to surrender, it\'s to the
interest of any *specific* group of pirates to eliminate witnesses. 
All it takes is *one* pirate group doing it to cause everyone to assume
that pirates are going to kill them. So there\'s actually little
advantage to it.

So? You think that they aren\'t going to put all the info they have on
you on the next Xboat? That\'s like not wearing a mask when robbing a
bank, because you\'ll be leaving town anyway.

G-tanks have been a staple of SF since at least the 1940s. They are
basicly a cross between a water filled tank that you "float" in, and a
waterbed. (Heinlein invented *both* ideas!) Thge idea being that since
you are evenly "supported", the G effects aren\'t as severe. Instead of
worrying about getting crushed into the padding on an acceleration
couch, you have to worry about the tissues if your body getting pressed
into each other, and getting pulled away from each other (and your
bones) depending on whether they are above or below your skeleton.

Well, while "EMS" is a bit cryptic, a neutrino sensor is obviously a
device that senses neutrinos. And a densitometer is a device that
measures density or density differences. This is plain from the way
words are put together in English. If you don\'t know what neutrinos are
or what density is, then you look them up in a dictionary.

Just like if you didn\'t know what something was in a gane set in WWII,
you look it up.

There\'s a fundamental problem with doing this. We can describe EMS
sensors because we already have them and know how they work. And thus,
other than giving a definition "Electromagnetic Spectrim Sensonsors",
we really don\'t *need* to say much, because being real (even somewhat
*common*) devices, you can look up details in real books.

We may be able to work up some rules on densitometers/mass detectors,
because someone has invented *one* type. Which means a lot more
handwaving as it\'s not vlear what is essential and what\'s optional, nor
what all the rules and limits are.

Neutrino sensors get *really* hard because the only known ways of
detecting them just plain won\'t work for what traveller has them doing,
and in fact, there are good reasons to consider the things they do in
traveller to be *impossible*.

Jump drive is even worse, because *all* we know is that it takes up so
much space, requires a hull grid, uses up a lot of fuel, and dumps you
into "jump space" (whatever that is) for about a week, and you come out
elsewhere according to the rules in the books; we *don\'t* lmow anything
about them or how they work. They don\'t exist, and the *only* info is
the rules regarding building them, and using them. That\'s *it*.

If we put anything else in, we are not *explaining* the game, we are
"defining" it. That\'s one of the big *objections* to the SOM. It tried
to explain things that weren\'t in the rules, and in several places, it
fell flat on it\'s face by either contradicting rules the author hadn\'t
remembered, or by contradicting *reality* (ie, stating as fact things
that COULD NOT be correct).

So if you want more info on what a jump drive "is" ir "how it works",
you either have to make it up, or try talking the folks who have the
final say on stuff (Marc, mostly) into fleshing out the gray areas in
the rules.

There are a number of them regarding jump drive. The biggest ones are
how close you come out to the point you were aiming for (not defined
*anywhere*) and exactly how your velocity at the start of jump relates
to your velocity at the end of jump.

These are actually important to the play of the games as opposed to
"cosmetics" like "what does it look like". And there are a lot of
half-way things like "what\'s a jump entrance/exit look like?", "What\'s
jump space look like?", "What happens if I do XX while the ship is in
jumpspace?".

If the Imperium is spending the money to defend itself in the event of war
and the effect of making piracy impossible is a fringe benefit then the
Imperium is not spending _any_ money on piracy suppression and the merchants
gets their "free lunch".

>Maybe one can see how it _might_ happen, but that doesn\'t prove piracy
>wouldn\'t exist.

Except that
    1) It is established roughly how much the Imperium thinks is
       necessary to spend on the navy.
    2) It is established that some of this is being used to buy and
       run small ships.
    3) These small ships are no use as defensive forces and they are not
       needed for their primary purpose in peacetime.
    4) Since they are not needed for their primary purpose, _not_ using
       them for something useful like guarding merchants from pirates
       is wasteful.

The only question remaining is whether the number of small ships is
sufficient to do the job. You can therefor believe in one of two things:

    a) The Imperium uses less than 0.2% of its budget on small ships, or
    b) Small ships to the tune of 0.2% of the budget are too few to
       adequately defend against pirates, or 
    c) The Imperium will be able to suppress piracy.    

I believe that a navy with insufficient small ships to perform adequately
in wartime is much less likely than the absence of pirates as a career.

That\'s one way, though damn difficult to achieve since a state with a
half dozen big worlds will always be able to concentrate enough assets
to overwhelm any single big world. A much better way is to be able to
retaliate. In practice it will turn out to be a combination of the two.

>not existing in some impotent configuration.  Like being

Small ships are useless against battleships. The small ships exists.

I don\'t use any kind of analysis at all, except to look at the canonical
budget figures and see what the Imperium can get for that budget. The
equivalent in the NYC analogy would be to tell me just how many police
NYC actually does employ. And if that turns out to be about 1000 per
shift per precint, only 99% of them never leaves the precint house,
then you\'d have something approaching a parallel with the situation in
the Imperium.

My point is that they don\'t do it on that basis at all. They don\'t sit
around carefully weighing the cost of crime against the cost of law
enforcement. They take a budget and parcel it out according to
percieved need, which is often a far cry from actual need (Otherwise
traffic control here in Denmark would be a lot stricter and hospital
bills for accident victims a lot smaller).

I\'m not assuming, there is a library data entry to that effect in _Imperial
Encyclopedia_. But the main point is that with the assets the Imperium
have, _not_ deploying them against pirates is the wasteful option.

You can\'t be serious! A pirate who has captured a ship is per definition
expecting to get away with it. You think a pirate is willing to risk
capturing a cargo, but not willing to run a slightly higher risk in order
to gain many times as much? Especially since the higher risk will be to
future pirate operations, and if he takes the ship he can propably
retire in comfort. Ridiculous!

You\'re also assuming that small ships will be useful at those places, which

Less than 0.2% of the budget? That\'s not a lot.

Well, I think you could do it with 8 per world, and I doubt you\'d get an

now.

Sorry, got to run. I\'ll be back later.

Well, it seems that from tonite\'s episode the dying character won\'t be

Pretty much. Except that you are more likely to use steering jets to
re-orient your ship\'s main drive and use it to both kill the old vector
and add the new one.

For example if it took 10 minutes for the main drive to get you heading
"north" at 1000km/h and you now want to go "east" at the same speed,
you could turn the ship to point south, and run the main drive for 10
minutes (at which point you\'d be stopped) then turn the ship to point
east and fire the drive for another 10 minutes. Or you could have
turned the ship to point southeast and fired the drive for 20 minutes.

Remember, while a small (or even large) plane crashing is messy, even a
*small* starship crashing under power is more like a small *war*. We
are talking about the equivalent of a nuclear bomb or medium sized
meteor strike. That\'s going to make people rather more concerned about
what ships are doing and where they are going.

I\'d expect that you are required to have your "instantaneous vector"
(ie the vector or course you\'d follow if you cut power at any given
instant) always pointing in a "safe" direction except on final
approach.

Don\'t forget that gas giants are essentialy "hydrogen and helium, plus
minor impurities". The ammonia and methane content *especially* at the
upper levels of the atmosphere are quite low.

Well, actually, we tend to figure that you are using H1 and it\'s the
deuterium and tritium you don\'t want (for much the same reason that you
don\'t want to get any gasoline mixed with the fuel for your diesel engine).

I\'d say so.

Well, it helps to remember that LHyd is extremely *un*-dense compared
with things like water, ammonia and methane.

So for the folks that want to fill the tanks with water or whatever,
you get *more* hydrogen into the tank with any of those than you do
with LHyd. It\'s just a lot *heavier*. 

My problem with this is that tanks and equipment designed for handling
LH2 won\'t like being exposed to water, methane or ammonia. And getting
all of the traces of the stuff out beforeputting hydrogen into the
tanks is a royal pain. You can\'t just simply "partition" the tanks with
some sort of movable barrier, as hydrogen boils well below the temp
that all three freeze solid!

Huh?  Does SSDS really rate things this way?  6g12 should mean 6
gmax per turn, 12gs worth of delta v (2 turns at 6g, 6 turns at 2g,
12 turns at 1g and so on).

Doug, I\'m not surprised to find you still slinging mud.  Mr. Boulton

from others there (mine was cross-posted for convenience) about his
"Bad Form".  Personally, If I were Boulton, I\'d not respond either.
I chose to not directly chastize Andrew because a) others did already,
and b) he asked me some direct questions which took so _little_ time

I\'ll explain my tagline for this post and the Subject: line.

The Traveller Maligning List (TML) is what I call the subset of the
Traveller Mailing List (TML).  It is the list within the list, that nobody

If anybody wants examples, Doug and Harold have provided them (as of this

Perhaps, given what I\'ve seen, it should be Traveller Player/Referee

I guess I shouldn\'t have encouraged you to pine for my responses by
posting an actual follow-up to my other one.  You really shouldn\'t *live*

many naval ships there are in the Imperium!!!" It helps my view of the

I understand that there is an absolute lower end to an orbit for a

coud be anything above n (n being the lower limit in time)? I don\'t know

<BEGIN SUPER-RANT MODE>

I\'m not saying one should totally throw away the \'canon\' sources which quote
the % GWP spent on the navy, etc., but I think any future *human-based*
space empire will suffer exactly the same problems that any government
suffers now, here on Earth. To take no country in particular as an example,
why don\'t we have enough police solving crimes, cracking down on cars with
no tax disks, detecting stolen cars by radio tracking systems fitted to
every engine block, etc., etc., etc.? It\'s not because there isn\'t enough
money in the system, it\'s because 99% of the money is spent inefficiently. A
lot of money gets spent on the government themselves who, after all, have to
live in posh houses, run things from grandious buildings, and attend regular
drinks receptions at foreign embassies. Then there\'s all the administration
who have to work out how to spend the money they\'ve got. Then there are all
the committees (we like to call them quangos - basically an excuse to sound
important and run up huge expense accounts while making sure that your
personal friends get government contracts...) between the top administrators
and the actual cops on the street. Then there\'s all the costs and time
involved in all the paperwork, the general laziness of certain human
individuals, the "I don\'t want to go after this criminal because he might
actually shoot me", and the wedgeloads of cash shovelled into the gaping
wallets of the law system in order to take cases to court and then acquit
the defendants because some police officer mispronounced their rights when
arresting them.

(Ok, so I\'m taking things to extremes here!) :-)

Take a look at the world around us, and then see whether there is any real
common sense to saying X % naval budget buys Y ships which is guaranteed to
stop piracy because it can cover Z cubic kilometres of space.

GET REAL! :-)

And how important is piracy to the average citizen? I think it can be viewed
as a combination of perceived direct importance ("I\'m going on this merchant
ship, let\'s hope it doesn\'t get attacked") and manipulated media importance
("Shock Horror Front Page News: Pirate Strikes At Heart of Imperium; Emperor
Called to Task in Senate!"). Right, now think GOLDFISH. That\'s right, about
10 seconds of memory - that\'s how long these problems remain relevant to
your average citizen.

So how likely do you think it is that, upon hearing of an outbreak of
piracy, the citizens will stomp up even an extra 0.1% of taxes to alleviate
the problem? ZERO PERCENT CHANCE. The navy will complain that they are
overburdened with customs duties and lack of maintenance on their ships
(they have enough ships really, but it seems like a good ploy to divert some
of next year\'s budget away from their direct competition, i.e. the army).
The government will say that it\'s a very serious matter and that they will
immediately set up a committee to decide upon the best date, and
representation for a committee to look into the food which ought to be
served to a committee looking into the possibility that the pirate attacks
are racially motivated. i.e. they will blither, in the hopes that things
will blow over, as there\'s an election coming up and they can\'t raise taxes
(and they are most certainly not going to redirect taxes from something
worthwhile like their own bloated 76 course lunches).

At the end of the day, the navy get told to buck their ideas up, 45MCr have
been spent on additional committees, and some bright spark has decided that
to make up for this they\'ll mount an efficiency drive by reducing the crew
of each SDB by half... (sold to higher authority with phrases such as "think
of the long-term savings for the government with regard to pension
contributions", etc...)

As you may tell, it\'s been a long Friday afternoon, so I\'m rambling. Anyway,
you should have got my gist by now. In the same way that a class A starport
can be a huge inefficient wasteful dump of a place, and a class D can be an
efficient (if small) and friendly operation that people actually *like* to
visit... oops, rambling again. Must be those few pints I had at lunchtime.

I\'ll try for a concise summary.

Look at the real world.

Forget mystical calculations of GNP et al.

Why?

Because most of the space that Travellers adventure in is run by *humans*.

i.e.

If pirates *want* to exist, there are guaranteed to be enough corrupt, inept
and incompetent individuals/navies/governments/worlds for them to survive.

Andy :-)

P.S. If you have any doubt whatsoever about the discussion above, watch a
few re-runs of the Yes Minister or Yes PrimeMinister series from the UK, and
remind yourself that this is mild in comparison to the real incompetence of
most politicians. For example, when the UK entered the ERM and the pound
crashed earlier this decade, were the key government ministers (who were
authorising the billions of expenditure to prop up the currency) watching
complicated computers analysing every movement on the money markets? Did
they at least have well-informed advisors who were directly in touch with
the markets? No, they were listening in to the reports from COMMERCIAL RADIO
STATIONS. Shouldn\'t the UK population have immediately come to their senses
and planted a pile of gunpowder under the Houses of Parliament? Of course
not, since this was reported on a TV program, and by the time the average
citizen had worked out anything should be done, they\'d forgotten why, or who
to (q.v. goldfish memory quote above), and by the way wasn\'t it time for the
next soap show...

Unlikely. The costs per TL for PE were calculated using back-of-the-envelope
maths from a few SSDS/QSDS designs, compared arbitrarily with the cost of
personal weaponry at various tech levels, modified for training of human
resources (sorry, I mean troops, etc.) and multiplied by the fourth root of

one of the biggest problem for illegal acts in space is that at
moderately high TLs sensors can pick out any kind of activity at
enormous distances.

This invalidates most of the would-be pirate tactics, and makes
their work extremely difficult and much too risky to be a viable
career.

In one of his postings, Hans Racke basically told that until
Marc Miller okays some kind of cloaking device, Pirates will
have no chance of surviving.

Bruce Alan Macintosh (IIRC) also suggested that younger system
would have high concentrations of space dust which would
effectively diminish sensor effectiveness.

What I\' currently considering is some sort of substance which
could be used by a starship in order to mask its position. I
envision the stuff as a kind black powder which may be put in
the same canisters of the classical sandcaster and used as a
localized cloud of particles which would hide the craft inside.

The stuff (DarkSand?) may be as costly and illegal as you see
fit, obviously, and could be produced at different TLs with
different masking potencies.

In order not to disrupt canon too much, I\'d propose that this
tactic is effective only for smaller craft (i.e. up to Corsair
class, but no more) and that in order to remain hidden a ship
must cut off his M-drives and avoid using radio or active
sensors.

BTW, I\'d say that a ship who wants to hide in this way should
use a detached sensor module, parked outside the cloud and which
relays passive sensors data back to the mother ship through some
form of dedicated, short range and low energy system (a cable?).

The masking effect would not be total, but strong enough to
force people to come much closer in order to discover if the
"black patch" on their screens is really empty, contains only
inert debris (like real space dust) or does in fact hide some
threat.

As presented, it would be mostly useless for large fleet
engagement (thus preserving canon on large battles), but it
could give some chance to pirates, covert ops raids, and so on.

So, what do you think of this idea?  Is it viable, "realistic",
and can it be used without disrupting canonical space tactics
too much?

If someone wants to discuss this on the list, please be patient:
I read digests only, so my answer will come a little later.

We have a small tradition in the Berry household.  At the end of most B5

couldn\'t.  Kirsten was crying to hard.  This is amazingly good storytelling.

OK. So were agreed that Worlds, in general, have their own Navy. This is
good, because for a while there I got the impression that you assumed
the whole portion of a planet\'s military budget was siphoned off to the
Imperium and distributed as the Imperium wishes. This is something I
completely disagree with. Every world of POP 6+ and Starport B+ will
have a portion of its military budget dedicated to a local navy.

So, assuming that even modestly populated planets have a Planetary Navy,
you contend that there will still be "hit and run" attacks by pirates.

And in another part of your post you say that one or two scouts per
system would be enough to track enemy ship movements.

Sooooo... why can\'t they track pirates? How could there be "hit and run"
attacks if the local Navy can track movements of spaceships?

The pirates pose as merchants, you say, and then sneak up on some
unsuspecting merchie and pounce. This seems to me to be the only
possibly defendable scenario you propose. (Besides government or
corporate sponsored pirates, which I have no difficulty in accepting)
Even so, I have a problem with independant pirates posing as merchants
for three reasons:

(1) In order for the pirate to *not* draw attention to itself, it must
be similarily armed as a "typical" merchant. Therefore, the probability
of success in battle is not overly high. I think the risk for such a
battle is too high to be profitable in the long run.

(2) Merchants will be found in two areas: a) within the 100 dia. limit
of the system\'s starport. b) between planets within the system, for
systems with any significant interplanetary trade. I contend that area
a) is easy to defend, a handful of SDBs will do the job, and piracy will
be non-existant. I will concede the point that area b) is less easy to
defend, but not overly so, as the optimum course between two planets is
well known and likely to be patrolled; but by definition these areas
will be less profitable (less trade).

(3) Space battle as defined in Traveller is quite a long process. It
takes several hours, at least. And even if the battle is won by the
pirate I suspect the time it would take to seize the cargo or the ship
would be non-trivial. I would think in the vast majority of systems, the
time it would take for a distress signal sent by the victim after the
first shot was fired to reach a local SDB or its equivialent would be
quite enough for the said local Navy vessel to respond and rescue the
hapless individual.

And don\'t tell me the pirate would just seize my ship and jump out with
it! The second *I\'m* disabled, I\'m dumping fuel! Hah! Take my ship now!
phhhhttt...

So it is my opinion, that in the Traveller Universe I know (that\'s
published), piracy in civilized areas (def: areas with significant
trade) by lone individuals or groups of individuals without corporate or
governmental sponsorship would be (virtually) non-existant.

In TNE wilds areas, piracy would be quite rampant. I wouldn\'t feel safe
in the Vargr extents in any milieu. And times of war would always have
government sponsored privateer/pirate strikes (which is why the marches
were Amber Zoned during the Fifth Frontier War)

There is opportunity for piracy in Traveller. 

BUT Piracy does *not* ALWAYS exist.

Really?  All I did was respond to you point by point.  Including where you
get insulting.  I notice that you have chosen to ignore our points about
Emperor\'s Vehicles and gone directly to the personal attacks.

Somebody did a count of posts by various authors on the TML a few months
back, and I seem to be one of the top five posters.  Somehow, I manage to
get along with everybody *except* you.  Even those I disagree with.  I
wonder why? 

Could it be that no one else on this list engages in the kind of "I\'m
right, worship me" attitude that you inflict on us?  Perhaps we\'re sick of
your constant name-dropping?  Maybe the majority of us think that you\'re
wrong, and are tired of your attacks on those who disagree with you?

No, that is the definition of the original \'modular\' design.  USL ships

Two other numbers might be useful to compare ->

In Traveller, the Navy is the lion\'s share of the military might, whereas
here, it is split between AF, Marines, Navy, and Army.  All of these will
exist in Traveller too, for the same reasons they exist here, but the Navy
does get a bigger share.

What is the total military budget in Traveller by TCS, and the total
military budget here?

The second number deals with the value of a credit.  I am using 1CR=$3, as
that seems to make the PCGNP numbers work out - it seems that the expenses
in the rulebook indicate ~10KCr/yr, while the PCGNP here is closer to $30K,
if I remember the Economic Report of the President correctly.

Given the larger share the Navy should get of the budget, this matches
pretty well.

Once again, the real world is different from Traveller.  Possibly in ways
that should be altered, but different none the less.

In the Real World (TM), the weapons and support needed for a ship to be
able to  fight are very, very expensive, compared to the cost of an unarmed
ship.  Thus, our merchants and our pickets have essentially no firepower.
I believe current doctrine, though, is using PTs as pickets, which can
flatten any unarmed or lightly armed civilian ship fairly easily.

(This gives merchants the tools with which to commit piracy, but it also
means warships are far more common w.r.t the merchies than today.)

A pirate in the RW taking on a PT boat is usually a dead pirate, which, I
think, enhances the point that piracy in our world must take place either
with government sanction, or in places the governments choose not to
patrol.  Given the expense of weaponsry, a picket with a radio is good
enough in the RW, as long as it can get away from Bad Guys.

In Traveller, for whatever reason, the ancillary systems needed to make it
a starship are very, very expensive, and are of similar magnitude to the
cost of a decent sensor/weapons suite.  Further, the sensor suite is part
of what it will take for those pickets to do their job.  This is very, very
different from our world, in which one decent sized gun and combat radar
can cost as much as a merchant vessel.

As a result, there is not much difference in cost (in Traveller) between
small pickets, and armed small pickets, such that if it does not harm the
mission, and increases the odds of survival, it is likely that they will be
armed, just so they have a chance of getting away with the information you
want them to have.  Using a picket to solve a minor problem is cheaper all
around than having to have a minimum two week turnaround while the picket
reports back to someone with real guns.  Further, f the picket has a
reasonable chance of escaping a bad situation, you might get a report form
it.  Both of these encourage pickets having reasonable armaments.

Nothing saves a PT in front of the Missouri, but having those torpedos
makes other ships at least consider their actions.

By the canonical standards of the Traveller universe, and the 90kt-500kt
battleships, a Kinunir _is_ a picket.  It sure as hell cannot stand up to a
serious warship for long.  Further, only other dedicated warships are going
to be able to easily defeat ships like it.

IMHO, the Navy will likely encourage worlds to have outposts of the
requisite number of defending SBDs that they will patrol near space
aggressively.  A much smaller and cheaper SDB can stand up to a Kinunir,
because they do not need the J4 drives needed to stay with the fleet, so
any world with a permanent outpost acts as an advance warning system not
paid for by the Imperial budget.  The world can keep an eye on near space,
and thus the Navy needs a smaller number of courier craft in order to
consider that system secure.

Note: secure in this context means that they will get a warning if
something bad happens.

I semi-agree with the above poster. Why is there piracy in the real-world(tm)?
They arguments put forth on spending money on Navy to get rid of them would
be applicable here as well - right?

As for Traveller, my Pirates always operate from bases either ouside the
Imperium (District 268 of Spinward marches for instance) or on rogue
planets that somebody happens upon when misjumping (there should be lots of
rogue planets drifting in deep space that got thrown out from its star
after a close passage with another star. My system gives exits from
misjumps a higher propability near planetary/star masses.

Well, I\'ve taken the liberty of breaking out the "How big is the typical
planetary navy?" and "Where are warship\'s stationed?" bit. I think
that\'s an important variable, and my interpretation of planetary navies
causes me to lean towards the conclusion that, in general, piracy by
individuals without support of a large government or corporation has a
very low probability of success.

This isn\'t to say that there aren\'t crazies out there who would try, but
it seems to me there are safer methods of gaining financial security
dishonestly.

Shadow\'s broken out the "Air Traffic control makes it hard to sneak up
on people" part of the argument. There\'s others, Scott et al, who have
taken up the "How much money goes into military budgets and how much is
justified to defend against piracy?" part. Hans and David seem to be the
main combatants in the general debate. Then there\'s other milquetoasts
who say "It\'s always possible, it\'s the Ref\'s decision, man!" which
while true, isn\'t condusive to an entertaining flamefest ---- er, debate,
I mean. :)

Actually Leroy, Doug was pointing out *your* "Bad Form" because it
appeared that you posted a response on the TML to a private email from
Andrew, which is indeed rude, imho.

Instead, you say that you cross-posted a response from HIWG to the TML.
This is just as grievous a breach of netiquette, imho. This isn\'t
USENET, this is a mailing list. While I feel it is perfectly fine to
_start_ a thread on both lists by cross-posting, it is *not* good form
to respond to a thread only present on one list by cross-posting to
another. It leaves people out of the discussion, and we don\'t have full
disclosure of the thread.

I don\'t see this as mudslinging. Those who are rude should be held
accountable.

Actually, I found Doug and Harold\'s responses to be quite good at
pointing out the flaws in the book, and why they do not agree with your

have the right to be heard, and they were quite specific in taking on
reasons why the book is unacceptable *to them*.

I think I understand why others seem so hostile toward you, when you
continue to post things in a condescending tone and more "Traveller than
thou" attitude.

I do not like to see the mailing list erupt in flames, but I do believe
in everyone\'s right to state their (traveller-related) opinions. Those
who are rude and flame should be held accountable. A blanket statement
that there is a "maligning" faction who exist merely to cut people down
is unacceptable.

"Pretty obvious" doesn\'t cut it. The statistics should list this
information. All previous incarnations of Traveller have made this
information available. Why doesn\'t this one? A grievous oversight.

It\'s "pretty obvious" that a plasma gun will do more than collateral
damage, too, but we don\'t just take this on good faith. We need the stats
to show us this information, so we can know how much *more* damage plasma
gun A can do than laser cannon B. Otherwise the book is useless.

Any referee can just arbitrarily *say* what a vehicle can or cannot do.
There\'s no use to making a book that publishes apparently arbitrary
information when an independent referee could do the same by himself.

If you consider this hypothetical statement a valid answer, you\'ve got a
few screws loose.

Uh, how about FFS2, the one that was purportedly used to generate these
vehicles? Again, what\'s the point of publishing such a book if you don\'t do
it using the underlying mechanics of your game?

Show users that you have created these using game mechanics and they are
likely to purchase the design system and develop an appreciation for it.
Give them incomplete stats and they\'re likely to scoff. RPGers are
generally a discriminating and critical lot. It\'s a testament to a good
game when the published vehicles are usable.

Do you like spinning your wheels in the sand? Because that\'s essentially
what you\'re doing with this tripe you\'re spitting out. Let me translate
that statement for the non-impaired: "The beauty of the game is that it
doesn\'t work properly."

Again, *mostly* doesn\'t cut it. Refs need to know this information if they
intend to run a realistic campaign. Running out of gas could be a major
plot element. For the ref to just arbitrarily say, "You just ran out of
gas," he\'s building his campaign on artificial limitations. To actually
*know* how much fuel the vehicle carries, how far away from the destination
the players are, and how much fuel the vehicle consumes over time, makes
the scenario genuine.

This doesn\'t mean that a pocket calculator becomes the ref\'s best friend.
But it allows refs to make a realistic approximation of what events might
occur and adds depth to the roleplaying session.

He\'s not asking for "every" answer. He\'s asking for the answers he
deserves. Any Traveller player might as well just pull the vehicles out of
thin air rather than buy this book.

What he\'s arguing is whether or not this is a useful product. By taking a
critical eye to it, he has recognized that there are some critical flaws
with EV. For you to argue otherwise is just an example of your reliance on
sophistry to make your point when in truth, you have no valid point other
than some unquenchable desire to suck up to IG at every opportunity.

I\'m beginning to think that if IG slapped a Traveller logo on a pile of cow
manure and called it a product, you would sing its praises.

It\'s not a TNE thing. MT had a good design sequence as well. Or do you
remember that far back? The basic problem here is that IG did not build its
designs on one set of underlying principles that were created as the
foundation of the game. The design sequences are afterthoughts. And it
shows.

Your opinion.

If the vehicles in the book were designed with a proper design sequence,
the product could be appreciated on two levels: 1) by those more concerned
with roleplaying *only* who don\'t much care whether or not the mechanics
work, and 2) by those who believe a consistent and fairly realistic set of
mechanics is a vital part of roleplaying.

All it would have taken is some more effort by the publishers. Previous
publishers of Traveller have gone to this level of detail so there\'s really
no excuse for why the current game does not.

I, and one or two others, have been pondering how long it takes a ship
to orbit a planet.

Then, some kind person on the TML reminded me that there are rules for
this (at least partially) in the SOM.

Traveller is such a huge game--20 years, 4 editions.  It\'s no wonder
that rules get lost, and contradicted, here and there.  I forgot these
rules were there.

The rule in the SOM addresses three types of orbits for Traveller craft:
Standard Orbit, High Orbit, and Geosync Oribt.  It solves our problems. 
See below the definitions for how it works.



STANDARD ORBIT
Standard Orbit:  Most common type of orbit uses;  also called low orbit.



HIGH ORBIT
High Orbit:  A much higher oribt, not used as often as standard orbit.



GEOSYNC ORBIT
Geosync Orbit:  A very high orbit that allows the ship to remain
stationary over a given location on the rotating world.



STANDARD/HIGH ORIBT TABLE
Here\'s how the SOM does standard and high orbits...

World Size      Std O.      High O.
- ----      ----      ----
0               5           25
1               20          100
2               40          200

3               60          300
4               80          400
5               100         500

6               120         600
7               140         700
8               160         800

9               180         900
A               200         1,000
Sm GG           800         4,000

Lg GG           1,600       8,000



USING THE TABLE--STEP ONE
Finding orbit height from the surface of the world is a two step
process.  Step one is to simply look on the chart to see how many more
kilometers (from the world\'s surface) the ship is orbiting at.  For
example, a ship in standard orbit, orbiting a size 4 planet, will be 80
KM out.  Step one only accounts for world\'s with no atmosphere (thus the
close orbit distances).



USING THE TABLE--STEP TWO
Step two is to add in distance based on the world\'s atmosphere.  If a
world has a UWP atmosphere code of 2+, you continue with step two.  If
the world has an atmos code of 1-, you use the numbers in the chart
straight.

Step two is simple (if you use this step)--just multiply the atmosphere
code by the amount in the table.  This will give you oribiting
distance.  For example, a ship is orbiting a planet in high orbit over a
size 5 planet with an atmosphere code of 6.  This means the ship is
orbiting at 3,000 KM (6 x 500).



GEOSYNC ORIBT
Now, for geosync orbit...

To figure geosync orbit, you use this formula.

O = 5078 x [(m x p^2)^.33] - (D / 2)

where:  O = geosync orbit in km
        p = rotation period of world in hours
        m = mass of world
        D = diameter of world in km



FIGURING A SHIP\'S ORBITAL DISTANCE AND ORBITAL TIME
So, to figure out how far out your craft is (or an enemy craft), simply
use one of these three systems, depending on which orbit (standard,
high, or geosync) you are trying to find.

This is a quickie that any GM can use in a pinch.

Finding the actual time it takes to orbit a world takes a little more
calculaton though.

Once you know the distance to orbit, you can simply add the planet\'s
diameter to this number to figure the size of the sphere the ship is
rotating about.  Using that, you can figure the circle\'s circumfrence. 
This will give you a linear distance the ship is travelling.

At this point, you simply need to decide how fast the ship is moving. 
Given the speed at which starships move, you can really have the ship
moving as fast as you like (geosync orbits, of course, will rotate at
the same rate as the planet\'s rotation--the local day).

As a GM, you may say that the starport has rules for orbits.  For
instance, there might be a rule, for saftey reasons, that ships cannot
move faster than the planet\'s rotations, effectively limiting ships
orbiting the planet to the local day.

Or, there may be no restrictions, and a ship can zoom around the planet
in a few minutes (think of how fast ships move in starship combat with
one hex being 30,000 KM).

Again, the speed is up to the GM (thus making the rotation period for a
ship in orbit also up to the GM), but these SOM rules can give you some
hard, quick guidlines to go on--especially since they can tell you how
far out the ship is orbiting.

If I haven\'t made all of this clear and easy to understand (I don\'t feel
I\'ve done the best job at that), ask a question and we\'ll tackle it.



EXAMPLE OF ORBITAL DISTANCE AND ORBITAL TIME
I\'ll leave you with an example from my game (which is why I asked this
question in the first place).

Pysadi
Size = 4 
(specific diameter is 6,560 KM, which I figured out when I detailed the
place)

Atm = 7

Ship is in standard orbit.

Starport regulations restrict orbit speed to 1,000 KM per minute.


Using my chart, I see that the ship is orbiting at 980 KM from the
suface of Pysadi (that\'s 7 x 140).

I\'ve arbitrarily decided that the starport restricts orbit speed, for
all ships, to 1,000 KM per minute.

The formula for finding the circumfrence of a circle is (2 x 3.1416 x
radius).

So, now I know that the ship will pass overhead (orbit the planet) once
every 26.7 minutes.

Follow the math.  Pysadi\'s radius is 3280 km (6560 / 2).

Add in orbit height to find radius of orbit.  3280 + 980 = 4260 km

Now, plug in numbers to circumfrence formula.  2 x 3.1416 x 4260 =
26,766 km.

The linear distance of the orbit is 26,766 km (almost the size of one
space combat hex).  Since I\'ve decided that the ship cannot go faster
than 1,000 km per minute (legally), it will take the ship about 27
minutes to complete its orbit (if it is moving at max speed).



SUMMARY
The orbit distance can be found on the fly by simply looking on the
chart and making one multiplaction.

Time for a ship to complete an orbit is a little more complicated, but
nothing an astute GM cannot figure without holding up the game too
much--just figure the radius of the orbit and plug the numbers into the
circumfrence formula.

Clauswitz and others pushed the concept of the schwerpunkt or "centre of =

gravity" in the enemy.  This can be many things but essesntially it is a
target
that will cause the surrender of the enemy if it is achieved.

Possible Schwerpunkts are (nte there can be combinations of =

schwerpunkt and an enemy can have several):

(i)  Industrial capacity

Here the enemy is determined to only be able to carry on the war as long =
as

it maintains a certain degree of its industrial capacity.  This is a comm=
on
schwerpunkt in small pocket empires with one or two highpopulation =

worlds that supply the military and economic strength of the entire empir=
e.

By estroying or capturing these, you ensure that the rest of the empire i=
s =

brought to speedy surrender.  Large political bodies with many such centr=
es

of industry take a massive effort to bring low given the intrinsic
defensive =

capability of most high population worlds.

(ii) Morale

their morale so brittle that a decisive battle will turn them against the=

Such situations occur when an aggressor finds the war too costly to puris=

and they rapidly grow tired of its continuance.  Terror is also a factor

to war and can be effective in forcing a foe to terms.  However, it can

be effective in hardening resistance or the desire to win.  Careful =

understanding of the enemies psyche is required for this approach.

(iii). Defensive forces

The enemies capacity to wage war is guaged by the strength of their force=

the short term - as the war progresses then industrial capacity becomes
vital =

but at the initial stages it is the forces capable of fighting initially
and short term reserves that must bear the brunt.  If these forces can be=

In many cases, rather than face occupation of significant parts of their

A double envelopment of what?  If you cut off a sector then it still

Any strategy which invites defeat in detail is grossly incompetant and should 
only be undertaken with full awareness of the risks.   Because the enemy is
operating on interior lines they have the capability of hurling their
weight against either one split force or the other to defeat both in detail
- - the classic example 
being the Waterloo campaign where the French, outnumbered 2:1 by the
allies, achieved local superiority on each battlefield and almost won both
(except they failed to keep the other flank from joining up).
The reason why pincer attacks worked in land warfare is because the speed=
of the attack combined with the severance of communications led to the
rapid impotence of the surrounded forces - this is simply not possible in space with =
the jump drive.  Instead Traveller warfare could be compared to island warfare =
in a vast ocean where such isolation is expected and relatively easy to cope 
with but also difficult to do something about.  If a high population world has 
6,000 SDBs and 4billion ground troops then its not going to be easy to take
but its offensive power is 0.  Bypass it and defeat their forces elsewhere
and the rest will follow.

Given the slow speed of any advance in Traveller, the prediction of an enemy 
thrust is relatively easy.  Rather than split his forces, Martin I should
have used 
their overwhelming strength to full effect and concentrated them in an
attempt 
to bring the enemy fleet to battle - this he could have achieved by moving
steadily from target to target, takin world after world and _forcing the
Julian Star Legion to engage or lose the very planets they were supposed to
be protecting.  His supply lines would be _more_ solid as he could
concentrate more resources to their protection than he could for the
preposterous double envelopment.

Fleet strength would not be "nibbled away" if he practiced economy and

You quote Moreau, another turnip-head who used complexity instead of
action.  Martin I\'s double envelopment was no knock-out blow.  From what
I\'ve read it =

What? What??

Leroy, someday I can just not believe my eyes. I certainly
don\'t think Doug was "slinging mud" and I think that most participants 
of this mailing lost would agree. He may have made a mistake,
perhaps he didn\'t realize Andrew\'s message was cross-posted. I think
it\'s a lot more of an attack to accuse someone of "slinging mud"
than to accuse someone of "bad form". The absolute hypocrisy of it.

You are as guilty of maligning people on this list as anyone is.

As the risk of becoming a malinger myself, I often find the tone 
in your messages to be pedantic and patronizing. Quite frankly,
it rubs me the wrong way sometimes and I can only imagine that 
other people feel the same way. I regard myself as being open minded
though, so I try to set aside what I perceive your tone to be when I
read your messages and I try to concentrate on the actual content 
of what you\'ve written. Perhaps you should try the same thing.

might be useful.

Improvements are welcome.  Reasonable simplifications are coveted.

Entering a System from Jump:
- ----
Int + Engineering <= 1D6 + # of months since the ship had service  (or so)
Int + Astrogation <= 3D

Two successes means the ship arrives just inside the 100-diameter
sphere around the target world.

If there are failures, the size of the failures are important.
Determine how many points each roll failed by, and multiply those
points together if both rolls failed.  This is the number of DAYS 
until the ship will arrive inside the target\'s 100-diameter 
sphere at 1G.  


Different accelerations reduce the time thus:

2G = Result * 0.7
3G = Result * 0.6
4G = Result * 0.5
5G = Result * 0.45
6G = Result * 0.4





Example:
- ----
The _Marleener_ has an Engineer-4 (Int 9) and Astrogator-1 (Int 14).
It hasn\'t had service done in 13 months.  Emerging from jump:

Engineer  : 13 <= 16,	fails by 3 points
Astrogator: 15 <= 9,    success

So the ship arrives 3 days out of the 100-diameter limit at 1G.
Travelling at 2G reduces the time to 2.1 days.




Example:
- ----
The _Deadman_ hasn\'t seen a service port for two years.  On board
is an Engineer-3 (Int 8) and Astrogator-3 (Int 11).

Engineer  : 11 <= 26, 	fails by 15 points!
Astrogator: 14 <= 16,   fails by 2 points

The product of the failures = 30 -> 30 days!  Ouch!
Since the ship can move at 3G, the time is reduced to 18 days.
Still, the _Deadman_ is out there.




Worst Case Example:
- ----
The _Glutton_ is a 1G free trader, with an Engineer-1 (Int 7),
an Astrogator-1 (Int 7), and it\'s been 6 months since it had
its yearly maintenance.  Here we go:

Engineer  : 8 <= 8, 	success
Astrogator: 8 <= 8,	success

Wow, just squeaked by.  Let\'s let 6 more months pass.  It\'s been
12 months since the _Glutton_\'s last maintenance.

Now to the disaster:

Engineer  : 8 <= 18,    fails by 10 points
Astrogator: 8 <= 18,	fails by 10 points

The product of failures = 100 days!  Big Ouch!  Woo-hoo!  Makes

While this may be true, I think the main point those on the "Piracy
doesn\'t exist (much)" side of the fence are trying to make is that:
There are easier/more profitable/less risky ways of taking advantage of
human incompetance to make a quick buck.

Piracy will be rare because the *successful* pirate will be a very rare
bird indeed.

I am both glad and somewhat dismayed to that you brought this up!

I am glad, because it gives me the chance to point out that even with the
cost per citizen being somewhat higher in the US than in the Imperium,
there are grave doubts as to whether that is sufficient to maintain our
forces, even at thier current level.

I would also love the opportunity to point out that the USCG, supplemented
by the USN, is unable to control the small boat piracy problem in the
Caribbean, much less the smuggling that goes there.  Note that this is
considered a serious problem in the local area, but it does not affect the
US security or economic health as a whole, so there is not the political
will to stamp it out.

Do you think that if the USN decided that it were necessary, and parked a
carrier battle group in the Caribbean, it would be possible to eliminate
this?  And with Mayport, Fl (A US Navy Base) right there, it would be easy
to support this BG.

However, I am dismayed that this particular example need be used, because
I, in no way, wish to demean the contribution either service makes, nor
try and villify anyone for not paying attention to a regretable, _local_
issue.

Just for the record tho, the USCG is attached to the Department of
Transportation (except in time of war), not the Department of the Navy.

As for (a), this is patently untrue. I\'m a member of the HIWG list and as a
witness to what goes on there, I can report that as usual, Leroy\'s deluded
mind has twisted the facts.

Andrew Boulton did *not* get chastized for his comments.

However, if you want to see a person get chastized over e-mail flames, join
HIWG and subscribe to the group\'s mailing list. On at least a weekly basis,
Leroy gets chastized and/or flamed for his idiotic remarks and his fawning
over IG despite the company\'s obvious problems.

The rest of the list is pretty even tempered and more rooted in reality.
Most folks on the HIWG list, many of whom are members here and on tne-rces
as well, take a more objective eye to IG\'s products. Some have good things
to say. Some have bad. But except for Leroy, no one seems to be obsessed
with kissing IG\'s collective butt.

It\'s more than just Doug and Harold. At least a dozen people on this list
have debunked your ridiculous ideas about canon and fawning remarks about
IG\'s products.

Hrm.
Neural activity scanners, to find anyone alive.
Something to check pressure on the other side of that wall.
Rescue gear, so if there _are_ survivors you can pull them to safety via your
slaplocks.
You\'ll need to analyze the structural integrity if there _is_ pressure, before
making a new hole in the wall for your airlock.

Something which can keep low berth and emergency low berth pods running while
you cut them out, bring them to your ship, and get them into a pressurized area
for your medics to check them over.

Computer equipment - you\'ll want to check it for virus bombs (if you\'re in
TNE).  Regardless, they might have good stuff in their databanks or backups.

Do you need any special equipment to salvage, say, the jump drive\'s crystals if
the ship itself isn\'t salvagable?

Something to move cargo?

What kind of ships?

This is kind of how I envision it - I would appreciate any feedback you
care to offer.

The big cargo ships (15,000 + dtons) run exclusively to the Starport B+,
Pop 7+ worlds.  They are not configured for passengers, and probably begin
offloading when they arrive in system via lighters, and are still
on-loading as they begin the run towards the jump point.

The Medium size cargo/passenger ships (5,000 - 15,000 dtons) are the bulk 
of the traffic in space. Like the tankers and freighters that ply our
oceans, 90% of all goods that travel between systems eventually end up on
one of these ships. They make the runs to the Class C Starports, and to
the smaller Class A and B starports (Pop 5+).

The Small cargo/passenger ships (1,000 - 5,000 dton) specialize in
carrying cargo and passengers to the minor markets, worlds not served by
the Mediums.

The under 1,000 dton ships pick up the leftovers.  They perform the
bulk of the intra-system commerce and serve the worlds on the fringes, or
pick up the cargos that were missed.  Some few (the Subbies) visit worlds
that the larger ships cannot make a profit at.

Now, how much traffic?  Let\'s start with some numbers, and we can argue it
from there.

(World T*Pop Code) Ktons per year.
x2 if the world is AG or is Ri
x3 if the world has a military base or is a Capital
x4 if the world is Ind

This would have Mora (TL 15, Pop 10) with 150 Ktons of cargo traffic (not
ships, amount of cargo available to be imported/exported) per month.  It
would also have Fenl\'s Gren (TL 9, Pop 3) with 2,250 tons per month.

How does it sound?  Anyone with a better idea?

OTOH, it just isn\'t that big a ship.  I don\'t have my Traveller
stuff in from of my, but it only has two turrets and can
only bring one to bear on a single target at a time.  (And
that one is take out in a the first shot).

Um no.  This economic would only apply if it guaranteed that
you are imune to piracy.  Otherwise, you have to note that
a Maser Comm only has a chance of saving you if surrender
and hope there is a ship that can get there in time to
save at least a portion of your cargo.

If you are looking at a 50 year investment, you
are talking 4,000 Cr/year.  This would reasonable if
your odds of being pirated were reduced 25% and piracy
took something 1-2% of the commercial cargos a year
(which is a significant crime rate, but not high
enough to be a major problem).

Well, you don\'t know if there is a danger of piracy before
you get there.

This gives me an idea. Given that the Imperium is very capitalistic,
there are probably corporations which offer naval services to systems
for a fee. So:

SecureGuard, LIC, is pleased to offer _insert system name here_
naval services! For a reasonable yearly fee, SecureGuard will
provide protection from pirates, customs inspections of ships
selected at random and emergency rescue services. In the event of
a full scale invasion, we\'ll even hold the fort (so to speak) until
the Imperial Navy arrives.

If SecureGuard has the contract, there will be a set number of 
permissible pirate attacks. Eliminating pirate attacks altogether will
be much more expensive than allowing, say, two per year. All this will
be spelled out in the contract.

Well, the cheaper SecureGuard service contract will guarantee a
much poorer response time than the more expensive ones. So, it is
possible.

Also, to drum up business, SecureGuard may actually illegally stage
some pirate attacks, in order to sweeten the negotiating process!

Sort of.
When a biped walks, it uses an inverted pendulum gait.  This involves going up
on one leg, falling forward on that leg, putting your other leg stiffly in
front of you, catching yourself on the next leg, and using your momentum to go
up on that new leg.  Thus, when you\'re highest in the air you are going
slowest, and when your body is lowest you are going fastest.  Potential energy
goes to kinetic energy and back to potential energy.
Your legs are acting like the spokes of a rimless wheel.
Of course an animal smooths this out, bends a little at the knees, and so on,
but that\'s basically what is going on.

Gravity\'s role is to keep you from becoming airborne when you\'re transferring
your kinetic energy to potential energy, so as gravity\'s accelleration
increases you can go faster without bouncing into the air.

It\'s a pretty poorly phrased question, and the answer isn\'t quite what you
expect.

If you want the fastest speed, run.  Running involves bouncing on your legs as
though they were springs.  And, here, lower gravity is better provided you can
keep control.  Your top speed depends on how well you can replace losses, and
how good your control is.  But just like a wheel, you don\'t spend a lot of
energy keeping yourself in the air.  That energy is stored and returned in
springs (tendons) at each step.

   What is sad is that you decry the tone of this list, while on the

such a free fire zone, I left permanently.  I\'d take everything to

   Note Leroy says nothing about my specific points, only generalizes
about the tone of our (Doug and I) posts.  Do you care to address the
fact that CT books listed TL and crew requirements of vehicles, and EV
does not, or would you rather just concede?

P.S. To everyone else on this list: My apologies if any of you are
offended by my posts here in response to Leroy.  Leroy and his friend
J.P. waged a war against me (and others) on HIWG-list, one they refused
to take to private e-mail.  The attacks got so bad, I consulted an
attorney about a possible libel suit.  To say I hold a grudge is to put
it mildly.  Leroy would of course tell the story differently, and would
undoubtedly try to twist things to make it appeared that I was
responsible.  That would of course be a lie.  For Leroy to lecture
anyone about the tone of any e-mail is laughable, and as I said above,
sad at best.  Thank you for your patience.

of the average.

I\'m not.  I never refered to encounter tables to establish

Hans, the is good place to stop because this is not what I
am saying and anyplace someone starts attacking how you are
depebating and trying to make claims about what the other
person is saying, the bebate is over.  The point it that
a problem to stop pirates has to be able to stop all kinds
of pirates operating all mode, not that all pirates have
to be several things at once....

[As to tiresome, you didn\'t have to rivive it from the Gas

Well, except it is the idea that those ships are there for
military purposes anyway is what you keep citing.  If the
the concern for war is that low, then the military fleets
aren\'t going to be sitting around to be diverted to piracy.
If the concern is high enough about war to build and deploy
those ships, then they will want them to used for that purpose.

Having dozens of ships in ever system is way more than what
you need to escort convoys of ships.  Or, to put it another
way, since ships are concentrated into convoys in war time
but not in peace, the number of ships need to guard them
in war is less than in peace.

Also, a lot of these ships are moblized out of reserves (like
the Scout ships) so you  don\'t have to keep paying for them
during peace.  If you use them for piracy, then you have to
justify the cost.

>>You aren\'t going to be sending small forces out to seek out battle because

This isn\'t seeking battle.  Those raiding squadrons will be
trying to avoid encounters because there is such a good chance
they will get squashed.

Because if you spread all your ships over every world in
every system, then 98% of them will unvailable for
every battle and you have the enemy picking them off
one small bit at a time.

Fighting a war is cold blooded business.  If you look at
history, most people do what they need to win the war while
those who don\'t loose (Miller understood this when he
had the Solomani pay a price for defending every single
system).  The enemy is not likely to bother these places
for the same reason they are not worth defending.  In
all wars you have places with not strategic value that
never see a single battle unless the main armies
happen to be passing through.

>Or are you just assuming it in order

OK Hans, more and more, you have started to splip in attacks
on my honesty and motivations.   I understand that you feel
strongly about your view, but that is not justifacation.  I
am stopping here before it gets worse.

personal attacks. And very petty ones too. 

I realize that most people will never even read this post, or care. But I
like to have ideas stimulated, concepts proposed and designs posted. I
really do not want to see personal volleys. Please, take it elsewhere or
stop it (latter preferred) for the sake of peace on the list. And for the
sake of interesting discussion. 

Relating this to Traveller....sorry, I cannot. Except as maybe an example of
why long-distance government would have a lot of trouble governing
effectively

I don\'t have my Traveller stuff in from of my, either ;-) but i seem to
remember that the standard SDB is 400 tons and has *four* turrets. Since
it has no jump drives, It can afford larger maneuver and power plant.

As for how many turrets it can bring to bear, that depends upon the
edition of Traveller. In TNE its larger Power Plant means it can install
more powerful laser turrets, and do more damage, and it can rotate about
its fore/aft axis bringing all weapons to bear.

Hope you don\'t mind my copying this answer to the lists...

Watch for the full announcement this weekend.  My plans are: 20-40 tons,
1-2 crew, 1 week endurance, and sufficient weaponry, agility, and so forth
to be useful against destroyer-sized craft.

Indeed it seems to be... from just the numbers we\'ve been throwing 
around lately in the piracy debate, I had the feeling that the space 
immediately around a planet should look more like an interstate than
your typical Star Trek "Go into standard orbit and call me if any other
ships are detected..." 

This reinforces the argument for me that a) yes, space around a planet
(at least to the 100d line) will be heavily monitored and regulated, 
b) there ain\'t no friggin way the Imperium is going to be able to keep up
to date records on every 40 and 50 year old freighter on a subsector-
wide basis, not to mention a sector-wide database, and c) there is no 
way that any ship building economy would be able to exist, with that
many ships to keep track of and ships payments so high and profit
margins so low, I can\'t see a real reason *not* to bail out on your 
payments. Thinking of the banks\' record keeping on when ships have 
paid up in an environment that takes weeks or months for information/
payments to travel *anywhere*, coming from ships that may be doing
business a *sector* away, gives me the willies....

Now, if we can just determine if the planetary economies could *really*
pour that much of its resources into building these enormous numbers
of flying buildings...

Ok, so the systems seem roughly compatible at times... So this brings back
the question: Is this realistic to have such "ENORMOUS resources" avail-
able? How much could Earth realistically produce in our [hypothetical]
starports now? (please don\'t use the US as an example and scale it up; I dare
say that that would not fit a good percentage of the world. Or is it a good 
model? Would the majority of the 3I\'s planets have a few high industrial,
high standard of living countries that produce everything and feed off 
the rest of the Third World resources? Do only balkanized planets have 
anything such as countries? I\'ve always had a *very* hard time with what
seems to be Traveller canon of the vast majority of planets only having 
one main [or exclusive] government type; people being as people are, I
find this a *LOT* harder to swallow than the existence of pirates :) ). Does
anyone have any idea how many tons of shipping are in existence now, 
and how many tons can be produced in a year? (ought to be some pretty
good figures for WWII around anyhoo, although that raises another 
problem of wartime vs. peacetime production...) Does the amount of
shipping we are able to produce give a good approximation of what our
theoretical spaceyards would be able to produce?

And who was that lady I saw you with last night? [well, as long as I\'m
full of questions :) ]

Hi Hans, is this of the same magnitude of *world wide* expenses as a % of
GWP, or the same magnitude as of a particular country/ies % of GNP?

Ok, but is this comparable to the *world* expenditure on defense, the
GWP of *Earth*, and the *world* tax rate? Does anyone have figures
on this at hand [I know I could probably find them somewhere or
other if I need to, but....  :) ]? It may fit the US model, or the Industrial-
ized Nations model, but how big a percentage of the GWP is the US/
Western/Industrialized Economy? And does the GWP of Earth fit 
the figures given in TCS or Striker or PE? This is the subject that has
always interested me far more than whether or not pirates exist [of
course they do, I say so :) ], just how accurate or broken is the basis
of the economic system in Traveller? I know that the starship eco-
nomics and shipping figures, etc., bear little or no relationship to 
anything realistic, how about the planetary end?

And a second problem I\'ve been debating: Just how much of a given
world\'s economy is given over to ship building? I know that book X
says that Y gazillions of tons can be built per year by population Z, 
but how much of the planetary output is assumed to be poured into ship
construction? Don\'t those 80 billion folks have anything else to pour
all that ultradense and hi tech into, like roads, and schools, and 
zero G public toilets? 

I don\'t have Striker or TCS, so I have to rely on PE and whatever info
from the other two y\'all\'d like to share [or if one of you would like to
work out a photocopying deal, email me, please!, now that it seems to
have received the official blessing...  I am looking for CT and MT stuff
(who wouldn\'t want "real" copies), but the Atlanta stores have been
mostly stripped, and finding anything except D&D, Warhammer, and
M:TG in Athens is impossible, and I am a gamer, not a collector, so I
can-/will-not pay collector prices (though I did find unopened, new con-
dition copies of Asteroid, Mayday, Snapshot, Belter, Triplanetary,
Dark Nebula, and Double Star in a little mom-and-pop hobby shop
out in a tiny little crossroads town in N. Georgia just a few months ago,
so I know that miracles
still happen :) They didn\'t have numbered stickers and MM\'s signature
on them unfortunately, but that just means that I didn\'t have any qualms
about opening them and playing with them, either! :) Oh, did I mention
that they were $5 each....  gloat, gloat, gloat.... :) ]

Where was I?... Oh, yeah... so before I go and pour a bunch of effort into
trying to use PE as a basis for what can be done in the 3I, has anyone
determined if it gives numbers anywhere near compatible with TCS or
Striker? I know that since it is really a separate game it wasn\'t necessary
to be all that accurate to the RPG, but it would be nice... Once we get
the basis down for how the 3 systems relate to one another, then we can
get started on the argument as to whether they have any basis in Real
Life(tm).

OK, I think I\'ve gotten a little too mired down with details, so I\'ll be
pleased to step back a bit and give you my take on the various parts of
the problem:

    1)  It is a canonical fact that piracy exists in the Imperium. (I don\'t
        think I have to support that, do I? ;-)
    2)  It is a canonical fact that the Imperium thinks piracy is a Bad
        thing and tries to do something about it. Evidence of this are
        the appearance of patrols on the encounter tables, various
        statements in various adventures, some TNS briefs and various
        descriptions of ships that are specifically designed to counter
        pirates and corsairs (I\'ll just mention the article about the
        Sydkai Class \'Cruiser\' in MTJ3 as an example of the latter).
    3)  It is a canonical fact that the Imperium actually deploys assets
        against pirates. Evidence of that is the appearance of patrols on
        the encounter tables and in various adventures and the notes
        about deployment for various ship classes (most notsbly in
        _Fighting Ships_, but also in other sources).
    4)  It is a canonical fact that the Imperium can afford a lot more
        ships than is needed to make life impossible for pirates.
        Evidence of this is the rules from TCS and Striker in particular
        and the cost of warships compared to the population of the
        Imperium in general.

Now these facts put together constitutes a contradiction. You can resolve
the contradiction by changing any one of the four facts. You can assume
that, contrary to canon, pirates do not really exist, except in very rare
cases. Or you can assume that, contrary to canon, the Imperium is really
not interested in dealing with pirates. Or you can assume that, contrary
to canon, the Imperium, while having both the desire and the to suppress
pirates nevertheless keeps most of those assets tied down at their most
important worlds. Or you can assume that the Imperium and its member
planets simply don\'t tax their population nearly as much as they could. 
 
Now, is is likely that pirates would exist, given that the owner of a
pirate is already a multimillionaire, that in order to be more profitable
than a merchant, the pirate ship has to earn its owner more than 6%
interest each year, and that catching a merchant is a very tricky
business that takes lots of patience and lots of luck? Possible, yes,
likely, no.

Is it likely that the Imperium would think that piracy is a Bad Thing and
would like to do something about it? Yes.

Is it likely that if the Imperium did have enough small ships they would
deploy them to suppress piracy? Yes.

Is it likely that the Imperium would collect less taxes than they could,
say the 1% you get by _Striker_ rules after a long period of peace? Well,
if you think the Solomani, Zhodani, Vargr, and Aslans also collect the
long peacetime minimum, then I suppose it is plausible that the Imperium
does too...

Now, I know that it has been said that I\'ve claimed that piracy is impossible
in the Imperium and that I have allowed that statement to go unchallenged,
but what I originally said was that piracy didn\'t make much sense in the
Traveller universe. That is a tad less absolute than \'impossible\', I think.
I don\'t think that I could prove it impossible, and, indeed, I\'ve tried to
remember to hedge my statements with worlds \'well-nigh impossible\' etc.
But I do think I\'ve shown that of the four canonical facts mentioned above,
the piracy is by far the least plausible. 

And, mind you, points 2) and 3) are canonical no less than point 1). FS
speaks of _BatRons_ of Tigresses and Kokirraks being split up and dispersed
on patrols in peacetime. Cruisers too, of course. Not to mention many
different classes of destroyers and escorts.

The only point that is less than canonical is 4). Ship numbers in
_Rebellion_ MAY indicate that only about 1/3rd of what TCS would indicate
are being used by the Imperium on cruisers and battleships. You may
decide for yourself if the position of the Imperium and its relations
to some of its neighbors really support the notion that they are at
eaxtreme peace-time establishment...

Well a collsion with aircraft is usually fatal.  I don\'t know
about space ships.  In any case, the space to the 100 diam limit
is lot bigger than US airspace and space ships can see each
other from alot further off.

Two ships leaving at the same time going to the same destination

	the answer is easy : it depends ;-)

	take a look to the rules (TNE basic book) 

	On a A starport in the Regency you will see a ship when you exit
	jump space with a 6/6 probability, on a A starport in the RC its
	only 5/6 droping down to 0/6 if there is no starport in the wilds.

	The more civilised a system is the more often the first ship you\'ll
	see is a nonstarship, if you move towards the "frontier" into the
	wilds the scout will be the most often ship encounter.

	The Naval Vessel has most times a probaility of 1/6 as its in the
	middle of the table, while the merchant will have often a probabilty
	of 2/6 in systems where trade is posible.

	The likelyhood that the nonstarship is a SQB is between 1/36,1/18,
	up to 7/36, and its also posible that a "Mercenary Cruiser" is
	counted as a civilian ship type. So we end up with that any 5th
	ship is military, and that you see military ships as often as
	traders outside the civilised area. The more you are outside,
	the more raises the likelyhood that this nice warship is a pirate
	or a vampire, and not securing the system, but owning it for a
	short time to make bussiness.

	You should not take those tables to serious. Encounter tables
	are for dull referees, who can\'t tell stories from pure imagination.

	Using these tables you\'ll find no pirates in the Regency and no
	smuggle in the RC or the wilds. While its easy to explain that
	any trade in the RC is good and therefore its not called smuggle,
	its a bit more difficult how those former Sword Worlds Pirates
	have been convinced to become either smugglers or RQS quarantaine
	enforcers. Well they know their work, make a trader stop or shoot
	him down. Just the same bussiness. Becoming a smuggler is also
	their trade, they know where to sell hot stuff.

	"Avoid playing book variations" is one of the main things a Dan
	in Go has to learn. By not using the tables, the answer is much
	more easier. :

	It depends on the referee and his story. Basics, gimicks, push,
	pull, enigma can change the situation drasticaly. You can exit
	in the middle of a bigger fleet training, and several hundret
	ships are fighting using 1Mj reduction for their weapons as a
	gimmik, or you can exit see a pirate on a secure starport, and
	it could be an enigma why the SDB was not there, but travelled
	to the gas giant 1 week ago.

	I could also tell an area where you see a lot of brand new
	traders with SOTA equipment, but you dont see any warship at all.

	My Gushemege (1203) : In the early 40th any warship over 1000dt
	was disabled, reconfigured to become a jump capable starport, 
	and reinfected by the "Last Sane". As a decreet of the Moot
	of JumpPorts, its not allowed to deploy warships over those
	tonage, or to install Missiles, Nukes or any other mass
	destruction weapons.

	On the other hand the so called "Liner" is able to drop cargo
	to accellerate with 3.7G, has 2 firecontrols, 4 meson guns,
	2 xray and 2 normal lasers and 2 sandcaster at 360 brutto
	register tons. This is the basic configuration at TL13, and
	weapon, defense or other capabilities increase when lighter
	power plants are installed. Typical upgrades include meson
	screens and black globes. The so called "Route Protector"
	is bringing the 1000dt limit ab adsurdum as only the fighting
	mass (after dropping tanks & jumpdrive) is counted as brutto
	register tons. And the 3000 & 5000dt ships of the Hopkins CruRon
	are counted as fabrication ships or even small jump port, as
	the drop tanks have a civilian configuration as hangars for
	building Prospectors,Hawks or Liners.

I think we need to establish some basics before the thread erupts into a
flamewar (which I see building).  Realistically, before we can determine
if piracy is practical, some of the points that are ...vague, in canon
need to be addressed.  They are:

1) Just how much space traffic is there (both inter- and intra-
system)?  

2) How good are the various sensor platforms at the various tech levels?
Conversely, how good are the various stealth platforms at the various
tech levels?  

3) At what TL can a system support (not build or develop, buy and
support) a planetary, orbital, and system defense network?  At what TL
can a system support a planetary, orbital, and system detection network?

4) What are the duties of an SDB when the Imperium is not at war.  What
would a rotation cycle be (ie how long would it be on duty before it
could stand down for R&R, maintenance, etc)

5) How involved is the IN in anti-piracy work, or is that the province
of another department (like the scouts)?  Just how much of the presumed
5% of GWP that goes to the military goes to the IN?  How do the
subsector and planetary forces fit in?

6) How much of the industrial capacity is reserved for the IN?  What is
the base TL of the IN, and how does that affect access to the high TL
shipyards for others?  How easy is it to retrofit high TL items (sensors
and stealth equipment) onto an existing ship?

7) How corruptable are starport officials?  (Both STC and shipyard)

8) How easy/difficult is it to forge, alter, create or manipulate ship
identification, papers, transponders, etc?  What market would there be
for cargo, starship parts, starships and the like?

I know that battle lines in this debate have been drawn.  Let\'s redraw
them, or drop the thread.

Yeah, a ship or two won\'t stop that.

Because it takes something like 1 1/2 hrs to get to the 100 diam
limit for an Earth sized planet.

Not if he is even less armed or not armed.  (Note: to avoid
repetition, unarmed merchants have been debated).  Also,
the pirate may have some more armants hiden in place
of cargo (presumably because he makes up the lost
cargo with piracy and smuggling).

Well, actually I only contend the piracy is possible
(depending a lot on how the campaign is set up).

Even an armed free trader can take out a Scout ship.  The
bigger merchant ships can take one out easily.  You are
can report an invasion with one or two Scouts in a system.
You aren\'t even close to putting a dent in piracy with that.

    'body' => 'All right, as a recap, I came to the list last summer, and Doug Berry
called me a troll.  I mostly ignored him.  He proved rather quickly
that he was not a person who was very civil and nearly immediately
concluded that he did\'nt like me. (I don\'t jump to conclusions so
quickly.)

He seldom posted anything pointed my way that was civil and polite, and
now because I characterize this behaviour as "mud-slinging", I am condemned
for not appreciating his opinion, and deluged with others\' "opinion" of
netiquette.

Fine, you may call that Netiquette, but out here in Colorado & Wyoming
call it something else.


OK, here is why I don\'t appreciate Doug Berry\'s opinion of the latest
IG product _Emperor\'s Vehicles_.

I will concede that what I am about to write _is_ in my opinion, but as
someone with as much (if not more) experience with the origins of Traveller
It also bothers me to join in with the "flame the game", but an example is
needed.  I don\'t see Doug\'s opinion as one that is characterized with balance
and measure.

Here\'s why.

Sky Raider\'s Trilogy - Critical Review

Doug opined the view of how great the Sky Raiders was, while in the same
breath going on about Emperor\'s Vehicles\' purported "flaw" being a lack
of TL for each of the designs in the book.  I also put this in the category
of "Traveller Maligning".

I am not one to malign Traveller.  It is a great game, and has provided
me many years of entertainment.  In this case, I feel an example is needed
to clarify my point.  One of my overall favorite works (and there are a
*lot* of them) was the FASA trilogy.

It is also possible that Doug Berry is not as knowledgeable as he claimed
in the *same* post, as I will explain.

However, (as Tuvok would say) it is clear to me that Doug seems to be
focused totally on small things, when he expresses his opinion on the
matter of "the \'lack\' of TL" in EV.  He is holding up as a PRIZE one of
the MOST FLAWED TRAVELLER sources from the earliest history, and comparing
it to a quite good contemporary book for T4 (MMT2).

Now mind you, I *LOVED* the Sky Raider\'s Trilogy.  It was fun reading when
it came out, it was fun playing the parts that I got to (the referee hadn\'t
fully incorporated the adventure into his campaign), and it is fun to look
over the work of two brothers I consider friends. (Andy Keith treated me
like a gentleman when I visited him in Elk Grove village.  He is a true noble,
and fan of the game.)

Take the Asteroid Ship of the Sky Raiders, the adventure Mr. Berry used as
an example in his response to _my_ post (which I said *was* my opinion).
If you read pg.19 of _Fate of the Sky Raiders_, we are told,

      "Instrument readings soon give an idea of the size of the
       gigantic ship.  It measures approximately 10 km x 8 km
       x 7.5 km, and displaces just under 50 _BILLION_ tons
       standard."

OK, those facts match. A quick calculation shows that a cube of those
dimensions yields about 4.3 x 10^11 (~43 billion tons). No mistakes there.
Just under 50 Billion tons.

We are told that the Sky Raiders came from a TL9-10 culture.  We are told
that the ship reached Far Frontiers sector by a combination of sub-light
travel, and Jump.  There are Jump drives on board.

The problems are:

    1) HIGH GUARD had been out for a few years at that point (1982) and
       those rules do not permit even a TL 10 culture to build a ship
       beyond a certain size, no matter how you interpret the rules
       (unless you just ignore them)

    2) a J-1 drive for any ship, 100 tons up to 43 billion tons, requires
       2% of the ship, which in the case of the Sky Raiders\' Asteroid
       means that this particular Jump drive amassed 857 MILLION TONS.

Do you think that the entire Vilani Empire had 857 MILLION TONS OF JUMP
DRIVE?  If so, did the Sky Raiders steal it from the Vilani, or did they
just manufacture it in their Yards, all the time holding the mighty
Vilani Empire at arm\'s length?

OK, perhaps Doug *doesn\'t* know as much about early Traveller, thats fine,
no crime there, but he did invite the considered opinion of someone who
does, and there is no crime in my pointing out this gap of logic.

In light of the discussion, the purported missing TL of vehicles in EV
is small stuff if you *really* care about detail.  nearly a BILLION tons
of Jump Drive is even harder to explain than Terraforming at TL12. :)

I could spend *more* time analyzing Doug Berry\'s assessment, but not
this month.

I have the feeling that if some of the detail that it is claimed *were*
to be added, that there would just be something else.  I can just imagine
calls for tire pressure and distributed track vehicle weights governing
the width of the tracks, and so on.  I could be wrong there, and I\'m not
afraid to admit it.

But, I could be right, and I am inclined to think so when I see the
equivalent of a Janet Reno defending Bill Clinton by comparing him to Ted
Kennedy as a moral (low) standard from which our President should be judged.
"Bill has only been married once, and he does not drink nearly as much as
the Senator."

I\'ll be moving along now (for some reason, I am always in midterms when
Doug goes on one of his tirades).

You\'ll be getting no more Traveller Maligning from me, there\'s enough
already, and Howerd can put that in his pipe and smoke it.

It\'s hard to make this work in the infrared. If the spacecraft is surrounded
by a cloud of something, and the spacecraft is emitting IR, the cloud will be
absorbing the IR - and (by the laws-o-physics) re-emitting it. The total 
energy emitted won\'t change.

On the other hand, you can spread that energy out over more solid angle as
seen by a sensor, and re-emit it at longer IR wavelengths, both of which make
it somewhat harder to detect. 

Another alternative would be a shield adjusted (by careful selection of 
emissivities at different wavelengths and on different sides) to radiate mostly
in one direction (the simplest form would be something that\'s a mirror on one
side (the side facing the spacecraft...) although it\'s hard to make it work
perfectly (because of heat input from stars, etc.)

A lurking ship can use "extreme masking" - turning all its radiators away from
the (known) location of the planet/planetary sensors. That\'ll help somewhat.

Possibly the best way to ambush someone is to hide next to a asteroid - 
there should be a fair number that come within a few million km of a given planet
which reduces signature quite a bit.

   You are right, there is no upper end.  An orbit can take as long as
   you like; you need only move to a higher altitude.
   
   As I\'ve said on three posts previously (does anybody at all read these
   things?)  the lower limit is 85 minutes for all planets regardless of
   size.  (This value will change slightly for planets of different
   /density/ from the earth.  To get an orbit of 60 minutes, the planet
   will need to be (85/60)^2 = 2.0 times denser than the earth.  Gas
   Giants have low density so their orbits will take longer, about 2.5
   times longer, I think.)

   The fastest satellites around the earth travel at 15,240 nautical
   miles per hour, or 28,000 km/hr.  Satelites at higher orbits will 
   travel slower.  There\'s no real limit to how slow they can go.

   The more I hear about the SOM, the more I\'m glad I never bought it.  I
   don\'t know where they got this stuff, but it has nothing to do with
   `orbits\' in the traditional sense of the word.

   Actually, the cost per citizen is probably somewhat lower in the US than
   in the Islands cluster.  This is something of a judgement call because
   its hard to compare dollars to credits.

   Anders made a similar argument.  Piracy exists in real life, so why can\'t it
   exist in Traveller?  The answer is, because starships in Traveller `jump\' from
   haven to haven.  In real life, maritime transports cannot do this.  Because
   starships can jump from haven to haven, to stop interstellar piracy, the Imperium
   need only prevent piracy in its `havens\', ie a 100 diameter radius from the
   mainworld.
   
   Piracy does NOT exist in real life in the harbors of the US for the same reason
   that it can not exist in the Imperium.  It is trivial for our Coast Guard to
   defend small crucial areas from piracy.  If that was all that was needed in
   real life, piracy could not exist in real life.  That IS all that\'s needed in
   Traveller due the magic of jump drive, therefore, piracy CAN NOT exist in
   the Imperium, without the Imperium\'s permission.

   Third world countries tend to spend a larger fraction of their GDP on the
   military than do industrialized countries.  So the US model may be low.

   Yes, Calculating the GDP of the earth in PE terms yields a number
   compatable to real life.  Exact comparison is difficult due to the
   unknown exchange rate between the dollar and the credit.  (Figure
   2-3 dollars per credit.)

   In the US, ~0.2% of the GNP goes to naval shipbuilding. In TCS, it\'s
   more like 0.5%.  I imagine that roads, schools, and public toilets
   come out of the remaining 99%+ in Traveller, as in real life.
   
> From: someone else (I forget who).

   TCS assumes that the Island clusters spend about 5% of their GWP on
   the navy.  The US (today) spends about 3% of its GNP on the military.

Seems reasonable. You may still find these ships in backwater worlds,
though, if those worlds are on the way to a B+7+ world. So there 
might be a small amount of passenger/cargo traffic in these primitive
systems.

Yep, that\'s how I run things.

Right. They can\'t compete with the big corporations (as was discussed
a month or two ago on the TML) on the major trade routes.

Hmmm. My group is in Glisten right now. I\'ve done everything I can
to give them the impression that Glisten\'s space is crowded with
all kinds of ships of all sizes and shapes (some, of course, belonging
to the Imperial Navy fleet based there). 150,000 tons per month of
traffic seems a bit low for Glisten. Perhaps you could add a modifier
of "x 10 if Pop 9+"?

    'body' => 'Autofire Hit Locations--Ken\'s Tweaks

When you are using a hit location chart with Traveller combat, you run
into a problem when you fire at a person (and hit) with more than one
round.

The question comes up, "How many places did I hit him", or "Of my 5
round burst, how many bullets hit him, and what were their locations"?



I\'ve come up with a quickie rule that I want to run by you.  I\'ll use a
standard 5 round burst for the example.

============================================

You\'ve just fired your ACR, pumping five rounds at your target.  You
roll a hit, and how it is time to use your GM\'s House Rule hit location
chart.

How many of those five rounds hit your target?  Where did each round
hit?

STEP 1:  DECIDE HOW MANY HIT WERE MADE.
First, you must decide how many different targets were hit.  Was is just
the one target?  Or did you hit other targets next to your primary
target because of the autofire rule?

[We obtained a hit with our ACR.  We hit not only our primary target,
but also the guy standing next to him.]

Once you\'ve thrown hits on your targets, you know that at least one
bullet hit each target.  Find out how many of the burst are not
accounted for.

[That was a 5 round burst.  We\'ve hit two characters, so 3 bullets are
not accounted for.]

Once you know how many bullets are not accounted for, you proceed to
step two.



STEP 2:  ALLOCATE REMAINING BULLETS
Roll to allocate each remaing bullet.  Start with the Primary target,
then if bullets remain unallocated, move to the next closest target, and
so on.

For each target, roll 1D6-x (where x equals the number of bullets
already spent).

[First we check to see if we hit the primary target with more than one
bullet.  We\'ve hit to total bad guys with exactly one bullet each (so
far), so we roll 1D6-2.  We roll a 4, giving us a total of 2 hits on the
primary target.

That tells us that the primary target has been hit with two bullets.

Next, we check the second guy we hit.  We roll 1D6-3, and we roll a 2. 
This means that the second guy was only hit with the one bullet.

Since there are no more targets, the other 2 bullets that are not
accounted for (2 bullets in the primary target, one in the secondary
target).  3 bullets hit, out of the 5 round burst, 2 bullets hit
nobody.]





STEP 3:  HIT LOCATION FOR AUTOFIRE
Roll a hit location normally, using whatever chart you use in your
game.  If a target is hit with only one bullet, the procedure stops here
(because you know that he was hit once, and you now know the location).

If a target was hit with more than one bullet, roll on the following
chart to see if more than one location was hit.

D6   Location
- ----  ----
1    Move the next location down (towards feet)
2-5  Same location hit
6    Move the next location up (towards head)

I don\'t know if any of you remember that thread about the
difficulties of salvaging an ancient derelict. Somebody mentioned
that metals tend to "flow" over long durations (centuries/
millennia), such that doors will permanently seals themselves to
their bulkheads, and all the once functional equipment (jump
drive, power plant, computer, etc) will become entirely non-
functional simply due to the passage of time.

Well, this problem kept rolling about in my head. I\'ve been
thinking of some plot ideas for a near-future campaign, and one
of them entails some aliens leaving behind a "relic" somewhere on
our planet or in our solar system which they expect us to find.
I\'m not talking about chariots of the gods, where all this relic
has to do is stick around for a few hundred or thousand years.
What I\'m talking about here is a relic capable of surviving the
long-haul.

Picture, if you will, a group of aliens hitting our solar system
some... oh... say two-hundred million years ago. They notice the
planet. They take specimens. They assume that one of these
lifeforms might one day achieve sentience, perhaps even develop a
technological civilization. Now, they could just leave a big coke
can on the beach, but in hundreds of millions of years, it would
get lost underneath the ocean or a thousand sandstorms. They
can\'t dig a big smiley face in the moon. They don\'t have that
kind of fire power (or bad taste). And if they just leave a
transmitter up there for us to find... well, either it would get
hit by a passing meteor or the power supply would probably fail.
Even if they put something in orbit, it would probably come
crashing down long before we\'d notice. In short, what would they
do?

You\'re dealing with a fairly advanced group of explorers here,
but they aren\'t gods. Suppose that they are limited to a standard
imperial tech level, and that they leave a lot of these "relics"
wherever they go... so these things better be cheap (just
something that says "hi... we were here... and by the way, here\'s
how you build a jump drive... have a blast.")

Any ideas?

Pirates who own a multi-million credit starship and have to maintain it

I don\'t know if the analogy of small boat pirating is any better than crime

Hmm. I haven\'t actually run a ship-to-ship combat in a while. Is it that
easy to be that accurate with your weapon systems?

Looking at MT, a standard 400 ton SDB has 4 batteries, all bearing (2
missile, 2 laser). A standard 440 ton corsair has 1 laser, bearing.

In TNE, the SDB is essentially the same. I have no reference for a standard
corsair in my materials.

I seem to remember that, for whatever it\'s worth. :) It may have been lost
in all the lengthy essays, though...

I don\'t think there is any reason to get too hot about any of this. To me,
anyway, all of the posts have been helpful, if only to bring up points
mediocre \'ol me wouldn\'t have thought of. Besides, it\'s all fiction
anywhoo.

Okay, can I start the thread on why I think Traveller\'s view on tech is too
conservative now...? ;)

I agree mostly, although like I wrote, I find the arguments useful to
fleshing out my own setting. :)

For instance, if I were to come to the list and ask "I was wondering, what
are the factors to consider when trying to decide on including piracy in my
Traveller setting." I would like to hear arguments like those that have
been made in this thread.

Of course, I would like them a little less jumbled than they have become --
a list of variables, and points of debate. :)

Coolest question I\'ve seen on the TML all month. 

I can\'t think of anything that\'s 100% guaranteed. Orbital dynamics of the 
solar system as a whole are generally thought to be chaotic on 10^8-10^9 year
timescales, so there isn\'t really any solar-system orbit where the
explorers could park something and expect it to be found - and anyway
anything easily detectable would either be too big to carry, or unlikely to
last (you could probably carry a few-km silvered lightweight balloon, but
it would get destroyed by micrometeorites and/or de-orbited by various effects
long before 200 MYr...) 

In our solar system, the obvious choice is the moon - it\'s not tectonically
active, it\'s close to Earth. The only thing I\'m unsure of is how long it
would take accumulated zodiacal/micrometeorite dust to completely cover
something lying on the surface; anyone know the current rate? I have a vague
feeling it could be as high as 1cm/100Myr, but I\'m not at all sure.)

Depending on when you want your surprise to be found, you probably want to
put it somewhere that\'s hard to study from the ground but interesting enough 
that it will be one of the first places spacecraft look at. In our moon,
I\'d probably pick the south polar crater region - you can\'t see it easily
from the earth but (since water ice might survive there) it\'s a high-priority
area for study. That leaves the question of what to put there...how about
some sort of lightweight mesh radar reflector? Something about 100m2 in
area, maybe a 10cm mesh spacing, supported parallel to the ground by poles
(so that it doesn\'t get buried) like a big tent/awning. Maybe 1000m2 of area;
you could still fold it up into a 1 dTon box pretty easily, and only take a 
day or so to lay it out. Properly designed it could have a very very high
radar reflectivity, especially since you know what direction to optimize
the reflectivity for (since the moon always keeps the same side facing the
Earth.) At high angles of incidence the backscatter from the moon is very
low - even 100m2 would stand out. Of course, the primitive earthlings
might not detect it until they did radar experiments with a satellite 
orbiting the moon, and then they might misinterpret the anomalously high
reflectivity as evidence of water ice, but they\'d still make the polar regions
a high priority target for follow-up missions. Write your message on the
support poles. 

Another good place might be an outer solar system moon (so you don\'t have to
worry about dust as much.) Maybe you could spray-paint half of one of the
moons of Saturn black. Smash a 0.01c T-plate missile into another moon to
make a Really Big crater - that\'ll attract even more attention. Put the
message inside the Really Big Crater.

Put another radar reflector at one of the poles of Mercury.

 Do what Clarke did in _2001:A Space Odyssey_: Bury it on the moon,
leaving some sort of marker (in this case, magnetic) to encourage
excavation. If you\'re worried about it being hit by a rock, bury a couple
of backups as well. And if the planet doesn\'t have a moon, then bury on
some other airless-but-still-mildly-interesting rock that\'s not too far
away.

 Simple, really.

To some extent some of the local governments are merely pretending that
this is a serious problem and actually support certain activities

The Carribean is not part of the US and therefore your comparison is
invalid.  It might well serve as a valid parallel explaining why piracy
exists outside, but near to, the Imperium.  However we are discussing
piracy _within_ the Imperium.  It is true that the US government
perceives that it has some security interests within the Carribean,
dating back to the Monroe doctrine, but it is not part of the Imperium. 
I think that if these pirates in small boats were operating on the
Mississippi the US  would show the political will to deter or eliminate
them.

not so simple.  He was referring to something remaining functional for a
few hundred million years.  That\'s time enough for most everything to

Given that we are rolling for dammage from the weapons hit does it not
seem that when your 3d6 weapon rolls a 6,6,5 that this is more likely to
be a head or body hit and that when your 3d6 weapon rolls a 1,1,2 that
this is more likely to be a limb hit ?

As the charts intended to represent all hits, ranged combat hits only,
or melee hits only ?  I suspect that people get shot in lower legs a lot
more often then they get knifed in them for example.  It seems to me to
be a mistake to consider only relative body area size.  Perhaps we
should look at military or law enforcement data as to where people are
most often injured.  Of the 4 methods #3, the DGP method, seems best to
me but this is subjective.

Of course, if you believe that the Earth is only ~ 10,000 years old, then this really 
isn\'t a problem. :)

One of the problems with this attitude is it assumes that everyone 
who plays Traveller is at your level and views the world the way you 
do. I would imagine that many on TML agreed with you. But I don\'t 
know that TML is particularly representative of role-players at 
large.

I don\'t know that new players want to have to go look up things 
anywhere. You buy a game, you read it, your imagination gets fired, 
you write an adventure, you find some players and you play. Then your 
player asks you what EMS is, or what a neutrino sensor does, because 
they\'ve always played AD&D and haven\'t spent half their life reading 
Sci-Fi. So you crack open the Traveller books to look at what the 
game says before you stick your foot in it and waste half an hour 
looking for something that isn\'t there. Now what? Hey, I\'ll research 
it this week and tell you next game session? At this point the 
players throw up their hands and ask to go back to the AD&D stuff 
where there\'s an answer for everything and then some (too much, if 
you ask me).

I don\'t think a paragraph or two giving a rough idea of what the 
basic concept behind a particular piece of tech is that difficult to 
work into the published products. This doesn\'t necessarily mean 
*rules*. I will *never* ask for more rules. For me, role-playing can 
very quickly get *ruled* to death. But a quick definition of a 
Neutrino sensor that gives a quick definition of a neutrino and that 
the equipment senses them? Why not? Whenever *rules* define a 
neutrino sensor it can go into ranges and accuracy and all that.

Let me give an even better example. I\'m a long-time Traveller player 
but I am not, never have been and never will be a war gamer. But as a 
Traveller player, I\'d use any combat rules that were to come out on a 
squadron level. Great. Now, throw some military terms at me and watch 
me get confused... really fast. I read some rules recently talking 
about Tanker Squadrons and having to have them equal to X percent of 
the fuel requirements of the fleet. But nowhere in that section did 
it really specify why. Ok, I\'m a reasonably intelligent woman. I can 
extrapolate that the Tanker Squadron has to refuel the fleet and much 
further along in the text it did specify the rules involved with 
taking time to refuel the fleet, or at least those portions that are 
incapable of doing so for themselves. Fine. But is it so hard to put 
in that little sentence as to what the requirement is for? 

Yes, I can look it up in probably a thousand places. But if I\'m not a 
wargamer none of them are handy, and if I am a wargamer I already 
know the answer. If something simple will make a text more useful, 
comprehensible and interesting to the readers, it should be put in.

Or am I missing the whole point of this exchange?

This will have to be a very long period of time if the item is placed in
vacuum. I do not know exactly how long or anything like that, but dust would
probably be a much worse problem. The dust on an airless planet, moon or
asteroid would quickly (well, it would take many years) settle in every
detail of an item left outside. An item of metal within the magnetic field
of any kind of planet (or other piece of rock) acts as a magnet (correct me
if I\'m wrong), and would attract small, static dust particles in the same
way as the corners in your room. :-)  In any case, the dust would probably
be a more severe problem than flowing metal.

Also note that the metal flows even less if it is cold. What if the AAA
(Ancient Alien Artifact) was placed in a deep crater or in a cave on some
moon? Eartquakes and cave-ins are NOT commmon on a place without moving
continental plates. The only natural way for the AAA to get destroyed would
be if the area were it lay was hit by a really big rock.

Another thing: Since the planet does not have an atmosphere, heat from the
radiation of the star would not carry on through the air. A little would get
reflected, but ...

How do you know they didn\'t? Take a good look on the moon ... big smiley

all, you DO play roleplaying games :-)

I\'ve given a split vote as IMHO the perception is that Piracy exists.

But, the nature and extent of piracy and will/ability to act against it 
in the relevent campaign setting is at the descretion of the GM to

     I would like to explore the possibility of toning down the heat on the
TML.  I have been watching with interest the threads of piracy and IG\'s
products, but have noticed that the general tone has begun to get ugly.  I am
finding longer and longer messages, each getting longer and longer, but
covering the same ground as before.  Obviously, there is a great debate on
the quality and usefulness of IG\'s products, and I for one (to register my
opinion, to anyone who is curious or may care), do believe that the quality
is not as good as it could be, i.e. not up to the standards I was raised on
(GDW, 1977-1996)  However, having said that, I still purchase EVERY item that
I can get my greedy palms on that in anyway bears any use for a Traveller
campaign!  Even something that is poorly done may have one or two good ideas
that I can swipe for my own use.

     As an aside, I recall someone posting a line that runs along the path of
 (paraphrasing here)  "even unemployed, I can still afford to buy these
books".  I\'m not sure what is meant by that, but in my own case, I am on
Social Security due to disablilty...one IG book represents literally 22% of
my MONTHLY disposable income , yet I still do my best to get every one!
  Why?  Because good or bad I get SOMETHING useful out of it!

     Not everyone will be happy with everything produced...some will not be
happy with anything produced.  And everyone has the right to express there
dissatisfaction (or lack thereof) and be heard.  But degenerating to constant
back-and-forth repeating of the same points solves nothing, and especially
when the attacks take on a personal tone.

     I use the list as I use the IG supplements, magazine articles, books,
etc...a source of new ideas for my campaigns.  Clogging the list with
pointless arguments about things which cannot be settled anyway (hoping this
will come out sounding right) makes it less useful for that.  This is a
game...it is played for enjoyment.   If you believe piracy is possible in
your universe, use it!  If not, don\'t!  After all, you (the GM, aka GOD) make
the rules here!

Good, thoughtful, questions!  I have been trying to work this out myself

I had envisioned these.  Though I had them operating along the
mains(jump1 routs) I picture that they would have three or more jumps
worth of fuel.  I also pictured the Navy using these to supply their
bases.  I would believe that much of the cargo shipped in these monster
freighters are long haul (greater than 10 PC per run).  I would guess that
they are operated by Mega-corps or heavily subsidized by governments.

I pictured generaly 2 classes of mediums.  A jump 1 class that handles
short range traffic along a main, and a jump 3 class to pick up the
class A and B starports off of the mains.  Both classes would be heavily
subsidized by planetary governments and private conserns.  I would expect
that most would be very local in operation, maybe to 10 PC at max.

I pictured a fast freight class to fill this niche.  Most would have over
jump 3 capability to get smaller cargos to destinations quicker.

And making contracts with the larger freight lines to handle smaller
cargos or cargos bound for worlds not serviced by the biggies.

Good starting point.  I would have these modifiers in addition:

X4 if world is along a main.
X2 if A class starport.
X.25 if world is jump 3 or more from a main.
x.5 if world has class C or worse starport.

> 
> douglas@teleport.com
> http:\\\\www.teleport.com\\~douglas\\


I would say that the traffic along the main\'s is mostly historical, going
back to times where all starships were jump-1.  Also, it minimizes the
patrol stations for anti-piracy task forces.  Keeping the mains open
ensures a great majority of the worlds would be free from piracy.

     Has anyone considered the effect of the light-speed lag on piracy
in-system?  By this I mean (for example)  If the Jolly Roger arrives
in-system at a range of 2 light-hours from the mainworld...he will have 2
hours of time to study the military deployments in the system BEFORE any word
of his arrival (or his signature, if detectable) arrives at the mainworld,
which is presumably where STC is located.  If he doesn\'t like what he sees,
then he can jump outsystem again, providing of course he has the capability.
 And what if he is in range of a target (i.e. can at least engage the target
w/ weaponry) well before that limit is up?  He could theoretically engage the
taget, destroy or capture it, and be on his way gone before the authorities
know whats happening!


     I realize there are holes in this you could float the USS Nimitz
thru...but does anyone have any thoughts on it?

   Last I heard, Colorado and Wyoming had similar standards to

   The Sky Raider\'s Trilogy was written very early on in Traveller
history.  If, as you have said for some time, MMT is Traveller, then
what is the excuse for EV, which was written many years later?  Also,
while the data in SRT is without question variant in relation to High
Guard, at least the data was there (unlike EV).  You are comparing
apples and oranges IMHO.

Leroy, I called you a troll after you announced that you had all the

Leroy, my reasons for being slightly rude to you (if you want to see me get
really rude read rec.games.frp.misc for the three-way flames between me,
Michael Richter, and Terry Austin) is that you treated the entire list as a
bunch of lost sheep waiting for you, the Traveller Messiah, to show us how
to play a game most of us have played for decades.

I challenged you to quote where I went on about how great the SR trilogy
is.  In that message, I simply pointed out that in Trail, there is an
extended chase sequence where fuel consumption and fuel avalibility are
major concerns.  This was in responce to your "it rarely matters" comment.

Leroy, the minute you can explain how the size of the jump drives on the SR
asteroid ship relates in any way imaginable to the discussion of Emperor\'s
Vehicles, i will eat three of my hats.  It\'s a sad attempt to change the
topic.  Something you seem to do quite often.

At least we kniow what TL the League of Suns, Descarothe Hegemony, and

All I ask is what has been basic to traveller vehicle descriptions from the

I\'m about as hard-core a gearhead and techie as you\'ll find on this list,
and for what it\'s worth, I agree with Suzette. There\'s a definite lack of
flavour text/explanations in T4. Even FFS2 didn\'t end up with very much - 
partially due to the lack of time, partially due to lack of space. 
I think there is a roll for a T4 equivalent of the SOM - and I\'d love to help
write parts of it. A lot of such text should also go into the basic rule book.
And maybe some in JTAS, if it ever comes out again...

On the other hand, one disadvantage of writing detailed this-is-how-it-works
books is that you\'ve then set in stone things that you may think better of 
later - SOM\'s overdriven engines, for example, or more recent hints that
Fusion+ is Pons-and-Fleischman-style cold fusion.

I didn\'t think we were looking for "functional" so much as "conveying 
information" - like a big metal plaque with an elaborate code inscribed on it,
and something sufficiently to make it moderately detectable.

Leroy, I am rather well-known for my inclusive, congenial, live and let
live attitude on the TML.  I actively work (hard) to foster consensus and
shared research on Traveller-related topics through the THUDDD and other
activities.  I find it remarkable and wonderful that so many people of
such varying opinions can cooperate to examine and extend this shared
obsession of ours.

However, my tolerance falls short of accepting you.  Now, this is simply
my opinion, humble or otherwise -- but your condescension, inability to
see any viewpoint other than your own, and general rudeness quite frankly
rub me the wrong way.  Badly.  You are among a select few people whom I
feel would best contribute to the TML by leaving it.  And I am fairly
certain I\'m one of many people here who feel this way.

More so than myself -- and this is saying something -- Douglas considers
Traveller and the TML as both important and worth defending.  Hence his
few rhetorical explosions in your direction.  However, he\'s never once
descended to the depths which you make your customary home, Leroy.

Nobody outside Marc, Frank, Loren, and their immediate colleagues has
significantly more Traveller experience -- measured in elapsed years,
anyway -- than Doug and myself.  I actually have two more days than he
does, as I bought it at PacifiCon at the GDW booth, and he didn\'t see it
until I got home from the con.  Our first game stared later that same day.

I disagree with this use of terminology.  To say "Emperor\'s Vehicles" is
bad is not to say "Traveller is bad," any more than to say "Event Horizon
is bad" is to say "SF movies are bad."  This is an elementary failure of
logic, or an attempt to twist rhetoric to your own ends.  Either way, it
does not reflect favorably on you, Leroy.

So, then, is your dissing of Sky Raiders "Traveller maligning," or not?
You can\'t have it both ways.

Were graduate degrees in Traveller available, Douglas would hold one.  I\'m
sorry, but you would be very hard pressed to find *anyone* with
significantly more knowledge about Traveller, nor better able to integrate
and apply that knowledge, than Douglas.

And now we begin to reach the core of your error.  You seem poised to
reveal some more egregious failing in SR, which will cause EV\'s blemishes
to pale in comparison...

(Note to Leroy: Name-dropping is yet another rhetorical flourish which
just don\'t cut the mustard.  Argue your point on its own merits.)

A "fact" which has been among the most fluid in later versions of the

Not \'amassed\', but \'occupied\' -- these were displacement tons.  A quibble,
of course -- your point (that this was a truly humungous J-Drive) remains
entirely true.

This is where my jaw hit the floor.  Your comparison of the SR and EV
problems is on two entirely different *levels*!  SR provides all needed
data on ship size, performance, and so forth -- which figures create a
*game-world dilemma* on explaining how so much equipment got built.  EV,
on the other hand, creates a *real-world dilemma* that data necessary to
usefully introduce the vehicles provided *into* game worlds does not
exist.  It\'s like the difference between

   2 + 2 = 5    (SR)

and

   F* \\a ? *    (EV)

The first is clearly an expression following the conventions of
arithmetic, and thus is *within* a well-defined system, under the terms of
which we can argue about its validity; the second contains too little
information about its containing \'metasystem\' to say anything useful about
it at all.  The second category of problem is clearly far more serious.

Sheesh...Leroy, do you understand who you\'re talking about here, and how
weak your argument is?  And how being willing to posit that a whole lot of
J-Drive got built is *very* different from being willing to accept vehicle
listings without data which has been considered fundamental to *any*
Traveller equipment since CT?

Ah, advancing a straw man, another favorite trick of the rhetorician

been a fundamental part of all Traveller equipment listings since CT.

I\'ll by that. 3 standard Traveller space combat rounds.

If a pirate can take out a ship in that amount of time, and load 
cargo/commandeer the vessel, then that\'s either one mighty unlucky 
vessel, or one helluva pirate ship...

If that is your contention, then I agree. One could set up a campaign 
that allows piracy to exist. No prob.

I was arguing this thread on the premise that "Due to Traveller\'s 
economic, interstellar travel, and space combat mechanics; and the 
socio-economic background we have published in Traveller, piracy is 
virtually non-existant in systems with significant trade under the 
protection of the Imperium."

I would also contend that in Milieu 1100, *if* piracy was relatively 
common in a system, the Travellers Aid Society would amber zone the 
system.

Maybe we should start these threads in a more scientific way and posit a 
Hypothisis at the start of the post so we don\'t get carried away arguing 
in circles . . :P

 That\'s why you put it on the moon - no wind, no rain, no tectonic
activity (I think). The worst things you have to worry about are being hit
by a rock, or being stolen by some _other_ alien species :)

 As for remaining functional, the Monolith obeyed Clarke\'s law -
its functioning was indistinguishable from magic.  Though seeing as Jim
was asking about Traveller, I was thinking of something a little simpler,
like a platinum-iridium plaque or something.

Interestingly enough, it hasn\'t come up yet.  There hasn\'t been *any*
personal combat in any one of my games since T4 came out.  ;-> However, I
would think the player should have control over applying the dice.

On a related subject, I got to thinking about T4\'s damage system while
stalled in traffic last Tuesday morning, thinking about Traveller in
traffic jams keeps my blood pressure down.  ;-> Anyway, I started thinking
about damage and hit locations because I had accidentally banged my head on
a branch while watering the plants that morning and was still sporting a
nice headache.

"Hum..." thinks I, "A blow to the head reduces STR, END, or DEX?  I don\'t
know, maybe it should really reduce INT or EDU?  I certainly couldn\'t
conjugate latin verbs after whacking my head.", not that I could before
banging my head...

....but anyway, let\'s consider a blow to the head.  Shouldn\'t that cause a
temporary reduction to INT or EDU rather than one of the physical Stats?

A boxer can be knocked unconscious with a blow to the head, then be brought
to and *physically* be strong, agile and constitutionally ready to
continue.  Heck, the mere fact that a boxer will *think* he can continue
proves his brain isn\'t working too well!  ;-> Anyway, officials don\'t let
the fights continue because of the danger of permanent injury (or death)
from continued brain poundings now, but a hundred years ago if the boxer
could get back up within a minute or two and wanted to continue the fight
kept going.

OTOH, boxers "work the body" in an attempt to reduce his opponent\'s END,
STR, and agility (ok, we call it DEX, but I\'d personally like to break that
stat in two).  So, it makes sense for blows to the torso to reduce
endurance and strength.  I recall taking a punch to my solar plexus a few
years ago...it dropped me like a rock and left me gasping for air.  Maybe a
hit on the abdomen should reduce END more than anything?

I got a "stinger" a couple of weeks ago from a sharp whack to my shoulder. 
It *certainly* reduced my use of that arm, ie DEX & STR, but it didn\'t seem
to have an effect on my END after a few seconds of being unable to do
*anything*, that is.  Maybe a blow to an arm or leg should reduce DEX & STR
considerately more than END?

What do you think of the following modifications to the T4 damage method?

 Blow To        Reduces
 ============================
  Head          INT, EDU
  Chest         STR, END, DEX
  Abdomen       END, STR, DEX
  Arms          DEX, STR, END
  Legs          STR, DEX, END
  
 1. Damage is taken in the order listed one die at at time.  If after
    one die has been applied to each Stat listed for that hit location
    there are additional damage dice to be applied, the player may
    distribute them among the appropriate Stats as he sees fit.  In the
    case of a Head wound, if both INT and EDU are reduced to 0 any
    remaining dice are applied to END.
 
 2. If INT, EDU, END or STR are reduced to 0, or below, the PC falls
    unconscious.  Reducing two of the above Stats to 0 causes the PC to
    become seriously wounded.  Reducing any three of the above Stats to
    0 causes immediate death.
    
 3. Recovering consciousness requires succeeding in a (4d6) task
    against *permanent* (not reduced by injury) END+INT.  Task attempts
    can be made every 20 Combat Turns.  Seriously wounded PC\'s must
    succeed at a (6d6) task against END+INT and must receive medical
    attention to regain consciousness.  Seriously wounded PC\'s are in
    immediate danger of "shock" and death.
    
 4. Reducing DEX to 0, or below, does not render a PC unconscious, but
    does reduce the PC\'s ability to successfully complete tasks that
    require any sort of agility or dexterity.
    
 5. If the sum of damage from one blow exceeds the PC\'s current DEX the
    PC is "Knocked Down" and can take no actions this combat turn.
    
 6. If the sum of damage from one blow exceeds the PC\'s current END the
    PC is "Stunned" and can take no actions this combat turn.

Yes, head blows will drop a PC more quickly than body blows because the
dice are being distributed over 2, rather than 3 Stats, but that\'s not a
bad result, IMO.  

Oh, and I\'ll use WILL+END to regain consciousness, but unless you add a
WILL stat, INT will have to do.  I also break DEX into DEX (manual
dexterity) and AGL (balance/foot-quickness), so DEX will lead on Arms and
AGL will lead on Legs.

With the inclusion of INT & EDU, I\'m also considering changing the "blow
through" rule a little.  Instead of putting a cap at 3 dice, I\'d like to
put the cap at 4 dice (maybe 5).  

Well folks, what do you think?

Built for utility, not speed, the Swallow is a typical small sailboat,
capable of carrying five passengers and three cubic metres of cargo. No
sensors or communications gear is installed; if carried, these are usually
personal models. 

Similar boats can be encountered on many worlds, even at higher tech levels.
Solid construction means that, with proper care, a Swallow can last for over
a century.

Leroy, I don\'t think Doug called you a troll.  He said you were "trolling"
and that\'s a little different.  Not *much* different, but a little.  ;->

A troll is a nasty, aggressive, and brutish being that you can hack to
pieces, but it will regenerate (actually the pieces will rejoin, I think)
and continue to fight.  Don\'t you have to burn the pieces to actually
destroy them?  Doug would have to *really* dislike you to call you a troll.

Trolling, OTOH, comes from a a fishing technique where bait is dragged
behind a boat in hopes that *something* will take a bite and you can reel
it in.  In EMail terms I take it to mean posting a controversial message or
question in hopes of getting some unwary "fish" to answer, and thereby
start a long and mostly meaningless thread.  Trolling is bad netiquette,
and leads to much wasted bandwidth as people post and repost on inane
subjects, but it\'s not *nearly* as bad as being a troll.

I have to agree.  Leroy, you have a bad habit of gratuitously dropping
names from the Traveller Pantheon in you messages.  It would be different
if you were citing the name for some reason other than to associate
yourself with them, but well, it *reads* like you are just trying to puff
your importance by association.  I find it more than a little annoying, but
I\'m sure you don\'t mean anything ill..just a bad habit..right?

Leroy concludes...

Gee whiz!  I didn\'t follow the Terra TL debate too closely..it didn\'t
interest me..but isn\'t that pretty much the same reason you gave for not
posting your sources back then?  Yes it *is* midterm time at many schools
right now, so the question your academic adviser might ask is "Why do you
get involved in these time consuming controversies right before
finals/midterms?" ;->

In the final analysis can\'t we say, Leroy liked the book, Doug and Harold
did not, everybody has stated their positions.  Enough said?

I thought about that...but I\'m not sure how long ice would last on the lunar
surface before being buried, sublimating away, or getting ablated by cosmic-
ray exposure. Could be 1 MYr, could be 1 GYr - it\'s well outside my field.
I\'m also not 100% sure what timescales the location of the lunar pole is 
stable on - if the pole shifts/precesses the crater floor gets lit up and the
ice melts.

carried by BD units in M0.  It\'s almost as lethal as a laser rifle, and has
a much better weight/shots ratio.  Even assuming that the laser rifle would
be plugged into the BD\'s onboard power source, this thing draws no power
and therefore permits greater range.

Yes, you have a point.  What we need is an expert in metallurgy who can
say if a metal plaque or something similiar can exist for 2-3 hundred

 How about a some sort of sound detection gear,  and a high
power speaker that can be mounted on a wall.
  To use, place detector and speaker on wall that you want to
check if there is air pressure behind.   Now have the speaker
pulse sound thru the wall and listen for a echo off the other
side of the compartment with the sound detector, < your ear
would not have the sensitivity >.
  A good design point would be to not require it to have air
pressure on your side of the wall.  Also make it so it works
underwater. <There is a wide range of enviroments to S&R in.>
  And tell Spofulam to keep the sound pulse level down below
100 decibels,  or you hear in addition to the echo, the painful
screams of thr rescuee\'s you are there to rescue.
  Of course, if they are screaming the are easier to locate
using the sound detector gear....

I remember a college physics exam where I had to calculate the speed and
height of an orbiting sattelite.

I suspected I had a problem when the sattelite was orbiting the earth in
about 100 seconds!

I knew I had a problem when it was doing it at a height of three meters!!!

I redid that part of the question, and went on to pass the exam (just).

"Please Captain, don\'t put Lt Harris in charge of astrogation, at least,
not while we a we going into orbit."

I guess that sort of thing is an example of a failure, and a spectactular
failure would have been getting those results and not noticing the problem.

over that sort of distance not only will interstellar gas and dust have
an effect, but the gravity fields of every star it goes anywhere near
will too.

There\'s actually an upper limit of sorts. 

If you get far enough away, you are going to wind up orbiting the
*star* rather than the planet. That\'s because the star will be exerting
more force on you than the planet will.

OK, Traders and Gunboats has a SDB that has 4 turrets and Fighting
Ships has one that has turrets.  In any case, the "bigger" SDB has
a cost that about 3/4 the cost of Kinunir.

In the end, as you said, the SDB only gains 20% being non jump
capable and 400 tons is not large as ships go.  I would not want
to be able to depend on dominating every engagement with one.

Craig,  I haven\'t followed your posts that much, but from what little I
have seen, I would agree.  At the same time, e-mail can be a fleeting
form of communication, and flame can be perceived where there was none,
and so on.


>(Note to Leroy: Name-dropping is yet another rhetorical flourish which
>just don\'t cut the mustard.  Argue your point on its own merits.)


Funny that you and your brother see it that way.  No its not, I\'ve met
the man who wrote the product that I was about to flame, in Traveller
Maligning List fashion, and personally, I have too much spine to flame
the works of someone I know.  Wouldn\'t be adult, manly, or any of that
rot.  So naturally I had to clear the air first, I do have some basic
tact afterall, despite the words that some without so much spine attempt
to put in my mouth.

Andy Keith is one the nicest individuals I have ever personally met and
it just did not feel right to malign something that he wrote.  It would
have been fun to work with Andy, had Kerry Lloyd of GameLords Ltd. been
able to stay afloat (and please don\'t call _more_ name-dropping, just be
civil or is that too much to ask).  I am not surprised to see that Doug
would go that way, but you too?  I haven\'t formed a lasting opinion of
you yet.  I am also taking into account for the fact that he is your
brother.  You might help him work on this.  Anyway, are you _really_ the
person that I quoted above--do you really try to have tolerance for what
others say?

Please don\'t misconstrue my words as anything in the way of a personal
attack on you, but with some of the race-baiting I had to endure in
another forum, I may be a bit sensitive these days.


>Craig Berry - cberry@cinenet.net


Having seen how some on this list can contort issues sheds light on the
way that some try it in much more mediocre forms elsewhere.  Thank you
for helping to point that out.  It is pretty clear now.

Rather than continue the flames, try and discuss with your brother how
he might have misinterpreted my post, and what things he _may_ have
overlooked in thinking this all through.  I am _not_ out to Malign and
I could use your help in this whole issue with Doug, if you are the person
of the first paragraph of your post (and I have _no_ reason yet to think
otherwise).  [It is actually sad because from what little I\'ve seen of
Doug\'s posts where his private life enters TML, I think we have a number
of things outside of Traveller in common.]

Ok, since the "relic" doesn\'t actually have to *do* anything, it\'s
*much* easier. I\'d go for some sort of "super micro fiche". Say diamond
"sheets" with inclusions that form the images and words. Diamond is
*not* expensive by even a couple of tech levels from now.

If you keep the pictures fairly "large" (still requiring magnification,
but perhaps not too much) the inclusions won\'t spread enough to make
things unreadable.

The hard part is keeping the sheets or plates from sticking to each
other. Best I can think of is to have them held in some sort of "racks"
(like a slide tray) by the edges, and not have anything too close to
the edges. If the rack material is weak enough, you could break the
sheets loose without damaging them.

The *real* hard part is figuring out how to "encode" the message such
that it can be unambigously decoded by a culture you know nothing about.

Why bother moving from the jump point?

Also, given the "canonical" shipping of resource type items around
(don\'t get me started on why anybody with fusion reactors won\'t bother
shipping ores and refined metals around), you should also see *huge*

The ones in low orbit move about 8 km/sec. The farther out, the slower
they travel.

As for how long it takes before you see them again, that depends on
both the orbital altitude *and* on the orbital inclination. For
instance, a satellite in a low, polar orbit may not be visible again
for an entire *day*. 

I\'m sorry, but you are looking for "simple" answers to questions that
don\'t have them.

Just to give you an idea of how *far* two light hours is, it\'s only
*five* light hours to *Pluto*. 2 light hours is 2.16e12 meters. An AU
is 1.5e11 meters. And the 100 diameter limit for earth is about 1.28e9
meters. 

So at 2 light hours, you are about 14 AU out (Out around Saturn?), or
about 1700 times the 100 diameter limit.

So the odds of any traffic being near you are pretty slim.

A bit of anecdotal evidence here....

I used to live at the top of a 500 foot hill. Nice even slope going
down. And as I and my friends found, you could "run" really, *really*
fast downhill. This is a somewhat equivalent situation in that inclined
planes tend to simulate lower G for some things.

We could indeed go very fast. But if you lost control, you tended to
roll for 50 yards or so.

While I know that it\'s not the same, I do tend to use memories of this
as inspiration for movement at low g.

You are confusing flight *plans* and aproach/departure paths.

A flight pland essentially says "We\'re going to take off from XXX, make
the run to the jump point like this (ie, coast, accelerate all the way,
accel halfway decel halfway, etc). And we\'ll be jumping for YYY from
*this* part of the 100 diameter limit. ...... "

The approach departure stuff *isn\'t* on file it\'s assigned by the STC
controllers in realtime based on your flight plan, and what kind of
traffic there is in the areas you\'ll be passing through. Also things
like maintaining proper distances from various military
ships/satellites, etc (the military will *not* want you coming within
*very* large distances of some of their stuff, just because they don\'t
want photos of it showing up....)

So you may get told to follow a path that swings a fair ways from the
"straight line" that you\'d otherwise be following. And except in
*really* crowded systems, it\'ll be normal to keep ships quite a ways
apart. 

Remember, for an earth sized planet (Size 8) it takes about 2.6 hours
at 6g (accel halfway, decel halfway) to go from the planet to the 100
diameter limit. At one g it takes 6.3 hours. So the ships are rather
"close" in terms of travel time.

the general "rule of thumb" is that at 3 km/sec an object has impact
energy equivalent to an equal mass of TNT. And the energy gos up as the
*square* of the velocity (so at 6 km/s you have 4 times the "boom".).

A ship doing the accell halfway/decel halfway bit from 100 diameter
limit to a size 8 planet at 6g will have a peak velocity of 274 km/s.
That means that every ton of the ship has an impact energy of 8.4
*kilotons*. So if the ship masses a mere 100 tons (say 300-400
displacement tons). it\'d be the equivalent of an 840 kiloton nuke if it
hit at speed.

It\'s not bigger if you think in terms of travel time. It takes a slow
(1g) ship about 6.4 hours from the 100 diameter limit to the planet.
And it takes a fast one (6g) 2.6 hours. 

Also, ships have a bigger "danger zone" than planes. Especially of they
use reaction drives (You don\'t want to route a ship thru another ship\'s
exhaust until it has had time to disperse a lot).

Depends on a lot of factors. For one, they\'d have to be running at the
same acceleration. And they *won\'t* be allowed to leave "at the same
time". Again, safety dictates that there be at least a few minutes
between them.

The best point to jump to a given star from is the part of the 100
diameter limit where your velocity has the best match with the
destination. 

In a "few minutes" a typical planet will move 9000 km. and it\'s
velocity vector will have changed direction by 12 seconds of arc.
That\'s almost 80 km at the 100 diameter limit. 

So the ideal jump point for the two ships is 9000+ km different. And
that\'s ignoring a few details.

<sigh>

This is *backwards* For the same atmosphere type, the atmosphere will
extend farther out on a *small* planet. This is because atmosphere
depth is aeesentially a spring function. That is, the atmosphere is a
spring and gravity is the weight pressing on it. The less weight on the
spring, the taller the spring stands....

Sorry, but again, it doesn\'t work this way. A ship that is *in orbit*
moves at a velocity determined by the planet\'s mass and the orbit\'s
radius. And *only* at that speed.

To move at any other speed would require using the engines.

That\'s a powered flight, *not* an orbit!

Sorry, but unless the ship is under powere, it\'ll take *at least* 85

I don\'t think you are - in fact I agree entirely.  As an experiment, I
looked up "neutrino" in the dictionary:

  Neutrino n. Physics.  a stable leptonic neutral elementary particle
  with zero rest mass and spin 1/2 that travels at the speed of light.
  Two types exist, one being produced with positrons in neutron decay
  and the other with positive muons in pion decay.

OK, I happen to know (*very* roughly) what that means - but to many
people this translates as

  Neutrino n. Techie stuff.  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
  blah blah blah goes as fast as light blah blah blah...

There is a certain percentage of words where, if you understand less
than that percentage, you cannot make sense of the text.  Collins
Dictionary seems to assume that if you\'re asking about neutrinos you
know quite a bit about physics.  This is usually a safe assumption, but
not when dealing with roleplaying.  So:

Point #1:  Roleplayers often need to find information in layman\'s
           language about a subject generally left to specialists.

This does not just apply to SFRPGs, by the way.  Fantasy roleplayers
often want to know details concerning the economics and/or laws of
feudalism, for instance.  Or castle construction.

OK.  For my next experiment, I tried looking up EMS:

  Ems n. 1. a town in W West Germany...[naah].  2. a river in West
  Germany...[oops].

No good.  You can\'t really get anywhere with abbreviations if you don\'t
have specialist sources, because abbreviations are a shorthand for
specialists who know what they are talking about.  At work I can witter
on about using TCP/IP to transmit data collected via DMA on a mixed
PCI/ISA backplane, safe in the knowledge that I will be understood by
the people who need to understand.  In fact, I am partly relating
information I myself do not have, because I don\'t actually know what all
those mean - I just know the effects they have on the software I write.
So,

Point #2:  Abbreviations need to be explained.

I find Suzette\'s wargaming case interesting, because I have learned a
lot of military terminology from RPGs.  SMG, LOS, ATV - the list goes
on and on.  In fact, this is pretty much my sole source of information
in this area, because it has been picked up "in passing" when looking at
other subjects which are of more interest to me.

One final point:  I will buy books which contain no new information if
they present the old info in a manner which is suited to my needs.  That
organisation is added value enough (some of the GURPS historical books
fall into this category).

Apologies for the soapbox.  I promise to post something more directly
Traveller-related before my next exposition...

The time was not quoted, as I recall.  And everyone remembers the time 
required for the Death Star to come "into view" of the moon where the 
rebel base was.  At 6G, it would not take that long to move into firing 
position - in fact, at 6G the Death Star could dodge out of the way of

Opening your argument with a personal attack is to me a very poor 
comment on the substance of your points.  I am sorry to see that you 
proceed to prove me right.

While I almost never post, this has provoked me.  You devote a great 
deal of time to ripping Sky Raiders and (by implication) Doug for 
being a fan of Sky Raiders.  Unfortunately, this is wholly irrelevant 
to the topic  --  the usefulness (or lack thereof) of Emperor\'s 
Vehicles.

First of all, Emperor\'s Vehicles is a supplement for *Traveller* and 
no other gaming system.  As such, I would expect it to have fully 
detailed gaming statistics (particularly given that the vehicle 
generation system can be extremely detailed!).  Any deficiency in 
this regard is a bug, not a feature.  Your defense seems akin to 
having a car without a speedometer and being told you can figure out 
your speed by timing the mile markers with a stopwatch.

Second, I don\'t care whether Sky Raiders has flaws or whether Doug is 
a booster for Sky Raiders.  Tearing either of them down means doodly 
squat about Emperor\'s Vehicles -- you are merely trying to deflect 
the terms of the debate

Third, I don\'t care what (if any) fault for personal attacks is the 
fault of others -- *you* are perpetrating and perpetuating 
incivility.  Stop whining, take responsibility for *your* actions and 
develop a thicker skin.

ObTraveller:  a previous poster referred to "debate" such as this as 
being indicative of a difficulty in managing a far-flung Empire.  
That\'s a good point -- indirect diplomacy even on its best day is 
going to be a difficult way to run an empire!

If you want to use that as a reason, you might as well not bother buying *any* 
book - it\'s *all* the domain of the ref. This was supposed to be a sourcebook 
containing pre-designed vehicles that can be used during a game. I could (and 
often have) simply made up values on the spot, but this is designed to save you 
the trouble (and more importantly, it gives you vehicles that are legal 
according to the design rules, which made-up ones often aren\'t). If you\'re 
saying refs should do all the work themselves then why did you buy it?

Of course it is, otherwise I wouldn\'t have asked. I\'m on a TL8 world - can I 
buy one here?

No, it says "Civilians may purchase surplus or decommissioned personnel 
vehicles from the ISD", but nowhere does it say this is one (and since it\'s not 
an Imperial vehicle (ie doesn\'t have the prefix \'Imperial\'), I would assume it 
isn\'t).

All we can say for certain is it\'s between 5 and 12. Probably. The laser 
rangefinder makes it more like 7-12. I agree that 8 is probably right, but it 
might be 7, or it might be 9.

No (see above).

If you try hard enough you can justify finding anything anywhere. I want to 
know what I\'m *likely* to find.

Scout ships are found wherever they\'re sent - they\'re *designed* to travel 
about a lot, *especially* to lower-tech worlds. Vehicles tend to stay on the 
world where they\'re made, simply because it\'s cheaper that way. If they are 
exported, they\'re unlikely to go to a world with a vastly different TL, because 
where will you get it fixed if it breaks down?

What picture? The one on p66? How do you know which vehicle (if any) it

If I showed you a picture of a Leopard 2 MBT and a T-72 side by side, could you 
tell me that one had a crew of 4 and the other 3? Just by looking at a picture, 
what\'s the crew of the USS Nimitz?

What a ridiculous answer. I don\'t know about anyone else, but I\'m using T4. 
This isn\'t a generic sourcebook that can be used for any system you like.

I\'m not saying it\'s something that\'s going to come up every session, but it\'s 
nice to know. And the designer must have worked it out when creating the 
vehicle, so why not list it?

It has nothing to do with that. It is based entirely on the endurance (which

But what\'s the point of including a card for it? By all means mention it in the 
intro to that section, but if you\'re going to go to the trouble of including a 
card for a vehicle, to then not bother to fill it with anything useful is 
stupid. If the ref wants to use it he\'s got to go away and design it himself, 
and if he\'s going to do that then why did he buy the book in the first place?

I might have been if it had been called "The Emperor\'s Guide To 1990s British

I\'m medically retired, and I don\'t find it hard to buy them either. I never 
said I did. They *are* overpriced, but that\'s another argument. But if a book 
claims to have "dozens of vehicles...described for *easy integration* into your 
Traveller campaign" (my emphasis), then I don\'t expect to have to go through 
and redesign every bloody one myself before I can use them, just because IG 
were too stupid to include something as basic as the TL.

I\'m not expecting it to do so, and I\'m not asking it to. Only a fool would 
suggest it could. All I ask is that a sourcebook does the job it claims to, 
which EV fails to do.

No, you\'re right, I don\'t. When I pay $23 for a book of pre-designed vehicles, 
I don\'t expect to get a list of \'suggestions\' that I could quite easily think 
up myself for free.

Whatever gives you that idea? I began migrating my campaign to TNE, but most of 
it was MT. I objected to much of the vagueness of TNE, unlike the hard facts 
you got with MT (101 Vehicles, for example).

I can handle them, I just object to paying to do so.

And you do appear to be the only person to like EV (if anybody thinks you\'re 
right and I\'m talking rubbish, I\'d be interested to hear from them).

This depends upon your viewpoint. A troll (to me) is a creature similar to
humans, but born of the Darnkess rune. nasty, aggressive and brutish, yes.
But they have a complex society and a role to play in the World. Diminished
since the Curse Of Kin, the Uz (as what humans call Trollsname themselves)

Trolls are admirable and noble. Sort of.

having just stopped using a home-written combat system in favour of the

it just for the players\' howls of protest....)


Stun damage is a funny thing. I took a fluke hit a while ago in an epee
match. My oppoinent\'s thrust caught in the velcro fastening of my glove. We
were both closing too fast like a pair of idiots, and both simultaneously
attacking. His (stiff!) blade bent double before freeing itself to spring
straight - right into a rib! The electric tip isn\'t heavy, but there was a
lot of force behind it. There was no \'real\' damage besides an impressive
bruise, but I stopped functioning as a sentient being for about 15 seconds
(I\'m told). Apparently I wandered slowly away in a daze before \'coming to\'
and continuing the fight (which I won). No real damage done, but the hit
was astonishingly painful - so much that it reduced by INT to zero (no
difference there!). I had absolutely no idea what I was doing in those
seconds until my brain rebooted.

I have also been kicked in the solar plexus (instant lie-on-the-floor time,
couldn\'t breathe at all for a while. Eventually I got up and went about my
business (sparring - quite active) with no real difficulty. But at the
time..... The kick to the head I once took did the INT thing again.
Suddenly I\'m looking at the ceiling and wondering what it\'s doing in front
of me, can\'t understand why everyone\'s so worried. Again I was fine after a
few minutes, but totally out of it at the time. Perhaps stun damage should
affect the three \'mental\' stats? 

So: How about Stun damage affects any three of END, INT, EDU, SOC, Lethal
damage any three from STR, END, DEX, INT, as ruled by the referee when the
hit is taken. Common sense should suggest which three are used (INT only on
head hits in lethal damage?)

That said, the only things to get shot in the last 7 Traveller games were
two security bots, plus a fistfight.

As an aside, I think Brawling damage should do Stun damage only - but it
should also be possible to decide that one is going to kick an opponent to
death. Say once a stat reaches zero, it begins to take \'real\' lethal
damage. This solves the knife vs brawling problem (I think!). You can put a
man out of a fight fairly quickly with fisticuffs, but it\'s quicker to kill
him with a knife.

Additionally, I allow extra damage for STR (-1 damage per 3 points of STR
under 7, +1 per 3 points over). Ie: STR 1-3: -2, STR 4-6 -1, STR 7 Normal,
STR 8-A +1, STR B-D +2, E+ +3. This only applies to brawling and impact
weapon damage (swords, clubs etc). I raise the Foil damage to 2D (impaling
weapons are quite deadly) and allow high END to reduce damage taken (END
9-B: -1 damage, END C+ -2 damage.) This makes no difference at all when
shot with a laser rifle, but in a fistfifght the -1 or whatever is a big
help.

The 3D limit seems reasonable for high-velocity weapons which will pass
through (though I\'d raise it to 4D), but what about shotguns, energy
weapons and dumdum/glaser type rounds designed to stop quickly and this
impart all their KE to the would area? I\'d allow +1 Die damage for these
types, and maybe give lasers their full damage (the only way this weapon
can come out the back is by vaporising all the tissue in the way, which
also damages surrounding tissue. That\'s got to be more than 3/4D!)

Thoughts?

250,000 merchant ships in the Spinward Marches, average 1000 T in size.

660 big ships in Imperial Naval squadrons

20,000 support ships (including fighters) for the big ships

7200 SDB (only in Pop 7+, TL 7+ systems)

Most of these ships will be concentarted near the Hipop worlds and on 
trade routes between HiPop worlds.  If these ships were spread evenly 
over the 400 worlds of the Spinward Marches, we would never need fear 
pirates (oops, it is that thread again - sorry).

In terms of a database, 250,000 ships and 5,000 new builds each year is 
trivial task ... much smaller than births, deaths and marriages (or 
even cars), which we seemed to manage quite well back in 1960 when our 
computer systems were virtually non-existant.  New registration and 
re-registarion (for new owners) would only take two months to spread to 
all the TL 7+ or Starport B+ systems.  It is no worse a task than the 
world-wide airline timetable that is printed every month.  Some of 
those TL7 worlds might use paper-based books and so always be an extra 
month or two behind in their directories, but nothing serious.

TL6- worlds and Pop 6- worlds without naval or Scout base would be 
prime "piracy" sites - which is where i would send my anti-piracy 
forces to patrol.

Here is the detailed arguments for those who want to know:

OK, here they are.  (I have to put this into a database so I can quit
crunching the numbers by hand each time I do this!)
 
[Note - my system for calculating population is to assume the pop code
range goes from half below to half above.  (ie. Pop Code 4 has a range 
of 500 to 5000)  In this way, the code is equal to the average 
population.  I am not stating this to start any dispute, simply so you 
will know how I get my numbers.]

Total shipyard (Class A) capacity is 6,163,695 (plus change) tons per
week.  However, 2,251,385 of that capacity is TL B-, which IMHO, would
be...underutilized for the Imperial Military.
 
Almost a full third of the capacity is held by two starports, Rhylanor 
and Trin (which I missed on my listing of TL-F Pop A starports, ref: my
previous post)[which is also why the Imperials consistantly kick ZHO
BUTT!!  :)
 
Now, starting with the figures given above, who wants to figure out how
much of this shipbuilding capacity is used by the Imperial fleets based 
in and around the Spinward Marches?  (I\'m not!!)
<end quote>

Although Douglas has shown capacity as "per week", this is not quite 
how the ship building system works.  If we take Douglas\' key data:

6,163,659 T capacity

From my earlier posting about starport size, it is not unreasonable to 
have approximately 15 to 20% of this capacity used by the Navy (as the 
Cr500 per person tax will not support more navy than this).  the 
remaining 80 to 85% shipyard capacity is for traders.  Assuming that a 
trading ship has a life of 50 years, and an average construction time 
of 52 weeks, there will be:

6,163,659 x 50 x 80% = 246 million tons of ships.

Depending on average constuction time, there could be more or less than 
this, and we ought to account for the fact that long Naval ship 
building times mean that more than 20% of the shipyard is probably used 
by the Navy.  However you want to calculate it, I will use a base 
figure of 250 million tons of ships - say 250,000 ships at an average 
of 1000 T each

Ewan has suggested 660 Imperial Navy "big ships"

in addition to the big ships there will be the fighters, escort ships, 
couriers and numerous others ... an average of 10 to 100 x the big 
ships?  let us use 30x to give 20,000 support ships.

World Builders (well, the spreadsheet version I have) gives 1 SDB 
squadron per 10,000,000 people .... around 600 SDB squadron in the 
Spinward Marches - say 12 ships in each at 1000 T?  this gives

7200 SDB at 1000 T each

"I have too much of a spine to flame the works of someone I do not know".

I find that to be a very interesting statement, Leroy.

Perhaps you should start calling up English and Literary Criticism 
departments at universities around the world to give them your opinion.
I\'m sure they\'ll be quite interested in the fact that literary criticism
is essentially the work of men and women without "too much of a spine".

When people post their reviews of products like EV, they\'re reviewing 
the product, not the author. If I said that I didn\'t like EV, or, 
let\'s say, if you said there were faults in the Skyraiders trilogy, 
then we\'d be making comments about a written piece of work, not about 
the relative human worthiness of the products\' respective authors.
By extension, if I, or anyone else, thinks that your review stinks, then
we are free to review the review and say what we like about it. I have
no idea why you think that any sort of review is a personal attack on 
the author.

Quite simply, you have to be trolling. Your statement goes so much 
against the way that reviewers of any sort work that it can\'t possibly
be anything else. It\'s like having me post that I think that real 
men realize that finite element solutions to mechanical engineering
problems are inheritently flawed and that those who avoid closed-form
analytical solutions are without a spine. It\'s just so deeply wrong!

Honestly Leroy, what do you study in school?

<< What do you think of the following modifications to the T4 damage method?

I would suggest the possibility of considering damage for head shots going to
 INT-EDU-DEX...it seems to me after a sharp blow to the head, you might be
dizzy, legs a little rubbery, blurry vision, etc...all things that would seem
best applied to DEX.  Other than that I think it\'s a pretty good idea...

I also think maybe the max damage cap should be at least raised to 4D, if not
done away with altogether...the T4 system is essentially the same as CT, with
some well-needed changes.  Having played CT extensively in High School (with
a group of my JROTC buddies), you can imagine combat was a big part of our
games.  We never seemed to have a real problem the damage done...if your
character was hit with an FGMP-15...he was kitty litter.  No problem.  And,
remember, this was before armor did any reduction to the damage...it only
provided a DM vs. the to-hit roll.

     One of my best-remebered adventures involved a group of characters who
had been captured by a TL-3 society (my discription of them was ca.1780
Redcoats) and besides one character falling in love w/ the then-new Snub
Pistol (w/ HEAP rounds, no less...) by making a perfect head shot with one,
the nasty surprise came to one PC in the form of a .75 cal musket ball...a
bad 5D damage roll, resulting in a prosthetic arm/shoulder for the PC (who
upon returning to the ship, nuked the town...hey we were 15!)

I seem to recall seeing a program on cable TV a few weeks ago that showed
round metal spheres with a groove carved in them...clearly not of natural
origin, that had been found in rock dated at over 1 Billion years old.

And this was located on Earth (obviously), but since it was buried at some
time in the rock, it seems to have been protected from the ravages of time
that way.

BTW...is water so corrosive that it will erode EVERYTHING?  I have heard the
saying "given enough time water will erode a battleship" but aren\'t there
some alloys that will survive extended periods of being underwater?   After
all, 75% of the earth is still unexplored....

I did realize that (at least to the point of knowing that 2 light-hours was
well beyond the 100-d limit anyway) so obviously I guess this would have more
implications in a military situation (i.e. system recon)...but then again, a
good pirate would want to "case"  the system a bit anyway, wouldn\'t he?

Also, (at least in my games anyway) there is usually a fair amount of
in-system
travel...having spent that hard-earned money for Book 6 and MT I might as
well do the extended system generation...some of that would certainly be well
out there.  And I guess I would weigh in on the side of using GG as a
refuelling point for ships not intending to hit the mainworld.

Actually, that stirs a thought also.  Maybe the key to resoving this thread
is to define "Pirate"?  I see everyone discussing piracy as "Arggh, matey,
stand and deliver!", but lets face it...it all seems to come down to the same
thing, destruction or capture of merchant vessels (Commerce raiding)  I doubt
seriously if it matters to a merchant captain if the "pirate" approaching his
ship is an Zhodani or Solomani warship, a privateer from a local system, or
just a bored group of PC\'s w/ nothing better to do!

As far as the system defender goes, in the Trav universe as presented,
anytime a war starts (or military action) the local commander has to fight it
w/ what he has on hand...A war that is one month old means that the only
reinforcements he can get are those w/in a 12 parsec radius (this is absolute
best-case...i.e. J-6 couriers and J-6 response units) A more likely radius
would be 6-8 parsecs, and for M0 it would be 6 parsecs.  

As I see the role of the Imperial Navy (from many different volumes all the
way from CT)  it functions in squadrons or individual ships, based at various
points in a subsector or sector, re-deploying as necessary.  These units are
very high-tech and usually more than a match for the enemy (except in
outright invasion by a major power).  I see the deployment pattern as being
along the lines of the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic period...assigned to
various "stations" and then redeployed from there by the admiral comanding
the station.  In this case...the needed reinforcements might be busy across
the sector!

These tends to keep the idea of SDB\'s alive for me...sure they can\'t stand in
the line-of-battle, but to garrison a system that has SDB\'s requires many
more vessels than it otherwise would...tying up those valuable ships.   And
since they are there anyway...if someone gets frisky in-system they can
usually handle it, I believe.

Obviously, this got far away from my original post about the LS lag, but it
does have some bearing...In my view, "pirates" would be more likely to sieze
the ships, rather than just the cargos.  And knowing if the navy has sent a
Battle Group to the system for "exercises" would be very useful for a raider
of any type...as would the info that the same Battle Group left suddenly
after reports arrived of a Hiver caravan selling corn dogs in another
system...:-)

Anyway, sorry to ramble on...does anyone have any comments/nitpicks/snide
remarks?  :-)

to the main mag\' has been providing supplements detailing the Dagudashaag
Sector - as of this issue that will be complete.

Unfortunately a number of contributors who had promised to supply articles
and adventures for this issue have failed to deliver and our publishing date
has started to drift..

Is there anyone out there who has any decent adventures, port of calls or
articles that they would like to see in print? I can\'t promise any money but
you will receive two copies of the issue and its widely read - I\'ve
subscribers all over the world..

I\'m looking for material that hasn\'t been published before (though I\'m happy
for material that has only been published on the net..)

Please, Please, no highly technical articles working out how many jump drives
can balance on the head of a pin - Traveller is meant to be fun to PLAY.. I
write primarily for Referees and they want something that makes sense but is
ready to run with - Calculators during a session does have this nasty habit
of killing the game in progress. However I would be interested in an article
on system defence and piracy if anyone fancies putting it together.

I hope you can help,

I\'m surprised nobody has mentioned ceramics.

Anyway, several dozen relatively inexpensive markers on geologically stable
airless bodies would just about insure that one would survive a long,
*long* time.  Maybe, place them above or near buried "massicons" that have
no place being where they are...that should get the attention of any
spieces that is exploring their system.

Yeah, I saw part of one on cable recently that purported to expose how the
US Army was using psionics, too.  ;-> 

It\'s fun to speculate, but I won\'t put much credence in either until I see
something in a reputable journal.  However, somebody has got to do the
speculation, investigation, exploration, and experiementation before
anything new gets *in* a reputable journal.

	In my canon he has at least one turn more or less depending on
	view than with the pure light lag.

	when the jump bubble collapse, the stored energy of the HPG
	running for a week accelleration LHy dispension, is tunnelling
	out of the bubble. The "jump explosion at 100 diameters" can be
	seen with blind eyes on a bright day in Sahara. This jump
	explosion will start about half an hour before departure,
	and will ionisize interplanetary dust for at least an other
	half our after depature. Its usual that is warship is using
	this jump explosion for sensor shadow to leave the point
	of depature, and to silently drift towards its real destination.

	About how bright a jump explosinion of a TL:A, 100dt Jump1 ship
	is : 16.2MW*24*7 = 383 MW about 600 Gjoule, thats bigger than
	any particle accellerator. A jump 4 ship will produce a jump

	What about a more "scientific approach" and asking why the
	empire needed this expensive trade.

	My answer : The diversity of products is increasing with
	the techlevel, and only a larger synergy of systems can
	build a techlevel higher than its own sustainable techlevel.

	The minimum population for a techlevel is

		(10^TechLevel)/(2^MaintModifier)

	where MaintModifier is 

		Tl 4-5:2, Tl 6-7:3, Tl 8-9:4, Tl A-C:5,
		Tl D-F:6, Tl G-I:8, Tl J-L:10,Tl M+:12

	So high tech worlds rely on import for maintaince and export
	for paying the imports. 

	E.G: Usdiki A260985-E has a popmod of 8. about 8000 million humans

	I\'m now asuming that 1/8th of the production is TL:E, so the
	Tl:E capital is 37 kCr * 10^9, the maintaince is 0.4% per
	month 148 GCr half of the maintaince is done by the heavy
	industry localy, leaving 74 GCr for spare parts.

	(D-9)=5, so 50% of those spare parts have to come from offworld
	trade. That are 37 GCr minimum trade just for sustaining technology
	without any luxus import like bananas and coffee for the people
	or low tech toys for the kids. The real import/export will be
	about 10 to 20 times higher, because its often cheaper to import
	than to build it from scratch. btw:The monthly GNP for Usdiki
	would be 15TCr, so the Import/Export factor in the GNP is
	about 0.2% to 4% depending on how much of the trade is for
	pure luxus.

	When using this theory most economies in the wilds collapsed BEFORE
	virus arived, so you can see main virus populations only in Core,
	Vland, Rure and Ilish the former save areas in the rebellion.

	This theory also explains why the Sylean had to expand before
	archiving TL:D (Antebellum around 400-600) and how big the
	Sylean trade was when the 3I was founded (about 200 billion
	people, 10 popcod A worlds, 2-5 subsectors) It would also
	explain why Vilani were Tl:A- (most of their worlds had
	popcods of 6 or 7) and Sol was able to build TL:C (Terra
	was overpopulated probately popcod B popmod 2-3) very fast.

	At the lower techlevels the numbers seem quite resonable to me,
	even if I dont have a PhD in economics, but in computer science.

I work for the NYC PD; I know whereof I speak.

The population of the City of New York proper (not including the
suburban areas included in the Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area for census purposes) is nine million, and during
the typical business day, you can expect to find ten to twelve
million people within the confines of the city.

A rookie police officer, fresh out of the Academy, makes $30,000
per year; the average officer of non-appointed rank has five to
eight years on the job and makes $48,000 per year.

Effective October of 1996, when the NYC PD fully absorbed the
formerly independent New York City Housing Police Department and
the New York City Transit Police Department, the uniformed
strength of the department, all ranks from Chief of Department on
down, including Detective and investigative ranks, was 35,000.
An additional 8,000 to 10,000 non-uniformed ("civilian")
personnel carry out some administrative and maintenance tasks at
an average salary of $28,000 per year.

The New York City Police Department has officers on-duty 24 hours
per day, 365 days per year (366 in leap years).  There are 76
Patrol precincts, 9 Housing Police Service Areas, 12 Transit
Police Districts, 8 Borough Commands, 4 Highway Patrol Units,
and about a dozen specialized patrol and investigative units such
as Mounted, Aviation, Internal Affairs, Organized Crime Control,
Intelligence, Narcotics, and so on.

The busiest precincts (I work in one such) can expect to have an
average at any moment of the day of 100 members of the service of
all ranks and titles including civilians in administrative
positions scheduled to work per square mile of patrol area.  Of
those, one can expect roughly seven to ten percent to be actually
unavailable due to unexpected illness or family emergencies,
court testimony, special details, vacation, restricted duty due
to pending administrative disciplinary action or psychological
conditions leading to temporary removal of authority to carry a
firearm, and so on.

If _every_ cop were to be placed on the street doing foot patrol,
at the density implied by the figures for the busiest precincts
above, you could have one cop every roughly 500 feet.  The area
of the City of New York (all five boroughs) is roughly 325 square
miles, requiring a total of more than 32,000 _foot_patrol_only_
officers to have them at intervals of _500_ feet throughout the
city.  That\'s an average of one per two short blocks in
Manhattan.  To have them every _15_ feet, as you suggest, would
require a total of roughly 40.25 MILLION patrol officers;
assuming a rookie salary of $30,000 per year for each of them,
that would cost the city $1.2 TRILLION (US Trillion; British
Billion; power-of-ten exponent is 12).  The budgeted
expenditures, for _all_ programs, of the United States Government
in 1992 was $1.4 trillion.

New York City cannot afford to put a cop every fifteen feet
throughout the city.  The United States could barely afford to
put one cop every fifteen feet throughout New York City -
provided it were willing to forego just about every other program
it runs, including national defense, and fire the people
involved.

Is the material you are looking for similar to what appeared in early JTAS,

   Note to TML members other than Leroy: From time to time, Leroy feels
the need to send messages such as this one in an effort to mend fences
with people he believes he can convince in the future to defend him from
flaming when he pisses off one or more other list members.  It is a
technique he employed from time to time on HIWG-list.

   Horse crap.  I\'ve met Dave Nilsen and Loren Wiseman and I would have
no trouble saying publically and to their *face* that the TNE supplement
"Aliens of the Rim, Vol. 1" was interesting piece of experimental RPG
sourcebook writing that promptly fell on its face.  In short, nice try
guys, better luck next time.  This is not to say that Dave Nilsen or
Loren Wiseman are bad writers, or that there aren\'t parts of the book
that *do* work (much of the book is very valuable).  Conversely, Loren
had some problems with the write-up I did on the Vegans that appeared in
Traveller Chronicle and he felt free to tell me so.

   This does provide some insight however--could it be that because
"Marc Miller\'s Traveller" is named for Marc Miller, and Leroy knows Marc
Miller, that Leroy is incapable of giving a critical review of any MMT
product?  Highly likely I would argue.

>So naturally I had to clear the air first, I do have some basic

   This is another standard Leroy tactic: address a post to a particular
member of the list, include insults of other people, and then send the
post to the list.

>I am not surprised to see that Doug would go that way, but you too?  I

   Ditto.

   Ditto.

   You get the idea.  Even when he is supposedly being consolatory, he
isn\'t.  And wasn\'t this the guy who said he wasn\'t going to respond to
this thread anymore?

   ObTrav: In the future, I will try to include at least some morsel of
Traveller content in all my posts.  Looking back on my last few to this
list, it seems I\'m either addressing historical references or snake
hunting.  I\'ll try to do a little less of each in the future.

   I\'m curious where everyone thinks Traveller will be in the year
2001.  The beginning of the 21st century afterall, a mere four years
away.  Will MMT still be around in version "T4.4"?  Will GURPS:
Traveller be Traveller?  Will there be a revival of TNE?  What will the
fan base look like (will there be one?)?  I\'ve already done my share of
predicitions on this list, I\'m curious what other people think.

Unfortunately this makes the figures much less useful to those of us who
likes to keep as close as possible to the official Traveller universe. I
guess you missed the reply where I pointed out to Douglas that pop code
ranges goes from 1*10^code to just under 1*10^code+1 (ie. Pop code 4 has
a range of 1000 to 9999).

If the technology is realistic then hiding in outer space is impossible.
Any ship will generate heat and getting rid of the heat is very difficult.
And even with present day technology heat can be detected a long way off.
Stealth technology can hide just who and what you are, but it can\'t
conceal that _something_ is there.

(Personally I\'d love to see a \'cloaking device\', but I know a lot of the
more technically minded people on this list will want to skin me alive
for even suggesting it ;-).

Piracy appears to be the concern of the navy. There are examples of the
navy taking over small worlds and replacing their governments when they
were exposed as pirate havens.

>Just how much of the presumed 5% of GWP that goes to the military goes
>to the IN?  How do the subsector and planetary forces fit in?

The rule in TCS is that the various navies (that is, army not included)
gets Cr500 per citizen. _Striker_ gives the navy and army together from

the army recieving 40% of this (that is, 28% of the original figure) on
worlds with a breathable admothsphere and only 6% on vacuum worlds. The
other 30% goes to the interstellar state (the Imperium further subdivides

Transponders are supposed to be tough to tamper with, though there are
canonical examples of fake transponders (in contradiction to what TNE
claims about the deyo based transponder). There should be no problems
making up authentic looking papers. (The trouble is that using papers
that don\'t correspond to the official records will mark you out for
attention.)

If you can get your hands on them in the first place you can almost
certainly find someone to take them off your hands. From books and
TV shows I\'ve gained the impression that most hot stuff fetches from
10 to 20% of its real value. A starship would propably lie in the low
end of that range.

But... from your original post:

You have crippled the ship (victim) in 5 minutes: The easiest way to do
this is to kill the power plant, so no gravity... Otherwise the merchant
captain, knowing that the SDB is (in your argument) 85 min out puts the
ship in a deadmans tumble so you can\'t recover it.

But in all the Traveller Ship Combat systems I\'ve played that takes at
least 30 min an exchange....and the SDB is coming in fast. Yes, I agree you
point about the guard, but gunners are hired by merchant captains for this
type of operation and the merchant may have a lot of his money tied up in
hs savings. They\'d put up some resistance especially if they think an SDB
is within an hour and a half of them.

You misunderstand me - the system failure is induced by fire from (a)
pissed off merchant or (b) the approaching SDB.

Re-reading the original post you sent I believe that your original
hypothesis (crippling the ship in 5 min) is flawed. I am basing my position
on loading of isofrieghts at work.

I grew up there, and found them, in the main, polite, reasonable, and
fairly rational to the same extent that people in New Jersey and northern
and sourthern California are.  I presume they are roughly the same in these
traits as people from any other plaace you care to sample - people share
more common traits than they difer in, though the expression mechanism does
vary the farther you go from this country\'s shores and the television
system that did an awful lot of socialization of the current generation.

aceptable.  My own perception diagrees)

see on the mission-control screens (at least in the movies) [even though it\'s
taken you 90 minutes to make a complete revolution, sorry, the Earth has
turned 90 minutes worth: ~1500 miles at the equator.]

The only way you could have a craft be exactly over your head would be if you
are on the equator and the craft is orbiting on the equatorial plane (which
you might as well make geosynchronous) or at a pole with the craft orbiting
to cross the poles.  Otherwise the best you might hope for is along the same
longitude (slightly increasing or decreasing the time of "orbit" according to
if the craft is orbiting in the direction of the planet\'s rotation or against
it) or at odd times when it might be somewhere within line of sight of the
landing party.

Why dodge away from them when you could dodge straight into them? I doubt
the Death Star would take any noticeable damage from doing so, while there
probably would not be any noticeable pieces left of the X-wings.

This brings up a question: If two ships collide, how much damage is done to
each of them? The smaller ship would take more damage, but ...

I was thinking of possible kamikaze attacks, or even destroyer ships driving
straight into disabled small enemy fighters. Has anyone ever used a system
for these kinds of things?

Note: I am using the T4 rules. Any information would be helpful though.

I\'m starting to think about writing an article on this someday (although I\'d
be much more likely to do so if I thought I could get it published for money
somewhere...How is JTAS doing, anyway?) 

The reader\'s digest version is that both sensors tell you the position 
of a target. PEMS tell you (if you see it in the IR) how much power
its power plant is putting out; with more time and good sensor operator
work you learn what kind of IR masking it has, roughly how big the ship is,
and various signatures that could allow you to look the ship up in your
big-book-o-IR-signatures and ID the class. If you see it in the visible
you learn roughly how big the ship is and (again with long exposure) some
clues to rough shape that might let you ID the class.

AEMS give you a very precise range (even including range to different parts
of the ship, which your computer can turn into a rough picture of the
target.) 

At short ranges (50,000km or less) you start to see details in the ship\'s
hull - your PEMS gives you a (blurry) picture of the target. At moderate
amounts of effort you can also use this to ID the target. At very short
ranges (5,000km or less) you can read the name on the hull. FFS2 has a nice
table giving the resolutions (size of details) sensors can see at a given
range.

My private interpretation would be that the people live in some ancient
installation that they no longer understand. Perhaps the colonists still
have functioning automatic systems (like air cleaners etc.) but they do no
longer understand them. In that case they would live within their artificial
world, and they would probably be seriously shocked if someone from the
outside entered.

At that tech level, it is even quite possible that they refer to the
one-time creators of their world as Gods In that case they would probably
regard visitors as Gods too, and perhaps humbly ask them to help with some
difficult problem.

Just giving you some ideas that suddenly appeared in my head ...

The actual duration (as perceived by a static observer in normal space) is
one week, and I think the time perceived by the crew of the ship is the=
 same.

This would mean that if a jump takes longer than one week (due to a misjump)
the captain would get VERY embarassing questions from the passengers.

You\'ve just invented the "photon torpedo" from ST. ;->

Actually, why have a dense matter core, just crash the torpedo into the
target and when the magnetic confinement chamber collapes the AM will
interact directly with it.

>What would the dammage of this weapon be if it could be built?

E=mc2, or there abouts. 

Wouldn\'t that be 1.8e17 ergs per gram of antimatter?  2 x (3e8)^2

If so, then that converts to 18,000Mj/gram?  1.8e17 / 1e13

Or did I do that wrong? ;->

BTW, how many joules does a ton of TNT produce?

I would guess that about your only chance would be to look for a local
store that sells used software.  Although for something this old, even this
route isn\'t very promising.  The only other thing I can think of is to post
a "WTB" in the applicable USENET newsgroups.

The antimatter converts itself and it\'s own mass of normal matter into pure
energy. This means that the torpedo would destroy first of all the weight of
it\'s antimatter charge.

This is VERY minor, though ...

The energy created by this conversion would be enormous. If you converted
one promille of a metric kg, you would get roughly 90 terajoule of energy,
which can blow lots of things to pieces, or, more likely, disintengrate=
 them.

I would strongly advice against being somewhere near the impact point. Even
being within the line of sight (which is very far away, in space) would be
potentially disastrous, as much of the energy would escape as radiation.
This would fry ANYONE being to close pretty quick.

I also agree that an explanation of this kind of tech stuff would be very

I think a supplement detailing the various technological terms in Traveller
would be very handy. I even think that many of the people here on this list
would be qualified to write such a book.

Makes me go, "Yeah sure!" ;->

Forgive me if I remain somewhat skeptical about billion year old human
footprints.  So are we talking about a timetraveller who leaves her
footprint in the sand, or an alien with similar footprints deciding to take
a barefooted walk?  I think I\'d find either of those explanations more
plausible than humans and trilobites being contemporaneous.

I\'ve just worked out why in B5 mass drivers were outlawed by every
civilised race. The mere mention of them caused such incredible flame wars
on the widely popular traveller mailing lists of the future  that whole
intersteller computer networks were shut down. 

Or maybe JMS said they were outawed as a joke.... (is he secretly a TML
member?)

Damn those Cetauri...... don\'t they have access to the TML?

Has anyone read the Minbari version of Traveller? I hear that there
favourite character is Vilani, and that they play a variant where thew
Vilani Empire soundly kicked the snot out of the Terran Confederation........


......... then surrendered to them at the last minute!

I completely agree with you Andrew (hence the shout up there).  The fact
that one would be working or unemployed is of no relevance ultimately to
the quality of a product that you wish to purchase.  The price the product
is sold in relation to the quality of that product is relevant.

Have you compared the book Jovian Chronicles from Dream Pod 9?  Even though
I am not into Anime, this is one of the best game product I have ever seen.
It is everything T4 supplements should be.

I buy a product so that it will make my referreing (is that the word?)
easier, not make me more frustrated.  101 Vehicles was fantastic for that. 
I could simply open the book and use it.  Much of my gaming sessions are
improvised, I do not have the time to figure out things like how much fuel
goes into a vehicle.  Furthermore, I don\'t want to make them run out of
fuel just because it is good for the plot.  If my players are intelligent
enough to check the fuel, I want to tell them how much is left.  The book
Emperor\'s Vehicle (I browsed through it but did not buy it (I might not buy
it even though I have a good job (I don\'t throw away money))) feels
unfinished.  It looks like stuff was left out of it.  There is no good
reason why the TL was not included.  There is no good reason why the rest
of the information (which must be generated anyway) was left out.

I do own some of the T4 supplements (I feel it is important to encourage
IG), but I didn\'t buy the useless ones (First Survey comes to mind).  I
will not buy the unfinished material.

At this point in time, I am really looking forward to Gurps Traveller just
for the quality of the products from SJG (I still don\'t like the Gurps
system).  I really hope to be able to adapt them for my campaign.

got to post something to incite hatred amongst TML members...

1) The whole EV flame thing....

 I for one vote that sender\'s names should appear at the end of postings
so readers can digest the material before pressing the flame button after
seeing the name \'Leroy\' or \'Douglas\' etc.. etc.. at the start :|

 On a more specific note, my steadfast requirements for good RPG material
are that
  a) the book in question must do something that I can\'t do quickly or
     *accurately* that fits in within the roughly defined canon of the
     RPG\'s universe and
  b) it inspires me in a way particular to the RPG system in question
     (whoops getting all conceptual and fuzzy here) and
  c) It took a lot of hard work to produce the product.

EV meets point c by all indications but requirement a & b are looking a
little undernourished.

 In short a book of vehicles, some illustrated with a rough description
and the odd stat that wasn\'t screened out in the printing process - ;) -
might do for Vampire, but for Traveller that falls short of many
expectations.

 I ask, what is sooo outstanding and awe-inspiring about the
\'highly-acclaimed\' Emperor\'s Vehicles that makes it the most \'advanced\'
and \'contemporary\' (A word used in place of \'modern art\' or \'unskilled
crap that artists claim is based on a \'concept\' to back up the fact that
they\'re work is a piece of sh*t that took 2 minutes and a piece of string
to compose but they don\'t care because they\'ll get paid heaps for it
anyway\' in my dictionary)?       

 EV was not done with a piece of string in two minutes on a \'concept\' so
why use that argument to back it up? Hmmm? I\'m not trying to attack the
book itself (although It certainly appears so) just the vague and
conteporary reasons and answers offered to explain a few simple mistakes
away as \'revolutionary design concepts\'. I\'d like to hear the author\'s
real explanation on his or her (just being politically correct :P) choice
of format, not defensive \'experience backed\' hot air.

 Everyone is guilty of the \'he/she\'s picking on person x so let\'s get
him/her\' syndrome and some jump straight into the \'trolling\' nets set up
by others so let\'s just relax, ignore previous jibes and see if we can get
along... people have a tendency to pick on something on the other side of
the world because they know they can walk away at the end of the day and
not be held accountable for their actions... 

phew... <sound of escaping steam> 


2) About the anti-\'Aliens of the Rim\' thing...

What do people acutally dislike about AOTR1 to brand it a flop?

Not being bred on CT or MT alien books myself it came as a pleasant
suprise to acutally find something that explained an alien race in more
than two sentences (Your looking at a guy that is soooo inexperienced and 
behind in the Traveller universe that he bought MT in 1992 and TNE this
year, hence any futher comments by myself may be declared void and
irrelevent). 

Ok, back to the point... Apart from the slightly obscure prose in some
sections and the Santa Claus references (aw but the Ithklur look sooo
cuuute!) how different (and apparently inferior) is it to the original
Hiver book (there was one, wasn\'t there?)?

Any additional backround notes that can be pointed out to me will be much
appreciated to give me the most complete picture of Hivers possible.

Yes that\'s right folks its m. ac time!

The new head of the Imperial Navy in the Spinward Marches, Sector
Admiral Frederick Santanocheev, announced his first major move
yesterday. Surprisingly, it is a political endeavor rather than a
military one.

Santanocheev declared that he is forming a counterpart to the Naval
Intelligence department. The Office of Naval Information will be a
complementary organization and the two organizations are expected to
cooperate fully on missions and intelligence-sharing objectives. When
asked the purpose behind the new department, a spokesperson for
Santanocheev stated that the Naval Intelligence department needs a more
objective viewpoint from time to time. The new organization would serve
that goal.

Santanocheev became Sector Admiral last month. The former Rear Admiral
is in Aramis on his way to Regina to confer with Duke Norris.

I hear a lot of examples of "modern piracy" being quoted on the list. I do
not doubt their veracity. But I wonder -- is it really a good parallel? Do
modern pirates hijack big freighters? You know, the really expensive ones?
I mean, even a small starship in Traveller is really expensive.

Pirates who own a multi-million credit starship and have to maintain it
would have to have a high overhead, wouldn\'t they?

I don\'t know if the analogy of small boat pirating is any better than crime
in NYC.

I suspect that I was responsible for that. Way back in season 1, when
the traffic was something I could manage, I was on the B5 newsgroup.
And during a discussion on what war might be like when it eventually
occured, I went into my usual overwhelming detail about what "throwing
rocks" could do.

Better recheck the plaque on that display. As I recall, a billion years
ago it was strictly single cell organisms. The big explosion in
multicellular forms was about 600 million years ago.

BTW, ever notice how much a horsehoe crab resembles a trilobite? :-)

You can set the ship to spinning about any axis. But only one of them

   It wasn\'t necessarily the material included so much as the attitude. 
OK, the baseball and Santa Claus references (and the explanation for
them) didn\'t work, but there really is some good content.  Dave Nilsen\'s
essay at the back, basically saying that aliens are nothing more than
humans in rubber suits was particularly misplaced and inappropriate
(imagine if you will George Lucas coming on the screen during Star Wars,
just before the scene in the temple where Luke, Han and Chewie get their
medals, to tell everyone that the spacecraft used in the film were
really just models, that stormtrooper armor is really plastic, and
everything used in the film is fake).  He really should have saved it
for a Challenge editorial or some other venue.

   You would also like DGP\'s alien books, which covered the Vilani and
Vargr in one volume, and the Solomani and Aslan in the other (another
volume covering the Zhodani and Droyne never happened, neither did one
for the K\'kree and Hivers).  Very richly detailed, even if they strayed
a little here and there from canon.  The original alien modules from GDW
were also excellent, and covered one race at a time.

   If you can find any of these, they are worth every penny you\'re
likely to pay for them.

   Here\'s what we do around these parts with AotR, v.1: the Hiver stuff
is treated as pretty accurate, with the interjections by the Ithklur
taken as one being\'s humble opinion (OBHO?).  His comments may or may
not be true depending upon how you want to structure your campaign.  As
for the Ithklur section, well let\'s just say if you cut out all the 20th
century references it\'s salvagable.

>Any additional backround notes that can be pointed out to me will be much
>appreciated to give me the most complete picture of Hivers possible.

   You might want to check some of the many Traveller Web sites that are
out there if you can\'t lay your hands on the older publications.  There
are a considerable amount of essays, adventures, etc. derived from them
and it will give you a feel for what the original intent was for the
Hivers.

infrequently, is necessary.

Put a highport at the 100 dia point would solve that - but even if the odds 
are astronomical, would you risk a multi Bcr starport out where some idiot 
may emerge from jump?  The furthest out I would place it would be in the 70

Why bother moving from the jump point?

Also, given the "canonical" shipping of resource type items around
(don\'t get me started on why anybody with fusion reactors won\'t bother
shipping ores and refined metals around), you should also see *huge*
bulk carriers visiting "mining worlds".

I had my game tonight (particularly exciting, I might add, and I might
even write one of those share-the-game-with-everyone-stories that so
many of us enjoy if I find time), and two questions came up that I
thought would be good for list discussion.

Since I can\'t receive mail, I\'ve been checkin\' out the TML archives to
keep up with everything.



QUESTION #1:  Interstellar space.

We had a discussion about Interstellar space--specifically, where does
the jurisdiction line fall between planetary governments and the
Imperium?

Does the planet run the whole system, or is it more like the 200 mile
border around the US to international waters?

I winged it tonight, stating to my players that every system is
different, then I made a mental note to bring this up on the list and
see how other GMs play this.

What\'s the standard in the Imperium?  Tonight, I thought of two good
answers.  First, I thought that one hex in space combat would be a good
rule of thumb, giving a planet an "airspace" of 30,000 KM.  Beyond that,
it\'s the Imperium\'s balliwick.

Then I thought of something more natural to Traveller--the 10 diameter
limit.  So, for right now, I\'m thinking that the 10 diam limit  is a
good distance to distinguish between Imperial and planetary
jurisdiction.

This came up in the game because the players were ordered to leave
Pysadi.  They got in the Harrier, left the planet, then wanted to get
beyond the planet\'s jurisdiction and just sit there--not really leaving
the system.  They wanted to get in "international waters" so to speak,
where the Pysadian officials could not force them to leave.

So, what are your thoughts on this?



QUESTION #2.  Actually, a comment.

In tonight\'s game, the law of the "crafty player" came up, raising an
eyebrow on this Traveller veteran.

They were trying to get out of "Pysadian space" into "international
waters" as soon as possible, so I (having picked the 10 diam mark as the
jurisdiction line) popped out the travel chart from MT, cross referenced
Pysadi\'s size (4) with the Harrier\'s M-Drive (1G), and promptly stated,
"This will take you 1.3 hours."

Then, the crafty player of the night said, "Those times in that table
are calculated using the travel formula, correct?"

I said, "yes".

"OK," crafty player continued, "and the travel formula is based on
accelerating at full thrust for half the trip, then using the rest of
the trip to decelerate?"

I said yes again, not know where crafty player was taking this.

"Well,"  he said, "we want to get there as fast as we can--so we don\'t
want to decelerate.  For time calculation purposes, let\'s double the
distance and halve the time to see how long it will take us to get to
that point at full thrust all the way."

I\'ve been playing Traveller for a decade and a half, and this has just
never come up.  Funny how that happens like this sometimes, isn\'t it?

He was right.  You double the distance (double Pysadi\'s size 4 world to
a size 8, then halve the time on the chart to see how long it will take
to get to the jurisdiction line without decelerating).

How many times in the past can this maneuver have been used?  You could
use it for the planet to jump point calculation--and reenter space from
jump already moving at a good speed--decreasing travel time by several
hours on each end.

Maybe you other GMs out there do this type of stuff all the time, but
I\'ve always relied on using the tables or using the travel formula.

I\'m just flabbergasted that I never realized the travel time savings
that could be had this way.

Kenneth.

Might I suggest to all and sundry (as i have previously) that you write to SJG
and let them know what you want?

I have suggested that there is no reason why we could not at least *wish* for a
hardcover book, perhaps with all glossy paper, as per "In Nomine" ... and if
enough people email them, well, we just might get it!

One local software store in Sheffield, England has several copies of 
MT1 at bargain-bucket prices (UK pounds 5, IIRC) so the game is still 
out there... I also have a CD version of MT1 and MT2 together which 
might still be available somewhere.

I am not recommending you ask me to buy for you -- the currency 
conversion and postage would be much greater than the price of the 
game, I fear -- but to encourage you that the products are still out 
there...

As noted elsewhere (on another topic) the rule of thumb is that at 3
km/sec an impact is equivalent to setting off the same mass of TNT. The
energy goes up with the square of the speed. So if a fighter that
masses a mere 10 tons impacts on your destroyer at a relative velocity
of 21 km/sec (pretty low by Traveller standards) it\'d be equivalent to
(21/3)^2 * 10 = 490 tons of TNT going off (a half-kiloton nuke!).

I don\'t think ramming is a good idea...

Well, while I still maintain that a lot of things people want "defined"
*can\'t* be (due to the vagueness of the rules), I\'m willing to help try
to define the rest.

So how about some folks out there who want definitions, post some
messages with Subject: "Definition: xxxx", and us "techy" types can try
defining them. Then the "non-techy" types can let us know what they
want more details about, and what they feel isn\'t needed.

After a few go-rounds, we should have something worthy of saving. If we
do enough, somebody might even be able to collect them into a book. :-)

You don\'t use a speaker. You use a transducer. You can buy that sort of
thing at Radio Shlock. Clamp it to the floor and it turns the floor
into a speaker.

Actually, it has multiple uses. The pulse will travel through the
structure of the hull as well as through any gas or liquid that may be
inside the next compartment. So any survivors will hear the pulses thru
the hull before you get to them. Possibly quite a few compartments
away, even if the surrounding compartments are airless.

The gizmo monitoring the pulse echoes will be a form of TDR (Time
Domain Reflectometer). Ones using electrical pulses are used for things
like finding breaks in cables. They\'ll also detect taps. :-)

With decent computer power (a given at the likely TLs) it should be
able to tell you whether there is liquid or gas in the compartment, and
a general idea of the pressure if it is gas.

20% requires a special cicumstance of some sort. 10% is standard. And
"easily identified" items can get you less than 1% (I know someone who
has been known to handle goods of "questionable" origin from time to
time :-)


BTW, one interesting fact (from some articles on art thefts). Most
"big" thefts of things like art objects are a failure for the theives.
Unless you have some crazy collector already lined up before you steal
it, you have essentially *no* chance of selling the Mona Lisa. If you
find a fence who is willing to take it off your hands, you\'ll be lucky
to get a few thousand from him.

There are two general outcomes for art thefts. First, (and most
desirable) is that the theives realize that they\'ve got a white
elephant and find a way to return it anonymously. The second outcome is
bad for everybody. Upon discovering that the artwork is essentially
worthless to them, they destroy it... <argghh!>

Ships will have *some* similarities to cars as far as disposing of
stolen parts goes. But not enough. There aren\'t likely to be *nearly*
enough of any given model produced. So the parts are too readily
identfiable. The smaller (and hence more likely to be standardized)
parts aren\'t likely to be worth as much.

So stolen ships (as opposed to "mortgage jumpers") are either going to
be used by the theives (pirates hijacking an armed freighter to use as
their ship) or are going to have to be moved to another jurisdiction to
be sold (as "salvage").

The former is going to be most common inside the Imperium and any other
*large* interstellar government. The latter will be more common near
the borders, and in areas with lots of small governments.

Alas, antimatter may turn out to be a lot less useful as a weapon than
people used to think.

To start with, while positron/electron pairs produce "pure energy"
(gamma rays) anti-protons or anti-neutrons reacting with normal matter
produce a lot of mesons of various sorts. This is because
electrons/positrons are fundamental particles, but neutrons/protons and
their antiparticles are composite particles. They are made up of three
quarks. And the usual result is that *one* of the quarks gets
destroyed, leaving two behind. Two quark particles are mesons. The
mesons decay in various ways, spreading out the damage in both space
and time.

Also, it\'s thought that the very *violence* of a matter/antimatter
reaction will slow things down. The result is likely to resemble a drop
of water skittering around on a hot griddle more than the massiver
explosion you\'d expect. 

Contact with a solid object would blast the antimatter away. Contact
with a liquid or gas would result in the liquid/gas reaching the
antimatter in small dribs and drabs as the energy released keeps
pushing it away. 

So to get a "good" reaction instead of this silly "sputtering" (which
is *still* dangerous and destructive), you want the antimatter to hit
the planet at a speed such that the blast on contact won\'t do more than
slow it up a bit.

This would result in the antimatter (and the matter it hits) being
converted to plasma by the impact, and the antimatter plasma still
driving downward due to its momentum. This should give a *very* good
mix, and a nice blast as large amounts of material react.

This is quite similar to the problem nuclear bombs have. They have to
have either massive confinement *or* an implosion wave using the
inertia of the fissionables to keep the fissionables close enough
together long enough for a good "bang". If you just take two pieces of
slightly more than half a critical mass each and bring them together,
you\'ll get a small blast (about blasting cap/pipe bomb size) and a lot
of radiation as they throw themselves apart. 

Without doing any calculations, I\'d expect that the "ideal" impact
velocity for an antimatter warhead is something up around 1% of c...

But if you insist on humans, there are several possibilities that can
used. Several "corrosive" atmospheres can be dealt with by "protective
suits" which are actually buildable at TL1. The *idea* isn\'t TL1, but
the required materials can be manufactured and assembled at that level.

Say the problem is a high level of sulfur dioxide/trioxide or nitrogen
oxides (essentially sulfuric or nitric acid vapors). This can be
protected against by cloth suits impregnated with rubber, and
headpieces with glass eyes. The air you breathe is drawn thru a tank of
water containing lye or some other strong base. That neutralizes the
acid fumes. The air you exhale goes out thru a spring loaded valve. 

The villages or towns (I doubt they have cities) mostly generate their
own air using greenhouses (lots of small ones, so that an accident
doesn\'t kill all the plants). Water can be purified by treating with
limestone (which gives you saltwater) and then distilling (probably in
solar stills).

I\'d guess that the acidic atmosphere is relatively new or else things
like limestone would be really hard to find (rain would dissolve it
like sugar). For sulfur oxides, best bet is *massive* volcanic
activity. For Nitrogen oxides, best bet is a genetic engineering
project (or even a natural mutation) of nitrogen fixing bacteria gone
wrong.

The volcanic activity would tend to cause some major side effects that
you may not want. The nitrogen fixing bacteria scenario works ok. You
can check out a book by Hal Clement ("The Nitrogen Fix") that has
something similar happen to earth.

Either way, the people may be the descendants of a colony from before
the change. It took most of their resources for survival at first, so
they lost a lot of "non-essential" tech.

I expect that all the towns/villages will be on volcanic rock (most
resistant to acid) and mostly in places where the volcanic rock
overlays a limestone deposit. Prefereably places where the limestone
deposit is completely covered by the volcanic rock (granite, basalt,
that sort of thing). 

That gives them protection, but at the same time access to the
limestone they need for acid neutralization. Most of the dwellings and
storage areas will be cut into the limestone, with only the greenhouses
and certain "industrial" work areas outside.

To crib a plot line from ST:TNG (who cribed it from Niven I think). Assuming
that the aliens have a reasonable biotech, why not encode it in the DNA
sequences of some local life forms. Sharks would be a good bet, or jellyfish.
Remember something like 90% of any DNA sequence is just waste space.

    'body' => 'This thought was inspired by a turn in the piracy thread -
ie how is cargo secured in your freighter and how do you shift it.

The following thoughts may be totally impractical -
but I only program computers:-)

Securing a cargo with webbing straps is okay for loose stuff and tarpaulins, 
but I have always seen Traveller cargo as containerised, with the standard 
container containing any special features (such as air con, refrigeration, 
grav, anti-grav...) These containers would be sealed by the cargo owner 
(presumably in the presence of source world customs) and opend by the
receiver 
(presumably in the presence of destination world customs) and the merchant 
captain would not be allowed to open them between times (although might still 
be responsible for the contants.)

Working near one of the UK\'s largest container ports, I noticed that a 
container is not just a box - attached to each corner is a 6" steel cube. The 
bottom of the four cubes attached to the bottom of the container each has a 
hole which locates the container securely on whatever is carrying it (the 
truck, train, whatever, has four supports - each with a dowel in the centre
to 
locate the container). I assume that the cubes on the top of the container
also 
have dowels to allow stacking. On the sides of the cubes are slots that I 
believe are used by cranes to lift the containers.

So how does this work in 3I?

The first level of containers are moved into place on the cargo floor. Then 
four locating pins engage with suitable slots in the corners of the
containers. 
In order to avoid problems if the grav is turned off in the cargo bay, these 
pins would firmly attach the container to the floor from within the slot.

Additional containers could be attached to the top of the first layer of 
containers in the same manner.

Although some people seem to want to creep around stacks of containers in RPG 
sessions (in a dark cargo hold, something lurks...) I would imagine that all 
the containers would be packed tightly together, fully interlocked with
each of 
its 6 adjacent containers (or wall or ceiling or floor) to avoid problems
if a 
locking pin fails.

If you load the container in sideways, the door at the end will be against a 
wall or another container, so unless there is explosive inside, there are no 
Trojan horse scenarios and the ship captain can only get in if the cargo
bay is 
not full or some containers are moved outside the ship.

(Following from recent steps with aircraft containers due to bombs onboard, I 
would imagine that the containers are designed to contain quite large 
explosions without rupturing).

Loading would be computer controlled to ensure that containers are loaded in 
optimal order, presumably by some combination of linear induction motors and 
contra grav in the cargo hold to place each container before the locking pins 
are engaged.

Loading and unloading by computer control would be very fast (less than 1 
minute per container).

Without computer control, you could do it by hand if you can disengage the 
locking pins and turn off the gravity.

If you can\'t disengage the locking pins, its a week in the shipyard 
disassembling the ship from around the containers (or at least crawling
around 
all the access ways to get to the pins locking the containers to floor, wall 
and ceiling.

It would be slightly easier if the ship was not fully loaded.

there are about 3000 SDBs on the map, but a couple of worlds accound for
almost all of them and most worlds are undefended.

One thing I remember from the game is that you do *not* attack the Zhos
battleships with your SDBs - you get them hiding in the oceans or gas giants
or lurking as asteroids and then they must either leave behind a large
covering force or you can regain control of the system at any time and
block their supplies and reinforcements (and reduce their VPs).

Under this scheme, an SDB fleet is of no more use against pirates than
a nuclear submarine is today.

Of course you don\'t have to use all your SDB\'s in this way, but since they
can\'t escape from the system its very risky for your opponents to know
your SDB deployments because you use them for anti-piracy. If they are 
uncertain then they either use too big a covering force and the attack
runs out of ships, or too small and their supply fleets are destroyed,
or they must divert forces to convoying.

An object set off heading for our solar system from, say Alpha Centauri,
would not get there until a very long time had passed. This object would be
timed to drift into the solar system at some point in history. Since this
would be impossible to determine beforehand, the generous aliens would have
to send objects at slightly different velocities, thus making them appear
with regular intervals in our solar system. At some point in history, the
objects would probably be picked up and examined. This is even more probable
if they contained small solar-powered radio transmitters, making them very
easy to detect.

The objects would not be destroyed by the ravages of time. This (although
reversed) is part of the plan with the Voyager satelites, the first of which
is currently leaving our solar system. In MANY thousands of years it will
enter another solar system, possibly getting noticed (or so NASA hopes). It
carries a plaque of some platinum alloy (I beleive) with pictures of humans
and the solar system etched into it.

Heh, this reminds me of the Python sketch in which the Mob was selling 
\'Insurance\' to the military.

"Nice Tigress  you got here Admiral, be a shame if anything were 
to..."happen" to it.   I mean...things "break" don\'t they?"

Which makes me wonder how organized crime would operate in Traveller.  Its 
one thing to be a small time crook with a ship, than to be part of a 
"family", "syndicate" or "cartel".

In my universe, most pirates are of the latter (large cartels) but have 
legitimate "fronts", especially when operating within or near the 3I.  Also, 
if news of a free-lance pirate reaches their ears.  That pirate would be 
"persuaded" to join the cartel.  The free-lancer rarely makes it big as a 
pirate unless he/she is very, VERY good!


I have been merely glancing over this thread so I don\'t know if this point 
has been brought up before.  If so, apologies.  But I am interested in what 
others do with respects to organized crime, not necessarily piracy.

I thought I would offer up my humble opinion on this book. The writing is
good. PRoduction, good. Intrinsicly, nothing wrong with it.

But it doesn\'t feel like traveller to me.

Why? Because it\'s so tongue-in-cheek. But wait, you say, it\'s a joke!
Didn\'t you read Dave\'s afterword?

Yes...but Traveller has never been a funny game. Don\'t get me wrong - humor
certainly has it\'s place in the game. I use it all the time. But the _GAME
ITSELF_ has not been "funny". Certainly the most feared race doesn\'t run
around in Santa Claus hats.

There are people on this list that love picking things apart. The TL of
ROM. The validity of piracy. The use of dropping rocks. Do you really think
that no scholar in the Imperium wouldn\'t notice that the Ithklur were
worshipping old saint nick? Heck, there could be solomani worlds where
Christmas is still observed.

It just didn\'t wash with me.

On a personal note, AOTR pisses me off more than any of the IG stuff
has...becuase I can convince myself that IG is just inept or stupid (sorry
for the insults, but some of the mistakes they\'ve made have been of this
caliber, IMHO). But AOTR was made the way it was made _purposely_. Which
surprises me...I\'ve always liked Dave\'s material in the past (Survival
MArgin, and Ranger for 2300AD come to mind).

Oh well, rant mode off :)

That would correspond to the original three mile limit. At least, I\'ve been
told that the origin of the three mile limit came from the fact that the
largest cannons could effectively reach out three miles from a shore battery.
Of course, this may be one of those plausible explanations that are made up
without any basis in fact.

Funny, if you had asked me I would unhesitatingly have said the jump limit
rather than the 10 diameter limit. Note, however, that the only official
information we have on the subject is that the spaceport itself is outside
the jurisdiction of the planet, so perhaps the limit is much closer to the
planet (Ie. anything above airspace plus a corridor down to the spaceport
carved out of the airspace.)

All in all I would suggest that the planet has full jusridiction below a
certain level, with the space immidiately over the spaceport excepted, and
joint jurisdiction throughout the system (ie. they can act against Imperially
accepted crimes if they want to, but can\'t act against crimes that are only
crimes locally).

Since the starport is outside Pysadian jurisdiction, IMO they couldn\'t even
force them to leave the planet. Though they could ask the spaceport
administrator to send them off. His jurisdiction may extend to 10 diameters
(though I would have said 100 diameters).

Uhhh....better make that 90% of DNA is _just waste space that we know of_! 
While it\'s certainly true that we seem to be carrying around a huge load
of DNA that doesn\'t do much more than use us to make more, evolution tends
to be a pretty conservative force. The energy wated in reproducig a load
of parasite genes is energy wasted...if there were\'nt _some_ function

(some huge number, anyway) So unless they bioengineered life on this
planet (helllooooo Grandpa!) that wouldn\'t work.

OK ... this means that ramming is for kamikaze attacks only, and it would be
pretty effective in that case (probably destroying whatever you hit). How
hard would it be to crash right into an enemy ship? I figure it would be
pretty hard due to the enormous velocities involved. Could the ship\'s
computers (if they were still functioning) help in this case, or would
security programs override any such attempts?

Well there are a couple things that mitigate against it. 

One, depending on how you do jump, you may not have control over your
vector when you exit.  So you pop out of jump doing 3 G _away_ from where
you want to go. Poof goes your time savings. 

Second, if it _can_ be done, it will be a favorite tactic for military
exit from jumpspace. In many systems a ship blasting in out of jump at max
acceleration will be assumed to be hostile and dealt with accordingly.
Poof goes your time savings, and possibly a large portion of your ship.

Why would it be any more difficult than, say, keeping a record of all cars
in the US? As for keeping it up to date, when a ship moves from one end of
the Imperium, it moves at jump-1, 2, or 3. Information about it would move
at jump-4 or better. The records of a world with very little traffic would
be less than up-to-date, granted, and it would be possible to outrun your
data if you go to such a world, but that just means that you merit extra
attention from the patrol there. And if the traffic is so low, they will
have time for you.

It\'s not that not appearing on the list will be any particular hardship
for any ship with its papers in order, it\'s that such a ship is suspicious
and can expect more than cursory attention.

You miss the third possibility, that it\'s not so much theft as
\'kidanpping\' for ransom. IIRC this happens in the art world far more often
that they like to talk about, because a museum really, _really_ doesn\'t
want it known that their security is poor. Wasn\'t this the original reason
for the theft of the Mona Lisa, anyway? (It was stolen, sometime early
this century, and was lost for quite some time, as I dimply recall)

This applies to starships, too. A shipowner, or shipping corporation might
well be willing to pay to get a ship back without adverse publicity that
could affect things like insurance premiums, cargo bookings, various
contracts (which may have specific clauses dealing with security, etc) or 
completion bonds.

The latter might well be the big ticket...some completion bonds can be
extremely punitive.

This relates to a question I had been meaning to ask for a long time...do
thruster-plate ships build a vector like reaction-thrust vessels or not?  If
the do, then the travel formula is canon (it is anyway), but if they don\'t
then the formula is incorrect.  

This has an enormous effect on starship combat, obviously.  MT used the
vector based system for it\'s starship combat system and that used a modified
HG-style system.  But I have heard on the list and in other places that the
intent was that reactionless thrusters build no vector...

Anyone have any comments? Thoughts?  Snide remarks?  :-)

It seems to me that you could get more for a stolen starship from a chop
shop [criminal enterprise that steals cars, cuts them into pieces and
sells the pieces seperately] then if you sold it as a whole.  You simply
cut out the valuable parts, such as jump drives and computers and sell
them as used.  They will have ID numbers on them and this will probably
include some that are too small and/or hidden to burn off so you will
have to sell them to a less than honest starship repair yard.  They can
then put these "reconditioned used parts in like new condition aquired
by salvage" into ships to replace dammaged parts or use them to build a
new starship.  I suspect that some pieces of starships _will_not_have_
ID numbers on them and can be sold as "reconditioned used parts in like
new condition aquired by salvage" even to honest sources.  This will
only include smaller and "less valuable" but still expensive pieces. 
This will increase the money you can make.

Given the extremely high cost of starships it will be easier to tempt
people into buying stolen parts.  Suppose that _your_ starship is
broken.  You cannot afford to buy the part to fix it.  If you do not get
the ship back in service you will not be able to keep up on the loan
payments and the bank will take your ship away.  The bank will not give
you a loan to buy the parts because your ship is already worth less than
the ammount remaining on your ship loan.  The repair shop wants cash up
front so you cannot get it fixed & then skip out on your bill. You do
however have enough money to buy a "reconditioned used parts in like new
condition aquired by salvage" part. What do you do ?

1)  Loose your ship ?
2) Borrow money to buy new parts from a loan shark ?
3) Buy stolen parts and try to pretend, even to yourself, that you do
not know they are stolen and that you are helping piracy ?
4) Commit some other crime or high risk job (ie adventure) to get the
money to fix your ship ?

Most player charecters will pick option number 3 or 4.  I think that a
lot of otherwise honest merchants will pick option 3.  When the money
involved in business starts getting into the millions temptation
increases.

Yup. I use this in my games. And I have a Charisma or Appearance attribute
as well, so bad physical damage can affect that. Also, the \'death\' rolls in
char gen (now "injury" rolls in T4) have always (in my game) resulted in
stat reduction - anything from STR to EDU or CHR. Explaining exactly what\'s

Ok, so of our astronomers out there, how many such asteroids or similar are
likely to exist (a) within 100 diameters or so of most planets and (b)
between worlds (assuming some intra-system traffic).

Would this be a sufficiently small number (remembering that even for an
EMM-masked ship the asteroid must be of sufficient size to disguise the
ship\'s signature) that they would generally be shot out of the sky "just for
safety" by the local patrol ships.

Alternatively, what\'s stopping a ship from trying to give out an
asteroid-like signature anyway. Presumably suitably
sensor-reflecting/absorbing paint to give the right sort of returns,
combined with an appropriate surface configuration?

Perhaps a pirate ship can hide within a \'blow up\' asteroid shell, which it
simply collapses (or bursts out of) once within range of its target?

I really admire your confidence in the computers and the clerks of the
future. I just don\'t see it the way you do :-) A registry containing a
couple of millions ships spread around the galaxy is going to be very
hard to keep track of. i grant you that there will be good lists of the
largest ships, but small freighters, free traders, yatchs and so on is
impossible in my view to keep tabs on. They will know who owns the ship,
who manufactured it, its ID-number and such info. What cargo it has
carried, where it has been, who the captain and the crew is will be much
harder to keep tabs on. And the clever and resourceful captain will have
no trouble bribing clerks on low tech worlds to put new owners on the
ship, put forth false cargo papers and so on. Also with the x-boat route
how does the ships info reach the system before the ship? Say you attempt
to hi-jack a trader (just let us assume that piracy exists.) You fail and
imideatly jump to the next system. While you are in jump, the naval
vessels of the world you jump from investigate the insident, making 100%
sure that you are the criminal and not the other way around (you might
just have jumped to avoid being the victim). They need statements, review
the radiotraffic just before the incident, study the flightpath, do
investigating work and so on. At least a couple of days work, maybe a week
or two before there can be put out a general piracy alert on your ship.
The Imperium don\'t need large lawsuits because they hauled in the wrong
ship. Then the info is sent out with the X-boat system.

A piracy incident or any other criminal event requires an investigation
before the varrents for arrests are issued, or maybe the Imperium isn\'t to
keen on personal rights. You seem to forget that there is a huge
admininistrational system that needs to be put in motion before the info
can be shipped to the nearby systems. This is not going to take seconds
and are at best not subject to human error.

On my new Saturn, base value $18,000, I pay roughly $1000 per year (1/18th
of the value of the car) for the following;

Repair in the event of a Collision ($500 deductable)
Liability for Damage to others (up to $50k I think)
Liability for Health Expenses for others or passengers (up to $300k I think)
Replacement in the event of Fire/Theft (According to book value)
My own Health expenses in the case of a collision with an uninsured auto.

There is more than that, but that\'s a fair basis, Now lets translate;

For 4.5Mcr/ Year (375,000Cr/Month);
- -Repair in the event of docking collision, landing accident or mid-space
   collision, or act of vandalism, with 2 Mcr Deductable.
- -Depreciated Value (total Value less 1/40th per year of age of total value)
   reimbursed in the event of damage equal to that value or theft.
- -Liability for damage to facilities, other ships, etc in the case of damage up
   to a predetermined total (300 Mcr?) and health expenses.

and, of course, free windshield replacement.

Insurance (using the same model) will *not* cover;
"Acts of Nature" such as asteroid collisions
Deliberate damage by the owner
Damage due to regular wear and tear or negligence
Damage from acts of War
Damage from incorrectly installed parts, defective parts, etc.

There may be a better prototype; Ship (wet) insurance such as that provided
by Lloyds, but that insurance (as I understand it) was bought by the owners
who stayed behind, not by owners aboard since, in the event the insurance
was collected, those aboard were probably dead.

Always remember that Insurance companies make a profit by betting that you
will not need the insurance to pay for repairs.  If a captain has a bad
record the premiums will go up.  If the area of operation (required
information...outside which the policy will be void) is particularly
dangerous, the premiums go up.  Anything which can be legitimately known
and which increases risk will cause premiums to increase.

Insurance is really just a tool for regulating expenses.  In the end you
will have paid more over time than the likely benefit received, its just
that you will have spread those expenses over a lot of time instead of
getting it in one lump.

Barratry

Barratry is the practice of a ship\'s master doing intentional harm to their
own ship or cargo.  Rest assured that any attempt to make a claim of theft
or damage  will be investigated thoroughly, at least until you pay off the
inspector.

Seriously though, there would be a "cooling off" period and a serious
investigation conducted before any payoff resulted.  I would expect there
to be a standard \'waiting period\' for any ship supposedly lost in jumpspace
and a hearty reward (1/5th the payoff?) for information leading to proving
fraudulent insurance claims.

I think you can find a few adventure hooks buried in the above.  PCs in
general might find insurance a bit of a burden for little repayment (until
they get in a collision, or have their ship stolen).  On the other hand I
would bet that most merchants do have insurance, and it may even be
mandatory before landing at some starports, perhaps those outside the
Imperium.

There\'s no \'purported\' about it, they *are* missing. I think it\'s safe to say 
most characters will encounter more vehicles than gigaton starships, so your 
comparison is rather odd.

The problems with EV have been well documented. I don\'t expect new ones will

While ground pressure is important when designing a vehicle (otherwise you end

afterwards.

As much as I can agree without having seen EV, I agree.  Actually,
Leroy\'s "pro" review was almost enough on it\'s own to make me decide not
to buy it - all the things he praised were negative points for me.  I\'ll
give EV a quick look, but I\'ll probably just stick with 101 Vehicles.

Your inexperience compared to certain others does not make your opinions
any less worthwhile - Traveller needs new blood if it is to prosper -
and anyway, there a plenty of folks here with access to less
"historical" Traveller than you.  So you can have it both ways! ;-)

Despite my STRONG distaste for the style in which it\'s presented, I find
H&I worth having anyway.  I\'ve only got 3 of the original Alien modules
(Aslan, Hivers, Solomani) and one of the MT (Vilani & Vargr).  Hivers is
my personal favourite of these, which goes some way towards explaining
my distaste - the original is not IMO treated with respect.

There is a tradition in Traveller of taking what we "know" about a
subject and turning it around.  I like this.  H&I takes the idea that
Hiver society is a harmonious, well-adjusted whole and pulls it apart.
Good!

BUT, the way this is done grates on me.  "Hiver Mechnod Photo Hello" is
a Mystery Science Theatre viewing of the original alien module (which is
where the pre-commentary text comes from).  It picks holes not only in
the "facts" presented, but also the author\'s style and presentation
techniques that have been used in many other Traveller books (and SF
works at large).  For instance, when making comparisons it\'s commmon to
use one real-world example and a made-up one, for flavour.  Everybody
knows they are made up, but I don\'t want some other invented character
gleefully pointing it out!  To me it\'s a bit like publishing a tech book
with commentary from an Old Timer saying things like "of course, jump
drive is impossible - but we pretend to go along with it because
otherwise the Imperium would fall apart".

The Ithklur material is all new.  By the time I got to this, I wasn\'t in
the best mood to appreciate the humour.  The Santa Claus stuff is just
one symptom of a more general problem for me - the constant references
to late 20th century US culture, including lots of references I didn\'t
get as a Brit.  Now, I know the only way we can relate to these things
is by relating them to what we know - but it would be nice to *pretend*
that there are some other influences, that society in Traveller is based
on more than 1% of human history.

I guess my overall problem is that any suspension of disbelief is
shattered on a regular basis.  And I\'m afraid the afterword explaining
the style of presentation didn\'t help.  It seemed to be saying "let\'s
stop pretending" in a game which is an organised version of "let\'s
pretend"...

You\'re not actually missing much information at all.  The Hiver world-
building & travel rules, Hiver Federation map, homeworld/capital data,
and Hiver space adventure were deliberately omitted to keep the emphasis
on the RC; CT character generation was of course inappropriate in TNE.
Most of the physiological/psychological/social details were kept.  The
anatomical drawings in the original were IMO much better, and there may
be some other, minor stuff, but nothing too drastic.

As usual, sorry for the rant.  To make up for it, here\'s a few things I
did like about H&I:

* The undermining of the "happy Hiver society" image (see above).
* The way the Rebellion manipulation was handled.
* The Ithklur character (once stripped of contemporary references).
* The "alternative view" of the K\'Kree manipulation (although I don\'t
  entirely buy it, it\'s nice to see).

Oh, and I recreated the ballet scene in a GURPS IOU game, by passing
notes to a caveman\'s player describing the ballet in Ithklur-like terms
(he\'d never seen H&I or the original TNS entry) - with gratifyingly
similar results... 8-)

That\'s easy. Energy released is MVsquared. Mass is the mass of antimatter in
grams, velocity is light speed in m/s. This gives you the base energy.
Divide by 5 million to get the rough equivalent in TNT. CSC gives the
formula for converting danage from real world numbers. You would probably
use VERY small a amounts of AM to avoid taking yourself out when you fire.

I believe that "canon"ically, the Imperium has jurisdiction of *all*
space. There is *no* local governement space zone. The Imperium has
jurisdiction over the starport, right? Imperial laws govern there. Why
would the local government have authority in space (International water
zone) if this were the case?

Just like if the United Nations had laws and authority over all water
ports on earth, why would local governements still have authority in the
water? I know, I know, fishing, offshore oil reserves, etc. Analogy
falls apart. But there\'s nothing to mine or fish in space, is there?

When a planetary government agrees to join the Imperium, they agree to
allow the Imperium to govern *all* space. Once you\'re outside regular
"airspace" and in "outer space" you are under the jurisdiction of the
Imperium.

The Imperium grants local worlds the right to launch sattelites and
other commercial and scientific probes, but reserves the right to
enforce its laws regarding interstellar trade, piracy, capital crimes
etc. in the zone outside regular airspace, which could be defined by an
arbitrary distance of, say, 200 km or so.

Under the specific circumstances of your game, I believe that once the
players are in the starport, they are no longer under the laws of
Pysadi. Technically, they\'ve already *left* Pysadi. The best the
Pysadian government could do is not allow them to exit the starport on
foot, in a vehicle, or by public transport.

I imagine that the actual airspace above the starport is also governed
by Imperial Law, so if the characters choose to leave the starport by
spaceship, they wouldn\'t be allowed to enter Pysadian airspace and the
only direction they can go is up. Once free of atmosphere, they are free
to orbit the planet, kick around the system, do whatever.

OTOH, the Imperium could have mechinisms which allow it to extradite
troublesome Travellers. Perhaps the Pysdian government could petition
the Imperium for an Imperial Warrant forcing them to leave the system.

I\'m flabbergasted too. Glad to see you\'ve been enlightened. ;->

We used to play around with this formula ever since it was published in
the Traveller Book.

Marc posted comments on the difference between a "Running Jump" and a
"Standing Jump" a bit back which relied on the difference between
midpoint deceleration and full acceleration. The problem with this
approach is that conversation of momentum isn\'t taken into account.
("standing" relative to what?)

It has been mentioned before that stars are moving relative to one
another, and worlds are moving relative to the primary, by virtue of
their orbit. Even if your vector relative to the local world is zero,
(which means you\'re whizzing about the primary at the planet\'s orbital
vector) your vector relative to the intended destination is rarely so.
You jump to a star moving X km/s away from the local system (and the
destination world orbiting about the star at a particular velocity and
direction) and you pull out your hair at the massive calculation.

Just assuming that jumpspace magically erases out your momentum in
normalspace, and then magically creates a new, similar position and
vector relative to the destination world was something I used to accept,
but now I feel It\'s inelegant and unrealistic. It\'s better to do
something just as arbitrary, but more random.

Generally, ships travelling from one world to a specific destination
system will use a similar "corridor" (ie. heading and velocity relative
to the planet) in order to create the most favourable exit vector when
they arrive at the destination.

I would recommend that you devise an Astrogation Task to determine an
optimal exit and entry vector, dependent upon your destination. Use the
results of that task to apply to a roll on a time multiplication factor
table of some sort. The time is quite random since jump travel time
varies, good astrogation can ameliorate the results.

Here\'s an example I\'m making out of thin air off the top of my head on
the spot ;-), Note that I created this table without reference to the
Starship Operators\' Manual which has a similar table, iirc. I may be out
to luch with the factors. I hope others with opinions on this matter
have some comment/ modifications/ reality checks... 


To Determine Travel Times
=========================

To determine optimal travel vector to Jump Point:
Difficult. Astrogation+INT
Task becomes Formidible if "spoofing" destination system.

"Spoofing" means that the players do not attempt an optimal vector for
the destination system, in order to make an observer believe they could
be jumping somewhere else. Without spoofing, an observer can readily
determine the jumping ship\'s destination. Rarely would two optimal
vectors for two different jump destinations coincide.

Roll 2d6 and apply DMs below. Multiply the rolled modifier by the travel
time determined by the standard (accel / decel.) travel time tables to
determine actual travel time.

0-	0.3x
1	0.4
2	0.5
3	0.58
4	0.65
5	0.75
6	0.9
7	1x   (Standard midpoint decell. time)
8	1.1
9	1.3
10	1.5
11	1.7
12	2
13	2.5
14	3
15	3.5
16	4
17	4.5
18+	5x

DMs
- -2	if Spectacular Success in Astrogation Task.
+2	if Failure in Astrogation Task.
+4	if Spectacular failure in Astrogation Task.
+5	if "Spoofing" destination.


To determine optimal travel vector from Jump exit point to destination:
Average. Astrogation+INT

Before exiting jump, roll 2d6 and note the result. I will use R as the
result. Time in jump is calculated by 168 + (R-7)x3 hours. (roughly one
week +/- 10%)

To determine travel time to destination, look up R on the table,
applying _the same DMs_ as rolled the first time *and* DMs for this task
roll.

Explanation:
- ----
If R was 7, then jump time was exactly the standard one week that you
based the first Astrogation task upon, so R determines variability of
travel time from jump exit point to destination.

If the first roll was screwed up, or spoofed, then the exit vector
should not be optimally in line with the destination world, therefore
you apply the DMs from the first task roll. By the same token,
spectacular success in the first roll means that the exit to destination
time is usually lower, as a particularly good course was plotted.

It could be though, that the variability in Jump time means you got
lucky, and happened to get a good line with the destination world, even
though you "spoofed" your "approach" vector.

CAVEAT: I\'m not sure that using standard acell/decel tables is
reasonable with this system. Perhaps straight aceleration? (0.5at^2) so
t=sqrt(2d/a)

One word;  Pyramids

You know, we still don\'t know what all those pictograms mean.

Oh, fine, the pyramids of Earth are not relics of an alien civilization,
but they *have* lasted, pretty much unchanged, for (insome cases) nearly
3000 years.  That\'s about as long as anything manmade has lasted to date.

Cheap?  Well, use local materials and possibly labor...

Anyway, its a thought.

How long would these journeys have taken?  Any idea how many passengers

Glenn has expressed my views precisely.  This list has always been
productive, but less so recently (I delete whole swaths of "Piracy"
discussions lately).

Can we get back to our regulary scheduled Traveller discussions now (not to
downplay the useful discussions on various subjects still happening).

But of course! Thruster-plates only violate a few piddling laws of
conservation of energy, they don\'t repeal the conservation of momentum
and Newton\'s laws of motion, Einstein\'s relativity, etc.

AFAIK, Traveller is still true to using vector mechanics in starship
combat. Object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by a force
such as T-plates...

Not to mention in the right TL...

As far as I remember, antimatter power and weapons began at TL16 (MT
Referees Manual).  Antimatter missiles are the same.  I believe the problem
is containement.  Also remember that creating antimatter requires energy
equal to the annihilation energy.  This is considerable, even with Fusion.
Besides, if you\'re making that much energy already, why not pump it into
your more conventional laser or particle accellerator?

Wasn\'t there an adventure around raiding a rebellion era Depot for parts to
repair an experimental TL16 Disintegrator? (perhaps the Rebellion
Sourcebook)  I seem to recall that the disintegrator was simply a particle
accellerator which used antimatter particles (perhaps that was my owm
explanation).

The way I read this, and I could be wrong, was that the speed increase is used to just get

Yes, I thought of that too, except that\'s a lot of space to cover for a
planet, especially if it is of low tech, and I figure that one of the
benefits of being a member of the Imperium must be that the Imperium
will protect (not patrol in all cases) this space for you.

Yes, I thought of that as well--thinking that the Imperium controls
everything beyond a certain orbit (maybe the farthest moon, or a certain
height if the planet has no moons)--but what if the planet wants more
control than that.

If there\'s no Naval Base in the system, the planetary govt may want to
run some SDB\'s.

Also, there might be "concurrent jurisdiction" in some systems, where
the official jurisdiction line is the 10 diam limit, but the Imperium or
the Planet\'s forces can follow ships past the other\'s line.  For
example, pirate activity occurs at jump point 100 diams out, then some
Imperial SDB\'s chase them.  The pirates run to the planet\'s 10 diam line
because the planet is Govt 0 and piracy is not illegal.

I don\'t see the Imperial SDB\'s just stopping at the 10 diam line,
letting the pirates make faces at them because they are now in neutral
space.

I guess I picture this more like when Federal jurisdiction overrides
State Lines.

I don\'t know, I\'m still gestating all of this.

That sounds reasonable.  I\'m starting to lean towards not having a
blanket rule for this.  Star systems are too different.  What will work
at TL 4 Pysadi (with no Naval Base, only one inhabited planet, and, in
my campaign, only two shuttles at the star port, and the starport
facility is only on the ground) probably won\'t work at TL 12 Aramis
(which has several inhabited planets, more than one Naval Base, more
than one Scout Base, with both a Highport and a Downport).

I believe I\'m going to rule that in each system this will be considered
individually.  This is probably a point of contention between the
Imperium and the planet when the planet becomes a member of the
Imperium.  I picture this like an unannexed community on the outskirts
of a large city--there\'s also disputes over who provides
police/fire/trash services, and this is worked out as the city grows and
annexes the community.

Star systems with Naval Bases will probably have planetary jurisdiciton
to a point, but concurrent Imperial jurisdiction in the entire
system--including the same space the planet patrols.

For other systems, I\'ll have to figure this out, if it comes up, when I
detail the system, basing my decisions on the political climate and
planetary resources of the main world.

This is how I kinda played it.  All along during the four months the
characters were planet side, I played the starport as being
extraterritorial, but having a tight relationship with the planetary
government.

The Pysadians did ask the starport manager to send them off, which he
did (not wanting too, but picking the lesser of the two evils--he\'s got
to live there after all), and I extended jurisdiciton to the 10 diam
point.

I may increase this to the whole system.  They don\'t have a Naval Base,
and there is no way for the planet to defend itself from Travellers
unless they get lucky and find a ship in port for hire.  (Ya know, this
can work as an adventure both ways--being the ship for hire, or being
chased by the ship for hire--I like that!)

In the Pysadian\'s case, they\'ve got jurisdiction throughout the solar
system, but  they can\'t do that much about it--unless they hire a ship,
if there is a ship to hire, or they use the two unarmed shuttles the
starport has.

Boy, it\'s a bitch being low tech and poor, isn\'t it?

  Probably any of the above, with premiums varying by risk. It\'s really
up to you to eyeball it with a minimal rate guideline, until some kind-
hearted industry person writes it up for the TML. (hmm, either insurance
or trucking industries, come to think of it).

  IIRC, one of the old JTAS had a brief mention of insurance rates.

  In extremis, for a safe area, all coverage, (except preventable break-
downs) say, 0.3% of coverage/month, with a rate break for longer coverage
in the same area of operations (and administration).

  Mega-corps are, of course, self-insuring.

Hans, 

You have used this position several times in defending your belief that
the IN can put as many warships in the sky as necessary.

I have asked this before, and I\'ll ask it again.  How can the Imperium
afford to have 500 cops per household?  You say that the numbers support
it.  I say the numbers are wrong.  If not the economics, then the
population base would not be able to support this type of military
structure.

	Sure, and when the pirates get too obnoxious, the good guys send a fleet

I use the cannon definition of jump where you can jump anywhere,
anytime, standing still or moving at a high rate of speed.

You can even enter jump from the hangar on the planet, if you can
survive the gravitational effects.

If you are out past 100 diams, I don\'t see a problem with entering jump
at any speed--standing still or trucking.  You\'ll exit your jump point
on the other side, moving in a relative direction at the same rate of
acceleration.

Now, I have thought of a new problem, but it\'s only a problem if you are
using the CT computer and program rules like we are.

The Harrier has a model/1 computer, so it can only have two size 1
programs in its RAM at one time.  To enter jump space, you\'ve first got
to run generate and navigation, and then as you jump, you replace the
generate program with the jump program.  In jump, you can load something
else in place of the navigation program, but you need both navigation
and jump running as you come out of jump space.

Basically, with a model/1, you just don\'t have the computing power to
run maneuver, so standard practice must be to bring the ship to a halt
before jumping.  It would be dangerous to exit jump at a high rate of
speed and not have maneuver running to control the ship for 30 minutes
(the time it takes to load maneuver).

So, yes, it can be done, but standard practice must be to decelerate,
then jump, exiting jump motionless, and accelerating to your
destination.

This might be, but a bigger limitation on the use of this tactic is the
computing power of the ship.  Some of these big warships have the
computing power to run everything they need to do this, but most small
ships are usually running at Jump-1 or Jump-2, and they are just not
going to have the computing power to run maneuver with all of the other
programs needed for entering and exiting jump space.

Thanks for you input.  You\'ve helped me think this through, and now I
have a ruling to let the guys know next session.  Actually, I think I\'ll
go ahead and send them an e-mail now.

an alternative approach, and I\'d like to hear some comments on it:

Given that:

- - You can\'t really hide in space, especially if you start some kind of
  battle.
- - You must catch your target before it jumps, and to do this you have 
  to catch it quite near the planet.
- - Transponders and databases could (arguably) be used in order to
  recognize ships.
- - Navy has the resources to easily intercept suspect ships.

I propose to consider Navy protection in the same way software
companies enforce copyrights through tech support: you are entitled
to it only if you are a legitimate customer.

Case 1:
You are Joe Lawful. Your earn your living with boring 7-jumps tours
inside a small zone of your home sector, specializing in hi-tech
parts deliver.  You have registered your ship at each of the 7
spaceports you usually visit, paying a reasonable fee and enjoying
full support from the spaceport authorities. You have a flight path
and updated system info masered to you whenever you jump in,
preferential placement schedule for your landings and so on. 
You are considered trustworthy by port authorities which are usually
content with a cursory customs check while you are refuelling at the
starport.


Case 2: 
You are Janet Never-dowell. You operate another small trader, but
don\'t have any qualms at transporting questionable stuff or sinister
looking passengers for a good fee.
You freely roam wherever you want, but you are not registered
anywhere, and you usually try avoiding "unnecessary" entanglements
with customs.

When Jolly Roger, merchant *and* space pirate, decide to attack Joe
Lawful\'s free trader, he knows that all the SBDs in the area will
close in for the kill. He will have very little time to act, and will
probably have to forge new papers (and/or transponder codes) before
getting back to the system.

On the other hand, if he attacks the _Unprincipled_, Janet\'s ship, SDBs
will move in only on Janet\'s request... but she will then have to pass a
*very* thorough inspection after the incident. She will have to
decide if she prefers fighting off Roger\'s attack on her own or face
the Navy/Customs check of her ship [Navy will be interested in people
carrying military grade weapons and/or equipment without mercenary
contracts, or illegal drugs, wanted criminals and any peculiar
cargo].
Considering how long this may take, people reasons for *not* calling
the SDBs would not even need to be sinister: if your departure is
extremely urgent, and Customs inspection will require you docking at
highport and spend 6+ hours with officials, you may prefer making a
run for it and fight your way out instead of losing more than a day
of businness.

Megacorporations will obviously be fully registered [and given their
status, they could even bypass the custom inspection after the
attack]. Independent Traders will be free to decide for themselves
what they prefer (I\'d say that if they want to carry mail they should
be registered and in good stand with planetside authorities). Most
other cases will be considered as "legitimate businness conflicts"
(IIRC there is some mention of them in canon), and Navy will not
interfere without an explicit request.

Navy officers are still free to overrule this, obviously, especially
when pirate ships start becoming too active, lot of lives are lost or
when interships conflict becomes dangerous for other ships.

In my last post on this, I came to the conclusion that each system would
have to be dealt with individually.  It\'s the GM\'s realm to make
decisions like these when he is detailing the planet or star system
before the game.

The GM will have to get a feel for the politics and the technological
capability of the world, then use his creative genius to come up with an
interesting, involving, totally player-captivating description of how
this is done in this particular system.

I can\'t see a blanket rule for balkanized planets.  If it\'s a planet
like Aramanx or Porozlo in the Spinward Marches, I\'d say that the
Imperium has juridiction to close orbit.  Those planets are verging on
war, and unless there\'s a dominate power, no country will probably have
enough resources to patrol the heavens too.

Then, if you look at Terra or some other balkanized planet at peace, you
might have a multi-national force (like  the UN) with jurisdiction for
the system.

On a similar note, I don\'t always have starports with extrality. 
Sometimes I detail a world so that the starport is a major income
producer for the planet--owned and operated by the local government,
where all planetary laws apply.

Players can get information on things like jurisdiction and whether the
starport is extraterritorial from the ship\'s library program--if they
have a program for that subsector (I make my players buy one library
program per subsector for specific information like this and one library
program per sector for general information).

I agree that the shipyards will have more traffic, and the jump capable

suffer if the starport cannot support the traffic (and by definition, a Class 
E cannot).  So I will add the x.5 if the world is Class D or worse (Class C is 
the standard, non-shipyard starport).

I am still working on this part of it.  The idea was to have the large ships 
forming the backbone of commerce.  They could only be profitable, however, if 
you can guarantee 80% or better cargo capacity, which is why I was limiting 
them to the larger worlds.  (The Traveller Adventure, as I recall, had 25,000 
dTon cargo ships delivering naval weapons)

[blush]  No, I meant per year, but forgot to divide by 12.  I\'m still trying 
to find the right balance between a LOT of traffic at the hi-pop/hi-tech 
worlds, and little traffic at the lo-pop/lo-tech worlds.  Lets alter the 
number a bit...

(World TL*(Pop Code^2)) Ktons per year

This would give Mora [Starport A, Pop A, TL F] (Starport A (2)*(TL(15) * (Pop 
(10)^2))) = 3000 Ktons of cargo traffic per year.  Mora is a Capital (x2) and 
is industrial (x4) giving a grand total of 24 Mtons per year, or 2 MTons per 
month.  Again, this is not cargo ships, but cargo capacity.

Fen\'l Gren [Starport C, Pop 3, TL 9] (TL(9)*(Pop(3)^2) = 81 Ktons of cargo 
traffic per year or 6,750 Ktons per month.  It is non-industrial, so it gets 
no addtional modifiers.

Modified Table:

x1.5 if Starport B
x2 if Starport A

x2 if the world is AG or is Ri
x3 if the world has a military base or is a Capital
x4 if the world is Ind

Except that ships will collide more often where they are
closer together, near port, where they are also going slower.
Also, ships that collide will often be ships that are going
to similar desitination (and will have the similar courses
and similar speeds).  (The best place to depart of to a
planet will not be the best place to arrive).  In any case,
even if you assume the starship collisions are generally
fatal, that only matches the effects of aircraft collision.

I don\'t see what tavel time has to do with it.  If it take
100 ATVs and drive them for an hour down a narrow canyon,
they are more likely to run into each other than if I
drive them around open desert for an hour.

Well, exaust expands (and hences cools) quickly in a vacuum.
I\'m not that sure it will be so hot, in any case, I just
don\'t see the danger zone being that much bigger, esp since
detection ranges are a _lot_ bigger.

A few minutes is easy to make up.  You could do it in the

This example seems to be a bit spurious as the Coast Guard protects the USA and 
not the America\'s (incl the Caribean).  I would hope that piracy is not 
prevailent in the coastal waters of the US of A (much as it would not be 
present in the orbit and jump lanes of any Imperial World).  I believe the 
Imperium doesn\'t much care about those outside its borders (except for ways to 
reverse that status) and thus the Imperiums equivilent of the caribean may be 
packed full of piracy (I doubt it but....) but thye Imperium is in itself 
pirate free.

As always this excludes the crazies (and the needs of the Ref).

point where Imperial juristiction ends.

I\'ve always assumed that each world controlled \'close orbit and local
space\' - ie as much area as its government could get away with claiming.
This will vary from system to system, which seems appropriate given the
\'open\' attatude to local affairs of the Imperium. The norm will probably be
about halfway to the nearest safe Jump point, ie 50 diameters, IF the world
can patrol and police that distance. For non-spacegoing worlds the limit
will be atmospheric limit.

The \'Halfway to the Jump Point\' limit would be preferred by the Imperial
authorities to give a chance to intercept, stop and search traffic before
ships could duck into local space and avoid an Imperial customs search.
(It\'s entirely possible to be searched by Imperial and local forces
seperately, but normally this is left to the locals to deal with.) 

However, there will be almost as many variants on this as there are worlds.
Those worlds which own other planets in the system will own local space
around them, and may insist upon a jurisdictional corridor between the
worlds (since both are moving, this is a treaty-writer\'s nightmare), or may
claim the region containing both. The bargaining over this jurisdiction
will form part of every world\'s Inclusion Charter.

So: I\'d say the \'International Waters\' bein 50 diameters out, subject to
local variation which incidentally gives the players a chance to get
something wrong and land themselves in trouble.

Perhaps and alternative is to cound 10 diameters as sovereign territory,
100+ as Imperial Space, and the remaining area as \'shared jurisdiction\'.
This could be one of the \'regional variances\' I mentioned.

Really nice work!

A few comments that come to mind:

In this scheme, the containers and pins take most of the load in case of
loss of grav control.  Therefore you\'d probably have containers rated
for different g\'s or have a max accelleration you could pull w/ AG in
operative.  There also would be maximums on how many containrs apart the
ship\'s structural members could be.  

Some of this is more applicable to large ships than smaller ones. 
Running a small ship with small cargos on an independant route, you
might want access to all containers.  You may even carry small
standardized containers packaged by the customer inside your own
containers.

I can\'t imagine a design which doesn\'t allow some manual method of
releasing the cargo.  At least not on a ship the size of which most PC\'s
will be operating.  It may need the release of some electronically coded
lock (which could be done with a handcomp if the ship\'s systems are
down), but should be possible w\'out full ships capabilities.  Of course,
the above disassembly could be required in the case that the access code
is not available (in the hypothetical piratical case ;).

I see your point here, and my thinking lies along the same lines as
yours (as it has in most cases in the past), but I\'m a little more
liberal with planetary governmental power.

Like I said in a previous post, as a general rule most starports in my
campaign are extraterritorial, but not all.  There are planets who
derive major portions of their total income from the operation of the
starport.  Those starports, in my game, don\'t have extrality.

Likewise, some planets can protect themselves better than the Imperium
can.  I\'d think those would want at least some stretch of space to
operate their planetary SDBs in.  Maybe they\'ve got a mining facility on
the gas giant moon somewhere out system.  They\'ve got to have some
authority in which to protect that.

The Imperium can\'t be every where all the time, especially if there\'s no
Naval base insystem.

And, what about an asteroid belt?  It is mostly space.  If there is no
Naval Base, surely there could be a local policing force (maybe a mining
company security force) there to help discourage piracy, corsairs, and
disputes between independent miners.

There\'s so many factors to consider, when you start to think about it. 
And, this is why I\'ve been leaning in the direction of making the
"interstellar waters" issue dependent on the politics and technology of
each individual system--not making a general rule, but deferring to GM
creative input as he details the world.

OK, let\'s say they have committed murder on Pysadi.  Are you saying that
they can retreat to the starport, get on their ship, and lift off before
the starport people know anything about it.

Then, they can hover in space, taunting the Pysadian government over the
radio, and the Pysadians can\'t do a thing about it?

There\'s no Naval Base in the Pysadian system.  Subsequently, at least in
my campaign, there\'s no Imperial presence.

I could see the Imperial government extraditing the Harrier\'s crew back
to Pysadi to stand trial, but there\'s no force there to get them.  The
best Pysadi could do is forward communication about these events the
nearest Naval Base and hope they get caught and sent back at a later
date.

OK, let\'s make this more complicated.  The characters really didn\'t
commit murder in my campaign.  They kicked at an anola, the Pysadian
sacred animal.  The actual kicker got a year in a Pysadian jail, and the
rest of the crew were asked (ordered) to leave the planet.

Kicking at a monkey is not an Imperial offense.  So, the characters
leave the planet, but hover in space in the ship.

The Pysadian\'s have no jurisdicition here in their own solar system? 
People can just break their laws (it\'s a capital offense to kill an
anola) and retreat to orbit, and everything\'s OK?

I don\'t know, but I feel that the jurisdiction question is more
complicated than that.

Well, in MT and CT detection ranges are about a light second or

Example: Sonar.  Introduced in the early part of the century and touted
as the end of the submarine threat.  Countered - noise reduction,
propeller design, special coatings on the hulls of subs.

Example: Radar.  Introduced in the mid-part of the century.  Countered -
stealth technology consisting of new composites, angles on the aircraft,
etc...

Example: Armored vehicles.  Introduced at the end of WWI.  Peaked during
WWII.  Countered - man portable AT weapons, aircraft delivered AT
weapons.  Interestingly enough, armor is making a comeback with the use
of active defenses (reactive armor and the like) against the MPAT
weapons...

While we all like to have the devices that are used nailed down, I\'m not
sure we can do so with certainty.  However, I think I am safe saying
(and I will continue to do so) that a ship with TL C EMS can be spoofed
by a ship with TL D stealth.  (Example - do you think a WWII destroyer,
with state of the art TL 5 sonar, is going to find a modern attack
submarine?)

It is my belief that, with the proper equipment, a ship can change it\'s
\'signature\', make itself appear larger or smaller, change it\'s
transponder signal (albeit with multiple transponders), and even reduce
the effective range that it can be detected at.

That does not mean I believe that the equipment is cheap, easy to get,
or even legal to possess.

The characters were trying to cut through an interior bulkhead with the

I judged the bulkhead to be about 4 cm thick and made of hard steel.

What is your opinion on how thick these interior bulkheads are made of,
and what do you think the standard material these things are made of
will be for a TL 12 vessel?



On a related note, they were thinking of cutting through the hull.  I
know this is superdense, but how thick do you think a starship hull is? 
If I have that, I can figure cutting time (or even if it is possible) by
using the materials chart in the CSC.

OK, first of all, I would like to point out that for those of
us who don\'t think pirates would hide like this, this isn\'t
a piracy issue.

Regarding the question at hand, it can be shown, with current
technology, how one might manipulate the directionality and
wavelength of emmissions.  It is not hard to think that
at TL 15 ships might be able to emit on a norrow beam
(which, given the size of space, means that the odds of
a ship being along that line are very small, or zero
if you can just point it at a small moon).  It is also
helpful if you drop the emmisions down into the microwave
background emmission of the univers.

Also, remember that space is not a blank background.
There are a lot of stars and a sun at 4 light years
will shine as bright as something putting out 1 MWatt
at 2000 km away.  Every star as bright as the sun in
50 light years will shine brighter than 1E9 Watt source
a light second away.
[If my calcs are right.  The suns output is 4E33 erg/sec
or 4e26 Watts]

I actually used this idea maybe ten adventures back in my current campaign,
although I got the idea myself and thought it was pretty original. Well,
that just goes to show...

The setup was a little different. A psionic noble (yes, I\'m playing off the
Psionic Knights campaign) was persued during the psionic suppressions, and
encoded the whereabouts of his (psionic) noble\'s order\'s tresuary in
plasmid rings in his blood, leaving behind him a subtle clue for friendly
successors to pick up.

The player characters found his buried body, dug it up and analyzed what
was left of his deteriorated blood. The party\'s (NPC) doctor found the
following obviously artificial encoding as part of more \'natural\' DNA:

>put one cop every fifteen feet throughout New York City

Well, my point was about putting a cop at every _intersection_.
It also wasn\'t that NYC could afford it, but wether the simple
kind of calculations that are being used for piracy would
also support the idea that NYC could afford it?

However, lets go to a clearer example.  Crime on subways
could easily be said to be more of a problem than piracy
would be.  If you take 1% of the military and plice budgets
you can claim to put 8,500 undercover cops riding trains
in NYC.  The same sort of reasoning used in piracy would
lead one to believe that this would make the odds of getting
caught so high that no one would try such a crime and that
clearly NYC would be expected to spend such a small portion
of their budget that they would never miss it to stop
this crime.

Unless the pirate just tells him he will kill them all if they
do anything like that.  Then you are relying on the idea that
a captain will risk death and loss of his whole ship just
to save one cargo and will do it realiably enough that it
will make piracy impossble.  I may work for you, but it\'s
quite a stretch to me.  In any case, this is reaching past
wether it is possible to transfer the cargoes in time into
what tatics pirates and captains might use.  I don\'t have
time for a game of tatics and counter tatics (which can
be endless) so I won\'t persue these posts past this.

Well, I\'m not sure the Ship Combat systems are geared to blowing
apart an unarmed ships at short range and are unrealistically
long time scales for that purpose.  In any case, the fact
that patrol boad will chase the pirate away after you are
dead isn\'t alot of consolation.

>You misunderstand me - the system failure is induced by fire from (a)
>pissed off merchant or (b) the approaching SDB.

Yeah, except you only attack merchants that are unarmed or so
poorly armed that they are not likely to damage you significantly.
As to the patrol, I don\'t have weapon fire ranges in front of me,
but even if they can fire all the way out to 100 diam (which
I would think would be screwed up, even at high tech levels)
you can just use the ship you pirating as a shield and force
the patrol to either kill him too, or wait until he is close.

>Re-reading the original post you sent I believe that your original
>hypothesis (crippling the ship in 5 min) is flawed.

Well, we disagree on that....

The insurance cost will depend on what the insurance companies
think is the odds of losses occuring from all causes covered
in the policy, the magnitude of the loss, and the profit
margin.

For each type of the loss the cost will be...

Cost/year = (Prob of loss/year) * Likely Size of Loss * (1 + Profit Margin)

So if the company want a 20% return and thinks there is a 1% chance of
loosing an 81 MCr ship to theft.  Then the yearly insurance will cost
0.01 x 81MCr x 1.2 = 0.97 MCr

Well, if the company think that lack of crew, etc. raises the
probability of loss, then they will raise the rate appropriately.
If they think that they can\'t know what the odds are (or if the
odds of loss are too high, maybe past 50%) then they may well
refuse coverage.

Hi!

Maybe I missed something...  Has the piracy thread been uncivil?  I\'ve
been following it pretty closely, (I for one, AM interested in it) and
except for a few remarks it has been pretty clean.

And, it occurs to me, it has spawned a range of side issues dealing with
some pretty fundamental subjects (industrial capacity, Imperial
economics, ship numbers in space and orbit, naval deployment strategies,
etc).

I\'m sorry we are not discussing something you find more interesting. 
Hopefully you will give us the same chance on this, that I (at least)
give to others when the list discusses subjects that I don\'t care to
follow.

Thanks!

	as usual the answer : It depends !

	- backwater systems who received an orbiter from Sylean
	  subsidary program at 100 diameter, will have 10 diameter
	  around they main world for local government
	- Rich system who have an own orbiter before the Sylean
	  mafia controled trade, will have SDBs in the system
	  including gas giants.
	- gas giants with naval bases will fall under juristication
	  of the 3I, same with scout stations around gas giants.
	  The home world will have the usual 10 diameters or control
	  of the remaining system if they can affort defense.
	- balkanised worlds will have several orbital flight path,
	  some of them are more or less secure, because rivaling
	  fractions have their own advanced planetary defense ;-(

> I\'m just flabbergasted that I never realized the travel time savings
> that could be had this way.

	Marc calls this a running jump. If vectors match this can save
	several hours, traders prefer to spend those in starport pubs.
	But a running jump is more difficult to calculated, one dice
	modifier for each g-turn spent is my house rule.

	So we could handwave the following situation: Jo Merchant
	encounters a pirate/vampire/ted, but as he was\'nt stupid
	last time when he had money and refittet power plant and
	thrusters from his TL:A trader to TL:C, he has enough
	accelleration to outrun the oponent. Its allways better
	to become an imposible target for a trader than to fight,
	even the smallest damage could cause ruin.

	Now after 4 hours, the pirate is still behind him but far away,
	he wants to jump, 4 hours at 3 G are a DM of 24, this is far
	imposible, even with a crack astrogator. 

	He has to turn, because he cant jump with the velocity he
	now has. Gives a nice head on situation, any ship has only
	one shoot perhaps two, if the priate notice turning imideate.

	After the hot hour he can accellerate until he is at zero
	velocity and jump without problem. This is not canon, but
	if could make an interesting evening.

	Even if you asume the save but overcrowded regency, those are to

	per system. Ok half of them, because a good trader is in jump
	space half of the time. But the number is still much to high.

	better count only ships, not boats.

	16 SDBs per system, if even distributed. If I asume the paranoid

	you can be right.

	I would think that any starport has at least one or two

	Those without a starport wont bother checking the papers.

	Your calculation has 2 minor flaws (IMHO ;-)

	Pop 6- worlds are non industrial, so no ships.

	Any starport is only producing those ship types he is
	good in, and only if its lucky to receive order. So TL:B-C
	starport will build those cheap J1/2 traders, while the
	Tl:D-E starports will have the good liners and sometimes
	bigger ships. The Tl:E-G starports will build luxus yachts
	and military vessels only. The price for a TL:F-Jump2
	drive is much higher than a TL:C-Jump2 drive. And price is
	whats counts for the purchaser.

	Most starports are happy when they receive outworld contracts,
	because they are running subsidary (means no work) from government
	to have a starport if there is war in next generation.

	So the real production is much lower than the theoretical
	maximal capacity from TCS or other sources. Only extremes
	(like virus around the Regency, or England in Renissance)
	show the full potencial of ship building capacity a nation
	has.

	My collapser is using the following asumption :

	Tl:7+ can become hacked, or controlled by a TL:A+
	      mainframe hosting an allready running AI
	Tl:8  can become hacked to store lower strain eggs
	Tl:9  can become hacked to store higher strain eggs
	Tl:A+ dynamic: can execute lower strains (up to puppetier)
	TL:D+ holographic: can execute higher strains
	TL:H+ is organic and therefore imune to the silicoid
	      hardware form. As TL:H is allready AI it has methods
	      to avoid becoming insane and has most times human
	      controls (shutdown button) for this event.

	From the existing capital a part will be destroyed (the
	lower the strain the higher the destruction) or controlled
	(the higher the strain the more systems are still running,
	but under control of the AI). Human population can try to
	fight, ignore or assimilate into the new economie. Naval
	bases normaly have backup equipment so chances are sometimes
	good for them. Some strains have a large likelyhood that
	they work together with humans. e.g Mother, Alliance Builder,
	Puppetier, Parent and Peacemaker.

	Anytime war is in the system (blackwar before 1130, or human
	contra virus, or virus contra virus) industrial capital is
	destroyed. Under a certain margin (most systems fall under
	this margin even without war, when trade collapsed) the
	industrial capital is not longer able to produce its own
	maintaince and collapses. According to agricultural capital
	and capacity this will cause starvation. And as any political
	system is only 5 meals away from revolution, riots and
	probately a new (wilds) government and techlevel.

I seem to recall somewhere reading that the Imperium has jurisdiction in
the space between worlds...

If the planet wants more control then that, then they don\'t join the
Imperium. Period. End of story. 

Why would the planet want more control, when they receive the benefit of
protection and trade the Imperium provides?

There\'s nothing to say the planet *can\'t* enforce its laws on its moon,
or any other planet or planetoid in the system. It\'s the _space_ between
worlds and moons that\'s under Imperial Jurisdiction. Why would that be
so hard to accept to a fledgeling member of the Imperium?

Note that there could be provisions made for permanent or semi-permanent
orbital stations, posts, what not. So "Mir" could be defined as being
Terran territory, but any spaceship not docked to it is still under
Imperial Law.

There\'s no reason why the planet couldn\'t run SDB\'s. They are required
to abide by and enforce the Laws of the Imperium, not those of the local
government, when dealing with spacecraft in Imperial Space.

I don\'t see why both wouldn\'t co-exist. (see above)

Me too. But I\'m fairly sure that the intention of Traveller is that the
Imperium has sole jurisdiction over the *space between* member worlds,
and the starport and airspace above and within a certain radius. Laws of
Member Worlds only apply over a very thin "airspace" layer above the
world, and on worlds, moons, planetoids and  permanent stations claimed
by the member world.

Au Contraire. I think the blanket should be the rule, not the exception.
The whole *point* behind the Imperium is, imho, regulation of safe and
unimpeded interstellar trade. If every Gov\'t A+ planet enforces its
wacky laws like "Males may not have navel rings under penalty of death",
and they stop and harrass every Joe Trader that visits the system, how
long would trade with that planet last?

I believe that it will be an extremely rare world indeed that does not
allow Imperial Law to rule, and rule alone, in space. Such worlds are
client states or non-aligned, not member-worlds of the Third Imperium.

Nah! More like the regulation of Airspace. You can\'t annex air. There is
one Federal authority for regulation of air traffic, air safety, etc.
and each state regulates what is on the ground. (Does the US have one
airspace authority?)

If Pysadia is an Imperial world, then Imperial Law rules in space. If
they can\'t afford to patrol it themselves, they can petition the gov\'t
of the Imperium to allocate more resources.

That\'s the way I\'d handle it.

> Boy, it\'s a bitch being low tech and poor, isn\'t it?

Sure can be. But maybe the Pysadians believe that being part of the
Imperium gives them more benefits than the disadvantage of not being
able to enforce its *own* laws in outer space.

Just think of the trade dollars! And tech information and improvement,
and help in patrol and defence...

Remember, as I said before, I\'m sure there are standard "Extradition
Treaties" which come into play when a world joins the Imperium. If
someone commits a serious crime in territory under Pysadian Jurisdiction
(dirtside), I\'m sure the Impies could be authorised (with proper
paperwork) to apprehend and return the offender to the Pysadian
authorities for proscecution under Pysadian law...

The Extradition Treaty may only apply to the system, though. I believe
that the Imperium would only bother tracking down, through other
systems, criminals that violate Imperial laws.

However, perhaps Pysadia would have extradition treaties with some of
its neighbors with similar laws, ideology, close ties...

	No jump space is like a fluid. When you are throwing a ball
	into a fluid, the ball will dive and raise. Most funny the
	more thust you give the ball the deeper it will dive, and
	so faster it will raise. The time is aprox the same.

	No jump space is an event horizon around a ship tunneling
	towards the next mass within a week. Any ship has its own
	event horizon even if theory tell that there is one jump
	space.

Not at all. Murder is also an Imperial offense. Therefore the Pysdian
government could inform the Imperium and the offenders would be
extradited or tried under Imperial law. There would be nowhere to run
from such an offence.

True. Space is big. But the arm of the Imperium is long. :) If there\'s
no Imperial or Pysadian force to apprehend them, then they can\'t get
caught no matter who has jurisdiction.

Absolutely. But woe to those characters if they ever landed on Pysadia
again! The characters are going to get pretty bored tooling around the
system...

You may have made it too easy to enter the starport. If the characters
broke Pysadian law and tried to get away via the starport, I\'m sure
they\'d have to get around the standard security/police check at the
starport door. Like customs. You won\'t be allowed to enter the starport
if you broke local law.

That\'d be an adventure! Break into the starport and hijack your own
ship! Good luck...

> I don\'t know, but I feel that the jurisdiction question is more
> complicated than that.

Ya... well... I don\'t. :) The Imperium\'s only interest is that Trade
between worlds is safe and secure. They\'re not interested in enforcing
piddling local customs. If the Member World is megalomaniac enough to
want complete enforcement of its laws over all of space, then it needs
to join another type of empire... or a support group.

If you were an Imperial Bureaucrat and some Pysadian official called you
and said "He kicked my anola!!! He\'s in that starport somewhere!!!
Extradite him!!!" what would you say?

I\'d say, "I\'m sorry, kicking a monkey -- er AnOWlla -- is not an
Imperial Offence. If you believe the crime is serious enough for
extradition, your options are: A. fill out Form IJS 3423-SA for
inclusion of the crime in the Imperial Judicial Code for future
offences. or B. Petition your local Noble for an Imperial Warrant
demanding Extradition. Have a nice day."

Just my point of view...

Which moon of Saturn was it that when Voyager sent back the first
close-ups, everyone at JPL got the giggles because the thing looked
*exactly* like the death star?

While I admit that the universe is a succession of bad jokes (any cancer
patient would agree with you on that one), AOTR just took it to far for my
taste.. The Ithklur were supposed to be these fearsome warriors that the
Hivers keep around.. almost a Jem\'Hadar type of race.. in my old CT game,
they were eight limbed land sharks (based on what was known about
velocioraptors back then) who thought the Hivers were the greatest for
showing them these really neat ways of killing things, and then giving them
the opportunity to go for it.

Aside:  Picture the K\'Kree reaction the first time they encountered my
version of the Ithklur..  Intelligent, hi-tech, carnivores!!!!

I used to say that the starport is extraterritorial, period.  I\'ve been
reconsidering that.  I think I will be running it that only the
_primary_ port has extraterritoriality.  This way, if the Class E
downport (Kmart overflow parking lot when nothing is in orbit) is the
primary port, it has territoriality.  If we are looking at a Class C, TL
A, Pop 7 world, then there is a highport, and _that_ has is the port
granted extraterritorial rights.

Of course, the best cargo may only be found at the, ahem, downport
(innocent look from the GM).

Fundementally, I feel that extraterritorality is a very important
concept.  Otherwise, half the small ships out there (and _all_ the
mercenary companies) would get nailed on weapons violations everytime
they landed at some podunk starport.

This is where things get a bit more complex.  The starports are
technically Imperial, but they are manned and administered (in trust as
a worst case) by the planet or it\'s representatives.  Even though they
do not control space, the government is going to have lines of
communication to the Imperial beauracracy that runs the port.  And since
those beauracrats _live_ on Psyadi, and want to have good relations with
the community, there is going to be some level of cooperation.

Now I don\'t think that the local gov\'t could do anything extreme, but
requesting that the ship be required to leave the local space (i.e. 100
dia) would not be too extreme.  I can even see where there would be an
administrative process to \'eject\' the ship from the system, that would
require a ship or shuttle to escort them to the jump point and witness
the jump out.

Interesting thoughts...

The original poster wanted something that would last for 200 MYr.
That\'s way toio long for drifiting into the sola.r  system to work - relative position
of the sun and opther stars is utterly unpredictable on those timescales
(basically it\'s one whole orbit around the galaxy; stars all have small random
velocities, so in 200 MYr our sun will be nohere near Alpha Cen and small perturbations
from passing nearby stars will have sent the packages off in random directions.

You also would definitely  need a radio to make the packages noticeable - whic
we\'re trying to avoid since it won\'t work after 200 Myr - and you\'d need hundreds 
of thousands of packagtes to have much chance of one arriving at the right time.

I use CORPS for a couple of reasons.

1> Easy mechanics.  In CORPS, everything is done with a single 10-sider.
The task system is wonderfully simple.  If your skill is higher than the
difficulty, you succeed.  If it\'s lower, there is one simple chart to
determine your roll.  Combat is a bit more detailed, but flows nicely once
everyone is familiar with it.  Combat is also nice and deadly.

The skills work on a tiered system.  You have Base, Secondary, and Tertiary
skills.  You might have Projectile Weapons at 4, Rifle at 2, and M-16A2 at
1.  When firing your \'16, your skill is 7.

2> Detailed characters.  CORPS uses a point-based system for character
development, with numerous advantages and disadvantages.  Many of these
ads/disads are defined in vague terms, allowing a player to define them as
s/he wishes.  For example, a 1pt "Allies" advantage can be a good friend,
or the entire LAPD if you are an officer of the law.  A nice touch is the
granting of extra skill points for writing up a good back story for the
character.

3> Lots of little extras.  There is a great deal of material in the
relatively small CORPS rules.  A mass-combat system, a set of rules for
designing paranormal power structures (magic/psionics/whatever),
campaigning notes, and a decent equipment list.

In general, I find CORPS to be a fast, complete system for role play.  I
don\'t recommend it for munchkins, as the combat system kills the stupid.

For Traveller, I use Brilliant Lances for space combat, and build weapons
using 3G3.  My worlds still use UWPs, but they tend to be hidden behind the
write-ups I\'ve done for Lunion Subsector.  Social Standing is one tricky
bit; but I handled it by deciding that anyone who wished to be a noble
would have to put together a 0pt-package (ads and disads that summed out to
zero) covering both the perks and downside of being a noble.

Any questions?

Here\'s one for you space combat buffs.

Situation:  Bad guy ship is docked with the Harrier, connected by 12
meters of umbilical.  For various reasons, things go bad for the bad guy
ship, and it kicks in its maneuver drives while still docked with our
hero\'s ship.

The umbilical shreds, and the bad guy ship speeds off, pulling 3 Gs. 
The Harrier is dead in space and defenseless, for various reasons.

Bad guy ship decides to blast away at this duck in the water.



Here comes my question.  For reference, I\'m using the RPSPCS Traveller
space combat system, which has 30 minute turns like most Traveller space
combat systems.

I\'m trying to figure out how many to hit throws I can give the bad guy
ship in 30 minutes.

Normally, this is a simple answer--one to hit throw.  But, this is not a
normal situation.  The bad guy ship can take any bearing it wants on the
Harrier, at any range--up to about 15 meters!  The Harrier is dead in
space and cannot maneuver (there\'s no pilot aboard).  The Harrier cannot
fire its weapons, for other reasons (long story and moot to this
question).

Referencing SSDS in Starships, I understand the rate of fire for most
laser weapons in space combat is 100 shots per 30 minutes.  From those
100 shots taken in those 30 minutes, one to hit throw is allowed (it\'s
an abstract system).  And, the target is usually considered to be doing
everything it can to not get it--at least moving!

What I\'m trying to do is take this abstract system and make it more
specific for this particular encounter.  I\'m really trying to find out
how fast the bad guy ship can damage the Harrier.

I could figure out, based on an ROF of 100 per 30 minutes, that the ship
can fire once every 18 seconds.  So, every 3 six-second ground combat
turns, I could give the bad guy ship a shot.

But, this does sound a bit much.  At this range, the shot is automatic
(with all the DMs).  It\'s an Easy task and it cannot be failed.  The bad
guy ship will hit every time.

What do you think you GMs out there.  How should I handle this
situation?  Give the bad guy ship a pop at the character\'s ship once
every 3 combat rounds?

Or should I just let him do one shot, like in regular space combat, now
and once again 30 minutes later?

Kenneth.

There are two problems with  this - the first from game balance, the 
second from actual physics and game rules. 

>
>a ship with TL C EMS can be spoofed
>by a ship with TL D stealth.

The game balance/philosophy problem with this is that Traveller generally has
very minor differences between tech levels once you get past TL9; there
are incremental improvements, and sometimes whole new tchnologies, but there\'s
nothing like the huge advantage that 1990s TL-8 has over 1950s TL-6. 
For example, if one TL advantage awas all you needed to make ships nearly
invisible, the Imperium should hand the Zhodani their turbans during wars.
The rules, as printed in pretty much every edition, support this.

The second part is physics. I did the simulatouns that underly the sensor 
rules in FFS2. It surprised even me how easy it is to see a spaceraft
against the cold background of space. Even in visible light, a 
medium-sized sensor (that can fit on a type S) can see another type S just
by reflected sunlight off the hull at hundreds of thousands of millions of
kiloemters. The *only* way to defeat that is to make the hull black - 
but you have to make the hull very, very, very black to win much distance.
The rules do reflect this - you can buy increasingly good black coatings
at higher TLs - but the opposition can also buy increasingly good sensors 
and also bigger sensors - a fixed near-orbit installation around a moderate
pop world can have a *huge* sensor. 

And that\'s just visible light. The real problem is IR light. Traveller
spaceships generate huge amounts of power. If even 10% of that has to be
reradiated as waste heat, you still have to get rid of a huge amount of power.
Since only a limited amount of surface area is available you end up with
very hot (2000K) radiatiors to dump this heat. A cold sensor in space has
amazing sensitivity to 2000K IR sources. Again, the rules do allow 
higer TL ships to have increasingly sophisticated masking of their radiators
(which mostly means arranging them so all the waste goes in one direction,
which you then turn away from likely enemies) but the sensor\'s advantage
is *so* huge that it\'s hard to imagine maskign winning you back much,
although there are lots of tricks you can pull. 

Take a look at FFS2 and the Definitve Sensor Rules; they have what I consider
a very good model of all this. It does allow improvements with TL but 
not huge ones - much of this is up against the hard limits of physics
rather than engineering.

(Note that jamming/spoofing won\'t help you with not being detected - it\'ll just
make it harder for people to ID you ionce you have been detected.)

OK.  We\'ve spent 1% of the milbudget and covered New York.  That does
not solve the problem for Philladelphia, Detroit, Seattle, Los Angeles
or Dallas.

No matter where you concentrate the money, there will be other holes. 
And if you spend the entire defense budget (or welfare budget, or
whatever budget) then you have stripped one whole sector of your
government services to cover another.

Perhaps a valid question is wether or not the Imperium has a Posse Comitatus

becoming involved in civilian criminal or civil crimes. (Except under certain

In my opinion, CORPS simply has the cleanest, most consistent mechanics
I\'ve seen. Check out the review on Michael Richter\'s Caravan of Dreams
site. The reviews are available in a zip file. I haven\'t got the address
handy, but if you have any difficulty finding it I can e-mail it to you.
(He also reviewed T4 as I recall. Reading the two together gives you an
interesting perspective.)

Here\'s my view, which may not be canonical, and which reflects the 1100s
era.  Jurisdiction" means the authority to exert governmental power
somewhere or over someone or something. 

The Imperium has jurisdiction over the space between the stars.  That
is, (a) jump space and (b) normal space outside a member star system. 
(b) is either a sphere or spheroid with a diameter equal to the orbit of
the farthest planet or a curved solid with that orbit as one dimension
and the other dimension set by drawing a line through the center of the
sun perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic and with a certain
length, like the distance from the center of the sun to the primary
world of the system.  

In addition, the Imperium has ancillary jurisdiction over all starports;
this jurisdiction is ancillary, that is, supplemental and helpful, to
its jurisdiction over jump space and the space outside the member star
system.  

Finally, the Imperium has ancillary jurisdiction over orbital space
around any world belonging to a member state; this ancillary
jurisdiction is exercised jointly with the member state, and often only
one person (a customs officer in a cutter) is exercising that joint
authority.  

Each member state of the Imperium is responsible for defense of its own
system, and runs its own SDB (or whatever) unit.  If the member state
can\'t defend itself adequately -- a low-tech world; a border world
subject to raiding; a world with too-frequent pirate attacks -- it can
ask the Imperium for assistance, and the Imperium will provide
appropriate support (training, advisors, technical support, weapon
systems, Marines, intelligence results, fighter squadrons, escort
squadrons, destroyer squadrons, and on up).

Naval and Scout bases are a matter of treaty between the Imperium and
the member state.

> On a related note, how do you determine space juristictions over

Bear in mind these issues, which I won\'t discuss in detail:
(1) a star system in which one planet has multiple sovereign entities.
(2) a star system in which different planets are each sovereign
entities.
(3) a star system in which different planets have multiple sovereign
entities.  

In my view, each sovereign state in the Imperium is a member state,
whether coterminous with a star system or not.  The Imperium has a
treaty with each member state that defines its jurisdiction in space. 
In terms of system defense, the Imperium encourages the formation of
United Nations-type organizations to raise and maintain defense forces,
and provides assistance as necessary.

Mainly yatches in the Carribean and Mediterran.  In the South China Sea
it\'s mainly small merchant ships and refugee boats.  However, wasn\'t there
a fairly large freighter taken in the mid 70\'s..one that US Marines
recaptured?

As for the worth/size of the ships being hijacked...well, they aren\'t
multi-million dollar freighters so there might not be a direct comparison.

One point to keep in mind is that, even in a straight Imperium game, the
conditions will change over time.  Piracy might be common in 50, rare in
100, common again during and shortly after the civil wars, rare again by
1050, etc.  If you aren\'t playing an Imperium game then piracy is as rare
or as common as you want.

1 persent of what? You must understand i am just a layman, and a simple one

What happens if the matter part is the one hitting the antimatter in high

</LURK>

Well, first let me say that I agree with what Douglas wrote 100%! The task
system in CORPS is simple (and you don\'t have to use the chart if you don\'t
want to, since it all reduces to a simple equation), and the rule book has
lots of detail (every time I look through the book I find at least one
thing that I didn\'t know was there, or that I had forgotten about) for
those that want it. I have to admit the combat system is perhaps the most
daunting part - it is fairly detailed (without resorting to charts) and may
not suit some people. My players tried it, and then asked for something
simplier. I don\'t doubt that if everyone knew the combat rules well that
combat would run smoothly - its just learning the combat rules that is the
problem.

If there are any areas that CORPS isn\'t perfect, I would say it would be
the handling of animals. Unfortunately there is no info on animals at all
(although it is easy enough to work out your own methods), although there
is a supplement due out soon that will cover this in a _lot_ more detail.
Magic and cyberware (not really applicable to Traveller) could also have a
bit more info given. The book gives design rules for working out the
character costs (when generating characters) for having either, but doesn\'t
give many examples.

Finally, the biggest advantage for me is that the system is general. I\'ve
used it with a modern day setting (which it was originally written for) the
typical fantasy setting (magic, monsters, etc), and I will be using it to
run Traveller next year. This means that my group doesn\'t have to learn a
new rule set every time we decide to try something different.

All in all, a very nice system. Written by Greg Porter, produced by BTRC
(http://members.aol.com/~btrc).

Greg prides himself when it comes to CORPS and rolling dice.  He designed
it so that when playing, the number of required die rolls is kept to a
minimum.  "Why should a roleplaying game rely /so/ much on little random
number generators, anyways?"

Auto successes are also part of CORPS.  If a character has Swimming-3 and
is confronted with a swimming task with a difficulty of 3 (CORPS uses
numerical designators for difficulty levels, instead of descriptive
adjectives like T4), the task is *automatically* successful.  If it were a
difficulty-4 task and the character did something to gain a +1 modifier,
the task would again be *automatically* successful.  There are a few
exceptions to this rule (most of them in the Combat section) but you get
the gist.

The extra points earned for writing up a decent character background is one
of the *best* little features of CORPS, IMHO.  Pure genius!

The only problem is that-- as a point balanced system-- traditional
Traveller players may have a problem with a character generation system
that doesn\'t roll up skills and stat improvements on a year-by-year basis.

You forget that Guns! Guns! Guns! (3G3) meshes *perfectly* with CORPS,
since they are both BTRC products.  The same will most certainly be true of
Greg\'s upcoming Vehicle Design System, although I haven\'t actually seen it
yet.

You also forgot to mention that CORPS supplements actually have
*reasonable* prices, have few spelling mistakes, and are nicely laid out as
well :)

CORPS is actually the only RPG I own that actually defines munchkins as
something other than residents of Oz.  It appears that Greg has something
against munchkins and attempts to stress realistic roleplay whenever
possible.  He even included a small "you know if you\'re a munchkin if..."
write-up in a section describing the different types of role players.

Interesting.  I hope GURPS: Traveller handles SOC in a similar manner.
Simply paying 15 (or whatever) character points to be a prince is a bit of
a cop-out.

Ideal for attacks that take place at range, where foot and hand wounds are
just as likely as central torso hits.  It also works well for explosives,
burst fire, shotguns, etc.

Now this one works well for melee attack ranges, where leg hits aren\'t as
likely as arm hits (even though legs are physically much larger than arms).
Considering a person often defends himself with his hands while in melee,
they might verywell have a higher likely hood of receiving damage than even
the torso location (as your breakdown suggests).

This one is also nice for ranged combat, although it doesn\'t treat the legs
as being a significant part of a human silhouette.  Still, if you are
aiming a rifle at a person\'s chest, his arms are generally in that vicinity
as well.  Now that I think about it, this option is probably better than
#1.

Please post your To-Hit charts while you\'re at it.

Well, it didn\'t define it as well as I hoped, but here is the summary.

From the ground to 1/10 orbit, military jurisdiction falls under the Army. 
 Close Orbit and Airspace Control Command (COACC), under the Army, defends 
to that point then the regular Navy takes over.  They man the deep Meson 
sites, the atmospheric interceptors, and the orbital defenses.

Basically, COACC defines the planets military control (out to 1/10 orbit). 
 This is separate from a planet\'s legal jurisdiction, though.

I have dim memories of a news item, or some current affairs program that
was about piracy. On this program I think even the big freighters were bing
hit, but only having a small proportion of their cargo taken.

Piracy in a ships boat?

I haven\'t found a good enough opinion to steal yet :)

But seriously:

Yeah, that\'s what worries me, I get this insistent \'Travellers OK really!\'
pouring from the mailing list.... ...but I still think T4\'s has crashed
and is going to burn... I\'d love to support it but I hear more and more
\'this book is broken like the rest\' rather than  \'this book brings
something new and exciting to the Traveller universe and has only 3
typos...\'. 

I can\'t recommend T4 to anyone and not feel guilty about giving them a
raw deal (No, I\'m not a store owner...).

I\'d choose Bubblegum Crisis (ok so I\'m biased on that one), Cyberpunk,
Shadowrun and GURPS over T4 right now (haven\'t poked through Heavy Gear
because I\'m a Battletech supporter).

Of course I\'m the only one around here with TNE & MT (Although I\'ve heard
of someone with MT & a little bit of CT) so my pals see me as the SF freak
with this god-like game of epic gearhead proportions (don\'t quote me on
that).

<collective groan from TML>

Does anyone have an opinion on when the Imperial rules of war were formalised?

I ask in relation to this thread because privateering may  be a legal way
of one world expressing it\'s dissatisfaction with another worlds policies,
if the rules of war have not been formalised yet. I know that this sort of
behaviour will definately be frowned upon by the imperium, but does anyone
think that worlds could get away with it?

Also, I have a query about the idea of planetary navies and the territorial
limits of a planet.  (I seem to remember from COACC that it was the 1/10th
diameter limit, which is well above the atmosphere, I think)

Are the SDB\'s of a planetary navy run by the Imperium or by the local
defence forces?

If it\'s the locals, do you think they have special permission to operate in
Imperial space? (ie, beyond the 1/10th limit)

If it\'s the Imperium, this permission must be recprocated, to allow the
SDB\'s access to the ocean?

Going along on this theme of territorial space.... are the systems minor
worlds and gas giants the property of the Imperium or the planetary
government? 

I know that the planetary governments can maintain colonies on other worlds
in the system, but who is responsible for the legal details (policing,
defence, etc) on the planets and moons that do not have a population within
a system?

Anyones opinions on this matter will be greatly appreciated (it will help
me with details I might not have thought of.)

Why wouldn\'t the bulkhead be superdense too, it is superior to hard

IIRC in Classic Traveller interior bulkheads & hulls each took 1,000
points of bullet dammage or 100 points of energy dammage to cut a person
sized hole in.  This suggests that interior bulkheads have the same
armor factor as the hull.  Interior walls wer thinner & took 100 points
from bullets to cut a hole in

Why don\'t you use the TNE rules for hull thickness with the TNE armor
value (40) of the ship to determine how thick the hull will be. In TNE\'s
FF&s 1 (pg 10) armor value = thickness x toughness(FF&S 1 pg 38)
		40         = ?	       x 14

The hull of the March Harrier is therefore 2.857cm thick.  Describe it
to the players as "a little over an inch" and you\'ll be fine.

You can use this same system to figure bulkhead thickness.  Just decide
on how strong (TNE armor value) it is, what it is made of (find the
toughness), & divide.

At this point I should note that the CSC does give different values for
the toughness & density of Superdense.  The TNE numbers match the MT
numbers.

R/E your earlier question about where the planets extrality limit is
COAAC may not help you.  COAAC says (diagram on pg 7) that the COAAC
patrols up to the 0.1 diameter limit and the Navy patrols beyond this
limit.  However it could well be the _planetary_ navy patroling at 0.1
diameter so this does not prove that the planet has no authority beyond
th 0.1 diameter limit.

    'month' => '10',
    'index' => 'by976',
    'body' => 'I thought I\'d share my arrangements for handling extrality in my campaign.

1. The starport is Imperial territory; the Imperium has criminal and
commercial jurisdiction (which means that any contract that you sign within
the extrality line is governed by Imperial commercial law, not by local
law). Extrality emerged as a solution to the difficulties of sorting out
the conflicts in commercial and criminal law during the early centuries of
the Imperium and provides a way for merchants and travellers to interact
with only a single body of laws as they travel from world to
world--extrality is part of the glue that binds the Imperium together. All
worlds with A and B starports have extraterritorial starports. Almost all
worlds with C starports do as well, and even D and E starports will often
have at least a building that is surrounded by an extrality line (makes
contracts much, much easier for all involved).

2. The extrality line is not so much a border as a boundary (more like the
property line outside a Federal building, not the US-Mexico border).
Planetary authorities will be able to undertake hot pursuit across the line
under most circumstances; arrangements will be made in each system to cover
local laws. As a general rule, extrality lines will delay, not stop,
pursuit by local authorities. If local authorities are pursuing you for a
major crime, they\'re unlikely even to pull up as they pass the extrality
line.

3. The local government has the right to exercise control over all shipping
within the system and to enforce local laws and regulations in space; this
includes the right to undertake health and safety and customs inspections.
In addition, Imperial ships can enforce the Imperial Laws of Space
(restrictions on weaponry, etc.). Ships belonging to any government are
obliged to take action if they detect imminent threats to navigation.

4. Startown is a rough neighborhood for many reasons, but most importantly
because Imperial criminal law is not extensive; most of the corpus of
Imperial law concerns commercial matters (there are for, example, eight
clauses in the Imperial Codex concerning murder and fifty eight extensive
clauses detailing the crime of barratry and the apportionment of
responsibility among the officers involved). There is no regulation of
"morals." Piracy, outside of registered tradewars, is a violation of
Imperial criminal law, and effective pirates are almost certain to violate
any number of provisions of Imperial commercial law.

5. If a traveller commits a crime outside the extrality line, that crime is
considered a violation of local law only, even if the same act, if
committed inside the extrality line would be considered a violation of
Imperial criminal law. The Imperial authorities will allow the suspect to
be extradited and will not interfere with hot pursuit, but will not
prosecute the suspect.

6. Local governments are forbidden from seeking to enforce their local laws
in areas under the jurisdiction of other governments; they cannot dispatch
official agents to apprehend individuals who are accused of purely local
crimes. They are, however, permitted to offer rewards for the delivery of
suspects.

7. The Imperium can, at its discretion, assume jurisdiction over an act
that violates Imperial law, even if that act takes place outside the
extrality line. It does not do so very often, but if it does, one\'s life
gets very interesting.

8. If you violate Imperial Criminal Law (by, for example, killing someone
in a starport with witnesses around), you\'re in bad shape. Your identifying
characteristics will be disseminated to all A and B starports using the
xboat network and you\'ll find thing like making ship payments extremely
interesting.

That\'s enough for tonight.

This is exactly the same situation. You can never judge which one of the
objects is moving (or if both are). You can only use a point of reference,
in this case the target or the firing ship are the most likely points to
consider static. Every velocity is relative, and can only be measured using
a point of reference.

Consider a car driving at 100 km/h. This velocity is measured using the
Earth as a point of reference. But the Earth is orbiting the Sun at an
enormous speed, and the Sun orbits the galaxy center ... the velocity using
other points of reference is different.

A non-canon Traveller universe where on the far side of K\'kree space

I dug out my copy. After going thru the whole thing, I found the
following "boundaries"/ranges:

1/10 diameter	Close Orbit. This is the boundary between COACC and
		space navy jurisdiction
50,000 km	range of deep meson sites
500,000 km	Far Orbit. Any hostiles inside this range will be
		engaged by missiles from orbital forts.

I\'d say that the "orbital forts" count as "shore batteries" did in the
old days on Earth. So 500,000 km is the limit of planetary sovereignty.

So? Why is that "too many" ships? Consider how many freighters there
are on Earth\'s oceans. Surely the average planet can generate such a
*small* fraction of that number as shipments in/out?

Consider, 570/2 is 285. Divide by 7 gives a bit over 40. So there are
40 or 80 ships "in transit" to or from the jump point at any given
time.  The rest are landed or docked, while they load, unload, dicker
for cargo, etc.

I think 40 departures a day is pretty reasonable for an "average" planet.

Don\'t use a space combat system. At those ranges, it just plain doesn\'t
apply.

Use the "vehicle" combat system. That is, treat it like the starship
firing at a tank approaching it while both are on the ground, or the
tank firing at it. Most of the tactical combat systems have entries for
starship weapons and starship armors in them.

The *original* limit (right up until mid century) was 3, 5, or 7 miles.
I forget which. But the *basis* for the old limit is the important part.

It was set by the max range of shore based artillery. So basicly, your
"sovereignty" extended as far as your guns could reach. I think that\'s
a good place to start from.

So what\'s the max range of a planet based weapon? I seem to recall it
being 30 hexes. And that\'s about 70 diametes for a size 8 planet.

Though I\'ll also admit that the 100 diameter limit has to be the "max"
range, as there\'s no *practical* way to do anything about someone
popping in out there, doing something, and then jumping out again.

So I\'d suspect that the official limit is 100 diameters.

Remember, the "houses" are *worlds*. The "cops" are SDBs. A world
("household") can afford a *lot* of SDBs.

The real problem is that people don\'t grasp how *big* a planet is. Nor
do they grasp how *exposed* space is. They try to scale things up from
everyday experience and it doesn\'t work. 

Don\'t say the numbers are wrong unless you can show an error in the
math. Just because they "feel" wrong, that doesn\'t mean anything. Not
when dealing with an area outside everyday experience.

How many worlds are there around the Imperium which are just \'nominal
members\'? To my knowledge, those that aren\'t run directly by Imperial nobles
are pretty much free to do as they like, aren\'t they. So pirates might be
able to operate a base on such a world, provided that they don\'t act too
blatantly, and assuming that they have the appropriate government contacts
to ensure that should the Imperium come looking, (a) their presence is
denied and, later, (b) any extradition treaty is ignored/delayed to allow
their escape. If this hypothesis allows pirates to operate from a much
larger array of bases (rather than having to hide in asteroid belts and in
uninhabited systems), then might it not improve the likelihood of their
existence?

As an example, there was a classic Traveller adventure called "The Sable
Rose" in the old White Dwarf magazine which covered a covert Imperial
Marines strike on a pirate base within a night club in the centre of a city.
Since the city\'s rulers weren\'t admitting any knowledge of the pirate group,
and the Imperials didn\'t have sufficient direct evidence to try an
extradition, the covert team was sent in... this not only sounds like a nice
semi-canon source, but also opens up a lot more adventure opportunities than
just having all pirate bases in deepest darkest space... :-)

Taking this one step further, suppose a world prefers to use starport
taxation to pay for piracy protection, rather than its own world\'s taxes.
This might be particularly appropriate for smaller worlds off the beaten

Either your fuel fees, berthing fees, etc. could all be huge, to pay for
those couple of SDBs sitting in orbit, or you can skimp - perhaps refuelling

Taking this another step, take today\'s medical insurance as an example.
Unless you pay your monthly \'insurance\' fees (perhaps more comparable to a
motoring support organisation such as the AA or RAC in the UK) then you
don\'t get SDB protection on lesser worlds.

No more than the government of (say) Antigua could do to some American
tourists who did the same. Once the hit international waters, the
Antiguans would have to apply to the US to get them extradited.

Yep. If I break some religion based law in Iran, get out of the
country, and then start taunting them, they can\'t do a thing about it. 
(Except offer a reward for my assassination). Ask Salmon Rushdie about
that.

As a practical matter, your jurisdiction ends at the point where you
are unable to enforce it. Pysadi doesn\'t *have* the capability of
reaching someone in orbit. 

As a legal matter, things aren\'t a lot different. Consider the guy
being tried for arson in California. His fire killed several firemen,
and he\'d normally be tried for murder. But he was extradited from
Brazil(?) and the *Brazilian* court that ruled on the extradition ruled
that he could only be tried for arson. So California had a choice
between letting him get away, or just trying him for arson.

Given that *current* containers are designed for rough seas, and being
stacked 10 deep, this shouldn\'t be too hard.

More important is to remember that many *cargos* will have max g loads.
Pull too many gees and that container of lightbulbs is full of broken
glass. This sort of thing would be listed on the manifest, so the crew
would know it.

I expect that some pirates will take advantage of this. If they can
manage to sabotage the ship\'s g-comp, the captain has a choice between
trying to evade at much reduced acceleration (and risking loss of the
cargo) or letting the pirates have it.

Also, current containers come in "half" and even (rarely) quarter-size

I rather expect that the "locking" mechanisms will be hydraulically
operated. As will much of the "handling" system. So you can operate
things manually, but it\'d take a while. You\'d hook something like a
grease gun up to the appropriate fitting and then pump the handle until
you\'d built enough pressure to operate the lock. Then move onto the
next pin. After that, you start pumping the *big* lever for manually
operating the "ram" that pushes the container...

It\'s doable, but not much fun.

One thing to remember is that starships are not "mass produced" except
in *rare* cases. A thousand of the same model ship is a *big* run. That
means that parts aren\'t all that interchangeable. At least not at the
"major sub-assembly" level (j-drive, M-drive, power plant). Some of the
*parts* of those assemblies may be standard.

Due to the lack of standardization, just as with modern *ships*, you
are more likely to *rebuild* a part than to *replace* it. You can\'t
just walk into a dealer and order a framistat for a Spofulam Industries
jump-drive from a model XXX freighter. And even if you can, how long
will it take to ship one to you?

Remember, there are a *lot* of ships, and they are mostly *different*.
That\'s a consequence of the fact that they are expensive. 

When a modern day ship breaks a part, they dig the specs out of the
files and machine a new one....

We do have some "standards" (like the standard components from the ship
design systems) and reality is likely to be that way to some extent.
But even if you ship was built from all standard parts, there\'s the
matter of how commonly used those standard parts are. If it\'s standard,
but uncommon, you may have a wait and it may not be available used/stolen.
If your ship is "custom", you are likely to *really* be in trouble.

Of course, if you are a Type S scout, parts are *easy* to find... :-)

What I\'m trying to get across is that ships *aren\'t* cars. And that
*does* make a difference.

There\'s a *big* difference between "a few million km" and the 100
diameter limit. It is extremely *unlikely* that there\'d be any
asteroids within the 100 diameter limit at any given time. Unless they
happend to orbit the planet.

Any such asteroid passing through would get *close* attention, if only
because of the threat it poses to the planet. And shooting them doesn\'t
really reduce the danger. Then you have to worry about the pieces.

Most likely, anything with an orbit that\'d pass close to the 100
diameter limit would have been detected *decades* in advance. And most
likely gently nudged into a "safer" orbit. Or, if it was feasible, it
might get nudged into an orbit around the planet (it\'d be useful for a
lot of things).

Only if they are willing to devote a few *years* to the project. Normal
"spacewatch" will have identified all the natural bodies of any size
within a few AU. Anything that appears out of nowhere will be very
suspicious. And asteroids move at fairly slow speeds by Traveller
standards. So you\'d have to go into your shell and then spend anywhere
from 6 months to a couple of years waiting until you got into position.

Remember, for that sort of disguise to work, you have to look like a
*normal* asteroid. And they can see those 6 months to several years
before they get close enough to worry about.

Well in the Traveller Adventure (in the Pysadian episode no less) it is
stated that:

"Pysadi is a member of the Imperium. In theory that means that anyone who
breaks Pysadi\'s laws and then flees the world *must* (emphasis mine) be
pursued by Imperial authorities and extradited to Pysadi. In practice,
Imperial authorities will not devote effort to searching for thoe who
violate any local laws which are considered to be barbaric or irrational
by the mainstream of Imperial society." (page 58).

I think that pretty much sums things up; steal an Anola and flee and you\'ll
probably get away with it. Kill a priest in the process of stealing an
Anola and your in trouble.

As to the ship hovering above the world. I think the Pysadians could make
a reasonable case for this being an act of intimidation at the very least,
or failing that a hazzard to navigation, or failing that a hazzard to the
environment (imagine parking a 737 for an indefinite period over a major
city) etc. Basically there are ways and means of getting them to move along.

I think your players should start looking for a new ship. Sitting there,
firing on an immobile, defenseless target isn\'t combat...the gunners get
maximum fire and the easy firing solution you came up with...firing on the
Harrier every three combat rounds, and the Harrier will be reduced to itty
bitty metal and plastic bits in fairly short order.

Now, _why_ do the bad guys want to destroy this perfectly good ship
sitting there for the taking? That\'s the question you should be asking
yourself...

Precisely...they\'re coming aboard the freighters and taking the high value
cargo. IIRC the prates in the china sea are using fast, shallow draft 
boats, armed mostly with small arms, and attacking the unarmed small
merchants.

In the 3I, it\'d more likely be piracy by small SDB...why does anyone think
the pirates aren\'t going to eventually get the same things that the good
guys have? Where do you think all those surplus TL-10 SDB\'s from the
recent THUDDD are going to go when their pocket empires get swallowed by
the 3I?

I thought that was the whole line of reasoning behind the \'standard\'
ship types (SSDS and QSDS design formats), so that the industrial
planets could ship out standard parts to shipyards all around a sector. 
The actual number of components may differ (this J-drive needs 5
harmonic inducers instead of 4), which explains the variation in volume,
but the parts are \'off the shelf\' standard.

Even in modern ships there are a lot of interchangable parts.  Even the
reduction gear for a gas or steam turbine ship can be swapped out
between ships of the same basic class (I am speaking toward warships,
the only ones I really know), but below the huge part level, almost
everything is pumps, piping, control circuitry, etc; that is
interchangable.

But again, it is my understanding that ships built from the standard
shipbuilding templates _can_ find parts, regardless of their location. 
Otherwise, to repair damage you would have to rebuild large sections of
the ship, or get it back to a shipyard that has access to the parts and
plans of the original builder.

O.K., I should have read the entire post before I started my reply.  I
still disagree to a certain extent.  Standardization is not something
that is being driven by the manufacturers (like the DVD \'standard\').  It
is something, IMHO, that was imposed by the Imperium to facilitate
trade, not to mention support for the fleet.  If the IN deploys a CruRon
out of sector, that CruRon has got to be able to depend on the local
starports for resupply and repair, or it is going to spend a lot of time
in orbit.  Standardization of ship components is the _only_ way to be
able to do this.  Otherwise, the supply lines to the various squadrons
would become so convoluted and require so much support that the IN would
collapse.

But I agree that a custom ship could have some serious difficulty in
those areas that it deviates from standard.

Sendmail is a pain in the butt.  We got a backlog over the weekend that 
exceeded some 9000 messages.  I would run the mail queue by hand (there were
0 errors being logged other than the normal bounces) and it would do a couple
of hundred messages and skip the rest.

Well yesterday I figured it out!  My load avergage was climbing to a point 
where sendmail would stop processing the queue.  So, I made some tweeks and
things got better, but not well enough.  So I made another change over 
night and our mailq is back down to something reasonable.  

As an effect, if you can find this message buried in the middle of the some
8 TML digests and some 200 tml messages that just got pumped out . . .

Hrmmm....that _does_ beg the question, though. Shoemaker-Levy, IIRC,
mostly burned up in (comparatively) the upper atmosphere. What would
happen if you set off a fusion warhead waaaaaay down in the atmosphere? 
Say near the part where the hydrogen starts turnng metallic?  Would the
pressure be enough to sustain a fusion reaction? Or at least make the
fusion reaction that _does_ occur go on a lot longer and be a lot bigger

It would take a _really_ big, hardened warhead, but wow what you could do.

I understand how big a world is.  I also understand what kind of
infrastructure is needed to support a warship, what kind of rest and
rotation crews need, and how difficult it is to support that away from a
permanent base structure.

You are correct.

However, while the numbers say that you can put X SDBs around every
mainworld, the support structure (which is also laid out in canon) says
you cannot support them.

To use the example, that is like saying there are 500 cops for every
household, but only 1 police station per burrough.  The infrastructure
to support that kind of force is not in place, except in one sector.  

Allow me to direct your attention to the Sword Worlds.  Why do you think
there is a Base on virtually every world in that sector?  Because you
need the infrastructure in place to support a permanently based system
defense, in the absence of the technological/industrial/population base
in that system.

I believe the following procedure should work for converting FF&S T4 version
(FF&S2) armor ratings to T4 armor rating

First: Divided the FF&S2 armor rating by 1.43
       (this converts the from FF&S2 rating to the original FF&S rating)
Second: Use the USP Conversion Chart from SSDS to get the USP rating
Last: Multiple the USP by 10 to get the final T4 armor rating

Well, I\'m of the opinion that deck layouts can be different for the same
class of ship.  Not all Type R Subsidized Merchants will have the same
deck plans, although externally, they look pretty much the same.

At the time of construction, you can lay your bulkheads out in various
ways, allowing you to go with one of the standard interior layouts, or
design one of your own.  This is similar to building a house i.e. the
bridge and engineering will be in the same place on all Type R\'s, but
you can play around with the common areas.

Given this, I was thinking hard steel would be a better choice.  I could
be convinced to use another material for the bulkheads--which is why I
asked this question.

Yes, I looked at this in Snapshot, which is why I went with Hard Steel.
They are suggesting you can take your laser pistol and cut through the
bulkhead by doing 100 points of damage.  A cheap laser pistol does 4D
damage, so you are looking at holing the wall in about 42 seconds (about
7 combat rounds) and completely cutting a man-sized hole to walk through
(not an interior wall) in about 7 minutes.

To me, that sounded more like hard steel rather than superdense.

This is a good idea--and I can easily convert it to CSC T4 values.  MT

This is good. I always try to impress upon my players how deadly weaponry
should be. I sometimes think they suffer from what I call "the 10th-level

ability to take massive amounts of damage in hit points before you die?

Interesting. So the CORPS system is diverse enough to manage the skills of
Traveller characters. Do you just insert skills like Pilot, Astrogation,
Gravitics, etc.?

I\'m considering running a 3D Interstellar Wars era campaign with lots of
departures from canon, and I may well develop my own UWP system as well. I
will use NASA\'s "Views of the Solar System" site
(http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/) as one resource.

Thanks for the info, Doug.

Well, I could point out that CT (book 2, starships) was pretty clear
that a ship, running silent, was undetectable to 100,000 miles in deep
space, and 10,000 miles in orbit.  Unfortunately, that is the same book
that tells us that jump torpedoes are canon...  :(

I do think, however, that detection of a ship in \'stealth\' mode should
be a function of 1) size (a smaller ship is more likely to elude
detection than a large ship), 2) numbers (ie a squadron is more likely
to be detected than a lone ship) and 3) environment (dust cloud,
asteroid belt, etc.)

It is more than just piracy here.  We are eliminating a large chunk of
adventuring here.  To say that from the moment a ship jumps into a
system it falls under the watchful eye of the \'benevolent\' Imperial
Navy, until it is handed over to the local custom inspector kills a
whole range of potential adventures (from smuggling to grey ops).  Even
when I have sensors placed, I have allowed for jamming/spoofing from
military sensor suites, stealth technology to avoid detection, and
gathered intelligence to determine weak spots in the sensor grids.

I very much disagree that eliminating this sector of technology
\'balances\' the game.

Again, I am not an expert here.  I can\'t give specific examples to
offset yours.  I would say that, generically, improvement in heat
dissapation technology might allow a Sensor Operator to route the waste
energy to specific radiators to mask thier radiation, and provide extra
coolant (gee...LHyd?) to the unmasked portion of the hull to cool it.

Please note, this is a off-the-cuff suggestions for one possibility. 
I\'m not even going to _try_ to defend it.  I\'m just trying to suggest
that, as currently happens, when one side devises a detector, the other
side devises a counter.  And that the R&D of the large military powers
(the ones with the real money) will be the ones to develop the
technology.  (It\'s the stainless steel rats that will steal it...)

I\'m going to treat this as a serious rumor, because I\'ve heard more bizarre

    'body' => 'The Imperium requires that all member worlds uphold Imperial law. Now, if
wearing blue shoes on a tuesday is illegal in the Imperium, it probably
isn\'t worth enforcing that law on Blogvit, a law 0 world which has no
Tasteful Clothing Law, unless there\'s some special reason. Far more likely,
the Tasteful Clothing Law won\'t apply to sovereign states within the
Imperium since it\'s quite obviously Not Important Enough To Worry About.


BUT: Certain laws are Important Enough. They form the foundation of the
Imperium and each world must agree to uphold Imperial Law if it is to
become a member. The fact that a particular world has no specific law
against a particular act is irrelevant. That world has agreed to uphold
Imperial Law. If they don\'t they\'re not members.


Piracy is an Imperial Felony, or whatever the term is. That particular law
will be enforced very harshly since the pirates don\'t just sit on the
ground saying, \'Aaagrh matey, we\'s the baddest there is!\' (if they do then
the Imperium probably won\'t bother about that either since although it\'s
still a major crime it\'s not affecting anyone and thus isn\'t worth
bothering about.) Our Real Pirates don\'t just sit about debating whether
their trade is possible or not (!), but go out raiding and disrupting
commerce (or get blasted by sysdef command, depending on which side of the
debate you\'re on.)

The Imperium is going to take direct action against the pirates if they
become a nuisance, and will act against the *world* as well (harbouring
piracy is a direct contravention of the Imperial code of membership.)
Sanctions will be applied (blockade, governmental fines, withdrawal of
services), on an increasing basis. Eventually this might be a full military
\'police action\' if the problem gets out of hand.

There are adventure hooks here - perhaps a world hires private adventurers
to deal with the pirate problem before the Imperial Intervention is
triggered - perhaps the characters are sent to trigger that intervention -
perhaps the characters are part of the Pirate orgainisation and need to get
out sharpish before the Imperial Spike Teams land (covertly, without
official sanction so the world govt can\'t whinge). Or perhaps the poor sods
are just in the way as the Imperial Police Action starts. I now which idea
appeals most to me. 

Essentially, if you harbour pirates then you\'re breaching the Imperial
Charter. Your rights as a member are withdrawn since you obviously don\'t
want membership - as proven by your own actions. Anything that happens to
you from then on is your own problem and your own fault.

Fascist?Me?

Which brings me neatly to another topic I need info on:


Does anyone know when SolSec was founded. I guess sometime after 9PM,
intended to hold back the Long Night by harsh and deniable action wherever
needed. I can\'t find a reference in the Solomani book. Is it in the DGP
version?

Any help would be appreciated.
Martin.

I\'ve always had trouble distributing over in the USA - The magazine is 40 A4
pages plus with additional material (such as subsector data etc) in black
book size. We mainly deal in backgrounds, contacts, equipment (mostly
non-military - or civilian adaptable) and adventures primarily aimed at
referees. Its a bit large for Airmail and I didn\'t have large enough market
over there to warrent mass mailing.

Andy Lilly, of BITs & Core (co-author of  \'The Long Way Home\') described SGK
as:

>>Signal-GK has continued (albeit irregularly) to produce excellent quality
work covering alien worlds, alien beings, cultures, adventures, etc.
(primarily in the Dagudashaag sector) over a number of years. Liaison with
HIWG in previous years means that the Dag\' data encompasses and expands upon
the \'canon\' Traveller background of the CT and MT era

David Johnson (of the excellent Melbourne Times Fame) said >>Y\'all are doing
as good a job, in terms of quality as Challenge and Travellers
Digest/Megatraveller Journal

Alan Huscroft said >> I\'ve finally finished reading through SGK, along with
all the extra bits and pieces that go with it. Whew, you don\'t skimp on the
material do you?

You may well have read material from SGK and not been aware of it: Hubworlds
in NE started out in SGK, the Scanians in \'Long Way Home\' was first detailed
in SGK 1 and some of our Aslan variants from SGK 2 were mentioned in
 Solomani & Aslan. Some library data from SGK was reprinted in Imperiallines
5.

Advert over..  This may well be the last issue - 13 as we have now detailed
the entire Dagudashaag Sector (with a great deal of help from  BITs) though
I\'m hoping to set up a website in the near future and we are trying to get
permission to publish the entire Library data, our contact articles and our
referees materials and Port of Calls as supplements.

I currently have a few copies of  11 & 12 left and they cost three pounds
fifty each. I cannot handle US currency though I will accept International
Reply Coupons to the current exchange value..

Many earlier issues are now worth well above their original value (an issue 1
recently sold for twenty pounds at a English shop! Ah, fame..)

>>>Is there anyone out there who has any decent adventures, port of calls or
articles that they would like to see in print? 

>>Is the material you are looking for similar to what appeared in early JTAS,
Far Horizons, Traveller Digest..that type material?  What word counts are
you looking for?  What are your policies on copywrite and article reprints?

We are open to most types of material - especially adventures or Traveller
Digest-type articles, If its good and likely to be useful to Referees I\'ll
print it.. We have done 76 patron-type, small cargoes, legends and lores,
news articles, techy articles (how psionics works, stargates, stealth
technology etc..), contact articles etc. Traveller Digest and Far Traveller
are the closest to house style..

Word counts vary - We\'ve done twenty-thirty page articles before if they are
suitable though generally 2 - 5,000 words are the norm. Shorter articles are
also welcome. Appropriate artwork is also extremely helpful, maps etc. Text
file and graphic attachments are welcome though all executable files are
deleted before download (okay, I\'m paranoid!)

Copyright remains with the author though some material - that detailing
library data of Dagudashaag Sector primarily becomes the copyright of Signal
GK. Articles set in Dag\' remain the authors though we do ask the right to
reprint it in our planned supplements and our planned website. Most of this
applies to the DDT (Dagudashaag Development Team and pest control) rather
than guests.. Its unlikely that you will be detailing something in the Dag\'
so it would remain your copyright and if we wanted to use it again we\'d need
to get your permission again..

     Some of you know that I\'ve been porting the ttg libraries to java. The
task is largely complete now. It even has (most of) the surface generation
from LIBRARY/SYSGEN. The code has been stable enough to start producing a
java version of Jim\'s Galactic.
     You can upload this from
ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/ttg/ttg.jar. Set your classpath to
include this file and then run the GAL class.
     (eg.
     set classpath .;c:\\jdk1.1.3\\classes.zip;c:\\tmp\\ttg.jar
     java GAL
     )
You need a java version 1.1 to run this. (I don\'t think microsoft\'s works,
since the f***ed up their release strategy.) Note: this is a java
_application_ not a java _applet_. Having a java-enabled browser isn\'t good
enough. A good place to start to find java 1.1 for your operating system is
www.javasoft.com.
     I\'ve tested it on Window 95/NT, and on Solaris. I\'m reasonably
optimistic that it will work on other platforms.
     If you have a Galactic dataset (you can upload my reference copy from
ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/trav/classic.zip) you can point javaGal
at it by editing the gal.prp file in the current directory. Just add (or
change) the line DataBase=<path to top dir>. If you don\'t have a data set,
it will generate one on the fly, al la Sysgen.
     The UI is largely inspired by Jim\'s Galactic, but delves into LIBRARY
based UI when it gets deep enough. It isn\'t nearly as fast as Jim\'s DOS
version, nor does it support all the features. Jim\'s will continue to
remain the reference application.
     Although largely functional, it is not yet a finished product. The UI
needs improvement and it is not very good about storing changes you make.
It needs to be able to generate reports. Commentary and suggestions are
welcome from those who actually upload and use it. Particularly in the
following areas:
     * the text of any exceptions generated from the reference data set
     * what ASCII based reports would be useful to have generated and from
what context
     * what you would prefer as menu items and what you would prefer as
mouse activated UI
     * more graphical ways to represent the data
I am not interested in comments from people who have not actually run the
software. Keep in mind that the thrust of this project is to create
canonical traveller data. Ultimately I\'d love to allow for user extensions
(such as small planets in the Trojan points of large planets, etc). But not
right now.
     For those of you interested in the code you can upload the sources
from ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/ttg/ttgsrc.zip. It is relatively
uncommented and subject to change. I am currently adding in javadoc
comments and normalising the API to java standards so that most of the
pieces can be used as beans. When that is complete there will be another
announcement and the doc will be put on-line.
     I now return you to your scheduled programming...

players are new to traveller, indeed, many are new to SF RPGs.  I am
considering ways to start them off without having to spend several hours
explaining the ins and outs of the setting (non-3I, by the way).  So I
intend to have them misjump into a strange sector where the characters
will know little more than the players.
        My questions are these;
        1) How do you others handle misjumps?  E.g. how long do misjumps
take compared to normal jumps and when, if at all, will a starship crew
know they have misjumped while still in jump-space.  This is important
as their ship will appear in a dangerous part of a system and they will
need to get off ship quickly (I\'m hoping to control their options by not
giving them their own starship at first).
        2) What are the effects of jump-space?  During the jump one of
the NPC crew will push the NPC chief engineer out of the airlock as a
crime of passion so will the body still be there?  How will the murderer
react to seeing jump space?
        3) How do you all think that a ship coming OUT of jump-space
appears to any other ships in the area.  How do those aboard experience
it, does the ship jolt, shake. etc.

        I have considered all these points and would welcome other
people\'s views before I define the answetres for my game.

Hrmmm....that _does_ beg the big question, though. Shoemaker-Levy, IIRC,
mostly burned up in (comparatively) the upper atmosphere. What would
happen if you set off a big fusion warhead waaaaaay down in the
atmosphere? Say in part where the hydrogen starts turnng metallic? 
Would the pressure be enough to sustain an ongoing fusion reaction? Or
would \'lighting\' a GG this way simply blow off a lot of atmosphere? Or
just make a big burp?

It would take a _really_ big, hardened warhead, but wow what you could do.

This is the way I have always done it. I can\'t think of a time I have ever

I already said the word "pirates" appears many times in Traveller. That\'s
why I put it in quotes; I was quoting the book. But how many times do the
words "lone shipowners attacking free traders" appear? The encounter tables
don\'t say this. MMT, JTAS, and Traveller Digest don\'t say this. The canon
examples of pirates I could found were fleets of warships and corporate
dirty tricks squads. Why should I assume the pirates in the encounter table
are so different from the pirates in published adventures?

My complaint with the piracy advocates is their use of canon piracy (fleets
of warships from secure bases outside the Imperium) to claim that a totally
different form of criminal activity (local shipowners with armed far
traders) is widespread. I\'m not saying it couldn\'t be, I don\'t have all the
books, I\'m just saying that it doesn\'t logically follow.

I think this is also pertinent to the estimation of the size of a system\'s
defenses. If the typical pirate band was a half-dozen battleships then a
SDB or two would not be effective in stopping it. And this is the size of a
canon pirate band; in Rubicon Cross the pirates of the New Order had more
than "five combat-ready ships with full armament" in the system. The
Castran Marauders and Reavers had fleets rivalling that of a pocket empire.

I can understand why referees want pirates to have only a few small ships;
this lets the players fight them. I just don\'t think such weak "pirates"
are plausible or supported by canon. Unless you\'re playing a Pocket Empires
game even a small pirate band would vastly overmatch any player\'s ship.

Even so, I think one could still successfully incorporate pirates into a
campaign so long as the players don\'t try to confront them directly. In
Rubicon Cross the pirates for some reason decide to send only a single
ship\'s boat to investigate the players. In Lords of Thunder the players can
investigate pirate bases or informers and tip off the Gateway Navy.

They can afford it because of the decisions made by the designers of the
game system.

1.  Starships are expensive, thus there are not very many of them to track.

2.  The area that needs to be covered is pretty small - ~1.5 hours from
planet to jump limit.

3.  A warship that can smash a civilian ship is not sufficiently more
expensive that a civilian ship to make them rare.  (My BOTE calculations
showed that the cost of a merchant ship is roughly 1/3 jump drive, 1/3
maneuver drive, roughly 1/6 power plant, and roughly 1/6 everything else.)
Note that a 95Mj laser is only a megacredit, which is pretty damn piddly
compared to the cost of the drives - a ship carrying 3kt of container cargo
here costs $150M.  A ship doing the same in Traveller costs about 25 times
as much, depending on your $<->Cr conversion.

(By the way, Dave, this does support your piracy contention that targets of
opportunity would be taken - the equipment to do it is cheap compared to
the ship.  We still disagree on where it could be done.)

Point 3 is important - given the low cost of a warship, it is worth
maintaining  a nasty SDB for antipiracy work if it will stop even one
action against ships a tenth its size and cost a year.  If you assume a
large load on insurance, it is still worth doing for three such events.  If
you assume you need ten ships, then it is worth maintaining a fleet of ten
SDBs to prevent one piracy action a year against ships of similar size.

SDBs will also be far cheaper than the ships they attack, because they do
not have that jump drive, which is roughly a third of the cost of a warship.

This is very, very different from today, where warships cost a hell of a
lot, and they have a lot of space to cover.

Now that Leonard E. has fessed up regarding B5\'s use of mass drivers, does 
anyone know if B5 has any Trav2300 influences? While watching the latest 
episode this past weekend, I was inspired to drag out my Starcruiser rules.

I\'m not sure but I think I could use SC to creat a reasonable version of the 
Agamemnon.

Aside from the lack of det-laser missles on B5, lots of the technology seems 
very similar to T2300.

The one thing that annoys me is that B5 allows impact missles to clobber 
vessels defended with beam weapons.

Does anyone have the B5  rules to shed light on these topics.

But what gets real scary is that the speed of light is c no matter what

light from the star will stil be traveling towards you at c. The theory of

Except the Kzinti *always* attack before they\'re ready.  I asked Larry

that without it, the history of KS would have ended with a detailed
description of a few million Kzin feasting on the human race.  I took this
to be a good reason why the Vargr didn\'t overwhelm humaniti during the Long
Night.. they always over-reached themselves.

And merchants that refuel at the gas giant and needs help will be charged

Or you could use the common rescue plot of today. If the people in need of
rescue has operated negligent, the bill for the rescue will be charge
them. A norwegian explorer of the Antarctic was billed over 2 million
kroner, thats about 300.000$ when one of her teammates fell into a crack
and needed to be flown out of there. Anoter incident was two guys that
were going to row from Norway to the Shetland Islands on the coast of
Scottland. Because of poor planning and inadequate equipment they needed
rescue, an operation that took almost a week and required countless hours
of flighttime. The bill, given to the adventurers, were at 11 million
kroners.

This would really discourage gas giant refueling.

I just have to disagree.  The number of items to track is not that large,
and the cost of the things tracked is high, which usually means people will
try.  Every ship has a cost, present day, of several hundred million
dollars, which makes it worth someone\'s time to track.  I was told recently
that a small "yacht" today can be had for a million bucks, and a small
sailboat in the hundreds of thousands.  Thus, there are quite a few of
them.  The high cost of drives indicates fewer ships in Traveller.

Bad data can be put into the record.  There is no question at all, but you
need only have enough good data for you to be found, eventually, and
someone who cares enough to look.  For example, if they have a list of who
claimed to go where, then you would need to pay a clerk to give you an
alibi, which is harder to do after the fact, especially if you are running.
 Sure, you could do it, but it makes it harder, and you had to have a first
split somewhere.

When your ship was purchased, a note was appended to the XBoat traffic
containing the ID information.  This propagated at J5 or so, and eventually
reached the entire Imperium.  If you were speedy, you could easily have
outpaced the information, which would cause the authorities to be
interested in you.  Perhaps not enough to stop you, but they would look
twice, much like driving a red sports car without plates.  The cop may or
may not stop you, but he or she will look, and if there is something
specific, then this might pique their curiosity.

Agreed.  No question, for the reason you mentioned, plus a raft of others,
until someone has need to navigate the system to find data on you.  Once an
act of piracy is reported - an investigator will check your back trail.
You may have enough bad links to break the trail, but they are going to be
motivated to do data searches, given that it costs mostly computer time,
not human time.

You missed one point - I do not claim that they would nail you on the next
jump, but that once they decided they _were_ interested in you, they would
likely get you, unless you kept fleeing at high speed right out of the
Imperium.  After an incident, investigators would, if it was serious
enough, check out all parties involved.  Assume it took a month - you might
be three jumps away.  If they can get enough data to prove that you are the
person to look at, then the message goes out a month behind you, and your
success at staying ahead of that message would vary.

As long as you ran faster than the message, you could make it to the
border, but then you would have a hard time coming back.

If you are driving a new car without plates, police look at you more than
if you are not.  They may not pull you over, but a suspicious act might
just get you stopped, and your life gets much more difficult if you happen
to be driving the same kind of car as was recently reported as having
committed a robbery.

No hit throw needed.  As many shots as he feels like firing will hit at
those ranges, against a non-maneuvering target.

Right.  ANY QSDS/SSDS laser can run at 100 shots per 30 minutes if enough
power is availble.  Some lasers can fire as fast as 800 per 30 minutes (but
most can\'t due to cooling and power problems - generally only warships have
lasers that fire this fast).

Some designs only allocate enough power for a ROF of 10 or 50, though (if
additional power can be had, say, by diverting power from the maneuver
drive) these weapons can also fire at ROF 100.

Right.  A non-evading target at extremely short (under hundreds of km) range
is basically a sitting duck, and should recieve all of the shots fired.

If you want to be realistic about it, the Harrier is toast unless the Bad
Guy decides to stop firing for some reason, and the best bet for the PCs is
probably vacc suits and individual re-entry kits.  You can give them a few
seconds by declaring that the Bad Guy needs to get a few tens of km away
before their fire-control will react sensibly to the Harrier (spacecraft
fire control systems will probably have trouble with targets closer than
that, because normal engagment ranges are in the thousands of km).

Yep.

Pretty much.  This is WHY you surrender when your drive is out and the
turrets aren\'t working.

To put it into familiar terms for your PCs, the Enterprise is dead in space,
the shields are down, and there\'s no power for the weapons.  The Klingons
are pissed off since you\'ve damaged their ship, and they\'re coming around
for another pass with the photon torpedos.  What are the chances of a miss?
What does Kirk do?

(If they don\'t get the hint, have them watch Star Trek III again).

> What do you think you GMs out there.  How should I handle this

Well, what is it that you want to do here, as GM?

Do you want to destroy the Harrier?  Do you want the PCs to surrender (if
they\'re smart, they will)?  Do you want to scare some sense into them?

If you want to destroy the Harrier, it should be possible, no sweat.  An
extremely annoyed Bad Guy ship pounds the hull for as many shots as he
likes, until the largest pieces of the Harrier are little blobs of molten
hull.

If you want the PCs to surrender, have the Bad Guys shoot them a few times,
and then pause and wait for the PCs to surrender.  If they don\'t, then shoot
a few more times.  Repeat until they either surrender abjectly or die of
stupidity.

If you want to give the PCs a good scare, have the Bad Guys pump a few shots
into their hull, and then have the cavalry appear out of jumpspace.  Suddenly,
the Bad Guy has more important things to worry about than putting shots into
a disabled ship that\'s going nowhere.  It\'s a little melodramatic, but it works.

Kenneth,

The way I look at things (somewhat colored through CT) is that most Interior
walls on a star ship are light weight plastics that can be moved and
adjusted as needed, with a number of bulkheads made from approximately 1 cm
thick superdense for support and safety (peirced by iris valves, etc, and
with pressure secure conduits for control runs, Life support conduits are
equipted with automatic chopper valves that close when a section
depressures). I typically seperate the ship into sections such as Control,
Living Quarters, Engineering and Cargo, each independant and seperated from
the other sections by a pressure wall, any walls in these sections are
lightweights and, with more or less effort, removable.

I like this system since I tend to design ships that do dual purpose. Cargo
holds can be turned into passenger quarters by erecting lightweight plastic
walls.

Outer hulls are usally triple the thickness of the inner walls on unarmored
ships and armor adds to that thickness. This thickness is more for sheilding
against impact than structual integrety.

None of this is based on anything scientific, just a general feel.

Relating this to the Real World(tm) though, in the refinery I work in our
largest Crude Oil tank is large enough to set a 747 jet in without touching
the sides. It\'s self supporting rolled plate steel (normal carbon steel), at
the base (I\'ve been told) it is approximately 1 inch thick, tapering to
about 1/2 inch thick at the top of the the tank.

Don\'t know if any of this helps, but there it is.

Sorry, I assumed Glenn was talking about the Piracy thread.  The few times
I dipped into it I found the discussion to be relatively useless (he said,
she said, but this handwave means this and that theory says that...ad
infinitum) and at least a little hostile, in the argumentative sense.  If
there were good spinoffs I wish I had caught them, but in general I saw no
change of the subject line and deleted anything with the word "piracy" in
any form for a long time (including today).

By useful I refer to either actual whole (or draft for discussion) house
rules, vehicle/weapon/ship designs, adventure hooks, play aids, web site
references, works of fiction or reference materials, answers to specific
questions, etc.

I do not consider arguments terribly useful, nor esoteric discussions of
how many black globe generators can fit on the head of a pin, or why a
particular canon historical event or assumption is impossible.  I do not
read into the historical backgound that closely and encourage my players to
not take it too seriously either.  Arguments with no conclusion that
produces a rule or design or playing aid leave me saying "why did I read
all that?".

It lowers that all important "signal to noise" ratio for which this forum
has usually been better than any newsgroup.

That is not to say that they have no place on this list.  I do not wish to
censor or regulate other\'s views nor do I want a moderator to do so unless
there is some abusive or illegal behavior occurring.  The purpose of the
message above was to express my own opinion of the piracy thread and other
\'confrontational\' discussions.

[Disclaimer: I\'m guessing here]

Ok, you\'ve got a turbulent, layered hydrogen/ammonia/helium/etc gas
atmosphere under extreme pressure.  As we know, pressure causes tremendous
heat, and possibly fusion is occurring.  Now add an explosion.  The
explosion would need to be tremendous to do more than mix up the available
gasses a bit.  The huge pressures would have the effect of dampening the
explosion in the first place so all you would be doing with a relatively
small explosion is roiling things up.

But I think Bruce is talking about a *big* explosion (big big big!) like
that found in a Fission or, better yet, Fusion reaction.

In this case we have not only the heat and light energy of the explosion
itself, but the energy of all those excited particles running around.  I do
not think you could "induce fusion" simply by setting off a big bomb (it
would have to be a bomb so big...just fuggedaboutit! not to mention adding
mass to the GG to effectively make it into a star).  You could, however,
cause a "flare" of large proportions which emits a lot of radiation as the
fusion level spikes locally (local in a gas giant is a lot of territory)
and throws particles every which way.

Effects?  Perhaps the region of the GG would be bathed in all sorts of
radiation, frying electronics and essentially jamming any transmissions
except line-of-sight maser or laser and making sensor tasks harder.  Any
installations in orbit around the GG could be in serious trouble, depending
on all sorts of factors.  Moons of the GG may be temporarily warmed up
(from 50 Kelvin to 65 Kelvin maybe), but the long term effects would be nil.



>It would take a _really_ big, hardened warhead, but wow what you could do.
>That would allow you to terraform _systems_ Even if it didn\'t light up

Perhaps the better answer would be an array of solar or fusion powered
particle beam satellites of low, but constant, intensity in a frequency
which resonates with the plasma of the gas giant\'s surface.  Over time
(decades) the increase in heat would become measurable, the atmosphere of
the GG would slowly expand from the added pressure, fusion in the core may
occur in a low-key fashion, and one or two of the innermost satellites
might even heat up to, say, 100K (-275 F).

Hmm, in fact the fusion satellites would get their energy from the gas
giant\'s hydrogen atmosphere itself, converting it into energy.  But why do
it this way (assuming your goal is terraforming the GG\'s moons)?  Most of
the created energy just radiates out into space, when you just want to heat
up one planet, right?  Why not build an orbital platform which beams some
form of energy directly at the planet in question, fueled by the Hydrogen
from the gas giant?

You would need to heat up the planets surface (which ideally would be
mostly water ice) using the full spectrum of energy...from RF to light to
microwave.  Assume a very large reflective dish with a primary emitter
array giving off a large variety of rays that you do not want to fly your
vessel through (It would be a bit like getting close to a star).  Perhaps a
virtual consellation of satellites would be needed to get the right amount
and mixture of radiation on target.

This would begin melting the ice into water, then vapor which would become
the atmosphere of the planet.  Something would have to be done to prevent
the atmosphere from leeching out into space, which is a complicated balance
here on Earth.  You have the magnetosphere keeping the ionosphere in place,
which holds the rest of the atmosphere in place along with the gravity of
the earth (which would be insufficient all by itself).

If the moon in question did not have a molten core rotating inside the
crust (which, planetary theory says, acts like a big alternator, causing
the magnetic fields around the planet) the ionized outer atmosphere would
leech into space, causing a loss of atmosphere (this does happen actually,
but very slowly, and it\'s offset by other factors, so they say).

Moving the emitter\'s primary location up and down near the equator would
melt the oceans, but allow much of the water and other chamicals to remain
locked into polar icecaps.  The size of the icecaps would depend on whether
there was sufficient land to poke up above the level of your new oceans and
how deep you wanted the oceans.

Once a large amount of the water was liberated into atmospheric gasses, and
the ocean levels were set, the rays from the satellites would be partially
blocked by the gas mixture, leaving mostly visible light energy to reach
the surface.  Before this point you would probably need to heat the whole
surface of theplanet (except the poles).  After this point the atmosphere
would be better at retaining the heat from the "dayside".

If there is sufficient reflective material on the surface (land more than
water) then the heat from the light energy that gets through will reflect
back up to the atmosphere, which, in a well known greenhouse effect, will
reflect it back.  This is what we want, a level of greenhouse that
stabilizes the temperature at a balmy 90F or so at the equator (depending,
again, on the ice caps, usable land, etc).  The emitters can be replaced
with mostly visible/UV/IR light emitters (perhaps could be that all
along...but I\'d think the extra energy would helpin the beginning) and the
colonists can begin moving in.

Ok, I\'m simplifying vastly here.  But it could happen!

Jupiter is not big enough, by a decent margin, to sustain such
a reaction.  Wether you could get a bigger reaction if you could
somehow get a warhead down there, I don\'t know.  Though I\'m not
sure what one would be intending to blow up...

Except couriers don\'t go from every world to every other world within
jump-4 range at one time. Since a Jump-4 takes as long as a Jump-1,
you could easily stay ahead of your records for quite a long time
before even the first report got to every world within a reasonable

If there\'s a patrol there at all.

Since we\'re talking about "low traffic" worlds, though, these systems
would be serviced by smaller ships anyway. Not enough profit margins
for larger merchant ships, so there would be more, not less small
independently owned merchants at these worlds.

With all due respect Scott, if you are going tell me that I have to
accept your position on the numbers because it is canon, then you need
to abide by the restrictions canon makes with regard to
permanently-based system defense.

If the planet does not have the Tech Level _AND_ Population OR a
Navy/Scout base, then the planet cannot support a system defense.  An
SDB is, by definition, not jump capable, and would _not_ be in place in
this type of system.

The 100 diameter limit for Earth is 800,000 miles, which is 1.3 million km.
1.3 is a few.

I disagree. We only need asteroids maybe 10 times the size of the ship
(I should so simulations to qunatify this), particularly if you 
clamp to it and shuit everything down and/or just continuously
maneuver to keep the asteroid between you and the planet.

There is certainly not an exhaustive survey of 100-m-dimaeter asteroids
that pass within a few million km of earth. Based on the discovery rate
of ~few km earth-crossers and the general ratio of big to small I would

belts.

They\'d certainly all be known. They wouldn\'t be continously tracked
due to the "threat it poses to the planet" - it\'s not like asteroids are
likely to suddenly change course; you track it once, determine its orbit, and
then ignore it for a few million years.

If you\'re worried about pirates, then you do aim your sensors at
the hex with the asteroid in it (there are rules for this in the DSR), but
I wa thinking in the context of a system that could only afford maybe one
orbital sensor array, with a bored and under-skilled operator...he\'d check
out each asteroid maybe once a day; and even specific-hex checking out
only gets you +1 in sensitivity, which is more than offset by the landed
bonus to stealth.

My take on this is that it _does_ vary from planet to planet, as
follows:

If the planet is capable of maintaining jump-capable ships, its
jurisdiction encompasses the entire metasystem (which is
identical to the entire system in a single-star or
close/planetary multi-star system, and includes the planets and
primary of far companions).

If the planet is capable of manufacturing and supporting SDBs,
its jurisdiction is the entire system.  This does not include the
planets or primary of far companions, unless at least one colony
has been established by the planet in the far companion system.

If the planet is capable of COACC (i.e., can launch satellites
and maintain an air force), its jurisdiction is to the jump
limit, although the Imperial governor will generally defer to the
planetary government on non-critical issues outside the jump
limit but within the system.

If the planet is incapable of COACC (i.e., cannot field and
maintain an atmospheric military force - manned balloons count),
jurisdiction extends to the limits of military projection, though
it is strongly recommended that the Imperial governor defer to
the planetary government in all but the most critical matters
with respect to atmospheric control.

There are some exceptions to the "defaults" above; for example,
the planetary government always has the right of first
exploitation of all bodies in the system, and may license those
rights for royalties or other concessions to outside entities -
or not, as the case may be - and the Imperium is bound to enforce
or assist in the enforcement of those rights and concessions,
even if the planetary government is not capable of enforcement or
exploitation.

In most cases, probably a distinction that makes no difference -
it would make sense for the starport to recruit locally if the
local educational and technological standards were up to it.  By
far, the majority of the personnel manning the starport should be
locals, with foreigners perhaps being used in certain critical
areas requiring intimate knowledge of tech not within the
capabilities of the planet.  Administrators should, as a matter
of policy, be locals to the greatest extent possible.

"Linked" means that they are linked with the computer.  Such system pass
partial control to the vehicle\'s computer.  A modern example would be the
F-16C Fighting Falcon, which interprets the movement of the control stick
and decides how to best achieve the maneuver.

"Dynamic" are re configurable controls.  The desktop used by most O/S on
today\'s computers are a primitive version of this.  On a dynamic control
panel, I could set the colors, change the bias to account for my
left-handiness, prioritize certain readouts, etc..

Holographic controls are like dynamic, but work with 3-D "virtual" controls
and heads-up displays.

"Synaptic" systems actually learn the oddities of a particular operator,
and allows the system to anticipate what the operator will want.  This can
be as simple as bringing up the proper panel before the operator can
request it, or instigating evasive maneuvers before the pilot could
possibly react.

This is paraphrased from FFS2, pg 71.

Still not much. You\'d get an extra burst in the initial explosion - kind
of like if you had surrounded your warhead with extra deuterium/tritium/
whatever - but it wouldn\'t be sustained. The metallic hydrogen is
going to convect or conduct away the heat too quickly - the whole core
would warm up slightly rather than any spot getting hot enough to sustain
fusion. You\'re just way, way too far way in temperature and pressure
from stellar conditions. 

(For example, 70-jupiter-mass brown dwarfs actually have a fair amount
of fusion happening early in their life, but in the end cool down too much
to sustain it - a 1-jupiter-mass object is so low-mass that even if you
could ignite the *whole* core it would cool down very rapidly (although
that "very" might be by astronomical standards - a few thousand years), but
anyway the core is too big to ignite.

A lot of this is in the DSR. I may have come across too strongly about 
the chance of detection...certainly if all sorts of circumstances combine
you can become very hard to detect.

>We are eliminating a large chunk of adventuring here.

That certainly wasn\'t my intention - my intention was to give quantitative
rules for sensor performance and for all the tricks that could be performed.
As I said, it turned out that ships were surprisingly easy to detect - but
ref\'s aren\'t *obliged* to accept that; if you want a poor-sensor campaign
then you can still use the rules, just knock a point or so off all the
sensor sensitivity. 

But even if you use the rules as printed, there are lots of tricks PCs
can use, and if you spend enough money you can indeed make a very stealthy
ship, and if you know where the opposing sensors are located you can
use agressive baffling, and if the opposing sensors are in orbit you can
time your arrival to use their blind spots, and if they\'re on the ground
you can also use blind spots, and you can hitch a ride with an
asteroid or comet, or you can look for a system with heavy dust.
There are rules for it all...

it\'s a good suggestion - and that\'s essentially what advanced and
extreme masking in FFS2 do.

Take a look at FFS2, the errata, and the DSR; if you enjoy this sort of
sensor-and-masking stuff you might like them quite a bit - and if you want
ECM to be better or sensors to be worse that\'s easy to adjust.

	FWIW, I have personally observed a local sheriff in hot pursuit, sirens
howling, blow right past the armed sentry at the gate of an Air Force base,
which is a federal reservation ... basically an extrality line. Now, I
don\'t know if there were existing agreements, he called ahead, whatever.
But he sure surprised the poor airman who thought he\'d be safe if he ducked
on base.

As the example of Tarkine in District 268 tells us, the Imperium have (or
at least assume) authority over any world that supports piracy and is too
weak to defend itself against the Imperium.

However, I am not cliaming that any pirate who was able to regularily
capture merchants wouldn\'t be able to buy all the clandestine support he
needs. What I question is his ability to do so (and his motive, given
that he already owns a multi-million credit ship).

Sure, no question about that.

Send a squadron or fleet and replace the local government.

Contrary to what you may think, I agree with you one hundred percent. 
I\'ve said several times that I use pirates and lonely unpatrolled
systems myself. All I\'m saying is that I would be much more comfortable
with it if I didn\'t have to suspend my disbelief so damn much. If, for
example, the ratio of high-population worlds to other worlds were a lot
smaller, if high-population worlds didn\'t have naval budgets directly
proportional to their population, and if civilian ships were a lot less
expensive than military ships than they are at the moment. 

>Even when I have sensors placed, I have allowed for jamming/spoofing from
>military sensor suites, 

The trouble with jamming is that it is like flashing a big strong light in
the direction of the guy you\'re trying to jam. It tells him that you are
there and gives him a nice target to aim for. He may not know just who you
are, but that\'s not much of a comfort if he can just check your body
afterwards ;-)

>stealth technology to avoid detection, and
>gathered intelligence to determine weak spots in the sensor grids.

Sure, it would be much better for gaming potential if ships could hide in
empty space. Come up with a stealth field and get it approved by Marc and
I will give you a sitting ovation (you wouldn\'t be able to see me stand
anyway ;-) But you\'ll just have to realize that you would need to introduce
some physics nullifier to do so (My own suggestion, if you recall the
discussion some months ago, was a heat sink into another dimension that was
only accessible in deep space (and thus couldn\'t mess things up down inside
a gravity well). If you make the dingus really expensive you get the added
bonus of making military ships more expensive than civilian ships).

Don\'t know.

The Old Earth Union was peacefully absorbed by the Imperium in 588. The
Solomani Sphere was originally an autonomous region of the Imperium that
was created in 704 and was left to its own devices (with the very odd
exception of the Psionic Suppression manipulations) until the Solomani
Confederation was established in 871. From 871 to 950 the Solomani thought
of themselves as independent while the Imperium didn\'t think about them
much. In 950 the Imperium abolished the Solomani Autonomous Region and
tried to reintegrate the territory into the mainstream Imperium. Since the
Solomani had thought the Region abolished 80 years earlier they resented
that.

As for cargo, I don\'t think a ship registry file would bother with that.
The crew would be listed in the ship\'s log (propably difficult, but not
impossible, to tamper with). But the name of the captain could easily
be included in the ship registry. You don\'t change captains the way you
change your shirt.

On the well-travelled routes the information goes by X-boat and will
arrive in advance of the ship. In backwater systems the information
goes by naval couriers, by passing patrols and by relief ships. That\'s
where a ship may sometimes outrun its information.

I never said a pirate couldn\'t escape by jumping away. On the contrary,
I have several times said that any reasonably competent captain can
lower the odds of getting caught after jumping into a system considerably,
no matter how well patrolled. What he can\'t do is get close to a patrol
ship and get away unscathed. And I claim that in order to catch a
merchant, he will have to get close to a patrol ship, assuming that
the navy have as many ships as their budget implies and that they have
as few places to guard as the rules about jump travel implies.

1) A ship that dosen\'t appear on the ship registration file is suspicious.
2) A ship that dosen\'t have the captain that the SRF lists is suspicious.
3) A ship with high G rating, heavy armament, and no legitimate business
   in the system is suspicious.
4) A ship that arrives at the jump limit and hangs around there is VERY
   suspicious.
5) A ship that tries to get within shooting range of another ship is VERY,
   VERY suspicious.
6) A ship with high G rating, heavy armament, and no legitimate business
   in the system that arrives at the jump limit and hangs around there 
   and then tries to get within shooting range of another ship is VERY,
   VERY, VERY suspicious... ;-)

Since piracy is specifically prohibited by article IV of the Warrant of
Restoration, the document that founded the Third Imperium, and Sylea has
nuked starports it merely *suspected* of harboring pirates, I would think
it extremely unlikely.

What a timely suggestion. Just last weekend my players and I were
discussing how grav compensators worked. In my campaign, grav compensators
are what provide artificial gravity inside a ship as well as counteracting
the ship\'s acceleration.

The 3 Gs of a TL 12 grav compensator can only counteract 2 Gs while
providing a 1 G artificial gravity. In my campaign the thrust axis of most
ships are perpendicular to the ship decks (90 degrees to what is usually
show in Traveller deck plans, in Star Trek, and in ocean-going ships). This
is necessary so that ships can accelerate safely at 1 G above the
compensated acceleration, as shown in SSDS. The 1 G left over is what holds
them down. Ships that have decks parallel to the thrust axis can only
accelerate up to their G compensation, and when they do that the inside of
the ship is at zero G! Comments?

The reason this came up in my campaign is that the players asked if the
compensator could affect things outside the ship\'s hull. Specifically, they
wanted to tug a derelict ship by "grabbing" it with the G compensator. I
said no, that the compensator can\'t penetrate the ship\'s hull, but couldn\'t
give a good reason why it is able to penetrate things like bulkheads, cargo
containers, or battle dress. Can anybody help me out?

Some other ideas we kicked around without resolving involve how
controllable grav-compensators are. Can you have different compensation in
different areas of the ship? I would assume so since the old toroidal lab
ship had artificial gravity even if not rotating. If this is the case, why
couldn\'t you arrange it so people could walk around on the ceiling as well
as the floor and thereby double the floor space? Why not manipulate it so
cargo just \'falls\' in and out of the hold instead of needing cranes or
loaders? You could set them to fractional Gs to avoid damage.

One rule that was in BL/TNE that we should probably resurrect is that
unless the ship was designed to power the laser at ROF 100 - which usually
means military ships - you need a Gunnery or Engineering roll to avoid
overheating an ROF10 laser at ROF100. So it\'s possible if the Harrier\'s
opressors are a civilian ship that it can "only" fire 1 shot / 3 minutes...
which is still bad news.

Another thing to note is that - T4\'s combat rules to the contrary - pounding a
ship with laser fire is not goint to make it mystically run out of hitpoints
and explode; it\'ll just be increasingly full of small holes, with more
systems out and maybe some crew casualties, but it won\'t explode.

Well, from my view, one of the best things about the 2300 system was the
background.  I like the idea of nations in space, esp since it allowed a
little nationalism to enter into the plots.  The character gen system was a
step in the right direction, (Traveller:2300 was the "grandfather" of the GDW
House system, which was refined after that into 2300AD, then Twilight:2000,
then Dark Conspiracy, then TNE)  The down side of it was the fact that there
were gaping holes in the rules, the starship combat and design system weren\'t
very good (although MUCH less intensive than FFS) and the background kinda
limited the game a bit (Humanity had explored what it could, but the
stutterwarp drive had a 7.7ly range...and at a certain point you couldn\'t go
anywhere else because of that.)

2300AD was a great system for playing the Aliens or cyberpunk-style
campaigns...I think it\'s a shame it never got the treatment that Twilight or
TNE got.  On the other hand, nothing can beat out CT for it\'s overall system!

If my PCs are like most people in the Imperium then they\'d need to track
ALL asteroids lest people mount T-plates on them and make big holes in the
ground wehere their enemies used to live.

My players actually contemplated hurling a relativistic bowlingball into a
hospital-asteroid to kill off a criminal kingpin that had insulted them (OK
maybe he tortured them a bit as well), never mind the thousands of patients
resident at the hospital.

I talked them out of it...

Just a note. It\'ll have to be one *massive* planet to have even a small
planet in its Trojan point. Even Jupiter can\'t manage anything more
than small to medium asteroids there. Anything much bigger is too big
to fit the "conditions".

The moon\'s trojan points essentially have coarse *dust*.

The short answer is nothing. But it would achieve very little other than
the destruction of the ship.

Somebody went into this in an Analog article some years back. The
pressure just isn\'t there. You need pressures *way* above degeneracy
levels to get fusion to work. So "mere" metallic hydrogen pressures are
nothing.

Doesn\'t matter. According to the principle of relativity, you can just
as easily consider the missile to be motionless and the planet to be
rushing towards it at great speed. The results *must* be the same.

Now if it\'s a *small* piece of matter rushing towards the missile,
things get messier.

So? That just means that the Kzinti won\'t *win* the war. There\'s no way
that they\'ll let plant-eaters conquer them. So it\'ll be a long,
drawn-out stalemate. And as we know, the Kzinti *do* learn patience if
you hit them over the head long enough.

There have been several sorts of tables for misjumps over the years.
They *can* take longer (or shorter!), but as I recall that was most
often a case where the "misjump" *was* the wacky duration.

But I tend to agree with a post Marc Miller made a month or so back.
They\'ll know it\'s a misjump as soon as they make the entrance into
jumpspace. So they get to spend the week (or whatever) *worrying* about
where they\'ll come out.

Jumpspace is not supposed to be all that good to look at. It doesn\'t
automatically drive you nuts, but it sure doesn\'t help you stay sane.
And most folks agree that anything that gets much beyond the hull while
in jumpspace (more than a few meters) will be precipitated out of
jumpspace one subatomic particle at a time more or less along the
ship\'s path. 

The "few meters" means that you *can* actually do things like repair
battle damage while in jump. Or sneak out an airlock at one end of the
ship to sneak in through another so as to get "behind" someone. It\'s
just risky, and requires *real* steady nerves. Think of it as being
like crawling around on the bottom of an 18-wheeler as it goes
barreling down the freeway. You can do it, but you\'d be very aware of
what happens if you move too far away.

There are lots of different opinions on this. There is a concensus that
there\'s *some* sort of "glow" or even a sort of "light show" effect as
the ship enters or leaves jump. And since you have this mass that
wasn\'t there a second ago, any kind of mass detector or gravity sensor
will notice a "pulse" as the ship appears.

I assume that the folks onboard feel *something*. And that it\'s "worse"
for a misjump.

The Aslan didn\'t do much until the Long Night however, when they began
serious expansion. It was their good luck that there were no human 
empires of any size present, as the Aslan have trouble cooperating in 
large numbers and generally lag Imperial/Solomani tech.

There was a *big* discussion about this last year. I don\'t want to
rehash it again. Suffice it to say you are right, but there are *some*
advantages to putting the decks the way most Traveller plans and ST
have.

The most elegant handwave I\'ve seen kicked around is that grav
compensation and artificial gravity is a "field effect". That is, it
only affects the area between the floor and the ceiling. The floor acts
as one "pole", and the ceiling the other. If one or the other isn\'t
operating you get nada.

That\'s why it doesn\'t penetrate the hull, but everything else between
the floor and ceiling is affected.

The handwave above neatly solves the problem of people walking on the
ceiling and the floor. It\'s a field effect (like magnetism) and one pole
is "up" and the other "down". You can reverse the polarity and have
people walking on the ceiling, but never floor and ceiling at the same
time.

If it did work that way, imagine the poor saps who decide to jump in the
air. Falling in two directions sounds like a recipe for torn ligaments
or ... worse. :)

I handwave compensation as being provided by a mechanism different from
artificial gravity. Compensation can only do just that: compensate for
inertial forces. Cancel \'em. You can\'t create a new force to "push" the
container out the door. You can only cancel (to a limit) G\'s pulled in
the lateral/vertical direction.

You can have different gravity fields on different areas of the ship,
just by varying the strength of the grav "plates".

Hmm. Here\'s a question then. If a hit by a laser holes a section with
atmosphere and a lhyd tank, won\'t the two mix and combust (assuming the
laser also provides a spark)? Of course, millitary vessels would probably
be depressurized before seeing combat and the crew wearing vacc suits.
Given the timescale involed, so too civilian ships, I suppose.

A minor rant...

I know a little of psychology (and you know what they say about a little
knowledge). Still, I have a very hard time with the concept of the mere
sight of jumpspace being a variable affecting "sanity." It smacks of
psuedoscience to me, a result of a poor understanding of paychology. What
exactly would the mechanism be that would be a factor in mental
dysfunction? Stress? This is really the only thing I can think of -- and if
that is the case, then I have a hard time with the argument that looking at
jumpspace is any more destructive than looking at any other really
disturbing phenomena.

Thoughts on the matter would be appreciated. To me, this just smacks too
much of the quasi-Lovecraftian, psychodynamic (and even mystical) ideas of
how the human brain works.

Just to take a real life example. Some days ago, a fishingship was boarded
outside the coast of Australia for illegal fishing. The owners are thought
to be some norwegains but that is not certain. This illustrates how
difficult it can be to know the owners of ships. As for the captain, I
know that large tankers change captains every second or third week. It
might very well be that this is true for ships of the Imperium. I think
that the Imperium is likely to not be really interested in who the captain
is as long as he can produce some legimate papers.

But info reaching the next jump-1 system is going to take on week, the
same as for the X-boat, so they\'ll reach there before the info. Reaching
the highport would take hours and then your off to the next port. Now the
info has had a chance to reach this port before the pirate, and I admite
that he now has to be clever. What he could do is make the ship appaered
to have been sold in the previous system, an exchange perhaps, with the
crew being replaced. Just on of the top of my head example.

All he has to do is be closest to the ship he wants to attack. He
brodcasts a mayday signal, and since the merchant he is wants has to come 
to the rescue (the laws of the high sea applied) he just waits until it is
real close. Then he broadcasts a thight beam message that the turrets of
his ship is locked onto the victim and that he just act naturally. He then
starts the docking procedure, gets his cargo (there is no way in hell that
a SDB is going to fire at two ships 15m apart at a distance of several
thousand km. As the last of the cargo is brought aboard the ships jump
engine is fired up, and while maintaining the closeness to the victim you
just jump out of there.

Another way to get to your victim is to insure that you are the closest
ship to it, send a thight beam message that unless he sends out a mayday
signal and act in trouble he\'ll be blasted out of the sky. Then as the
mayday signal is broadcast sped to his "rescue" and continue with the
scenario above. It just ain\'t that hard if you have some brains.

  Of course, but any pirate with respect for himself will have several

  Why? Say my captain falls ill and is replaced by another company captain
  at some port. Why is this suspicous? You can\'t stop freighters and
  merchant so that they loose good money because one name is wrong. The
  captain is just an employee of the owners and can be fired, replaced,
  fall ill, die, get heartsick, get a promotion, be drafted, quit and
  there is no way that the Imperium can or is interested in keeping this
  info up to date, in all and every sytem. If the ship is stopped for
  customs searches and the captain has some papers he\'ll be accepted.

  This is not how I see the Imperium, where nobles, megacorporations, rich
  fellows all travel in the thousands to and from worlds continously. Is a
  merchant doing trips outside the imperium suspicous just because he is
  armed. And I think that large amount of the travel in the Imperium will
  be incidents were there to the burecrates of the starport appears to be
  no legitimate busniess, else than just passing through on my way to
  somewhere else.

  Of course, but no one is going to do that, execpt the USL traders that
  jump in, have their cargo unloaded, new cargo loaded, fuel refilled and
  jump on. Out by the jump limit magacorps will have depots to cut down on
  time. Cargo is shipped out to the jump limit before the ship appears,
  and cargo is shipped to the world after the ship has jumped. And from
  time to time, a corporate yacht will use the same depot, and the SDB
  don\'t want to shot it down just because it hanged out at the jump limit.
  The jump limit will IMHO be a very croweded place.

  Since shooting range is 30.000km for short range thsi is just
  ridicoulus. All ship going towards a world will be in the same hex or
  adjenct hexes and therefor within firering range.

See as above.

The more and more I think about it, I really don\'t see the Imperium as a
big brother that has killed piracy. Even with 100 SDB in one crowded
system there will be oppertunities.

Fair enough.  _I_ would have designed things such that an SDB could be
maintained on site, but then, I would have designed things such that it
would be needed, and insufficient to stop all piracy, even around mid sized
worlds.  I think this makes for a more exciting game, and the jump drive
just works too close to planets for my taste.  I would be happier if jump
drive started where thrusters stopped, making the entire solar system an
interesting place.

I think my earlier point still stands, even if I cannot have cheap SDBs in
systems where they would just rust.  The weaponry and armor that makes a
warship usable are very cheap compared to the cost of the rest of the ship,
so it does not take many losses before it is worth having protection.

Again, BOTE, I figured that when a 4Kt merchant and a 4KT warship cost
within 10% to a factor of 2 of each other, rather than different by several
orders of magnitude as on Earth now, it takes very few losses to make a
loss worth preventing.  As best as I can tell, the line is going to be
somewhere between one prevented loss of a ship one tenth the cost, and one
prevented loss of a ship equal in cost to the proposed warship.

Whether this comes via convoy, or via escort, or via SDB is not as
important as the economic truth that insurance of some kind will exist, and
that it will try to prevent crushing losses.  There will be people who go
outside the protection of the convoys, Navy, bases, whatever, but if the
risk is high, and the return low, it will not happen often.

Further, given that the "cost of the umbrella" is low compared to the cost
of the vessels that might get lost, it is going to be very, very important
for a world to put in some kind of suppression system if they want any
traffic at all, and important for the Imperial reputation.  I figured that
was what those fighters proposed by Cleon were for - low grade pirate
suppression.

Yes, okay, so life\'s descended upon me in a huge pile of something which,

CORPS sounds pretty interesting, but one important question.  Is point based
chargen the _only_ form of chargen?  I\'m not a big fan of point based
character generation (in real life, people\'s advantages are very rarely
balanced evenly with their disadvantages.  Some people get lucky, and some
people don\'t).

Depends on the definition of IT. The ship, yes. The planet, no.
A ship jumping on planet would have a rather good chance of vanishing into
J-space forever and being destroyed by the reality therein. 

I define the effect of gravity as compressing J-space, and instead of a
bubble you would get an ellipsoid resulting in part of the ship being
outside the J-drive protection. The ship would be torn to pieces. The people
on the planety would see the ship glow blue, then stretch and then vanish.
The problem would occur in a very tny pocket of J-space. 

This is why J-drive is based on volume, because it has to make a correct
bubble size. The bubble is typically one-two meters bigger than the ship in
all dimensions. If you put a scout J-2 into a Free Trader, it would take a
few hours of changing the volume parameters. In other words a 100 ton J2 is
not a 200 ton J1 without some modifiers. Basically, you would have to tell
the J2 100 ton to reduce the dimensionality by 50% (I needed a  word for how
deep into J-space you go by J#) and increase volume by 100%.

I used to know a girl who was epileptic, and couldn\'t go to movies because
the high speed flicker caused her to have seizures.  I\'ve also kept track
of "face" sightings, which shows the human mind\'s ability to pull familiar
patterns out of random things.

It has been shown that certain sights can have a direct influence on the
mind, and the disturbing aspects of j-space is just an aspect of that.
Personally I see the j-space effect as being similar to a bad LSD trip..
There\'s nothing really there to look at, so your mind begins putting things
in for you...

I would think the field generators would be mounted in the floor (the
ones to create the 1G of artificial gravity) or they would have
projectors mounted there (more likely and less \'overhead\' of
equipment). So if they wanted to rip up the decking to get the grav
compensators out, rewire them for power and control and mount them
someplace to point them at the derelict they could do that.

We play that you can.  In fact to while away time in jump space on
trip one of our guys designed a voice activated control module to

Might work until the containers reach the grav field of the planet or

Fabricate a lightweight, collapsible framework that fits over the aft
half of the ship.

Stretch black mylar, or some other material, over the framework - to
provide for optical camoflage.

Attach piping (or allow for flow in \'pockets\' in the material) to the
fuel supply, and allow a flow of LHyd through the material.

In case of emergency, the framework can be jettisoned, and direction of
thrust will take you away from the LHyd-filled piping.  The material
should be sensor-transparent, or allow deployment of the passive array.

What do you think?  I\'d like to throw this at the party (tho\' more from
a stumbling across a MilInt operation than from a pirate encounter) next
game, so I\'d appreciate feedback.

I\'ve actually always assumed \'Interior Explosion\' to be caused by a
number of different factors.  The pressure tanks themselves, keeping
enough atmosphere to re-air the ship 1.5 times (I only allow reduced
pressure if they explosively decompress) - well if you\'ve ever seen a
oxygen bottle propel itself through a bulkhead, you would have a great
deal of respect for the amount of energy compressed gasses have.  Mixing
Lhyd and O2, boom.  Mixing exotic gases (required for M-drive and
J-drive operation), boom.  Hits on the hi-power network (ever seen a
transformer go in a rainstorm?), boom.  Hits on ordinance (especially
those nasty demolition kits), boom.  Hits in the paint locker, boom.

There are a lot of combustible materials aboard a ship!

So far as  catastrophic destruction of the ship, well - that\'s got to be
the fuel tanks letting loose (unfortunate mixing of the Hi-pressure O2
and LHyd systems), of (if you have a missile launcher) a magazine
explosion.

There is a great scene in a movie about the Berlin Airlift (the title slips
my mind, but it starred Montgomery Clift and Paul Douglas). American airman
and his newly found German Girlfriend are slumming in Berlin, during which
time the poor schlub loses his uniform and military ID, and finds himself in
the Soviet secto, dressed in borrowed civies and without papersr. As he and
the woman try to sneak back into the American sector, they are nabbed in the
middle of a large open square by the Soviet MP. They scream for help to the
American MP, who comes over and is joined by the British MP. The Russians
claim the couple is in the Russian sector, but the Yank says the line is over
there, and the couple is in _his_ jurisdction. Both sides appeal to the Brit,
who says that the whitewashed line on the sidewalk is worn away. An argument
ensues, and draws a crowd who proceed to join in the dabate (No, I remember
clearly, it was straight out from the streetlight over there!"). As the
argument between MPs over who has jurisdiction gets more and more heated, the
Airman and his ladyfriend back slowly away, blend into the crowd and move
away, unnoticed.

I never found a situation where I could work that into Traveller. Wonderful
scene, though.

Incidentaly, when I wrote the Champa Starport article for JTAS, I took the
word "Extrality" from one of historian Barbara Tuchman\'s books, who says it
was originally used to describe the situation in the Trade Ports in China
during the period 1890-1930. It seemed a useful term to hijack for SF use.

The way I play it is that the laws of physics are fundamentally different,
such that jumpspace is anathema to our spacetime, our matter, and so on.
Normally, you are in a nice, safe jump bubble which keeps it far enough
away that edge effects are not important.  When you gaze at it through a
view screen, it is merely disturbing, like an Escher print writ large - the
things which are happening in it are fundamentally not possible in a
universe we know, and only marginally possible at an interface.

This, per se, does not drive people batty, but it is a tremendous stressor.
 Any Psi talents often hurt, because you may well get false signals from
the boundary.  Add the fact that your mind works no better than anything
else native to this set of fundamental laws, and you are really in dire
straits if you are "right up against it."

A Physics prof I know used to tell stories about a chap at one of the big
accelerators, who was prized because he would fix them with the fields on.
His comment was "It feels really weird when you turn your head."  Given the
magnetic fields in there, I cannot be surprised.  I assumed close proximity
to it was part of the problem, and why pictures of it do not prepare you well.

Or, given the height of most starship decks, you\'ll a) be smacking into

I have visualized jumpspace as black ... very black ... this would of course
not help anyone to stay sane, but it would not be a problem either (unless
you where afraid of the dark :-)

I was wondering if there is any canon description of how jumpspace looks ...
can someone answer that question for me?

I\'ve never (IMTU) seen jump failures as causing much *outside* damage at
all.  A ship jumping from a planet\'s surface might cause some collateral
damage -- e.g., pulling a hunk of the ground and random pieces of nearby
equipment into jumpspace with it, and perhaps releasing a brief, mild
burst of high-energy radiation -- but mostly it\'d just misjump wildly with
massive damage to the drive (tiny chance) or flat-out disappear forever,
presumably scattered as component quarks across a 72-parsec-diameter
sphere.

Well... some of we heretics subscribe to the notion that jumpspace is
also the carrier medium through which psionic powers propogate. If one
allows psionics in a campaign, then a little jumpspace dementia doesn\'t
hurt.

Maybe people see their own grisly deaths ... or the end of the universe,
of all time. Maybe the brain is overloaded with sensory input, or the
complete incoherence of that input causes certain areas to shut down.
Perhaps a hypnotic effect is at work ... once you look, you can\'t tear
yourself away; look too long -- and that\'s all you\'ll *ever* see.
<shudder> Now *that\'s* disturbing. I think our experience of disturbing
phenomena is quite narrow, and you might be premature in thinking that
jumpspace can\'t be more destructive than the most disturbing phenomena
we know.

I empathize with your statement. But jumpspace *is* a mysterious,
mystical place.

the Commander decided to produce a 1 shot plasma pistol.  The result is the 
"Noisy Cricket" Plasma Pistol, so named that during its first test firing, 
the gunman was thrown back several meters due to the awesome recoil of this

    I agree wholeheartedly. It takes a lot to make any sort of impression
on a Gas Giant. They are so big. It is flat impossible to "ignite" a gas
giant and create any sort of long-term fusion. A fusion reaction is mainly
driven by pressure, not heat or any such. Unless you significantly add to a
Giant\'s Mass it just won\'t light.
    However, scale can work to your advantage too.  Some sort of
catestrophic impact might set some sort of reaction going on a temporary
basis. And temporary for a Gas Giant can be measured in centuries.
    Say you did your accelerate_your_planetoid_at_1G for a few months, but
not at the giant, but one of its less commercially viable moons. If you can
whack it soft enough not to fragment it, but hard enough to change its
momentumn significantly you might get it to spiral in. (Repeat as
necessary.) Now something the size of a galelian moon might cause the giant
to sputter for a while.
    In a Bughunters game I ran recently there was a cold-ish gas giant,
mainly metallic hydrogen, in close orbit around a pithy M-class star. There
was a ring like structure made up mainly of conductive metal that some
handwaving aliens used to manipulate the magnetic field of the gas giant,
and consequently the star itself to create a solar flare. The solar flare,
in turn, threw enough ions into the whole system which the gas giant
focused like a lens and rather smashed apart a battle fleet. The magnetised
remains settled in harmonic points forming the previously mentioned metalic
ring material.

    No matter how bizzare, anything that seems to have any plausability
whatsoever turns out to be far more expensive than covering the planet with
domes and giving all the citizens warm mittens. Occum\'s razor wins in the
end.



>You would need to heat up the planets surface
An idea a saw a long time ago was about seting up satelites that would
unfold into huge arrays of micro-thin reflective material. This would
reflect daylight onto major US cities. The costing said it was cheaper than
all those streetlights. Needless to say this was before the Environmental
Lobbiests had any power.


>If there is sufficient reflective material on the surface
Actually I forgot about albedo. The easiest, and probably cheapest, way to
heat a planet is probably to paint it black. (Wouldn\'t the Goths be happy?)
Image some sort of microbe that can live in minimal conditions, breeds like
bejaysus until saturated, and carries a black pigment. Saves hours of
brushwork.
It would be a bit drab, but warmer.


Actually, in 2010 they ignite Jupiter via magic replciating black boxes.
Clarke usually has his science pretty accurate (unless he is waving a magic
wand like the star drive in Rendezvous with Rama). Anyone read the book?

The pirate encounters in CT, as least I don\'t have MT in

If piracy wasn\'t so common, why should the Imperium allow any civilian ship
to mount weapons? Whenever you buy or have a ship built for you, you may
*always* get "civilian grade" weapons and defense systems, no question asked.

This means that the Imperium admits that Piracy is always possible. If this
was not the case, nobody could have weapons/armor/sandcaster on his ship.

What equipment is required to enter and maintain Jump Space?

Weird, right?  I know a jump-drive is needed (duh) :)

Look at it like this.

I am sitting still, I prepare and enter jumpspace.  Now, does the jump drive need to 
remain functional during the entire jump?  Or is it only used to get you into jumpspace 
and once there, the whole ship could turn off power, including the jump drive?  IOW, it 
makes the jump-tunnel and then you enter it and that is all there is to it...

Or, does the jump drive get you into jumpspace and need to be functioning to maintain the 
jump?

The reason I am asking is I\'d like to know what equipment is vital during the move through 
jumpspace.  What could be turned off for repair during the week-long jump?  What could 
randomly \'fail\' that would keep them in jump?  What if the jump-drive failed, would they 
fall from jumpspace?  Die?  Be \'Lost-in-Space\' (Danger Will Robinson).

I hope I am making this clear.  Am I?

I dearly hope its an "anti-material" missile.  I\'ll look tonight.  A Helo

Point-based is the only way to go, but there\'s nothing to say that you
can\'t have unbalanced characters.  I regularly have players with far too
many points in disads who insist that each and every point is needed for
the character concept.  On the other hand, the player who gave me his
20-page background story got 500 SP to spend.  He made himself a retired
Admiral with contacts *everywhere* and an encyclopedic knowledge of local
space.

It\'d have to be extremely black - charge them the Military Ultrablack cost
(about MCr 1 pe rm2, I think) and calculate the signature based on the surface
area of the black stuff. 

I think, in th eend, something like this won\'t buy you anything. It\'ll
still be getting heat input from sunlight and also from any radiators on
the ship that face the black thing, so you\'d have to cool it pretty
agressively - it\'s probably easier just to shut down the facing radiators and
cool the hull, which is what Advanced and Extreme Masking in FFS2 do.

(In fact, my intent with Extreme Masking and Military Ultrablack was that
they be so expensive that they mostly get used for spy ships like this.)

There\'s probably nowhere near enough O2 onboard to make a ship explode.
Still, I don\'t mind one "ship explodes" critical hit on the critical hit

Very hard, because the sensors are very high-resolution - you\'d have to
be right on top of the star (within a fraction of an arcsecond) to
Not Be Seen; if the opponent was accelerating at all it would be very
hard to maintian this situation.

The one exception is thelocal sun, of course - coming from the same
direction as the local sun (with in 15 degrees) gets you a big bonus
to signature. It\'s possible I could add an even bigger bonus for being 
within 1 degree of the sun, though that\'s hard to do on a hexgrid it might
be useful to do in roleplaying situations (maybe an extra -1 to passive
and -0.5 to active for being *right* in front of the sun, which is only 
allowed for non-maneuvering sensors.)

This happens to me regularly. I have accepted it as a fact.

Can it have something to do with the way the posts are sent through the net?
Perhaps they travel along different routes or something ...
Does anyone know why this happens?

Yes, yes, but if he isn\'t the captain they expect then he will have those
papers inspected more thoroughly than if he is. Just like you can expect
to be more thoroghly questioned if you aren\'t the owner of the car you\'re
driving when a cop pulls you over.

You appear to think that I\'m talking about a ship that was captured in the
first system and jumps to another. I would never expect a pirate to be that
stupid. If he does manage to capture a ship he\'ll jump to some secret
hideaway and try to disguise it. What I\'m talking about is that if you
plan to do something blatantly illegal in the next system, you don\'t jump
in with your own transponder broadcasting, because you don\'t wan\'t to be
identified, now do you? So you have to use a fake transponder signal. And
that has to be either a legitimate ship that is in the database or a
completely unknown identity. In either case it is not something you
want to use more than once and it is not something you\'d want anyone
to check even once. Which means you have to behave with exquisite
normalcy while you are in the system.

The nearest patrol vessel will of course start to move towards him too.
Indeed, if the 3G acceleration of the patrol ship will allow it to reach
him before the 1G of the merchant, then the merchant will not even have
to respond at all. And how did he get that close to the merchant in the
first place? If pirates are such a big threat then traffic patterns will
be enforced. Besides, he dosen\'t know what he will find when he arrives
at one of these small systems. There may not be any victim at all. Even
if he is aiming for a scheduled ship, jump uncertainty can put him 48
hours away from him.

>he just waits until it is real close. Then he broadcasts a tight beam

There\'s no way he can be sure that the victim isn\'t using a tight beam of
his own to talk to the patrol ship, but that dosen\'t really matter,
because the patrol ship is on its way anyway. More seriously, he\'d better
be sure his victim isn\'t equipped with weapons of its own, since if it
is, it will have its turrets manned and be looking for the first bit of
suspicious behavior as a signal to blaze away. Finally, he can\'t be sure
that the victim won\'t decide to make a run for it anyway, forcing him to
jump off with empty pockets.

You keep forgetting that a pirate ship is an expensive investment that
has to make you a return. If you have to keep jumping back and forth
between marginal systems for months before hitting on the ideal piracy
situation, then you are apt to lose your ship to the recievers before
you make your first capture.

The jump from inside the 100 diameter limit is the least of the hazards,
true enough.

I agree that if you have brains and no one else has any then it is easy.

Any merchant has to spend a few hours in port while he unloads and loads.
That will give you an opportunity to check him out.

And if the new captain has the proper papers and the ship\'s identifying
marks check out then there is no problem.

Sure, and then the authorities have enough information about the ship to
identify it again. Go ahead and plunder a ship on the way out, if you like.
Did you talk about brains?

Not if he has some legitimate business. But if a ship has a high G rating
and heavy armaments, then the number of places where it can make a living
is severely limited.

Au contraire. A starship is an expensive thing. A single mid passage will
cost Joe Average most of a year\'s income. The number of people who can 
to jump somewhere just for the heck of it is not large. Most ships will
have a reason to be where they are. The rest will get extra attention from
the authorities.

If they arrived at exactly the same time, yes. The odds against that
happening in a system with a few hundred ships per year traffic are
literally astronomical. And any ship that sits on the ground for days
without doing anything and then "just happening" to decide to leave
right after another has blasted off will be asked to wait while the
authorities goes through their papers one more time. You seem to assume
that only the pirates will have any brain. I just don\'t see it that
way. More the other way around, if anything.

Does this mean that you would see strange moving THINGS just outside your
field of vision, half-visible staring faces in the murky darkness etc. ?

Sounds like a really bad experience. If you are going to get out there and
repair something, you\'d better keep your eyes on what you\'re doing.
Otherwise, you might get scared and lose your grip ...

I imagine there must be tales told among starship crew ... stories about
horrible monsters dwelling in jumpspace, and at very rare times attacking
ships through some defect in the protective bubble.

Modern science denies all such rumours as paranoid fantasies, of course ...=

merchant tonnage in Aramis Subsector:


"The Traveller Adventure" gives enough information about trading companies to
make some educated guesses about the total size of the trade fleet. It should
be noted, however, that a number of assumptions that may not be true at all
are necessary. Don\'t take the following for more than it\'s worth.

TUKERA LINES: Provides scheduled services along X-boat routes. Has major
offices at Aramis and Junidy and minor on Towers, Nasemin, Natoko, L\'oeul
d\'Dieu, and Dhian.

Assumption: Tukera has about one 1000 T long-liner per office + several
3,000 T freighters operating in Aramis for a total of perhaps 20,000 T.

AKERUT LINES: Runs feeder routes throughout the sub-sector. Has approx.
50 5,000 T freighters. 25% of shipping is outside subsector for a total of
187,500 T.

IMPERIALLINES: Facilities on Violante, Pysadi, Reacher, Patinir, Dhian,
Carsten, Feneteman, Yebab, and Jesedispere. Supposedly each facility has 2
2,000 T freighters assigned (Not quite true, but that must appear reasonable
to outsiders). That would be a total of 18,000 T.

OBERLINDES: Are "roughly parallel to Akerut", another 187,500 T.

AL MORAI: 1 1000 T liner to L\'oeul d\'Dieu and another to Aramis: 2,000 T.

OUTSIDERS: Just as 25% of Akerut (and presumably Oberlindes) shipping goes
outside Aramis, outsiders would constitute some of the traffic in Aramis.
I\'m going to assume it amounts to about the same, or 125,000 T.

Total for the large shipping lines: 540,000 T

Assumption: The small fledgeling lines and the free traders account for about
the same or another 540,000 T (A shaky assumption, I admit).

Total: 1,080,000 T of shipping in Aramis Subsector.

The total population of Aramis Subsector is about 33 billion (not 111 billion
as is claimed in _Spinward Marches_). That would make the merchant fleet about
1 T per 30,000 citizens, which I consider far too little, but there it is.
Perhaps Aramis is truly a backwater when it comes to trade.

You are clearly designing weapons using some kind of rules system ... from

The problem with this is that your senses can only deal with certain
stimuli. Any other data is pretty much ignored, or just turned into random
noise (press on your eyes while they are closed to see what I mean. You
will see "stars," or some other type of random light pattern if you press
hard enough. This is because the receptors of the retina are interpreting
the pressure the only way they can).

The proximity I could understand -- there is a possible physical mechanism
there. But I highly doubt that just *seeing* jumpspace would have any
effect.

Like when you are laying awake at night, at the edge of sleep in a dark
room, staring at that shirt draped over the chair, and it begins to move
and says "How\'ya doing?"
:)

However, there is no reason to believe that this effect is any greater than
seeing things in any random stimuli. I may be incorrect in this, but it
seems to me that some of the Traveller stuff insinuates that *just looking*
at the phenomena is enough to cause dysfunction, whether or not there is a
pre-existing condition (like your aquaintance who has epilepsy).

Unlike LSD, which has a physiological effect, looking at jump space is just
that -- looking. If what was seen was a phenomena "not natural to this
universe," it would not cause a mental disorder just because one saw it.
Rather, it would just look meaningless.

Now, actually having *proximity* to a jumpspace boundary, where there might
be a physiological effect -- I can see this as causing possible illness.

Umm. Where does the heat go?

I mean, if you use LHyd to cool whatever is radiating heat, that LHyd gains
heat. To cool the LHyd again, you would have to generate more heat (because
to cool the LHyd you would have to do work on it), and so on, ad infinitum.

Isn\'t that the problem with IR masking? The laws of thermodynamics?

Somewhere you are going to have to radiate the heat. Am I right,
physics-guys? :)

AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPERIAL NAVY IN THE CLASSIC ERA
===================================================

Main sources: _Fighting Ships_, _Spinward Marches Campaign_ and _Rebellion_.

NUMBER AND TYPE OF SHIPS

_Rebellion_ p. 27 states that each sector of the Imperium theoretically has a
group of fleets numbering about 1000 ships. This number includes combat vessels
such as cruisers, carriers, battleships, and _some_ escorts (emphasis mine).
It does not include auxiliaries, support ships, and scouts.

The first ambiguity lies in just what kind of escorts are included in the 1000
ship figure and what kind are not. Are the 5,000 T _Sloan_ class escorts so
big that they are counted, or is there a class of escorts smaller than a
light cruiser (30,000 T ships), but bigger than Sloans?

Perhaps one should postulate an escort class of around 10-20,000 T, big enough
to mount a spinal weapon, but too light to be classed as even a light cruiser.
A bit inelegant, especially since FS states that escorts are ships of up to 
5000 T and that the presence of a spinal mount is what distinguishes a
cruiser, but OTOH, are there really no ships in the 5,000-20,000 T range?
And this way we can define \'combat vessels\' as ships with spinal mounts and
auxiliaries as ships without. 

Perhaps the simplest solution is to ignore the \',and some escorts\' part and
still consider the presence of a spinal mount the criteria for being part of
the figure.

The second ambiguity is whether battleriders are included in the figure or
not. I would have preferred that they were not, but the one detailed squadron
I know of (the 154th Battle Rider Squadron described in SMC) clearly implies
that they are.
 
In the following for ease of reference I\'m going to use the word \'armada\'
about the sector fleets and reserve the word \'fleet\' for the sub-sector-sized
fleets that the armadas are composed of. Also \'combat vessels\' for the ships
included in the 1000 ship figure and \'auxiliaries\' for all the ships that
isn\'t.

If the 1000 ships are for a sector with a full sixteen sub-sectors, then the
average fleet has 1000/16 = 62.5 ships. Since there are 320 regular fleets in
the Imperium, the total of combat ships for the Imperium would be around
20,000.

Further down it is stated that a regular fleet has between 2 and 10 squadrons
amounting to a total of between 50 and 200 ships. This would appear to average
out to 125 ships per fleet with an average of 6 squadrons per fleet and 21
ships per squadron.

Possibly this means that the squadrons are combat vessels _plus_ escorts and 
that the 125 ship figure includes auxiliaries. This would give us a navy of
20,000 combat vessels and a like number of auxiliaries.

However, FS states that CruRons are generally of 4 to 8 ships and the examples
in it implies that 8 ship BatRons are the norm. (Also, I seem to remember
squadrons of non-combat vessels mentioned somewhere, but I can\'t recall the
references).

Possibly the 2-squadron fleets and 25-ship squadrons are rare and almost all
fleets have 8-10 squadrons with almost all squadrons running to between 8 and
20 ships (half combat vessels and half escorts). With an average of about 9
squadrons per fleet and 14 ships per squadron we\'ll get about 20,000 combat
vessels and the same number of escorts. This still leave the pure auxiliary
squadrons like tanker squadrons and patrol squadrons (PatRons ;-) unaccounted
for, but it\'s a start.

SIZE AND COST OF A SQUADRON

The 154th Battle Squadron detailed in SMC consists of:

  1 300,000 T _Lurenti_ Class Carrier @ MCr23,056         =  23,056
  7 20,000 T _Nolikian_ Class Battle Riders @ MCr9,268.25 =  64,878
200 50 T _Sylean_ Class Heavy Fighters @ MCr105.33        =  21,066
  7 5,000 T _Sloan_ Class Escorts @ MCr3,334.5            =  23,342 
  
A total of MCr132,342 of which MCr109,000 goes to the combat vessels and the
remaining 17.6% goes to the escorts.

Obviously this must be one of the cheapest squadrons in the navy. If all the
20,000 combat ships cost around MCr19,000 (including the cost of its pendant
auxiliary) then the total cost of the regular Imperial navy would be TCr380.
This would represent 15% of the Imperium\'s total military investment, which
would make the whole shebang cost TCr2,533. Annual maintenance would run to
TCr254. Divided by the 15 trillion inhabitants of the Imperium that would be
Cr17 per man.

If we assume that the ships in FS constitutes a representative sample, then
we see that the average cruiser/carrier is of 52,714 T and costs MCr31,193.
If we reduce that to 50,000 T and add the cost of a 5,000 T escort apiece,
the average cruiser works out at roughly MCr33,000. The three battleships
average 300,000 T and costs MCr206,106 apiece, which with the escort and a
little rounding comes to MCr210,000.

Unfortunately, that just isn\'t enough. Even if we assume that ALL the combat
ships are battleships, it still only amounts to a total cost of TCr4,200,
which works out at a military budget of Cr187 per inhabitant of the Imperium.
If we assume a ratio of battleships to cruisers similar to the one in FS
(3:7), the the cost falls to TCr1723, or Cr77 per inhabitant.

Of course, we might say that we still haven\'t accounted for most of the
auxiliary ships yet. We\'ve included one 5,000 T escort for each combat ship,
but what about the couriers, destroyers, smaller escorts, transports and
tankers that appear in FS and elsewhere? For example, I happen to believe that
a navy would have a massive number of couriers, say 20 per fleet, but even
6400 couriers only amount to another 1.6 TCr. The same would apply to
destroyers and the like -- you need a huge number of them to affect the budget
noticeably. Some of the other auxiliaries like tankers would cost more
individually -- the milion T _Gorodish_ class fleet tenders mentioned in FS
might run to MCr400,000 apiece, but how many of those are the average fleet
likely to have? One? Two? OK, that\'s another 256 TCr, which is a help, but it
still leaves a long way to go. Remember that every credit we increase the
budget with represents another 3000 destroyers (just to pick an example), and
we know from the recent pirate debate that the Imperium apparently lack the
small ships to police all its member worlds adequately. So we may push the
budget up to Cr85/man by use of the smaller fry, but not much more than that.

There are two more possibilities that I can see. One is that battleriders are
NOT, after all, included in the 1000 ship figure. If a carrier and half a
dozen dreadnaught-sized battleriders counted as one ship instead of 6, then
we could get some really expensive ships. Unfortunately battleriders tend to
be cruiser-sized. The carrier needed to carry 6 200,000 T battleriders would
have to be about 2-2.5 million tons and the maximum size of a ship in CT is
1 million. A 1 million T carrier would only amount to about twice the cost
of the average battleship (MCr430) and according to FS the 500,000 T
_Tigress_ class dreadnaught is the largest ship in the Spinward Marches. A
500,000 T carrier would cost about the same as an average dreadnaught, which
leaves us back where we started.

The other possibility is that a large number of ships are laid up in
ordinary. That would require that part of the annual budget was used to
maintain these inactive ships, which would make the active part of the navy
a correspondingly smaller share. If we assume that the wartime budget of the
Imperium is 1.5 times the peacetime budget (a guesstimate based on the
various government multipliers in TCS) and that there would be enough ships
in ordinary to operate on the wartime budget, then there would be about one
ship in ordinary for each two active ships and about 6% of the budget would
be spent on maintaning them. If instead we assume that peacetime spending is
the 3% of GNP that _Striker_ gives and wartime spending would be 15% of GNP
then the Imperium could have EIGHT ships in ordinary for each active ship and
spend 45% of its peacetime budget on maintaining them. That would push the
military spending up to about Cr150/citizen. Whether you like the idea of an
Imperial reserve fleet of 160,000 combat vessels is another matter. (There is
some small support for the notion in the fact that acording to _Arrival
Vengeance_ ships are still being reactivated in 1123, six years after the
beginning of the Rebellion, with at least two more years to go before they
are finished. OTOH it requires an implausibly long view to maintain reserves
that will take 8 years to activate...)

And in the end, even with the best will in the world it appears that the 
Imperial navy is only about half the size that it should be (Cr150 would be
1.5% of the GNP and we were calculating with 3%).

To those who would suggest that perhaps the Imperium feels so secure that it
is using even less than the standard 3% peacetime spending I\'d like to point
to the Solomani, Zhodani, and K\'Kree and suggest that it is rather implausible
that the Imperium would feel so secure.

I\'d like to finish off by re-emphasizing that all those ships, the 20,000 
combat vessels, the 20,000 big escorts and the unspecified number of lesser
ships only represent 15% of the Cr150. Another 15% goes to the subsector
fleets and the remaining 70% goes to planetary defenses, though admittedly
6-40% of that (4.2-28% of the total) would go to armies.

My own suggestion is to halve the contribution that population 9 worlds CAN
make to the military budget and halve it again for pop 10 worlds (and then
after the fact come up with whatever handwaving you need to accept that). If
the high-population worlds can\'t manage as much as the rest, then the high-
pop worlds of the Imperium\'s neighbors can\'t either, so the Imperium won\'t
need to be paranoid about spending less money than they.

What do you think?

This may be true, but there is a great potential for fires in various parts
of the ship. And fires within a contained area (such as a spaceship) can be
quite deadly unless you are using some kind of breathing apparatus.

>There\'s probably nowhere near enough O2 onboard to make a ship explode.

OK, to set this issue straight, you will need to relax. Sit down in a
comfortable chair, close your eyes and take a deep breath ...   :-)

In school, we turned a small metal can upside-down, added some hydrogen ...
instant ear-popper ! And we used only the oxygen in the normal air we=

Yes, I agree with this one. A ship won\'t explode if it is fired upon
multiple times with each hit doing only minor damage. Instead it would
probably get de-pressurized, electronics would get destroyed, crew would die
etc.

What would be left would be a dead husk ...

No, your understanding is wrong.  If you jump from inside a gravity
well, you increase your chances of misjump, but that\'s all.  Nothing bad
happens to the planet, except for a small disturbance as the atmosphere
rushes in to the place where your ship was.

Maybe there\'s a small energy discharge, too.  Someone needs to look at
Starship Operators\' Manual (or I will when I get home).

You are RIGHT!  Because anti-piracy work is the function of the Navy,
and they have destroyed it (so say the
build-ships-til-you-can-walk-to-the-mooners) - the mere fact you would
_want_ weapons on your ship indicates a nefarious purpose.

Let\'s have turret buy back days!  Trade missiles for mittens!  Lasers
for liberty!  Plasma Guns for *hey - where did you get THAT!*

The heck with bothering with ship registration, if they have a turret,
pull \'em over!  Hell, if they have a turret, they\'re probably guilty,
blast \'em!!

And while we are at it, 1 G is good enough for civilian ships.  Anything
more and you are probably plotting on overtaking someone.  SLOW DOWN
those hopped up ships!

Let\'s institute mandatory downloading of your ship\'s log when you jump
into a system.  This way, no smuggling, swearing, or gambling can occur
while in Jump Space.  Properly instituted, the logs will be a record of
everything that occurs on the ship (interfaced with the now-obsolete
Anti-Hijack program, there will be a fairly complete record of
everything that occurs on the ship, as well as complete IDs on the crew
and passengers.)  These logs won\'t fill up much of the infinite memory
mandated for Navy ships (the complete Imperial ship\'s registration, crew
qualification, and hot sheet), and hell, sailors are bored because they
don\'t have lives (being permanently stationed over some podunk
spaceport, on never-ending anti-piracy patrols that are for show anyway
- - there are no pirates left) - they can go over them to be sure
everything is on the up and up.

Actually tho, when you think about all those Patrol Cruisers and SDBs
that are built and put into service for a/piracy work, and all the crews
that man them - it makes more sense to just skip building the ships and
put a Naval representative on each ship that is released into commercial
service.  This permanently installed representative of the Empire can
ensure that the ship is only used for legal purposes; that the captain
always pays his ship\'s payment; that the engineer never swears; and that
the steward always helps little old ladies across the street.

	I don\'t know. However, I help run another mailing list on the net that
has nearly 800 people on it. I think Traveller has around 300, I\'m not sure.

	We used to use the Majordomo software on our list, the one that TML
uses now, but since myself and three friends took it over, we opted for the
Listserv software instead.

	When we had Majordomo to serve the list, messages then also took around
six hours to get back.

	Now, Listserv sends messages out to every subscriber within a few seconds
of it being sent. Yes, you aren\'t seeing things. I can send a message to
our list and I can get it back between ten seconds and a minute, and so can
everyone else on the list.

	The only people who seem to ocassionally have problems are AOL
subscribers, but I think it\'s something to do with the list being hosted by
AOL and the way they prioritise messages. They do it for free by the way,
under some \'give the net back to the people\' policy.

	Anyway, sorry for being off-subject, and for not mailing the list
administrator directly (we dislike that on our list too!) but I didn\'t know
who to contact.

	See ya...

Actually, you do not go outside the skin of the ship during Jump.  The
bubble only extends a meter, more or less, from the skin of the ship. 
The more isn\'t so bad, the less is fatal, and very unpredictable.  (Just
a side note, I had a player running a scientist who got a lab ship as a
muster out benefit.  I let him keep it with the understanding that he
had it on permanent loan from the university, and that he had two other
professors and thier grad students along.  One of the profs was a
J-space physist with a specially wired vacc suit he kept trying to
convince people would interface with the ship\'s J-field and protect them
from J-space...I never did talk one of the PCs into trying it out \'for
the advancement of knowledge\'!)

Incorrect, as JMS and multiple cast members have explained -- I think most
of the backstory should be available on the Lurker\'s Guide.  Claudia
wanted to _be_ in 18 episodes, but to _be_paid_ for 22, whether she
appeared in them or not.  That would violate the other actors\' contracts,
and was unacceptable.  JMS was willing to limit her to 18 episodes (at
standard pay) or take her for the full 22.  It was Ms. Christian\'s sole
and entire decision to leave the show, and her subsequent distortions and
misrepresentations have certainly blackened her name in my view.

Kinda strange, indeed.  Because it isn\'t true.

Yes, the points system is the only form of character generation (in the
main book). I tend to like it, since it means no character is going to be
more powerful than the others without some form of limitations. However, I
realise that some people don\'t like that form of generation.

I guess if you wanted to add some randomness to character generation, but
without changing much else, one way to do it would be to have players role
for how many points they get to generate their character with. For a
"realistic" campaign, CORPS assumes that characters start with 100
Attribute Points and 50 Skill Points (of course, the GM can change this).
So, perhaps players could start with something like 80 + 6d6 AP, and 40 +
4d6 SP (just off the top of my head).

If you want to get away totally from points generation then you could, but
you would have a lot more work to do. But the result could probably still
be slotted into the CORPS system without too much effort.

Something else to bear in mind is that all players wont start of with the
same number of points any way, since age modifies the starting points.

Cheers,
Jason

This is a real stalemate (and hence a good role-playing opportunity). 
The bad guys find that they can\'t successfully board the good guys\'
ship; indeed, they\'ve been driven off. The good guys can\'t get away, and
can\'t disable or destroy the bad guys (or the whole boarding thing
wouldn\'t have happened).  The bad guys can just go away, but the prize
is too tasty to leave behind.  

Players and referee can be on either side in this scenario.  What can be
done?

Bad guys can threaten to blow good guys away if they don\'t give up. 
This is a bluff, maybe.  Maybe the bad guys really need a new ship, or
really need the cash from selling a captured ship.  Maybe they don\'t;
maybe they just don\'t want any witnesses to be rescued by the
authorities.  That\'s the only motivation that I can think of to respond
to the question posed above.  

Bad guys can starve the good guys -- just hang with them, don\'t let them
move the ship to safety or replenishment, and wait until life support or
food gives out.  If the good guys\' ship\'s atmospheric integrity has been
breached, how long can they stand to live in their vacc suits?  Of
course, the good guys might have years\' of supplies aboard.  Location is
a big factor here -- if someone can respond to a distress signal
("Mayday ... mayday ... Free Trader Beowulf ... scrzzxxx"), the bad guys
can\'t wait too long.

Bad guys can get creative.  Maybe they try boarding from a new
direction, or multiple boarding parties (nature of good guys\' ship and
bad guys\' crew are the big factors).  Maybe they try misdirection, like
sending a false signal (from another ship, or from their own after
appearing to have given up); or opening communications and lying in some
convincing and useful way ("Capt. Kouros, we\'ve got your mother here. 
Maybe you\'d like to speak with her.  Of course we know her maiden name. 
It\'s, it\'s, it\'s .... Blearrgch!").  

Bad guys can use a manpower advantage, or can appear to do so.  Bad guys
keep making boarding attempts on the good guys\' ship, but then don\'t
consummate.  Good guys have to keep responding -- because they don\'t
which attack is real -- so they don\'t get any sleep.  Bad guys either
have a bigger crew (unlikely, given the scenario) or are mostly resting
while a skeleton crew pilots in and out and fakes the attacks.

(1)  What\'s wrong with quasi-Lovecraftian psychodynamic mystical ideas? 
What are the Hivers but the Elder Gods?  Who is Grandfather but Him Who
Must Not Be Named?  It wasn\'t that long ago that this very list had a
long exploration of the Cthulhu Mythos in Traveller.  That exploration
nearly drove Doug (or was it Craig?) Berry mad.  (Footnote: The idea
that looking at jump space makes you crazy is explored in some detail by
Larry Niven in his early works.  I don\'t recall a hard science
explanation there, however.)

(2)   Towards a hard science explanation:  Let\'s start with the nature
of vision.  Vision is the interaction among some kind of radiation,
photoreceptor cells in the eyes, the optic nerve, the part of the brain
that processes signals from the optic nerve, and the cerebral cortex.  

What kind of radiation emanates from jump space?  It may not be entirely
within our familiar spectrum of visible light; it may not even be
electromagnetic radiation, but I\'ll leave further exploration of that
issue to the physicists and other scientists among us.

The radiation hits the photoreceptor cells in the eyes, causing an
electrochemical reaction (or not, depending on the radiation; if it\'s
outside the visual spectrum, that means that it doesn\'t stimulate the
photoreceptor cells to send signals down the optic nerve that the
cerebral cortex eventually translates as vision).  The electrochemical
reaction causes an electrical signal to travel from the synapse between
the photoreceptor cell and the first nerve down the first nerve to the
synapse between the first and second nerve, where a second
electrochemical reaction occurs, and so on to the optic nerve and then
to and through the neural pathways in the brain.  

Which chemicals (called neurotransmitters) are involved in the
electrochemical reactions depends on what light -- that is, what energy
wavelength -- is stimulating the photoreceptors (and my physiological
psychology textbook is in storage, so I can\'t identify the chemicals). 
The cerebral cortex then interprets these electrical signals as light or
dark, and what color.  

So what may happen when this unidentified radiation from jump space
stimulates the photoreceptors?  It may cause the nerves in the optic
nerve system to send signals to the nerves in the brain that cause those
nerves to produce or activate inappropriate neurotransmitters, leading
to all sorts of problems (at the referee\'s discretion, I suppose).  

Some examples of neurotransmitter problems that I remember (or maybe
misremember) from my physiological psychology class are the following:  

Some forms of schizophrenia are caused by inadequate production of
dopamine.  If there is inadequate dopamine at the dopamine receptor
sites, one\'s threshhold for perception drops to a maladaptive level --
you start literally hearing things, things that you otherwise would have
tuned out, like the people talking in the next room.  

LSD either replaces serotonin at the receptor sites in the brain\'s dream
center, or causes prodction of serotonin while one is awake (I\'ve
forgotten which).  The result is vivid wakeful dreams, i.e.,
hallucinations.  I think that naturally occuring hallucinogens -- like
peyote -- do the same thing.  

Opiates replace endorphins at the receptor sites in the brain\'s pleasure
center, and cause a much stronger electochemical reaction.  The
resulting euphoria is debilitating.

Canon has always insisted that, once you\'re in J-space, you\'re there for a
week, no exceptions (save misjumps, but you can\'t control those).  If one
could drop out of jump by turning something off, people would use it for
fast in-system microjumps...jump, wait an hour, turn something off, be
billions of km from where you started.

So, either (a) there is something you can turn off to drop out of J-space,
but it inevitably destroys the ship (a la a catastrophic misjump), or (b)
there is simply no off switch -- that is, you could melt down the J-drive
and you\'d still coast merrily on toward your orignal breakout place and
time.

> Or, does the jump drive get you into jumpspace and need to be
> functioning to maintain the jump? 

Well, my guess is this:  Maintaining the jump is free; however, without
continuing control from a functioning J-drive (requiring negligible power,
like a few kilowatts maximum), the shape of the "jump bubble" will tend to
slowly distort over time, possibly intersecting with the ship itself if
this goes on too long.  When that happens, parts of the ship may just
disappear, other parts become a bit \'warped\' (as if given a slight twist
through a higher dimension), and crew members will most definitely start
getting *massive* jump-sickness, complete with the psychological effects. 
If enough of the ship gets eaten or warped, or the crew get too badly
exposed, they\'ll die.

(Again, in my view...) All J-drives are designed so that the jump-entry
mechanisms can be powered down separately for in-jump maintenance, with
the jump-bubble-maintenance equipment continuing to operate on a separate
power supply and control system.  Also, since J-bubble distortion is slow,
hot-shot engineers have been known to take the maintenance system off-line
during jump, working on it for a few hours then bringing it back up before
the bubble can drift too far.  One can only imagine the fun which ensues
when such an engineer hits the ON button and nothing happens but a few
wisps of smoke drifting out of the ventillation slots...

That\'s pretty much how I do it too.  I use bulkheads for support and to
compartmentalize the ship into air-tight sections.  Some interior walls are
set in place, but some are movable partitions of light metal or laminates
of one kind or another (I don\'t use plain plastic for fire/fume reasons).

Absolutely!  If you want more safety (like on warships) you increase the
compartmentalizing, with the ultimate being each compartment is airtight
and protected from "blowouts."  For civilian ships, I don\'t go that far,
but for warships it\'s pretty close to the standard.

Right and fuel tankage can be in collapsible spaces that give more room
when you are carrying less fuel.  That might not be canon, but I use it.

I think 2 cm of steel (or better) would be overkill for any *major*
interior bulkhead.  I also place airlocks between major sections of a ship
(Engineering and Bridge certainly) to isolate and protect them from
depressurization and blowouts.  Half this thickness would work for other
bulkheads..actually, 2 or 3 mm of steel should do.  Ceilings (and floors)
are configured as bulkheads to reduce the chance of blowouts crossing
decks.  Partitions separating cabins and other spaces are more for privacy
and sound baffling as anything so they can be as thin or thick as you want.

When it comes to hulls, I use a double hulled approach (sometimes tripled
on warships).  The inner hull is thin-ish (1 to 2 cm).  The outer hull is
the "armor" and is as thick as as you desire.  Between the inner and outer
hull is a gap of about 1.5 meters where piping, wiring, AG/CG modules, and
other equipment is installed.  Maintenance and Technical staff spend a
*lot* of time in the "inter-hull" spaces.

Decks are a standard 3.5 meters with 2.5 between floor and overhead in
standard spaces.  Between overhead and floor are crawl spaces where control
and service conduits are placed and serviced.  In Engineering and Cargo
spaces decks are often double high (7 meters) with the overhead exposed for
easy access.

Just my way of doing things.

A fancy photon torpedo. I believe it\'s still a matter/anti-matter device
maybe with some sort of "black hole" (quantum singularity) tie in. Of
course, with ST there\'s a new field/particle/effect in every episode. ;->

>BTW: is it possible to accelerate a torpedo by using subspace? 

In Star Trek, a torpedo can travel at "warp" speeds, yes.  The torpedo
velocity is given as vi + (vi*0.75)/c, where vi is the initial velocity at
which the torpedo was launched (from the _ST-TNG Tech Manual_). The torpedo
doesn\'t have a warp drive, but it has a short range AM fuel cell and a set
of "sustainer coils" that "grap and hold a hand-off field from the launcher
tube.  Their effective tactical range is about 3.5 Mkm.

>And will it "hit" when it is in subspace??

In Star Trek, yes...well, sort of.  My understanding is that the ships
aren\'t really *in* subspace they just *use* subspace to travel faster than
light. It really is a matter of warping space thereby shortening the
distance traveled. Phasers, OTOH, are limited to c and aren\'t effective at
near and trans-light velocities.

I play/GM Star Trek games too. ;->

Consider that the sensors looking for the ship have a *lot* more
parallax to work with. It\'s hard to spoof sensors seperated by a few
hundred thousand km. At least by hiding in a signal source.

It\'s not just the aft end of the ship that needs masking. The living

Easiest is to use a "bubble" of something like mylar and "inflate" it
with a whisper of gas. Like the old Echo satellite (a 50 foot sphere of
mylar which packed into something the size of a shoebox, and was
"inflated" by the tiny amount of air trapped inside.

The LHyd *won\'t* help. Not for long anyway. It\'ll *quickly* get hotter.
And compared with the heat output of a ship, it only takes an hour or
two to use up alll the Lhyd you can carry. 

And worse, LHyd temp is the *wrong* temp to hide with. You either need
to be at 3K (cosmic background) or at the temp of a natural body at
that distance from the star (likely 200-300K). LHyd is 20k. That may
*sound* close to 3K, but it isn\'t. When measured in K, temp differences
are effectively *logarithmic*. So the differences between 3K and 30k
and 300K are about the same, thermodynamically speaking.  And 20K is
pretty close to 30k on that scale. (about 7 times as hot as 3k, and
1/15th as hot as 300k).

As I note above, you *can\'t* carry enough "cold" stuff to absorb your
heat output for a reasonable time. 

What you *can* do is spread your heat output over a larger area. But it
takes a *lot* of area. Still, it\'s doable for *large* bubbles and
*small* ships. Say a thousand meter bubble with a "recon" configuration
fighter in it. 

That, by the way is why pirates get nervous when snuggling up to
"natural" bodies as camoflage. There are stories of the pirate who was
just settling down to wait for a target when the crew of the covert
surveillance ship inside the fake asteroid knocked on the airlock and
took them prisoner.

  If a fundamental disagreement about naval budgets exist, perhaps
that should be returned to. As far as SDB\'s and patrol ships go, I
don\'t see that population is particularly relevant. The typical 400
Dt SDB from Supp:7 has ~10 crew, which expands to a still modest 100
total crew and support personnel even using the wildly pessimistic
x10 figure that (IIRC) applied to heavy bombers in WW II.

  Wouldn\'t the carrier/shipping company still be hosed from the moment
when the ship is "rerouted"? The cargo will be late, and you may not 
know for some time whether you\'ll ever see it again. As indicated by
others, the potential value of the ship renders hanging around a bit
too poor a cost-benefit option. 

  Again, as a possible scam, some scenarios emerge :)

  Neither would I, but my backers might have provided spares nearby.
More importantly, it\'s not "only" 22+%; that 22+ is removed from the
value under 100% that\'s already used on useless garbage like a bridge,
comp, staterooms, ship\'s boat (if any), power plant, M-drive, etc.
I tried to work some numbers through during a recent (boring) lecture
and determined that i) TL 12 power plants require _loads_ of cash, and
ii) my armour will be maxed out, and my pirate foe hasn\'t allocated
for _cargo_ yet.        (all assumes TL 12, HG rules)

  Under High Guard, unless you can get nukes or a USP 5 laser battery,
you can\'t really hurt that SDB, while it has no such difficulty.

I was assuming that they\'d head for home eventually. Also, since they\'d

Yes, but that "law" is *not* the law of any particular nation. It\'s

 Most areas where there are multiple Jurisdiction\'s the Law Enforcement agencies
involved will
have some sort of mutual support agreement. Including the right of passage while in
"Hot

Example: The agreement between CHP and the NHP states Seven miles of shared

  Hmm, I hate to say it, but this made for a really neat plot for one
of Brian Daley\'s "Han Solo" novels - obtain (faked) authorizations to
allow the Falcon to operate under the new performance envelope regs in
the Corporate Sector. They figured that anyone with a fast ship, lotsa
guns, a bit of cargo, and the sensors and firecon of a small warship
might be tempted to do something illegal with it.

The people that are reactivating ships start with the most suitable
ships for reactivation & work their way down to older ships of lesser
quality.  Ordinarily it would not take eight years for this process but
ordinarily there is not a Civil War going on.  Maybe the Naval personnel
responsible for reactivating ships were a bit busy fighting & repairing
dammage to newer, better, ships to devote much time to reactivating 175
year old TL 13 ships that were second line ships during the Third
Frontier War and have been in ordinary for 130 years or so...  Normally
the Naval personnel responsible for reactivating old ships would not be
doing anything else but the Rebellion was not normal circumstances.

  You\'re obviously not paranoid enough to be in charge. Now, _that_

  Definitely. I don\'t see how high pop must mean a proportionately
high industrialization rate, which seems to be the relevant value
for both shipbuilding capacity, and the metal-eaters portions of
the budget.

  I\'m trying to figure out how difficult piracy is/isn\'t, and under
what circumstances. I suggest there are situations where it will be
possible, and that allowing civilian vessels arms protects the small
traders from some of those situations, and can allow the larger ships
of the big corps to function as naval auxiliaries, at least inasmuch
as they become difficult targets for little 400 Dt commerce raiders.

They could have some US style sociological hangup.

Stemming back from the Imperiums formation in order to get more starsystems
joining the Imperium they were allowed to keep their merchants armed to
"supress piracy".

As the Imperium grew the need for this antipiracy thing went away but
whenever an Emperor tried to take away the merchants/shipowners "right to
bear arms" they reacted violently with a knee-jerk response about
big-brother behaviour, tyranny, individual freedom etc very similar to US
today. This could also explain why the Imperium seem to allow such
destructive weaponry without license - a thing albeit cool roleplayingwise
seem very unrealistic.

No such wavelength exists. And PA or Laser, you\'d be lucky to get 1% of

It\'s quite possible. A 1000 kilometer long mass driver running at 1
million g will accelerate an object to 1.5% of c. :-)

And the speed might not need to be that high.

Hydrogen and oxygen, like all gas mixtures have definite limits to
flammability. Exceed the limits (either too much or too little) and the
mix won\'t ignite. For example, for the *really* deep dives, a mixture
of hydrogen and oxygen is used as the breathing mixture. There\'s so
*little* oxygen in it that it won\'t ignite. 

Also, Lhyd is *cold*. That means it\'ll take a lot of energy to get the
mix up to ignition temp. In fact, the main result of spraying LHyd into
the air will be that the air liquifies! Or even *freezes*.

Ever try looking at a 4 dimensional object? I\'ve got a computer program
that will display it (in 3d if you have a pair of 3d glasses) and let
you rotate and translate it along all *four* axes. (1)

The point being that the brain models reality. When it encounters a
portion of reality that doesn\'t fit the model, it tries to make it fit.
If that doesn\'t work, *sometimes* (and I do mean *sometimes*) it\'ll
modify the model. 

Several psychological disorders are little more than operating with a
model that has a poor fit to reality ("They are all out to get me").
And some others are the result of an inability to update the model. 

Given that the laws of physics out side the jump bubble are *different*
and may involve extra dimensions, it\'s possible that you could see
things that your "model" can\'t accomodate. And not be *able* to come up
with a model that they fit. That will *not* be good for your sanity.
At the very least, it\'ll make folks uncomfortable ("It *can\'t* be doing
that..."). More "rigid" types could actually crack.

It\'s just a matter of adaptability. Some folks can\'t adapt to severe
changes in reality. And what you\'d see outside the bubble could count
as a "severe change"

(1) while I haven\'t played with it enough to say for certain, I am told
by semi-reliable sources that *some* people can learn to "visualize" in
4 dimensions. After playing with the 4d program for a while, they can
confidently *tell* you what will happen if you make various moves.

Actually, the forces are "different", at least in *direction*. So you
have 1 G "artificial gravity" holding you to the floor. That\'s in
*addition* to the 3 g of g-comp that keeps you from thinking the wall
is a floor. Since the vectors are different, you are ok (no more than 3
g in any given *direction*.

For the ship with the decks aligned perpendicular to the thrust axis
(like on the Broadsword Merc Cruiser), you can run at 4 G thrust, use 3
g of g-comp to neutral 3 g of it, and let the remaining 1 g hold you to
the floor.

Sure. The "problem" with generating "gravity" is that extended sources
behave in ways that aren\'t terribly useful. For example, the field from
a flat "plate" (like a deck) has *no* decrement. That is, aside from
"edge effects", if it attracts with one g at 1 meter, it\'ll do so at
infinity (of course to avoid the edge effects, it\'d have to be
infinitely wide :-). 

This causes unwanted problems. So the way they generate the field in
the ship is to have *paired* plates. The floor attracts with .5 g, the
ceiling pushes with .5 g. This helps reduce edge effects inside the
ship, but also tends to "confine" the field (think of the field between
opposing magnetic poles). The dipole field drops off *fast* outside the
plates. There is some residual field, but it just makes crawling around
on the hull "interesting".

Because that would require a plate in the middle doing the "repelling",
Otherwise tuning both floor and ceiling to "pull", would result in zero
g between them. Remember, the forces have to reach all the way to the
"ceiling". Otherwise your head would be in free fall. 

But it\'s generally assumed that you *can* adjust the gravity in your
stateroom. And hijackers dread the thought of the captain getting to
the controls for the grav plates (that corridor just became an elevator
shaft, with you at the top, and under 3g!).

> Why not manipulate it so

Because that requires a lot of *local* control over the field. The
plates aren\'t set up for such fine control. It\'d require using smaller
plates (more expensive for the same area covered) and a *lot* more
computer power.

BTW, the only real "handwave" in the above is the bit about *how*
rapidly the field drops off outside the ship. If I recall what I\'ve
been told correctly, dipole type fields drop off according to an
inverse cube law (when you aren\'t close to the source). I suspect that
there\'d still be a noticeable field for a ways outside the hull.

It\'s always been my understanding that trying to jump from a planet\'s
surface results in an *automatic* misjump. Probably the sort where all
they ever find is mangled fragments spread evenly over the sector.

Anything outside the jump field (ie, all but a few cubic yards of the
planet) is safe.

The the "suicide" jumper might take a "divot" out of the tarmac, but
that\'s about it.

	Kewl!  Uncle Hengie has put the design bureau back into detox for a
week as punishment for not having thought of it first :).

	Seriously, though, the recoil is scary.  I\'ve done a few full-auto
weapons where the recoil on full auto was 5.  The recoil on the .600 Nitro
Express revolver that I did back in September was 5.41.  .44 Automags (of
which I did several a little while back in an effort to really optimise a
design) tend to result in approximately 3.1-3.3 recoil.  I would think that
a recoil of 25 could be potentially fatal to the shooter.

	What all this does is beg the question of what exactly the recoil
numbers in FF&S mean.  What is the maximum recoil for a handgun?  A rifle?
How does recoil relate to strength?

Paolo, either there is another reason why the Imperium allows civilian
weapons (basic philosophy perhaps) or we have what is technically known as
a discrepancy. The interesting thing about two conflicting facts is that
if you take them in isolation it is imposible to say which one is true
and which one is false. All you can say is that IF Fact A is right then
Fact B is wrong. What you ignore is that IF Fact B is right the it is
Fact A that is wrong.

Right. And if everybody had weapons then a pirate would either have to be
sufficiently stronger than the norm that he would be instantly suspicious
or he would be able to pass for a merchant, but unable to outfight another
merchant.

Douglas, if you know how a 3G merchant ship can compete with a 1G ship of

Douglas, previously published material (PPM for short) says that the
Imperium requires you to broadcast your identity when you enter a system.
Think of it as shouting your licences plate number at every cop you pass
in your car. And I see nothing unreasonable in assuming that the transponder
shares some of the characteristics of a flight recorder and that the ship\'s
log is supposed to be difficult to tamper with. In fact, I believe that TNE
claims it is (of course, TNE also claims that the transponders are completely 
tamperproof, which is contrary to PPM).

>These logs won\'t fill up much of the infinite memory mandated for Navy ships

Let\'s see. Assume one T of merchant shipping per 1000 citizens in the
Imperium. That would be 15,000,000,000 T. Assume an average size of 400 T
for merchants. That would be 37,500,000. Assume an entry size of 10K for
a ship registration file. That would be 375,000 M, or 750 times more than
my PC can handle. Yeah, I guess a TL 15 computer would be unable to handle
that (See, I can babble with the best).

This works perfectly well as a guiding principle if it\'s a PC ship,

It\'s not the 3G acceleration, it\'s the vector the ship\'s building... 
but if it\'s not on a direct approach for the starport or other 
sensible destination, damned right.  And come in at high v if you 
want to find out how well armed the local military are.

In my Traveller universe, this happens routinely in major systems.  
Dump your flight plan or accept System Control\'s route (which will 
invariably lose you priority).

If we weren\'t going so heavily for irony here, it could be pointed 
out that a ship\'s _operational_ records (sensor logs, comm logs) 
might be required, the ship\'s manifest would be required (crew, 
passengers, cargo) but personal and medical logs would be absolutely 
confidential.

One of the reasons Europeans put up with bureaucracy is because 
despite all its manifest stupidities it is considerably better than 
major armed conflicts.  It is boring, restrictive and safe.  I for 
one am happier to be caught on security cameras than by muggers.  The 
Vilani-influenced Third Imperium would s(h)urely prefer 
over-controlled space travel to the cost of being pirated.

And it\'s cheaper than an SDB to run, probably ;-)

Actually I think the SDBs are cheaper.  Wonder how many covert INI 
agents work as starship crew?

"I caught him sniffing around in the cargo hold, Captain Shigu."
"What is the meaning of this, Anderson?"
"I\'m an INI operative, Captain.  It\'s my jo... hey, where are you

Hmmmm.  I *like* this idea.  Thanks, Douglas.

To enger jumpspace, you need a jump drive, a hull grid of the appropriate
volume, a power plant, and a lot of liquid hydrogen.

To maintain jumpspace, nothing.  You stay in jumpspace for about a week.
BUT, without additional equipment, the fragile bubble of reality that contains
the ship will soon collapse, and reduce the ship to component quarks (which
will then stay in jumpspace for the rest of the week, and probably emerge
evenly distributed over a 36-parsec sphere - kind of hard to put back together).

To survive in jumpspace, you need a jump drive, a hull grid of the
appropriate volume, and a power plant.  Without the continous operation of
the jump drive (which energizes the hull grid and maintains the "jump
bubble" around the ship), you die in a catastrophic misjump.

> So, either (a) there is something you can turn off to drop out of J-space,
> but it inevitably destroys the ship (a la a catastrophic misjump)

I lean towards option (a).  It means that you can\'t monkey with the power or
the jump drive during jump (which is good), and it means that there\'s
something for the engineering staff to do (other than maintenance).

IMHO, the engineering staff watches over the jump drive and power plant (so
that they operate smoothly and continously for a week) while in jump space.
They can use this time to perform maintenance on the maneuver drives,
weapons, and just about any other interior system except for life support.

When the ship is in normal space, they can maintain the jump drive.  When
the ship is docked and hooked up to starport power and life-support, then
they can work on the life-support and power plant systems.

Unlike certain other members of the crew (like the navigator and pilot, who
basically have the week off during jump), the engineering staff has something
to do all the time.

It\'s pretty well-established that you need a significant amount of time
(preferably several days to a week) to do maintainance and recalibration of
the jump drive after you exit jump before you can jump again.  Even jumping
\'immediately\' means taking an hour or so for the most basic cross-checks.

I\'d suggest this indicates that the jump drive and power plant can\'t be
taken offline for maintenance while in jumpspace.

Not and live to collect their retirement benefits, they don\'t.  This would
be a dire-emergency do-it-or-we-all-die sort of thing.  Getting any
significant work done before the field collapses, and then getting the
J-drive back online and synched up with the field would be quite
challenging.  IMHO, the jump-bubble distortion happens faster than \'hours\'.

This is the sort of thing you spring on the PCs _after_ they\'ve just had an
FGMP fight in the engineering spaces while in jump, and a few stray shots
have hit the drive.

The software is DOS based (command line driven), and should run in any half

actually is, as well as reports on how well it runs on platforms other than
DOS/Win.

That book was way, way too much Niven.  On the other hand, I still reread
Neutron Star regularly, and I try to model my Imperium, ever so slightly,
on a linear combination of the Piper Federation/Empire, and the
Niven/Pournelle Empire.

Yes.  When punching the numbers for real-world weapons, the biggest recoil
numbers are up in the 4-5 range.  FF&S2 recoil numbers are \'meaningless
indications of weapon recoil\' (ie: there aren\'t currently any rules for
using them), but the scale is approximately linear and useful for
comparison.

From my own work, recoil numbers approximately correspond to:
Recoil 0 and 1 = Light recoil.  Controllable by just about anyone who can
  hold the weapon.
  Recoil 0: very light or no recoil at all.
  Recoil 1: light recoil, easilyy controlled.
Recoil 2 = Average.  Controllable by almost anyone, but beings with small
  or weak hands or lower upper-body strength may need practice or special
  weapon holding techniques.
  Recoil 2: About average.  Real-life Colt .45 automatic is in this category.
Recoil 3 and 4 = Heavy recoil.  Large or strong hands and upper body
  mass and strength helpful.
  Recoli 3: Heavy.  Still possible for most people.
  Recoil 4: Very Heavy.  Heaviest recoil for real-life production handguns.
Recoil 5 and beyond = Extreme.  Custom weapons may have been produced in
  real-life at this recoil, but would probably be uncomfortable for most
  shooters.

But I\'d suggest that anything with a \'25\' would probably break your arm
and dislocate your shoulder when firing it (the only plasma pistol I ever
allowed in my own Traveller campaign did that, too).

You should be able to reduce the recoil by increasing the mass of the
weapon, but by the time you got it reasonable, you\'d probably have a rifle,
not a pistol.

> What all this does is beg the question of what exactly the recoil
> numbers in FF&S mean.

They\'re dimensionless numbers that try to express the recoil force felt by
the firer.  The primary factors that determine it are the muzzle energy (the
higher the energy, the more recoil), the relationship of muzzle energy to
weapon mass, and the efficency of the recoil-compensation.  The scale isn\'t
linear (if anything \'25\' means _more_ than 5 times the force of \'5\'), but
bigger numbers mean more recoil.

If piracy would cease to exist, the Imperium would no longer need to waste
it\'s resources on protecting itself from piracy. After a while, someone
would reinvent piracy, since there was no-one to stop it. Thus, the Imperium
would restart it\'s efforts. The pirates would constantly be hunted down, but
there would always be new replacements, hungry for the easy credits.

This is the explanation I prefer to why piracy exists (other than the fact
that it makes for great plots).

I don\'t think anyone disputes the existance of pirates, the dispute is
over the nature of pirates.

Yep. That\'s been the gist of the discussion. On one side, those that
advocate that small, independant pirates (sometimes part time merchies)
with no governmental or corporate support exist; and on the other are
those that contend that the only pirates out there are larger pirates
sponsored by external governments or corporations.

Hmm. Except that you will only be able to see what your senses will let
you. Since your visual sense is limited to 3d, it will only see stimuli in
3d. You\'d have to design 4d glasses that would translate stimuli to 3d to
actually see any 4d phenomena -- and then you\'d only see it in 3d.

Hmm. But are they accurate? I know a lot of people who will confidently
tell me about things are are not! :-)

Still, about visulaizing 4d. In the past, when I was doing a lot of reading
on cosmology, I felt like I became pretty capable with visualizing 4d.
Maybe it\'s the artist in me, but what you do is visualize x, perpendicular
to y, perpendicular to z -- and then imagine another dimension
perpendicular to all of those. It\'s squishy, but it seems like it can be
done, at least in my experience. Of course, this may all be imagination --
I never had access to 4d modeling programs like you are referring to, so I
never tested my accuracy (Arrgh! Where was this topic idea when I was in
Research Methods! :-)

In any event, visualizing a concept and perceiving stimuli are two
different issues. Your senses are limited to 3d in the real world.

Actually, if time is considered a 4th dimension (since it is a way of
measuring things, like the other three), then most humans can visualize in
4d. :) It\'s hyperspace (5d and above) that\'s the real pain.

Of course, and then there are psionics ... :-)

Well, assuming the radiation triggers the photoreceptors you would just see
visible light of some sort. The problem here is not the type of stimuli,
but the fact that the sense receptors react in a specific way. It doesn\'t
matter what the stimuli is -- if it causes your photoreceptors to fire, you
will experience it as light of a visible wavelength.


<examples of physiological mental disorders severed>


But there is no reason to believe that visual stimuli would cause these
effects in a normal person. Now, if looking at certain light or color
patterns made you dysfunctional, then jumpspace might as well -- but they
don\'t seem to (okay, there is TV, I\'ll give you that :-).

Simply *seeing* jumpspace would have no worse of an effect than seeing
anything else. It may look funky or weird, but there is no reason to
believe that it would cause mental breakdown any more than any other sight
would.

Things-that-man-wan-not-meant-to-know aside, jumpspace would most likely
just look like noise (random lights and colors) or nothing at all.

Note that I am *not* advocating an abolishion of jump sickness, or even
psionic handwaves about how jspace might effect the mind. I\'m just the
ranting that the "seeing-it-makes-you-crazy" idea makes little scientific
sense. :-)

Gotta disagree on the point based systems being the only way to go.  They
are good if you have a concept in mind, but they are a pain if you just
need an NPC reasonably fast, or a character who might get fleshed out.
When creating one of these walk-ons, I have _no_ preconceived character
concept, and I like seeing what the dice will give me.  Many of these go
into the file, until I need a character, and someone piques my interest.
Having such a file makes it a lot easier to stop the "has a name -> must be
important" problem.

On the other hand, point systems can be very handy if you are in an
environment where balance is an issue.  I would never run a game with high
school students again without using one, or in a situation where there are
egos involved.  Relatives, or games that have relatives involved can
benefit from points, so people cannot accuse you of favoritism.

You seem to be assuming that the cost of the navy is equal to the cost of
its ships.  This is rather simplistic, but there may be a reason for it.

In case there is not; Remember that one of the single larges expenses the
Imperial Navy will have is salaries and fringe benefits.  This expense will
be big enough to rival the Capital Shipbuilding budget.

In addition there are the following budget categories to consider;
Shipyard maintainence and expense
Naval Intelligence
Research and Development (a biggie!)
Logistics
etc.

Let me know if you\'ve already accounted for these things.

RealCanon: the jump drive does all of its magic just before, during, and
after the jump space entry.  Once you are in jumpspace, go ahead and shut
everything down.

ScottCanon:  Jumpspace is inimical to our spacetime.  The drive field is
created and maintained by the drive.  In order to do that, it slowly goes
through the fuel in the fuel tanks, some for power, but most as a sacrifice
to the gods of jumpspace.  For the technically minded, the hydrogen is
sprayed out as a cloud of ions, which react with the boundary.  The energy
released by this reaction can go to either side, and that which goes to the
other side of the boundary expands it.  That which is released to this side
is rather dangerous, and a well tuned jump drive manages the jump field
such that the there is virtually no radiation, while a jump drive going
sour will have flashes, sparks, and other cool visual effects.

Note: a universe is almost impossible to stabilize at a fixed size - doing
so requires some very interesting gravitational tricks, which the 3I does
not really know.  Doing so is hard enough that creating a stable pocket
universe completely disconnected from any other, and with a fixed size
requires a lot of technology.  Pinched off universes are still connected to
this one, and only must be prevented from popping back through to the
parent, which is a bit easier.

This is relevant, because the whole "dump stuff in jumpspace to keep the
bubble away" thing is a way of preventing your small universe inside
jumpspace from collapsing in on you.

If you understand jumpspace well enough, you can build permanent structures
in it, or do a jump with no fuel at all.  Both of these are well beyond the
understanding of the Imperium, and, in general, are not terribly useful, as
once interstellar teleportation becomes available, the transit time in jump
space is tedious.

In addition, jump space contains a virtually infinite amount of energy, by
the standard of a universe such as ours, so at some point, energy suckers
that just tap raw JS energy become feasible.  Psionic races tend to figure
this out first, as this is the power source for Psionics which cannot be
explained as sensors.

...

By my rules, a partial failure of the drive, the power plant that is part
of the drive, or the jump grid are all disasters, but which can be
recovered from.  In regular traveller, no jump drive failure is a problem
if it happens after JS entry.

>  What could randomly \'fail\' that would keep them in jump?

Any weird happening with the jump drive can have the standard misjump
problems.  Most of them result in death, unless it almost worked right.

Larry Niven is one of the greatest SF writers ever to walk the Earth.  Run,
do not walk, to your bookstore and pick up the following:

Neutron Star
Protector
Tales of Known Space
Lucifer\'s Hammer (w/ Jerry Pournelle)
A World Out of Time (My all-time favorite novel)
N-space
Playgrounds of the Mind

(these two are anniversary collections.. highly recommended)

Dream Park
<can\'t remember>
California Voodoo Game

(these three books are Niven\'s look at the future of role-playing games!)

Legacy of Heorot
Beowulf\'s Children
Destiny\'s Road

(a new series, set on newly colonized worlds.. great for Traveller Refs..)

I know Craig is going to point out the ones I missed, but this will be a
good start.

From personal experience.. I had to spend a week in intensive care about
two years ago.  I was completely immobilized, and unable to move anything.
I also was on morphine, and you cannot sleep for more than five minutes in
an ICU.

After three days, I was hallucinating constantly.  My perspective would
change wildly, I\'d see and hear things that weren\'t there, and finally, I
sat up and pulled my own IV out because I was certain I was back at Ft.
Benning and had to out on patrol.

IMHO, staring at jumpspace will do that to you in a few minutes.  Close the
shutters.

The rumor I contributed for M:0 was about a ship disappearing in jump, and
ships in jumps receiving messages from it.....  <cue Twilight Zone theme..>

Hmm. The argument could be made that piracy suppression exists because the
*threat* of piracy exists.

Still, I think your point is valid. I look at as a dynamic system. Piracy
exists. Piracy supression is developed, and piracy goes away. With piracy
gone, the supression gradually lessens (since human reaction to
non-negative steady states is normally complacency). When supression
reaches a point where it is ineffective, piracy once again rears its ugly
head. To quote a shampoo bottle, "Repeat process."

Throw in a war or two, an Imperium-wide rebellion, and the occasional
intelligent but pissed-off Virus, and you have plenty of opportunities for
piracy.

In a stable, healthy Imperium, there probably is no piracy. The stable,
healthy Imperium is not eternal, however. :-)

Yes they\'e be hosed, but most completion bonds I\'ve seen include daily
penalties for non-compliance...if you\'re late, it\'s $10,000 / day. You
would _much_ rather be late a day or two, than late a week or two...

With interstellar shipping I doubt the time period would usually be
shorter than a week, but depending on the cargo it might be different.

Oh my god!  Hans we agree!!!

Merchants should be 1G.  I was speaking to all the _other_ nasty,

OK.  Now that we have established a base of _merchant_ ships, let\'s
wildly fling some other numbers around:

You are, I assume from the numbers above, postulating a Imperial
population of some 15 Trillion?  Now, assuming that 50% of the citizenry
fail to enter the career path of their choice, that would leave 7.5
Trillion available (at some point in thier lifetime) to the draft.  Of
those, 1/6th or 16.67 percent will enter the Scouts (involuntarily). 
Let\'s round the total number up to 18% to account for those poor,
deluded fools that volunteer to be a scout.  That gives up 1.35 Trillion
Scouts running around space.  Drop 75% for those, who for one reason or
another do not retire as scouts, and that still gives you 337.5 Billion
retirees, approximately 1/6th of whom will recieve a Scout ship in
gratitude to loyal service.  That gives us 56,261,200,000 Type S scouts
that need to be added to that registration file - 10K per file, right? 
So, that pumps the registration data base up another 560 Terabytes of
data for the file.  This, I might add, is just for Type S ships being
retired from active service...do we want to track the active scouts?

Now, most ships over 200 tons have auxiliary craft.  These also need to
be tracked (otherwise how could we determine which craft come from out
of system, as was pointed out to me in an earlier post).  Let\'s assume
only 1 aux. craft per ship (rounds out the numbers for those who have
more, and those who have none) which will give us another 37,500,000. 
Then, these are also the craft that link the various worlds, moons, and
orbital platforms.  Let us just suppose there are 1 craft per 1,000
citizens (government, corporate and private) - that gives us another
15,000,000,000 and a total of 52.5 Billion.  At 10K per entry - another
520 Terabytes of data!

I would add all the various Lab Ships, Couriers, Type J (seekers), but
they would just be more numbers.  If we are adding military ships
(necessary I think, how else to verify that they are legitamate) it
would add considerably to the database, but since I currently disagree
with the numbers being used, I won\'t add them in.  I think it would be
safe to say, however, that it would easily double, and perhaps triple
the size of the registry.

However, I believe that this registry has also been postulated to
contain the Captain and Crew information as well (rubbing hands and
looking worriedly at calculator...will it be up to the task?  Is that
smoke?)

15 Trillion Imperial citizens, 50% of which select their own careers. 
16.67% go Navy (round up to 20% - there is a prestige in the Navy),
16.67% go merchant (round up to 20% - there is money in business), and
18% go scout.  This is 4.35 Trillion citizens who get thier ticket as
Pilot, Engineer, Astrogator or Gunner.  I\'ll be kind and only round up
to 5 Trillion for those who get one of these skills in another manner,
and for those Medics who get ship certified.  That is another 50,000
Terabytes for the registry.

So, assuming the database only has data for civilian ships, we are
looking at 1,080.375 Terabytes of data for the defined ships. 
(Conservatively, I would double that for the undefined ships), and
another 50,000 Terabytes for crew.  (I sure as hell wouldn\'t want to be
an Imperial DBA)  Do we include interface shipping (ships from out of
the Empire?)

Now, updates.  If we assume that .1% of the data is being updated or
changed at any given time (and I think we will all agree that this is a
_very_ small % of change), that is 51 terabytes of data on the wire
(more specifically, in the X-boat) at any given time.  I don\'t remember
what the amount of data a given X-boat can carry, but I believe it was
in the terabyte range.  Just the add/remove/change information for this
database will consume a significant amount of the space available for
data.

(The calculator is begging for mercy - the solar power cell is smoking. 
I must stop now!  :)

I went over the recoil calculations and they are correct.  I saw that the 
equation for slug throwers was much less 0.15 v. 150.  But then i saw the 
small print.  For slug throwers this factor is multiplied by the Muzzle 
energy in Joules.  High energy weapons are calculated with MEGAjoules!  As a 
matter of fact when I converted the energy of the "Cricket" to joules and 
plugged it into the slug thrower recoil equation, it worked to the same 
number.

There is quite an order of magnitude between slug throwers and High Energy 
weapons, maybe we should produce Laser weapons, hardly any recoil with 
those...NAW! :-)

I see now that high energy weapons are brutish, "forged in the bowels of 
Hades" (or X-TEK R&D), infernal weapons of death and mass destruction and 
are not to be trifled with.

Mind you, at higher techs, Fusion Pistols are very possible, and the recoil, 
albeit very high (7 IIRC) it is tolerable.  Draconis Cluster website has 
such a pistol at TL-16.  Ah the marvels of Gravatic Compensation! :)

Agreed.

I tried adding more ammo, but recoil is still gawddawfuly huge.  Anything 
bigger would be a rifle true.  Which leads to a question I had.  How do you 
find out how wide and how long the barrel of the thing is?

IIRC this is a throwback from TNE days when the combat rules use a recoil 
factor to see how many shots could be fired in a turn before the weapon 
became uncontrollable.  IIRC it was based on STR.  The total number of shots 
fired in a turn were added up and if the total was greater than strength, 
the difference was used as a negative DM to hit.

Mind you there were no rules for excessive recoil, prolly cuz back then 
there were no insane designers like the Commander and Hegebar Spofulam! (TEE 
HEE!)

I would say if a weapon has a single shot recoil of over x2 your strength, a 
formidable roll v. Endurance should be made to avoid injury(take remaining 
recoil points subtracted from STR and distribute evenly over STR DEX and 
END).  At 3x and over its Staggering, at 4x and over Imposible.  The damage 
is the same Recoil-STR so at higher levels it is potentially fatal. If the 
END roll is successful, then only 1/2 damage is inflicted. You WILL get hurt 
firing the "Cricket"!

By the way ...

OK, OK ... so I am not well-read in SF litterature, but I will be :-)

Who is Heinlein, and are there any more authors I ought to know about?

I *do* know Asimov, Gibson and Arthur C Clarke but the rest is vastly
unexplored terrain for me (I need to do a first survey of SF litterature :-)

This one point I\'ve tired to make.  Crimes are very seldom
"wiped out".  What happens is that resources are committed to
a point where the resources required to further reduction
are balanced by the costs of the exsiting level of crime.

  Perhaps more correctly, the existence of such forces indicates the
pre-conditions for what they work to suppress. If crime were not a
human behaviour option, then we wouldn\'t have police or crime. Or,
disease controls is why we _don\'t_ have smallpox.

interesting ... effects of all types in jumpspace:

Suppose that the interface between raw jumpspace and the
normalspace bubble that is around your ship has some unique
qualities that result in interactions that happen faster than
light, but do so on the "inside" of the jump bubble.

Suppose further that these interactions generate "radiation" (no
better description) that can affect human nerve tissue.

Suppose further that this pseudoradiation cannot penetrate
materials opaque to visible light, but have no problem going
through transparent materials.

When this pseudoradiation, which is moving faster than light in
an environment where this is theoretically prohibited, strikes
neural tissue, it sets up a "resonance" of some sort - it is the
effects of the resonance that cause jump insanity - and in fact,
all jump sickness.  A misjump induces severe jump sickness
because part of the interaction happened inside the ship, where
people would be affected.

Ramifications:=20

It is a nasty job to do EVA in jump - possible if you have an
opaque helmet with a repeater HUD in it, to mimic vision, or if
your view is of nothing but hull - no Jspace _at_all_, but still
not pleasant because of the closeness of the interface boundary.

It is not safe to be in a room with uncovered viewports.  Screens
showing what a port would show are OK, though.

It explains why people are affected differently by viewing
jumpspace and by jump sickness - the resonance is more or less
severe; in some rare cases, there is no effect at all - these are
the people who seem to be totally immune to jump sickness, and
who can look out a port while in jump with no ill effects.

It is not actually _seeing_ jumpspace that does it, but being
exposed to it as described - it\'s just that humans are visually-
oriented, and have assumed that, since it can happen on the
bridge of a ship with an open viewport, it must be from looking
at it.

The few people that are driven irrevocably mad by exposure to
Jspace are those where the Jspace/neural resonance is at a sort
of "natural harmonic" of the person\'s nervous system; the
resonance set up is self-reinforcing, and continues even after
the inducing agent (Jspace pseudoradiation) is removed.

That\'s really amazing, for someone interested in science fiction,
especially "hard" science science fiction, not to have heard of Larry
Niven.  So go, run, don\'t walk, to the bookstore or library and read
some of his work.  He\'s both a very good writer, and a very imaginative
thinker.  I hope that you enjoy his writing as much as I (and everyone I
know in this context) have.  

..se means Sweden, right?  At least his major works are likely to have
been translated into Swedish, and your posts suggest that your English
is quite fluent.  You should be able to find him in either language at a
major bookstore.  

Look for these books:

Ringworld (his best-known novel)
The Ringworld Engineers (sequel)
Protector

There are a lot of others, but I can\'t remember any other titles.  You
might find a list on the web.

Happy reading!

to propose my alternative to the Imperium-wide ship registry.

I should point out that this is already partially instituted in my
campaign - partially only because I\'ve never bothered to formalize it
before.

I have mentioned in an previous post that I route ship\'s paperwork and
payments to the capital of subsector where the ship is built.  From
there, the ship registry and qualified crew listing is published to all
A, B and C Starports in the subsector.  Also, copies of the sub-sector
listing are posted to the surrounding subsectors on a monthly basis, and
forwarded to the Sector Capital for archiving.

Note I mentioned the \'qualified crew\' listing.  IMHO, all crewmembers in
\'named\' positions (Pilot, Astrogator, Engineer, Medic, Gunner) must have
certifications in order to legally fill the position (i.e. get paid for
it).  In addition, every ship must have a qualified pilot on board to
lift.

Ships on patrol duty have an abbrieviated version of the list, just a
transponder code, file number, ship class and tonnage and a warrant
flag.  If they run across a ship that they require more information on,
they need to contact the nearest Class A,B or C starport.  Capital Ships
(BBs and above) also have this information, as do Naval Bases.  (They
won\'t give it to the Scouts since it was discovered that they were
allowing retired scouts access to the database.)

Updates to the database flow from the reporting station to the SubSector
Capital \'owning\' the record.  Each time a ship ports at one of these
starports, updates are sent.  Once a ship has crossed a subsector
border, the file \'ownership\' will be transferred to the new subsector. 
During the change of ownership process, data will originally flow to the
old owner who will forward it to the new owner.  As the new owner
broadcasts it\'s file updates, data flow will transfer from the old to
the new owner.  During this process, the adjacent 3 subsectors will
begin receiving data on this ship, and the far 3 subsectors will receive
\'remove\' notices to reduce the size of the database.  On Day 1 each year
the Sector Capital archives the data and forwards a copy to Capital.

Crew lists are handled in roughly the same fashion.  It should be noted
that, with the exception of \'notable\' people - most of a person\'s record
is kept on their Imperial ID and archived in the SubSector Capital. 
Losing your ID can result in a considerable waiting period while you
wait for a new ID to be issued.

Not everyone will have a Imperial ID.  It only need be issued when you
are first leaving your homeworld.  Thus, if you never leave (legally),
you may never get an ID.  The process to recieve one is fairly simple on
TL 7+ worlds, but the data has to be manually authenticated on TL 6-
worlds.  (These worlds are popular places to create new IDs)  Additions
and modifications to an Imperial ID must be authorized by a noble or a
designated subordinate.

Points of interest:
1) With the data flow converging on the SubSector and Sector capitals,
it is possible to incorporate changes to the database (assuming you can
get write access).  Failure to a forgery roll indicates that your record
will be flagged for investigation.  Spectacular Failure indicates that
built in security scans will immediately detect the change (race ya off
planet!)

2) Patrols on remote duty (Class D and E Starport systems) will only be
able to verify if the transponder is valid.  They can record
information, but it will not be crosschecked until they can get access
to a full database.  (Which is why pirates won\'t play in a system where
a Battleship is visiting, even if it is across the system)

3) I _do_ pull certifications from players (I pulled the Pilot-4\'s
ticket for buzzing the field - they had to hire a Pilot-1 to get
clearance to leave port!), they can be restored (after the fine is paid
and the probation is completed) by taking a test and paying cr100.  They
are good for 2 years.  Merchants must certify their ships annually to
carry cargo and/or passengers.

I\'ve never read that one, but I did think Heinlien\'s "Friday" had good
treatment of the issue.  There were cameras, but you never knew for sure
if they were being monitored or not.  And there was a good story (\'Oath
of Fealty\' by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle) about an arcology and the
security issues there.  (Tho\' the diving board on the roof to put off
would be suicides was a bit over the top...)

You know, for me, this is as good a description of the way things were in
the Ziruu Sirkaa as you\'d get. One of the major reasons the Long Night
happened were those individualistic, freedom-loving Solomani broke down the
system that had kept piracy impossible.

For me, the reason the early 3I allows armed starships in private hands is
because of the threat of pirates based in other governments. For the
reasons Hans has pointed out at length, piracy just wont happen *within*
empires. At the fringes of an empire, things are a different story - if you
can flee outside the reach of the Navy and Imperial Bureaucracy, then
stealing starships becomes much more worthwhile. Wars also start, because
one side gets sick of the other harbouring pirates, but thats another story.

In the first century or so of the Imperium, the border to run to is close,
so piracy is possible. Once the border is too far away, then piracy becomes
more and more difficult. The analogy I\'m thinking of is the bushrangers of
Australia and the bandit gangs of the US. When the frontier ran out, then
the bushrangers had nowhere to run, and they ended up hung.

Similarly, I believe that privately-owned starship weaponary got rarer the
further into the core of the Third Imperium you got, because it was both
less necessary and more regulated. What is a "reasonable precaution" on the
Rim becomes noteworthy and then questionable the closer to Capital you get
.... after all, a single 250 megawatt laser could commit a quite spectacular
terrorist atrocity (just acclerating your ship into whatever wont work ...
the deep meson site will vape you before impact).

With the bureaucracy stuff, remember the Vilani ancestry of much of the
Third Imperium - and the fact that the Frontier is somewhere to go to run
away from the bloody paperwork ...

I don\'t know about metal, but what about granite?  It will last for hundreds of
millions of years.  A large granite plaque with very deep lettering should make
an interesting and obvious artifact.  Of course, one might interpret it as a
relic of a primitive lost civilisation of ones own species, rather than an alien
artifact.

I prefer reading in the author\'s own language whenever possible (possible
means English or Swedish texts). That way I both get to enjoy the books
more, and I learn some more English in the process. I am the gamemaster
(referee, storyteller) for three different RPG\'s, all of them English, and I
play several more English games.

[flash of insight]

Ringworld?! Niven wrote Ringworld?! In that case, I *have* read some of his
works, although that was quite a while ago (about seven years, which means a
little more than a third of my life...). I even played a Ringworld RPG once,
but the GM for that game moved, and he took his books with him :-(

Thank you. You WILL be right about that, I am sure.

I\'ll have to go dig it out, but I _think_ recently posted a design of a
plasma handgun that was quite nice...kinda heavy, but quite
manageable...(or maybe I thought about posting it and forgot to)? 

There\'s no lower energy limit to plasma weapons in the design sequence!  I
think mine ended up being a 10 or 15 _kjoule_ weapon. Damned if I can
find it right now, though...I\'ll look at the recoil numbers on it at home.

If the jump bubble really *does* separate the "physics" of two universes
(ie: J-space and the N-space occupying the inside of the bubble), it would
actually make sense that the bubble doesn\'t allow the jump space equivalent
of "light" to pass through it in the first place.  If not, if light can
pass through, perhaps time can also (ouch!).

I envision the inside of a jump bubble as appearing as the inside of a
perfectly polished mirror.  If you are running external lights or open a
window shutter, you see a concave distortional view of the ship (and
yourself) looking back at you.  This would create an artificial sense of
claustrophobia, heightening the very real fact that a meter or so beyond
the ship is another dimension entirely (trying to wrap your brain around
the reality of that situation *could* very well cause "jump sickness" in
some individuals).

I was just paraphrasing some of what Claudia said in rebuttal to JMS\'
reasons for her leaving, found on a webpage I visited a few months ago (of
course, I cannot for the life of me remember the URL).  Apparently
*someone* isn\'t telling the truth, but I\'m not about to finger anyone with
any certainty.  I did say *allegedly*, after all.  And after seeing her
performance in the season finale last night (her best *ever*, IMHO), it
will truly be sad to see her go :(

   Sheesh! For the Nth time now...  (Am I sending these posts into a bit dump?)
   
   Hans is using the TCS figure of an /annual/ budget of 10% of the fleet
   cost per year.  This /includes/ things like salaries, benefits,
   ammunition, environmental restoration, bases, maintainance,
   administration, hospitals, hangers, schools, office supplies, and
   everything else in addition to the cost of the ships.

   In fact, the total of all the above expenses will be about 4 times
   that budget, if present day military reality is any guide.  But these
   numbers ARE INCLUDED in the annual budget that Hans uses.

   All these things are accounted in the annual budgets that TCS supposes
   (and Hans uses).  And these suppositions are not so different from the
   present day military and economic reality of the USA.  If you don\'t
   believe me, just let me know and I\'ll email you a copy of the 1997
   US Naval budget.  (I\'ve already posted this budget to the TML twice
   now.)

	Of course the astrogator has still work, he\'is "viewing" the jump

	Certainly. I don\'t remember the part about a jump from the surface causing
damage to the planet from any version of the "official" descriptions ...
The ship attempting jump won\'t do much damage to the planet, but it\'ll sure
wipe itself out as random molecules drop out of jump space all the way from
here to Andromeda. Voila! A flashy way to commit suicide AND scatter your

	I\'ve build a container Liner with 3,7G. Oh this ship has only
	this accelleration if he drops the containers clipped under.

	Its a well armed Liner, 2 xray lasers, 2 tuneable, 2 sandcasters,
	4 meson guns at TL:D. The TL:F version has also a black globe
	and a meson screen. If the cargo is droped the ship has 360dt,
	and can outfight most oponents of that size.

	Why can he compete - Its TNE and those Liners are trading in
	escord fleets, normal fleet size is 6 Liners, 12 200dt Traders,
	12 80dt Prospectors and 36 fighters.

	High risk - high profit.  Ever dealed with the devil ;-)

	Those ships could\'nt compete in the Regency (price for the
	hull+drive is 400 MCr for 240dt cargo Jump4) but they can
	compete in the wilds, and with a CruRon as close escord
	even in the event horizon.

	A recent article by a historian (in Smithsonian\'s "Air And Space"
magazine) argued, based on physics, flame spread, color, and the _slow_
rate of combustion, that the Hindenburg disaster was caused by the
_envelope_ igniting, not a hydrogen fire.

OK, I\'m curious.  You have a Laser hit the fuel tank, pass through, and
pierce the interior passageways of the ship.  Obviously you are expeling
LHyd into space (until a baffle seals the hole), but you are also
spewing it into the ship.

Suppose the ship had not been vented, normal atmosphere available.

I am assuming a fire starts where the laser pierces the bulkhead - LHyd
spews all over it.  What happens?

1) Lots of fire - with H2 feeding

2) Interior explosion

3) LHyd puts out fire (cools it below ignition point) and floods
passageway (until a baffle seals the hole)

4) Something totally else

	I\'ve always considered the inertial compensator and the artificial gravity
to be somewhat different devices, so that even the "Star Trek" style ships
can accelerate up to the limits of their G-compensation. That leaves the
interior a 0G relative acceleration, on which the artificial gravity is
superimposed.

	Easy--IC/AG isn\'t a field projected out from the deck plates, it\'s a field
projected BETWEEN the deck and ceiling plates. It affects everything that\'s
between the plates, but unless you can get the derelict between decks where
it\'s in the field ....

	Again, if you\'re using the "between plates" field, it can only go one way.
But you can wrap the plates around a torus to provide the constant "out"
grav field of the old lab ship.

>cargo just \'falls\' in and out of the hold instead of needing cranes or
>loaders? You could set them to fractional Gs to avoid damage.

	To do this, you\'d have to have a movable plate "in front of" the cargo,
which can set up the field between itself and the plate "behind" the cargo,
and then get the movable plate out of the way so it doesn\'t get hit.

No, you can see a 3d "projection" of a 4d event, just like a drawing or
picture is a 2d projection of a 3d event.

Well, another take on things is the jump makes you 4 dimensional. And
while around other 3d objects that have been converted you are pretty
much ok. But just wait until your senses have to deal with *real* 4d
objects. 

This gets around the "you can only perceive 3d" bit. :-)

On the other hand, while ships have *big* problems with flooding
compartments, spaceships aren\'t going to have *near* the hassles with
venting a compartment to vacuum.

Sure, but the hydrogen sources on the ship are rather more
concentrated. You\'ll note that the Hindenburg *burned* rather than
exploded. That\'s because the oxygen and hydrogen can\'t mix fast enough
on that scale.

This is not specified in the rules. And there is some disagreement on

I don\'t think *anyone* has ever advocated the possibility of a failure
leaving you in Jump space. What has been advocated is that if the Jump
"bubble" fails, the ship is no longer protected from jumpspace (sort of
like throwing the whole ship thru the "interface".

What maintains the bubble is a good question. Probably the hull grid at
a *minimum*. Possible other parts of the drive as well.

I\'m of the "once you make it into jump you can relax" school. So I\'d
say that once you get into jump, you are committed. The time and place
you come out is already determined. So you could chop the drive (and
even the hull grid :-) into little pieces and throw it out the airlock.

I "justify" this by noting that the only time the j-drive is using
power (according to the rules) is as you get ready to jump.

I am, but those are indeed a very good start.

First, *after* reading (at least) most of the Known Space short stories,
plus Protector and (if you can find it) World of Ptavvs, *then* read
Ringworld.  It\'s a stupendous novel, but it\'s far better if you\'re up on
the Known Space background going in.

Read "Footfall" and "The Mote in God\'s Eye" for two very different looks
at first contact with aliens.  "Mote" is on my all-time-best SF list,
along with Ringworld.

Gods, I envy anyone having all this to read for the first time...

(By the way, I agree with whoever noted that "Ringworld Throne" is a
clunker.  Also, "Gripping Hand" sucked in a deep and lasting way.  Ah,
well, even Homer nods. D\'oh! :)

<glancing up at his 5 foot shelf of Heinlein> oboy....

Robert Heinlein is one of the all-time greats ...from his early days as a
\'Golden Age\' pulp writer to his later, far more complex novels.


IF it\'s still in print or you can find it in a used bookstore or the
library, look up: The Past Through Tomorrow, the epic collection of his
future history series. The stories that make up this cycle were also
reprinted in a number of shorter books, The Green Hills of Earth, The Man
Who Sold the Moon, Methuselah\'s Children, Revolt in 2100, and the Menace
from Earth, among others.

Be aware, that a number of these stories were originally written for
markets like Boy\'s Life, and are juveniles in content.

There are also his juvenile novels, like Have Spacesuit, Will Travel,  The
Rolling Stones, Podykayne of Mars, Starman Jones, Tunnel in the Sky,
Farmer in the Sky.

In the late 50\'s and early 60\'s he started writing novels with more adult
themes, starting, IMHO with his greatest, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,
followed by Stranger in a Strange Land. Others in this era are Starship
Troopers, and the capstone of his Future History series, Time Enough for
Love.

His later books, in the 70\'s and 80\'s became more entwined with playing
with the concept of fictional universes, as he recycled and resurrected
characters from disparate stories, tossed them all about, and developed a
grand battle twixt good and evil across his \'multiverse\'. Friday is a
representative of this era, as is Job: A Comedy of Justice.

Other authors who are must-reads:

All the Flandry of Terra books you can find by Fritz Liebler. Actually,
anything by Fritz Liebler is good, but the Flandry series have contributed
to Traveller canon.

Keith Laumer wrote the Retief series, another very Traveller-ish series of
stories and novels.

Larry Niven\'s frequent writing partner, Jerry Pournelle has also
contributed, Mote in God\'s Eye, and it\'s sequel The Gripping hand\' both
coauthored with Niven, and his C0-dominum novels, such as King David\'s
Spaceship, and Prince Mercenaries.

Gordon R. Dickson is another good hard SF author, as is Hal Clement and
Fred Saberhagen, whose Berserker series, about ancient maevolent robot
warships are a distinct source for Virus in TNE.

H. Beam Piper\'s Space Viking was translated almost directly into
Traveller. (The Sword Worlds confederation, despite anything _anyone_ says
has been translplanted directly into the Spinward Marches) His Little
Fuzzy novels (Little Fuzzy and Fuzzy Sapiens) while not very hard SF are
utterly kneeslapping rib-hurting funny.

Continuing in the comedy vein, get the Stainless Steel Rat series by Harry
Harrison, who also wrote the Bill, the Galactic Hero series. 

Ahhh, what else? Joe Haldeman\'s The Forever War is a wrenching look at
what war in a relatavistic universe would be like.

I could go on and on, and haven\'t even touched on the books mentioned by
many others on this list, like C.J. Cherryh\'s SF novels, and on and on.

A First Survey of SF...wow...I\'ve been reading it for almost 30 years now,
and I\'m still on that first survey.. ;-)

Good; it\'s supposed to do that.  For whatever it\'s worth, the "cricket"
has a muzzle energy of 0.0625Mj - approximately equivalent to a standard
20mm cannon (personally, I don\'t want that going off in my hand).

Yep.  The only one I ever had in one of my games was the PPMP-16X (Plasma
Pistol, Man-Portable, TL-16, Experimental).  It was fired a grand total of
once (and broke the wrist of the Vargr who shot it).  Oh, yes - it was a
miss, too.

>How do you find out how wide and how long the barrel of the thing is?

There really isn\'t a dimension available for plasma weapons (other than
\'big honkin huge\').  I think that visualizing some of the gear from MIB 
is probably appropriate.  Given the energy, I doubt that the muzzle is 
significantly less than an inch accross ...

Right.  I don\'t remember exactly how they were used, and my T:TNE stuff is
packed right now.

That sounds reasonable ... as do your rules for generating tasks versus
getting injured.

One thing to note about weapons designs ... I know this sounds obvious, but
I think I\'d better mention it.  Referees always have the final say in what is 
and isn\'t allowed in their campaigns.  Just because something is buildable
with FF&S2 doesn\'t mean it has to appear in your campaign.

Or that "calibrating" the J-drive can only be down in normal space.
Which actually makes sense when you think about it.

I agree with the guy who once posted that looking at jump space doesn\'t
drive you crazy, being locked in a cabin the size of a closet for weeks
with a bunch of ex-military crewmembers and having nothing else *but* jump
space to look at drives you crazy.

On the other hand, maybe naked jump space looks *exactly* like William
Shatner music videos, reruns of the Police Academy movies, and talk-show
interviews of Melanie Griffith. That would drive anyone insane.

Since population codes are powers of ten, this formula leads to a
significant imbalance of the traffic per capita. A TL 10 population 1
planet requires 1 Kton per year to support each inhabitant, while a
population 10 planet requires only 1/10000 of one ton per person.

I don\'t know if this is the kind of "balance" you are looking for.

One of my players read Mote and commented to me that it has a very
Traveller-esque feel to it. I agreed completely.

Also, don\'t forget Lucifer\'s Hammer, a story about a comet hitting
Earth.

Oh, my ...

Robert Anson Heinlien.  One of the undisputed Grand Masters of Science
Fiction (the other two are Asimov and Clarke, by the way).  Definitely read
most of his "future histories", and pretty much anything else he wrote.  In
particular, look for: _The Past Through Tomorrow_, _Citizen of the Galaxy_,
_The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, _Time Enough
for Love_, _Methuselah\'s Stepchildren_, and a couple of the juveniles, if
you can find them: _Starship Troopers_, _Podkayne of Mars_, _The Rolling
Stones_.  As far as I can tell, Heinlien invented the waterbed, and the
creature that David Gerrold renamed a \'tribble\' (Heinlien called them \'Martian
Flatcats\') and made famous on Star Trek.

> I *do* know Asimov, Gibson and Arthur C Clarke but the rest is vastly
> unexplored terrain for me (I need to do a first survey of SF litterature :-)

Here\'s some more to take a look at (and hopefully, my suggestions won\'t
dumplicate many others, since I tend to specialize in that \'good old-time
SF\'):

Edward E. "Doc" Smith.  Heinlien\'s mentor, and originator of many of the
themes used so often in "classic" space opera (including powered armor, 
later made famous by Heinlien in _Starship Troopers_ and adopted into
Traveller as "Battle Dress").  Read the Lensmen Series (_Triplanetary_,
_First Lensman_, _Space Patrol_, _Second-Stage Lensman_, and _Children of
the Lens_ if I remember correctly).  If you really like the Lensmen books,
pick up a copy of _GURPS Lensmen_ from SJG (it\'s the supplement that made
me go out and buy GURPS - but then again, I\'m a Doc Smith fan).

James H. Schmitz.  Whatever you can find - if nothing else, NESFA has _The
Very Best of James H. Schmitz_ in print.  Particularly, read _Legacy_ (aka
_A Tale of Two Clocks_) for an idea of the kinds of things you can do with
forerunner civilizations.  If you\'re going to do a heavily psionic campaign,
I feel that _Universe Against Her_, _Telzey Toy_, and _The Lion Game_ are
must-read books.  I particularly like the way that Schmitz handles psionics,
but then again, I\'m a Schmitz fan.

Additional things to read (that may be recommended by others, too):

Gordon R. Dickson.  If you\'re running a campaign that features military
adventures, Dickson\'s Dorsai books are a must-read.  You owe it to yourself
and your players to check out _The Tactics of Mistake_, _Dorsai!_, and 
several others in the cycle.

David Drake.  Another must-read for military or mercenary campaigns.  His
_Hammer\'s Slammers_ was quite popular, and is a good SF/military read.

C.J. Cherryh.  I highly recommend _Pride of Chanur_ (and follow-on works)
for all Traveller players.  Although the Hani (cat-like aliens) are vaguely
like Aslan*, it\'s a case of parallel evolution (both were written up at
nearly exactly the same time.

Fred Saberhagen.  _Berzerker_ and subsequent books are recommended if you\'d
like to play in the New Era with Vampire Fleets and all that.  Although the
writers of T:TNE were unaware of Saberhagen\'s work (and I believe them, they
seemed to be pretty unaware of most of Traveller\'s Hard SF background), the
Vampires are Pretty Darn Close to Berzerkers in most respects (and IMHO
Saberhagen does it better).

Dr. Robert L. Forward.  _Dragon\'s Egg_.
George O. Smith.  _Venus Equilateral_.

Since nobody can be serious all the time, check out _Earthman\'s Burden_
by Anderson and Dickson.  It\'s SF, it\'s funny, and it\'s a good read.

There\'s more, but that\'ll give you a start, anyway (and besides, my SF
books are packed, so there are plenty more titles and authors, but I
can\'t double-check them).

* For new players, my one-sentance description of the Aslan is "Imagine, if
  you will, male Kzinti and female Hani merged into one race - it\'s not 
  accurate, but it\'ll give you a feel for the Aslan."  Most players who\'ve 
  read both Niven and Cherryh go pale, and try to avoid annoying the nice 
  Aslan they just met. ;-)

Don\'t forget David Drake\'s _Lacey and his Friends_, which contains not one,
but several mysteries set in a future where everyone is (potentially)

Perhaps the initial numbers were a bit skewed, but is the process 
incorrect?  Admittedly, I have gotten a bit frustrated about the way some 
numbers are tossed into the discussion, and then forever after accepted as 
fact.  But, even if we reduce all then numbers by 99%, as you suggest, we 
still end up with a database that includes 10 Tbytes of ship data, 50 
Tbytes of personnel data, and keeps 500 Gbytes of change data on the wire 
at any given time.

I did, however, propose an alternative (see Ship\'s Registration and Crew 
Certification) - is this more reasonable?

  Actually, this presents a great point. If outrunning a "suspicion of
piracy/smuggling/not honouring the Emperor\'s Birthday" notice (or just
skipping on your payments) were real easy (for, say, J-2+ ships) why
even bother pirating a cargo at all?

  Have a crooked contact (at least as common as a fence) ship a well-
insured cargo via your ship, have a special friend pirate your ship,
and then you both collect your respective loot. You may never see your
friend again, but who cares? OC, if he stiffs you on the goods you can
always retaliate by actually delivering them...

  Therefore, some sort of licensing or effective policing mechanism
must exist, or this would be common, leading to the foregoing, etc.

  A Pac-man has around 4000 crew at, say Cr 2000/mo., before pensions and
benefits, or ~MCr 100 pa. The ship costs BCr 300+ (?) and a "canonical"
maintenance (including what?) of 10%. The ships\' payroll are not a major
factor.

>In addition there are the following budget categories to consider;
>Shipyard maintainence and expense

  Any "A" starport of the correct TL will have the facilities anyways, for
the large pool of civilian shipping out there. Perhaps only the Depots will
be purely (Imperial) naval shipyards. Also, a very good case can be (and has
been, IIRC) made that these things are covered under the 10% TCS maintenance.

>Naval Intelligence

  How much can that cost? (Longbow aside)

>Research and Development (a biggie!)

  Only relevant to TL 15 worlds, and the Imperial gov\'t as a whole. But, any
research is likely military-applicable in the background. Direct comparisons
to the US military-industrial complex are not necessarily valid.

Eris,
I like a lot of your ideas, and can see some redesigning in the near future.
Never thought of the double hull trick but I do like it. I\'ve been trying to
include crawl ways (mostly for creeping up on people, \'specially on larger
ships) but the space between inner and outer hull is even better. What do
you design ship deck plans in? I\'m mostly using Corel Draw 6 or any of the
bitmap formats. I\'d like to exchange some plans if possible.

Darn, I wish I had caught this in the original reply!

There are many, many hazards aboard a modern Navy ship, the magazine is 
just one of them.  JP-5 (aircraft fuel and used for the gas turbine ships) 
is extremely hazardous.  Not sitting in a fuel tank, but in the lines, 
which when pierced spray JP-5, that is when it is very flammable. 
 Hydraulic fluid, when sprayed, is explosive.  Magnesium, used in the 
airframes of many aircraft, will not only burn at high temperatures, but 
once it starts burning it can\'t be put out by conventional means.  Other 
dangers aboard ships - the deep fat fryers, medicinal alcohol, paint, paint 
thinner, many of the solvents that are used.  The list goes on and on.

However, when you are feeding it from the high pressure air system (holed 
in a hit), you end up with the equivalent of a blow torch, even in a 
nominal vacuum.

If you have a fire hot enough, anything will burn.  (Lesson from Navy fire

Killing the drive is just a fancy way of sticking a gun to your head.

This is not specified in the rules. And there is some disagreement on

I don\'t think *anyone* has ever advocated the possibility of a failure
leaving you in Jump space. What has been advocated is that if the Jump
"bubble" fails, the ship is no longer protected from jumpspace (sort of
like throwing the whole ship thru the "interface".

What maintains the bubble is a good question. Probably the hull grid at
a *minimum*. Possible other parts of the drive as well.

I\'m of the "once you make it into jump you can relax" school. So I\'d
say that once you get into jump, you are committed. The time and place
you come out is already determined. So you could chop the drive (and
even the hull grid :-) into little pieces and throw it out the airlock.

I "justify" this by noting that the only time the j-drive is using
power (according to the rules) is as you get ready to jump.

I think we need to establish some basics before the thread erupts into a
flamewar (which I see building).  Realistically, before we can determine
if piracy is practical, some of the points that are ...vague, in canon
need to be addressed.  They are:

1) Just how much space traffic is there (both inter- and intra- system)?

System that I proposed (not a lot of traffic on that thread, can I assume 
we are in agreement?):

(World TL*(Pop Code^2)) Ktons per year

x1.5 if Starport B
x2 if Starport A

x2 if the world is AG or is Ri
x3 if the world has a military base or is a Capital
x4 if the world is Ind

2) How good are the various sensor platforms at the various tech levels?
Conversely, how good are the various stealth platforms at the various
tech levels?

Sensor technology appears to be more effective than generally available 
masking technology.  The main thrust of disagreement remaining seems to be 
over just how identifiable a given ship will be, if it is attempting to 
conceal it\'s true identity, size, etc...

3) At what TL can a system support (not build or develop, buy and
support) a planetary, orbital, and system defense network?  At what TL
can a system support a planetary, orbital, and system detection network?

Has not been addressed as yet

4) What are the duties of an SDB when the Imperium is not at war.  What
would a rotation cycle be (ie how long would it be on duty before it
could stand down for R&R, maintenance, etc)

Has not been addressed as yet

5) How involved is the IN in anti-piracy work, or is that the province
of another department (like the scouts)?  Just how much of the presumed
5% of GWP that goes to the military goes to the IN?  How do the
subsector and planetary forces fit in?

I think we have determined that the IN is *ahem* very involved.  Just what 
the budget is seems to still be under debate, tho\' it appears most of the 
list is content with the 5% rule.  What it is used for, and how much the 
other branches get has not been resolved.

6) How much of the industrial capacity is reserved for the IN?  What is
the base TL of the IN, and how does that affect access to the high TL
shipyards for others?  How easy is it to retrofit high TL items (sensors
and stealth equipment) onto an existing ship?

Has not been addressed as yet

7) How corruptable are starport officials?  (Both STC and shipyard)

Appears to be fairly simple, as long as you are careful.

8) How easy/difficult is it to forge, alter, create or manipulate ship
identification, papers, transponders, etc?  What market would there be
for cargo, starship parts, starships and the like?

Forging the transponder is difficult to impossible.  Adding additional 
transponders seems to be the concensus.

Ship\'s registration is under debate.

Market for ships appears to be somewhat limited.  10-20% value (more if you 
can get it out of the Empire?).

I didn\'t catch whether or not we agreed on standard parts.  The last two 
posts both supported standardized parts, but one of the posts was mine.  Is 
this point settled?

I know that battle lines in this debate have been drawn.  Let\'s redraw
them, or drop the thread.

Yes. ;->  Pournelle and Niven co-wrote the Motie books.

Include the Dreampark books, all of the "Known Space" books (inventing the
Protectors, Kitzi, Puppeteers, Beowolf Shaffer, Gil Hamilton of Arm and the
Ringworld..not the idea, the place ;-), a huge number of excellent short
stories ("Inconstant Moon", "The Hole Man", and "Spirals"), the universe of
"The Magic Goes Away" and any number of essays like "Man of Steel, Woman of
Kleenex." ;-D

IMO, Niven is among a handful of authors that *all* science fiction fans
should be familiar with.

Valid, but I doubt the premise; You may keep anti-piracy forces to prevent
an outbvreak of piracy, just as countries keep armies even though theyt are
not at war.
Alternately, consider the claim that 
\'if there were no widespread polio in Australia, then the government would
not spend money on large stocks of polio vaccine.\'  The governament may
prudently keep large stocks of vacccine even though there is no polio epidemic.

where the hydogen (now gas) and air meet - enough air for combustion.

Eventually, the air reaches an explosive mixture. That is, just enough
oxygen and hydrogen mixed (this works with methane - I assume it works as
well with hydrogen) to stop burning at the fringe and instead to burn very
rapidly throughout the whole area filled by the gas.

The result is a spectacular internal explosion. Bad news.

I base this theory on a typical school experiment, the exploding can. You
feed gas from the gas tap in the bottom, light the excess at the top. It
burns gently at the top, but gradually the gas mix chanmges inside until it
reaches an explosive mixture. The detachable (but firmly closed) lid of the
can then travels straight up several feet - and this from a volume of a
couple of liters. Such an explosion might not puncture heavy bulkheads but
it\'s certainlty bad news for interior walls, systems, personnel etc.
That\'s my theory, anyway. I\'d bet there\'s a hydrogen-lead warning system to
allow the crew to do something about this.

	You know, you could try adding a one-shot derringer-style
grenade-launcher, a gyroscopic compensator, electronic sights, and a laser
pointer...  It might just get that recoil down into the realm of sanity,
and boy would the cricket look cool; "Noisy Cricket on steroids and bad
acid" :).

	Makes sense to me...  Although I tend to use them as a reality
check in the design stage.  If a pistol goes over say 6 recoil, it\'s time
to start hanging accessories off it :).

	Well, actually, Robert A. Heinlein was one of the most influential
SF writers ever.  I\'d rank him right up there with Clarke and Asimov.  He
had a very libertarian view of things, and his work was heavily influenced
(IMHO) by the fact that he got invalided out of the U.S. Navy early on in
WWII.  This led him to take a somewhat (IMHO and YMMV) idealized view of
things military in his writing.  I get the feeling that he never quite got
over it.

	This is most pronounced in Starship Troopers, which is a highly
entertaining read, if you don\'t mind feeling like you\'re reading a
recruiting tract :).  It\'s a case in point of how much influence Heinlein
had on the SF genre; it\'s where he invented powered armour.  Trav
Battledress was directly inspired by this book.  There are several
wonderful scenes of guys in powered suits causing truly insane mayhem in it.

	Interestingly, ST is also highly revered by some because of the
"philosophy" it espouses.  I\'m almost tempted to say that Heinlein must
have been pulling a critical thinking test on his readership with that.
Suffice to say that the political system in the book could very well be
characterized as fascist (and in fact has, by some); personally I wouldn\'t
go quite that far, but I have major, major problems with it personally.

	ST is currently being made into a movie, slated for release Nov. 7
in the States.  It\'s caused howls of anguish, due to the fact that the
makers abandoned the powered armour concept in favour of uniforms that look
a Nazi spin on the ones in Aliens.  As well, the fact that the film was
directed by Verhoeven (sp?) the guy who did Robocop and Showgirls, and
whose idea of subtlety was described by someone as "In a scene where a
character gets shot in the head, only have the people onscreen get
splattered with brains"; basically, a lot of fans are worried that the
aforementioned philosophical component of the novel will get badly mangled.

	Personally, from what I\'ve seen on Sony\'s website, while the action
sequences look like something out of Beau Geste meets the Aliens, they\'ve
managed to put a pretty good spin on the social and political feel of the
book.  I suspect that the movie will be a big, dumb violent Bug Hunt, with
the more authoritarian elements of the philosophical component getting a
lot of attention...

	But honestly, run, do not walk, to your local SF bookstore and try
and find _anything_ by Heinlein.  The vast majority of his stuff is really
good SF.  I find that even his early, "juvenile" novels are still very
readable.

If you\'re interested in Traveller then you should pick up Poul Anderson,
especially the Dominic Flandry and Nicholas Van Rijn books. The Traveller
universe is very similar to the above books especially regarding how
nobles/bureocrats/navy works. A good source for Vargr is "Hunters of the

A scout ship is 2G, right enough, but you\'re not going to suggest that any
sane pirate would use a scout ship, are you. Though I suppose a pack of
them could be dangerous...

Anyway, you are right in suggesting that such ships must be added to a ship
registration file, but you are so far off in your estimates that you simply
can\'t be serious. Let me know if you actually want a detailed refutation.
For the moment I\'ll just touch the high spots.

If the auxiliary craft comes from out of system then it has been brought
by a parent ship that is listed in the file. If it comes from in system
then it will be registred locally.

Couriers could run into quite a few ships, I admit, though you\'re going to

Oh, I\'ll grant you a factor 10 increase if you like. Now you need the
data storage of 7,500 PCs....

Captain. Crew will propably just be listed in the ship\'s log. Which will
be difficult, but not impossible to tamper with. Anyway, I started by
allocating 10 K to each entry. You can pack quite a lot of information
into 10 K, so before you start to increase the SRF on that basis, you
have to fill up those 10 K.

>Do we include interface shipping (ships from out of the Empire?)

It makes little difference. Ships from out of the Imperium would recieve
a thorough examination in any case. Propably they\'ll get a temporary
registration.

If the space between the inner and outer can be depressurized on warships
and the pipings etc are nonessential to combat then the ship would gain
quite a lot of effective armour. When a warhead (KE) or laserblast hits the
outer shell the blast will radiate inwards as a cone of molten/gaseous
metal that will rapidly diminish in penetrative/damaging ability. This was
used on the european space probe that went to Halley so protect from
micrometeorites coming from the comet.

This could be a Star Wars handwave for those solar panel looking wings on

This would be true if there were no other use for the ships than to suppress
pirates. But these ship are not bought (primarily) to suppress pirates. They
are bought to fight wars and to support the ships that fight wars. And those
ships last a long time. The regular navy seem to keep their ships for about
50 years after which the ships are turned over to the colonial navies, who
get another half century of use out of them.

I suppose that if an empire have had neither wars nor the threat of war nor
piracy for a century then you might see a lessening in its fleet strength.
But don\'t forget that ships in ordinary lasts a lot longer than a 100 years.
 
>If there were no pirates, the funding of piracy suppression missions
>would be used by much needed other government programs.=20

In areas with no pirates piracy suppression missions are simply fleet
training missions.

Lensman seems kind of wierd when you read it, but reading it is,
in my mind, probably like reading the first murder mystery ever 
written. It lacks polish and seems kind of silly in spots, but it is
seminal SF.

Shut up! Shut up!!!! That I cannot believe. The person/people who
wrote Vampire Fleets never read any of Saberhagen\'s stuff? They
are badlife. My decaying-cesium-randomized brain cannot handle this.
I must spend the rest of my existance lumbering from system to system

How come nobody has described why people go mad by looking at 
hyperspace in Niven\'s books? As we see in a parallel thread, some
people may have (somehow) missed reading their Niven. (Think of it like
"eating your vegetables", except a lot more enjoyable).

When you go into Niven\'s hyperspace, windows looking outside
disappear. It\'s like a blindspot. Everything else just curves around
and the window is gone. Which can be more than a tad mind-bending
for a lot of folks.

Wasn\'t it Louis Wu who was forced to go into hyperspace with
the ship\'s hull completely transparent? The only visible object,
the mass detector, stretched, wrapped around and consumed his
entire 4pi steradians of view. Iiiiieeeeeee.

How about traffic created by the Space Liners to and from "new" vacation
spots within the system... Im pretty sure people are going to go on a 1-2
week excursion to the asteroid belt or a ringed gas-giant if not else just
for the romance it will portray - similar to our ocean liners now...
 
How about private belters who search for there lucky find in the belts...?
It would be similar to the gold rush - unstoppable, but highly profitable
for the belter if they get lucky...

Even at war a SDB should always be defending the system the reside in ...

Even if this was an issue - My current campaign involves the Imperium at
war with one or two of its neighbors - this places the naval resources at
the front and not all available to patrol interior aspects of the
Empire... This leaves avenues for pirates to operate more effectively...

Why would the transponder be difficult to forge? Maybe unaccessable but a
ship equipped with modern "tl" workshops and electronic workshops should
be rather easy to forge or change a transponder - what the transponder is
made from some "special" device - even with some sort of safty lock it
could eventually be broken by someone who has the time...

I would tend to agree with most people here that starships would most

As your eyes can only see 2D stuff what you see is a 2d projection of a 3d
projection of a 4d thing but thats a nitpick. Why does anybody think that
there\'s somthing we humans will go mad by looking at? We can generate more
or less anything with any geometry on a computer screen and I don\'t see
people going mad after looking at abstract computer stuff (well looking at
one too many Techno video while on a mix of alcohol, uppers, downers, glue,
extacy then perhaps...).

BTW Why should jumpspace be 4D? The real world is as we all know a 3d
projection of a 4d thing. We just cannot seem to "see" the 4:th dimension.

Weird, reminds me of the "Urban Assault Weapon" or such in Beverly Hill\'s

that\'s Accessorizing! :)

Mind you, it wouldn\'t look very much like a pistol anymore.  I could reduce 
energy to sane levels, but then it would be less effective than a laser or 
regular sidearm.

<Sigh>

Someone else suggested making it a mine.  That would be one hell of a 
"Bouncing Betty"! Using the recoil as a from of propulsion and turning the 
pistol into an explosive or KE penetrator.

Maybe if it was placed as a backup weapon to Battledress, or placed inside a 
shock absorbing cybernetic arm....

Be Afraid....
Be VERY afraid!

Have to agree as well on these two.. but there was a great scene in
"Gripping Hand" where two of the characters were on Sparta, looking at the
Imperial Palace, and talking about how easy it would be for someone to lob
a nuke at it, when the notice that everyone around them is giving them very
hard looks...

That sounded just too much like most of my Traveller games, so it stuck
with me.

Add in the costs of taking care of the dependants and pensions, recruiting
costs, subsidizing the Naval Academies, all those mid and high passages

Not to mention the cost of the Naval bureaucracy itself!

Ok, my original purpose was to supply some more ammo to the
pro-piracy camp, and I have no problems conceding that what I
stated is not a "proof" in any formal sense.

The Piracy Thread (which I\'ve collected) is getting near the megabyte
in volume. It spawned many interesting subthemes, but I think we can
basically sum up the arguments as follows:

Pro Piracy
- ----
A) It exists in canonical sources, and seems to be quite common
(armed starships, pirate career, encounter tables, ""various
published adventures).

B) Many of the counterproofs, even if more "realistic" would remove a
lot of adventuring possibilities (realistic sensors, ship registers).
{Even if apparently spurious, this second argument is quite strong,
 IMHO, considering we are talking about a RPG. Many people in the past
 pointed out that gravitics+fusion would probably remove the need for
 conventional mining, the TL differences are implausible and so on...}

Against Piracy
- ----
A) Very difficult to do (again, this is mostly due to sensors and how
the various weapons work).

B) Not very profitable, considering that you can always sell the ship
and retire, instead of risking life and limb as a pirate. {This is
quite difficult to dispute, perhaps pirates mental faculties declined
after having looked at the Jumpspace...}

C) Trivially easy to stamp out. This is a by-product of (A)+(B): with
realistic sensors hiding becomes difficult, and the cost of military
ships is too low compared to the cost of civilian ones, so it becomes
really easy to justify anti-piracy deployment.


I\'m considering this as a GM. It is much easier (for me) to decide
that military starships cost much more than civilian ones, and
therefore they are much scarcer than what suggested by Hans\'
analysis. If I had to run a PE (or other high level) game, I could be
forced to change my assumptions.
PC\'s usually deal in civilian starships, so they shouldn\'t be too
concerned about military budgets.

So, in case you are still tallying votes on the issue, I say that
Piracy exists and continues to be a threat for the Imperium. I
resolve the discrepancy by multiplying costs for military ships by a
factor of 10 or more, because it is less damaging for my style of
play then eliminating piracy.

Here is what I\'ve decided to do:

1) Multiply military equipment costs by 15. 

2) The strict rulings about identifying your ship and close control by
spaceport authorities and SDB patrols will be effectively enforced
only in systems were a Navy base is present.

3) About sensors, I\'ll probably stick with (admittedly unrealistic) CT
ranges and justify this with various handwaves.

This is all IMTU/IMHO, obviously, and I\'m not implying that the
anti-piracy party is wrong (quite the contrary, in fact); what I\'m
trying to say is that if you want to run an high level campaign (were
players deal with planet sized budgets) you should probably consider
PE, HG and other similar sources as more "canonical", while for
individual-level campaign I strongly suggest going for less
realistic/consistent interpretations. This is a pity, but I think
that we will have to just live with it: I can\'t think of anything all large
work of fiction (Star Trek, Star Wars, Traveller...) do suffer from
internal consistency problems 

To sum it up: the anti-piracy issues are quite valid, and I\'m
convinced that the discrepancy exist. I don\'t intend to dispute your
points; I deliberately decide to ignore them for dramatic purposes. 

I thank everybody who pointed this out (especially Hans) and all the
people who took part in the discussion: without your insight, this
problem would probably have manifested right in the middle of an
adventure (as it usual happens when consistency is involved...)

The current issue of Naval Institute\'s Proceedings has a very interesting
story about using orbital kinetic-kill weapons as weapons against surface
ships.  The article gives a very good description of the orbital and
targetting dynamics involved, and gives a great description of the effects
of using one of the old 16" guns from the Iowa-class battleships as an
orbital weapon system.

This would be a slightly different approach than the old THOR flying
crowbar system that was propopsed back in the late 70s.  The THOR system
was similar to the MLRS in concept; blanket an area with numerous hits from
smaller weapons to wipe out a target.  The magazine article proposes a
single, larger device that would deliver a devastating punch, or that could
"calve" into multiple smaller weapons.

A little something to annoy those pesky Battle Dress PCs when they are
trying to seize control of a TL8 planet.

Great story about these two...

At the 1976 Nebula awards, Heinlein was to be award the first Grand Master
award.  Also present was Joe Haldeman, whose "Forever War had just won the
Hugo for Best Novel, and was nominated for a Nebula.  Everyone was waiting
for Heinlein to rip into Haldeman for ripping off Starship Troopers and
writing a very anti-war book (for those who do not know, Joe Haldeman is
Vietnam vet who was wounded several times).

Heinlein shows up, and is moving down the reception line with Jim Baen, who
is introducing many of the younger writers.

Baen: "and this is Joe Haldeman, author of.."
Heinlein: "..the Forever War!" he steps forward and begins pumping Joe\'s
hand vigorously, "Wonderful book, best military science fiction I\'ve *ever*
read!"

Haldeman swears his feet didn\'t touch ground for weeks afterwards..

We are not talking about a computer that has the data storage of 7,500
PCs, we are talking about a _single_database_ that requires (this is
your number, not mine) 7.5 Terabytes of storage.  (7500 GB = 7.5 TB)

Again, a .1% change rate (ridiculously low) puts 7.5 GB of change data
in process at any given time.  Any single hacker who manages to access
the database can insert add/remove/change data that will propogate
faster than it can be corrected, assuming that it is detected.

Finally, why would a cruiser squadron in Glimmern Deep need Corridor
ship data?

Keep the information local, and updated locally.  It makes more sense.

This would be true if there were no other use for the ships than to suppress

The operation of naval vessels in this century, in the defense mode, occur
in regions that do not interfere significantly with merchant traffic.
Maneouvres occur in the mid ocean away from prying eyes, or blatantly just
off an agressors coast in order to impress on that countries ruling powers.
This is the case during peacetime. I accept that a war-footing is different.

Given the vastness of space and the constant training for warfare with which
the IN is occupied, would not the same be true? This implies that the ships
allocated to piracy suppression are essentially the only ones on the job.
The others are on maneouves, or "at the front" or at strategic posts, or
providing a backdrop to some noble\'s birthday party or wherever. They are
otherwise busy elsewhere is my point.

The argument that all military activity is funded and thus allocated duty
accordingly forces the argument. If there is a threat, the threat is dealt
with within the budget constraints. If there is no threat, the allocations
go elsewhere.

Even with the most liberal use of the numbers, there is not an infinity of
ships. This means they are allocated as required by people making value
judgements with all the fallibility that that entails. If a fleet commander
decides he needs his armada to suppress piracy, then locally there will be a
vastly reduced incident of piracy. Any that does occur will definately be
enacted with guile and intelligence rather than "swashbuckling". The
commander will have to continually justify the use of these deployments to
his paymasters. They will accept as long as they percieve a plus on the
cost-benefit analysis. After that the ships are assigned to escort duty,
entertainment duty, "air show" duty, front-line duty or some other "more
important" duty.

All this is true even with thousands of ships per subsector. Someone
somewhere decided there deployment on the basis of their perceptions of the
fleet requirements. And remember, their perceptions are probably more
corruptable than anyone else.

Comments and suggestions are requested!

The players escaped imminent doom by hijacking an
Arkesh Secure Trader (200t, 2 laser batteries).
It\'s got some internal wall damage, especially 
to the bridge (door blown open).

They are in the Vilis subsector of the Spinward
Marches, ca. year 1020.

They want to sell this ship which is not theirs.
They plan to forge ship\'s papers (which is fine
by me, if they can find the forms and people to
bribe).  In the lead archaeologist\'s own words, 
here\'s the options they\'re thinking about:

- ----

Jump to Quare, sell/trade ship for a jump-2 (or better 
jump-3) ship.  (Perhaps just sell it, and purchase a new 
ship at Frenzie.  Anyone able to tell me anything about 
the Federation of Arden worlds?)

Alternatives:

1. Sell the ship in Frenzie, hoping the Navy/starport 
   authorities don\'t care that the paperwork may be forged, 
   since it\'s an Arkesh ship.

2. Try to sell the ship in Hrunting or Mjolnir, or the Sword 
   Worlds.  (Anyone able to tell me anything about the Sword 
   Worlds?)  This would require travel through Villis, which 
   Smudge want\'s to avoid at all costs, due to the possibility 
   of Darrian technology being at Villis and being able to 
   revive the Baron.

- ----

Oh yes, a minor noble in the group killed a Regina Baron,
and wants him to remain dead (he\'s only mostly dead?).
This caused a bit of upset in the group.

Well, FF&S specifically states on page 78 that the same G compensators that
eliminate inertial effects also provide environmental gravity. Also the
SSDS shows "artificial gravity/inertial compensators" as single units. Even
if you assume G comp can\'t push a container, you have postulated a new
"artificial gravity" effect that can. Why not use artificial gravity to
push the container out the door?

Moreover, there are no rules for separate artificial gravity generators.
This situation leads to referees making mistakes and players abusing the
rules. I think I am much safer declaring that G comp must both reduce
inertial and provide artificial gravity.

Whether one can push with G comp or artificial gravity, we still need a
reason why it isn\'t used to move cargo.

First of all, my ship\'s decks are perpendicular to the thrust axis (think
of a building with the engines in the basement). The players wanted to
maneuver the nose of the ship against the derelict, so the compensators
were already pointing at it. Crewmembers on the top deck are held in place
by the G compensators, so why not the derelict\'s hull, which was
effectively on the ceiling of the top deck. Glenn\'s answer explains why it
wouldn\'t work; the artificial gravity ends at the ceiling.

Secondly, if one could simply remount the grav compensators and point them
out the ship to affect outside objects, this would effectively give you
tractor/pressor beams at TL 10. This is so useful it would be a standard
fixture of cargo ships. Glenn\'s answer explains this one too; since you
need both a floor and ceiling the only way this would work is if you built
a hold or deck large enough to contain the entire derelict inside.

I said before that making artificial gravity not follow the rule for G
compensation will lead to mistakes in the game. I think this is an example.
Where do the "6Gs" come from? If it\'s just pulled out of thin air why not
60 Gs or 6000? If you can provide so many Gs of artificial gravity, why not
mount A-grav plates on the ceiling, engines on the floor, and safely
accelerate your ship to 6 Gs as well? If there are no rules for this kind
of thing a referee can make any ruling he wants and regret it later.

In my campaign a G compensator can damp inertial or provide artificial
gravity interchangeably. So if you have a 3 G compensator you can
counteract up to 3 Gs of acceleration or provide up to 3 Gs of artificial
gravity, but not both. And cranking the ship\'s gravity to 3 Gs leaves you
with no inertia compensation. This provides rules for the referee to make
decisions in and means the players actually have to consider the effects of
their actions.

These two books explore a different side of sci-fi...instead of the
traditional aliens race arrives from outer space and has to decide wether or
not to allow humans into space, the situation is reversed.  The humans have
the first contact, and must make the decision, on some very scanty info.
 Excellent books, and the idea of the human empire in them (the Empire of
Man) is one of the best I have seen.

  Highly variable. DA6 (?), Divine Intervention, has a society without
the TL to support a floating palace supported by angels, but the same
imported hardware would provide point defense for their jump limit.

  Depends on whether their support is at the homeworld, or whether ships
deliver relief crews every 3 or 6 months (or whatever).

  I\'d suggest 5% is too high as an average, but the loading of virtually
every expense except welfare for unwed fathers onto that budget seems 
hard to justify given the nature of the IN\'s hardware.

  Very good question. IN likely has first call on construction capacity.
If retrofitting is easy, we return to the "patchwork ship" with imported
TL 9 components where possible (at least in HG).

>7) How corruptable are starport officials?  (Both STC and shipyard)

  Refs fiat. If the local authorities shoot corrupt officials who are
otherwise well-paid...  And is there a camera or recorder in your office?

  Again, a ref with a 1984 frame of mind can make it very nearly literally 
impossible. Your "tamper-proof" black box indicates that your transponder
wasn\'t sending? Die-traitor!. IMO, rather extreme. But effective registration
and enforcement must exist, otherwise anyone can simply skip on their payments.
One problem is that some piracy posts assume that any effective limitation
on such activities is highly improbable at best.

>Market for ships appears to be somewhat limited.  10-20% value (more if you 
                                                    ^^^    
  At least, IMO. With patience, you\'ll get it to sale. Not strictly valid
deep within (more than a few sub-sectors) the Imperium.

  I\'d like to use them, but will a Type S and a Type R have a large commonality
of parts? Not hull plates, OC, but electronics modules, drive componenents, etc?

 N+1) What is the rough performance envelope for the most common pirate vessel?
Drives, fuel, cargo, weapons, firecon/sensors (if applicable), etc. Where is
it from?

Nice list. Now, how would people here narrow it down to a Top-10 list. You
know. Ten authors you think ALL SF readers or new devotees should be
familiar with? The ten most ESSENTIAL authors on this list (not necessarily
as far as Traveller is concerned, although perhaps that would make another
good Top-10 list...)


My ten would be:

Asimov, Issac
Bradbury, Ray
Clarke, Arthur C
Dick, Philip
Heinlein, Robert Anson
Herbert, Frank
LeGuin, Ursula
Niven, Larry
Silverberg, Robert
Vonnegut, Kurt

        While I have nothing but my thoroughly unenjoyable 4 years
        as a member of Uncle Sugar\'s military establishment to use
        as evidence, I doubt that there is any single governmental
        group in this country that could provide an accurate record
        of the location and ownership of all the cars in this 
        country. I doubt that you could find such a group for
        just the "first-owner" cars much less the millions of used
        cars in this country. The city I live in can\'t even discover
        the identities of the owners of the abandoned cars that are
        left on the streets. I doubt that an empire with a standard
        crossing time of better than a year could even keep track
        of the locally owned stuff.

I was attempting to create a baseline of traffic for a system.  Of
course local variables (outside the norm) should be administered by the
GM according to his specific campaign.

SDBs are unable to leave their system, essentially trapped.  If an
invasion force has accurate intelligence on the numbers and disposition
of the SDB force, it can not only determine the correct invasion
strength, but also will be able to determine the strength of the
occupation force that will be required after the system is suppressed.

If SDBs are routinely used in anti-piracy/customs patrols, then the
opportunity to gather that intelligence abounds.

If the entire force is not used, what percentage is needed to maintain
an adequate A/piracy presence?  There have been a number of claims that
a single SDB can supress piracy for a single world.  If that is done,
are we rotating crews?  What is the schedule?  When is maintenance
performed?  If more than one is used, what is the patrol schedule?  If a
Signal GK is received, does the off-duty SDB scramble to cover the ready
position?  If a Signal GK is received outside the 100 D limit, does the
planetary SDB respond, or is there a separate command structure for
interplanetary space.

Finally, is this a unified command, or is it fragmented.  And is a
single model applied to all worlds, or does each system have it\'s own
structure?

This does not even touch on the deployment of SDBs to systems that can
not support them.  (And which I vehemently disagree with)

If you accept the MT version of a transponder, they are impossible to
duplicate.  Otherwise, they are merely difficult.
However, as a transponder check would be part of an Imperial \'Health and
Welfare\' naval inspection, it is in your best interests not to have
touched the box...

I\'m not sure I understand your position.  Are you for or against
standardization?

        To back up this point, several years ago a representative to the State\'s
        Legislature for the great state of Indiana (USA) discovered that his
        son was having some difficulty with his study of plane geometry. After
        discussing the material with his son the legislator (who shall remain
        nameless) introduced a resolution to the main body of the legislature to 
        set the value of pi at 3.00 so that it would be easier for school children
        to remember -- the resolution was not passed but was seconded and apparently
        received some general support before the debate on its merits.

OTOH, if it is impossible, then canon that sometimes people skip
out on ship payments would be impossible (as would being any sort
of fugitive fleeing from planet to planet).  In fact  The problem
is that you are in an "either/or" analysis where you are considering
that if it is possible, it is "easy" (as opposed to impossible).
What is most likely is that there is that there is some chance
of getting caught, and high profile crimes have more chance of
getting caught (which is common, if you rob Fort Knox they are
going to pay a lot more attention than if you rob a 7-11)

Not on topic but certain theories now maintain that the hydrogen in
the Hindenburg didn\'t burn, the covering of the ship did.  The major
point of this rationale is that hydrogen burns with a bluish flame and
the flames from the airship were definately yellow/orange (not my
theory, comes from an issue of Smithsonian\'s Air and Space last year).

To all of those who missed B5 last night...you really missed out.

This episode really could have been the end of the series.  I really
don\'t know where they\'re going from here.  Everything is tied up, and
they\'ve got a whole season yet to do.

An Alliance made from the League of Non-Alligned Worlds...
Sheridan retires from EarthForce...
Sheridan accepts Presidency of the Alliance...
Sheridan and D\'Lenn marry...
Garibaldi marries...
Ivanova is promoted to Captain...
Marcus is dead...
Londo and G\'Kar are friends...
The Rangers become a Star Fleet like force...

Good God!  What an episode!

Next week, (and this will be last time B5 is on network TV, going to TNT
for the 5th season in January) I understand that we are going to be
looking at the future.

There\'s a great set-up there for the spin-off series.

I\'ve said it before, and I\'ll say it again, B5 is the best series I\'ve
every seen on TV.

This is a poor summary.  The fact is that a numnber of us _don\'t_
consider the "proofs" that piracy wouldn\'t exist to be more
realistic, or even realistic at all.  I personally find to
be too simplistic to have any predictive power and, if
the same approach is applied to real world situations, you
can come up with clear mistakes.  They are also based on a
number of assumptions that, it can be argued, are either
flawed or are arbitrary.

the middle of an English town preparing for war with France.  The ship opens 
and a blue "daemon" appears and fires a laser at an archer.  Bad move.  The 
rest of the Archers fire all on the one "daemon" killing it.  Now that they 
know that the daemons" can be killed the English army storms the ship and 
takes it over.  From there the Baron loads the entire barony on board in an 
attempt to raid France, but the one \'Daemon" (later called a Wesgorix) sets 
the navcontrols to an outpost of his own empire, leaving the primitive 
humans lost in space.  This is just the beginning of the adventure!

I read this when I was playing TNE and thought of what would happen if a 
Merchant ship did the wrong thing on a TL-0/1 world.  Also I thought of what 
would have happened to Vilani Traders who came to Earth back in the 12th 
century! :-)

What really stood in my mind was when the Mideavals discovered the power of 
tactical nukes thrown from a Trebuchet!  Now that\'s SCARY!

Reminds me of some Trav games in where primitives were picked up and became 
part of the crew.  A Barbarian with a big sword from a high grav world as 
security officer is quite a sight!

"I am AH-nold, you Vill not enter this ship!"

Anyway, read High Crusade.  Very amusing tale.

According to the website, the third is either out now or soon will be.

That\'s the US title for \'The Moat Around Murchesson\'s Eye\'? I didn\'t think 
it was that bad. It had two very nice (and very Traveller, IMHO) bits - 
the rather unsubtle threat at the start, and the \'we\'re carrying *what* in 
the hold?!\' bit.

This is great stuff!  Excellent work.  Was TRTOOLS 0.95 used to downgrade 
the UPP Data?

I was thinking some of us gearheaded oriented individuals (such as myself) 
could get together to produce some Starships, weapons, equipment and such 
for the Polities in the Sol Rim.  From what I can see, most hi-tech worlds 
are TL-12.  I am assuming that there is no fusion plus available tho.

This weekend I am going to plug this data into my copy of Gal2.1  Should be 
interesting.

Thanx, and keep up the good work!

Hmmm i was assuming this would be a norm not outside the norm - but i
guess i could be wrong - I always envisioned multiple worlds colonized
within a single system - so there would be traffic to and from these
planets...

Hmmm, i would if possible as a pirate set off multiple Signal GK\'s just to
cause confusion with the SDB trying to determine which is real and which
is false...

I still believe there is no such thing as impossible given the time... but
alas the health and welfare would always discourage it unless of course
you knew how to seal one back to its original seal... hmmm, i guess old
naval inspectors never retire they are just shot in the head somewhere,
hope he gets a good severance plan... or else I would be using that
knowledge to circumvent the transponders...

Im for it... I truely can not believe the various compaines would not try

You know, actually I\'ve been gnawing on this post all day today.  I
finally realized what it is about it that bothered me.

THE DRAFT.  Involuntary conscription.  Mandatory service, or at least
mandatory employment.

If you don\'t have a job by the time you are 18 (unless you recieve a
college deferment) - the boys in black come and escort you to your
friendly neighborhood recruiting station.

Perhaps, just perhaps, my initial numbers were not that far off after
all.

Yes, I think he did. 

Let me rephrase his question, "Is there any reason that a random character
generation system couldn\'t be developed and used with CORPS? Further, is
there some reason a career-system couldn\'t be used with CORPS?"

I don\'t see why you couldn\'t, but I\'ll defer to the CORPS Corps for the
definitive answer. ;->

BTW, you can pick up the free "Nutshell" version of CORPS from BTRC\'s web
site.  Sorry don\'t remember the URL, but some kind person will post it, I\'m
sure.  If you can\'t wait for that post, I *know* you can link to BTRC\'s
site from Hyperbooks (www.hyperbooks.com), because that\'s how I got there. 
;->

The Nutshell version of CORPS has a lot of good ideas (I\'d expect that from
a Greg Porter product), but there were some things that bothered me.  For
example, the Task System seems to be pretty convoluted.  I quote...

 "Your skill level in CORPS is compared to the adjusted Difficulty of
 the task being performed.  If the skill is >= Difficulty, you succeed.
 If not, you roll 1d10 to check for success.  You succeed if you roll an
 11 or less, *minus 2 for each point of difference* between your skill
 and the Difficulty.
 
 Example -- If your skill is 4 and the Difficulty is 6, you need an 11,
 minus 4 for the difference of 2 points, or a 7 or less."

....Now, this might be intuitive after you do it for a while, but it seems
darn complicated to me.  Sure, if the difficulty level is <= your skill you
don\'t even have to roll, but if you do have to roll then you have to:

 (1) calculate the difference in your Skill and the Difficulty --
     subtraction
     
 (2) multiply the difference by 2 -- multiplication
 
 (3) subtract the multiplied difference from 11 -- subtraction again
 
 (4) compare it to a roll on a 1d10 -- a die roll and a comparison

To me, that seems much *too* complicated..easy enough to do, but more steps
than I like.  But maybe that\'s just me.

OTOH, I really like some of the ideas in CORPS.  Greg tries to get
"aptitudes" into the chargen process (if you\'ve been around TML for any
length of time you know how I feel about skill aptitudes ;-) in a simple
way.  His idea of Skill Trees with Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary skills
is a good one.  Greg handles combat, damage, armor, and weapons with a good
bit of detail, and (as I would expect) well:  lethal and non-lethal damage,
dual level armor, and using 3G3 almost directly for ranged weapons.  I
liked what I saw enough to order a copy, which I haven\'t recieved yet.

I really don\'t think I\'ll convert, the skill system bugs me too much, but
I\'ll probably steal some ideas from CORPS...just like I have from FUDGE,
Aftermath, and ever other rpg system I run across.  ;->

Here\'s a request to the CORPS Corp on TML..If you have developed Skill
Trees for Traveller, specific chargen procedures, and/or other ways to
interface the CORP System with the TNE/T4 systems I\'d *love* to see them.
Would you post them, either on TML or directly to me?

Thanks.

I\'ve missed a few and misnamed Harry Turtledove, but I\'m updating my list
based on everybody\'s posts.  After a few days, I\'ll repost the updated
list.

That\'s a good idea for a thread. Anybody want to keep score and rank SF
authors based on the number of top 10 votes? ;->

The top 10 SF authors for Traveller would be another good list, strong
overlap in my case, but not nessecarily for everybody.

Shoot, I missed Kurt Vonnegut! OK, he\'s one the list.  Frankly, I consider
him more "mainstream" than SF, but that\'s just me. ;->

To tell you the truth, I don\'t remember. ;-) Could have something to do
with ease of flight in an atmosphere, or ease of loading/unloading of
cargo. Maybe it\'s more expensive to have many "floors" in the ship?
That\'s a lot of grav plates... ;->

Inertial compensation is *not* an "artificial gravity" effect. (IMHO)

Inertial compensators only *cancel* _inertial_ forces. It doesn\'t
generate an opposite gravitational force to cancel it. It\'s just
"magically" gone. Inertial forces are distinct from gravitational
forces.

Making a high speed turn in a jet doesn\'t actually generate gravity, it
is a result of the inertia of your body sitting in the chair. The
"G-Force" unit ("pulling 3Gs" etc..) is just a measure of this inertial
force against that of the gravitational force.

That\'s \'cuz you *always* want inertial compensators with artifical
gravity. Or you could say the compensators are a by-product of the
operation of the artifical gravity generators, so you might as well take
advantage of the effect.

Just as electricity generates a magnetic field, artificial gravity
generates an inertial dampening field.

Here\'s my reasoning:

- - You need two plates to generate a gravitational field between them.
- - The direction of the gravitational force is *always* perpendicular to
the plates.
(no pushing/pulling sideways, unless you pivot the floor and ceiling :->
)
- - A byproduct of the generation of this artificial gravity is an
inertial dampening field.
- - The "strength" of the inertial dampening field is independent of the
strength of the gravity field. The magnitude/direction of the artifical
gravity can be adjusted without affecting the ability of the inertial
compensators to compensate for inertial forces.
- - At higher tech levels, modulation of the artificial gravity field
allows one to increase the amount of g-forces that can be compensated by
the inertial dampening effect.

But that\'s not the way it works according to FF&S. There is a maximum
amount of force Inertial compensators can counteract, independent of the
setting of the gravity field.

A little rant:

Thanks for making me think about these things. You\'ve brought up some
very interesting questions, that I don\'t believe have been thouroughly
thought out in the rules. There\'s a sort of mishmash of many different
gravity manipulators which seem to make differing assumptions about how
gravity works:

Thruster Plates
Grav Drives
Artificial Gravity/Inertial Compensation
Tractor Beams/Repusors

They also have different powers and effects. I guess different
limitations were wanted for each application of artificial gravity, as
each was added to the game arbitrary limits were placed on them. It sure
would be nice to have a TL-15 _Applied Gravitational Physics_ Textbook
to refer to.

Hey! That\'s a good idea... I should get started on it...

Haven\'t been following the Hugos, have we.. Connie is one of the hottest

books and short stories are great and often very funny.  Check out "The
Doomsday Book", which is absolutely the best time-travel novel I\'ve ever read.

John Barnes did "A Million Open Doors" (which I steal shamelessly from),
along with an interesting alternate history series (Patton\'s spaceship,
Washington\'s Dirigible, and one other)

But *Steve* Barnes... Sensei Steve has been known to throw me across the
room as a greeting.  The man is a human dynamo.  He\'s a master of about ten
martial arts and reaches Tai-Chi at conventions.  He\'s promised to kill me
in an upcoming book, continuing my desire to appear dead in more novels
than any other fan in history.  (I\'m already in one..)

That\'s Niven and Pournelle in collaboration, and it is excellent.  Our

Gordon Dickson\'s Dorsai books, and the Hammer\'s Slammers books (who

Philosophical component?  In a Verhoeven film?  It\'s hard to type while

It\'s just a coincidence that the movie and the book have the same name,

This is actually a pretty good perspective.  In order to maintain
internal order, the Imperium needs a big navy.  It can\'t justify a big
navy (and the taxes to pay for it) by telling that truth.  It can\'t
justify a big navy by pointing to external threats -- the various
external powers just aren\'t enough of a threat, and won\'t be perceived
as enough of a threat, to the interior of the Imperium.  The interior,
of course, is where the richest, most mature economies are, and where
the real threats to the throne can be found, but the population won\'t
accept the Emperor saying, I need to tax you to buy weapons to protect
myself from you.  Thus were pirates invented, or, if not invented, kept
alive over time.

Adventure hook:  Pirates operating in a certain sector are actually
Imperial agents, acting in collusion with Imperial Naval Intelligence to
(1) injure the economy of a dangerous noble or member state and (2)
generate publicity when the navy finally "catches" them.

That\'s the spirit!  A great and wonderful world (many of them, actually)

> Who is Heinlein, and are there any more authors I ought to know about?

Robert Heinlein wrote some excellent "hard" science fiction starting in
the 1950s.  It\'s been said of him that when he imagines a new world, he
imagines it right down to the shoelaces.
Don\'t miss these:
Have Spacesuit, Will Travel (1959?)
Starship Troopers (I don\'t believe that the movie with the same name has
anything to do with it)
Podkayne of Mars
Friday (a late, decadent, piece of work, but interesting nevertheless)
Stranger in a Strange Land (his best-known work)

Keith Laumer is best known for three universes:  The Bolo stories
concern giant self-aware tanks, and are mostly set in the aftermath of a
vast interstellar war in which the tanks were a major weapon.  The Big
Show is a collection of these stories.  The Retief stories are about an
ace member of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne.  The multiple
universe stories deal with multiple parallel universes running along at
the same time (so that today in our universe is also today in a parallel
universe, except that what\'s happening may be different).

Joe Haldeman wrote The Forever War, a brilliant parody of the Vietnam
War, but excellent as science fiction as well.

Poul Anderson wrote a lot of books set in various stages of a future
history.  The Nicolas Van Rijn stories concern an interstellar merchant
in relatively early times.  The Dominic Flandry stories are about an
agent of the Terran Empire\'s naval intelligence department, very late in
the game for the Empire.  Flandry sees his task as holding off the
inevitable collapse of the Empire, and the galaxy\'s descent into the
Long Night, for the remainder of his own life.  

These should distract you for a few weeks.

three and just write any old trash.

The question we should ask is:

WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIAL SF/TRAVELLER STORIES:

The ones that immediately leap to (my tiny) mind (guess the authors if you
can) are:
Space Viking
But Loyal To His Own
The Man Who Never Missed
Footfall
The Legacy Of Heorot
King David\'s Spaceship
Alien
Dune 
Gateway
Bolo
The Forever War
Starship Troopers
Hammer\'s Slammers: Counting The Cost.
Janissaries

.... there are many others but these are my first thoughts. 
I\'m sure there are many more, but it\'s late.
Any thoughts/recommendations?

Martin.
Here\'s a final thought: Babylon 5. How many of the main characters are
depicted as doing ANYTHING but shooting/fighting in the opening credits?
Not many! So all these \'enlightened\' authors who\'re filling books with
politically-correct mumblings - take note! This is SF! SF is fun! SF is
about testosterone-pumping shootout action with plenty of hand-to-slime
combat. Stuff your meandering plot, EAT HOT PHOTON DEATH (YEAH YEAH)!


HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Huh? Oh, sorry. Ranting again. Too long spent staring into Jspace trying to
figure out if it\'ll drive me mad(der).

	Yeah... that\'s the bummer with lower-TL-high-tech stuff.  At TL-12
regular cpr slugthrowers are still the most efficient in terms of damage,
capacity, and weight.  You can get more damage out of a gauss gun, but at a
sacrifice in either ammo capacity or weight.   Not neccessarily a bad
thing; makes the design process more interesting...

	Naw; just bury it with the muzzle pointed upwards, or securely
attached to some large object, pointed at the triggerring device.  Light,
compact, lethal.  Can you visualize someone stepping on one?  Greasy
flaming bits of deceased poor SOB would be raining all over the place :).

  This presumes that GG\'s are not somewhat out of the way; they also happen
to be where many if not most battles expect to be fought.

  This assumes that piracy suppression is wholly unlike training for anti-
commerce raiding/convoy duty, or that navies don\'t plan such until the war
is underway. 20th C. British experience shouldn\'t be used as a guide here.

  They\'re still sorta strategically tubed, tho. You have to garrison
with warships, and an enemy squadron sortying could cost you control
of the system. The SDB\'s are much cheaper, on a combat strength basis.

  Keeping construction totals secret from the Zho (at least) seems
bloody unlikely. In FFW, SDB\'s were open data (look it up in the
local budget yearbooks for a good idea). SDB\'s lurking in GG\'s and
odd corners serve as guards without necessarily blowing their cover.

  SDB\'s aren\'t IN, IIRC, so the latter, I guess.

  For wartime (only) I\'d suggest that SDB\'s can live off pre-positioned
supplies. No-one with FFW has volunteered data, but I would assume that
only systems with valuable worlds have SDB\'s in peacetime. I agree that
backwater worlds that should still have small freighter traffic will
not normally have SDB\'s, and that these are the worlds where starships
would be stationed or patrol intermittently.

I consider myself fairly well-read in hard SF. I consider  Frank and Dave the
same or more so. I don\'t know if Dave has ever read any of the Berserker

  This is probably best treated solely as a chargen artifact from CT.
Otherwise we have 15 billion citizens directly administered by an
authoritarian Empire, yes? I suspect that piracy can be rubbed out
or converted into a State monopoly in that scenario, _very_ easily.

  I\'d suggest that it\'s possible, but not easy at all. I\'m still
trying to come up with more general cases in which individual acts
of piracy would be do-able (if the province of somewhat desperate
actors). There might also be a problem in that I didn\'t say what
you\'re attributing. Some of the posts have indicated that running
off from system to system with either a stolen cargo or ship is 
trivially easy, due in no small part to the Imperiums inability
or unwillingness to keep useful records.

  Which is relevant to the "national car registry" variant. If
the authorities can figure out where the parts of an airliner
bomb were bought, it might be reasonable to assume that the real
reason for not tracking cars is that they don\'t care, combined
with the insane political cost of the attempt. IE, if they did
much care, they could certainly consider it. Think of how much
data is now available from commercial datanets, without human
operators in most instances.
