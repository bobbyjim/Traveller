What I need to know is what all books are there, how much are they and are

Since I\'m not familiar with all of GDW\'s Traveller products, I thought
it would probably be okay if I forwarded your question to the Traveller
Mailing List.  You\'ll probably get better answers from other listees.

The books I have (or know about) are:

Book 0	(An Introduction to Traveller)
Book 1	Characters and Combat
Book 2	Starships
Book 3	Worlds and adventures
Book 4	Mercenary
Book 5	High Guard
Book 6	Scouts
Book 7	(Merchants?)
Book 8	(Robots?)

Supplement 1	(1001 Characters)
Supplement 2	Animal Encounters
Supplement 4	(Citizens of the Imperium?)
Supplement 6	76 Patrons
Supplement 7	Traders and Gunboats

Adventure 1	(Kinunir?)
Adventure 4	Leviathan
Adventure 7	Broadsword
Double Adventure 5	Horde/The Chamax Plague

High Passage	Issue Number Two (by Fasa)

The Best of the Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society	Volume 1

I also have the MegaTraveller boxed set, and 4 or 5 Challenge magazines.
Unfortunately, I couldn\'t tell you what\'s still in print and what isn\'t.

Well, it happened again.  The automatic list mailer broke down.  I
discovered this because traveller mail has started to flow on
rec.games.frp again, and I was surprised to see many messages were from
listees.  I\'m starting to feel rather frustrated with it and am
considering receiving all traveller mail and processing it by hand.  As
it was, everything mailed in the interim was lost, again!

It was the same problem it was a a year and a half ago; the permission
on the LOG file was wrong, so it was unwriteable by the local mail
delivery system.  I\'ve added even more debugging/message trapping to the
dumb thing to make recovery of lost messages more probable.

I think it all happened when I blew away my account and asked the
operator to restore all those files... the modes must\'ve gotten messed
up.

GROWWLLL!!! Hate these dumb computers! Hate these dumb computers! Hate...

Hi,
  I\'ve been running a Traveller PBM for about 3 months now, and I\'ve noticed
that the Traveller Mailing List is not recieving mail anymore.  Well I was
wondering if the people out there in net land would like to read the adventure
that is going on.  This is just me asking you guys out there, if you would like
to read the moves.  I know the players are enjoying it, and I just thought, 
since I can\'t post to the Traveller List anymore, that you people might want to
have some interesting readings.  Well please respond and tell me what you think
I should do.  Because I wont post if no one wants to read them.  Just wastes
space.

Please do so it is kinda getting tiring out here on netland as there is little 
or no discussion of sfrpg especially traveller/megatraveller which seems to
turn up in most every survey as everyone\'s favorite.
If there are any Megatraveller GM\'s out there I would like to hear from them
on the net as would quite a few other people.
If anyone has an inner line on the new Megatraveller ship rules
1. How do you build an auxiliary bridge?
2. In combat when they are talking about sensor tasks and the first one 
being free. Does that imply both Scan and Pinpoint?
3. Do you have to do separate sensor tasks for every unit out there. Would
make fighter groups brutal if you do especially for ships with small
hull #s because there are only so many turrets to forgo. They\'d all 
burn into visual range and nail your ship with pinpoint criticals.


For those who don\'t know there is another 10 page extra errata sheet for MT
available from GDW or Digest Group for a SASE this is in addition to an
earlier one dated Oct 88.

	My character, Steve Cortland, was in the Imperial Marine for four 
tours of duty.  His father was a successful businessman, and Steve wanted
nothing to do with business...it was too boring a lifestyle for his taste.
So he joined the Marines, a practice not uncommon today.  This was the only
thing that he thought would challenge him.  Four tours later, he retired
with the rank of Force Commander, and a wealth of experience and skills that
being a businessman would never have given him.  I CHOSE to play an ex-mili-
tary type, because I had an idea for a character personality, and wanted to
go with it...

Hi,
  I\'ve been running a Traveller PBM for about 3 months now, and I\'ve noticed
that the Traveller Mailing List is not recieving mail anymore.  Well I was
wondering if the people out there in net land would like to read the adventure
that is going on.  This is just me asking you guys out there, if you would like
to read the moves.  I know the players are enjoying it, and I just thought, 
since I can\'t post to the Traveller List anymore, that you people might want to
have some interesting readings.  Well please respond and tell me what you think
I should do.  Because I wont post if no one wants to read them.  Just wastes
space.

Please do so it is kinda getting tiring out here on netland as there is little 
or no discussion of sfrpg especially traveller/megatraveller which seems to
turn up in most every survey as everyone\'s favorite.
If there are any Megatraveller GM\'s out there I would like to hear from them
on the net as would quite a few other people.
If anyone has an inner line on the new Megatraveller ship rules
1. How do you build an auxiliary bridge?
2. In combat when they are talking about sensor tasks and the first one 
being free. Does that imply both Scan and Pinpoint?
3. Do you have to do separate sensor tasks for every unit out there. Would
make fighter groups brutal if you do especially for ships with small
hull #s because there are only so many turrets to forgo. They\'d all 
burn into visual range and nail your ship with pinpoint criticals.


For those who don\'t know there is another 10 page extra errata sheet for MT
available from GDW or Digest Group for a SASE this is in addition to an
earlier one dated Oct 88.

	My character, Steve Cortland, was in the Imperial Marine for four 
tours of duty.  His father was a successful businessman, and Steve wanted
nothing to do with business...it was too boring a lifestyle for his taste.
So he joined the Marines, a practice not uncommon today.  This was the only
thing that he thought would challenge him.  Four tours later, he retired
with the rank of Force Commander, and a wealth of experience and skills that
being a businessman would never have given him.  I CHOSE to play an ex-mili-
tary type, because I had an idea for a character personality, and wanted to
go with it...

This is my primary problem with GDW\'s conception of Traveller.  Almost
everything they produce is oriented towards the military.  I think
there\'s a lot of SF roleplaying possible with other backgrounds----some
of it might even be violent!

The best thing for Traveller refs was Supplement 4, Citizens of the
Imperium, which had starts for Doctors, Hunters, Scientists, Nobles,
Bureaucrats, Diplomats, and six other non-military types (okay, they
included Pirates and Barbarians as well).  The worst thing for Trav
were Books 4, 5, and etc: Mercenary and High Guard.  Suddenly the
military would have four times the number of skills as other
characters and all of it oriented towards violent action.  No thanks.

As for MegaTraveller, it looked worse all around so I skipped it.

Actually the Scout service was the best place for Samantha to learn her
specialty...flora and fauna of worlds in which humans can survive.  She
is not combat trained...what she does know is from having to deal with
big, dangerous animals and from barroom brawls.
	She would be most upset if you considered her ex-military...
the scouts are civil-service, yes, but she spent the 5th frontier war
helping refugees survive, not killing Zhodani.

	"I thought you were against killing"
	"Well...he was more animal than human anyway..."

Here is Turn #2 in its entirety.  I didn\'t edit it at all.

************************


	First I would like to thank all the players for getting me their
moves on time, and second I would like to tell you all of how I will post
these moves from now on.  There will be 3 sections to these postings, the
first being a note section, in where you all will find any corrections to the
last turn, and anything else that might be of interest.  Second will be the
Passengers move, which plainly is for the passengers.  And the Third section
will be the Crew move.  Now you might have doubts as to why I post both
moves together, and to tell you, it\'s just easier.  Everything I put in these
postings are for general knowledge, and personal moves will go out with these
general moves too.  And now for Turn #2! (Audience applauds, and cheers :-)

MISTAKE:
   I had put down in the first turn that the worlds (LEWIS & ARAMANX) are
in the RHYLANDOR Sub-Sector, well I must have been asleep, because as the
pilot and navigator, and everyone else pointed out, they are in the ARAMIS
Sub-Sector, sorry :-)

****************************************************************************
		Passengers\' Move
****************************************************************************  

	The Captain thanks you all and then leaves through the iris door,
that leads to the stairs.  As soon as the door closes, Robert gets up and 
says to Charlie, "Sorry, but I can\'t play, I\'m really tired and I haven\'t
slept for twenty hours, I really need some sleep."
	"That\'s okay," says Charlie, "I\'ll play with Dan."
	Robert gets up and straightens out his custom made Solomani suit, and
you all notice a bulge underneath his left shoulder, right below the chest, a
perfect location for a shoulder holster.  Because of the size of the bulge,
your guess is that it could be anywhere from a snub pistol to a Derringer-type
pistol, or even a cut-up Auto Pistol.  Moe and Curly just breifly notice, and 
pay no attention otherwise, and they both go back to some serious reading.
Steve notices, but hides his shock as he walks over to the CRT.  Robert walks
down the corridor, and you all hear the door open and close.
	Steve, sits down at the CRT, and begins to punch up the info on the 
Lewis sector. [I will show you all this, since everyone wants to do it, but
I will make refernece to each player spending the time doing so.]


Lewis Subsector Data (Last Update:  1-1109)

Lewis is a penal colony run by both the Imperial Navy and Marine Corps. 
Permission to come within 100 planetary orbits is prohibited, unless proper ID 
is given to the Planetary Radio Operators.  Violation of this is against 
Imperial Law (Sect. XI, A.1), and no responability is lain upon the Empire if
damage occurs.

Sden is a small but habitable planet, located within 50 orbits of the Gas Giant,
in the system.  Researchers found the beginnings of primate evolution evident in
65-798, and have been returning every ten years to follow up on the progress of
the evolution of the planet.  Because of the scientific importance of this
planet, it has been declared off limits to landings, but the Gas Giant is still able to be used as a raw refuelling center.  Scientists have found many of the 
same characteristics of Terra (Solomani Rim), such as the natural resources, 
flora, and fauna, plus the wide range of animals.  The last scientific 
landing on Sden was in 130-1108, and they found the beginnings of a bronze 
working society, though very small, numbering in the 100\'s, it was the pure
beginning of civilization.

....End of Data on Lewis Subsector


	As Steve is busy punching up the data on the CRT, Samantha walks over
to Erc, and says "So you are spending your retirement visiting worlds.  I have 
just spent the last six months in the Regina and Lanth Subsectors cruising
the Spinward Main.  I don\'t know about this area of space ...."              
  	"I really don\'t know much about it either, thanks why I\'m here."
	"Well what I ment to say was that since most of my time in the Service,
I spent it on the Frontier ...."
	"Guarding the liquor I gather," mumbles Erc.
	Continuing without notice, "and I was wondering where you\'ve been? 
What worlds you enjoyed the most, and which you would stay away from."
	"All the red ones my dear," chuckles Erc. "But seriously, I have been
through five of the sixteen subsectors already, they\'ve been:  Glisten, Lunion,
Mora, Lanth, and Rhylandor.  This makes my sixth and there are many worlds 
to watch out for, like Sorel for example ...."

	Samantha and Erc talk until lunch of the many places they have both 
been and many places neither has been, but they would like to go.  Steve starts
playing a Hologame version of Rolling Thunder (for those Video Game lovers)
and plays for about an hour after getting off the CRT.  Moe and Curly use the 
CRT after Steve is done with it, and Charlie and Dan play a total of two games
before the Captain appears and begins lunch service.  Robert misses lunch and
afterwards, the Captain speaks privately with both Samantha and Erc.  Also,
Erekosse is here, he has eaten lunch with the passengers, and has challenged
Steve to a Hologame of his choosing.

	"It is custom on my ship that I invite memeber of the passenger list, 
who have either been a pilot, or might have piloted a starship to join me after
dinner for drinks and conversation in the crew lounge.  Since both of you fit
into this category nicely, I would be honored if you would both join me," says
the Captain to both Samantha and Erc.  "You will also be albe to talk with
Erekosse, since he will be there too."

********************************************************************************
		Crew Move
********************************************************************************

	Captain Moray walks down the stairs, passing through another iris door.
He stops briefly to check the door lock, and enters the cargo bay.  The ceiling
is three meters high, and the cargo crates are stacked neatly.  He pulls a 
liquid crystal clipboard from the wall and begins checking the manifest and the
crates.  He nods as he comes to each group, and checks them off accordingly.
His final check is the crate of clothing that is from the Arter Apparel Corp.
Hmmn, I wonder if this is who Robert works for, he thinks to himself. It might 
just be worth the effort to check up on this company.  He has walked to the
other end of the cargo hold and is standing in front of another door.  He places
the clipboard on the wall next to a comlink, and signals his Navigator that he
has completed his rounds.  He then goes through another iris and goes into the
Engine room to check the purr of his ships\' engines.

	Erekosse Wildantor finishes up the checks on the navigational computer,
and then leans back in his chair, another cargo to run, and more money to
make, he thinks.  This time I think I can\'t blow it on the gambling, I gotta
save some in case we need it for ship parts.  He notices that the CRT in the 
passengers\' common room is requesting info on the Lewis sector, and he okays it
with the touch of a control.  Not that he needs to, but it\'s always okay to make
sure that the computer doesn\'t give anymore access than is necessary to the 
passengers.  He checks his heads-up display and looks into the streaking 
whiteness of jumpspace.  Well since I have a week, might as well do something
useful, he thinks, and with some quick touches of the console, he punches up a 
hologame of Star Wars.  He grabs the controls to his ship, that are hooked up to
the display and blasts off to another galaxy until lunchtime.


- --
 Well, here is the end of turn #2, I hope I\'ve covered it all.  I will
be away until Jan. 14th, so I would like everyone to have there moves to me
no later than Jan. 20th.  Thanks a lot and have a great vacation.

 Oh, I will mail each of you an additional private turn, if have need of one.

I have a MegaTraveller question for those of you who have played MT before.
I have been a Traveller player/ref for about eight years.  I have to admit
that I never learned the High Guard combat rules.  But then again, the regular
Traveller Ship combat rules suited our needs fine.  I am trying to figure out
the Ship Combat of MT since I am getting ready to start reffing the first
serious Traveller, since MT came out.  I plan to simplify things some, but
I need a basic understanding of how the thing works.

Would someone please mail me a dialog or example of a ship to ship combat
involving the two following ships:

Type S Scout Courier            Type T Patrol Cruiser
Computer 1bisX3                 Computer 3x3
DefDM    +4                     DefDM    +4
Armor    40G                    Armor    40G
1 Turret, 3 beam Lasers, TL-13  4 Turrets, 3 beams Lasers each TL-13
Range 10,000km (Near)
Each has a Gunner(Turret Wpns)-1 in each Turret.

Naturally, the Scout should be beaten easily.  Please only include the
To Hit, To Penetrate, and To Damage rolls.  I understand the target aqusitions
etc.

Now what I have so far, for the scout is +1(Computer), -4(Type T\'s DefDM),
+1(Gunner) and the roll+dms needs to be an 11 or better on 2d6.  Thus, at this
point the scout ship needs a 13 to hit, but there is a Weapon Table DM that I
do not understand where it comes from.  Each turret has a UCP factor of 4.  Is
this the +dm for the weapon?  On the Beams table (Page 99) This would imply
that a UCP 1 beam needs a 10 (makes sense), a UCP 2, a 9 etc until a UCP of A
needs an 11 (of course I could be reading this chart wrong.)  Why does a Meson
gun, on the same chart, need a 4 to hit for a factor 1 gun and a 9 to hit for
a factor H gun when a factor H is considerably more powerful.  Then
penetration is less understandable.

Damage is also kinda confusing.  Lets say that the Patrol Cruiser fires one
battery at the Scout/Courier, then by the rules, the Patrol Cruiser will
automatically do 3 critical hits in addition to any other damage caused.  That i
s
kinda excessive.  To complicate things, Since the UCP of the laser turret is 4,
it gets a -6 on regular damage rolls, so the best that can be hoped for on a
2d6-6 roll is a 6.  On the damage chart, that gives us the options of: No
Damage, Weapon -1, Weapon -1, Fuel -1, Weapon -1.  So it is possible to do
no damage (2d6 roll = 3 - 6 = No Damage) and have three critical hits, in
which the ship is destroyed.  Makes good sense huh?

Now I know that I have to be missing somethings somewhere.  In all the rest of
the game nothing makes as much sense as this!  I like Traveller but this is too

If, in your campaigns, only military characters are "viable", then
I suspect it is because those campaigns revolved around military
themes and combat.  MT offers all the training services that
appeared in Traveller and its supplments. It is possible to
generate scientists, politicians, nobles, and several others.
Whether or not these characters are "viable" depends heavily on
the campaign.  I tend to run/participate in campaigns where the
primary elements are trade & commerce, piracy, and politics.
Any character with a background in these areas is viable in
this setting, whereas military skills only come into play
for things like protecting trade routes.

I\'ve been a Traveller player/ref for over six years (more like
seven or eight, I guess).  If someone wants to run a campaign
without a military emphasis, Traveller and MT provide plenty of room
to do so.

I\'m taking a poll of which version is preferred -- Traveller or MegaTraveller.
I\'ve played Traveller (2nd release with a lot of Paranoia Press expansions) and
I like it\'s free-form which makes it easy to change the game to your liking and make it as simple/complex as you like. On the other hand, I haven\'t played 
MegaTraveller (but I have heard reports of it being too in-depth technically 
that you loose some in the play).

So, what\'s your vote? Tell me (via email, please) which version you prefer and 
why. Be as long or short as you want and I\'ll post the results in a week or so
(eg. please don\'t flood the net with redundant postings when it only takes a 
week for a summary).  If you prefer another scifi (pronounced \'skif-ee\') game,
tell me about it, and I\'ll post that in the summary too. Also, please include
what expansions you\'re using, what they do for the game, and whether they\'re 
still available (eg. Paranoia Press put out some _great_ stuff but went out of 
business anyway).

See you in 1-2 weeks with the results (I may post a subsequent article if I 
get a large response).

Well I hoped you liked the first two turns, because this is where the fun
really starts.  Just to note, you are reading turn #3, and the game is on
turn #7.  If you have any comments about the game, I\'ld love to hear them,
it would be fun to know what you "the readers" think is going on, and that
might add some interesting things for the "players" to think about.

Well onto turn #3.

	Hello there, I hope you all had a great vacation, I know I did.  Now  I
didn\'t recieve a turn from either Ed or Kurt, but I will play this by ear 
anyway.  Please, from now on, mail all responses to the turn as: Turn (#) 
Response.  This will make it easier for me, to sort through my mail, and not
accidentaly delete anything.  Well, I hope you all have your Traveller minds in
gear, \'cause here we go.

*******************************************************************************

*******************************************************************************

Reminder:  I will get you the floor plans to the ship ASAP.  The copier broke
  	down where I work, and didn\'t get it done.

Note to Samantha:
	You can go ahead and create the info on your friend at Aramanx.  Just
mail me whatever you decide.

By the way, when you all boarded, you were asked to check all your weapons.

*******************************************************************************

	Erc and Samantha graciously accept the Captains\' invitation to drinks
in the crew lounge.  Steve has accepted Erekosses\' challenge to a hologame of
quickdraw, and they begin after Steve goes to his stateroom and returns.  
Samantha sit down by the CRT and begins requesting info about the Lewis 
Subsector, and Erc retires to his stateroom for a nap.
	Dan and Charlie go to thier stateroom and return with papers and a 
portable lap-top computer with heads-up display.  They both begin working
on what seems to be business.  They have schematics, manuals, and some small
circuit board/computer chip testing equipment out.  Moe and Curly both return
to thier stateroom, and are not seen till almost dinner.  
	Around 3:30, Robert walks out of his stateroom in slacks and shirt,he
is also wearing a windbreaker jacket over his shirt, the bulge is not noticeable
anymore.  He picks up some reading material and reads until dinner.  Samantha
has punched up some info on the Arter Apparel Corporation [you all get to 
see this since you all will do it anyway]:

	Arter Apparel Corporation, was established in 1067, and was founded by
Arter Espinoza, of Paya.  Mr. Espinoza dealt at first with designing and 
producing clothes for the working man, that were both affordable and fashionable
for the time.  He spent 10 years working from 1 factory on Paya, when the 
Imperial Government gave him a contract to produce clothes for the Navy.  These
clothes were basically for the enlisted personell in the mechanical, engineering and technical services.  His clothing designs were both practical and very
rugged.
	The contract propelled Arter from a small time manufacturer to a major
one.  He expanded across the Spinward Main, and in ten more years had grown 
almost twenty times his original size.  But in 1093, he declared bankruptcy, and
shut down entirely.  The reason for his closeing was not know, but in 1101 his
son, Hernan, re-open the original factory on Paya.  The company has remained
small since, and is working on another deal with the Imperial Navy.  This 
contract, if it goes through, would reopen nineteen of the twenty-five shut
down factories.

- ----<Above Data compilied before 1109
- ----<Data Below compilied 1115

	Arter Espinoza was believed to of had connections with both the Zhodani,
Vagr, and Aslan.  He was rumored to of had many dealings with all three races
that went possibly as far as selling Imperial uniforms to them.  It is unknown
if any of this data is true, but speculation is that this information was
found out by the Imperial Navy, and they caused the shutdown of Arter Apparel.
It is also rumored that Arter Espinoza had dealings with Steven Anderssen, the
rumored head of the Valhalla Family.


	Dinner is served promptly at 6:00 pm, and the Captain and Erekosse
are dining with you.  The meal is standard and all are present at a table that
elevated out of the floor.  The Captain is at the head of the table, and 
Erekosse to his right.  The table is circular, and going right to left, from the
Captain, this is how you are seated:
	
		Captain, Erekosse, Dan, Samantha, Robert, Steve, Moe, 
		Erc, and to the Captains\' left is Curly

	You all sit down and begin to eat, and the discussion is plain until 
Robert asks, "So Captain, how long have you owned this ship?"
	"I\'ve worked on it my entire carrer."
	"No, I meant how long have you been the single partner?"
	"Why do you ask?"
	"Well, I was just wondering what I could do with a ship like this," 
says Robert as his hand goes into his jacket, with a stern look on his face.
	"What do ...."
	"GUN!!!!" yells Steve ....


*******
	Well here is Turn #3, I hope you liked it, because it\'s gonna get more
interesting.  All responses are due to me by Feb. 1. No Later, if I get them 
sooner, we\'ll get turn #4 out, until then.

	Ah, hello there.  Well so far so good, no real problems that couldn\'t
be taken care of in getting your responses.  I\'m going to start posting to

(continued from turn3)

	"Why do you ask?"
	"Well, I was just wondering what I could do with a ship like this," 
says Robert as his hand goes into his jacket, with a stern look on his face.
	"What do ...."
	"GUN!!!!" yells Steve ....

	Roberts reaction is fast, but Steve\'s is a bit faster.  Robert\'s arm
comes partway out of his jacket, as Steve grabs it at the elbow.  Samantha,
reacting to Steve, uses her glass as a dagger, thrusting it into Robert\'s face.
It breaks, cutting his cheek, right below his right eye.  
	Erc notices Moe, drawing a weapon, and grabs him and they both fall to
the floor.  Erekosse sees that Roberts\' gun is out of his jacket and throws
Capt. Moray to the floor just as the gun discharges, striking Erekosse.
	Curly is out of his chair and has a gun drawn, he is screaming, "Okay, 
everybody freeze!"  Moe and Erc are standing up now, exchanging blows as they
both hold onto Moe\'s gun.  Steve has thrown Robert to the floor, and Samantha
and he are pinning him to the ground, there is heard a soft snap as Robert\'s
wrist is broken by Steve.
	"I\'m with the Imperial Bureau of Investigation," shouts Curly, "and I
and I said freeze."  Erc is distracted for a split second, and that\'s all it
takes Moe to flip him onto the floor, gaining his gun.
	Dan and Charlie are both quite shocked, they are frozen to their chairs,
and are remaining quite still.  Erekosse is bleeding from a leg wound, and the 
Capt is leaning over him inspecting the wound.
	With his gun trained on Erc, Moe pulls his wallet out of his pocket, and
shows him an ID.  Erc nods his approval, and takes Curly\'s hand to help him
stand up.  Moe has moved over to where Steve and Samantha have Robert pinned to 
the floor, his gun, a 9mm Sunb Pistol is lying on the floor next ot Steve.
	"Okay folks, just roll him over, and I\'ll put these cuffs on," says 
Curly.  Steve and Samantha comply, and Curly puts the cuffs on Robert.  
	Erekosse\'s wound isn\'t as bad as once believed, and is actually only
minor.  The Capt quickly bandages it up, and the says to Moe, "What the hell
is going on?"
	"Sorry sir," says Moe, "but we couldn\'t let you know we were onboard,
we weren\'t quite sure we could trust you."
	"I see," says Capt. Moray, "but what is this all about."
	"Well I\'ll tell you," says Curly.  "His name (picking up Robert) ain\'t
Robert Riechten, in fact, it\'s Hubert Ichten.  We\'ve been following him for the
past year, as he imitates representatives of Arter Apparel Corp, picking up
their merchandize, and selling it to friends of his on special worlds.  So far
he has made a cool million doing it, until we realized that he was using the 
Imperial ID of a dead man.  Myself and my partner (pointing to Moe) finally
caught him on Pysadi, and were hoping to find his buyer at Aramanx, but I guess
we will just have to settle with him for now."
	"If you don\'t mind captain, we\'d like to take him to his stateroom, for
some \'questioning\'."
	"No, I don\'t mind at all, just one thing, I\'d like you badge number if
I could have it."
	"No problem," says Moe, "it\'s CD10345-U9."

	Moe and Curly take Robert to his stateroom.  Dan and Charlie excuse
themselves, and go to their stateroom.  They both look quite shacken.  You five
are left alone in the Common Room.

   Well, what\'s next for the gallant members of the Ulysses?  Find out in two

Hi there! This group\'s still in business after all!

As someone pointed out, Books 4-7 give characters more skills than the basic
character generation rules. My solution to this is to mimic the skill award
system from those books as follows; each term, roll 2D four times. Award the
character a skill for each roll of 6+. Of course, the range of skills isn\'t
as great, but at least this gets over the "I\'m going to be a Marine so I can
get a more skilled character" syndrome.

My main gripe with "Merchant Prince" is the trading system. The tech level
modifiers on the number of passengers, amount of cargo and value of cargo
make it impossible to go from a low-tech planet to a high-tech one and make
a profit. It\'s also almost impossible to go along the Spinward Main because
of all those Non-Industrial worlds.

Question about the "Mercenary" abstract combat system. Is "Indigenous" a
mission by itself, or do you roll again if the opposition turns out to be
Indigenous, to find out what the indigenous troops (i.e. natives) are doing?
I\'d expect the latter, but the rulebook seems to indicate the former.

Question about "High Guard". If a few ships with black globes and particle
accelerators jump into a high population system whose main world has no
atmosphere, and turn off their globes just as they\'re passing the main world,
does this world then surrender, even if it has a few thousand SDB\'s? The
"Striker" rules say, "If one side has a particle accelerator in orbit over a
vacuum world, the other side should surrender"; they don\'t even try to say
what happens if a bombardment actually occurs, except to imply that it\'s
nasty and excessive. Also, what happens to matter (e.g. missiles) which hit
a black globe? I hope it doesn\'t get turned to energy and absorbed, because
if it does, one small missile would wipe out anything other than a large
battleship with a lot of extra capacitors.

Rob,

Although you are not an officially registered Traveller Mailing List
member yet, I got this message sent to me (by mistake) which was
apparently intended to answer your questions.

Subject: Re:  MegaTraveller Questions


First of all I\'d like to say that your scenario is set up wrong.
A Type-S according to MT rules and its powerplant does not have enough
power for 3 beam lasers much less 3 beam lasers + agility 2. 
The same problem with the patrol cruiser. It is listed with 2 beam
+2-missiles and it does not have the werewithal to handle 4 - triple beams.

However assuming you have similar type/tonnage ships and they have the power
to mount the weapons + retain the agility here is what will happen:

	Ship 1 (100t)			Ship 2 (400t)
Comp    1bisx3				3x3
DefDM	+4				+4
Armor	40G				40G
Lasers	x04				x04
Batt	  1				  4
Bear	  1				  4
I have combined the weapons into batteries of 3lasers. Otherwise Ship 1 can also
have 3 batteries rated at Factor 2. Same for ship-2.

Range 10,000 km (near) 	.  Appl. Skills Turret Wpns-1 each

Sensor Tasks:	Completed
Fire Combat:	

To hit from Ship 1 to Ship 2

Difficult,Off=comp model size, Wpn table DM, range DM; Def=def DM

Lets do the easy part:
DefDM= +4

Off
Comp= 1
Range= 0 (No modifiers for near range for lasers)
WpnDM=5 (Found by correlating weapon factor 4  with the to Hit line)
	(DM is 4 if weapon factor is 2)

Making the Die roll DMs 1+5+0-4=2. For a Difficult task, base die roll is
11 minus DM of 2. Ship 1 needs 9+ to hit 8+ with gunner skill.
(10+ or 9+ with skill if factor 2 weapons but u get 3 chances!)

You may have an old copy of Ref manual that had a misprint on beam table.
New edition or errata sheets correct that.

Attacking Beam Factor
	1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C
- - ----
To Hit:	3  4  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  9

Ship 2 to hit ship 1
same task
Def DM=+4

Off:
Comp=3
Range=0
WpnDM=5 (Same Factor as Ship1 but fired 4 times)

Overall DM is 3+5+0-4=4. Task is Difficult so 11-4=7. Needs 7+ or 6+ with
skill(Junk one Type S).

DAMAGE:
First of all there is a misprint. It should be: (P-93)
 	To penetrate a defense in starship combat:
	Difficult:Off=comp. model size,Defense table DM; Def=comp.model size.
Since in this case there is no defenses we ignore this to go to damage.

Again a misprint(P-94). DMS FOR SHIP DAMAGE TABLES

	* If the weapon inflicting the hit has a UCP factor of....
	 		
is  changed to:
	
	* If the weapon inflicting the hit is a spinal mount apply a DM of +6.

In other words normal weapons(less than A) use the damage table unmodified
except by armor. Unless of course they are nuclear missiles or pulse lasers.
Ship-2 will as stated do in addition 3 crits due to the diff. between
ship2\'s weapons and ship-1\'s size.

Any way now both ships damage on the 2-12 part of the chart. Which if you
don\'t have the errata runs now for -2 or less to 18, instead of 2-22. 
The MT errata is upto 17 pages and still growing. I for one am getting sick of 
it. GDW SHOULD have proof-read their game better. Maybe someone will
get the courage to post it all!!!

	Have fun. Get the errata and good luck.

		Ameer Z. Sulaiman.

P.S. A tentative suggestion may be to post errata for MT 1 page at a time
from different people unless there is s-one out there who has a friend
who types 500wpm+ or an optical reader!!

     It\'s nice to see the list working again. Thanks James, I know what a pain
this must be, keeping this thing working.

     Anyway, this is in regards to Adrain\'s note. When determining inital skills
we simply added an extra "one" to the basic skill determination so that you 
start with two and get two for commission, two for promotion and two for your
first term. Then it was standard progression after that. Characters generated 
from Books 4-7 tended to average 13 skill levels, this gives about the same
progression rate for Book 1 and Citizens of the Imperium.

Best,

Glenn

A long time ago I tried getting a submission off for the
Traveller Mailing List. Once I think I managed to get the first
paragraph off, but unfortunately the bulk of the posting (the
interesting part) didn\'t make it. I gave up, and the list has
been so quiet lately, that I thought it was defunct. But today
I recieved a small sign of life. So, for the fourth or fifth
attempt:

(By the way, I ASSUME this posting didn\'t make it before, as I
never saw ANY reaction, good, bad or indifferent, to it. If
you\'ve seen it before and simply didn\'t find it interesting
enough to bother answering, could you please send me mail, so I
know that at least the damn thing made it out? Thank you.)


I wrote (a long time ago):

Oops. It seems that the body of the text didn\'t make it. Sorry
about that. Here it comes:


(OK, Sven, hit "n" now.)




  I\'ve been  running  a  traveller campaign with a friend for a
couple  of years now,  and we\'ve decided to involve our players
in the ever-popular "Riddle of the Ancients".  But we have some
problems with that.

  For one thing, neither of us are particularily enamoured with
the official version of the riddle. We find it... unconvincing,
to say the least. And not only unlikely, which would not matter
- -  would indeed be a plus  -  if the story was a good one,  but
uncommonly bland and anticlimatic.

  You  may  disagree  about this,  but even if we had liked the
official version;  even if it had been marvelously well-crafted
and intricate tale, a veritable tour-de-force, a masterpiece of
poetic imagination,  it would still  have one  absolutely fatal
flaw: the players know it beforehand.

  So what we\'ve done is to whomp up an alternate version of the
riddle.  We\'ve tried to keep as many of the clues that has been
puplished  in various Traveller adventures as possible,  but we
are not fanatic about it, since our players hasen\'t encountered
any of the clues yet. What I\'d like to ask you, is to point out
weaknesses of the story  (preferably with suggestions on how to
plug the holes)  and especially  suggest embellishments of your
own.  It is our ambition to make  this story the crowning point
of the campaign,  and to provide something **really** memorable
for our players.

  OK, here it is,

               The TRUE Secret of the Ancients!

(Well, ya didn\'t REALLY believe the one about Grandfather, didya?)

  There were  TWO  ancient races,  and neither of them were the
droyne.  The first were the MASTERS,  amoeboid 4-kilo parasites
capable of taking up residence inside another creature and con-
trolling it\'s bodily functions  (anybody recoqnize these little
slimeballs? Well, I\'m not above borrowing from a master). For a
number of reasons  they preferred  intelligent hosts,  and they
enslaved  most of the  known part  of our galaxy,  annexing the
technology  of their slaves in the process  (this is the reason
for all those diverging technologies found on different Ancient
sites). They experimented on human, lupine and other stock from
Terra and on  numerous other races  from other worlds  in their
efforts to produce  the perfect subject.  They were  altogether
extremely not-nice, and if anyone wonders why I don\'t call them
Slavers and be done with it, it\'s because "slavers" is quite an
ackward word in danish.
  To the reptiloid \'STREE,  the manners, outlook, pilosophy and
behaviour of the  Masters  were an  abomination.  Their genetic
manipulations were downright blasphemous. Added to this was the
fact that Masters reproduced about once a century by fissioning
and seemingly lived forever (barring accident or violence).  As
anybody familiar with geometric progressions will know, that is
nothing less than a catastrophy waiting for a chance to happen.
The Masters firm resolve  to enslave any being they could  (and
exterminate any being they couldn\'t) was real unpopular too. So
shortly after the first  contact with the Masters,  the  \'stree
quietly began organizing an extermination program of their own.
  The  \'stree was an extremely old race even 300.000 years ago.
They had  been  mostly confined  to  their own planet  by their
concentration  on the social  and psionic  sciencies.  Now they
evolved  their  own  technology  in  record time,  enlisted the
diminutive droyne as troops (most droyne were too small to host
a Master,  and  their  psionic  talents  helped them detect the
caracteristic  double mind of a masterdriven sophont)  and went
to war!

Provisional timeline:

- -300.000 The  Masters thrive.  They transplant humans  to other
         worlds,  experiment on various terran and otherworldly
         fauna in an attempt to breed the perfect "steed",  and
         generally muck about.

- -250.000 Masters contacts  \'stree planet;  final war begins and
         lasts for 2.000 years, resulting in the total (total?)
         extermination of the Masters.

- -248.000 The  \'stree  retire  to  their  planet leaving droyne,
         vargr and humans to their own devices.

 -75.000 Nadir  of  droyne  race.  The mysterious "Grandfather"
         (\'stree wanderers)  visits about  20 droyne worlds and
         introduces the coyns.

     328 Foren Caliphren Doon is marooned on Frisini (later re-
         named Beck\'s World) in the Regina subsector.  He finds
         an ancient Master stasis field  and releases a Master.
         Establishing proper control of Doon without destroying
         his mind (completely) is difficult,  but  "Number One"
         has both time and patience.

     335 Doon  is  rescued.  Number One  decides  to search for
         other survivors.  As a cover  he makes  Doon establish
         the Octagon Society.

     423 Number One fissions.

     499 Number One  and his  "brother"  Number Two  decides to
         abandon the search and leaves for the core, where they
         intend to infiltrate the very top of Imperial society.
         Unfortunately  (for them)  upper-class  imperials rou-
         tinely employs psionic adepts as security guards,  and
         a Master-driven person is amazingly conspicious to the
         telepatically endowed.

     800 The Masters, now 32 in numbers,  succeeds in provoking
         the psionic suppressions in order to eliminate psionic
         adepts and lessen the risk of exposure. The move works
         to a degree,  but  the highest levels of  the Imperium
         continues to employ psionic adepts in secret.

    1116 The Masters unleashes a plot to eliminate Strephon and
         put a successor that they already controls on the Iri-
         dium Throne. The move is not totally succesful.

Provsional campaign outline:

  The players  are in year 1112 now.  In 1113 they will be sent
on a long exploration voyage into the Foreven and Far Frontiers
Sectors. Here, on the egde of charted space, they will encount-
er the planet of the  \'stree,  the first humans to have done so
for six or seven centuries.  On the surface the \'stree seems to
be just another low-tech barbarian culture, and the description
of them will be aimed at reinforcing that impression. You know;
big, strapping, muscular, spear-toting lizard-men wearing loin-
cloths  and tough expressions.  The \'stree elders will take the
opportunity to scan the  player\'s ship\'s library data  (child\'s
play to a cybernectic telepath).  They get suspicious over some
clues to  the existence of the Masters  (Hey,  The Psionic Sup-
pressions were rather conspicuous). They can\'t be sure, but de-
cides to check it out.  On leaving,  the captain will recieve a
\'stree servant ("We have  a parting present for you, Captain.").
If nessessary  with a little  pressure  ("Oh, I couldn\'t accept
that."  "Very well,  Massa Captain;  in that case we\'ll have to
excecute him...").

  They should return to  The Spinward Marches in 1116,  just in
time for the s**t to hit the fan. First the \'stree will somehow
manipulate  the  players  into a  round trip of  The Marches in
order to look for proof of the existence of the Masters, culmi-
nating in a visit to Twilights Peak. Next they will have to vi-
sit several of the warring  factions in order to discover which
one is controlled by the Masters. An extremely vicious fight to
eliminate  said Masters follows.  Finally, their  \'stree friend
will agree to help them clean up the mess and restore The Impe-
rium, but they\'ll have to figure out how by themselves.

  Well, there you have it. Any comments?

Well I\'ve been GMing Traveller for a while, and just recently started GMing
a group of guys here in Berkeley.  Now when they were rolling up their 
characters, they were using the new MegaTraveller Rules, and they were all
rolling Naval Enhanced characters, and Merc characters.  Well one thing led
to another, and I of course watched to make sure no "flubbing" of the dice
occured, and all was kosher.  Well on 3 of the 5 guys rolling up Navy personell
shocked me with there characters.  Two of them were Commodores, and one of
them was a Fleet Admiral.  These guys were also only around 44 to 52 years
old.  Now I can\'t quite understand why anyone would retire at that age, from
the military, with so many benefits, also I\'m quite shocked they got that
far in such .... ooops, made a mistake, I was looking at a the other guys,
the ages should be Fleet Admiral (38), Commodore (34), Commodore (42).  Now
the last guy isn\'t so bad, but a Fleet Admiral at 38!!!!  I think that\'s
quite incredible, but if you look at at the time period he was in the forces,
He joined during the 5th Frontier War, but still.

My question to all of you is, do you think the rank progression is too fast
in the Enhanced Character Generation.  I mean, if I got Strikes one after
another, it\'s possible to be an Admiral at age 22-24, if you make all your
promotion rolls.

Don\'t E-mail me, post it.  That\'s what this list is for, right?

Adrian and Glenn both propose ways to make "normal" generation characters
equivalent in number of skill levels to those generated from Mercenary, etc.

To be heretical, I\'ll suggest the reverse: "advanced" generation characters
get only two two-year-long "missions" per term instead of four year-long
missions, and thus end up with about the same number of skills as "normal"
generation characters.

Alternatively, for those who don\'t mind some additional dice rolling,
"advanced" generation characters must roll 7+ for each level gained, with a
DM -current skill level.  This makes high skill-level characters a rarity.
Variation: must roll 8+, DM +current skill level, making specialization the
norm.

Why do this?  Because I think Traveller characters with just a few skills
are more fun to play.  The skills can be used to generate a colorful
background, since that background is constrained enough (by career and
skills) to stimulate the imagination but unconstrained enough (not too many
skills) that the justification isn\'t boring or ignored.  Using these
techniques, Mercenary characters who want ACR-4 are not going to have a lot
of other skills----they will be combat specialists and that\'s all.

Related note on skills:  Does anyone else think it odd that characters get
a generic "gun combat" skill where they get to choose the weapon group of
choice while they have no choice as to which "knowledge" skills they will
achieve?  In reality, the reverse seems to be the case: you will be trained
on whichever weapons your unit uses, while you will learn the "science"
that you are most comfortable with.

This is in regard to a submission about 22year old Fleet Admirals. If you
read the player\'s manual carefully, it says that officers get promoted
only ONCE a term unless they get assigned on Special Duty as Military
Attaches. This means that your Average Fleet Admiral will take about 7
terms and will be 48 or so. Theoretically if he burns a load of Brownie
points can get Special Duty every tear or so you can be a 22 year old
Adm. But not by just going on strike missions. NCO can get promoted every
year and sometimes do so but 28 year old Master Gunn Sergeants are rarely
a problem. 90% of the time the above rule restricts officer promo to once
every 4 years. Special duties(as should be) being the only exception. 
I generally tell my players that Fleet Admirals don\'t go scumming around 
so most PC\'s are restricted to rank O4(Commander) O5(Captain) at most 
unless u give me an awfully good reason to let you. A Fleet Adm. wanted for
treason or negligence on the run from Naval Int will brighten any
campaign up. But quite a few PC\'s don\'t like that view so they can\'t have it.

Hi,

I\'m running a MegaTraveller campaign based around a Subsidized Merchant.
I\'m beginning to have a few problems with the system for trade.

1. When you are seeking passengers it says as +DM to number of pass.
use source-destin TL. Implying that more people travel from Hi Tech to
Lo Tech worlds. Tourism seems a thought but is there anything else that
may be a reason for the above DM.

2. When you roll on the Cargo Table. How exactly do you know what is
freight and what is cargo? Also their is a vague mention at the end to the 
effect that the resulting cargo is ALL the cargo available on the world.
If that means for a given destination, that\'s ok but if it means for 
all how do you figure? Merchant Prince implied that what u get from the
table is all Cargo(Speculative kind) if u don\'t buy it, it becomes 
freight? Thoughts....

3. How has someone else handled a merchant campagn out there?

4.If you have a J-1 ship with extra fuel tanks but you are jumping
across 2 parsecs with passengers. Do you charge them for 2 jumps 
or just one. If there is an \'official\' rule to the effect( that I missed)
I\'d like to hear of it, also if any personal solutions to the problem.
The Encyc. mentions to the effect that you charge for each jump. But
it doesn\'t make sense, it seems to assume that you are making a jump 
through an inhabited system so the person can get off. But in many cases
the first jump is to deep space and the next to a system. Seems like a
fleece for passengers and a game bug ready to blow.

Thanx in advance y\'all.

	Ameer Z. sulaiman.

Right!  But, I won\'t add a me-too reponse to one sent to the list
just a day or so ago, which was:

	THOU SHALT LIMIT COMMISSIONED OFFICER PROMOTIONS TO ONCE/TERM.
	EXCEPTION: OFFICER\'S SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENTS.

I know, I tripped over this one many times until I read the fine print.

Another thing people trip over and forget to do often is the the Navy\'s
Specific Assignment Retention rule, which states that you keep the same
specific assignment during the next 1 year on a 1D roll of exactly 6.

For those MT referees who looked at the patrol cruiser in the Encyclopedia
and wondered how the Type T could supress pirates with 1 beam and 1 missile
here is the real Type T. Consider the book version(which is wrong anyway)
as a stripped down high endurance version. BTW EMM was removed because
most of the time in custom duty you have to announce yourself anyway and
if he\'s unfriendly he\'ll shoot. Besides EMM doesn\'t help once you are
engaged. Electronic Circuit Protection is useful in avoiding damage.
(Subtract 1 from all Comp hits, comp-2 becomes comp-1, comp-1 becomes 
no effect). Its low on endurance but its still better than the CE and 
with internal fuel tanks comparable to the Corsair.

Ameer,
	I decline to comment on the first three questions, but as for
number four:

>end included text.

I would tend to give people a small price break.  After all, your
costs are lower (maintenance on jump-1 drives is less than jump-2) and
they are taking twice as long to get to their destination.  If yours
is the only run to the destination system, however, charge all that
the market will bear.

One thing that I might do (if I were the owner of such a ship), is put
gambling tables and such in the lounge.  Give the passengers an extra
week to gamble.

History:
- ----

Architect:  Eric Anderssen, Regina 68-1094

Hull Laid Down:  100-1094

Maiden Flight:  145-1097

Original Owner:  Jan Morris

Payments Left: none (craft was pre-paid for)

	Jan Morris was the son of a wealthy Noble, he was fond of women (of
course :-), ships, and space.  At the age of 22, he left the Navy, and started
a small shipping business.  By 11-1085 he had grown from one ship, to a fleet 
of seven, then tragedy struck.  While cruising on a modified Subsidized
Merchant, which was his private ship, he was attacked by pirates, and his wife
was taken, and his son killed.  Jan escaped with his life by pure accident.  The
attack took place while he was in the engine room, and the first laser hit, 
jammed the door to the compartment.  The ship was boarded, stripped of valuables, and left a hulking wreck.
	Jan managed to free himself and land his craft.  When his father heard 
of the incident he was outraged, and put a bounty on the pirate leaders head.
His name, at that time, was Yurl Hagard.  A known pirate from the frontier.
It took five years for Jan to recover from the loss, and when he did he began
design of a new ship, the Ulysses.  Selling his Subsedized Merchant, and with
a loan from his father, he placed the order on 5-1093, and a year later, the
architect had the plans ready.  The hull was laid down as soon as it was able
and then the ship became a reality.  Having now weapons possible, unless 
sacrificing precious cargo space, its main threat was it\'s agility, and still
claims to be the most agile merchant craft ever built, in its tonnage class.
	Jan picked a new crew, and one of his first choices was a young and
upcoming merchant, Jordan Moray.  Jan and Jordan flew together for eight years
and then the second tragedy occured in Jan\'s life.  While in th Regina Subsector
, Jan heard that a person fitting the description of Yurl was on Regina.  The
rage was seen by Jordan growing in Jan.  Jan dumped his cargo and ran to Regina
at faster than light speed.  Landing on Regina, he set Jordan and the rest of 
the crew to finding cargo to be hauled, while he went in search of the Yurl
look-alike.  He was so caught up in his hate, that he had forgotten the Law 
Level, and kept his Gauss Pistol with him.  When entering the Merc Hangout, a  
local bar in Regina, he "bumped" into the Yurl look-alike.  He drew his weapon
without thought, and would of fired if he could, but an undercover police
officer saw him draw, and called him to halt.  Jan spun to see who it was, and
the officer fired once from his auto-pistol, mortally wounding Jan in the chest.
	Jan died minutes later.  The crew was called to identify the body, and
the officer was not cited for incorrect proceedure.  No one at the bar remembers
seeing anyone who fit the description of Yurl Hagard, but its rumored that he
was on Regina, and might have even had a play in Jan\'s demise.  From merchant
code of law, the ship rightfully passed to Jordan Moray, who assumed full
duties of Captain.  In 1114, he disbanned his old crew, because of lack of
funds, and in 1115, allowed Erekosse Wildantor to join him in starting a 
merchant fleet.  So far they have had little success, running jobs all around 
the Spinward Main, but who knows .....

Well A lot of people said they read these turns, so I\'m still posting to
here.  I\'m also posting these to the Traveller Mailing List, to catch them
up too.  You are still about 1 month behind the players, and I think you\'ll
catch up in 3 weeks.  Well here\'s Turn 5 in it\'s entirety.

- ----


Well here is turn #5, and I must say, I think it\'s going good so far.  Tell
me what you think.  If you like the progress so far, or you think the senario
is a bit goofy.


********************************************************************************
				NOTES
********************************************************************************

Maps of the ship will FINALLY go out in the mail on Wed. Feb 23.  I photo
copied them, so sorry for the quality.

For all of you who read rec.games.pbm, I will start posting the original moves
there, just to let everyone read them.  I might also post to rec.games.frp.

Also, if you want to make the due dates for the turns closer together or 
father apart, tell me in your next response, since I never thought to ask if 
you guys like waiting two weeks.

********************************************************************************


	Steve notices that Roberts\' gun is still on the floor and he picks it up
.  Samantha says to him as he\'s doing this, "Nice moves . . . you spent so much
time at the hologames, I thought you spent your service time flying a desk."
	"No, not really, it\'s just that I never really got to play games while
on duty, and I sure miss them.  By the way, thanks for the help."
	"No problem.  If he\'s gonna be stupid enough to draw a gun with a person
on either side of him, he deserves to be taken out.  Such an amateur."
	"You said it," says Steve.  He walks over to the Captain and says, "This
is quite odd," displaying the gun.  "It seems that the bullets in the magazine,
and in the chamber have wax points."
	"Odd indeed," says Captain Moray. "But first I thank you all, and 
espcially you Steve, for bringing the extra precaution along," he points to the 
gun now visible underneath Steve\'s jacket. 
	"Sorry sir, but it\'s just that old habits die hard.  I didn\'t know if
anyone else here could be trusted, no offense sir, but it\'s just a precaution
that I\'ve learned to take from the old days.  You see, I was a Force
Commander in the Corps, and I guess my reaction was just textbook.  I would
have tried to warn you about this earlier, but I didn\'t get the chance to talk
to you alone, and I didn\'t want to get the other passengers worried, possibly
over something trivial."
	"No harm done, and I offer this instead, how\'d you like to help, and
do some security for me."
	"I\'d like that sir."
	"Good.  I\'ld also like to enlist both of you in this endeavor, if I may.
Since it seems you are both to be trusted."
	"What do you want us to do," replies Erc.
	"First off, I\'m going to join their \'interrogation\', and I want 
Erekosse to give you each your weapons, and arm himself.  Samantha or you Erc, 
should punch up that badge, while the other goes with Erekosse to check out
Hubert\'s cargo.  See if you can get into it.  Steve, I want you here, in
case things get messy."
	"Right."

	As soon as Erekosse leaves, Dan and Charlie walk out of their stateroom.
They both still look a little spooked.  The go over to the chessboard, and sit-
down to a quite game of chess.  They don\'t say anything to anyone, and fear 
still burns in their eyes.

	Erc has left with Erekosse, and Samantha says to the Captain, "You know,
I know some people on Aramanx.  Maybe we could help these guys, if they are for
real, nail the buyer.  We still have his cargo and his ID.  If we get enough
info, one of us could say we came from him, and set up the deal.  None of us are
connected with Imperial Law Enforcement . . . it would be perfect."
	"Sounds interesting, I\'ll think about it."
	Steve sits hismself down in a G-cushion chair, in the common room.  He
has a good view of the corridor, and especially Roberts stateroom.  His jacket
is unbottened.  Captain Moray punches the button and the door opens, Robert, Moe
and Curly are having a discussion.

	Samantha sits down to the CRT and punches up some info on the Imperial
Bureau of Investigation.  The computer says the the ID is from the Commerce
Division of the IBI, and that the agent using it is Undercover, the ID is 
valid as of last computer update, which was 18-1105.


********************************************************************************
			Crew Move
********************************************************************************

	Erekosse brings Erc downstairs, and into the Crew\'s Lounge.  He goes 
to the ships\' locker door, punches in the security code, and opens it.  He 
hands Erc his Auto Pistol, but Erc says, "You use it, I\'ld like to use the
Laser Pistol, if you don\'t mind." 
	"I guess it\'s okay, but I\'m only giving you one power pack."
	"Fine."
	Erekosse also takes Samantha\'s Snub Pistol, plus an extra clip, and 
then shows Erc to the cargo bay.  They walk around for a few minutes, and then
they see the crate.  It\'s quite large, about 6-8 tons.  The crate is quite 
normal except for the vaccum sealed door, and the keypad computer lock.  
	"What do you think," says Erekosse.
	"Don\'t know, looks can be decieving."
	"Can you get into it?"
	"I think so, how about getting me an electronic, and mechanical tool 
set, and I\'ll see what I can do."
	"You got it," says Erekosse as he goes and gets the necessary tools.

	After Erekosse gets Erc the tools he needs, he goes back to the crew
lounge and sits down on a couch.  He gets out the medical kit, and re-dresses
his wound.  The Captain did a good first-aid job, but it needed to be done
properly.  He then goes to his stateroom and gets on a new pair of pants, plus
a holster for the pistol, and puts it on.

	Captain Moray is given a chair, and asked to sit next to, or behind
Moe.  Robert is sitting on his bed, cradling his broken wrist and is flanked
by Curly, who has hooked up two probes to Robert, one on his hand the other on
his forehead.  Moe begins by asking simple questions about names, places, and
dates.  Robert is quite seroius in all his answers, and it\'s noticeable, he\'s
trying to contain himself.  Curly is monitoring the questions, in a box, and
it\'s quite easy to see that this is a lie detector.  
	Moe has moved the desk, and has a bunch of papers on it, plus a 
recorder.  They (Moe, and Curly) seem to take no notice of Robert\'s wounds, and
continue the questioning.  

	Erekosse comes upstairs and hands Samantha her Snub Pistol, holster, and
an extra clip of ammo.  Dan and Charlie both see this, and it is quite 
disturbing to both of them. Erekosse nods to Steve, who doesn\'t respond, and 
walks down the corridor to Roberts stateroom.
	Erekosse enters, and Robert is startled a bit.  Curly asks, after 
Erekosse is seated, if he could use the medical kit, to fix up Robert.  Erekosse
, with a nod from the Captain, gets it, and hands it to Curly.  After Curly
finishes, Robert continues to talk.  Most of the places are unknown to either
Erekosse, or the Captain, but to Moe and Curly they seem known.  They keep
talking for about an hour, and both Moe and Curly don\'t seem quite satisfied.

	An hour passes, and Erc is looking at a jumbled mess of electronic
circuits, and wires.  He throws the laser-tap to the floor and screams, "Shit!
Who made this damn thing?  Probably a fucking genuis."  He feels his patience
give out and he thinks, \'This is way above my expertise, but maybe not above
two men I know.  First, though, maybe I should ask the Captain.\'

	Moe and Curly leave the stateroom, and so do Erekosse, and the Captain.
	"I hold you two personally responsible for endagering the lives of my
passengers ...," starts the Captain.
	"Us!" screams Moe, "If it wasn\'t for those two idiots, "pointing to
both Steve and Samantha, "none of what just happened would of.  I know you have
rights Captian, but let me tell you, those two are the ones who should be locked
up right now, not him."
	"Especially, since you just royally fucked our best chance to get to his
buyers," adds Curly.
	"Now hold on here," says the Captain.  "First of all, you two didn\'t
show any permits, and I want your guns now!  Second, I have real doubts who you
say you are, and until we get out of Jump Space, your on my ship, and you follow
my laws, and you two broke them, bigtime."
	"Okay, if you want our guns, take them," says Moe, and he and Curly hand
over their guns.  They are cut-down sonic stunners, real military stuff you 
gather, and they oddly weigh a good amount.  "But let\'s get one thing straight,
Curly or I gets to stay with that man, we are not leaving him alone, so he can
off himself.  We will switch off every 8 hours or so."
	"Fine, but the other will be confined to his stateroom.  And now, I\'d
like to check your staterooms, if I may?"
	"Go right ahead," says Curly.


	The search of Moe and Curly\'s room produces 3 sets of ID for each
of them, they show up-to-date pictures of both, and have their "real names"
plus addresses.  The ID\'s are a military pass, government pass, and out-of
Imperial boundary pass.  Included are a few notebooks filled in info on Robert,
his meeting times, names, places, and other things.
	 Robert\'s room is then searched, with Robert\'s total objection, and you
find, an ID/Pass Card, possibly for a lock, or something else.  A hand computer,
that is still on, a disguise kit, toiletries, a clothing repair kit, plus a
blade w/scabbard.

	Moe and Curly both go into their stateroom, and Erc comes up to the
Captain, and says, "I can\'t break the lock, but I got a feeling that Dan and
Charlie might be able to.  Only because it\'s way above my expertise, and they
did say they were computer experts."

Hello Everyone! Looks like the list is really steaming again.  I\'ve
gotten about a dozen "add me" requests in the last week, and about 20
messages have flowed through the list.  Unfortunately, I\'ve also got a
half-dozen "delete me" requests.

Most of the people who leave this list request it because they find they
can\'t keep up with the volume.  While it is true that probably most of
these people just aren\'t interested enough in the subject matter
anymore, one person said that it would be nice if the list was
"Digestified", that is, bunches of messages get sent out as a single
message weekly or bi-weekly, instead of everyone\'s individual messages
getting sent out to the list.  He said that the uncontrolled flow of
many small messages was somewhat annoying.

>From an administration standpoint, the Digest format has other positive
aspects.  One is that mail delivery can be postponed to non-peak hours.
Another is that fewer messages get delivered, since they go out in
bunches.

But it has its drawbacks.  The list administrator must come up with a
tool for preparing Digests, and a mechanism to fire them off (which I
don\'t mind doing, when I can find time).  Another drawback is that
submissions are no longer distributed instantly.  A final drawback is
that it becomes more troublesome to reply to individual messages in the
digest (even counting digest-bursting programs).

So, the questions:

	Do YOU want the list changed to a digest format?

	If you voted FOR a change to digest format,
	How often would you like delivery to occur?
	every 14 days? 7 days? 3.5 days? 2 days? 1 day? other?

	Other comments/opinions?  Am I full of crock for suggesting this :-)?

(I\'m leaning toward yes, every 3.5 days, myself)

I would have suggested we move to a newsgroup of our own
(rec.games.frp.traveller or rec.games.traveller), but we haven\'t
demonstrated that a) we have enough people, or b) we have consistently
high traffic, yet.  (According to spaf, the USENET expert on these
things).

TL difference is also a DM on the Cargo Table. All in all, it\'s almost
impossible to go profitably from a hi-tech world to a lower tech one.

The Cargo Table is similar to the one in the old Book 2, Starships. It\'s
what you get paid Cr1000/ton to deliver. Speculative cargo was handled very
differently, and in my opinion much better; there was a big table of
different types of cargo; each had its associated base price, and DM\'s
for purchase and sale prices. You rolled on the Actual Value table both to
buy and to sell. The only problem was that trade class didn\'t affect what
you got, only what you paid for it. An industrial world was just as likely
to supply food as it was to supply machinery.

Does anyone have a good speculative cargo system?

>3. How has someone else handled a merchant campagn out there?

I\'ve run merchants in solo "campaigns", both in Spinward Marches and Solomani
Rim sectors. Using the "Merchant Prince" rules, the Spinward Marches was very
difficult to make a profit in, unless you stuck to trading between two or
three nearby, suitably matched worlds. Regina and Ruie, for example. The
Solomani Rim was much more profitable, especially when I got to the Vegan
Autonomous District. Lots of Hi population worlds next to each other; you
couldn\'t go wrong!

Well, you definitely have to pay for life support twice. It\'s also going to
take you another week, and time is money. I\'d charge them twice, but maybe
give them a discount if I were feeling generous and rich (i.e. if I were in
the Vegan Autonomous District).

    TL difference is also a DM on the Cargo Table.

I suggest you use the MINIMUM of source and destination as DM.  So flows
are the same in both directions.

    Lots of Hi population worlds next to each other; you couldn\'t go wrong!

Funny, when I travelled through that area, the authorities were well aware
of profits to be made and either (1) the merchant cartels leaned heavily on
so-called "free traders" (sugar in your LOX) and took a hefty bite out of
profits (reducing them to zero) or (2) the level of taxes or bribes
required lowered profits to zero.  Competitive market, you know...

According to Traveller and The Merchant Prince (Book 7) it says:

Add (or subtract) difference between source world and market world tech
levels.  This would imply that there would be a want to travel to low tech
worlds.  In the past I have ruled that more people want to go to the high tech
world, but being the devils advocate, if I know how to build air rafts, then I
can get a real high paying job on a low tech planet.  Call this one as you
like.  I send more people to the high tech world.

Well, I think that you would make two rolls.  One to see what freight is
available and another to see what cargos are avaiable.  This is because you are
dealing with two different agencys.  First, frieght is something that someone
wants shipped.  Finding this cargo would be found through some shipping company
(kinda like Greyhound or UPS).  Speculative Trade cargo requires the trader to
go around to various agencys or brokers to buy goods.  You would not go to UPS
for this, but rather some wholeseller/warehouse.  Under the old rules, you
rolled for the amount of freight but only got one speculative trade cargo.


>3. How has someone else handled a merchant campagn out there?
>
The only bad thing about a merchant campaign is the players (mostly the ship
captian/master) ends up doing a solo game that has no role-playing.  It is
travel, get cargo sell cargo etc.  The rest of the players get kinda board with
it.  Also, as a ref, I find that I give them too much cash.  My players are
cleaver and they find ways to manipulate the system to always make a profit.
We have had fun with it and it is a way to raise capital in a hurry.

I don\'t think that it is ever said.  However I think that you would probably
charge them the one system value.  They are going to be inconvinenced by the
two week journy and the fuel doen\'t cost that much.  The overhead
(environmental controls) for the second week is going to cost more, but I think
that a trader would take a smaller profit if it ment a full load.  A lot of
role-playing can come from this.  If your ship is the only one in the area and
there isn\'t a lot of choice, the passengers will be cut throat and pay big
bucks for that stateroom.  Where as on a high visability world, why should I
pay 10,000 cr to spend two weeks on that scrap when I can pay the same amount
on Joe\'s Far Trader and get there in one week.

Just as in real life, supply and demand are in effect.  If you are competeing
with a large lines who happens to hub on this system, you aren\'t going to find
anyone who will pay 10Kcr to make a two week jump.

I was thinking of a way to send ship maps to everyone and I was curious as to
what format you would like them in.  I have a friend with autocad so I should
be able to get the files in several different formats.  What format do you
think would be the widest of use?
   a) Post Script
   b) HPGL
   c) GIF (or some other screen format)
   d) or just a list of X,Y coordinates that you can use your own software
      to print?

Please respond by E-Mail and I will post a follow up with the responses if you
are interested.

Thanks

Here is a ship that I have been tinkering with using MegaTraveller\'s ship
construction rules.  I basiclly perceive it to be a large trading vessel.
Unfortunatly, I was unable to dervive sufficent cargo space to pay for a
larger jump/manuver drive combo.

Let me know what you think, and if you see any terriable errors let me know.
I plan to use this ship in my upcoming game which will kind of be a Leviathan
adventure (Adventure 4).  This configuration should be able to turn a profit
(bairly).

This ship is loosly based on the older Leviathan Merchant Class Ship.
While, it is some 200 tons, larger, this space has gone into a larger
cargo bay (The original had 70 tons).  Jump and Manuver were cut back
since this will work jump-2 worlds.  The ship contains four decks, and
three sections.  The top and bottom decks are landing bays for the
Modular Cutter (cargo and fuel modules) and the ship\'s launch.  These
decks are in the center section of the ship only.  Engineering takes
up one section and is comprised of four decks.

	How about this for a compromise of sorts:

	From low tech to high tech worlds you get a lot of country
hicks going to the city to hit the big time.  From high tech to low
tech you get tech experts going for the high paying jobs.  And going
round trip are the rich tourists.

	Thus, the low passages tend to be full of country folk when
going from low to high (apply DM appropriately).  More mid-passages are
sold to techies going from high to low (apply DM as in the book).
Finally, the number of high passages is relatively independent of tech
level (no DM for TL).

	Caveat: I haven\'t tried this myself.  The thought only just
occurred to me.

Okay boys I got a real mean question.  Has anyone figured out an easy way to 
generate the: length of day, year, and seasons of a planet created using the
advanced rules in Scouts (Book 6), or the new MegaTraveller Rules.  I would
greatly appreciate any help on this, since I really need to generate this
type of information for a game I am running.

I\'d be inclined to scrap the TL difference entirely. Starport quality should
influence trade; trade classification should influence trade; population
should influence trade. I\'d only expect TL to affect trade in industrial
cargo; a TL15 computer is worth more than a TL7 one, but TL15 fruit is still
fruit. It might have some effect on packaging, but that\'s all.

I was running a subsidised merchant anyway. Serves you right for poaching on
my territory!  :-)

I still think that the old Book 2 system was far superior.

Unless I am mistaken a  formula for computing the length of the year is in fact
given in book 6
if there isn\'t a formula there The following should work:
        (r^3/2)/(m^1/2)
where r is the star-planet radius in AU and m is the stars mass in solar
(earth sun) masses. The result is given in earth years.
the length of day is highly variable and there isn\'t really any way to generate
it using any formula one good way might be to roll 7 dice and add them together.
This will generate results that fit roughly into an acceptable range (7 is a
little low, but is sufficiently rare) and will center around 24 hours which
seems to be a number conducive to human life
As for the seasons this is a diffucult question, as a season is really a change
in the climate. And as the climate at a given point on the surface of a given
planet is a function of a lot of variables I can\'t think of any way of
predicting the season without working it out on a case by case basis.
The equinoxes and solstices will however follow the same progression as they do
here being separated by 1/4 of the year.
I hope this was of some help.

Brad,
  Starting on page 43 of Book 6 Scouts, under Orbital Data, all of the data
is presented to compute orbital distances and temprature.  There is some errata
that was presented in an issue of the Journal of the Travellers Aid Society.

To compute orbital period (year), you need the Mass of the Star in Solar Masses
(Interpolate value from chart on Page 45, Type D stars are VI on this chart.)
Lets assume a F8v star, its stellar mass is 1.114 (40% between G0 and F5).
Next we need the distance in AU, here you need the orbit of the world and get
the distance in AU from the chart on page 46.  For an F8v star, the habital
zone is between orbits 3 and 4, so we will place it in orbit 4, or 1.6AU.

The orbital period is  Period = (Distance**3/Mass)**0.5 or 1.917509 Terran
Years.  Then multply by 365.25 to get days.

If you want to get seasonal data, you can use the Exxentricity chart on page 48
(change Temperature to Lumiosity in these charts).

An inverse formula is given if you know period and mass to derive distance, it
is  Distance = (Mass*Period**2)**0.33  Where Period is Terran Years.

The same formulas work for satellites where Period is in lunar months (28 days)
and Mass is combined Earth Moon Masses and distance is in Earth Moon Distances.
(400,000 Kilometers)

Now for temprature,
  Temp = 374.025 * Greenhouse (1-Albedo)(Luminosity**.25)/Distance**.5

So for our example, we will use a Greenhouse effect of 10% (1.1) and an Albedo
of .3 (Earth Like reflectance)  The Luminosity is 1.326 and the Distance is
1.6AU (Now this should yeild a slightly cool planet, since the real habitable
zone is orbit 3.5 and we are in orbit 4.  We get 244.32 degrees Kelvin,  Terran
average is 288 degress kelvin, so our world is 44 degrees colder than earth on
the average.  Feel free to adjust the orbit to bring tempratures with in
tolerances.

There is a second formula that takes the temperature and gives distance.  It is
in error in Scouts, the correct formula is:

  Distance = (Luminosity**0.5)*(GreenHouse*374.025*(1-Albedo)/Temp)**2

Now as far as the day lengths go, there isn\'t a way presented.  I am not a
physics dude, but I would guess that the size of the planet and its orbit
control the speed of rotation.  For simplicity sake, assume that a size 8 world
rotates in 24 hours, the smaller the faster, the larger the slower.  I am sure
that a quick formula somewhere.

Does anyone have a copy of those pages online, the ones the guy just mentioned
only because my Scout book is 3000 miles away, and I don\'t find the info in the
MT rules.

I have a MegaTraveller Question that frankly has be baffled.  I was computing
orbital periods and distances between the Gas Giant and main worlds.  I was
trying to compute the travel time between the gas giant and the main world.

Now my main world was at 4.0 AU (habitable temperature for a world around a F1v
star).  Now the habitable zone for an F1v star is orbit 5 (2.8 AU) but that was
way too hot, so I moved it back until the temperature came within reason.
My closest gas giant was in orbit 9, or about 38.8 AU.  Now they give a
calculation of 150 Million Kilometers = 1 AU.  This isn\'t very accurate, but it
is close.  For the sake of argument, we will use the distances in KM as
provided for 2.8 AU to 38.8 AU.  The net distance if the worlds were at their
closest would be 5,804 Million KM - 418.9 (round to 419) Million KM or
5,386 Million KM.

Ok now to change gears for a second.  If a 1G vessel takes  8 hours to move
from a size 8 world to 100 diameters, that would imply a mean vessel speed of
100,000 miles/hour (Size 8 world = 8,000 mile diameter * 100 diameters =
800,000 miles / 8 hours = 100,000 miles)  Or 160,000 KM/hour. Now I know that
acceleration is constant to the mid point, thus the ship can achieve higher
velocities, however there must be a maximum velocity where the thrust can
no longer accelerate the craft.

The travel time, if we assume a max speed of 160,000 km/h would be about 3365
hours or about 140 days.

Now figuring that the folks at GDW had ran into this questions the mention
something about an "In System Transfer" in the Imperial Encyclopedia under
travel, but they mention nothing more about times or methods other than to say
that you use "In System Transfer" to get to a gas giant.  I remember a journal
article on the subject where you "goosed" the jump drives, but it goes against
all normal jump drive rules.  No to mention that the fuel consumption would
make gas giant refueling impractical.

Does any one have any light on
  a) In system Transfer
  b) Better time computations to and from Gas Giants.

Any help would be appreciated!
Thanks in Advance, Rob

Ok, I should have read the books a little better,  (Thankful I still have my
old Traveller stuff :-) .)  Here is a little \'C\' program that I whipped up
that computes travel times.

/* TTIME.C
   Rob Miracle

   Language:  Ansi \'C\'.
   Date:      March 18, 1989

   This program computes travel times for Traveller, a role playing game by
   Game Designer\'s Workshop.  It takes the distance to be traveled in
   Kilometers and returns a table of times.  The times are in days, hours,
   minutes, and seconds.  Each line represents the 6 different manuver drives
   in the game.  It is listed in G\'s of acceleration.  The formulas are based
   on ones found in "The Traveller Book".  They were originally published in
   Traveller Book 2, "Starships".

   This program compiles correctly under Turbo \'C\' V2.0 and VAX/VMS \'C\'.
   The only possible incompatiblity is with the \'pow\' function.

   This program is placed in the public domain and I don\'t think that I
   am infringing on anyone\'s copyrights.  No warrentys or guareentees implied
   and the author assumes no liability.

    double TDist,TAccl;
    double Seconds,Minutes,Hours,Days;
    char buffer[128];

    TDist = atof(buffer) * 1000.0;
    printf("Days     Hours    Minutes  Seconds\\n");
    for(TAccl = 10.0; TAccl < 70.0; TAccl += 10.0) {
        Seconds = 2.0 * pow(TDist/TAccl,0.5);
        Minutes = Seconds / 60.0;
        Hours = Minutes / 60.0;
        Days = Hours / 24.0;
        printf("%-8.1f %-8.1f %-8.1f %-8.1f\\n",Days,Hours,Minutes,Seconds);

Any help would be appreciated!

There are some rules expanding the _Scouts_ system of world generation
published in the _Traveller_ supplements _Grand_Survey_ and/or
_Grand_Census_ (published by _The_Digest_Group_). These rules covered
local day length, possibility of locked rotation (day length same as
year length), orbital tilt (angle of polar axis) and means of computing
local (i.e. longitude and latitude) mean temprature from the other factors.

The rules (one book or the other, can\'t remember which) also suggested how
to create the continents of a world, how to allocate the population and
how to compute technology spread over a world (different in starport and
in the outback).

There is other things there too, that I can\'t remember right now, but they
expanded government and law levels, I belive. Great books for creating
consistent worlds, but that requires _some_ amount of work.

These computations are fine except there is no maximum velocity where the thrust
can no longer accelerate the craft. There is no resistance to slow it down, so
any
thrust will be used to accelerate our spaceship. Using those formulas it takes
 733,893 seconds to get to the gas giant. 203 hrs or 8 1/2 days. The maximum
velocity is:3.6 million m/s or 13 million kph (1.22% of the speed of light.)
This is incedibly fast but not out of reason for the drives used. (this is for a
1G
ship a 6G ship would take 4/10ths as long and be going 6x as fast at midpoint.)
I hope this helps a little. In system travel can take a long time. Space is BIG.

I believe what they are referring to as \'In-System Transfer\', is the
\'transfer orbits\' required to move for the orbit of one planet to
the orbit of another.  The \'transfer\' orbit is the path taken by the
spacecraft.  The high-energy transfer orbit has the star as one focus
of the ellipse, and the new orbit as the \'apocenter\' of the ellipse.
(The apocenter is the part of the ellipse furthest from the star.)
The low-energy transfer orbit, or Hollman orbit, has the pericenter
at the starting orbit and the apocenter at the ending orbit.

If 1,2 are the foci, then \'p\' are the pericenters, and \'a\' is
the apocenter if the sun is at \'1\'.  

The Hollman transfer orbit is the lowest energy method of 
getting to an orbit.  It assumes that the fuel burn is short
compared to the travel time.  If you have a constant acceleration
engine (ion-drive, or something), the transfer orbit will be much
more gradual, resulting in a spiral that moves out toward the
other orbit.  The travel time is not necessarily longer for a
spiral transfer orbit, since greater speeds are possible.
Most of the time in the Hollman orbit is coasting.

The following is an Introductory Adventure for MegaTraveller.  It serves as
a  good adventure for new and old players alike.  It\'s primary purpose is
to introduce the players to the combat system and the game in general.  It
is the basic Shoot out at the OK Corral scenario.  There is some mystery
that leads to a confrontation.

If you are a player and are not going to ref, feel free to read down to the
REFEREE\'S Section, since the beginning provides an introduction to the game
and a discussion on the stellar question "Why Adventure?"  If you are a
player feel free to give this to your Traveller Ref so that you might have
an opportunity to play this adventure.  This adventure should only take one
evening session of about three hours to complete.  Preparation is minimal.

Now for the quasi-legal stuff.  This adventure is Copyright (c) 1989, Rob
Miracle.  It is being distributed to the public domain freely.  Any attempt
to make a profit by selling it to others, including publishers is a
violation of the copyright.  Any similarity to any other published
adventure is totally coincidental and unintentional. The characters and
places and events are fictional.  Any similarity between them and any
real-life people, places and events is also purely coincidental.

Author\'s Notes:  Our Traveller group had not played Traveller in some 12
months when we got MegaTraveller.  A new referee ran three sessions before
he left on Co-op.  So we had several players who\'s characters had been
propelled into the future since when I stopped reffing last time, it was
the year 1111.  When the previous referee started, it was some time in
1115.  Several players were playing new characters and all were new to
MegaTraveller (since three sessions 9 months ago does not stick to ones
brain cells well).  Any way, when we played before, we used a modified
version of Traveller/Snapshot rules and no one, including myself, had used
the MegaTraveller combat system.  With the fact that I had modified MT\'s
combat system, we needed a "combat oriented" starter scenario to teach the
players the combat system.  The next adventure will deal with ship combat.
After that, the players should know the rules well enough that the plots
can be developed to the color that these people are used to.

Asumptions:  This adventure is set during the first year after Emporer
Strephon\'s assassination.  War has not reached the Spinward Marches except
for some Vargr invasions on the coreward edge.  Most communications with
Captial/Core have been cut, and the Duke of Regina has assumed command of
the area.  While the rebellion has little to do with this adventure, it
does add flavor.  Little work should be necessary to convert it to your
local worlds and situations.

Stardate: 103-1117
Location: Starduster Lounge
          Credo Orbital Facility
          Regina/Regina/Spinward Marches-1910

Situation: For existing characters, each has spent the last 3-10 years
living on the spoils of their adventures.  A wonderful drug has kept them
as young as when they discovered it.  Young that is in all but their
wallets.  Anagathetics are costly but worth it.  Though they are not
busted, the high life has taken its toll both mentally and financially.
That adventuring spirit is hard to keep down.  It is like spring fever.  An
itch to travel and to get into trouble  seems invite the soul of the
adventurer.

Time and urge have brought our troop of adventurers together again.  Why?
For more credits?  For more fame? or infamy?  Sure, that is an
attractivness, but it is the thrill and challenge that drives these
travelers to a frenzy.

And there is the new blood, the rookies.  You have seen the universe from
the orderly nature of the service.  It is just enough to wet your appetite.
Sure see the universe, dock at many different ports of call, we are all
familiar with the ads.  But what they don\'t tell you is you have no freedom
during those years.  One mistake and it is 20 years on a Kinur Cruiser that
has been hulled into an orbital prison.  So you are now  free of those
bonds.  Those worlds that you paid a call to beckon you to learn more.  See
the planet from things other that orbit or the cold greyness of the
starport.  That is why you are here.

- ----

While, the acquaintance of each of you may have been brief, you have  grown
appreciation for each other.  The war stories remind each of you of a time
past, of glory won... and spent.  And there is the rebellion.  The great
empire that once stood high and proud is crumbling like dry bread.  The
emperor is dead and several people claim the iridium throne that Strephon
sat upon until the assassin\'s bullet tumbled him from it.  The great
network has failed.

The vargr, while personable have started to claim some of the  coreward
worlds in the sector, while the Aslans approach from the trailing  edge.
The Swords Worlds, and Darrians have strengthened their domains while the
Imperium\'s rule is weakened.  Several small groups have formed their own
government.  The Zhodani are still weak from the Fifth Frontier War that
ended only 8 years ago.

But these other governing bodies are not the threat, the threat is an
internal one.  Just who are you loyal to?  Is that Battleship with Imperial
markings going to wave hello with their hands or their meson gun?  Are they
loyal to the Arch Duke of Regina or are they rebels trying to gain a little
bit of power among all this chaos.

These are just a few of the inter-workings among the cosmos at the moment.
What are you going to do?  Sit around and drink Rhylanor Ale all day?
Wither away because the rebellion has cut the anagathetic supply lines and
you are paying triple cost on the black market?  Or are you going to get
into business for your self, and reopen those supply lines?  Are you brave
enough to take  an under armed freighter and run cargo though battle zones?
Hunting?  Run and hide?  Or head out and smell the spoils excitement.

REFEREE\'S Section
(This section is to be presented to the players, notes specific to the
referee will be indented and labeled REF:)

As you sit around the Starduster, a very attractive woman approaches you.
By her dress you would guess that she is of a high social class.  She
appears to be nervous as she clutches tightly to a rolled up document.  As
she gets within three meters (15 feet), she gets a panic look on her face
and she turns and bolts.  Seconds later, a man in a dark trench coat leaves
in a slow, deliberate pace.  The large brimmed hat hides his face from you.

If you follow him he will board a shuttle for Credo Down Starport, on the
Surface of Regina.  The woman is nowhere to be found.  No one seems to know
him.  Checking at Astro-Transfer Shuttle Service, the carrier, he is
identified as John Smith.  No other useful information is to be gained.  It
would appear as if he was in no means following her.

REF:  The group may try to follow him to the surface.  Let them, but delay
them by several minute by having the Starport Authority place them in a
holding pattern for 10 minutes.  This will make it hard for them to find
him.  Hopefully they will soon realize that they are on a wild goose chase.
Of course that means another 10 minutes before they can launch and 23
minutes to orbit and another 10 minutes or so before they can re-dock at
Credo Orbital.

After you dock back at Credo Orbital and disembark, you see the woman at
the Oberlin\'s ticket office.  She picks up a bag and heads toward the
docking bay where a 1000T merchant vessel is docked.  She is still
clutching the paper tightly and appears to be very paranoid.

    REF:  The group will probably try to follow her onto the
    vessel.  But ship security will stop them since they do not
    have a boarding pass and they can\'t identify her.

The vessel\'s next port of call is listed as Yori (2110/Regina/Spinward
Marches), a small, highly populated desert world, 2 parsecs rimward from
Regina.  That flight is booked and several passengers are on a waiting list
wanting transportation to Yori.  The ship departs in two days.  It seems
unlikely that she could have walked up and purchased passage, though that
is what it appeared. Investigating with the ticket agent will prove to be
useless.  The agent is very loyal to Oberlin\'s and will not release any
information about passengers.

While you are trying to gain information, the woman will disembark holding
the document.  It would appear that she has moved into her stateroom for
the journey.  Her level of paranoia has increased.  She passes by you in a
very non-approaching fashion.  As she passes, she whispers "Help Me" and
continues to walk back towards the mall area.

She ducks into a coffee shop and sits at a booth.  If you join her, she
will announce herself:  "Hello, I am Arreen Applegate.  I have a need for
an escort.  Your name was given to me as someone I could trust.  I need a
body guard to escort me to Yori and back.  Also I need you to guard me
while I am there.  I have to see some one and I fear for my life.  Twice
today, someone has tried to kidnap or kill me.  Once was in the bar when I
first tried to contact you."  Her paranoia causes her to faint for just a
second.  "I can not offer much, just my thanks and passage to and from
Yori.  If all goes well, I may be able to give you something that has
monetary value.  Do these terms seem acceptable to you?"

You notice from her speech that she is very educated.  She never seems to
use a contraction or slang, yet her inflections of her voice are smooth and
harmonious.  She has a natural charm to her voice.  With the quality of her
speech and because she is showing emotions, you rule an android out.  She
knows a lot about you as things come up in conversation.  All are things
that she could find out through good research.

Finally she speaks again.  "I will be spending tonight and tomorrow night
in the starport hotel, room Delta 148.  I have reserved passage for you on
the Spinward Way (the ships name).  It departs in two days at 08:00 hours.
I wish to retire to my room at this time."

    REF:  She is quite bossy.  She seem to not ask for things,
    assuming that the group is smart enough to know that they
    should go with her etc.  Arreen Applegate is a local woman of
    moderate social importance.  Her UPP is 789ABA.  She is a
    noble and has several administrative type skills.  She has
    little combat experience.

    The rest of the time at the starport and the journey to Yori
    are of little significant.  You can fill in here with other
    encounters of strangers shadowing her etc.  Any thing to
    build the mystery.  She will not release the document under
    any circumstance, nor will she give any information.

Once you arrive on Yori, you land at the starport.  It is about 38 degrees
Celsius (about 100 degrees F).  It is the middle of autumn here.  Yori is
about the size of Mercury with a population of 70,000,000.  The atmosphere
is standard.   The planet has a law level that prohibits all firearms.  She
can get one pistol through for each person.  She can\'t get long arms
through though.  (NOTE:  If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have
guns!)

    After they arrive, she will rent a standard air raft and
    travel to a city of about 1,000,000 that is a 1 hour flight
    away at 90km/h (55mph).  Note, the heat will drive most
    people out of their armor.  On the way, roll for surprise.  A
    second air raft will come up behind the players air raft and
    start taking pot shots with an Advanced Combat Rifle with
    Discarding Sabot rounds (DS).  If they get surprise, have
    them hit the air/raft and knock out 1/4 power required the
    driver to have to make rolls to fly it every time they change
    course.

    With any luck, one of the players will take out the gunner
    and then the driver will turn and run.  This will give the
    players a chance to take out the driver. They now get an
    undamaged air raft (it was rented from the same agency) and
    a rifle.  There is little information to be gained from the
    two thugs.  All they have is about 400 credit\'s Imperial, and
    a 9mm auto pistol with two clips.  There is a second clip of
    DS rounds for the ACR and they have fired about 4 shots from
    the first clip.

    Just before they get to the City of Tanzor, they need to make
    another surprise role as a speeder blows by them at about 190
    km/h.  This is just to scare them a little.  When they arrive
    at Tanzor, she will get out of the air raft and go into a
    bar.  She will come out and say "Let us go 30 km southwest of
    town."  About a kilometer out, they will see an air/raft (or
    more) and a speeder sitting atop one of the dunes.

    Use as many NPC thugs as you need here.  Remember you can
    only fit four people to an air/raft (The player\'s air/raft
    may be larger so that they all can fit in one raft!)  Each
    thug is armed with an SMG and is sweating in their cloth
    armor.  As they get within 20 meters, they are signaled to
    stop and Arreen gets out.  She walks toward the thugs.  A
    gentleman in a business suit gets out from the speeder with a
    brief case.  They walk towards each other.  A conversation
    goes something as follows:

Man:   "Give me the paper!  Here is your payment."
Arreen: "Here."
(Man looks at the page)
Man:   "THIS IS FAKE!  WHERE IS THE REAL PAPERS?!?"
(He grabs her and she drops the brief case.  He begins to drag her toward the
speeder.)

    Here is where the fire fight begins.  If the characters do
    not start it one of the thugs will.  Treat them as UPP
    777777, +2 to hit (+1 Dex, +1 Wpn).  The fight should end
    with the thugs and man down.

    After it is over, Arreen confesses that she was being extorted
    by the man.  She is a reporter and had some information on
    the man, who is a known organized crime figure.  He was
    buying the information from her.  She could either sell it or
    die.  The brief case is full of paper shreds, since he had
    no reason to pay her anyway.  The exact contents of the
    document and the names of the NPC\'s are left to the referees
    imagination.

HOT SPOTS

    When I ran this adventure, I got thrown for a loop by a
    Psionic/telepath who kept trying to read everyones minds.
    With some lucky rolls and her only trying to read surface
    thoughts I was able to avoid dumping any real information
    about the plot, though some things may not have mattered.

    Your players may want capital up front to take this mission.
    They need to get at least their hand guns on the planet.  If
    you let them have too much fire power then it will be over
    before it starts.  I think that them at least getting the one
    rifle before hand is important since it gives them an edge.
    If they are really greedy then they can sell the speeder
    unless it gets shot up real bad.

    You don\'t have to let it end here.  There could be contaband
    in either the air/raft that they procured or the speeder that
    they could get caught with.  Or questions about the weapons
    or the deaths/injuries of the thugs can lead to legal
    problems.  You could let Arreen get kidnaped and have the
    group go and save her.


Happy Travelling

The only problem I can see at first glance is that if it TL15, maintenance may
be a problem if you\'re intending to use it in the Spinward Marches. The number
of TL15+ starports in that sector can be counted on one hand.

Well have you ever noticed that in all (to the best of my knowledge) the ships
and craft in MegaTraveller are build at TL-15.  J-Random Type S: TL-15.

I have not tried to construct a ship of a lower tech level, but I suspect that
you would not have much of a ship.  :-)

I have to agree with Adrian Hurt\'s comments that the old Book 2 system
for speculative cargo is superior to the newer 
Merchant Prince/Megatraveller system.  On the other hand, the old system
is not perfect.  I have noticed that someone with the appropriate skills
and a little luck can make a *huge* profit in a very short time with the
Book 2 system.  I\'m not sure if the problem is the modifiers for some
cargos, the price percentage table, or the lack of a limit to the DM on
the price roll.  Furthermore, as he points out, you are just as likely
to find food available on an Industrial world as machinery.

It seems to me the ideal system would have, aside from a few
adjustments, the following:
     1)     A set of tables for each trade classification,
            giving base purchase price for each item on this type of
	    world, possibly with tech level modifiers.
     2)     A master list with all possible cargos, their base resale
	    price, resale price modifiers for each trade classification,
	    and again possibly for TL.  It would also have any notes
	    regarding special considerations: special handling,
	    packing for products that don\'t come in standard cargo
	    containers, etc.  
	    
	    For example:
	    		---- Resale ----
	    Item	Value	Modifiers	Source Worlds
	    Grain	Cr500	Ag -30%		Ag
				Hi Pop +20%
	    Notes:
		Shipped in bulk: cargo hold must be devoted to grain,
		and have installed a special liner.  Explosive: Air in
		hold must be filtered to remove grain dust, or any
		spark or flame will cause an explosion.

I also like the idea of adding a negotiation task for MT, to replace the
skill bonus one gets on the Actual Value table in Book 2.  This would
make for a little more role-playing in the trading process, and help
minimize the effectiveness of a high Broker (or Admin, in Traveller)
skill.  (Recently, I had a group that included a Broker-5 ex-Merchant
turn Cr 700,000 in MCr 24 in about three months game time, using a 400
ton subsidized merchant.  I refuse to let this happen again.  In the
meantime, a highly valuable and underpriced cargo will come available,
tying up most of their capital.  Then the man who arranged the sale will
tell the pirates which ship it\'s on, and they\'ll be waiting.  It\'s low
and underhanded, but *highly* effective.)

Developing all this looks like a rather daunting and time consuming
task, and I would like to get some feedback before beginning.  If there
is enough interest, I\'d also like to get some help from the net.  If we
can agree on a format, I\'d be happy to collate entries for the master
list.  Then each person working on the project could prepare the
available cargo table for one trade classification.  The references
given below would provide a good starting point.  Any takers?  Any
comments?

Maybe it\'s just me, but wouldn\'t shipping grain in hard vacuum be almost
ideal??  Keep the pesties down, as well as reduce the explosion hazard...  I
know it was just an example -- I was mostly curious if I\'m missing
something...  (e.g. popping corn probably should be kept pressurized, although
using an inert gas would still seem to be easier than filtering :-)

Well, here is turn #6, things couldn\'t be going any easier (heh) on this

in this turn,  I am warning you now, since one of my players was offended, I
thought it would be wise to mention it, please don\'t let young children read 
this.

Okay, onto turn #6, so far so good, eh.  Nothing is quite as fun as people
bunched up in Jump Space, my grandma used to say.  Here we go....

*******************************************************************************
			   PLAYERS\' MOVE
*******************************************************************************

	The Captain begins, "Well I think we have all had quite an exciteable 
first day, why don\'t we all hit the hay, and start fresh tomorrow.  Erekosse, 
make sure you put those guns (refering to the IBI guns) in the ships\' locker."
	"Right."
	"Good night all," says the Captain, and before he goes downstairs he 
says to Dan and Charlie, "Just get a good night sleep, and don\'t worry.  Every-
thing is under control."
	"Whatever you say, sir." Replies Dan in a somewhat steady voice.

	The next `morning\', Samantha, Steve, and Erc walk out of their 
staterooms to find Charlie working on the CRT in the common room, his portable
computer is out, and is plugged into the back of the CRT.  Steve walks up to him
and says, "What do you think your doing?"
	A little startled, "Who, me?  Oh, I wasn\'t tired, and thought I would
get some work done, I wasn\'t doing anything wrong, honest."
	"Oh yeah, then why the setup?"
	"This, ... ummmm well you see I\'m working on Shih\'s algorithm, and I 
needed some data from the ships\' computer, and ...."
	"I don\'t think he\'s doing anything wrong," says Erc, "I mean, what 
could possibly ... wait a minute, that\'s no algorithm, those are blueprints."
	"Yes, they are," says Curly, and you all turn to face him.  "I asked
him to use his skills to find me a copy of the keypad on Hubert\'s crate.  I
was just going to inform the Captain ...."
	"You were going to tell me what?" says Captain Moray, as he enters the
common room.  Charlie\'s portable, is printing something up, and Erekosse is with
the captain.
	"As I was saying," continues Curly, "I was going to tell the captain, 
that I wished to open the contents of the crate, as soon as possible, and I 
enlisted the aid of Mr. Stevenson (Charlie) in order to get that done faster."
	"First off buster, you have no right to give this man permission to use
my ships computer to do anything.  Second, I was looking through these," holding
a few papers, that were last seen in Curly\'s room, "and it don\'t look to good 
for you guys."
	"So you think you know something," says Curly as he reaches underneath
his zip-up sweatshirt.
	"Freeze buddy!" yells Steve, he has a Auto Pistol out, aimed right at
Curly\'s chest, Steve\'s draw was lightning fast.    
	"What the hell is this," screams Moe, as he exits Hubert\'s stateroom.
	"Don\'t move," says Samantha, her Snub Pistol out, and trained on Moe.
	"I don\'t know what this is all about," says Curly, "but you\'re in some
serious shit now, when my superiors find out about this ...."
	"Shut up," says the Captain, "and pull your hand out from underneath 
that jacket, slow."
	Curly produces a cigar in his hand, and drops in to the floor.  "First
off boys," says the captain, "tell me why your really here.  Your documents say
that you guys weren\'t even supposed to be on this case."
	
	Erc has now picked up the printout that Charlie printed, Charlie has
shutdown his portable, and unhooked it from the CRT.  Erc sits down, and says,
"Captain, from these prints, I think I can get the crate open."
	Samantha says to the Captain, "I figured something was wrong with these
guys, their badge ID\'s are 12 years old.  Tell us what\'s going on Captain?"
	"First," says the Captain, "Erekosse, go check up on the main (computer)
and see if anything was tampered with.  And if you Erc and Samantha, could show
Moe to his room, I\'d like to talk with Curly alone for a bit."
	"If I could sir," says Charlie, "I\'d like to go to sleep.  I\'ve been up
quite late."
	"Go ahead."

	"Where should I start, Captain," says Curly.
	"How about the beginning."
	Steve is sitting in a cushion directly opposite from Curly.  His gun
is holstered.  Samantha and Erc come back and go to the galley, make a quick 
breakfast, and bring it out to the common room.

	"Well it began about 5 years ago, I was just an average undercover
agent working on Rhylandor.  I was really not to keen of staying with the 
agency, until one day.  I was asked to investigate a reported robbery.  Robbery
I thougt, for an IBI agent.  Well I went to the Starport, and checked up on it
and it seems that a crate of clothing from the Arter Apparel Corp. had missed 
it\'s assigned pick up.  The guy who was delivering it was pissed, to say the 
least, and I went and filled out the proper forms.  I didn\'t think anything
of it, until about 6 `months\' later, when I was told to go investigate another
reported robbery.  Well it was another cargo shipment from the same company, 
and I figured I might as well do some checking.  Seems that the cargo all came
from the same place, and shipped by the same carrier.  With somemore digging, I
found out that the carrier was owned by Steven Anderssen, and I thought, hey
maybe there is something going down, and I enlisted the aid of my good friend
`Moe\'.  He\'s also in the bureau, but worked in the `recycling\' department.
	After finally getting permission, I got on-board the ship carrying the 
merchandise.  It was owned by one AJ Floyd, a known pirate.  The bust went down
perfectly, no hassles, nothing.  We arrested the man who picked up the 
cargo too, Hubert Icthen.  We didn\'t know it at the time, but he was the right
hand man to Steve Anderssen, and since we really had nothing on him, we let him
go.  The little shit ran to his boss, on Valhalla, and this is where it leads up
to.  I got nothing else to say."

	"Not so fast, I didn\'t say you could finish talking."
	"Well I\'m done man, and if you don\'t like it, than fuck you."  He says 
as he gets up.  Steve gets up, but the Captain motions him to sit down, Curly
leaves, and goes to the stateroom.  About 5 minutes later, Moe comes out, and
says, "You know, you really shouldn\'t be such an ass.  Let me tell you, that 
that man in there is the finest man I know.  He did everything by the book, and
you\'re putting him through hell."
	"Sit down, and tell me what the hell you\'re talking about."
	After a long talk, Moe finally tells you that when they got to Valhalla,
Steven was waiting for them.  Curly\'s wife, and two kids were there, as `guests\'
of honor.  Hubert was also there, and then it began.  Curly was there to give
the man a summons to the Sub-Sectors court, and then Steven flipped.  He drew a
gun and shot both Moe and Curly, not with real bullets, but tranqs that para-
lized them.  Hubert then pointed out the fact that they had lost 5MCR, in that
lost shipment, and Steven just went berzerk.  He killed Curly\'s wife, shot
her through the head, at point blank range.  All Curly could do was sit and
watch.  He then let his men have fun with Curly\'s daughter, they raped her about
twenty times before killing her.  Steven was there, but Hubert wasn\'t, he had 
left, because he felt `ill\'.  They then made Curly\'s son play Russian Roulette,
he lost at the first pull of the trigger.  They then packed us in a shipping
crate, and left us in a low berth.  We were found two weeks later, by some guy
who was inspecting cargo.  I took a vow to help Curly find Steven and kill him.
Hubert\'s the only one who knows where Steven\'s hide-out is, and we\'re going to
get him.

	"How about we see what this can tell us," says the Captain, as he
produces, Hubert\'s personal computer. "I think we also might want to find
out what\'s in that crate, plus I think Hubert will be more than willing to
tell us, if you get my meaning."


*******************************************************************************
			     CREWS\' MOVE
*******************************************************************************

	Erekosse checks the computer, and everything seems fine, except that
there is a program running.  The Anti-Hijack program was up, and he couldn\'t
remember starting it.  The time start shows the minute they entered Jump Space,
but ... maybe it was Charlie?  I better tell the captian, he thinks, but first
let\'s do a full system analysis.

*****

So, what will you do, open the cargo?  Interrogate Hubert?  Can Erekosse really
do a full system analysis?  All these things and more will be told, next time.
As soon as I get your response....

I use the TL difference for passengers, cargo and freight are another thing.

The way I look at it, freight is freight, it is 1000CR per ton, whether it
is a ton of fruit or a ton of diamonds :-). Cargo is the thing you make money
on. And the OLD way was much better at handle the chance of getting burned and
getting rich. I remember as a player once buying some radioactive for 50% of
base cost and selling at 400% of base cost. I also took some baths that way,
too. I am in the process of modifying the Mega-Traveller cargo tables to 
reflect varying prices. As soon as I get the time to finish them I will post
it here. Sorry, they are not finished but not enough hours in the day. If 
anyone is doing something similar let me know, maybe we can brain storm.



>I still think that the old Book 2 system was far superior.

I agree whole-heartedly

This little program creates pages of throw away NPCs.  Enjoy.

- ----8X-- Snip Snip Snip ----

/* NPC.C -- A MegaTraveller Non-Player-Character Generator
   Rob Miracle

   Language:  ANSI \'C\'.
     This program has been successfully compiled under Turbo \'C\' V2.0 and
     VAX/VMS \'C\'.

   Purpose
     This program was written to generate pages of NPCs for MegaTraveller.
     These NPC\'s are for Non-important characters who will most likely
     be envolved in combat with the players and whose life span is so
     short that they do not need more detail.  The output is simple.
     Each NPC has their 6 digit statistics which are hex digits ranging
     from 0 to 15 (for simplicity, these range from 2 to 12).  The stats
     are coded in the following order:
       STRENGTH DEXTERITY ENDURANCE INTELLEGENCE EDUCATION SOCIAL_STANDING

     After the stats are their pluses to hit for Strength in hand-to-hand
     situations, their pluses to hit for Dexterity for range combat.  Their
     pluses to hit for a particular hand to hand weapon and their pluses to hit
     with a range weapon.  Add the two together and get their total combat
     pluses for each type of combat.

     Now for the quasi-legal stuff.  Due to the simple nature of the
     process, I am not going to bother with the paper work and let the
     Common Copyright Law take care of me!  It is being placed in the

Here is the alternate combat system that I am using.  I think some one out
there may find it useful.  When I read and reread the MegaTraveller Personal
Combat system, I was confused and overwhelmed with the procedures and
calculations.  Marginal Success and Zero Penetration were just too many terms
to be throwing at players who were somewhat overwhelmed by the game anyway.

My system is very similar to that of MegaTraveller, however, I changed the way
that penetration works.  When you have hit your target, you compare the
weapons penetration value to that of the armor.  If the penetration is
greater or equal to that of the armor, you do full damage.  For each point of
penetration that the weapon is rated below that of the armor, the damage is
reduced by one dice, until no damage is done.

Example:  4mm Gauss Pistol  Pen: 4, Dam: 4 firing against Cloth Armor (5).
So since the Gauss Pistol\'s pen is 4, and the armor is 5, it would hit and only
do 3 dice of damage.  A 9mm auto pistol pen:3 and dam:3 would only do one dice
of damage.

If the roll to hit was 4 greater than was needed, the penetration is
doubled.  If it is 6 better then it is tripled, and if it is 8 better then it
is quadrupled.  This allows weapons to penetrate on good hits armor that they
normally could not.  Now, under this system, no weapon can do more damage than
it is rated.

One other problem spot has been found.  If a weapon as a pen of 0, it could
never do damage to armored folk (0*4 = 0).  In this case, we treat the weapon
as having a pen of 1-1.  So if I shot someone with a body pistol and they were
wearing cloth armor, and I rolled 8 better than I needed, then 1*4 = 4-1 = 3
or 2 dice of damage.  Cloth armor is not something that the common thug should
have.  Before I had every NPC in cloth, not any more.   I think that this will
work well, only play testing will tell for sure.

As far as damage goes, I do not use the hits and damaged/destroyed values for
characters.  Instead, I apply each dice of damage to a random stat (STR/DEX/END
or SUSP/LOCO/FRAME).  When one stat is reduced to 0, the unit stops functioning
(goes unconscious).  When all three are reduced to 0, then the unit is
destroyed.

What do you think?

Rob

I\'d never really thought about it.  The comments were paraphrased from
an article in _Challenge_ #26.  Now that you mention it, there is
probably a better way.  I\'m not sure about the effect of hard vacuum
on most grains, but popping corn probably doesn\'t have quite the
explosion danger of, say, wheat.  Pumping in nitrogen looks like a
good solution - it\'s cheap, is reasonably inert, and most beasties
can\'t breathe it.  Of course, the crew can\'t either, making
inspections of the cargo hold rather difficult since most ship designs
have only an iris valve or hatch into the cargo bay.

Thanks for the comments.  Any others?

Better to use inert gas.  My thoughts come straight from Robert Heinlein in
_The_Moon_Is_A_Harsh_Mistress_ he mentioned something about shipping grain in
pressurized containers.  Something like all the moisture sublimated out and
ruined the grain.  Now where _he_ got it, I don\'t know.  Nor do I know if it\'s
true, but better safe than sorry.  Anyone know if it\'s true?

Nitrogen would be ok, I think, but better to use Helium.  Not as cheap, I
agree, but even more inert and unbreathable.  Of course Helium does tend to
escape from the interstices between molecules, but I would think a 2 or 3 week
voyage wouldn\'t produce much of a difference.

On the other hand, maybe I\'m mis-remembering the story...anyone know for sure?
I\'ll look it up tonight and report back.

Subject: Calculating distances

GDW\'s Ref\'s Companion has a time formula and orbit table at various G\'s

Has anyone seen Digest Group\'s "Starship owners Manual vol 1"? It has
rather extensive rules (suggested only if you want the complexity) for
determining time and space calculations in both normal and jump space, 
including various orbit calculations, geosynch orbit, to/from jump point, etc.

The rules are presented in a flow charts format called "T-charts" Its rather
amazing to consider that this book was done by the same people who edited the
rules books.  The T-charts are *real* flow charts, rather than lists with
numbers pre-pended to them as in GDW\'s manuals.  They have arrows. They look
nothing like computer flow charts but are instead offset boxes with clear
labels of where to go to for a different step. None of this "Oh, yeah. These
three steps only apply to vehicles, so I skip them"  There are even examples,
right there next to the rule that they are about right there on on the flow
chart.

One of the intersting things about these rules are the "performance" tasks, by
which the person doing the task determines how difficult the task is.  This 
allows the navigator and/or engineer a greater chance of improving their 
performance while piloting the ship or working the drives, thus shortening
the amount of time or length of journey. (Of course you can mess up and
make it take longer but thats life)  Quite detailed and requires a calculator,
but if you want the complexity its there; which someone was the point of an
SF rpg, its a framework that expands to whatever depth you want to take it.

I\'d go for vacuum, on the grounds that if the ship gets attacked, the cargo
hold will be depressurised like the rest of the ship. Unless the crew want to
risk explosive decompression, that is.

Just as a matter of interest, how is grain shipped today? I haven\'t seen any
articles in the news about grain ships or grain-carrying trucks exploding, so
someone must have solved this problem already.

Subject: Generating Xboat routes on a sector map

This is a two part question:
a) is there any semi-automatic way for generating xboat and other
   routes from the information on a sector map?

b) given a text file with the sector or subsector information, what is
   a good format to store the xboat route information? (I am thinking
   of a text database format to be compatible with that used for sectors)

The system generation rules don\'t say how to construct the xboat (and
other, like the established trade) routes from the system info.  The
rules are sparse as to what to do; they basically say to look at the map
and connect stars so that systems with A or B starports pass within 3 parsecs
of each other.  (Ref\'s manual p. 18, Communications Routes)  Well and good
except that I\'m not going to *draw* a star map, thats what I have a computer
for.

Also what about the other routes?  The xboat routes are the Jump-4 routes
which the communications take.  What about the trade routes? It is conceivable
that the Megacorp. and Sector/Subsector wide routes of the various companies,
although slower are as important in diseminating information, especially in
outlying star systems. There are no rules as to where these should go (follow
the xboats, but also go to other places)

Money in the future.  We\'ve always thought it would be bank cards and monster
ATM\'s, but...  with the speed of Jump and all it\'s effects on information
transfer, are electronic money transfers the norm for characters?

GDW makes a point of telling us how big the currency is, and I\'ve seen no
mention yet of the actual mechanics of economic exchange...  Are all the Free
Traders using cash and barter?

How are you folks handling this?  Any creative solutions?  Or have I missed
something?

	Being a first time poster, I don\'t know if this is an already ans-
wered question...

	I recently purchased the MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual (I\'ve played
Traveller on and off for about three years). One of my primary reasons for
doing so was the new ship design rules presented therein.

	After reading the section on vehicle design thoroughly (?) and
having skimmed the MT errata from the mailing list archives, my question is
this:
	At TL 17 (or beyond, perhaps), why is there no antimatter powered
jump drive?

	Reading the Traveller rules and supplements leads me to believe
that starship jump drives are powered directly by large capacitor banks
(which may be charged in other ways - energy absorbed by black globe screens,
for example - see High Guard) and only indirectly by whatever fusion type
power plant the jump drive includes (not the standard power plant, which is
not included in all ship designs - the Express Boat comes to mind). Thus
the need for large quantities of jump fuel.

	So what gives? Why can\'t an antimatter plant be used to charge the
capacitor banks, particularly at high tech levels?

	If I\'m missing something (it wouldn\'t be the first time...) would
somebody clue me in?

	Debit cards ... the bank balance is stored on the card.  Could be
	interesting for a character with forgery 5.

In TML Archive Message 258, Fred Schiff (vu0141@bingvax.cc.binghamton.edu) asks:

>This is a two part question:
>a) is there any semi-automatic way for generating xboat and other
>   routes from the information on a sector map?
This has always been an Eye-ball method for me.  There are a lot of criteria
that can go into calculating the most strategic location.  Given the following
sub-sector:


       A                     B                 A
       O                     O                 O
    System A             System C          System E
       A                     B
       O                     O
    System B             System D

System A   A___8__-D Scout and Navy Bases and Gas Giant
System B   A___9__-E Navy Base and Gas Giant
System C   B___5__-A
System D   B__09__-B
System E   _________ First Hub for the X-Boat Route

If you say link all A & B within Jump-3 or Jump-4, Then there will be two
X-Boat routes from system E to System C and D.  This is impractical.  Further,
using the same criteria, there would be six X-Boat routes between A, B, C, and
D.  (A to B, A to D, A to C, B to C, B to D, C to D).  You have to include
other factors.  For instance, System D would probably not be on an X-Boat route
be because there is no natural fuel in the system, even though it is a higher
tech level and higher population world than System C.  They would use couriers
to relay information to system D.  System\'s A and B are about equal in bidding
for the X-Boat Route.  The main consideration here would be what was beyond the
two.  Is the next concetration of worlds coreward or rimward? Etc.  If they are
the last two systems to get an X-Boat Route, then System A would get the nod
because of the Scout and Navy base.

Things to consider:
1) Star Port (More ships visit to dissminate mail)
2) Population (More people receiving messages)
3) Tech Level (Better message processing facilities)
4) Scout Base (Repair facilities etc., lots of Scout/Couriers)
5) Navy Base (Heavy X-Boat Mail user)
6) Natural Fuel (Gas Giant, Water) (Helps curb fuel costs)
7) Where am I going to next?

>b) given a text file with the sector or subsector information, what is
>   a good format to store the xboat route information? (I am thinking
>   of a text database format to be compatible with that used for sectors)
Well, what you could do is use a format like

0101 System Name   A123456-7 BTrade Codes    A701ImStar1 Star2 Star3 0202
                                                                     ^
                                                  XBoat Companion ----+

>Also what about the other routes?  The xboat routes are the Jump-4 routes

There are six basic routes left to set up:
a) Scout/Courier Mail Routes
b) MegaCorp Trade Routes
c) Sector Trade Routes
d) Sub-Sector Trade Routes
e) Fledgling Trade Routes
f) Free Trader Routes

Scout Mail routes will STAR out from Xboat routes, preferably at Jump-2
intervals.  Mail can be carried from those worlds by fitted traders on jump-1
ships.

MegaCorp routes are going to jump to worlds that are going to make the most
money.  Sector routes are going to work the same.  Subsector trading companies
will visit some of the less profitable worlds where as fledgling and free
traders will visit them more.  The competiton at high tech, high pop rich
worlds will be too high for the smaller lines to even have a chance.  I don\'t
think that GDW set these up for two reasons, first it would clutter the maps
and second there are too many variables.

  weeks.

2)  Spring Break -- mine is 3-17 to 3-25, I\'m not going anywhere, so I\'ll 
   accept responses during that time.  If you are going to be away, just tell

3)  Erekosse went to the bridge to do a System Check, and is no longer in the
   common room.

*******************************************************************************
			   PLAYERS\' MOVE
*******************************************************************************

	"Where did you get that?"  says Moe.  "That\'s evidence, and you have
no right to remove it.  I demand you turn it over to me right now."  He goes
to get up, but Steve stands up also, Moe sees this, and sits back down.
	"First off buddy," starts the captain, "I can confiscate whatever I 
want, whenever I want.  And you can\'t demand anything from me.  So relax, I\'ll
have Erekosse check it out when he\'s done with the computer check."
	It\'s obvious that Moe is getting quite upset with the situation, and
says, "As a Imperial Agent, Captain, I am ordering you to hand that computer
over to me now."
	"Why?"
	"Becuase you might accidentally .. um tamper with it, and um ...", he
is looking nervous.
	"Let\'s see what\'s on it, shall we," says the captain as he begins to 
type on the mini keypad.
	"No!" screams Moe as he leaps for the Captain.  Steve\'s was caught
off guard, and his reaction is slow, but not slow enough to collide with Moe
before he hit the Captain.  
	Erc jumps out of his chair, and goes to help.  Samantha has her gun 
out.  Steve gets a wrist lock on Moe, and tries to make him submit, but Moe
is fighting like a bear, and with a sharp blow to the Steve\'s abdomen, he breaks
the hold.  Moe tries a kick to the midsection, but Steve is a bit faster, and 
blocks it with his right arm.  Erc jumps in with a right cross to Moe\'s jaw.
Moe responds with anouther low kick, not for the abdomen, for the balls.  Erc
is quite stunned, and falls to the floor.  Steve gets a round-house in as Moe 
finished his kick, and drops him.  Steve turns to the captain and says, "Are you
alright sir?"
	"Watch out," screams Samantha, as she fires her Snub-Pistol.  Steve 
ducked, and she hit Moe square in the chest, the tranq round does it\'s job.
"Jesus," exclaims Steve, "that guy is tough.  What\'s the dosage?" to Samantha.
	"He\'ll be out for a couple of hours.  Next time make sure they\'re down!"
	"Right.  How you feeling big-guy?"  Steve says to Erc, as he helps him
off the floor.
	"Lemon-sucking mongrel, kicked me in the balls!  How am I supposed to
feel?"
	"You\'ll be fine," says Samantha, "just put some ice on it."  That gets
a chuckle out of everyone, except Erc.
	"Walk it off, you\'ll be okay.  I\'ll remove this mess sir," Steve says
to the Captain.
	"Go right ahead."
	"My pleasure."  Steve grabs Moe by the feet, and drags him down the hall
with Samantha following.  He drags him into the stateroom, and then locks the
door.  

	"Well I think it\'s time to get some work done, eh boys and girls,"  says
the captain.  "Samantha, find out what\'s on this thing," he hands the computer
to her.  "Erc and I will go back downstairs and see what\'s inside that crate.  
Steve, I want you here, no one comes out of there rooms, without my permission,
comprende?"
	"Got it."
	"Okay people ...."
	The intercom whistles, and Erekosse\'s voice is heard, "Captain?"
	Captain Moray walks over (it\'s located next to the door adjacent to the
stairs), and says "What is it?"
	"Ummm, you better get down here, you gotta read this for yourself.  
Nothing is really wrong, just that you better see this."
	"Okay I\'ll be right down.  Also Steve, help Samantha, when she\'s done,
look through this ledger (he puts it on the table) I picked it up in Moe and
Curly\'s room.  Well let\'s move like we got a purpose."
	(Aside to Erc) "I\'ve always wanted to say that," as they head 
downstairs.

	Samantha spends time scanning through the computer memory, and 
thier seems to be nothing of interest.  Most of the data files are business
addresses of companies, and the names of contact persons.  Also there are some
comm-line numbers and one strange entry, it reads:

		Binary -- 8AC23D	

Also, after looking further, you find one bank transaction, it reads:

	ACCT #:  xx42-8900PZ12    Balance:  35,972 Cr
	Transfer to:  PTP-SA-62   Amount:  26,000 Cr
	Date: 130-1117 

	
	Steve looks through the book, and finds nothing really of interest, 
it contains junk actually, and reading it carefully he discovers that after the
first 5 pages, the book starts repeating itself, it\'s like the same 5 pages
reprinted 50 times.

*******************************************************************************
			     CREWS\' MOVE
*******************************************************************************

	The Captain and Erc enter the bridge, Erekosse is sitting at a HUD
unit, and there is a serious look on his face.  "What\'s up?" 
	"Well Jordan, I was looking through the files, because I couldn\'t 
remember if I had started the Anti-Hijacking program or not, and well it took
a while, and I discovered nothing was wrong, except that the library was messed
up a bit, seems that a \'door\' was put in the library, so if it was asked to find
IBI badge #\'s it would print up the data that Samantha read.  Also, when I 
brought down the Anti-Hijacking program this appeared."  He gets up and lets the
Captain sit down.  There is a message on the screen, it reads:

		     I\'m sorry I did this, messing up the library,
		but they said if I didn\'t they\'d kill us.  They
		said they were taking over, and if we helped they\'d
		let us live.  I hope this gives you fair warning.
		I\'m not leaving my stateroom till you say it\'s okay.

				--Charlie

	"Did you get rid of the \'door\'?"
	"Yup."
	"Okay, I\'m going to go with Erc, and we\'re going to open that crate. 
You get upstairs and watch with Steve, let\'s not let this get any more out of 
hand than it already is."
	"Okay, I\'m on it."

	"Let\'s go Erc, it\'s time we see what they are really transporting."

	Erc and the Captain, enter the cargo hold.  They pick up a floater and
the tool kits and walk over to the crate.  Erc says, "I heard this humming sound
coming from the crate, I don\'t hear it now, but I think it was coming from the 
top of it.  I\'ll use the floater to to go up and look."
	"Okay, but wait, I do have two of them."  He goes and gets the second
floater.  (NOTE:  A floater is a disk, about 3\' in diameter, it uses anti-grav
plates to lift a max of 250 kg, to a max height of 10m.  Tech: 14, your modern
day step ladder.)
	Both the captain and Erc move to the top of the crate, there is writing
on the top of the crate, that says: THIS END UP, DO NOT BLOCK, with arrows point
ing to a 2\' x 2\' square on the crate.  It looks quite like a ventilation duct,
but it appears to be closed.  There is also a panel, with a hinge on it, and 
Erc looks to the Captain for the okay, and when he give it, open the panel,
very carefully.  Inside the panel it a display unit, there are 6 buttons that
aren\'t depressed.  There are also 6 lights, next to the buttons, there are all 
green, and glowing brightly.  The video unit is on, but the screen is blank.
	"You ever seen anything like this," says the Captain to Erc.
	"No, but I think I know how to find out."
	"How?"
	"Push this button," he says as he points to one button all by itself,
seperate from the rest.
	"Okay, you push it," says the captain.
	"I\'m not gonna push it, you push it."
	"No way Jose, I\'m not pushing it, it was your idea, you push it."
	"I\'m not gonna be held responsible if I blow up your ship captain, so
I think YOU better push it."
	"Hmmm, I see your point, okay I\'ll push it."  The captain depresses the
button very lightly, and after it is totally in, the screen comes to life.  Data
appears, and then some charts, and other sets of numbers.  The screen stops 
flushing data, and says:  SYSTEMS NORMAL
			  AIR -- GOOD
			  MATTER -- GOOD
			  SEAL -- SAFE
			  ENV -- SAFE
			  VITAL SIGNS -- GOOD

	"Uh, does this mean what I think it means," says Erc to the Captain.
	"Are you thinking what I\'m thinking."
	Erc nods his head yes, and says, "Somethings alive in there," pointing
to the crate.
	"I\'m getting to old for this shit," mutters the captain.

Banking depends upon reliable information.  Interstellar information is
limited by the speed of Jump, effectively introducing lag times upwards of
one week.

The result?  Instant banking is not allowed across interstellar systems.
Would-be entrepreneurs have three options:

* carry suitable currency with them

* barter

* wait for letters of credit to be registered

The first two solutions are obvious, and not particularly efficient.
However, they are often the only choices available, especially in a system
that is not within the political sphere of the entrepreneur\'s bank.

Letters of credit are more convenient, but can only operate under
well-ordered economic and political systems that span more than one system.
The letter of credit is exactly that: an official transfer of credit from
the banking system of one world to that of another.  To work, the
entrepreneur presents the letter to a bank that has a trade agreement with
his home bank.  Upon authentication of the letter, the entreprenuer is
credited with a certain sum (indicated on the letter).  The foreign bank
trusts that the home bank will credit its (the foreign bank\'s) account with
this same sum.  Occasionally, actual coinage will be shipped between worlds
to even out any net inbalance of trade.

Of course, letters of credit will be closely inspected for evidence of
forgery.  In fact, many banks will insist that the letters are delivered by
official agents of the Imperium through standard X-boat channels.  Some
banks may require confirmation (particularly for large transfers) from the
home bank ---- resulting in long delays while inquiries are sent back and
forth.  Entrepreneurs may be held up for months while credit is "in
transfer."

No wonder the economy is so fragmented.

This is not offical, but I do have a reasonable quick fix.

By using the fuel consumption at TL9, it can be calculated
that you need about 125 MW per jump unit during the 7 day
voyage (actually, it\'s about 133, but 125 is a more convient
figure).  This DOES give ships additional range at higher
tech level (or more space for cargo, etc).  I don\'t think
it does unbalance the game.  However, if you are using 
antimatter, you will have a super ship no one can catch up
with.  I suggest  you boost up the price of antimatter
up to elimiate the abuse.

As for cluttering the maps, I have a suggestion...

Print up your hex maps on standard forms (like use postscript to a laser
printer).  Keep all the basic world information that you would see on a
GDW map on the first map.  Then prepare overlay maps that just have the
trade/xboat routes, and no world information, printed on them.  Turn
these into trasnparencies.

Now all you have to do is overlay one or two sets of transparencies at a
time, to see the routes you\'re really interested in.  If you keep the
maps in a three-ring binder, you\'re really in business.

	[At TL 17 (or beyond, perhaps), why is there no antimatter powered

certainly design a TL 17+ starship with antimatter instead of fusion plants,
(p 64 of Ref\'s Manual)

	[If I\'m missing something] You\'re missing something.

	[Reading the Traveller rules and supplements leads me to believe
that starship jump drives are powered directly by large capacitor banks]

No. The "jump drive" (which is not of course a "drive"--it is not an engine)
is simply a very large fusion plant which uses up its fuel very quickly
because the jump uses a lot of energy which must be supplied in a very short
amount of time with no power fluctuations. (which is why you risk mis-jump if
you use unrefined fuel on a ship not equipped to use it)

The energy is shunted through these crystals (name escapes me) which puts the
energy into a grid which is around the hull of the starship.  That grid is
more properly what is responsible for jump, but since you only see it when
the ship enters or leaves jump space its easier for the spacers to just point
to the fusion plant and say "thats the jump drive" to the tourists, even though
everybody with a little experience knows thats not what it is.

I got that from Digest Group\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual which explains
(probably for the first time) the rational for the various technologies
in Traveler.

[energy absorbed by black globe screens,] - nope.  You can\'t use this energy.
It goes into the crystals and must be discharged before you want to jump. If
the crystals absorbs the total amount of energy they are able to you must turn
off the black globe or the energy which it absorbs will go elsewhere rather
than into the jump capacitors (ie. you FRY!!)  This has struck me as a strange
method of getting rid of the energy from the black globe, but then again it is
an experimental weapon and the naval engineers had to put all that energy 
*somewhere*.

In Archive-Message-Number: 263 Rob Miracle says
Well, what you could do is use a format like

0101 System Name   A123456-7 BTrade Codes    A701ImStar1 Star2 Star3 0202
                                                                     ^
                                                  XBoat Companion ----+

This wasn\'t exactly what I had in mind.  This does not in fact tell me
where the routes are.  Also, I don\'t think that the format that GDW uses
for the Spinward Marches is quite appropriate. (For one thing you don\'t
need the stars necessarily, for another its cramped.)

I had more in mind 3 files for each sector:
  name.sector (mainworld generated sector info)
  name.xboats (xboats routes in sector name)
  name.extend (additional info on worlds I\'m interested in)

I\'m not quite sure what the last would have in it, but if would at
least have the names of the subsectors; I\'d like to have them somewhere.

The sector file would have lines like:
Wunderland         2140 C130110-8   Lo Ni Po De     615 IM  

I adopted this from the way Digest Group lists worlds in Traveller\'s
Digest.  Name first, then location, zone at end after alignment. The
trade classifications can also hold additional info, including Xb, for
an Xboat station.  Then the xboats file will have the info on the graph
which is the route.

The question is how to store that graph.

I made some changes on the gensec program James Perkins wrote which I found in
the archives. I made it compatible with MegaTraveller. It was the base for my
musing about how to do the X-boat routes.

It looks like this:
% gensec nonsense
usage: gensec {-S | density | maturity}
  Generates Traveler sector or subsector.

  S = {A..P}, subsector to generate
  density = generation percentage or rift|sparse|scattered|dense
  maturity = backwater|frontier|mature|cluster
  defaults are entire sector, 50% stellar density, standard frontier maturity.

% gensec -L rift backwater

Someone in the last few days asked about shipping grain today.  Well I\'m not
sure about ships (But I suppect that it\'s the same as trucks.)  Anyway, the
reason that you don\'t see trucks on fire at the side of the roadway because
they are loaded with grain is the trucks are vented.  Normaly they are open
top container trucks w/ a tarp over the top.  

Railways do the same thing.  As far as ships.  It\'s either open top or a
ship is big enough to have a fancy AC that cleans the dust out.  The fancy
AC is how grain silos do it.  And you do hear about silos blowing up every
once in a while.  

Now then how to do it in Travler.  My way ingore it.  If as a GM I had to
make a ruling on it.  It\'s in sealed containers (Most likly vacuum packed.
This has the added benifit of volume reduction.)

In Archive-Message-Number: 257, Adrian Hurt <adrian@cs.hw.ac.uk> says

>I\'d go for vacuum, on the grounds that if the ship gets attacked, the cargo

>risk explosive decompression, that is.

	Actually, one of the reasons for listing special shipping 
considerations is this situation.  If you\'ve got a vacuum-sensitive
cargo, you have to take damage to it into account before depressurising
the ship.  If you\'ve got a load of explosive material, you probably want
to think twice before fighting the pirates at all.  If 60 tons of frozen
gourmet dinners are thawing in the hold, that temporary powerplant
malfunction is a lot more serious.  The whole idea is to add a little
variety and role-playing to the otherwise rather boring cycle of
buy-jump-sell-buy-jump-sell.  A side benefit for the referee is it also
gives you a legitimate way to cut into the players profits if the game
gets out of hand.  It\'s tough (for me) to run a campaign where all the
players are worth millions.  Losing a cargo occasionally can help
prevent this.

	Another problem I see with a trade-centered campaign is that most
of the players don\'t get to do anything.  Now that I\'m running
MegaTraveller, I\'ve got something for the engineer(s) to do (check the
rules for entering jump drive under the Engineer skill in the Player\'s
Manual), but what about everyone else.  Once my NPC generator is
completed, I can generate NPC passengers, and let the purser assign the
staterooms.  This will also make it a little less obvious when I slip in
a prepared NPC encounter.  I\'m also considering, since I have 15mm scale
floor plans for their ship, to each time they prepare to leave port,
hand them scale cargo containers and let them arrange the cargo bay.
That way I can make use of a corrollary (sp?) of Murphy\'s Law - the
freight loaded furthest from the door belongs to the man who needs it
first.  Does any one have any further ideas?

	Getting back to my original posting, is anyone interested in 
revamping the speculative trade system?  I\'ve got a few entries into my
master cargo table ready.  If there is enough interest, I\'ll send them
to this list.  If not, I\'ll be happy to send them directly to anyone who
wants them.

Yes, there\'s a lot of interest already, judging from postings on the
list.  I\'m interested, too, in contributing.  I think all it needs is
someone to volunteer to lead the discussion.  We need a VOLUNTEER.

An ideal format would be for the topic coordinator to come up with an
initial explanation of a rough strategy.  Then collect responses on it,
produce a digest of the responses and an amended strategy.  Iterate
until half-baked ideas become fully baked.  Naturally these
digests/strategy reports are posted to the whole list; individual
discussion can go directly to the topic coordinator.

This list can really contribute to Traveller, all it takes is some
commitment.  I think the level of commitment and quality is way up
lately.  Thanks everyone for a great effort.  Thanks to the listeners
that lend support by their presence.

I realize we\'re all really busy, but all it takes is a commitment from
one person to handle and synthesize the responses, and we all benefit.
I\'m doing as much as I can coordinating this list.  If you\'re fired up
about Traveller, and can spare the time (it does take time), and have
some organization skills, this can really contribute to the quality of
the game.  I really want to see some of this discussion result in
something (maybe of quality good enough for publishing!).

Topics needing coordinators:

	Star system generation/database management
	Trade route generation/database management
	MT/Merchant Prince Trade and Commerce System replacement
	Others?

On another topic, I think I\'ve gotten all the response I\'ve gotten on
changing the mailing list to a digest format.  The results were:

	Yes!	Yes,but	No,but	No!	News
	7	5	1	4	1

	Average delay between digests: 3 days

One listee was interested in starting a newsgroup, rec.games.traveller.
I\'d say yes! Except... we need 150 members and at least 2 messages/day
for 6 months to accomplish this, according to Gene Spafford (News Guru
Extraordinaire of our humble planet).  We currently have 142 members,
and have had a (phenomenal!) 51 messages this month.  Almost, but not
quite.  I also am uncertain if we will sustain this level of traffic.

One member suggested we move to a dual list, where people desiring to be
put on a digest list could have that, while people liking the current
mechanism could stick with it.  Aside from added complexity, this is my
favorite idea.

Someone else wanted digests, and suggested that we all agree on certain
number of subtopics, and then have everyone carefully place the subtopic
in their Subject: line.  People could then easily skip messages that
way.  Two problems with this; one is, people are never that careful.
That causes problem #2, I have to adjust subjects on every piece of mail
going through the list.

One person really liked the "instant delivery" of the current mechanism,
because if he had a question it could get answered very quickly.

Several people seemed to pick up a concern about peak hours mail
overload at my computer.  This has not been a problem, so rest asssured.

When I find time, what I will do is this:

	I will follow contacts to get some digestifying software.

	I will implement a dual list with digestifying for those who
	want it, or the standard method.  Once it is tested, I will make
	it known and those who want their mail digested can get it that
	way; everyone else can stay the way they are.  This "voting with
	your feet" will really indicate how desired digestifying is, and
	may make the traffic more acceptable to people.

	The Traveller Archives will still be organized as it currently
	is, with Archive-Message-Numbers, Bundles, and Packages.

- ----

By the way, it\'s much easier for me to distribute archive bundles now,
send archive tables-of-contents and add people to the list... a little
tool work often really pays off.  Don\'t be shy if you want some old
archives.

- ----

Oh yes, the UUCP-style address tektronix!dadla!jamesp no longer works,
because tektronix insists you use the full name for dadla.  Those of you
still using uucp, route through tektronix!dadla.la.tek.com!jamesp, or if
possible, ask if domain-style adressing will work at your site, and use
jamesp@dadla.la.tek.com.  The same goes for the "traveller" and
"traveller-request" mailboxes.

There will be a new MegaTraveller-compatible gensec sector generator and
mapsub subsector mapper program coming out soon, due to the hard work of
Fred Schiff.  Stay tuned to this channel.

Game Designers\' Workshop has an account on the Delphi system.  This is
a commercial on-line service.  The account name is MARCMILLER.  I don\'t
know if Marc Miller or anyone from GDW has used the system since Digest
Group Publications dropped their support of the RPG area of this service.

DGP used to be major presence in the RPG area of Delphi.  They have
uploaded a megabyte or so of Official Traveller material.  Digest Group 
used to play test upcoming Traveller releases on line.  They would
carry on frequent dialogs on the topic of Traveller.  As they left
Delphi, they said that they may be moving to the GEnie system.  I have 
no idea if they have done this or not.  This is a current list of what 
is stored in their archive on Delphi as of 4/1/89:

Does this mean that if the ship sustains so much as one hit, it can\'t jump?

Ah yes. These fellows also think gauss guns are silent. Which they are, if they
fire projectiles at subsonic velocities, and so have penetration comparable to
airguns - or if they fire in vacuum, in which case anything is silent.

>[energy absorbed by black globe screens,] - nope.  You can\'t use this energy.

Yep. You can use this energy. At least, according to High Guard, which I quote:
"If a ship absorbs enough energy to make a jump, and is supplied with
sufficient fuel, it may jump at the end of the turn."

Any energy absorbed by the black globe goes into the ship\'s capacitors. These
are usually the jump capacitors, which mass .5% * Jump no. * ship\'s mass. You
can install additional capacitors if you wish.

Energy absorbed by the capacitors may only leave the ship while the globe is
off. The globe may be "flickered" to permit this. The energy may be used in
addition to, or instead of, energy from the ship\'s power plant.

You may also switch on the black globe during jump, so that you enter the
destination system with the globe on. This makes you invisible. By arranging
your velocity carefully before jumping, you can drift up to the main world,
drop the globe and give the world a nice surprise (like a nuclear missile).
This tactic also comes straight from "High Guard", and also appears in the
board game "Fifth Frontier War". (What happened to the PBM, by the way?)

Just a suggestion.  Just because you\'re running a trade-centered
campaign doesn\'t mean it has to be in some docile, well-established
trading environment.  Give it a little bit of an adversarial edge,
maybe a lot of one.  Adversaries could include rival traders trying
to establish or keep the route for their own profit (both small-scale
operations and mega-corps who are for all practical purposes above
the law -- especially in the shattered imperium), pirates,  navies
of various political factions trying to disrupt enemy trade and
supply lines,  local politicians on various planets who might
not WANT outside trade (remember what political power the traders 
wielded in the early parts of Asimov\'s Foundation series??),  law 
enforcement agencies (let\'s face it, some laws are just not 
economically practical!!),  technological problems  (how does
one transport four megatons of ice to a desert world, especially
with a fleet of jump-1 ships on a route that frequently has four-parsec
gaps in it??),  logistical problems, even adversaries from the
inside who are unhappy with the way the company is run and want
to either shut it down or usurp control of it.  Furthermore, any
company that manages to be successful under these conditions is
going to attract the attention of major political powers and
become embroiled in universal politics, like it or not. I\'m sure you can
add many more of your own ideas.  The point is that in an
environment as unstable as the shattered imperium,  there\'s going
to be a lot more to worry about than where to put the cargo.
("Ensign, retrieve Baron Von Aushter\'s cargo from the bay, and
what was that you said about being boarded?...")

Happy gaming!

In regards to whether anyone at GDW reads this list, the answer is no.
(In fact I don\'t recall seeing any Bloomington/Normal addresses on the net).
That doesn\'t mean that they might not see hardcopy of some/all of the messages.
They also don\'t have an e-mail address or any means of getting input
electronically except via diskette (at least according to the latest
submission guide).  They are after all a small company and not involved
with computers more than most non-tech businesses.  There are several
people, such as myself, who are good friends of members of the company who
do read this mailing list or net news, so they are not completely isolated

The Jump "Drive" is a very high-power fusion plant which charges the
"Zuchai Crystal Energy Sink Array".  These crystals fortunately are the
only devices capable of storing the great energy quanties needed for
jump.  Also, they have a "memory" of the energy as it was placed in
them; this allows discharging at the same rate as charging, but also
makes them prone to input power fluctuations.  The electrical energy
from these is then gated into the "Lanthanum Hull Net", in a peculiar
ordering of segments, which is controlled by the "Jump Governor".  The
Hull Net is first "warmed up", with about 20% of the stored energy, and
then strongly energized by the crystal\'s energy to rend the orientation
of the ship in the multispace and transition it into the alternate jump
dimension.

The hull net remains energized at a low level throughout the trip to
maintain a little pocket of "our" universe around the ship.  Should
there be a hole in the net, a finger of the jumpsace will poke into the
ship.  Should much of the net be destroyed prior to jump, it would not
be possible to achieve the initial insertion into jumpspace, and no jump
would have taken place.

Actually, wouldn\'t they be about as silent as a pistol with a silencer?  The
only noise is from the round flying through the air; there is none of the
"report" due to the hot gasses escaping from the end of the muzzle at high
pressure.

> Yep. You can use this energy. At least, according to High Guard, which I

The Starship book doesn\'t mention anything about Black Globes or
alternative charging methods in the Jump Drive chapter.  I haven\'t
completed the Weapons and Defenses chapter yet, so I don\'t know if the
practice is reported there.  Given the technology reported in the book,
it would seem *possible* to gate energy from the Black Globe (if it can
be issued in an even stream of sufficient quantity) into the Crystals.
In practice, this would seem risky by the new technological explanation.

A related example, unrefined fuel can occasionally cause the Jump
Drive\'s Fusion plant to hiccup, causing a dip or surge in output.  This
dip or surge is stored in the Crystals and cannot always be detected
(strange...) or compensated by the Jump Governor when the Ship is
transitioning into jumpspace.  Result -- misjump! With possible system
damage, temporal or spatial displacement.

Get this book.  It\'s fun for people interested in Technology and
Engineering.  On the other hand, it\'s probably a little too technical
for people who rarely wonder why things work.

Talking about extra capacitors, anyone ever design a ship which has
piles of extra capacitors? I designed some ships which would burn the
reserve capacitor energy to feed infrequently-used things like weaponry
and active defenses.  This allowed my power plant\'s excess capacity to
be burned on needed agility to run away.  The ships may not have had
much stamina, but boy could they evade! By the explanation given of
Zuchai Crystals, they will break down after 2-3 hours of storing charge,
so a less-dense method of charge storage would now have to be selected
for this design strategy to work.

Well, the Traveller vs. Megatraveller results are in. And the winner is...
                   MegaTraveller (which won [grudgingly])

I didn\'t receive as many comments as I expected (only 11). I don\'t know 
whether (Mega)Traveller is a dying FRP, people prefer other FRPs to them, 
or something else entirely, but here are the results. If anyone else out 
in netland has additional comments, please email them to me and I\'ll post 
a follow-up.

By the way, I reviewed the MegaTraveller Players Manual and Referees Guide 
this weekend (not as long as I would have liked -- my wife was getting tired 
of waiting for me at the gaming store). I\'ll post my review at the end of 
the article along with my summary of the replies to the postings I
received.

The following are a few of the comments I received about who preferred what 
and why. Any elipses (...) indicate editting on my part.

SUMMARY: Every message I received was in favor of MegaTraveller, though
most were grudgingly so. MegaTraveller\'s strong points were its skills
(specifically, the task system), starship generation, and (the most
commonly stated reason) the fact that everything is now in one place.
The most commonly stated problems was the errata, lack of a good trade
system, and poor personal and starship combat systems. Other than that, 
both systems are said to be the same. Most of those who replied who were 
referees said that they used a derived combat system (such as STRIKER for 
personnel and Azhanti High Lightning or STARSHIP for ships). The only
thing that people were \'impressed\' with was the implementation of the
task system which, if used well, can improve the playability of the game
(see uabmap01@asnuab.asn.net above).  So, there is a lot of room for 
improvement either way you go. 

REVIEW of MegaTraveller: Even though _all_ of the replies were in favor
of MegaTraveller, the number of problems and complaints should tell you
something. According to the impression I got from the replies I received
and my glance through the MegaTraveller books, get it if you want every
thing in one place. I personally intend to stick with the old Traveller
system (I put a lot of work into it), but I will probably adapt a task 
system for it. Also, I liked the level of detail used for MegaTraveller 
starship construction. The main things that I didn\'t like about
MegaTraveller was the layout of the books (all of the tables looked
jumbled on the pages). The books weren\'t organized well, and to para-
phrase a reply, whoever did the page layout and proofing should be shot.
Also, I didn\'t like the idea of interruptions during combat (eg. I\'m
going to tell a guy that\'s about to unload a Gauss rifle on me to "Hold
it!"?). In campaigns I\'ve been in there are two types of characters, the
quick (of mind _and_ body) and the dead. Also, I didn\'t like the setting
of MegaTraveller, but that doesn\'t really matter since any referee will
do what s/he pleases (mine started 2 years before the 5th Frontier
War). In my opinion, both systems are outlines (rather than rules) to be
tailored by the referee. Unfortunately, this means finding or creating
two combat systems (personal and ship) since the ones supplied are
inadequate. This also seemed to be the general consesus of those who
replied. If we wat to take a poll on the more popular personal and
starship combat systems, let me know and we\'ll see what we can do (I use
STRIKER for personal and STARSHIP [modified HIGH GUARD] for ship).

If I have to buy MegaTraveller to accomplish what I want to do, so be 
it (like I said, grudgingly). Have fun gaming.

Anybody know where I can get some good deck plans to ships like a Patrol Cruiser
and other ships mentioned in the Traveller Supplement, Fighting Ships, I think
it\'s #9.  Anybody got them online?  If you have them online, could you mail them
to me.  It would be much appreciated.

[Forwarded from rec.games.frp for your enjoyment... thought it might inspire
some hacking... now if I only understood Postscript well enough to make a
mapsub program that produced postscript output... -- James]

Here is a short Postscript program some of you may find useful!
Sorry about the last one, this is not not copyright protected by
Prime, but is fully distributable.  Sorry about any gripes this may
have caused!

%
%   Although, a lot neater and with the hexes lining up better!
%
% Abnormal conditions:
%
%   None that I know of, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t any.  I have not
%   tried to use non-integer fill or scale values, nor did I see the need
%   to produce such sheets, therefore this program may blow up if you try
%   to do so.
%
% Implementation:
%
%   Standard Adobe Postscript.  This does not include any set-up code required
%   by your printer (our spooler handles this stuff).
%
%   Basically, the FILL variable defines how many small hexes can fit from
%   side to side in the large hexes.  In the above example, the FILL would
%   be about 3 (it looks like 3.5).  The FILL variable should be an integer
%   value (2+).
%
%   The SCALE variable determines how many strips of large hexes are to be
%   printed.  The above example is SCALE = 1.  A SCALE of 2 would print 4
%   rows of big hexes instead of just 2.
%
%   YMAX and XMAX are set to the paper size in points (72 pt per inch).
%   If your printer uses larger paper, these should be changed.  Current
%   settings reflect 8.5x11 paper.
%
%==============================================================================
%   NOTES:
%
%   This program can be used to create simple hex paper as well as
%   hex-within-hex paper.  Simply use a FILL value of 1.
%
%   Usefull settings:
%      FILL 10, SCALE 2+: Tactical maps for 2300ad or Space: 1889
%      FILL 20, SCALE 1:  AD&D, 20 mile per hex maps.
%      FILL 1, SCALE 1+:  Single hex layer hex sheets.
%      FILL 1, SCALE 8:   ~15mm hexes

/*
 * mapsub - produce a subsector hex-grid map from subsector data
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   mapsub <Subsector.dat >Subsector.hex
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   Mapsub processes the star system information on the standard input and
 *   produces a hex-grid map on the standard output.  The format expected is
 *   very precise, consisting of one formatted line for each system, each
 *   exactly 59 bytes followed by a newline.  Example:
 *
 *   "0102 Gruenwald          B775400-9 N TN NI           TI   GP"
 *
 *    XXYY System_Name_______ UPP______ B Trade_Codes___  Al Z GP
 *
 *   Where:
 *	XXYY is the system coordinates, in the range 0101-3240
 *	System_Name is the 18-character system name
 *	UPP is the Universal Planetary profile
 *	B is the base code: \'N\' navy, \'S\' scout, \'A\' both
 *	Trade_Codes is up to fifteen characters worth of Trading codes,
 *	   from this list: TN (Terran-Norm), TP (Terran-Prime), AG
 *	   (Agricultural), NA (Non-AG), IN (Industrial), NI (Non-IN), RI
 *	   (Rich), PO (Poor), WA (Water world), DE (Desert World), VA
 *	   (Vacuum World), AS (Asteroid Belt), IC (Ice-capped), CA (Subsector
 *	   Capitol)
 *	   The only Trade_Code that does anything is CA, which causes
 *	   "Capitol" to be written into the system\'s hex.
 *	Al is the system alignment.  "IM" is the official alignment for the
 *	   Imperium.  I use "IN" for independent worlds.
 *	Z is the travel zone, either " " (Green), "A" (Amber), "R" (Red).
 *	G is the gas-giant-present flag, either " " (None), or "G" (exists).
 *	P is the planetoids-present flag, either " " (None), or "P" (exists).
 *
 *   The output is an array of empty and filled hexes, which look like this:
 *	   ______
 *	  / XXYY \\	XXYY - System coordinates
 *	 /  * S   \\	* - Navy base, S - Starport class
 *	/  ^ O .   \\	^ - Scout base, "O" "@" or "%" - Desert or Non-desert
 *	\\  System  /        world or Asteroid belt, . - Gas giant
 *	 \\  Name  /
 *        \\Zone__/	Zone - blank for green or circle for "amber" or
 *                             filled circle for "RED"
 *
 * WARNING
 *    Mapsub assumes that the input is only one subsector\'s worth of worlds.
 *    if you give it a sector\'s worth of worlds (Example: "gensec | mapsub")
 *    it will print them all, overlapping many worlds!
 *
 *    Ergo, if you want to generate worlds automatically, use gensec to
 *    produce a sector file of systems, then glean all the worlds belonging
 *    to a particular sector out of that file and put it in a subsector file,
 *    then use mapsub on the new subsector file.
 *
 * TO COMPILE
 *    On BSD systems, use:	cc -O -s -o mapsub mapsub.c
 *    On SYSV systems, use:	cc -O -DSYSV -s -o mapsub mapsub.c
 *
 * FILES
 *    Needs a blank hex map template, defined by default to be "./subhex".
 *    Change the MAP_TEMPLATE parameter to change this file\'s location.
 *    
 * SEE ALSO
 *    gensec - the sector generator program (produces compatible format)
 *
 * AUTHOR
 *    James T. Perkins, jamesp@dadla.TEK.COM, tektronix!dadla!jamesp
 *    Yngve Larsson, yla@ida.liu.se, ..!enea!liuida!yla
 *
 * BUGS
 *    The code is somewhat messy, as it was hacked out on a whim.
 *    
 *    As stated above, one cannot simply use the output of gensec as input
 *    to mapsub -- the gensec output must be edited.

(Yes, the file is supposed to end like that. It will be appended by
the psmapsub routines.)

Notes: 
You might want to fiddle with the constants "topOfPageX" and "topOfPageY"
if you have anything other than A4 paper size. These are the distances
to the highest leftmost hex on the map, counted from bottom and left
side of the page respectively. You can also change the constant "unit", 
which is used as scaling factor throughout the program (except for fonts).


One important change is that James\' maps had each even column of hexes 
displaced upward. I believe GDW\'s maps displace these column downward, so
I changed this.

Enjoy (if it works.... :-)

When using the "st" system generator to make a postscript file
representing the system, everything seems to work: I get out of this a
file that appears to be postscript.  The system that we have that is
connected to a postscript printer is a Pyramid UNIX box.  The printer is
an Apple LaserWriter.  Usually, to print a postscript file, I type:

cat outputfile.ps > /dev/lw

I am told that if my file doesn\'t print, I am probably lacking a header
file that defines the functions used by the outputfile.ps program.  Is
this so? What type of header file do I need, and where can I get it?
Assuming it is fairly small, could someone send it to me?

I am not sure how automatic this is, or if it would work on files of sector
data, but...I\'ll see if I can remember the algorithm.
This is totally based on graph theory, so if you\'re not that interested, kill
it now.  Also, I have had only minimal graph theory, so if anyone catches
my errors, please post the corrections.

In any graph (vertices and edges) you can get a Minimal cost Spanning Tree by
the following algorithm:
  1. set up a table listing the edges and their cost (this can be cost in
           anything...i.e. time, number of jumps, length of jumps, etc.) in
           INCREASING order by cost.
  2. add to a separate list of edges, all edges whose addition would not create
           a cycle (i.e. the ability to go in circles  :-)

You now have a MST which includes all edges necessary to reach every system (or
some subset of every system, perhaps all A and B starports?  ).

Example:  if in a certain sector/subsector, you want to link all vertices in
    the following graph into an X-boat system,


                    A             the table for this subsector would look like:
                   1|\\ 6                 EDGE        COST
                 2  |  \\    5            ==================
               G---- B   C----D         A-B         1
               |    |   |6     |1        D-E         1
              6|    3\\  |      |         H-F         1

                        |                F-I         3
                        I                C-D         5

                                         G-H         6
                                         C-F         6

The MST table would look like:            The MST would look like:

                                                     I

This alorithm gives the minimal cost (in whatever we measure cost in, travel
time?) for the entire tree, NOT for any specific starting/ending vertices.
I.E. following the MST route from A to C would take a cost of 12 (A-B-F-E-D-C),
while going from A to C directly, by a non-MST route would only take a cost of
 6.  If thecost is measured in number of weeks in jump space this represents 50%
savings in travel time.  I haven\'t worked out the concept, but perhaps the
algorithm in this case (TRAVELLER x-boat routes) could be modified to allow
only 1 cycle per graph.
   Is there anyone out there with more graph theory who could tell us the
answer?  Obviously this is no longer an MST, but what is it?  Also, could
this algorithm be converted to use on a computer to automatically calculate
x-boat routes from a given sector/subsector data file?

   I\'ve already gone beyond my knowledge so I pass these questions along to
the list for answers.

Paul.

Subject: Welcome

Welcome to the TML Star System Digest.  A few weeks ago I asked if
someone on the list was interested in being "Topic Coordinator" for the
topic of Star System Database issues.  BILL MORRISON
(morrison@pyr.gatech.edu) jumped at the challenge and offered to be
Topic Coordinator for this issue.  Let\'s all give Bill a warm welcome
for offering to devote some of his free time to this task.

Bill will collect your input on the topic of Star System Databases,
their generation, storage, and display.  He will collect the letters,
edit them for brevity and clarity, and combine them into digests.  He
will then send the digests to the entire Traveller Mailing List.  He
will try to recommend areas where further discussion is needed and try
to bring the people offering discussion into agreement.

Those of you uninterested in the topic will be able to quickly recognize
and delete the digests, and your mail traffic will not be greatly
increased, due to the digesting.

The topic of star system generation, storage, and interchange has been a
hot topic.  The following is the first digest, which I have done for
Bill as an example.  I have also prepared the second digest, which
summarizes the correspondence in this note.  Bill will start collecting
your input for digest volume 3 immediately.

Again, thanks to Bill for the commitment!  With help like this we can
really get things accomplished.

Do "something", huh?  Are you like me and just SAY you\'re going to do
something, then never find time, or are you really going to DO something about
them :-).  (Just teasing you).

You have completely and totally flattered me on my coding style.  All those
programs were icky hacks.  Someone wrote me once and said, "can you covert
this program into Pascal?"  I had to write them back and tell them I couldn\'t,
for one I can\'t remember my Pascal anymore, for two I\'m so used to hacking
stuff with pointers and weak type checking that I didn\'t want to take the time
to think through the problem and design a solution.

And to think I get paid for producing maintainable, well-documented software.
Sheesh! :-)  At least I try to avoid "hacking" in my work software.

I agree with your ideas on approaches.  With either scheme, I get lost due to
the volume and multiple layers of detail inherent in the system
(galaxy/quadrant/sector/subsector/system/star/orbit/
planet-belt/moon/planet-map/region-map/local-map).

> Are there any programs about which deal with X-boat (& trade) routes?

None that I am aware of.  You could come up with some interesting algorithms
though.  One old, simple algorithm that came in the ORIGINAL Traveller boxed
set (I MEAN early editions) was as follows:

                        JUMP ROUTES

        World   ---- Jump  Distance ----

The idea is that you have to roll or exceed the indicated number on a D6
for a jump (aka trade) route to exist.

Apparently this chart did not survive revisions of the Traveller rules.
I found that it produced some interesting graphs, but did not work as
well when you changed the chance of system presence or the starport
class generation table -- either you got overrun with trade routes, or
areas became isolated too much.  I finally adopted use of this chart as
an indication, and would use its results with much adjustment.

Probably the best way to assign trade routes would be an adjustment of
the above chart including system density, starport likelihood, and
especially trade classes for the worlds (Agricultural-NonAgricultural
routes have higher likelihood, whereas Agricultural-Agricultural routes
have lower likelihood, and HiPop worlds have higher chance of
connectivity than LoPop worlds).

As for X-Boat routes I have no fully- or half-baked ideas.  As a
quarter-baked idea I\'d suggest developing an adaptive algorithm which
takes into account the locality of high-quality starports, subsector and
subsector capitols, scout bases, and the standard rules (like: Xboat
routes usually pass through major starports or within 4 parsecs) to
generate them.

Hmmm.  Maybe I should extract this and send it to the list to generate some
discussion...  what do you think?

Oh come on, all I haveto do is find a stupid C compiler when I go home
for Spring break on my father\'s PC. (Nice being a student, occasionaly
they let us leave the asylum.)  "One of these days..." One of these days
I\'m going to have to learn sufficient C to be confident with it. The
Traveller flow-charts have all these little DMs and using a stupid macro
would not have occurred to me. The differnce between a seasoned professional,
I imagine. (:-) The stargen program is long, has no comments and does use
those stupid damm pointers; your stuff is small and a least I can read the
stupid thing. Elegance. Ah, always elegenace. This is a hack?

Its nice to have lots of little programs all dealing with a text file
containing the sector info. But its sort of limited. Where do I put the
rooutes that ships go through. (Deciding which trade routes are reasoble
is a separate and less interesting problem actually--in the case of war
or invasion or genreral chaos I think I\'d just like to know *all* the
various routes through the star-lanes. Maybe the commerical ones don\'t
follow X-boats lines. Maybe thats important. etc) The sector and subsector
names aren\'t even listed. How do I deal with it when I want an extended
generation for a star system (I don\'t have too do that for every star, just
the ones I want to deal wwith) Last, how do the sectors fit together?
Certainly thats not a big problem, since you are only dealing with one at
a time usually, but wouldn\'t it be nice.

I have a copy of Traveler\'s Digest. (I mean the one published on Earth :-)
and they have these beautiful maps of subsectors showing bases and X-boat
routes and sector maps with the routes and star systems and capitals
diagrammed. Pretty. OK, no one needs this much. But it would be nice to
have this all in a database at me fingertips.

Umph. Could use grid files, but since the maps aren\'t really maps, but
diagrams of locations that might be wasteful. The routes could be done
in two files containing the edges and vertices of the graph. (Then you
could write "whats the fastest/most scenic route to Core" programs)
Each star system could have an optional text field for a paragraph of
info, optional extended, optional Grand Census/Grand Survey if more than
the UPP is needed. World maps would be separate, but its supposed to be

But you\'ve got to use pointers for anything complex, to get it to be

Paragraph of info?  Heck, I figure if someone wants to get verbose about

That\'s why I think you should be able to comment any sort of object (Sector,
Subsector, System, Star, Planet, Moon, Etc.)

Yeah, world maps would be optional, in fact I think you should be able
to fill stuff out from the top down.  Oh, you want to look at THIS
subsector? Quick... generate all the systems in it, stow it away.  And
you want to look at THIS system\'s extended generation stuff? Quick,
generate the expanded system data, stow it away.  Oh, a world map, QUICK,

Subject: Gensec and Mapsub
From: Fred Schiff

Hello. I\'m back.

I *did* do some work on your programs.  Basically I changed the output
format and made it compatible with Megatraveler.  Minor changes were
made in Mapsub; it prints CAPITOL if it finds the code \'Cx\' for a
sector capitol, and capitalizes the name if it is a \'Hi\' population
world.

More changes were made in Gensec.  Trade codes have the second letter lower
case, pop multiplier, gas giants and planetary belts appear as numbers.
Some of your code was not correct with the new rules (for example tech
codes go up to 20) and I found a genuine bug! It should be <= rather than
< in the percentage; in testing the program I was getting no systems with
a stellar density of 1%. (A feature, its a feature!) I changed the format
around a bit, putting the system name first.

I made some changes in the options.  I was going to allow you to specify that
you wanted a random name rather than "Unnamed" but couldn\'t decide if it was
necessary.  You can generate an entire sector or just a specified subsector.
And you can specify stellar density with a number (as before) or with the
words "rift", "dense" etc.  You can also with words specify the sector\'s
maturity (which alters the spaceport present)

Hacking C was kind of fun.  Pretty good for a guy without a C book! As I don\'t
have a C book and I took out your copywrite notice I\'m sending you the programs
to take a look over and then post. Just make sure you spell my name Rite! [sic]

I took a stab at the extended generation system.  I didn\'t finish because it is
a long program and I had work to do.  I somehow misplaced the file system.c (no
big deal, I can\'t stand these guys code). I\'ve taken out things which were not
in Megatraveller (I can only digest so much at a time) so albedo, surface temp.
etc. are all out.  I put in comments, re-wrote some of it a little nicer and
looked at the Ref Manual to make sure they were doing things correctly. I stole
your limit and DM macros because you should try to make programs easier to
understand rather than harder.  If I get back to this I\'ll send it over to you;
I have changed it so that it does not do mainworld generation. It takes a file
in the same format as mapsub (extracted from a sector file perhaps) and does
the extended processing on each mainworld.  At least thats how its supposed to
work.  I didn\'t see the point of doing Extended generation on an entire galaxy,
figuring that you\'d only want to do it on those systems you were interested in.

Concerning the database thing: not a complete solution, but how about, for
every system you have 3 files:
  name.sector (mainworld generated sector info)
  name.xboats (xboats routes in sector name)
  name.extend (additional info on world I\'m interested in)

the last would have lines with *Subsector name-of-subsector, after which
information on worlds in that subsector would be listed. Each world would
be introduced by a delimiter of *World name & UWP of world followed by whatever
info you decided to place there.  That info could be a small paragraph or the
extended generation info, or a page of info, or some encounter tables, and a
couple of pages of info, whatever.  This makes it a text database and thus
portable, requiring only a search function to find the world you want. If there
wasn\'t anymore information known about the world except that found in the
sector list the world would not have to be listed. What do you think?

My, you have been busy.  I appreciate all the work you went to to adjust
my programs for MT.  I think I\'ll hack them into my coding style and
re-release them.  I\'ll keep the old ones around for those people
uninterested in MT.

I like the idea of having three files for the sector, and I think your
approach might just work: one file for UWP\'s, one file for routes, and
one file for extension information.

One thing we want to be careful to avoid is duplicating information.  We
should try to work out a single "Key" data item.  For the systems, for
example, we have the hex id.  So now I come to this idea:

        Name.sector     Sector name, Subsector names, and all system UWP\'s
        Name.routes     Xboat, trade, and other routes
        Name.extend     Textual extra information on Sector, Subsectors, and
                        systems.

The Name.sector file is organized as follows:

        #Sector: Spinward Marches
        #Subsector_A: Chronor
        Zeycude         0101 C330698-9 A Na Ni Po De    613Zh M9 V
        Reno            0102...
        Errere          0103...
        Cantrel         0104...
        Gyomar          0108...
        ...
        #Subsector_B: Jewell
        #Subsector_C: Regina
        ...
        #Subsector_P: Trin\'s Veil
        ...

The "#" lines are comments, unless everything up to the first leading
whitespace matches a "magic pattern", like "#Sector:" or
"#Subsector_B:".

The Name.routes file is organized as follows:

        #Route: Xboat
        # Zhodani Xboat Routes
        0103 0304 0303
        0412 0614 0712 0610 0608 0307 0304 0705 0904 1103 1402
        # Darrian Confederation Xboat Routes
        0421 0223 0325 0426 0527 0727
        0325 0624 0724
        ...
        #Route: Megacorporation
        # Oberlindes Lines (Starts at Regina)
        1910 1912 1815 ...
        ...
        #Route: Free Trader Routes
        # Tureded and vicinity
        2414 2514

Here the magic pattern is "#Route:".

Note that rather than having pairs of connected systems, we have a "run"
of connected systems, which avoids a lot of repetition when there is no
branching.  There is nothing to stop you from listing everything as
pairs, though, and this is probably what automatic software generation
will do.

The Name.extend file would be something like this:

        #Sector
        The Spinward Marches...
        ...
        #Subsector_A
        The Chronor Subsector is the home of the Zhodani, who...
        ...
        #System_0101
        The Zeycude system is organized as follows...
        ...
        and here are some world maps...
        ...

If there is browsing software, it will use the magic code fields to
correlate data with the Name.sector file and the name.route file.

Well, what do you think? Shall we call a committee with the rest of the
list? I like your ideas.

We also need to talk about clever programs which operate on the data.
I can think of lots of programs to emit postscript:

        sector2ps - Sector map of systems, ala the Spinward Marches map
        routes2ps - Sector map transparency overlay for each kind of trade route
        extend2ps - Program to format extended information pages

You\'d use the above to create pages for a 3-ring binder, for example.

Browsing programs (ascii output):

        showsub - show a subsector map
        showsys - show UWP of system and expansion data
        showsysroutes - show map of vicinity around a system with routes

As well as programs which do generation:

        gensec - generates sectors
        namesec - replaces "Unnamed" on everything with random names
        expandsys - generates expanded data for a system, adds into name.expand
        genroutes - generate automatic routes
        annosys, annosub, annosec - add anotation text to the .expand file

Maybe one big master program that gives you different windows onto the
data, allows selections and operations via a graphics interface on a Mac
or Sun.

So, would you like me to send system.c back to you?

Subject: Re: Gensec and Mapsub
From: Fred Schiff

I like your ideas completely.  Which are actually my ideas, except I
communicated telepathically to you to write them out so nice. (Ah elegeance,
elegance, again a big :-;)

I suppose it is about time to take them to committee. I leave in your capable
hands both editing my C hacks and forming something to say to the list.

A few points first: (but you were expecting that)

You gave the UWP in the same format as GDW does, with alignment immediately
after the three data numbers and stars after. I guess this is ok, even if
I don\'t care for it, as it is necessary to be compatible with what has gone
before, besides which I can always filter the damm things out on my browsing
programs. Of course, gensec must now generate the stars in a system.

Xboat routes: How do you indicate that a route goes off the area of the map?

Putting keys into the files makes things a little more difficult; gensec
now has to check if the file already exists and go in & read it in before
placing info for a subsector. Of course there are other ways to arrange
things, but it all gets a little more messy for these programs; they can
no longer just filter a file but do some processing on it. (poorly stated
and not too important, but I think you get the idea)

Free form data base: a general rule is that you shouldn\'t make things with
fixed fields.  This is important since, for example, the trade codes will
probably be kind of long; besides the trade codes there are about a dozen
odd things that can be put in there. So do we but delimeters into the
mainworld info or do we write things in such a way that they are parsed
correctly? (This depends on a certain extend as to how long the trade
field is.)

Agreement on non-redundancy of info in separate files.

Will extended system information require a special data format the way
basic generation does?

?World maps? in the extended file? Ah, one of your dreams...but how?

Have you seen Traveller\'s Digest?  They print subsector maps that are also
a good format for output.

The routine \'upstr\' is missing from mapsub and bzero is declared twice in
gensec. (My compiler didn\'t have it--stupid PC software.)

I don\'t need the file system.c.  I printed out the whole thing before
breaking it into little pieces, and I don\'t like their code anyway.

Oh, well, credit deserves to go where credit is due; I just took your
ideas and re-explained them in a way I could understand and grok.
They\'re still 95% your ideas.  By adding my own I intend to reduce that
percentage :-).

Since you already hinted at the idea, I suppose I shall follow up.  BUT
if I could, I\'d like to get you to drive the discussion.  Seems I get a
lot of mail already :-).  If you can\'t, for some reason, I suppose the
discussion will continue, albeit at a slower pace.  I good place to start
would be to digest the messages we\'ve already started with.

BTW, I took your latest version of gensec and mapsub and hacked on them
a little.  I think they\'re ready to distribute.  I just wanted to get
your agreement that your additions count as a "derivative work", and
that they are still subject to my copyright.  As a result I added back
in all the copyright information.  Before I redistributed them, I wanted
to make sure this settles well with you.  Your contributions to the
program are duly cited in the source comments.

I\'m also going to maintain both versions; the new ones are fully
compatible with MT, and mostly compatible with old Traveller, so both
should remain available.

I just got it from the interim version of gensec.  I have no qualms of
starting a new (saner) format.  I have no reason why I would insist
having stars listed in the UWP, aside from compatibility (which I feel
is sometimes a good thing).

> Xboat routes: How do you indicate that a route goes off the area of the map?

I haven\'t thought it through yet.  Maybe a code of "OFF" is close
enough.  I suppose one could indicate which hex in an adjoining sector
is the corresponding one; that could work correctly, given that jumps
are always 4 pc or less.

The keys allow us to simply cross-reference the data with a program.
The keys we are using are:

        Sector name (all related files begin with the sector name)
        Subsector letter (A..P, used in the .sector and .expand)
        World hexid (0101..3240, used in .sector, .expand, and .routes)

I\'m trying to keep real, useful, and complete information in each file.
Thus, everything necessary for basic generation is in .sector, including
all standard sector mapping info.  All route information is additional
information, and resides in .routes.  Similarly, textual discussion,
expansion data, and whatnot are listed in .expand.

My understanding is that the .expand contains textual information that
is basically commentary; it isn\'t used by any program, it is just
displayed as needed.

Maybe we should have .expand for expansion data, and .text for textual
data.  Hmmm... why not .map for map data, too.  Keep all this modular,
and indexed by system hexid.  Then approriate output filters need only
look at files they are interested in.

        .sector - UWP\'s, sector, subsector, and system names
        .routes - trade, xboat, other routes
        .expand - expanded system data for systems
        .text - commentary on sector, subsector, systems, worlds
        .map - world map information for individual worlds

We\'ll need a program to generate .sector, then from .sector generate
.routes, .expand, .maps seperately.  And a program to add/edit text
commentary.  And a master menu program? This could get really big.  Now
what format to generate/store the data in? Should be field-independant,
I suppose.  Maybe something like termcap? Yech! Gotta get something better.

Ah, yes.  Maybe we should have a passwd-style database, with the fields
seperated by a field seperator (in unix passwd file, ":").  I personally
hate having to line everything up on the columns, I just did it to be
compatible with Challenge #25.

> Agreement on non-redundancy of info in separate files.

I see then that we do agree.

> Will extended system information require a special data format the way
> basic generation does?

I didn\'t think so, I just considered it "extra color" to throw in to the
.expand or .text file.

> ?World maps? in the extended file? Ah, one of your dreams...but how?

I envision having a program that, given a UWP, generates terrain,
weather, ocean currents (or glacier flow :-), demographics maps, etc.  I
should probably look at Grand Survey/Grand Census before I embark on
this.  It would be nice to know what a world looks like.  Long ago I
generated a quarter-subsector\'s worth of systems with a home-brew system
similar to Book 6 (which wasn\'t out yet).  I had detailed maps of all
the important worlds, moons, etc.  I was really proud of it.  For me,
maps really add to the experience.

No.  I\'d like to.  I better visit the Military Corner (local gaming
store) this weekend.  Looks like I\'ll have to shell out bucks for
Challenge, Traveller\'s Digest, and Grand Survey/Census, eventually.
Yuck, credit cards are nearing critical mass, almost ready to
gravitationally collapse and begin fusion...

Yeah, I added one in of my own, and made bzero conditionally compile, too.

Fine. Send out the program with appropriate copywrite notices.

I have no problem with coordinating discussion, except that I am
graduating in May so we\'ll have to work fast. Plus I really don\'t
know how to handle such a task. Youv\'e done it before obviously, so
how about some advice?

I do not live in the UK. I\'m attending school at the State University
of New York at Binghamton. I got rid of my .sig by accident a few weeks
ago and didn\'t get around to putting another one in. UK indeed!!

You may want to wait on Grand Census/Grand Survey. The Digest people are
coming out with a new combined edition called, I think Grand Design, or
some such, in May or June.

I\'ve determined that stars should not be in basic generation; there not really
necessary, you only need to know the tech level and gas giant prescence if
you only want the mainworld. I think GDW put them in because they had the
information, (which strikes me as unfair since the list didn\'t have the names
of the systems).

I do not have a copy of our messages on this computer. I sent them to another
computer, so in order to send them somewhere I would have to download them &
then upload them. I\'m not a very organized person. Sloppy Oscar is me.

If the database uses a separate program for output formatting, it is perfectly
ok for the database to have :: separators between fields.  It makes a bit more
sense also since the first round at the output programs may be awk programs.
(If we find someone proficient in it)  Someplace I have a reference to an
article in Software about an awk database: it built a directory and a bunch
of commands for your database in such a way that you used the names of the
fields in your commands, and the commands translated them to the appropriate
#. And no I can\'t find it since its at home (home, home--Binghamton is similar
to Purgatory) under a foot and a half of accumulated computer papers and
photo copies.  The program allowed database function to filter into each other
(we can\'t with ours--we\'ve got comments imbedded) but required a special
command to actually change the database.

If we have a separate file (.text) for commentary, then wouldn\'t the .expand
file have a passwd type format as well. Unsure of this. Hmmmm...maybe it just
makes it easier with a .text and .expand file.

Do you have animal encounter table software? Or character generation software?
I got 1 (one) (single) response. Fella said, "If you find any of these coult
I have some too?"

I\'m unsure of the output format for expanded system generation. The St program
(which I never compiled) is missing some things, is somewhat unclear, and the
Ref\'s manual rules are a little unclear about some stuff. ie. if I get a
captured planet with a deviation of 0 what does that mean?, since type O & B
and size Ia & Ib stars are not generated, should star generation be part of
gensec (man with editor can change course of turtle island, eh kee-mo-sabi?),
how exactly do I determine where mainworld goes - there are available orbits
and the planet can go around the far companion.

Ugh. Its big really big. And you thought a walk down to the drugstore was a
long haul, but let me tell you....Ok I live in New York, where do you live?

Hello Robert! Boy, you\'ve been busy.  So has another listee, Fred Schiff

him on this message to keep him up-to-date, and I\'m keeping all this
discussion online so that when the (new) topic coordinator can start, I
can forward it to him.

However, Fred\'s format and coding style is much more similar to the
original gensec program.  He and I have discussed a general dislike we
have for a couple parts of the MT Spinward Marches Sector Listing
format, and have been discussing how best to store sector data at
several levels of detail (UWP data, textual annotation, expanded system
generation, trade routes, etc).

I understand, I never wrote that code to be really, really portable.

Stylistically, Fred and I have settled on a format as follows:

Note that for brevity, the Star Types/Sizes are not included.  They aren\'t
functionally useful in any that Fred or I can determine.

Hmmm... it would also run on a Sun 386i, like we have here, if it\'s
UNIX-compatible.  The Sun does VGA and CGA.  But I don\'t know that Suns
have Pascal support; I don\'t think ours do.

As for GDW getting upset, I wouldn\'t pretend to know.  I suggest you
write them a long letter or figure out how to call them.  It\'s really
important to let them know what you\'re doing, especially if you\'re going
to sell the software for profit.  I suspect that GDW would get fairly
upset about the Spinward Marches data itself.  Pick up a copy of
Challenge magazine and browse through the MegaTraveller publishing data
to find contacts within GDW.

There is already a volunteer for a topic coordinator for the Star
Systems discussion, whom I haven\'t gotten back to yet.  I think that
more discussion, idea brandishing, etc. would be very valuable on this
topic, and I\'d like you to lobby for what you think might work best.
The more ideas we get for data representation and
generation/display/maintenance implementations, the better off the final
products will be.

Will do.  You should\'ve gotten a message I\'m sending to another fellow who

It\'s probably a good time to try to come up with something universal.

Not in the UK? Oops! I thought the name sounded UK-ish.  I live in Portland,

I just heard this weekend that Grand Survey/Census are out-of-print, and that
a MegaTravellerized version was in the works.  Wonder when we\'ll see
anything.

I agree with you about the non-necessity of stars in the basic generation.

Deviation of 0?  I either reroll or count the captured panet as a moon (or if
too large, as the planet, and make the original planet a moon).
I think star generation belongs in a seperate, expanded system generator.  I
agree that the Ia, Ib, O & B should not be machine generated -- it should only
be assigned by the Ref.  Mainworld is either the planet with the highest pop,
or if it\'s premade it is placed in the innermost habitable orbit.  If there\'s
lotsa gas giants, it becomes a moon of the GG in the habitable orbit.
Probably those are my rules.

Gotta run, get some work done.

Ahhh, and after all that hard work... :-(  (Just Kidding)
I would like to see the star data there as I, for one, use it.  I use it to
determine the orbits of the worlds etc.  Eventhough, Dinomn (or Dinome) can not
exist by the rules.  I am sorry, you just can\'t have a type 6 atmosphere when
you are in orbit one around an M6 Dwarf, even though the rules say you can, it
is just too darned cold (Something like 79 degrees Kelvin), Yes Virginia,
Oxygen does freeze.  But, if you are going to do any amount of intra-system
travelling, the Star info is the beginning.

I personally would like to see it taken even farther, but it becomes a data
nightmare to manage.  For simplicity sake, we need to keep what ever format
ASCII and under 80 characters and one line per system, but I would like to code
in some orbital information as well.  (My I ask alot).

I would like to see a column somewhere where I can put my * so that I know to
look for a file with that hex id for a filename.  It is a very simple way of
maintaining library information on a given world.  The new format is quite
accpetiable.  (Now I just have to convert my MARCHES.DAT file to the new format
:-(  I guess I will write a program to do it... :-) )

From: vu0141@bingvaxu.cc.binghamton.edu (Fred Schiff)
Subject: Summary of ideas for Database approach to star/system etc gen.

All these ideas are Fred Schiff\'s with some help from James Perkins.
The following is a summary of ideas we hashed together in some discussions
about computer generation and storage/reclamation of star system information
in the MegaTraveler universe.


Basic idea:

  ability to create and output (in serveral ways) any multiple
  layers of detail inherent in the MT system (galaxy/quadrant/sector/
  subsector/system/star/orbit/planet-belt/moon/planet-map/
  region-map/local-map) in a portable form on a computer.


Points:

You should be able to comment any sort of object (Sector, Subsector,
System, Star, Planet, Moon, Etc.)

All these things should be optional, in fact I think you should be able
to fill stuff out from the top down.  Oh, you want to look at THIS
subsector? Quick... generate all the systems in it, stow it away.  And
you want to look at THIS system\'s extended generation stuff? Quick,
generate the expanded system data, stow it away.  Oh, a world map, QUICK,
generate a world map at the grainy level.  This region?  Quick, generate a
regional map... etc.

Free form data base: a general rule is that you shouldn\'t make things with
fixed fields.  This is important since, for example, the trade codes will
probably be kind of long; besides the trade codes there are about a dozen
odd things that can be put in there.

One thing we want to be careful to avoid is duplicating information.
Each separate item should have its own "Key" data item. For example,
we have the hex id for systems.

We should have a passwd-style database, with the fields seperated by a field
seperator (in unix passwd file, ":").  Its stupid to have to line
everything up on the columns.

Like this:


    Name.{filetype}
        .sector - UWP\'s, sector, subsector, and system names
        .routes - trade, xboat, other routes
        .expand - expanded system data for systems
        .text - commentary on sector, subsector, systems, worlds
        .map - world map information for individual worlds
        .key - (optional) explanation & code for each new base code,
               classification data and alegiance code used in .sector file;
               used to make explanation key box in outputs

The Name.sector file is organized as follows:

        #Sector: Spinward Marches
        #Subsector_A: Chronor
        Zeycude         0101 C330698-9 A Na Ni Po De    613Zh M9 V
        Reno            0102...
        Errere          0103...
        Cantrel         0104...
        Gyomar          0108...
        ...
        #Subsector_B: Jewell
        #Subsector_C: Regina
        ...
        #Subsector_P: Trin\'s Veil
        ...

Note: lines are not shown with \':\' field separators for clarity.

I originally thought that star generation should not be part of basic
system (ie. mainworld) generation, since that info is not really needed
at that point, but have since changed my mind.  The stars should be
place in the .sector file but do not need to be output along with the
rest of the mainworld data.  Generating the stars at the mainworld
creation time allows you to place Ia, Ib and O stars and other such
objects which must be placed explicitly by the Ref.

The "#" lines are comments, unless everything up to the first leading
whitespace matches a "magic pattern", like "#Sector:" or
"#Subsector_B:".

The Name.routes file is organized as follows:

        #Route: Xboat
        # Zhodani Xboat Routes
        0103 0304 0303
        0412 0614 0712 0610 0608 0307 0304 0705 0904 1103 1402
        # Darrian Confederation Xboat Routes
        0421 0223 0325 0426 0527 0727
        0325 0624 0724
        ...
        #Route: Megacorporation
        # Oberlindes Lines (Starts at Regina)
        1910 1912 1815 ...
        ...
        #Route: Free Trader Routes
        # Tureded and vicinity
        2414 2514

Here the magic pattern is "#Route:".

Note that rather than having pairs of connected systems, we have a "run"
of connected systems, which avoids a lot of repetition when there is no
branching.  There is nothing to stop you from listing everything as
pairs, though, and this is probably what automatic software generation
will do.

The Name.text file would be something like this:

        #Sector
        The Spinward Marches...
        ...
        #Subsector_A
        The Chronor Subsector is the home of the Zhodani, who...
        ...
        #System_0101
        The Zeycude system is organized as follows...
        ...
        and here are some world maps...
        ...

If there is browsing software, it will use the magic code fields to
correlate data with the Name.sector file and the name.route file.

This:
        Zeycude         0101 C330698-9 A Na Ni Po De    613Zh M9 V
is only one possible output format (Spinward Marches list type)
I prefer Traveler\'s Digest form:
        Zeycude         0101 C330698-9 A Na Ni Po De    613 Zh
with travel zone at end, no stars listed and allegiance separated
from data values by a blank.

We also need to talk about clever programs which operate on the data.
I can think of lots of programs to emit postscript:

        sector2ps - Sector map of systems, ala the Spinward Marches map
        sub2ps    - SubSector map of systems, ala Digest Group map
        routes2ps - Sector map transparency overlay for each kind of trade route
        extend2ps - Program to format extended information pages

You\'d use the above to create pages for a 3-ring binder, for example.

Browsing programs (ascii output):

        showsub - show a subsector map
        showsys - show UWP of system and expansion data
        showsysroutes - show map of vicinity around a system with routes

As well as programs which do generation:

        gensec - generates sectors
        namesec - replaces "Unnamed" on everything with random names
        expandsys - generates expanded data for a system, adds into name.expand
        genroutes - generate automatic routes
        annosys, annosub, annosec - add anotation text to the .text file

And of course we need some sort of menu program to tie everything together.
Maybe one big master program that gives you different windows onto the
data, allows selections and operations via a graphics interface on a Mac
or Sun.  Preferably something simple to begin with of course.

Its needed to keep real, useful, and complete information in each file.
Thus, everything necessary for basic generation is in .sector, including
all standard sector mapping info.  All route information is additional
information, and resides in .routes.  Similarly, textual discussion,
and whatnot are listed in .text and expansion data, in .expand.

Greetings,

	While driving to work this morning, I happened to be thinking
about the technical explanations for how jump drives work.  A
question came to mind:

	If you had a space station of some kind sitting out in flat
space that had a big fusion generator of the kind that powers jump
drives, could you hook it up to the crystals in a starship that was in
orbit with the station and charge the crystals without having to burn
any fuel in the starship itself.  Then, when the crystals are charged,
the ship could move itself out a little from the station (into
effectively flat space) and jump on the power stored in the crystals.
This way the ship would not need jump fuel or a "jump drive" (fusion
plant).  The only problem I can see with this is if the ship is
required to burn the fuel during the entire jump to maintain the
field.  But then why do you need the crystals at all?  Also, how do
drop tanks work in that case?  (My understanding of drop tanks says
that the fuel in them is burned and the tanks are dropped prior to
jump, so you do not have to "jump" the mass of the tanks and fuel.)

	Has anyone else had this idea?

Which brings back my earlier question. How many hull hits can the ship sustain
before it is unable to jump? Under High Guard, the only ways to prevent the
other ship from jumping are to disable something critical (drives, bridge,
computer) or to drain its fuel. Using this "net" system, even a few surface
hits would prevent a breakoff by jumping.

>>Ah yes. These fellows also think gauss guns are silent.
>
>Actually, wouldn\'t they be about as silent as a pistol with a silencer?

As I said, if the projectile is subsonic. Silencers are designed to reduce the
velocity of the bullet to subsonic for just this reason. But a 9mm slug is a
lot heavier than a 4mm needle. And even then, the silenced gun has a very low
penetration, much less than that of a gauss pistol. In Striker, a 9mm pistol
(unsilenced) has penetration 2. A gauss pistol has penetration 4.

>The Starship book doesn\'t mention anything about Black Globes or
>alternative charging methods in the Jump Drive chapter.

My quote was from GDW\'s Book 5, High Guard, and is therefore official rules.
Of course, the rules may have changed a bit. As you\'ve probably noticed, I\'m
still using good ol\' Traveller (with add-ons like Striker).

>Talking about extra capacitors, anyone ever design a ship which has
>piles of extra capacitors? I designed some ships which would burn the
>reserve capacitor energy to feed infrequently-used things like weaponry
>and active defenses.

When designing warships, I almost always allow sufficient power to let the ship
use its full agility and still use all weapons and screens. Anything else is
very dangerous if the other ship fires a spinal mount meson gun or particle
accelerator at you. I don\'t include extra capacitors, as the amount needed to
make a significant addition uses a lot of space which is badly needed for other
things. But the ship does often use energy from the capacitors instead of the
power plant - in fact, it has to, to avoid overload! My black-globed ships also
have another device, which may violate the spirit of the rules but should be
possible; a globe interrupter. This briefly turns off the globe to allow
out-going fire to pass unhindered. The ship\'s computer synchronises all fire
to cross the globe boundary simultaneously (fire missiles, then particle beams,
then lasers). Result; my globe does not protect the enemy. There is a slight
chance that enemy fire will hit my ship at the same time, but the computer
tries to make intervals between salvoes as unpredictable as possible.

Question 1: What happens to a missile which hits a black globe?
Question 2: Does a black globe absorb gravity? If so, I\'ve invented a perpetual
motion machine and free power source. Just have a black globe generator linked
to a laser and timer. Turn on the globe; it absorbs gravity, and
slowly gains height. After a preset time, the globe is turned off by the timer
and some associated circuitry. It fires its laser at a receiver, getting rid
of the energy it picked up by absorbing gravity. It also falls. After another
preset time, the globe goes back on again, restarting the cycle.
	If a black globe doesn\'t absorb gravity, then repulsors and tractors
can be fired through one, which gives a ship with its globe fully on a way of
discharging its capacitors.

	Samantha goes off to her stateroom and returns with some data chips.  
She places them on the tray next to the CRT and begins a search on the word 
`Binary\'.  Steve went to his room and got some paper and a pen. He begins to jot
down some notes, hoping to break the `code\' he believes the book is written in.

	About 5 minutes later Erekosse comes upstairs and says, "The captain 
said I should wait up here with you guys and just watch for anything.  What are
you doing?"
	"Well I was looking through the hand computer\'s files," begins Samantha,
"and I found this out."  She shows Erekosse the data displayed, relating to the
Binary and the bank transaction.
	"What\'s he doing?"
	"Me," says Steve.  "I think that this book is written in some sort of 
code, and since I did have a crash course in the Marines, I thought I\'d give it
a try."
	"Code huh, I\'ll look at it later, this bank transaction looks familiar
for some reason, I seem to know ... damn, I can\'t think now.  Tell me if you 
guys figure anything out.  I\'m gonna stare at this for a while.  Remember, we\'re
also supposed to be watching out for whatever might occur."
	"Okay," they both reply.

	"Well what do you think," says Erc.
	"Damn if I know.  This is really strange.  I think I want to go talk
with Hubert and settle this once and for all, I\'m getting fed up with this."
	"Yeah, but should we open it?"
	"I think it might be safer if we leave it alone, as this readout says, 
everything is fine, I think it\'s best to keep it that way."
	"Okay, I\'ll clean up, sort of, and meet you upstairs?"
	"Right, see you there," says the captain as he lowers to the floor.  He
gets off the floater and straightens himself out and walks towards the stairs up
to the common room.
	Erc begins cleaning up the tools and the equipment after he sets down
on the floor too.

	The the captain come into the common room to and sees Erekosse sitting 
at a chair looking at a hand computer.  Samantha looks frustrated, and Steve 
looks like he\'s got something.
	"What is it Steve?" says the captain.
	"Well according to my calculations the code in this book says something
like this:  YUARLK EDUGHY IKLUTEF PIUOLL QAZEUT HVERTUI."  He\'s nodding his head
in a triumphant manner, "thats what it means."
	"Do you understand it?"
	"Well uh ... ummm ... not really, but maybe the computer will if we put
it through the language translator."
	"Yeah, okay, whatever you say," mutters the captain.
	"What\'s wrong Samantha?"
	She explains what she found in the hand computer and says she has 
searched through all her records about animals and plants everywhere, thinking 
that that is what the code was for.  She found zilch, nil, nothing, zero about
didly squat.
	The captain tells you all what he and Erc found out downstairs in the 
crate, and as he is done, Erc comes upstairs.  "Now what I want to do is talk to
Hubert, interrogate him, sorta speak.  Steve I want you with me.  Erc I\'d like
you to look at those plans that Charlie printed out, see if we can somehow 
get a look inside, without opening, or see if that panel might `know\' what its 
contents are.  Erekosse, I\'d like you to talk to Dan and Charlie about you
know what, and convince them that everything is under control, and if they have
any info that can helps us it will be most helpful.  Samantha I want you just
to keep you eyes open, real wide."
	
	The captain and Steve walk to Huberts\' stateroom door, the captain
unlocks it and enters, with Steve in tow.  Hubert was resting on the bed, 
staring at the cieling.  He sits up when the captain and Steve enter, he says,
"Well what do you want now?"
	"Answers," replys the captain as he takes a seat across from Hubert,
Steve situates himself at the door, his gun in easy reach, and he makes sure 
that Hubert sees it.
	"To what questions, if I may ask."
	"THE question is simple, what\'s in the crate?"
	"What crate?"
	"The crate in my cargo hold, that is from the Arter Apparel Corp.  I was
just down there checking it out, and it seems to me that you\'re lying about its
contents.  Now you tell me what\'s in there, or so help me I\'ll find out myself
and flush you into jumpspace."
	Hubert seemed to flinch when the captain mentioned about checking out 
the crate, but other than that his reactions are calm.  "Well first let me say
that before I go telling you anything, I want your help and before you go off
and tell me to fuck myself, I\'ll say this, those guys aren\'t IBI agents."
	"Go on."
	"NO, first you say that there will be no grievences against me, and I
can take my cargo and go after we get to Aramanx.  Then I\'ll talk, but not 
before."
	"Listen to me and read my lips, you tried to hijack my ship.  So who the
hell do you think you are in asking me for anything, you ...."
	"I wasn\'t trying to hijack your ship, honest.  I ...."
	"Then why the gun," Steve says.
	"For my own protection."
	"From who," says the captain.
	"From Moe and Curly."
	"Because you\'re a hijacker and you were ...," starts the captain.
	"I\'m no hijacker," pleads Hubert.  "You\'ve got to believe me, yeah I\'ve 
might of had ideas in my childhood of being a pirate, but I never, I swear never
got involved.  The gun was for my own safety, in my line of work ...."
	"What line of work is that?" questions the captain.
	"No, no way, not until you say that you\'ll help me.  You\'ve got to, I\'ll
pay you for your trouble."
	"How much?"
	"Well I think that he," motioning to Steve, "shouldn\'t hear this."
	"Sorry, he stays.  Again, how much?"
	"Two," replies Hubert.
	"Two thousand, are you joking," laughs the captain, "I could ...."
	"Not thousand, I\'m talking a little higher, in the range of six figures
and they are all zeros," says Hubert coldly.
	"Two million, um ...."
	Steve whistles softly in the background.

	
	Erekosse walks up to Dan and Charlie\'s room, knocks, and when he hears
one of then say, "Come in."  He enters.  The room is quite messy, the personal
computer is on the desk, and Charlie is at it, working.  Dan is one of the beds
reading some papers.  There are papers on the floor, and on the other bed.  
	Dan sits up and says, "What can we do for you sir?"
	"Well to start off, I must say thanks for the warning.  I read your note
Charile."
	"Oh, you did," he says as he turns to face Erekosse.  "That\'s good, so
then you know about the `door\'?"
	"Yes, I found it and took it out, it wasn\'t hard to do."
	"I know, I made it so you could.  If I really wanted to you could still
be trying right now ...."
	"Don\'t brag Charlie.  So you understand the predictament we are in?"
	"Not anymore, believe me, we have everything under control right now and
there is nothing to worry about.  Why the door anyway?"
	"Who knows, they told us to do it."
	"Who did?"
	"You didn\'t read the note then?" inquires Dan.
	"I did."
	"You didn\'t put that in the note," Dan says to Charlie.  "I thought I 
told you to put it in the note."
	"I forgot to, I mean let\'s be real here, I was pressed for time and 
space, and ...," says Charlie.
	"Well what was I supposed to read."
	"Huh, oh just that it was Moe and Curly who threatened us to do it."
	"Moe and Curly?"
	"Yeah, they said make sure that there is info on the IBI in the computer
and that these numbers, that they gave us came out okay.  They said we wouldn\'t
be hurt, and stuff like that."
	"But why," asks Erekosse.
	"Why?  Are you acting stupid on purpose or something," says Dan.  "There
are no records available to the public on the workings of the IBI.  I myself 
know only because of the top-secret work I\'ve done for the Imperium on ... well
I can\'t go into it.  But really, the IBI is like the secret police in the early
Terra years, you know, the Gestapo, CIA, KGB, and all those agencies.  They
so `unknown\' that you can never be sure if the person is real or not.  Only 
recently has some data come out on the workings of the IBI, and your system 
hasn\'t had a recent update ...."
	"How did you know that?"
	"Well I um ...."
	"They told us," says Charlie.
	"Moe and Curly?" asks Erekosse.
	"Yes, they told us to do it, since the computer was older and there 
would be no records, to do it.  To make things go more smoothly.  That\'s what
they said, or something to the likeness of it."
	"When did you guys talk to them?"
	"Before we got onboard, after we purchased the tickets, they came up 
to us in the waiting lounge at the Starport ...."
	"The Starport," shouts Erekosse, startling both Dan and Charlie, "that\'s
it."  He opens the door and runs and grabs the hand computer.
	
	"What\'s up," says Samantha.
	"I figured out this bank statement," says Erekosse.  "You see I was
sure I recognized the transfer ID:  PTP-SA-62.  But I couldn\'t remember what it
was till now."
	"Well tell us," says Erc.
	"Well it\'s simple, the PTP stands for Pysadi Ticket Purchasing, and the
SA is Starport Alpha, and 62 is the dock number."
	"62, hey, that\'s where the Ulysses was docked," says Erc.
	"Exactly," says Erekosse.

	"Well if you think that\'s good, wait till you get this," says Samantha.
"Remember that number:  Binary -- 8AC23D.  Well I was just fooling with it
in my head, and something made some weird sense, maybe it\'s too much caffine or
something but if you convert all the numbers, which are represented in hexidec-
imal code, into BINARY, it becomes:  1000 1010 1100 0010 0011 1101."
	"So, what all you have now is a bunch of numbers in binary representat-
ion.  What good is that?" says Erekosse.
	"Well I said, look at the first number, it\'s 8 right, well what if
you take the binary and represent it in octal, you\'d get something like this:
4 2 5 4 1 0 7 5.  Means nothing huh, but it\'s the exact numbers necessary for
a world UPP, and the 4 could mean the 4th letter in starport/spaceport codes,
meaning the UPP would be D254107-5.  But it\'s just a guess."
	"Hell of a guess," comments Erc.  "But wait, if I remember my basic
computer class, that binary number is actually negative, and if you take this
something complement, or something like that, you would get a positive, right?"
	"Yeah you would," says Erekosse.  He grabs a piece of paper and jots
down the binary numbers and with a little computation says, "Well if you do it
taking it negative, and making it positive, then we get:  3 5 2 3 2 7 0 2.  I
think that means the UPP would be C523270-2."
	"This is really reaching don\'t you guys think," says Erc.
	"Pretty thin," says Samantha.
	"Hell," says Erekosse, "thin is my middle name."
	"With your cooking I\'m not surprised," mumbles Erc.
	"Let\'s tell the captain," says Samantha.

Whatever your feelings about the Digest Group people, you might want
to learn to live with it - their stuff might as well be stamped
"Official Material".  Marc Miller seems to think the world of them;
they really wrote MegaTraveller, and he (Miller) co-authors the Q&A
column in _Traveller\'s Digest_.  In one of those columns, he clarifies
(read: contradicts) that passage in High Guard, saying that the clause
about energy in the capacitors is unnecessary, and that the fuel
requirements are still there.

With respect to gauss guns, for a long time, I\'ve allowed them to have
a switch that lets them fire subsonic.  It cuts their penetration in
half and shortens their range, but it\'s sometimes worth it.  Even when
fired normally, it is easy to tell someone\'s shooting at you, but
rather more difficult to tell where they are.

Unless i\'m mistaken, the bit about the jump grid originally came from
an article in the Journal on jump space (by Marc Miller?), not the DG
folks.  As far as I know, no one has addressed what happens when its
damaged.  I still haven\'t seen the Starship Operator\'s Guide, but it
does sound, ummm, interesting.  Anybody care to review it?

Hello all...

Bundled in with the MegaTraveller boxed set is a sector map of the Spinward
Marches.  Throughout the documentation there are references, by sector and hex,
of various systems, such as Antiquity and Capitol.  My question is, are all the
sectors shown in the "whole Imperium" maps available through GDW (or anyone?)

For instance, is there an "official" Corridor sector map available?  If not,
are all the pre-defined "official"  systems, like Depot/Corridor compiled
someplace?

The upshoot of this is whether I should invest the time working up a Corridor
sector, or if I can just buy one somewhere.

There is a publication from GDW, called "Atlas of the Imperium". It contains
maps of all sectors in the Imperium, and one or two not in the Imperium
(especially since some have seceded during the Rebellion). Unfortunately,
that\'s all it contains. High population worlds are named, but no others are.
No UPP data is given, except starport class, presence of gas giants, and
presence of naval and scout bases. Still, it gives you something to start from.

I believe there was a book put out by GDW about a year or two back, called
the Atlas of the Imperium. It had maps of all the sectors of the Imperium.
May be someone else knows more about it.

Subjects in today\'s digest:
	Welcome, and a call for input
	Ideas for Speculative Trade

- ----

From: James T. Perkins <jamesp@dadla.la.tek.com>
Subject: Welcome, and a call for input

Now we have a second digest -- the Trade & Commerce Digest.  This also
grew out of the call for volunteers that I sent out a few weeks ago.
The topic coordinator for this discussion is GREG GIVLER, who has
graciously offered to to coordinate Starship Cargo, Freight, and
Passenger issues.  Let\'s hear it for Greg!

The Trade and Commerce Digest will start by discussing a replacement for
the MegaTraveller/Merchant Prince system for generating and pricing
random cargo for Starship Trade.  Greg will collect your contributions
on this topic (assuming you\'re one of the listees who\'s interested
enough in the topic to participate), edit them for clarity, and send
them out to the entire Traveller Mailing List in the Digest.  He\'ll
attempt to lead the discussion and try to organize all the input into a
more cohesive whole.

As with the Star System Digest, Those of you uninterested in the topic
will be able to quickly recognize and delete the digests, and your mail
traffic will not be greatly increased, due to the digesting.

There has been a lot said about the "Trade Item Generation" tables in
the various editions of Traveller.

The original, rather simplistic model contained a table of items and
prices.  Any cargo item was equally likely to occur.  The costs/prices
were modified by die modifiers listed for each item.  The profit margin
could fluctuate between 40 and 400% of the base price, depending on
player skill and luck of the die.

The Merchant Prince system, also used in MegaTraveller, contains a table
of items for each possible world trade class, so different items have
different likelihoods of appearing.  It also contains an interesting
mechanism for classifying cargos as requiring "special handling", i.e.
it is flammable, alive, or corrosive.

However, many have voiced unhappiness about both systems.  There are
those who would take this modular piece out of Traveller and replace it
with a new mechanism.  Hence this digest.  [As an aside, isn\'t it neat
how Traveller is designed very modularly in this instance?]

The following is the first digest, which I have done for Greg as an
example.  Greg will start collecting your input for digest volume 2
immediately.

As a beginning, I\'d like interested parties to LIST THE REASONS WHY YOU
LIKE AND DISLIKE THE TWO EXISTING METHODS of cargo generation, and SEND
THEM TO GREG.  That way we can start to specify the requirements for a
new system.  At the risk of jumping the gun, Mark Power has a partial
solution to the problem below.  IMHO, I think we need to take a giant
step backward before we go forward.

Thanks again, Greg, for your contribution to this discussion.

From: "MARK A. POWER" <uabmap01@asnuab.asn.net>
Subject: Ideas for Speculative Trade

PURCHASING
- - ----
1) Determine number of available cargos.  Dependent on starport and
   population?

2) Determine specific cargos.  Involves a certain amount of searching
   on the part of the players.  Referee rolls on appropriate table for
   trade class.  If multiple classes, could be 
     1) Ref\'s choice
     2) Player\'s choice
     3) Random
   Table would have base sale price for this trade class and amount
   available.  Neither 5 tons of grain nor 200 tons of lanthanum makes
   a lot of sense.  It might also be necessary to institure Tech Level
   limitations at this point.

3) Determine base asking price.  Roll on table to determine price, say
   range of 50% to 150% of base.  Add any other modifiers (TL,
   population, etc.).  This is a complexity I\'d rather avoid, but its
   probably necessary.  Note that I\'d like to make all modifiers
   percentages, not die modifiers.  A table that runs from 40% to 400%
   is a bit much, and fixed amounts are simply ridiculous.

4) Contact owner (or agent) and haggle over price.  This step could be
   a lot of fun.  If an especially choice item, you could institute a
   bidding war for it at this point.  If using MT, this is a negotiation 
   task.  If using Traveller Classic, we\'d have to come up for a rule
   for this.  Either way, the result would be a modifier in the range
   of +/-30% or so.  

5) Determine whether or not to buy.  This can be postponed until this
   point since the referee, not the players, have the table that has
   the resale values.  The players will know if they got a bargain
   based on local prices, but not on an absolute basis.

6) Determine delivery date.  Allow rush delivery at, say, 10% per day.
   At this time, determine any special handling characteristics.  I\'d
   allow them to look it up earlier, or ask during negotiations, but
   this is where they find out if they don\'t think to ask.

SALE
- - ----
1) Find a buyer.  Again, he\'s unlikely to come up and knock on the
   airlock.  How long it takes (and how many you find) is based on
   starport and population.

2) Determine base offering price.  Take base resale value from master
   table, apply appropriate modifiers from master table, roll on 
   random value table (same table as in 3 above.)

3) Select buyer and negotiate price.  See step 4 above.

4) Decide to sell or not.

5) Deliver as appropriate.  (In step 3, you agreed to deliver, and he
   just didn\'t mention he\'s in a war zone.  Or the Teamsters are on
   strike.)

(Note that I\'ve gotten no direct feedback on most of this, so it may
not be what everyone is looking for.)

Passengers & Freight:  
If someone wants to suggest something concrete, I\'d love to hear them.
There was some discussion a few weeks ago, but I didn\'t follow it
closely, nor have I put much thought into this, as what we\'ve got 
seems to get us by.

Subject: Maps

I understand that Atlas of the Imperium was not a very good product. If
you want it of course it is possible to find it *somewhere*  The information
does of course exist and is even on computer media.  There are two solutions:
petition GDW to make a real Atlas product for next year sometime, or get
the data from GDW or Digest Group, who are on the Delphi network. I do know
that they have this info on-line although I\'ve never tried to contact them
myself.

[Picked this off of rec.games.frp.  Good food for thought -- James]

I thought I would post this, both to give new DM\'s some advice (if they
want it) and to get suggestions from people.  I may have mentioned that
I run a modified Traveller world, and I replied to a suggestion that
Traveller was a "disposable" game by saying, "No, I disagree."  Both to
back up my claim, and for the reasons just mentioned above, here are
some of the things you CAN do with the Traveller world.

    1) Military mission.  This is one of the most common, so we\'ll get it
       out of the way first.  Basically, you go in, you shoot the place up,
       sometimes you rescue an important person or steal/recover important
       equipment or files.  If you want to vary this one, use different
       terrains, and give the NPC in charge of the enemy (a) different 
       equipment and defenses and (b) different weapons and troops and (c)
       different skill levels (Tactics, Leader, etc.)

    2) Trader mission.  Actually, I never run these.  But I hear they can
       be interesting.

    3) Exploration.  As I recall, there are 11,000 worlds in the Empire.
       But the Empire is at least 100 parsecs wide (which a brief bit
       of calculation informs us that there are more than 100,000 solar
       systems in that area of space--assume one solar system per 10 cubic
       parsecs and figure it out for yourself; this will vary depending
       on where you are in space obviously, but it is a workable estimate).
       So, there are all these unexplored solar systems waiting to be
       explored, with bizarre lifeforms, unfriendly settlers or enemy
       agents setting up outposts, etc.  AND every solar system has a
       cometary halo, chocked full of raw materials waiting to be charted,
       and maybe a few pirate bases, too!

    4) Espionage.  You think all wars are fought with guns?  No, no, much
       of it is what Kippling called "The Great Game."  Find enemy agents
       stealing secrets.  Steal secrets yourself.  Stop subversion. 
       Subvert the governments of enemy countries.  Assassinations, etc.
       This can be done to/for governments OR corporations (some of those
       money boys play pretty rough)

    5) Crimebusters.  You think the future has no crime?  If there is
       anything like the mafia in outer space, you have a lot of 
       adventures in store--either abetting or solving/stopping 
       (a) assassination, (b) electronic crime, (c) drug pushers,
       (d) racketeers, (e) weapons runners, (f) smugglers, (g) art
       thieves, and many more.

    6) Space military missions.  Be a privateer.  Prey on innocent
       merchants.  Get attacked by navy patrols and armed merchants.
       OR have your group hired by a local government to BE their
       navy patrol or privateers in a blockade/undeclared war against
       another planet.

    7) I love a mystery.  Have your group solve a crime that has already
       been committed, usually a murder or a theft of some valuable item.

    8) Terrorists.  (Actually, this is a variation on military and/or
       espionage and/or crimebusting, but it is different enough to
       deserve separate mention.)   Players can either stop terrorists
       (find them before they strike, etc.) or be terrorists/guerilla
       fighters in a political cause that they believe in, as opposed
       to a merc mission where they\'re simply being paid.

       These are obviously only some of the things you can do with
Traveller.  The main variations are (a) action adventures and (b) 
thinking adventures, and (c) adventures that require both.  If you 
game once a week, I think you will find that by varying adventure types
(and villains--it might help to have two or three long term bad guys 
with fairly large organizations so it takes a while to finish them off)
Traveller will keep you happy for a long, long time.

I would be happy to hear any suggestions or comments on this subject.
Thanks.

     Mark

	I often used this as a carrot...you have such and such cargo, the only
world in jump distance which you can make 500% profit is interdicted, etc. etc.

	Or BE criminals.  One of our best adventures came from a trader
mision when the PC\'s had forged papers to allow access to a semi-interdicted
world, and for various reasons stuck around long enough for the papers to go
all the way to the subsector capital and back...to be discovered as forgeries.
The PC\'s were arrested on smuggling charges (they WERE guilty) and had their
ship impounded.  An alternative to a long prison planet term was to infiltrate
a pirate oraganization...which turned out to be backed by Zhodani "advisors"

	(We may be thieves, robbers and Smugglers, but by God we\'re
	 IMPERIAL thieves robbers and smugglers!)

	Well...in my game we had (in order) Terrorists/Cultists, Bodyguard,
smuggling/military, mystery/espionage, "detective (ala bogart)" story,
smuggling, jungle exploration/hunting, anti-piracy(drafted), space-disaster,
shopping spree, mystery/starship crash, space-combat/anti-piracy/military,
jailbreak/political prisoner, politics/intrigue, mystery/politics, 
cultists/rescue...then the campaign ended :-(

	Traveller is also a "time travel" game...the cultures are at all different tech levels and have different societies.
	You can do ANYTHING...once you fix the combat system and determine
how new skills are learned :-)

Here is the list of plot ideas again, but this time I\'ve added the names of the
races which I feel most appropriate for them. After all, Imperial humans aren\'t
the only characters around!

>    1) Military mission.
Good for anyone, but especially Aslan. It\'s helpful if you have the old Book 4,
Mercenary, as this has an abstract battle system which helps if you want your
players\' action to be part of something big. On one occasion, I ran a group who
had formed a mercenary platoon, and who were one of 6 forces attacking separate
objectives. After they had completed their fight, their was a debriefing session
in which they and the leaders of the other groups compared notes. (The funny
part was, the players had earlier captured a Zhodani fighter which they tried
to use here. It flew a bit too far. One of the other leaders very proudly took
credit for shooting it down!)

>    2) Trader mission.
Imperials are good here, as so much of their territory is mapped out. Unless
you want to combine trade with...

>    3) Exploration.
The Zhodani Alien Module has an adventure in which several Imperial humans are
captured by a high Zhodani noble, who specifically needs Imperials for his
exploration mission. It also has a section on exploring unknown space. Zhodani
and Hivers have the best mentality for exploration.

>    4) Espionage.
Humans (both Imperial and Zhodani) are probably the best to use for this.

>    5) Crimebusters.
Practically anyone except Zhodani, where crime is just a mental illness.

>    6) Space military missions.  Be a privateer.  Prey on innocent
>       merchants.  Get attacked by navy patrols and armed merchants.
Vargr!

>    7) I love a mystery.
Zhodani can have great fun with their psionics, unless the mystery is to solve
a crime. What Zhodani like is exploring alien artifacts, and trying to figure
out what things they find are for. Trying to foil devious Imperial plots is
another pastime.

>    8) Terrorists.
For counter-terrorism, Imperial or Aslan. For being terrorists, Imperial or
Vargr. I once had a group of players hired by a hotel on Efate to protect it
against terrorists. The players captured one, who promptly tried to persuade
them to join his "freedom fighters". They nearly did, but they were informed
that there was no pay in it!

Subject: Review of Digest Group\'s Referee\'s Gaming Kit

OK. Its a screen!

I hate screens. I don\'t buy screens. They\'re a scheme to keep gaming companies
in the bucks. It cost $8.95 and I went and bought it. The sun was in my eyes.

OK? Disclaimer over.

Besides the screen you get: an introduction with information about what\'s in 
the package, some hints on playing traveller and an blank equipment data sheet
to be photocopied;  Eight equipment data sheets detailing various and sundry
equipment (portable fusion generator, grav pack (back pack with grav modules),
map box, hand computer, fusion still, inertial locator, etc.) with 1 or 2
paragraphs of description, an illustration, 2 or 3 tasks for operation and
repair and statistics for several TL versions of the product with weight,
volume, price, power requirements, operating noise, and operating duration;
and 2 "folio" adventures which just means that they are short, they happen
to be two parts of one adventure taking place on Deyis II, an amber world of
Zarushagar sector (that\'s between Lucan\'s and Dulinor\'s territory)  You get
a subsector map and the usual bunch of tasks, player info, ref info, etc. in
seven pages.  They also included a piece of cardboard which is currently
backing the sheets in their new location in a plastic bag. The adventure looks
fine. As I said before, I hate screens so its nice they included extra things.

The screens are a set of two fold outs with six surfaces each. Some of the
information is for Ref\'s while others are for the Players.

Ref\'s side: 2 1/2 sides of combat.  This includes flow-charts which summarize
Megatraveller combat, range table, other tables and most of the tasks which
are used in combat.  There are a number of tables present which do not appear
in the rules but which summarize the information in the rules: Penetration/
attenuation Guide (%), Penetration and Damage (%), and Movement DM Guide. Some
are marked "simplied restatement of the rules" which was fine by me. It was
nice to see these rules summarized and all together for the first time; I\'ve
finally figured out how combat works.  Which begs the question, as to why the
Penetration and Damage table, for example wasn\'t presented the way it is on
the screen in the first place (pentration type cross level of success giving
the damage as a percentage to apply) in the rule books.

Someone went color happy with the typepography.  There are color bands beneath
the tables, the pages are not white, etc. You can actually read everything,
which would be much more difficult if everything was in black.

Ref\'s side: 1/2 page of interpersonal tasks. Everything except estimating
characteristics.

Ref\'s side: 1 page of demolition table. Identical to rules.

Ref\'s side: 2 pages of encounter tables. Identical to rules including Starship
tables from Imperial Encyclopedia.(but does not have explanatory passages)
All of the information is there. It is not cluttered and it is very readable;
thank the color.

Player\'s side: 2 pages of art and advertising. Including an illustration from
the folio adventure.

Player\'s side: 1 side Traveller\'s Guide, summarizing all the info in a UWP,
and what all those codes translate to (using Ref\'s Manual translations, so
the Atmosphere table has 0 Vacuum, 1 Vacuum (trace), etc.) With color panels
to make tables readable. Useful since you keep forgetting what the codes mean.

Player\'s side: 1 page Combat, with range table, hit value table and task
difficulty direct fire tables.  Yellow panels beneath every two other rows
allow you to see it.

Player\'s side: 1 page Task format explanation. Less useful info, since you
figure the player will know all of that before too long.

Player\'s side: 1 page with 2 maps of Third Imperium and Surrounds, cica 1116.
The *real* reason I bought this package.  There are two maps, one small scale
with the names of sectors, names of important worlds and political units. 
These are the smaller 7 across, 5 vertical maps (rather than the 7 x 7 ones
found in the books) only detailing the Third Imperium.  The borders are in
red ink and were done with a plotter--you can *see* the borders. I think I
finally figured out about the claw from looking at these maps.  The larger
maps shows *all* the borders and every star.  Yes "Every star system position
accurately shown" meaning each system gets a little black dot (Deneb, Vland,
Antares, etc. important worlds get red dots) so you can see the stellar
density right away.  You can also see all the borders. Unfortunately, besides
the ones listed on the map I couldn\'t identify any of them. I found the Droyne
worlds right away. I counted them; they\'re are twenty. Maps are great. But,
looking at the map, I wondered what are all these groups of 1, 2, 3, 15, etc.
systems on the borders.  Ah, for an atlas.

Summary: should you buy this? Only if you want it. Nothing is presented simply
for effect. They are well-presented and either identical to rules from the
books or summarized better than the rules were the first time. I think the
color makes it more readable. There are extra things included.  But of course
some of us *really* hate screens. (Sun was in my eyes, honest!)

Well, turn8 was a blast, and here is turn9, even more hints and clues coming 
your way....

*******************************************************************************

*******************************************************************************

1)  Well, this is it, everyone is caught up.  I\'ll post about 5 days late to
   both rec.games.pbm and the mailing list, only to let you guys not deal with
   reading it 3 times.

2)  I\'m going to remind you guys, if you haven\'t responded, 1 week and 2 days
   before the turn is due.  Or if everyone has responded except you.

	"Well, I must say, that that sounds like quite a reasonable price,"
replies the captain.
	"You bet it is," says Hubert coldly.  "It\'s just that I figure you and
this ship are worth it."
	"Um, captain ...," says Steve.  The captain turns to Steve and he 
whispers into his ear, "Are you sure you want to do this?  I mean this could
lead to even bigger troubles."
	"Trust me," says the captain quietly.  "Continue if you would Hubert,
you were about to tell us your line of work."
	"Well, as I was saying, I\'m not a pirate, and those guys aren\'t IBI 
agents.  My line of work is particular, I\'m ... how\'d you say it ... an obtainer
of antiquities, living or not.  Yeah, that\'s how I\'d put it."
	"So what have you obtained that requires my assistance?"
	"Well you see captain, those clowns who said they were IBI are the 
competition, not very good mind you, and they want what I\'ve got."
	"The crate," says Steve.
	"Exactly."
	"So what\'s in it?" questions the captain.
	"Well I\'ll tell you this, I went way out of my way to get it, and you\'ld
probably not even know what it was, if I told you."
	"Try me," says the captain.
	"You think your smart, huh.  Well ...."
	"I don\'t have to be, I\'ve got a computer library," remarks the captain.
	That catches Hubert off guard, and he continues, "yeah, you\'ve got one,
well then look this up in it, what\'s in the crate is a Coe (pronounced Kow-ee)
dog."
	"So why do they want it," asks Steve.
	"Because I got it first, and they didn\'t.  It was art really, their trap
was step up ...."
	"Thanks a bunch, now if you excuse me, I have to go open that crate up 
after ...."
	"What!" screams Hubert, jumping up.  Steve stands to full height and
Hubert semi-relaxes.
	"Well I have to see if you\'re telling the truth and ...."
	"You can\'t," says Hubert, looking very nervous.  "I mean the seal, if it
is broken, you might kill it.  It was to be opened someplace other than a cargo
hold on a ship."
	"Why?"
	"How do I know, I was just paid to get it.  The guy picking it up on 
Aramanx told me he\'d take care of unsealing it.  Has something to do with the 
dogs metabolic rate, or something like that."
	"Well we\'ll see what the computer says and then decide whether or not 
to open the crate."
	"NO!  You\'re not opening that crate.  You said no funny stuff, and that
includes not opening the crate."
	"What I agreed to ...."
	"Here," says Hubert, holding up a card, "take it all.  It\'s on the bank
card.  We agreed ...."
	Taking the card the captain continues, "I agreed to not to kill you,
that\'s all.  I\'m still the captain on this ship, and my laws hold.  You made an
agreement with me, for money, just to save your life, not your cargo.  I\'m fed
up with you and those idiots next door, just be lucky that I\'m still in a good
mood to let you live, because if I wasn\'t, I\'d turn you over to Moe and Curly.
Now I\'m going to open that crate with or without your permission, the only 
option you have is whether or not you want to be there."  The captain has worked
himself up, and starts to calm down, it\'s quite evident that he is venting all 
the frustration that has built up in the past few days.
	"Well then," says Hubert, "I don\'t want to be there, so at least I won\'t
be held responseable, see I get paid either way, dead or alive."
	"Good, just remember, you can\'t get paid if you\'re dead," says the
captain, startling Hubert.  Both Steve and the captain leave.

	"Well guys, before we go any further, let\'s look at our options, you  
know we got a lot of them," says Erc.
	"Yeah," says Samantha, "we should figure out what to do with all this,
maybe we should scan the computer for planets with this UPP."
	"That could take a while," says Erekosse.
	"But not if we limit the systems, like if we check only Lewis, and 
Aramanx, or maybe just this sector, or subsector," replies Samantha.
	"We could pump that chicken scratch, that Steve made up, into the 
computer also, see what it figures out," says Erc.
	"Well let\'s first go see how Moe and Curly are doing," says Erekosse, "
since we haven\'t heard from them, I think we better check up on them."
	"I\'ll go with you," says Erc.
	"I\'ll stay here and do the computer work," says Samantha.  "And Erc,
remember to block low," she continues with a giggle.  Erekosse chuckles a little
too, but Erc doesn\'t look pleased.

	Erc and Erekosse knock once and then enter Moe and Curly\'s stateroom, 
both are lying down on their beds, talking to one another, they both sit up as
you enter.
	"So what is it this time?" queries Moe.
	"Just checking up on our \'IBI\' agents," says Erc.
	"Okay already, we can cut the crap," starts Curly, "we aren\'t IBI agents
you\'ve probably figured that out already.  We\'re ...."
	"Yeah, you guys are to stupid to be IBI agents," says Erekosse.
	"What?" exclaims Moe.  "To stupid, I\'ll have you know that we went hell
of far to make this work, and if you\'ld just taken things for granted, none of
this would be happening, he probably owns your captain by now."
	"Who?" says Erekosse.
	"Oh, don\'t play stupid with us now," says Curly.  "You guys have to be
on his payroll now.  So what are you going to do with us, Jump Space exits, or
just regular space?"
	"I don\'t know what you\'re talking about," says Erekosse, "no one has 
bought anybody, and I\'m not for sale."
	"Look," says Moe, "we\'ll double whatever he\'s paying you."
	"We will," says Curly, giving Moe a quizical look.
	"Yeah, we will," says Moe.  "Look we\'re bounty hunters, and the guy
that Hubert\'s got in that crate is worth a hell of a lot, it\'s just a that we
caught him first, and Hubert stole him from us."
	"Who\'s in the crate?" questions Erc.
	"Should we tell them," says Moe to Curly.
	"Why not, you\'ve told them too much already.  Go ahead, tell the god-
damned universe for all I care, it\'s not gonna do us ...."
	"Okay," says Moe.  He motions both Erc and Erekosse closer, they both
lean towards him just a little, and he says, "Jason Pinter."  There is a look
of accomplishment on both of their faces.
	"Who the hell is that?" replies Erekosse.
	"Yeah, who is that?" says Erc.
	"You don\'t know?" questions Moe.
	"No, we don\'t," says Erc.
	"Well," starts Curly, "Jason Pinter happens to be the one and only, Yurl
Hagard.  We captured ...."
	"THE Yurl Hagard," says Erekosse is a shocked vioce, "are you certain,
100% sure."
	"Damn straight," says Moe, "see we got this lead ...."
	"We\'re outta here," says Erekosse.  And to Erc, "The captain has to know
about this, so let\'s go."
	"Fine," says Erc, and they both leave.
	"What did I say," says Curly to Moe, as Erc and Erekosse walk out the 
door.
	"Don\'t know," says Moe, "but I got a bad feeling about this."

	Samantha\'s fingers dance over the keyboard adjacent to the CRT.  There
is a long wait as the computer cracks the \'code\' that Steve wrote out.  After
about 5 minutes, the computer responds that there is no know language, or code
that converts this junk (Steve\'s words) into anything readable.  The computer
scan on the UPP\'s of the worlds brings up data on a world Regalis IV, but it
was destroyed in 997 when the star in it\'s system went SuperNova.  She types in
the data on Binary and asks the computer to take an \'educated\' guess at what it
means, the computer gives the standard definition of Binary, but also comes
up with these possibilites:

	Binary - a semi-posh restaurant chain that spans the Aramis Subsector
		 main worlds are Pysadi, Aramanx, ....

	Binary - sometimes used as a nickname for the BEDTR Co.  know as the
		 Binary Encoding Decoding Transmitting Recieving Comapny.  They
		 do secret transmission inside solar systems, and sometimes 
		 outside.  Used frequently by both the underworld leaders, and
		 Imperial government.

	Binary - Name given to a ship found floating through the Sword Worlds,
		 technology level was determined to be at least 20+.  No life
		 forms found onboard, ship disappered from the Imperial Impound
		 and is still believed missing.

	This is all she finds out.  You are all now in the common room again,
and you all begin to discuss your findings.

Subject: Passages

The idea of high, middle and low passages has bothered me for a while. If the
passages are not based upon the distance travelled, but instead a single jump,
rhe question is where do you get these tickets? The Traveller\'s Aid Society
gives them out as dividends to their members and it is doubtful whether every
tramp steamer spaceship sells them.  I thought that they might be sold by
finachial institutions and the T.A.S. in the same manner in which banks sell
Traveller\'s checks.  This would explain the lesser amount you get on a discount
and the reason why passages are accepted everywhere throughout space; they
are backed by the various banks throughout space.

	Passage tickets probably work similar to airline tickets
	today.  Most carriers will honor the tickets of another carrier
	(with the possible exception of Eastern Airlines) as a
	courtesy, and as a way to increase their own business.  It is
	assumed that the line which honors the ticket bills the
	issuer.

	This offers the possibility a couple of interesting angles to
	the game.  What if a major line goes T.U. after a tramp has
	accepted several passage tickets?  There may also be the
	possibility of major lines leveraging the small business owner
	into purchasing a special franchise or going out of business
	all together.

	A smart tramp operator may work in a high competition area with
	many major competing lines that cannot allow a bad reputation.
	Other possibilities are special contracts with certain lines,
	or accepting cash only.  I suppose you have to be on the
	look-out for Fly-By-Night Starlines tickets, too.

    ----

	I always assumed that the Traveller\'s Aid Society was kind of
	like Social Security or the Veterans Administration.  Probably
	closer to AARP - as a private organization.  One thing you have
	to remember is that it is HUGE.  Suppose 1 person out of 10,000
	in the Imperium pays (or has paid for them) the 1Mcr admission
	fee.  Assume resonable investment, assume also hotel, bar, and
	other revenues.  The society is probably LARGER than most
	(ALL?) Mega-corporations.  They maintain important economic and
	political contacts, possibly have their own fleet for internal
	travel and communication services, and DEFINITELY print their
	own scrip which is legal in most of the Imperial worlds.

	In the Shattered Imperium of Mega-Traveller, a good TAS

EDITOR\'S NOTE:

This is my first submission as editor of the TRADE & COMMERCE DIGEST.
Please send all replies on the subject of TRADE AND COMMERCE to:

givler@cbmvax.cbm.commodore.com

I plan to send issues out about every three days or if the volume is large
when the files reach about 45K. Below you will find Ed\'s reply to Mark\'s 
first article. What I would like to see is more on the same lines, then
we can work together to get a workable system that most, if not all, can 
use. I myself, have serious problems with the Mega-Traveller version 
of speculative trade. Below are some good Ideas, though they may require 
more detail than some of us would wish, or conversely not enough detail,
I think they are a good place to start. Again I ask that those who may be 
using a different version, than the book versions, let us know. I would 
like to see lots of different approaches so that we can all pick and choose 
what may work in our campaigns.

At least partially, however dependent on how realistic you wish
to make it -- the KISS principle may apply here [Keep It Simple,
Stupid!] -- you might want to include a *very* slim chance of
something like either a newly discovered, or very hostile, world
with an incredibly valuable resource.  Thus the population would
be low, the starport might not be the greatest, but the cargos would
still be quite good.

Yep.  Good idea.

Agreed.  Percentage modifiers are a good idea.  I also think they\'ll be
necessary, though as you say, could be cumbersom.

> 4) Contact owner (or agent) and haggle over price.

I don\'t know.  I\'ve never been one to enjoy haggling over price, unless
I think the price is outrageous.  With this system, you should come out
with a reasonable price.  If you still don\'t want it, that\'s your choice.
Perhaps there are other ships around that would be willing to bid?  (NOTE:
these should be other PLAYER ships!  Not NPCS!  Either that, or the GM
must be carefully honest, and keep the NPCS as though they were characters.
i.e. record how much money they have, how well they do selling, etc....)

> 5) Determine whether or not to buy.

Yep, you can\'t decide to buy until you know how much it\'s going to cost.
At least, not if you want to stay in buisness.....

Rush delivery?  Does that mean that we pay more if we force the owner/agent
to deliver to us sooner?  Do we get to impose penalties for failure to meet
the agreed delivery date?

About delivery dates:
    - Roll for the \'expected delivery date\'.
    - If that is too long for the ship to wait, allow the captain/owner
    of the ship to adjust the \'expected delivery date\' by specifing \'Rush
    Delivery\', and paying the percentage penalty.  If the adjustment is
    outrageous (more than 5 days?), allow a percentage chance that the
    owner/agent for the cargo will refuse.
    - If the original \'expected delivery date\' was too soon (ship servicing,
    etc..), allow the captain/owner to ask for \'Delayed Delivery\' by any
    number of days.  (No penalty to either side.)  Roll to see if the
    owner/agent of the cargo is willing to go along.  If the cargo is
    perishable, then degrade it\'s *resell* value by a percentage per day that
    it is delayed (1%?).  (Not the owner/agent\'s fault that the ship couldn\'t
    leave!)
    - Roll for the \'actual delivery date\' which should be a "bell curve"
    centered on the \'expected\' date.  actual = expected + (2D6 - 7)?
    The above formula would allow for -5 to +5 adjustment to the expected
    date.  Negative \'actual\' dates are really zero.  (The cargo is on-hand.)
    Penalties (10% per day?) apply to the owner/agent for failure to deliver
    on or before the specified time.  For perishable cargos, the owner/agent
    is penalized for early delivery, if the ship cannot leave early, at the
    same rate that the cargo is degraded.  (Not the captain/owner\'s fault that
    the owner/agent was over-eager!)

Depends!  On some worlds, particularly medium class worlds where cargo ships
are not common, but not unusual either, I would expect there to be \'factors\'
who would darn near meet each ship as it hit the ground.  (Consider
Renaissance(sp?) Italy, particularly Venice, were the trading was sharp and
quick.  Knowing when the next ship was going to come in and being there to
greet it first could make the difference between living and starving.)
On worlds with first class ports, and lots of traffic, the likelyhood of being
met is somewhat less, but not by much.  Only on worlds with low class ports,
and little traffic, are you likely to have to go looking real hard for a buyer.
Of course, the buyers who DO show up may not be interested in what you have
to sell!  I suppose that the KISS principle would cause this situation to
be combined into one roll, that would determine whether there\'s a buyer for
your cargo immediately, or wether you have to go looking.  The nature of your
cargo, and the world you\'re on makes a difference.  "Coal to NewCastle!"

> 2) Determine base offering price.  Take base resale value from master
>    table, apply appropriate modifiers from master table, roll on 
>    random value table (same table as in 3 above.)

I should think that the captain/owner would have a great deal to say about
how much he\'d sell his cargo for!  He just might opt to hold it over till
the next planet fall, if the price is lousy enough!

> 3) Select buyer and negotiate price.  See step 4 above.

If buyers are immediately present, and the roll was good enough, perhaps there
are multiple buyers present and willing to bid?

> 4) Decide to sell or not.

If you go the \'bid\' route, you\'ve little choice.  Though the captain/owner
can set a \'minimum\' bid that he\'ll accept.  To run an \'auction\', the
captain/owner must agree to pay the auctioneer a percentage based on the
final sale price.  If a \'minumum\' bid was posted, and the auction fails to
sell the cargo, the captain/owner must still pay the auctioneer the sale
percentage, but base it on the \'minumum\' posted bid.  (This is real life!)
Attempting to run an auction on your own, on a mid to high population world,
is virtually guaranteed to get a captain/owner in trouble....

> 5) Deliver as appropriate.  (In step 3, you agreed to deliver, and he
>    just didn\'t mention he\'s in a war zone.  Or the Teamsters are on
>    strike.)

Include a \'hazard\' clause in the agreement (if the captain/owner thinks
to ask for it) which lets him duck if the delivery would be \'too hazardous
for a proper captain to accept\'.  Include penalties for the owner/agent
for failure to inform the captain, and for the captain/owner for \'unreasonable
application of the hazard clause\'.  Maybe settled by arbitration?  Allow the
owner/agent to ask for a waiver of the \'hazard\' clause?

A few questions on starships in MegaTraveller.

1. The new explanation of jump drives (i.e. a large power plant driving a net
integral to the ship\'s hull) is official - it\'s in the Referee\'s manual.
Given this, why can\'t you damage a ship\'s jump capability with mere surface
damage? The starship combat damage tables are lifted straight from High Guard,
and you can only harm the target\'s jump drive with an internal explosion or
critical hit.

2. Can you use the jump drive\'s power plant as a source of a lot of power for
a short time? E.g. build a ship with a small meson gun. Its power plant can\'t
supply this weapon, but using the jump power plant gives you sufficient power
for a limited number of shots.

3. In High Guard, weapons with a USP factor of less than 10 get a +6 DM on the
damage tables which makes them do less damage. The same rule applies in MT,
although here the tables are backwards, and weapons of USP factor >=10 get
a +6 DM to make them do more damage. But in High Guard, USP factor 10+ only
occurs on spinal mount weapons. In MT, TL16+ turret and bay weapons may have
USP factors >=10. The upshot is that in High Guard, only spinal mount weapons
get the DM; in MT, high-tech bay and turret weapons may do so too. Am I missing
something, or is this a contradiction?

Does anyone know the origin of the Sword World\'s on the Spinward Marches map?
They sortof *jump* out at you (Beater, Biter, Sting, Sacnoth, etc.) and I was
wondering if anyone knew anything about their history.

Nope. I heard these questions asked at a con, and according to Miller et al,
the Lathimum (? is that correct? a rare earth metal I think) grid around the
hull is not that fragile; its basically a grid about the ship which is about
a meter apart, so the jump navigators can compensate if you are missing large
parts of it.  If you were actually missing large parts of your *hull* you
might be risking a misjump and have to deal with the possibility of having
a large hunk of jump space portrude into your ship. Not nice.

>2. Can you use the jump drive\'s power plant as a source of a lot of power for
>a short time? 

Definitely not!  Although the jump drive and the ship\'s power plant both supply
power they serve different requirements. The jump drive\'s burns all its fuel
very quickly and cannot sustain itself for the normal day to day run of the
ship\'s systems.  It cannot be altered to operated in any sort of "slow" mode.
And you cannot adapt the power plant to shunt energy through the crystals;
it just does not produce enough power, in the necessary amount of time.
You cannot adapt one to the other\'s use. If your jump drive and power plant are
gone, you are not dead yet; you\'ve got batteries so you still have air,
(although I\'d turn off the artificial gravity--it does kinda put a strain on
the power requirements)

Interestingly enough, jump is unlimited as far as how big a thing you want to
send.  At very high tech levels you can send entire planets through jump; its
an engineering problem rather than a theoretical one. Conceivably, you could
have some spare grid, put it around an interesting asteroid, modify your 
computers and jump with both your ship and the asteroid you had found.

The concept of the Sword Worlds comes from H. Beam Piper\'s book _Space_Viking_
(I didn\'t care much for it, although many of my friends enjoyed it.)  It\'s
a space opera.  Many of the names are retained (Gunn, Excalibur, Mithril,
et al) but more are added in Traveller.  Most of the other worlds are, of
course, named after swords.  Sting, Andruril, Narsil, etc from LOTR, Mjolnir,
etc from Norse mythos; Excalibur, etc from Arthurian legend; and so on.

Hope this is what you were looking for.

Well, the new, detailed task diagram on page 64 of the Starship Operator\'s
Manual states:

	[Step] 3 Navigator engages jump drive

	To engage the jump drive:
	Routine*, Engineer, Navigator\'s Edu (fateful)
	Referee: While the Navigator "pushes the button",
	both the engineer and the navigator monitor the jump
	transition together.  On a mishap, see Other Tasks.

	Inside 100 diameters, this task becomes difficult*
	(hazardous, fateful).

	Inside 10 diameters, this task becomes formidable*
	(hazardous, fateful).

	There is a high risk the jump field will not close if more
	than 10% of the ship\'s hull net is missing in any one
	location.  How could this happen?
	1. From any critical surface hit in starship combat.
	2. Compute percent of hull net damage = (number
	surface hits x 100) / hull disp
	   If this number is greater than 10, then high risk.

	In these cases, the task becomes...
	Difficult*, Engineer, Navigator\'s Edu (hazardous, fateful)

Original is Copyright 1988 Digest Group Publications.  Above quote was
reproduced without permission.

Looks like ten surface hits for each 100 tons displacement makes a jump
more difficult, and the result of a mishap hazardous.  A single critical
hit acts similarly.  All the above skills are marked with an asterisk,
meaning they must should be done "Cautiously", or the task becomes
uncertain and a warning light event may occur later on a result of Some
Truth.

Most of them are the names of mythological swords (hence Sword Worlds). I don\'t
recognise them all, but some are from Tolkien\'s books (e.g. Sting). Also present
is Excalibur. There also the unpopulated worlds with the names of metals.

Pity this isn\'t made clear in the Starship Combat section, where, as I said,
surface hits have no effect on jump capability (except by reducing fuel),
while a critical hit can wipe out the jump drive entirely. I\'d guess that the
critical hit knocks out the jump power plant. Interior explosions causing
jump damage may be doing damage to the net, rather than the drive.

All of which brings up another question. If a starship takes surface damage,
does it require a class A starport to repair it? Under the old system, no.
Only the jump drive required class A attention. But under the new system, the
hull is part of the jump drive. Which also means that simple surface repairs
become a lot more expensive, too.

That would take some fuel! Send Earth through hyperspace - use Jupiter as a
fuel tank. But hauling smaller loads around can be done. In the old Supplement
9, Fighting Ships, there is a jump tug which does exactly what you suggest -
puts a mesh around a load, e.g. a cargo pod or a small asteroid, then pulls it
through a jump.

"The Sword Worlds where the men are men and the women are men too..."

The above is from an article for Journal No. 18 entitled
Contact: Sword Worlders, according to the article SW\'s are decended from 
Solomani Exiles which arrived in the subsector ca. -400 they first settled at 
Gram in -399. Although not part of the Imperium they did take advantage of 
Imperial trade, until the First Frontier War where Imperial alliances with the
Darian Confederation brought the Sword World and Darian problems to a head. 
This tension continues to this day. The article was written in 1108 or so, in 
and around the Fifth Frontier War. The Sword Worlds are part of The OutWorld 
Coalition.

The original settlers of the Sword Worlds were of Germanic and Nordic stock.
The official language is a variant of Icelandic. Each world of the Sword 
Worlds has a different culture although all are male dominated and any 
women in "male" jobs are expected to exhibit male rather than female behavior,
at least in public. Which leads to the statement at the beginning of this
article.

Psionics are not repressed as they are in the Imperium, but they are not 
an integral part of society either, like the Zhodani. Psi powers are viewed
with distaste by Sword Worlder men, and any male with them will be reluctant
to admit to them or use them in public. 

The Sword World Confederation is a true confederation with individual systems
having complete autonomy. Each world maintains their own armed forces and 
makes their own laws and completely regulates their own internal affairs. A
Confederation Council, made up of representatives on all the worlds. It 
regulates interworld trade and so forth. The so-called "metal worlds" (Iron,
Bronze, Mithril and Steel) have been designated resource worlds, and placed
under the direct administration of the Confederation government for further
development. [As an aside, if any of you have been run in Mission on Mithril, 
you know what these worlds are like. What a night that was for my character.]
There are no permanent inhabitants, just members of the Confederation Patrol
and various mining and resource company employees. 

Character generation is the same as for normal Imperial citizens, however the
Scout Service is replaced by the Patrol Service. 

The above is excerpted(sp?) and paraphrased from 
_The Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society_
No. 18, article _Contact: Sword Worlders_ by Loren Wiseman.

There is a character class, Patrol Service, that if people wish to have, I 
will issue a follow up article, I do not know if this issue of the _Journal_
is still available. If there is a request, I will be glad to type in the 
Patrol Service character class, there is also a chronology of the Sword Worlds.
Let me know if anyone wants the chronology too.

The Sword Worlds was a background created by H. Beam Piper for his space epics.
The only book in the series I recall that mentioned the Sword Worlds explicity
in _Space Viking_.  Pretty good story, actually.

The GDW Sword Worlds are not detailed anywhere, so I use stats based on H. Beam
Piper\'s work.  The names used on the Spinward Marches map correspond to most
famous named swords, ("Beater" and "Biter" being the orc names for "Orchrist,
the Goblin Cleaver" and "Glamdring, the Foe Hammer" from _The Hobbit_.  "Sting"
was Bilbo\'s name for his dagger/sword.  Other names mentioned on the map
include Excalibur and Durandal, I believe (or maybe they\'re from Piper and
I\'m just confusing the two).  Durandal was the sword of Roland, I presume you\'ve
heard of Excalibur.

I am in the process of writing an adventure for Digest Group
which deals with ship operations in the Old Expanses sector,
my old High Passage stomping ground, which is now under
Solmani control. I would like some opinions as to how difficult
it would be to operate a ship in the system without being
detected. Part of this is solved by having only a small occupation
force in the system (how convenient!), and certain areas (such as
the main world and gas giants) would be impossible to get near
without being detected. The question is how much of the system
is being watched. Is there a sort of equivalent to the current
air traffic control system? How easy would it be for the Solomani to
set up such a system? Any ideas?

It is mentioned somewhere in the Megatraveller books that at high TLs

teleportation became intersystem capable and was used by ancients. In
the Traveller  Adventure "Secret of the Ancients" it is noted that the
Ancients used entire suns as source of energy by "pinching" them out of normal

space and then carrying along this pinched sun as a poerplant for their
ships!!!
At these TLs you wouldn\'t need to put a mesh around the sun/gas giant just
pinch it off and put a tap on the emitted energy. Wouldn\'t need to refuel for
atleast 5 billion years!!!

I\'ve just finished re-reading "The Mote in God\'s Eye" by Larry Niven and James
Pournelle, and was struck by the similarities between Moties and Droyne.
Both are caste-based societies, and most of the castes match, e.g. Droyne
Leaders = Motie Masters, Droyne Technicians = Motie Engineers. Droyne don\'t
have miniature Watchmakers (that we\'ve seen), and their Drones don\'t have any
Motie equivalent that I recognised, though. Still, it set me thinking about
resolving the Riddle of the Ancients in terms of Moties. Anything is better
than the official explanation, so try this.

In their earlier times, the Droyne had the same problem as the Moties. They had
to reproduce, or they would die. This led to immense population problems, which
were solved to some extent when the Jump Drive was invented. "Some extent"
means that it was only a matter of time before the worlds which were colonised
were also overcrowded. Inevitably, interstellar war resulted, but not before
the Droyne had reached very high tech levels. Some colonies were wiped out;
others were blasted back to a Stone Age equivalent. Bases were left behind,
some intact, others ruined. No two bases were ever the same, as no two Droyne
did the same thing the same way.

Civilisations rose and fell several times before one Droyne, the Yaskoydray of
legend, formed a new society in which the needs of society totally overrode
the wishes of individuals. If an individual had to reproduce or die, and no
more children were needed by society, tough - the individual died. The impact
was lessened to some extent by the discovery of a hormone-control drug which
counteracted the biological need to reproduce. Yaskoydray tested this first on
himself, and when it appeared to be effective, issued it to his society.

Other societies were divided in their opinions of these developments. Some
welcomed the apparent end to millenia of rises and falls, of creation followed
by destruction. Others were reluctant to take the step into an entirely new
system. There was one more, cataclysmic war. Yaskoydray\'s side won, but it was
a Pyrrhic victory, as the few survivors were once more reduced to primitive
levels. Most of the survivors were on only two worlds, Andory and Candory. A
few isolated groups exist throughout space, but very small groups.

While the survivors of Andory and Candory were struggling to revive their
society, a new factor made itself felt. Humanity was, for the first time, also
capable of jump travel. The Imperials were the first to discover the twin
worlds. Their archaeologists learnt a few fragments of the above history;
enough to regard the Droyne as a potential threat, but only potential. There
was no reason to exterminate them, but they had to be watched in case they
expanded again.

In fact, there is no such threat. The concept of the individual being totally
subordinate to society is still in force. The hormone control drug was lost,
along with much of the Ancients\' technology, but the rigid society attitude,
backed up by quasi-religious rituals such as those of the coynes, keep the
population in check. An individual lives just as long as it is needed by
society, then it dies. A few choose not to die, but they soon run into the
old problem. They have to breed, or they become listless and unhappy, and
eventually die anyway. But so long has it been since anyone bred for that
reason, that none know the cause of their unhappiness; and besides, none except
perhaps another one of these "deathless ones" will have anything to do with
them.

There is a legend which persists, that Yaskoydray is alive and well, and
occasionally visits the Droyne. The presence of coynes which cannot be
otherwise explained lends some credence. In truth, although none but Yaskoydray
himself know it, when he first tried the hormone control drug on himself, he
overdosed. But as the need to reproduce or die was nature\'s way of trying to
keep Droyne from living too long, and as he has overcome that need, he is in
effect immortal. Which does not make him very happy; even Ancients can get
tired of life when they\'ve seen everything. Yaskoydray has seen more, and knows
more, than the sum total of the experience of all the human subspecies put
together. He\'s also slightly cowardly. He won\'t commit suicide, or take actions
which threaten him. Thus he is tired of life, but afraid to die.

Well, there you have it. Yet another Theory of the Ancients. Any comments?
Interesting side note, as this is inspired by "The Mote in God\'s Eye"; there
is a star called "The Eye Of God", or more correctly, "L\'Oeuil d\'Dieu". (That
high school French had some use, after all! :-) What a pity this star is on
the wrong side of the Spinward Marches.

Digest Editor\'s Notes:
- ----
This is digest #3 in the continuing star system generation saga...
The subject of this digest is a summary of the previous two digests, and
this digest will be concluded with the latest release of James Perkins\'
"gensec" and "mapsub" programs for generating and mapping sectors and
subsectors. Also, I wil use elipses (...) to indicate editing I have
done to shorten messages.

        ---->>> Help the Star System Generation Digest! <<<----
There is a reason that this digest is a summary of the prvious two, 
namely that the only submission I received since I started coordinating
this discussion group has been James\' update. Doesn\'t anybody
out there have anything to say about what they want in an automatic
sector, subsector, system, planet... generating/mapping system? 

The persons in these discussions are as follows:
      Rob Miracle    <rwmira01%ulkyvx.bitnet@RELAY.CS.NET>
      James Perkins  <jamesp@dadla.la.tek.com>
      Fred Schiff    <vu0141@bingvaxu.cc.binghamton.edu>

All discussion and followups should be sent to those listed above and myself
(Bill Morrison <morrison@pyr.gatech.edu>).

Also, I have a copy of the program mentioned in the digest 1 summary that
describes a planet down to the minutest detail (such as surface temp, stellar
mass, and almost *any* other piece of information you might want). If there
is any demand for this program, I\'ll post it in the next digest. This
program is based upon real planetary sciences. Here are the estimated 
run-times of this program on various systems:

    2-5 seconds user time on an HP9000/350
    5-30 seconds on a Sun-3/60
    4 minutes on an 8 MHz PC
    7 minutes on a normal PC

                       ----

First Topic - generation of trade and X-boat routes:

There was a discussion between Fred Schiff and James Perkins about coding 
the current gensec/mapsub software system and the problems involved with 
adding trade and X-boat routes. The system given in the ORIGINAL boxed
version of Traveller uses the following table:

>                        JUMP ROUTES

The discussion tried to define what requirements would necessitate trade 
and X-boat routes such as class of starport, density of inhabited worlds, 
trade classes of worlds (agri, indust, etc.). For trade routes, all worlds 
should somehow be connected (graph theory anyone?) in some manner using 
\'classes\' of trade routes (refer to the recent discussion in the trade 
discussion group). As for X-boat routes, that is going to be tougher since 
they have more requirements (Class of star port, supporting scout/navy 
base, and that the bases X-boats do connect to have connections to the 
rest of the subsector). Additionally, there is no rule saying that X-boat 
routes have to follow trade routes. This makes the job even harder. 
Both Fred and James thought that using graph theory was the way to go. You 
could have files list edges and vertices and with various programs do things 
like "what\'s the fastest/most scenic route to ...".  Another problem with 
this is scope. There could be thousands of systems in a database.

The followings is an excerpt between James and Fred on this topic:

>> containing the sector info. But its limited. Where do I put the
>> routes that ships go through. ...in the case of war or invasion
>> or general chaos I think I\'d just like to know *all* the various
>> routes through the star-lanes...
>
>Ah... now you\'re exactly where I\'ve been at; how to manage all this data.
>
>> ...How do I deal with it when I want an extended generation for a 
>> star system (I don\'t have too do that for every star, just the ones
>> I want to deal with) Last, how do the sectors fit together? Certainly
>> thats not a big problem, since you are only dealing with one at a
>> time usually, but wouldn\'t it be nice.
>
>Yeah, I\'ve put a little thought into all these.

                      ----

Second Topic: Representation of all information in a common database

Of course, how do you store all of the information you\'ve created about your
sector/subsector/system/planet? This database should have a mechanism for
storing any information at any scale (this includes the trade and X-boat
routes mentioned above, and anything considered important like capitals,
megacorps - there is even thought of storing world *maps* in this database
[Ed.- graphical representation takes a *large* amount of storgage space and
most of the system our readers will be using are PCs if I\'m not mistaken]).

The discussion between Fred and James went like this:

>> Umph. Could use grid files, but since the maps aren\'t really maps, but
>> diagrams of locations that might be wasteful... Each star system
>> could have an optional text field for a paragraph of info...
>
>Paragraph of info?  Heck, I figure if someone wants to get verbose about
>anything they should be able to put a whole file of info in on anything.
>That\'s why I think you should be able to comment any sort of object (Sector,
>Subsector, System, Star, Planet, Moon, Etc.)
>
>Yeah, world maps would be optional, in fact I think you should be able
>to fill stuff out from the top down.  Oh, you want to look at THIS
>subsector? Quick... generate all the systems in it, stow it away.  And
>you want to look at THIS system\'s extended generation stuff? Quick,
>generate the expanded system data, stow it away.  Oh, a world map, QUICK,
>generate a world map at the grainy level.  This region?  Quick, generate a
>regional map... etc.

James Perkins had the following idea about the data representation:

>Concerning the database thing: not a complete solution, but how about, for
>every system you have 3 files:
>  name.sector (mainworld generated sector info)
>  name.xboats (xboats routes in sector name)
>  name.extend (additional info on world I\'m interested in)
>
>One thing we want to be careful to avoid is duplicating information.  We
>should try to work out a single "Key" data item...
>
>         Name.sector     Sector name, Subsector names, and all system UWP\'s
>         Name.routes     Xboat, trade, and other routes
>        .expand - expanded system data for systems
>        .text - commentary on sector, subsector, systems, worlds
>        .map - world map information for individual worlds
>
Their idea here is to have one file for each sector and for each layer of
detail. 
 
This way, you could tailor the database to the scale an individual group
wants for their campaign. Lets face it, some groups don\'t need all that
realism, and referees don\'t want to create places where the players will
never go.  

Rob Miracle also has brought up the point of checking a systems data for
consistency with itself. Has he pointed out, the rules allow you to do a lot
of things that don\'t occur in the physical universe. Here\'s an excerpt from
his message:

>...Eventhough, Dinomn (or Dinome) can not exist by the rules.  I 
>am sorry, you just can\'t have a type 6 atmosphere when you are in orbit 
>one around an M6 Dwarf, even though the rules say you can, it is just too 
>darned cold (Something like 79 degrees Kelvin), Yes Virginia, Oxygen 
>does freeze.

Rob also pointed out that "portability" doesn\'t mean that everyone has
access to a Unix/VMS/"insert favorite mini here".

>For simplicity sake, we need to keep what ever format ASCII and under 80 
>characters and one line per system, but I would like to code in some 
>orbital information as well.  (My I ask alot).


                      ----

Third Topic: Operations on the data in the database

Here are some of the ideas that James came up with:

>We also need to talk about clever programs which operate on the data.
>I can think of lots of programs to emit postscript:
>
>     sector2ps - Sector map of systems, ala the Spinward Marches map
>     routes2ps - Sector map transparency overlay for each kind of trade
>                 route
>     extend2ps - Program to format extended information pages
>
>You\'d use the above to create pages for a 3-ring binder, for example.
>
>Browsing programs (ascii output):
>
>        showsub - show a subsector map
>        showsys - show UWP of system and expansion data
>        showsysroutes - show map of vicinity around a system with routes
>
>As well as programs which do generation:
>
>        gensec - generates sectors
>        namesec - replaces "Unnamed" on everything with random names
>        expandsys - generates expanded data for a system, adds into
>                    name.expand
>        genroutes - generate automatic routes
>        annosys, annosub, annosec - add anotation text to the .expand file
>
>Maybe one big master program that gives you different windows onto the
>data, allows selections and operations via a graphics interface on a Mac
>or Sun.

Rob Miracle has modified a program for MT style output. This program is for
sector display. Here\'s what he says:

> I will probably post my Sector Display program soon. I have to clean it 
> up a bit.  It uses the sector format given in MT:Book 3 for the Spinward 
> Marches. The program reads this file and asks for your starting location.
> It then displays a hex map, with you world in the center and all surronding
> worlds and their UWP.  It then ask for your destination and tells you about
> it, displays any specific data and the gives passenger and trade information
> going to that world.
> Now the bad part, it is written in Turbo Pascal V4.0 or V5.0. It requires
> at least 640X400 resolution meaning you need an AT&T PC6300 or a PS/2 or
> PC with a VGA card.  Do you think there will be an interest in it?

                       SUMMARY OF DIGEST #2
                       ----

First Topic - ideas for Database approach for system/etc generation:

These ideas are from Fred Schiff and James Perkins.

Purpose: provide the capability to create any number of systems at any layer
         of resolution. This includes the generation of sectors, subsectors,
         systems, planets (including asteroid belts), moons, and maps
         (planetary, regional, and local). 

Requirements:
          Any of this items should be annotated by the user. 
          Any layer should be optional.
          All data fields within the database should be of variable length.
          Avoid duplication of information.
          Fields should be delimited by a character (a la /etc/passwd)

The following are suggested files/tables for the database:
    Name.{filetype}
        .sector - UWP\'s, sector, subsector, and system names
        .routes - trade, xboat, other routes
        .expand - expanded system data for systems
        .text - commentary on sector, subsector, systems, worlds
        .map - world map information for individual worlds
        .key - (optional) explanation & code for each new base code,
               classification data and alegiance code used in .sector file;
               used to make explanation key box in outputs

The following are suggested programs to operate on the database:
     Postscript Output Programs:
        sector2ps - Sector map of systems, ala the Spinward Marches map
        sub2ps    - SubSector map of systems, ala Digest Group map
        routes2ps - Sector map transparency overlay for each kind of trade
                    route
        extend2ps - Program to format extended information pages

     Browsing Programs (ASCII output)
        showsub - show a subsector map
        showsys - show UWP of system and expansion data
        showsysroutes - show map of vicinity around a system with routes

     Generation Programs
        gensec - generates sectors
        namesec - replaces "Unnamed" on everything with random names
        expandsys - generates expanded data for a system, adds into
                    name.expand
        genroutes - generate automatic routes
        annosys, annosub, annosec - add anotation text to the .text file

And of course we need some sort of menu program to tie everything together.

End of STAR SYSTEM DIGEST #2 Summary
- ----

The following is James Perkins\' latest and greatest mapsub/gensec
programs. Enjoy!

     *****   *****   *****   *****   *****   *****   *****

Here are two new revisions of old programs: gensec, and mapsub.

Gensec is a sector generator.  The new features are that it\'s
MegaTraveller compatible, allows you to generate a single sector at a
time, and allows you to specify system density and sector maturity with
words (rift, sparse, dense, mature, frontier, etc.).  It also has a UWP
format compatible with MegaTraveller, with the population multiplier,
gas giant and planetoid counts.  It also logs the version of the format
in the output file, so that other programs can recognize what version of
gensec output they have.  An acknowledgement goes to Fred Schiff for
supplying the changes to this program.

Mapsub is a subsector mapping program.  It takes one subsector\'s worth
of gensec output and turns it into a hex map of the subsector.  Two
modes of output are supported: ascii, in which the hexes are drawn with
standard ascii symbols like underscore, slash, backslash, and asterisk;
and postscript, suitable for sending to most postscript devices.  This
program has been totally rewritten and is much more maintainable,
readable, and expandable than it used to be.  It can easily be adjusted
to add other forms of output or formats of input.  Acknowledgements are
due to Fred Schiff for supplying changes to the old version of mapsub,
and to Yngve Larsson for the postscript additions.  It also fixes the
bug where the hex staggering was incompatible with the Traveller rules.

I\'ve tested these on a Sun 3/60 running SunOS 4.0, and a VAX 11/780
running BSD.  Make sure if you run any system that uses index() in place
of strchr() or random() in place of rand() that you compile with the
- -DBSD option.  Particularly, the BSD rand() output looks very flaky and
using random() is MUCH better.  For example, an entire sector of worlds
ALL had only ODD numbers for world sizes, when I didn\'t use the -DBSD
option.  

If you come up with any fixes/additions/suggestions, please let me know
and I will happily graft them in.

Known Bug: The mapsub program produces postscript output which works
fine on a Data Products Laser Printer, but not on a Apple LaserWriter.
Any help? Suggestions?

So, without further ado:

    gensec - a simplistic traveller sector generator

    Simplistic Traveller sector generator, based on Marc Miller,
    "Traveller Sector Generator", Using Your Model 2/BIS, Challenge
    No.  25; and other Traveller material (Referee\'s Manual and
    issues of Traveller\'s Digest.)

    The format of the output of gensec is a superset of the material
    produced by Mr.  Miller\'s published program.  It now conforms to the
    format in the MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual p.  16, except the
    travel zone has been put last similar to entries in Traveller\'s
    Digest.

    This program rewritten C and Unix Aug 18 1987 by James T. Perkins.
    (jamesp@dadla.la.tek.com, @uunet.uu.net:jamesp@dadla.la.tek.com)

    Additions made Mar 17 1989 by Fred Schiff
    (vu0141@bingvaxu.cc.binghamton.edu) to conform with Basic generation
    in MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual.

 * NAME
 *	mapsub - Traveller Subsector Mapper
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *	mapsub [ -a | -p ] < Subsector.dat
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	This program takes Traveller subsector world data and converts it
 *	into a subsector map, either ascii or postscript.  Each subsector
 *	hex has the following data in it:
 *
 *	          ______
 *	         / XXYY \\	<- Hex number
 *	        /  * S T \\	<- *=Naval base, S=Starport class, T=Tech level
 *	       /  ^ @ .   \\	<- ^=Scout base, @=Liquid world, O=Desert
 *	       \\  System  /	   world, %=Asteroids, .=Gas giant presence
 *	        \\  Name  /	<- System Name
 *	         \\______/	<- CAPITOL, Capitol, RED, or amber travel zones
 *
 * OPTIONS
 *	-a	Produce Ascii output, like the above.  This is the default.
 *	-p	Produce Postscript output.  Looks much more like the real
 *		format published in the Spinward Marches map.
 *
 * FILES
 *	This program depends on two files being available:
 *
 *	./mapsub.hex	- contains an ascii hex grid, which is filled in
 *			  with world data by mapsub.
 *			  This file\'s pathname may be easily changed by
 *			  changing the MAP_TEMPLATE #define.
 *	./mapsub.pro	- contains postscript function definitions which
 *			  are needed to plot the worlds efficiently.
 *			  This file\'s pathname may be easily changed by
 *			  changing the PS_PROLOGUE #define.
 *	Subsector.dat	- the input file (actually this program eats whatever
 *			  it is given on its stdin).  The format can be in
 *			  one of two formats; version 1 format or version 2
 *			  format:
 *
 *	VERSION 1 format: The first line of the file is "#Version: 1".
 *	Each following line of input is 59 characters long, as follows:
 *
 *	"XXYY System_Name_______ CSAHPGL-T B Trade_Codes____ Al Z GP"
 *
 *	Version 1 is still around, so that data generated with the old
 *	version of gensec can still be used.
 *
 *	VERSION 2 format: The first line of the file is "#Version: 2".
 *	Each following line of the file is 60 characters long, as follows:
 *
 *	"System_Name_______ XXYY CSAHPGL-T B Trade_Codes____ MPG Al Z"
 *
 *	Version 2 supports most of the MegaTraveller changes, except it
 *	does not have the star information.  It is the current version of
 *	the gensec program\'s output.
 *
 *	Fortunately, if there are a few additional columns of data added to
 *	the right, this program can tolerate the change.
 *
 * BUGS
 *	Ascii output looks passible, but not terrific.
 *	Postscript output looks terrific, but does not indicate world capitals.
 *
 * AUTHOR
 *	James T. Perkins, jamesp@dadla.la.tek.com
 *
 * HISTORY
 *	Based on an earlier program by James Perkins.
 *	Fred Schiff (vu0141@bingvaxu.cc.binghamton.edu) added MegaTraveller
 *	capability to the original mapsub.  Yngve Larsson (yla@ida.liu.se)
 *	added postscript output to the original, and authored the mapsub.pro
 *	file.  James Perkins then rototilled the original program and made
 *	it much more modifiable, incorporating the changes by Fred and Yngve.
 *	This is now the latest version.

I have been running a campaign for about a year, off and on, in the Solomani
Rim Sector. I have been avoiding the Vegan Autonomous Region, mainly because
I dont have any info on the Vegans, aside from the sketchy info in the Sector
book. I have not been to a gaming store in quite awhile, I know, shame on me,
so I do not know if GDW has published anything on the subject. Does anyone out
there know if there is an "official" character generation on the Vegans.

Thanks,

Greg

I received two copies of must of the stuff you sent out on the 19th.  It

TRADE & COMMERCE DIGEST VOL.3

CONTENTS:

1. LETTER FROM EDITOR - GREG GIVLER
2. IDEAS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADE - MARK A. POWER
3. SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE - JCUNNING?

1. LETTER FROM EDITOR

Hi, and welcome to VOL.3 of the Traveller Trade and Commerce Digest. Anyone
who missed volumes 1 and 2 and are just dying to get caught up, let me know 
and I will be glad to send out back issues. We are still light on articles, and 
need more input from all over. Before I took over this job it seemed that 
every other article on the mailing list was talking about Trade and Commerce.
Now nothing, if we have covered everything let us know and we can always go 
back to cluttering the net waves with tons of useless information, I know I 
enjoy reading it. :-) If you have any ideas let us know, if they are silly we\'ll
let you know. If they are good, we\'ll let you know that too. I am an 
information gatherer, a packrat if you will. I don\'t want to lead a discussion
that should lead itself. But I dont think that we on the net, who run Traveller,
have come to the conclusion that everything is fine with the system. 
Let\'s hear what you have to say!

The contents of the digest this time consist of Mark Powers reply to the reply
in digest 2 from Edwin Wiles, which was a reply to Marks original system 
suggestions. I think that Mark\'s orginal statements showed alot of thought and
Edwin\'s reply gave very contructive criticism, and added good points to expand
on. Mark has some thoughts on what Edwin said last time. So read and if 
something strikes you (like a 2-TON weight) then get on your soapbox and 
pontificate a bit, (like this :-)

About the Structure of the Digest, I have tried to set the contents up
so that you can use search functions in you respective editors to get around 
the digest more easily. I will have the title of the article which you can
search for or the authors name. That way you can avoid my ramblings.

Greg

2. From: "MARK A. POWER" <uunet!asnuab.asn.net!uabmap01>
Subject: Re: Ideas for Speculative Trade

My original remarks (from Digest #1) are quoted as
\'>>\', Ed\'s comments are marked \'>\'.

Before my detailed response, I\'d like to say one of my biggest
complaints with both the Book 2 and Merchant Prince/MegaTraveller
systems is the that both are exercises in rolling dice -- there is not
much call for role-playing in the process.  Adding steps where the
referee could slip in an adventure, and in general keep the players on
their toes, could only help.

[stuff edited - Greg]

I agree this step should be at the players option.  My idea was to add
an opportunity for role-playing into the process, as well as a place
to use that Broker-3.  If the players don\'t have anyone with suitable
skills, they might be best to skip this.  

Re: Bidding.  I don\'t have any other player ships around.  I think it
would be adequate to play the NPC\'s intelligently.  If the players are
prepared to buy a cargo at Cr 10,000 per ton, knowing they have a good
chance to sell it J-1 away at Cr 25,000 per ton, then it is probable
that another captain will be willing to pay Cr 15,000 per ton.  The
main purpose of this is to adjust for unusual conditions, and to
attempt to reflect market forces.  Perhaps the referee could generate 
a random ship type for the competitors, and range of available capital 
for each type.  This would give you a general idea of their resources,
and give the players a chance to make those large profits, without
losing to some clown with an unlimited bank account.

>> 6) Determine delivery date.  Allow rush delivery at [some premium]

This is one of the few good ideas I stole from MegaTraveller.  I
believe MT gives a standard delivery date as 4 days from the date of
the purchase.

> Rush delivery?  

> About delivery dates:
>     - Roll for the \'expected delivery date\'.
>     - [ Allow captain to specify rush delivery, at price.  Allow
>         chance of seller telling captain to stuff it. ]
>     - ...Allow captain to ask for \'Delayed Delivery\' [at no penalty].

Note that it if the cargo is sitting in a warehouse, it is to the seller\'s 
benifit to deliver it ASAP - warehouse space costs money!  If he is
waiting on delivery himself, it\'s a different matter.  I do like the
way of handling perishables.

>     - Roll for the \'actual delivery date\' which should be a "bell curve"

Overall, I like this.  I think this would be a good place to start.

>> SALE
>> ----
>> 1) Find a buyer.
> Depends!  On some worlds, ... 

Hmm....  I\'ve been assuming we would produce a system optimized for
small ships - free traders, 400-ton subsidized merchants, and so on,
though workable for larger ships.  I would think that, while factors
might be waiting when you arrive, he\'d be interested in a commission,
not in purchasing your (rather small) cargo.  Another factor (:-) is
role-playing -- I see this as another opportunity for role-playing, as
well as one for starting adventures.  If the players never have to leave
the ship, it\'s a lot more difficult to get them in trouble.  Comments,
anyone?

>> 2) Determine base offering price.

> I should think that the captain/owner would have a great deal to say about
> how much he\'d sell his cargo for!

Sure, he\'d have final say on how much he\'ll sell for; he just doesn\'t
have any say over how much he\'s offered.

>> 3) Select buyer and negotiate price.  See step 4 above.
> 
> ...Perhaps there are multiple buyers present and willing to bid?

Seems reasonable.

>> 4) Decide to sell or not.
>
[ Good details on auctions omitted...]
> Attempting to run an auction on your own, on a mid to high population world,
> is virtually guaranteed to get a captain/owner in trouble....

There\'s the sort of thing I like to see -- something to provide some
variety.

>> 5) Deliver as appropriate.
>
> [ More excellent ideas ommitted ]

I wouldn\'t use this very often - just enough to keep things interesting.

[editors note: I didn\'t know who to give credit to this article to, 
but I am including it anyway. This may not seem like a Trade and Commerce
discussion, but I think it applies. Basically the question is this, how
do you determine how well a star system is patrolled, and how fast help
will arrive to a distress call. I have it suit my needs, in other words if
the players look like they NEED help, it arrives just in the nick of time. 
If they are doing OK without "my" help then they won\'t get it. Conversely
what if you have a group that is getting into pirating, my present group is
leaning that way, how do you handle it when the good guys are now the bad guys!
If you think this article is way off line let me know and I wont go off on a
tangent grasping at straws. Let me know what you think.]

I am in the process of writing an adventure for Digest Group
which deals with ship operations in the Old Expanses sector,
my old High Passage stomping ground, which is now under
Solmani control. I would like some opinions as to how difficult
it would be to operate a ship in the system without being
detected. Part of this is solved by having only a small occupation
force in the system (how convenient!), and certain areas (such as
the main world and gas giants) would be impossible to get near
without being detected. The question is how much of the system
is being watched. Is there a sort of equivalent to the current
air traffic control system? How easy would it be for the Solomani to
set up such a system? Any ideas?

See supplement 11, Library Data N-Z for more info on the Vegans. No character
generation is provided, but it will give you some background on them and
provides you with a couple of drawings of them. At one time Andy Keith was
going to be writing some stuff about them in a boxed module on how to
create your own minor race as well as background on minor races mentioned 
until that time (which was around 1983. Needless to say, the project was
never developed, and GDW dropped the boxed module format due to lack of
sales.

There is a little more information on the Vegans in the GDW supplement "Library
Data N-Z". It contains the same information as in the Sector book (I assume
that this is the GDW supplement "The Solomani Rim"), plus enough biological
stuff to give you the skill Vegan Medic-1. Having said that, I found the
"sketchy" info sufficient to allow human characters to wander around, although
I can\'t generate Vegan NPC\'s except by using human tables. Still, the Alien
Module character generation tables are virtually identical to the human ones.

Does anyone out there feel that the Megatraveller ship design system
actually works? In the process of writing the adventure for Traveller\'s
Digest, I finally had to learn the new systems for design and combat.
I hate to say it, but I don\'t like them. Call me a relic from the
old Traveller days. I don\'t care. I think that a) the rules need to be
edited and text added to explain the design process and b) the added
complexity is not worth the added realism. I think that grafting on the
sensor rules onto High Guard and cleaning up the combat system would
have been a much better way to go. 

As a result of all this, I think that I will henceforth playtest the
adventure using old Traveller and then convert it into Megatraveller
for publication. Opinions?

By the way, has anyone out there converted the 200 ton Solomani patrol
frigate (or some such type) into Megatraveller from Alien Module 6?

I want to thank those who replied to my plea for aid. Looks like I will have
to dig up supplement Library Data N-Z. BTW, if any one is interested in a
PC generation of Vegans, I will be working on one in the near future. If 
any of you have any ideas please dump them my way.

I agree.  In order to create a large merchant ship I spent 2-3 days poring
over that information.  At the end, I got a useable ship but I find that
it has quirks in that I made it more powerful than any merchant ship has
any right to be.  Guidelines along "this constitutes a merchant", "this
constitutes a pirate corsair", "this is a blockade ship", etc would be
nice.

It would also be nice if, for interior design, there were some templates
for the engines, jump drives etc.

Well, I don\'t mind the complexity as long as it isn\'t something you
have to do on the spur of the moment.  Imagine trying to do it while
adventuring :-)   I haven\'t tried the combat yet.  What is it like?

>As a result of all this, I think that I will henceforth playtest the

My gut feeling is that it will be painful.  I am currently running
"Murder on Acturus Station" as a MT adventure and it took too long
to map the Traveller descriptions, needed rolls, etc into MT tasks
and so forth.

First off, I banged this turn out real quick.  I\'m sorry for the typos, and
the format, I think it could be better.
But it\'s got lot\'s of excitement, so onto the turn.

- ----

Here is turn 11, it\'s short and to the point.

*******************************************************************************
				Notes
*******************************************************************************

1) Well I\'m now only going to have 2 parts to the postings, a notes section
  and a move section, it\'s easier I think.

2) No one has mentioned what they wanted to do about the summer, except Mike, 
  please tell me, so I can figure out something.

3) Kurt missed this turn, so I made up his move.

*******************************************************************************
				Move
*******************************************************************************

	You all meet in the common room, the captain is looking a bit tired, and
suggests that everyone break for dinner.  You all then realize what time it is,
and comply.  Dan and Charlie come out for dinner too, and everyone discusses 
what you have all learned.
	"Yurl Hagard, hmmm, it\'s been a while since I\'ve heard that name," says
the captain.
	"Do you think it\'s true?" asks Erekosse.
	"With all that\'s happen, I doubt it, whoever these chumps are, they\'ve
aparently done their homework.  Yurl Hagard murdered my boss, Jan Morrison
the original owner of the Ulysses.  Yurl killed his wife, and we heard that he
was on Regina.  Jan was told that he could find a guy who knew where to find
Yurl in the Merc Hangout," says the captain.
	"Merc Hangout huh," says Erc,"tough place."
	"You bet," says Steve.
	"Never had the pleasure," responds Samantha.
	"Well anyway, Jan gets shot by a cop for carrying an illegal firearm,
and the ship was turned over to me.  It was in the news, so they could be just 
messing with our minds.  I thinks it\'s time to blow this thing so out of
control, we find out the real truth, eh," says the captain.
	"What do you plan to do," asks Dan.
	"It\'s more like we," says the captain, as he motions to all the people
at the table.  "First off, I\'m going to tell Hubert, Moe, and Curly that I\'m 
opening the crate.  Second, Erc and Steve will stay up here to guard them.  
Dan, Charlie and Samantha will try and get that crate open, with Erekosse 
watching them from a distance, just in case anything dangerous is in that crate.
And I will be both upstairs and down, just to watch and check up on you guys."
	"Sounds good to me," says Erekosse.
	"Great, when do we start?" asks Steve.
	"Tomorrow morning, after we tell them tonight.  I figure we let them 
think about it, and before our experts get to work, give them one last chance."
	"We\'ll get our stuff ready," says Charlie, and he and Dan leave the
table after putting their plates away.  The rest of you finish your meals and
the captain asks both Erc and Steve to come with him.  They enter Moe and 
Curly\'s stateroom, and leave a few minutes later, Moe and Curly can both be 
heard cussing.  They enter Huberts room and are out in the same amout of time.
	Steve says to the captain, "He was quite calm about that wasn\'t he?"
	"Yeah, too calm," says Erc.
	"Well then, we\'ll just open it and see," says the captain, a smile is 
forming on his lips.
	Dan and Charlie stay up late that night, with the captains permission, 
and assemble as much knowledge as they can on the type of lock that is on the
crate.  
	
	Samantha is the first one up, and she finds both Dan and Charlie asleep
on the G-cushions.  She makes some coffee, and offers it to them.  They both 
wake up grudgingly, accept the coffee, and say thanks.  They then excuse 
themselves and go take showers in their stateroom.
	The rest of you come out and find the captain and Erekosse and Samantha
eating breakfast.  The captain says to you all, "We\'re not going to ask them
again, I just want that crate open.  When Dan and Charlie finish eating, we\'re
doing it."
	Dan and Charlie come out, they are dressed in \'work\' clothes.  They eat
and after they are done, gather their tools and follow Erekosse and Samantha
downstairs.  They get to the crate and ask Samantha if she could just pass them
tools.  She says, no problem and sets up things behind them.  They work at a 
slow pace, taking time, dismantling the pad, they point out to each other where
Erc had tampered with the pad, and if anything was broken.  They work for about
4 hours and stop.  Lunch is brought down by the captain, and everyone eats.
	The guys upstairs are having no problems whatsoever.  They eat lunch and
are fully alert to everything.  The captain is looking slightly nervous, as he
eats his lunch, he says it\'s nothing, but it\'s apparent to Steve and Erc that
something is bugging him.

	After lunch is done, Dan and Charlie say that they are almost ready to 
open the crate, they ask if Samantha could spare he hands, because they need
the extra set.  She complies, and they have her hold a set of wires, that they
have attached to the door of the crate, they say it will only open three-fourths
of the way and she should hold the wires to the door at all times.  They tell
Erekosse that they are ready to open the door, and he radios the captain.  They
count to three and the door slowly opens.  Samantha follows the door as it opens
and when it stops she notices the sound of breathing coming from inside the 
crate.  She pears inside, curiousity getting the best of her, and she sees a 
smiling face and hears a car backfire.
	Erekosse is startled for a second as he hears a gunshot and sees 
Samantha fly back and hit a crate.  Dan and Charlie hit the floor ....

	Upstairs the gunshot is heard and everyone is distracted for a split
second, just as they all turn back, they see Hubert\'s door opening and Moe and
Curly\'s too.  A desk comes out of Curly\'s room with Moe right behind, Hubert 
hits the floor, they all have guns.  Steve flips the dinner table over and 
manuevers a chair to help give cover.  Erc dives behind the table, and Captain
Moray gets behind a wall.  The firefight has begun ....

I dont really care for MegaTraveller that much, although I like the task 
system to handle things that aren\'t in the rules I tend to use the 8+ die
roll modified by whatever it needs to modify it. I digress, sorry, back to
the original question, I dont really know if all the detail in MegaTraveller
is going to make me a better GM. All of a sudden just getting to jump point
takes 15 min. of game time. And how do you handle blown rolls?

My problem with the starship construction rules is that I was a Music
major in college, no a Science major. It takes a lot more math than I ever
want to get involved with voluntarily, to design a ship, and the erratta
doesn\'t exactly make life easier. I still get more of a charge of blowing
them up than in building them. 

	
>As a result of all this, I think that I will henceforth playtest the

I personally find old Traveller easier to GM for my style of play. But I 
do admit to not being a real detail oriented GM. I also, think I am to
nice to my players, I have trouble giving them trouble. Although they are in
for a surprise once they get back to their ship. :-D

Anyway I must apologize, seem to have veered far of course on this one, 
but how do you handle a bunch of adventurers that are about to enter a life 
of crime, and start pirating starships. Do you let them get themselves killed,
or do you let it lead where it may and the Devil be damned?

  Call this letter a kind of mixed bag...

  1.  You folks working on system generation:I love it.  I have no real
contributions to add since James\' programs do more than the ones I wrote for
my own use ever did.  I look forward to whatever you folks come up with.

  2.  I approve of the trade journal.  The only comment I have is related to
tech level.  There needs to be some alterations in how tech level works for
equipment availability and such.  See the rest of the post for general ideas.

  3.  Ship contruction is fatally flawed from a physics point of view.  I
realize that this is a role playing game, and so will not be perfect, but there
are some real bugs...

  First off, antimatter power plants should produce about a million times the
power that they do for a given amount of fuel.  I think fusion plants are off
by about five orders of magnitude.  I am not sure about the others.  I am
debating making the antimatter change, but I really do not want to start
mucking with the fusion rules.

  Second, nobody in thier right mind would want to put a disitegrator on a
small ship.

  Third, why on earth don\'t jump units get smaller or cheaper with tech level
rise?  Likewise for thrusters.  I somehow fail to believe that the technology
is perfect at TL 12.

  4.  Equipment rules are flawed in many of the same ways.  The econmic system
makes next to no sense.  Given that he wanted to create trade between various
tech levels, an unlikely proposition at best, he should have dealt with tech
level changes better.  I therefore propose the following ground rules for
technology.

- ----

  The typical credit referred to is the official currency of the Imperium,
backed by the TAS and the banking megacorporations.  This allows it to be a
good stable currency.  To convert to local currency, use the tables in Striker
or TCS.  I can type these in if needed.  Local currency _ONLY_ matters if one
wants to figure out how the standard of living relates to the standard of
living among the interstellar culture.  All transactions are usually carried
out in Imperial credits.

  Equipment will get cheaper by approx. 10% per tech level.  Thus, making a
TL 5 car at TL 9 should cost you .9^4 or 63% or the TL 9 cost.  Note that this
makes TL 12 merchant ships dirt cheap by TL 15.  Why are the space lanes not
full of these critters?  Because the TL 15 starport is swamped with offers to
build TL 15 craft at full price.

  Now, as TL rises, the functionality will increase by about 10-20% per tech
level.  In some cases, such as space technology or computers, the rise is much,
much more.  For these, I use about an order of magnitude for each 1-3 tech
levels depending on the effects I want to get out of the equipment.

  Finally, these two effects will compete, requiring me to replace the single
prices with a tech level matrix that give functionality and price at any given
tech level.

  Ilustrative example: The pocket computer.  It becomes available at TL 11

      TL
      |
Type--+--    1     1/bis     2     2/bis     3
      |
      11    1000
      12     900    1000
      13     810     900    1000
      14     720     810     900    1000
      15     630     720     810     900    1000


  Where type is the type of computer that it will duplicate.

  By the way, for ship computers, I allow a volume drop of about a factor of 2
or 3 per tech level.  Thus, at TL 15, one may have a big, expensive, power
hungry model 9, or a small, inexpensive model three that the ships engineer can
carry on his belt.

  As I said above, TL 15 starports are FAR to busy making mailitary and large
craft to make many free traders, thus the average free trader is about TL 12 or
so.  One can still run a free trader off a 1/bis, but it is not as tempting.


  Any comments, especially on fixes to the starship system in MT?

Scott Sellsworth (sellswor@jarthur.claremont.edu) raises some good point
in his article, but I think some are inaccurate.  I aim to provide counter-
examples on our planet.

First, he suggests that high tech levels wouldn\'t want to trade with low
tech levels.  This is simply not true.  The USA is probably two TL\'s higher
than several African nations which we are more than happy to trade with.
Low TL worlds provide: 1) cheap raw materials, and 2) cheap labor.  When 
a country gets a higher standard of living, the comparable cost one has
to pay people to work goes up.  Labor is dirt cheap in, say, Zaire but
expensive in the US.  It\'s even more expensive where the standard of living
is higher, like Beverly Hills.  A TL 15 fast food restaraunt with *live*
workers in it (rather than automation) would be incredibly expensive to
operate.

Also, he asks why don\'t TL 15 starports put out TL 12 ships which should
be a heckuva lot cheaper.  I don\'t know a good answer to this, but in the
"real world" I could ask why doesn\'t McDonnel/Douglass still make the 
DC 3?  I wold say for the same reason that merchant lines buy TL 15 rather
than TL 12 ships.  What the system doesn\'t explicitly say (but probably
should) is that if one has the money, the higher tech ship will almost
always provide a return on investment.  Part of this should be due to
the fact that as TL goes up, Jump Drive space and maybe fuel requirement
should go down.  Scott brings this up in his letter; a good point.

When dealing with complicated socio/economic questions I find the most
productive thing to do is to compare the Traveller situation with a similar
situation (if one exists) on Earth.  Last year\'s technology is usually
plentiful and cheap.  Earlier technology is usually not available.  Lower
tech worlds *will* have high tech equipment if they trade with High tech
worlds, but they can\'t produce it themselves.  People in "3rd world" 
countries can still have Corvette\'s, but the country doesn\'t have the
TL to produce them (or maintain them.)  

Hope this helps some people.  Let\'s keep up the good discussion on 
economics in the Trav/MT universe.

I have to disagree. I tend to view the Traveller/MT universe as a star-faring
version of the 18th-19th century sailing era. During that time, merchants were
often as heavily armed as warships, although usually a bit bigger than warships
of similar armament due to their cargo holds. Pirate corsairs were simply
warships or merchant ships under new management. I always had a great
disrespect for the 400t Corsair, available to Pirates under the old "Citizens
of the Imperium" book. A distinctive corsair like that would be attacked at
once by any Navy ships in the area. Better to have a free trader with some
decent weapons, and perhaps an upgraded computer. The Vargr corsair is exempt
from the above as, unlike in the Imperium, corsairing is an acceptable way of
life for Vargr. Of course, such a ship entering Imperial space does so at its
own risk!

I thought that\'s what they\'ve done. They\'ve also added a set of miniature
movement rules, replacing the High Guard long/short range, which is a good
idea except that it\'s unrealistic. The best movement system I ever saw was
the "Mayday" game, which had markers for present, past and projected positions
for each ship and missile. This simulated the motion of spacecraft much better.
Try flying backwards or sideways in MegaTraveller! Of course, if you\'re using
a lot of ships, the simple High Guard system cuts out a lot of work.

My thoughts and actions exactly!

Let it lead where it may. As GM, you\'re not responsible for your players\'
actions. You\'re responsible for what happens to them afterwards. A few hints
for prospective pirates follow.

"There are old pirates, there are bold pirates, but there are no old, bold
pirates." If they\'re careful, they may do well. If not, there is a Navy, one
of whose functions is to get them. Having said that, if they become
swashbucklers, give them a chance to be heroic.

They should not get greedy. Take one or two ships in a system, then go to
another system entirely. If piracy doesn\'t upset trade too much, they won\'t
have to worry about much more than the occasional patrol cruiser on patrol.
If they start wiping out everything in one region, then the Navy will be after
them in force. How much is after them will depend on how much of a nuisance
they become.

What will they do with prisoners? Kill them all, and leave no evidence? Or
let them live, treat them well, and release them soon? If the former, then
somehow some evidence will get out, and then they\'ll be Public Enemy No. 1.
If the latter, then when they have a reputation, the next trader they attack
will be more likely to surrender if its crew knows they\'ll get out alive and
well. It also fits in better with the swashbuckling image. They may even
become Public Hero No. 1!

They should think about where they will use for a base. They\'ll need supplies;
and one day, they\'ll meet a trader who fights back and damages their ship.
They had better not have antagonised all the class A and B starports!

They should think about what to do about stolen cargo. You do not just sell it
as if it were regular cargo!

They may run into other pirates who resent them poaching. Or pirates who have
accepted the offer below.

If they do really well, the Navy may ask them to go straight and help them hunt
down other pirates, in return for an amnesty. This actually happened in the age
of sail, to Sir Henry Morgan.

To summarise: if you think about it, and if the players aren\'t just getting
homicidal, a pirate campaign can be fun and challenging.

I don\'t know about MegaTraveller, but the old Traveller universe _was_ full of
ships of TL 12, or lower. The Type S scout/courier and the Type A free trader,
the most common ships around, could be built and maintained at TL 9! Which
meant that you could buy one just about anywhere, and you could get spares for
it just about anywhere. The problem with TL 15 starports is, there aren\'t many.
What do you do if your TL 15 ship breaks down while you\'re at Regina (class A
starport, TL 10)? The TL 15 starport builds ships for megacorporations who
probably have their own private spares stores, and for the Navy who does have
private spares stores all over the place - naval bases.
 
>   Ilustrative example: The pocket computer.  It becomes available at TL 11

Does that mean that Earth is now TL 11? Because I own a pocket computer. It
has 32K memory, although that can be expanded. Seriously, although I wouldn\'t
class it as a model 1 (which I\'m assuming is the equivalent of, say, a PDP-11)
I\'d expect a pocket model 1 at around TL 8 or 9.

Better yet, both. That way, if the ship\'s computer gets destroyed in battle,
you can use the belt computer to calculate your jumps to somewhere where you
can buy a new full size computer.

Does anyone know if GDW/Digest Group/Seeker/Etc. have any plans to release ship
diagrams for the TJ-type transport described in the Rebellion Sourcebook?  From
the art that is included, it appears that *someone* has at least an idea as to
size, etc.

If not, has anyone given any thought to working on it?  I\'m planning on running
my players through the "Nail Mission" senario that is included in the book.
(Once they get back from their recent 19-parsec misjump, that is!  ;-) )

I\'ve never done a ship plan, but I was impressed with the 200-ton trader
included with the Starship Operator\'s Guide, and would like to have something
like that for the TJ before I use it in play.

Any ideas?

 Thanks to the person who replied to my last post;  I would be more specific,
but my mailer ate the message.  I agree with what you said.  I would generalize
it as "on high tech worlds, manufacturing has many more capabilities, but these
add complexity and demnad, therefore costs to use."

  Last time, I wrote about a few theories I had on why I thought the traveller
technology setup is a bit messed up.  I also proposed a fix for the strange
lack of change in the available equipment at any given tech level.  I would
like to expand on that in terms of a generic credit rating system.

  Mega Traveller claims that a person spends 250cr/month per level of social
standing, regardless of where they are from.  I do not agree with this due to
the obvious holes in it.  F;oirst off, this means that a Duke spends only about
15 times what a social standing of 1 does.  Second, a duke from Regina would
seem to have a richer lifestyle than one from elsewhere.  I have started to fix
this in the following way.

  First off, define a base per capita GNP.  Striker claims that 2000 cr per TL
above 4 is good, thus a TL 15 person has a base GNP of 22000 cr.  I personally
woulkd modify this like so:

  TL | base GNP
  0     100
  1     250
  2     500
  3    1000
  4    2000
  5    3000
  6    4000
  7    6000
 ...
 15   22000

  This is then modified the trade classes of the world, ranging from 0.8 for
non-agricultural and non-industrial worlds to about 1.4 or 1.5 for a rich
world.  This seems reasonable to me, in that the per capita GNP of world with a
tech level below 4 is almost nonexistent compared to that produced at higher
tech levels.  Also, the amount of cash flowing through someone\'s hands when
they are on a rich world will be much higher than otherwise, while a poor world
will tend to have less credit flowing through any one person\'s hands.

  Now, this requires a calculation of how much each social class spends.  Here
I could use some help.  The other night, I figured out that the average person
gains +0.5 social standing through a typical run through the services.  Because
the Navy will tend to boost social standing by a significant amount, while the
pirates will attenuate it, I assumed the following distributions.

    After typical service, 24% of the population has SS drop by 1
                           35% does not change
                           35% raises by 1
                           10% raises by 2
                            1% raises by 3

  These are rough numbers; I intend to run a quick simulation to get a more
rtealistic distribution.  Anyone with the mustering out tables programmed into
a computer could do me a BIG favor by running a bunch of samples and mailing me
the results.

  One then applies this to the normal distribution of stats to get a *real*
spectrum of social standings.  From the reading I have done of the dugest group
stuff, there should be a bias towards the low level nobility due to the
Imperial requirement that all civil servants be part of the peerage.

  Now, once this is done, I will make an income distribution.  I am thinking
of having the lowest social classes live on about a third of the per capita
GNP, while the very highest live on about twenty or thirty times that.  I have
arbitrarily decided that the per capita GNP should be earned by social
standings of around 10, mostly because those above them are so profligate in
thier spending that they bias the curve upwards.  Suggestions?

  Finally, I am hoping to set some sort of "propensity to consume."  I am not
sure if this should be related to government type, or just a DM set thing.  I
am thinking of a range of 60-100% of production is immediately burned in the
society.  This suddenly becomes of interest to a character, as I will expect
them to keep this standard up when they are hired by a shipping company as
crew.  I postulate that there is an incredible desire on the part of most
people to get into space, but a great lack of qualified people who can actually
get those jobs, thus the salaries for space workers are generally much, much
higher than those for a ground worker.

  Thus, social standing will affect a characters income and spending habits
over a range of two orders of magnitude, also depending on what planet they
come from and the conditions they grew up under.  These then may be modified
as needed to produce a real variety of standards of living, as well as a quick
comparison between an adventurer\'s wealth and the typical planet denezin.

  Anyone see any serious flaws?  Anything that might make this a bit easier to
compute?

  With any luck, I should be able to get this done by semester\'s end.  Those
pesky finals may get in the way...

Computer questions!  First off, what does \'bis\' mean?  I remember that \'fib\'
meant something like \'fiber backup\', but \'bis\' escapes me.  "Big Information
System"?

Also, what actual effect does differing computer models have on ship\'s
functions, aside from the DM\'s to the various tasks?  For example, the 200-ton
trader detailed in the Starship Operator\'s Guide:  Is it doing all of this crew
recognition, entertainment holograms, etc. on a model 1 computer?  If it is
powerful enough to do all this, is there any reason to have a better (more $)
model?  And if it\'s not, why waste processing on \'frills\' at the expense of the
DM\'s for combat, etc.?

Am I confused?  I think so.  (That would be standard.)

if anybody out there has a system, on trade and commerce, even a half-started 
one, let\'s see it and let us comment on it. I will be brave and get the really

about a week. So if there is a brave soul that isn\'t afraid of some 
constructive criticism, send me your system and let us take a look at what 
you got.

As a player and a referee, I don\'t like to roll dice.  I like to play very
"fast and loose" games where the object is not who can roll the best dice,
but who can role play the most interesting characters.  I see the various
tables as a starting place for an adventure, not the adventure.  

Too much line noise at this end.  So I\'m going to jack-out now.

Hi Matt, this is Greg from the Trade and Commerce Digest, I was wandering if
you were planning to expound some more on your starting statement. If you could 
I think that it would make some interesting points and lead to some good 
discussions. I would like to see some more of your thoughts, if you have the 
time. I promise that I won\'t use to much red ink on them. Basically the point
of your letter is something that I have felt strongly about, for some time.
I have seen gaming sessions grind to a halt because the ship owners needed to 
find out what cargo was available. This meant that the rest of the players 
sat around and got board. I realize now that I should have cargos pregenerated,
but I never think of that until it is too late. Also then even if I have 
pregenerated cargos, then the spend time deciding what cargos they want to buy.
Let me know what you think on the subject, also what might be done to 
aleviate this problem. 

Thanks for your time,

Greg

Subject: Re: Trade & Commerce system

Hello!  It\'s late at night and the lines to work are quiet now.

     I believe that the *most* important aspect of a game is having fun.  I
do not like spend evenings rolling dice and consulting charts.   I do not
like to run groups of people who like to have everything determined by "The
Great Charts."  Life is more random than that.

     Charts and tables are a good starting place for a DM (or whatever the
"official" term is :-) )  When I plan an adventure I only sketch out rough
plot suggestions.  Players almost never do exactly what I want.  I have a
very heavily populated universe.  Most of my NPC\'s are player characters of
former adventurers, ex-PC have backgrounds and desires all of their own.  I
try to set a mood for the players that they are involved in a real
universe, populated by real people.  Sure there is the bellhop or checkout
lane person who is lucky to have a name, but there is a lot of dressing.

     Most of the people don\'t want to do boring things.  Player\'s for the
most part are not interested in carrying "FARMING IMPLEMENTS, 25 TONS."
However, when one of the "FARMING IMPLEMENTS" has a 5 kiloton/second rate
of fire, things can get interesting.  Rolling the dice can make very rich
characters while role playing can result in characters who are both rich
and interesting.

     My favorate \'setup\' to run has been dubbed _Hotel_of_Death_ by the
players.  The senario\'s initial conditions are the same each time; however,
no two games have ended remotly alike.  A couple of groups never even made
it to the hotel.  They got wrapped up in local politics.  Eventually I hope
to get the senario typed into my system at home.  Currently it lives on
about 200 pages of handwritten notes. (The names "Hotel of Death", "Hotel of
Death II", and "Hotel of Death III" are copyright Matt Goldman.)

     Sigh, this is getting long and off track.  I like games where the
adventure happens to the players.  I dislike games where there is only one
correct solution.

Later.

Subject: A few foulups

[Stuff Deleted - Greg]

  2.  I approve of the trade journal.  The only comment I have is related to
tech level.  There needs to be some alterations in how tech level works for
equipment availability and such.  See the rest of the post for general ideas.

  4.  Equipment rules are flawed in many of the same ways.  The econmic system
makes next to no sense.  Given that he wanted to create trade between various
tech levels, an unlikely proposition at best, he should have dealt with tech
level changes better.  I therefore propose the following ground rules for
technology.

- ----

  The typical credit referred to is the official currency of the Imperium,
backed by the TAS and the banking megacorporations.  This allows it to be a
good stable currency.  To convert to local currency, use the tables in Striker
or TCS.  I can type these in if needed.  Local currency _ONLY_ matters if one
wants to figure out how the standard of living relates to the standard of
living among the interstellar culture.  All transactions are usually carried
out in Imperial credits.

  Equipment will get cheaper by approx. 10% per tech level.  Thus, making a
TL 5 car at TL 9 should cost you .9^4 or 63% or the TL 9 cost.  Note that this
makes TL 12 merchant ships dirt cheap by TL 15.  Why are the space lanes not
full of these critters?  Because the TL 15 starport is swamped with offers to
build TL 15 craft at full price.

  Now, as TL rises, the functionality will increase by about 10-20% per tech
level.  In some cases, such as space technology or computers, the rise is much,
much more.  For these, I use about an order of magnitude for each 1-3 tech
levels depending on the effects I want to get out of the equipment.

  Finally, these two effects will compete, requiring me to replace the single
prices with a tech level matrix that give functionality and price at any given
tech level.

  Ilustrative example: The pocket computer.  It becomes available at TL 11

      TL
      |
Type--+--    1     1/bis     2     2/bis     3
      |
      11    1000
      12     900    1000
      13     810     900    1000
      14     720     810     900    1000
      15     630     720     810     900    1000


  Where type is the type of computer that it will duplicate.

  By the way, for ship computers, I allow a volume drop of about a factor of 2
or 3 per tech level.  Thus, at TL 15, one may have a big, expensive, power
hungry model 9, or a small, inexpensive model three that the ships engineer can
carry on his belt.

  As I said above, TL 15 starports are FAR to busy making mailitary and large
craft to make many free traders, thus the average free trader is about TL 12 or
so.  One can still run a free trader off a 1/bis, but it is not as tempting.

===================================================

4. From: "Nick Christenson @ St. Olaf College" <christnp@thor.acc.stolaf.edu>
Subject: Economics in the Trav/MT universe

Scott Sellsworth (sellswor@jarthur.claremont.edu) raises some good point
in his article, but I think some are inaccurate.  I aim to provide counter-
examples on our planet.

First, he suggests that high tech levels wouldn\'t want to trade with low
tech levels.  This is simply not true.  The USA is probably two TL\'s higher
than several African nations which we are more than happy to trade with.
Low TL worlds provide: 1) cheap raw materials, and 2) cheap labor.  When 
a country gets a higher standard of living, the comparable cost one has
to pay people to work goes up.  Labor is dirt cheap in, say, Zaire but
expensive in the US.  It\'s even more expensive where the standard of living
is higher, like Beverly Hills.  A TL 15 fast food restaraunt with *live*
workers in it (rather than automation) would be incredibly expensive to
operate.

Also, he asks why don\'t TL 15 starports put out TL 12 ships which should
be a heckuva lot cheaper.  I don\'t know a good answer to this, but in the
"real world" I could ask why doesn\'t McDonnel/Douglass still make the 
DC 3?  I wold say for the same reason that merchant lines buy TL 15 rather
than TL 12 ships.  What the system doesn\'t explicitly say (but probably
should) is that if one has the money, the higher tech ship will almost
always provide a return on investment.  Part of this should be due to
the fact that as TL goes up, Jump Drive space and maybe fuel requirement
should go down.  Scott brings this up in his letter; a good point.

When dealing with complicated socio/economic questions I find the most
productive thing to do is to compare the Traveller situation with a similar
situation (if one exists) on Earth.  Last year\'s technology is usually
plentiful and cheap.  Earlier technology is usually not available.  Lower
tech worlds *will* have high tech equipment if they trade with High tech
worlds, but they can\'t produce it themselves.  People in "3rd world" 
countries can still have Corvette\'s, but the country doesn\'t have the
TL to produce them (or maintain them.)  

Hope this helps some people.  Let\'s keep up the good discussion on 
economics in the Trav/MT universe.

I just want to say thanks, I think that I may have become stuffy in my old

of ways to kill each other. But if they become pirates then advancement thru
murder is quite a "ends justifies the means" way of handling it. At least in

  As best as I can tell, it means "better."  In Old Traveller, the bis models
were identical to the normal ones, except that they had a mauch larger cpu and
no storage.  Thus, one could run better programs, but one had fewer options (in
general)  This was an artifact of the old traveller system where one had
specific programs that did things and took up generic space units.  I
personally liek the new system better where a bigger computer just controls
more stuff.

- ---- End quoted stuff

  Hokay, here is what **WE** do. This is not very official....

  First off, a bigger computer lets you get by with less crew, or lets you use
better equipment with the same crew.  Second, the machinery gives you neat
combat DM\'s  We rule that most of that dreck they mention in the starship
operators manual can be run on most machines, but it gets better with tech
level and computer power.  When a combat situation comes up, you sht down your
library program and all the entertainment consoles, shoo the passengers back to
thier rooms, and lock all of the doors.  Thus, a combat is the ideal time to
try and take a ship over as its internal scanners may well be inoperative.
This is not so on a ship with *far* more computing power than it needs.

  Example:My current group was given an electronic warfare/tacint ship vaguely
disguised as a merchant ship.  They have three of every communicator ever built
at experimental tech levels.  (Read as "prone to failure at bad times")  Thier
electronics are fantastic, and thier computer would normally be a part of a
battleship.  A big battleship.  This little toy was built by Naval Intelligence
as a small spy craft.  Because it is so overpowered, it routinely keeps track
of all sorts of things that a normal ships computer would not.  (e.g recording
all intrument readings at all times, instead of the critical ones, recording
comm channels and sensor inputs much of the time on the off chance it will be
useful later, etc.)

  Now, I allow technology to fight it out on many occasions.  Breaking the
security on a coded transmission is child\'s play to a device like this, so it
is routinely done.  They usually have no problem crashing security on most
planets they go to, etc.  On the downside, it can be spotted.  After all, thier
software is only as good as the programmer.  While the hardware is almost
unbeatable, a clever person on a ground station might well notice the breakin
attempts and get them into heaps and piles of trouble, when they really were
not interested in the information.

  It is an equivalent circumstance to a band of space aliens coming to earth
and casually breaking into the NSA or CIA files just to see if they can do it.
This is would cause a great deal of trouble.

  By the way, to the person who mentioned you "pocket computer," I believe that
the model 1 is at or near mainframe levels of capability, pushing into the
supercomputer regions.  I do think it should be earlier than TL 11, but my
gripes about the weird, utterly non-linear technology scale are well known.

Computer questions!  First off, what does \'bis\' mean?  I remember that \'fib\'
meant something like \'fiber backup\', but \'bis\' escapes me.  "Big Information
System"?

Also, what actual effect does differing computer models have on ship\'s
functions, aside from the DM\'s to the various tasks?  For example, the 200-ton
trader detailed in the Starship Operator\'s Guide:  Is it doing all of this crew
recognition, entertainment holograms, etc. on a model 1 computer?  If it is
powerful enough to do all this, is there any reason to have a better (more $)
model?  And if it\'s not, why waste processing on \'frills\' at the expense of the
DM\'s for combat, etc.?

My reply:

The big difference in computer types is how *good* a program you can run
(as well as how many you can run at once.)

The programs for navigation and maneuvering in system seem to be fairly
standardized and comparatively brief.  However, the combat programs come
in all ranges of sophistication.  This is evident in the High Guard combat
system, as well as it\'s direct descendent MegaTraveller.

At first one might think that computers don\'t do enough.  I think that 
since relative computer size is the *only* modifier that effects *every*
to hit and to penetrate die roll.  One can also imagine a large number
of things the computer has to monitor as well.  Think about how much junk
the Space Shuttle\'s computer system keeps track of!  And that\'s just for
an in-system ship that can\'t keep a timetable!  For a free trader to be
profitable it has to be reliable which means on board diagnostic and 
automated correction systems have to be excellent, taking up lots of 
CPU time.  This is my interperetation as to why a ship of a given size
has a minimum computer requirement.  

Obviously the people at GDW have simplified things considerably and 
more or less reasonably.

I think Book 2 says what BIS stands for but I don\'t have it handy.  Volume
one of High Guard (anyone besides me remember this?) says a bis computer
is "enhanced."  That\'s all I could come up with.

Enjoy,

Most importantly, there were a whole range of "Jump" programs, one for each
length of jump. The longer the jump, the larger the program. In addition to
the "Jump" program, you also had to run a "Navigate" program. A model 1
computer could run "Navigate" and "Jump-1" together, but not "Navigate" and
"Jump-2", which a scout/courier or far trader would need to do. A model 2
could do that, but cost MCr9, to the Model 1\'s MCr1, and in addition was
larger (2 tons vs. 1 ton). The model 1 bis could run "Navigate" and "Jump-2"
together, but only cost MCr4 and only took up 1 ton.

The model 1 has 2 units CPU, and 4 units store. It could run anti-hijack (1
unit) permanently, and alternate between, say, Manoeuvre, Library, Target,
and a couple of others, each requiring 1 unit.

>  If it is powerful enough to do all this, is there any reason to have

Yes. A model 1 can\'t do a jump-2. It also can\'t run many programs at once, and
can\'t run some of the nicer ones at all, e.g. "Double Fire" (4 units).

> ...	 Thus, a combat is the ideal time to

Under the old rules, just before jumping it the ideal time for this, for the
same reason. The computer is running "Navigate" and "Jump-1", each 1 unit.
If it\'s a model 1, that\'s all it\'s doing.

That was me, and I know that. That\'s why I didn\'t ask for pocket computers to be
available at TL 7 or 8.

Now for my next gripe. "Fib" means "fibre-optic back-up", and is supposed to
protect the computer against radiation damage. Firstly, a half-decent EMP would
fry the chips, regardless of whether or not fibre-optics were being used.
Secondly, nowadays fibre-optics are starting to be used in the main circuits,
never mind back-ups, and for speed reasons as well as protection. So here\'s
what I do. A computer designated "fib" has a backup alright, consisting of
redundant components. If the computer gets damaged, by radiation or anything
else, the damage may be either to the main computer or to its back-up. So there
are effectively two computers, which I refer to as A and B. When computer
damage occurs, I roll 1D; on a roll of 1-3, A gets it; on a roll of 4-6, B gets
it. Whichever is the least damaged is the one which is used. In fact, there are
not two distinct machines; the least damaged set of components is being used.
But it\'s a quick\'n\'dirty system which allows simulation of back-up.

Probably death by whoever finds them first. As well as the Navy, there may also
be bounty-hunters. If they do surrender and get handed over to the authorities,
as opposed to getting "shot trying to escape", their sentence will probably
depend on how much damage they\'ve done, and what they did to their prisoners.
Possibly death, possibly long-term imprisonment. Do you have the published
adventures "Kinunir" or "Prison Planet"?

I believe \'bis\' stands for \'binary inline store\' or something along
those lines.  As Adrian Hurt mentioned, it has 2 CPUs and extra memory 
storage.  Personally, I have always found the Traveller computer rules
to have very little to do with modern computer science.  They seemed
more like computers of 15-20 years ago, when you had to exchange
disk packs to run a different program.  With current trends in optical
storage, fiber optics, multi-processing, micro-miniaturization (yes,
even Crays are getting tiny), etc., computers used to operate starships
would be much different than those portrayed in Traveller.

Do others have these same feelings?

Brett Slocum commented that Traveller\'s ship\'s computers seem highly

computers that are *less* bulky, power-hungry, and costly.  The Traveller
rules are hopelessly silly.

When I design ships for the universe I GM, I substitute the following
quick rule fix:  shipboard computers have an effective weight of zero
(justified by assuming the tonnage allocated to the bridge is more than
sufficient to accomodate a CPU).  Cost of computers drops 20% for each 
TL above the minimum needed to construct a particular model, down to
20% of original cost (i.e., 4 TL\'s above minimum), and 5% per TL
thereafter.  Computers do not explicitly require EP.

How does this rule fix change the game?  Not much.  It does allow a
small ship to have a whopping CPU ---- but the high cost should be
adequate discouragement.

(Good question:  why do it, if it has little impact on the game?
 Answer:  it makes me feel better.)

The Traveller treatment of computers is useless, in my opinion.
I see three options:

    1. Treat computers as so effective, pervasive, and necessary that they
    are ignored for game purposes.  Computer skill is a la Neuromancer,
    requiring equipment, time, and colossally expensive and restricted
    software that comes in a tiny memory pack.  If a ship\'s computer goes
    out, the ship is totally helpless in combat (since the other ship will
    evade all attacks and bypass all defenses).

    2. Treat computers as the beasts of space opera.  Huge vacuum-tube
    affairs that take up lots of space and are incredibly ineffective.
    Traveller rules as written will do fine for this option.

    3. Work within a Dune-like campaign background, where devices to
    perform computations are strictly forbidden upon pain of atomic death,
    and all calculation is done by highly trained individuals.  Computer
    skill vanishes entirely, but characters may choose to be Mentats:
    No promotion, survive 6+, skills as Other plus Mentat-1 each term.

BIS, I think, stands for something like "improved" or some
such thing. For example, there is a version of the old Mig-15
known as the BIS. Since this is an early 50\'s aircraft, I doubt
that Binary In Store is what the designation stands for.

Also, you are right about the computers having little
to do with current technology. Digest Group, who for all practical
purposes is writing the Traveller rulebook these days, has found
away around this by saying that all systems are triplicated, and that
is why they are so large. Seen the Starship Operator\'s Manual
for more information.

The above suggestion sounds rather good, however the rules are
still a little poor in that the traveller computers still cannot do much.
For example the CPU times of human use programs (like library data
and anti-hijack ) shold me zero. The relative amount of time for the
computer to bring up a file for a person to read is minimal, and 
Anti Hijack only has to be called when someone want\'s to open 
a door. The door probably has all the hardware required to scan
all the computer has to do is fetch a file from "hard" storage
and compare it to the input. These computers are certainantly
large multi processor jobs so all the computer does is hold the 
door untill a processor is free and then speeds the verification
through.

Why do you need a supercomputer in your pocket?  Why isn\'t the pocket
computer just another "cell" of a larger computer that uses many cells
working in parallel in a cooperative network?  Why do Traveller computers
resemble 1970\'s mainframes running MVS?  By the way, I beleive that \'bis\'
is a signifier from IBM mainframes (from the \'70s) that means "enhanced".

If the chips were completely enclosed in a conductive, grounded shield, the
EMP could not reach them.  With fibre-optic cables entering the shield, the
chips inside would be relatively safe.

Exactly.  Any computer system found in the higher tech levels of Traveller
would probably not be made of silicon.  Making the entire computer out of
fibre-optic technology or something unknown right now is not that
far-fetched.  This is why computers in Traveller irk me so much.  Not much
imagination went into extrapolating current computer technology into the
future.

Awwww, you can\'t do that!  It would make it nearly impossible to hijack
a ship!  Consider this, as the hardware gets better, programmers constantly
push the machine to the edges of it\'s ability.  It is quite likely that
as happens now, the machine is operating on the verge of overload.  When
one is about to jump, one turns off programs extraneous to performing the
jump so that one has spare capacity.  Of course, you could defeat this
problem by buying a large computer, and \'smaller\' more efficient programs
to run on it.

How\'s that?

There was a WWII Italian fighter, the Fiat G50, which had a "bis" variant.
"Bis" was around long before computers.

As for pocket supercomputers, wait till someone puts a small LCD display and
keyboard onto a transputer board! 1MB in your pocket - you can keep your 1 ton
Model 1 bis!

Seriously though, if that sort of computing power becomes available and cheap,
big machines may become obsolete. Who needs a room full of computer when you
can do all your work on your lap-top, then send it via a modem by telephone,
radio, laser or meson communicator to whoever you want. To reverse the emphasis
above, "larger" computers may become nothing more than a lot of portable
machines networked together. Or, as I said in an earlier article, suppose
someone on the ship has a pocket model 1. The ship\'s main computer gets blown
away by a critical hit. So the pocket model gets linked to the ship\'s systems,
and the ship can at least jump again.

Are you sure? If so, why is EMP a problem? Most machines have earthed, metal
shells, mainly to prevent them from causing radio interference.

Back to the real world. My statement about pocket computers having 32K has
just gone out of date. There\'s a new one out with 64K. We\'re getting there!

That\'s what the fiber-optic cables are for -- most EMP is carried into
equipment by the wires, which act like antennas.  (BTW, a friend just asked
me about "fiber optic power cables".  A good question...)  For best
protective effect, the metal enclosure should also be spherical -- such a
structure is known as a "Faraday Cage", after EMP pioneer and discoverer of
the solenoid Michael Faraday.  Note that a Faraday Cage doesn\'t depend on
being "grounded" -- just on the fact that the electrostatic force is an
inverse-square law (in normal space-time, my friend comments.  Relativistic
speeds and jumpspace are an interesting question...)  (Another good question
- -- what does "ground" or "earth" mean in this context, anyway? -- It seems
to me that with the EMP-generating device and its target insulated nearly
perfectly from each other and the rest of the universe, the electromagnetics
get pretty complicated -- particularly since there are probably also a bunch
of charged particles flying around...)

Sigh.  Looks to me like it\'s time to pitch the "fiber-optic" explanation, and
just describe these computers as "hardened" (in the military sense).
Otherwise, the physics gets too hairy to be fun anymore.  Note as well that
one would expect that there are better ways than EMP to selectively attack
complicated computing machines this far in the future anyway...

Please don\'t flame me B-) (I was a music major in college, the closest thing
that I got to physics, was Acoustics of Music (Acoustical Physics only)) but
do we have to have a rationale for everything, or could you just say it is 
that way because the "rules" say so? I know I am naive, so flame away.

Bis is latin for doubled.  The use as improved came from places like
the MiG-15 as noted. (P.S. It shold be in the dictionary).

Computers:  Actually if you know nothing at all about computers the computer
rules work rather well.  (Since when Traveller was first published I knew
nothing about  computers, except that you could play games on them, I had no
troubles with the rules).  Still the rules aren\'t too bad considering that
they were written by someone who at the time knew virtually nothing about
computers. (At the time Traveller was first published the only computer
anyone at GDW had any experiance with was an old Tandy which was mainly used
to play an unwinable Dungeon game).  They do effectively limit what a ship
can do versus other ships, which is primarily their purpose.  At any rate,
for my house rules I modified the rules as follows:

	Assume the chart on p.13 book 2 is for TL 5.
	Combine the CPU/Storage columns into one for capacity
		Note: this eliminates Bis models.
	On even TL cut the cost by 1/3
	On odd TL shift the capacity down by one row i.e. the model two
		becomes model 1, etc.
		I projected the top of the chart at a capacity of 20.
	I never modified Software, but I had considered subtracting a
	constant from the capacity for the routine Data Bases and stuff.
	This would make ground based computers more effective.

Hello Travellers!

This is your list administrator, James Perkins (using a guest account).
With this message I am testing all-new list software.

I\'ve been working on a method to allow each of you to decide whether
you\'d like to receive this list in "instant" form (like it\'s done now),
or twice-a-week "digest" form.  After spending about 15 hours of time
working on it, I think it\'s ready for the first real test.

You are all currently registered for "instant" delivery, so you should
see little change in delivery.  When I am convinced the software is
operating correctly, I\'ll ask you all to tell me if you want to change
your delivery method to "digest", but for now, please keep quiet.  I
plan to test for a week or two.

[However, if you\'d like to become a beta-tester for digest delivery (and
hence at risk for poor delivery, and asked to report problems), feel
free to contact me at once].

Oh, if you receive this message and are feeling "in a particularly
helpful mood", feel free to send an acknowledgement.  Only do this if it
is convenient for you.  I don\'t want to be flooded with
acknowledgements.  It would help make me feel a little more comfortable
that the new software is operating correctly.

If you have been planning a posting to the list, please don\'t wait until
everything is tested to post it! I need your messages to test this
software.

I really hope this will work; people are still continuing to drop out of
the list because of the high volume; digesting must be implemented to
keep the listees happy and permit list growth.

Cross my fingers...

Well, after designing a ship, I reevaluated it to make sure I hadn\'t made
any mistakes and to try to eke out more space for cargo.  It was, after
all, a freighter.

I fiddled with it and finally came out with something useable.  But in
order to check my numbers I compared my ship to a standard model built with
the same hull.  Boy! was I in for a shock!

The ship I built had nowhere near the accommodations, nowhere near the
cargo space, nowhere near the price!  My crew was sleeping in bunks vs
staterooms, 2700 vs 1900 kl of cargo space, and my ship cost 3x as much,
about MCr 65 vs MCr 195.  What the ...!

I see no way for this particular ship, the Subsidized Merchant, to be
built with its purported data given the MegaTraveller shipbuilding rules.
Are we being tricked here, or what?  Has anyone else tried to check the
building of the standard ships with the MegaTraveller ruleset?

A somewhat radical solution to the Traveller computer problem is to treat
all reasonably high tech level computers as AIs (artificial intelligences)
and use them as NPC\'s.

This has a number of advantages:
1) It is a (perhaps the only) reasonable extrapolation of current computer
   science.
2) It often makes for a smoother and more natural interaction between the
   Referee and players.  The Ref can simply speak as the AI when giving
   players info from data bases or ship\'s instruments rather than describing
   what the players are seeing on a display in the usual narrative style.
3) Interactions with AIs often provide an additional "futuristic" element
   or even challenge in the game.  AIs should, of course, have interesting
   and somewhat quirky (by human standards) "personalities" in some
   plausable way (Think of HAL in 2001 but try to be original.)

There are some problems also, naturally:
1) If you are not careful the AIs will be so powerful as to overwhelm the
   players or leave them with nothing to do except issue orders to the AI.
   The best solution seems to be to handicap the machines in some ways; I
   used (when I was a Ref) Asimov\'s famous 3 laws plus the stipulation that
   AIs had to be shut down while preparing for, during, and following jump
   due to an unfortunate interaction between the jump field and the 
   unspecified hardware technology of AIs.  They can also be made relatively
   fragile during combat.  I found that these conditions left plenty of
   need for the usual player skills.
2) The "computer" skill must be modified in some way.  I usually let the
   player choose between hardware skill (ability to fix AIs, can be very
   important) and software skill (not programming which is all done by the
   AIs themselves but gives favorable DMs in dealing with AIs, sort of a
   machine equivalent of carisma).

Letter from the Editor.

This is just a small gripe. As you will see most of the contents of the Digest,
I "lifted" from the list. If this Digest is going to work, you have to send 
your stuff to ME, not the list. Otherwise all I end up doing is send out 
duplicate articles. So, an appeal, if you have something that you think falls
under the heading of Trade or Commerce, E-Mail me direct, if the mail bounces
let Jim know.

So much for the complaint, now for the good stuff, we have some really nice 
articles for your perusal this time, especially number three, "Thoughts on 
planetary GNP", by Scott Ellsworth, at least I thought it was interesting. 
Also, Mark Power has some thoughts for us to ponder, as you will see, his is
the only article included that came direct to me, not to the list. So please
folks, take the time to edit the header TO: line. Thanks, Greg

I have to disagree. I tend to view the Traveller/MT universe as a star-faring
version of the 18th-19th century sailing era. During that time, merchants were
often as heavily armed as warships, although usually a bit bigger than warships
of similar armament due to their cargo holds. Pirate corsairs were simply
warships or merchant ships under new management. I always had a great
disrespect for the 400t Corsair, available to Pirates under the old "Citizens
of the Imperium" book. A distinctive corsair like that would be attacked at
once by any Navy ships in the area. Better to have a free trader with some
decent weapons, and perhaps an upgraded computer. The Vargr corsair is exempt
from the above as, unlike in the Imperium, corsairing is an acceptable way of
life for Vargr. Of course, such a ship entering Imperial space does so at its
own risk!

I don\'t know about MegaTraveller, but the old Traveller universe _was_ full of
ships of TL 12, or lower. The Type S scout/courier and the Type A free trader,
the most common ships around, could be built and maintained at TL 9! Which
meant that you could buy one just about anywhere, and you could get spares for
it just about anywhere. The problem with TL 15 starports is, there aren\'t many.
What do you do if your TL 15 ship breaks down while you\'re at Regina (class A
starport, TL 10)? The TL 15 starport builds ships for megacorporations who
probably have their own private spares stores, and for the Navy who does have
private spares stores all over the place - naval bases.
 
>   Ilustrative example: The pocket computer.  It becomes available at TL 11

Does that mean that Earth is now TL 11? Because I own a pocket computer. It
has 32K memory, although that can be expanded. Seriously, although I wouldn\'t
class it as a model 1 (which I\'m assuming is the equivalent of, say, a PDP-11)
I\'d expect a pocket model 1 at around TL 8 or 9.

Better yet, both. That way, if the ship\'s computer gets destroyed in battle,
you can use the belt computer to calculate your jumps to somewhere where you
can buy a new full size computer.

3. From: HMCVAX.BITNET!SELLSWORTH@rutgers.edu
Subject: Thoughts on planetary GNP.
Archive-Message-Number: 335

 Thanks to the person who replied to my last post;  I would be more specific,
but my mailer ate the message.  I agree with what you said.  I would generalize
it as "on high tech worlds, manufacturing has many more capabilities, but these
add complexity and demnad, therefore costs to use."

  Last time, I wrote about a few theories I had on why I thought the traveller
technology setup is a bit messed up.  I also proposed a fix for the strange
lack of change in the available equipment at any given tech level.  I would
like to expand on that in terms of a generic credit rating system.

  Mega Traveller claims that a person spends 250cr/month per level of social
standing, regardless of where they are from.  I do not agree with this due to
the obvious holes in it.  F;oirst off, this means that a Duke spends only about
15 times what a social standing of 1 does.  Second, a duke from Regina would
seem to have a richer lifestyle than one from elsewhere.  I have started to fix
this in the following way.

  First off, define a base per capita GNP.  Striker claims that 2000 cr per TL
above 4 is good, thus a TL 15 person has a base GNP of 22000 cr.  I personally
woulkd modify this like so:

  TL | base GNP
  0     100
  1     250
  2     500
  3    1000
  4    2000
  5    3000
  6    4000
  7    6000
 ...
 15   22000

  This is then modified the trade classes of the world, ranging from 0.8 for
non-agricultural and non-industrial worlds to about 1.4 or 1.5 for a rich
world.  This seems reasonable to me, in that the per capita GNP of world with a
tech level below 4 is almost nonexistent compared to that produced at higher
tech levels.  Also, the amount of cash flowing through someone\'s hands when
they are on a rich world will be much higher than otherwise, while a poor world
will tend to have less credit flowing through any one person\'s hands.

  Now, this requires a calculation of how much each social class spends.  Here
I could use some help.  The other night, I figured out that the average person
gains +0.5 social standing through a typical run through the services.  Because
the Navy will tend to boost social standing by a significant amount, while the
pirates will attenuate it, I assumed the following distributions.

    After typical service, 24% of the population has SS drop by 1
                           35% does not change
                           35% raises by 1
                           10% raises by 2
                            1% raises by 3

  These are rough numbers; I intend to run a quick simulation to get a more
rtealistic distribution.  Anyone with the mustering out tables programmed into
a computer could do me a BIG favor by running a bunch of samples and mailing me
the results.

  One then applies this to the normal distribution of stats to get a *real*
spectrum of social standings.  From the reading I have done of the dugest group
stuff, there should be a bias towards the low level nobility due to the
Imperial requirement that all civil servants be part of the peerage.

  Now, once this is done, I will make an income distribution.  I am thinking
of having the lowest social classes live on about a third of the per capita
GNP, while the very highest live on about twenty or thirty times that.  I have
arbitrarily decided that the per capita GNP should be earned by social
standings of around 10, mostly because those above them are so profligate in
thier spending that they bias the curve upwards.  Suggestions?

  Finally, I am hoping to set some sort of "propensity to consume."  I am not
sure if this should be related to government type, or just a DM set thing.  I
am thinking of a range of 60-100% of production is immediately burned in the
society.  This suddenly becomes of interest to a character, as I will expect
them to keep this standard up when they are hired by a shipping company as
crew.  I postulate that there is an incredible desire on the part of most
people to get into space, but a great lack of qualified people who can actually
get those jobs, thus the salaries for space workers are generally much, much
higher than those for a ground worker.

  Thus, social standing will affect a characters income and spending habits
over a range of two orders of magnitude, also depending on what planet they
come from and the conditions they grew up under.  These then may be modified
as needed to produce a real variety of standards of living, as well as a quick
comparison between an adventurer\'s wealth and the typical planet denezin.

  Anyone see any serious flaws?  Anything that might make this a bit easier to
compute?

  With any luck, I should be able to get this done by semester\'s end.  Those
pesky finals may get in the way...

4. From: "MARK A. POWER" <uabmap01@asnuab.asn.net>
Subject: Trade Digest

A couple of things for everyones perusal.

1:	Where do cargos come from?

An incident from the campaign I run brought on some questions.
Our heros met a free trader coming into system at the same time.
Since two traders arriving at a low population world (Paya/Aramis) at
the same time could have interesting consequences if they\'re both
trying to sell the same things, I randomly determined that the free
trader was carrying (among other things) 25 tons of silver on spec.
This didn\'t have any bearing on things until later in the week, when
one of the cargos for sale locally was silver.  Since Paya has a
population of around 1000, most cargos are probably trans-shipped
anyway, but this made the situation glaringly obvious.  How should
this effect cargo availability, price, etcetera?

2:	Another trade system?

I just picked up the new (#37) Challenge.  In it was a Bestiary column
on a small bird commonly found as a pet.  The interesting part was the
entry given for the "Lasias Lowalaa as cargo".

Lots:			1 kilogram each
Value:			Cr1000 each
Transport Price:	Cr50 per week
Transport Cost:		Cr5 each per week
Market:			Luxury item
Restriction:		+2
Availability:		7+
Special Handling:	Live animal.  Cannot be shipped in low berth.
			Special feeding requirements.

Does this format look familiar?  Is it for a trade and speculation
system we haven\'t considered?  Might it be useful for our system?

Mark

A few words about AI: The idea presented is an interesting one, and
certainly would be a lot of fun. The limitation here, however, is
that AI comes into being only at higher tech levels. See Book 8,
Robots, for more on this. Also, remember the good old Kinunir in
Adventure One, which went slightly wacko and killed the ship\'s crew. (It also
lied to me a great deal when I found the ship and tried to use it for
my own. It ignored the jump instructions I gave it and turned itself
into the navy at Pixie, who payed me a mere CR25,000. Grrrrrr.)


About ships: Most of you have already seen my thoughts about
Megatraveller ship design. To be perfectly honest (Joe and Gary
forgive me if you\'re out there) I hate it. The original system was
not perfect at all, but I am willing to sacrifice some realism in 
return for more playability. I was going to write some material
based on some of my old High Passage stuff for Traveller`s Digest,
but the ship system is such a drag that I think I shall now pass
on the deal.

Let me ask this: Is there anyone who preferrs the Megatraveller ship design
system out there? Let\'s hear from you. I would be most interested in
learning about your reasons.

Funny my ships keep coming out 10-15% cheaper. You may be doing something
wrong but if u are building a starship especially a merchant vessel here
are a few tips that will save u money and cargo space.

1. Decide on cargo space first.
2. Make Hull streamlined and not Airframe.
3. Don\'t put in EM Mask. Don\'t need it and not worth it either.
4. On cargo ships atleast u don\'t need Elecvtronic Circuit Protection.
5. Go for as small a maneuver drive as possible.
6. Go for smallest possible P-plant even if it means Agility 0. With the new
rules P-plants are really fuel hungry. It makes agility harder to reach but
a lot fewer MT ships have high agility anyway. The way rules are set up 
the smaller the ship the more likely it has high agility. Somehow seeing
a 100,000 t dreadnought pull agility 6 was a little hard to envision in old
High Guard.
7. Try to approach the 30/90 day limit on fuel for duration. It is not necessary
as long as you can keep it over 14/42 higher is preferable on Merch ships and
some warships with long loiter times (SDB\'s etc).
8. Try small staterooms for crew not bunks. Book suggests that bunk are for
vehicles etc I think. If requiring a large stateroom price it 250,000
not 400,000 as mentioned in Ref\'s book under accomodations. This is not
in the flowchart part unfortunately.

9. The Dweeb who designed the Subsidized merchant is wrong. He also bungled
the patrol cruiser(see my earlier posting). Subsidized merchant works
with Comp Model 2bis and reduced endurance I think its 22/66. Cost is higher
too but still less than old Traveller & High Guard costs. 
10. Problems appear at low tech levels where High Guard or Traveller old
designs CANNOT be directly translated. So consider this a new game and just
downgrade those designs until they can fly.

At least one game that I\'ve looked over (played once, lack of players) had
AI\'s.  The gig was that an accident/failure would cause an AI to have a
malfunction, even if the accident was NOT a direct result of the AI hardware.

If the AI was part of something like a WarBot, you were in serious trouble!
The higher in development the AI was, the easier it was to have a malfunction.

It changes from "unusual accident causes dumb exploratory robot to fly erratic
course" to "accident causes smart medibot to inject wrong drug" to "common
failure causes inteligent life replicant to demonstrate epileptic seizure" to
........sneeze on superbrain wrong and it\'ll vaporize you while predicting
exactly where each of your component atoms will end up with an error rate of
less than 10^-999 percent.)
					How\'s that for interesting!

I\'m not sure of the specifics, but its important to remember that the designs
in the Imperial Encyclopedia are standard designs and thus have a (I think)
20% discount because they are mass produced in such great quantities.

This is is reponse to Jim Cunningham\'s article about the starship design etc.

First let me say that the editors of the Ref\'s manual(Joe Fugate?) etc ought
to be lynched. Second after all the kinks, I like the system. I heard the
same(its too hard...) arguments when High Guard came out and this system is
more playable. Ship design I admit is hard. However the design implicitly
makes a big deal out of a preplan. Meaning u have to be fairly specific about
the ship BEFORE u start. Add ons are a no-no. The design adds more flavor 
and makes u feel as if your ship has more than 1)Hull 2)Weapons 3)Computer
and 4) Cargo Hold. It gives the players more options as to what their ship 
can or cannot do. BTW Jim if you are having problems with ship design why don\'t
you ask for help. I thought that was part of the reason for this list. I\'d 
be glad to build you your ship given your specifications and I\'ll e-mail u
the math too. I think that\'s a good idea and if people don\'t mind I\'d like 
those with good ship design on their hands to post it. It could be made a part 
of the digest. I personally would like to see <TL15 ships. I have a few TL13
or so that I\'ll soon post. Am trying to convert Vargr Corsair to MT currently
so if anyone has ideas let me know.

[I reformatted this article, before it was distributed, to make it more
readable--James]

This is in response to Ameer Sulaiman\'s response to Jim Cunningham\'s
article about starship design.

After all the kinks, I don\'t like the system.  I liked the High Guard
design rules the first time I saw them.  That\'s why I bought the book.
It takes time to design a ship in High Guard, but it\'s worth it.  You
get something that you couldn\'t have made before.  When I saw the
MegaTraveller design rules I was suprised by their length and by how
little they add to play.  Every goodie except sensors was already
available, either in Robots or in Striker.

In High Guard it is easy to preplan.  You find the total of the fixed
displacement components and the total of the percentage based
components.  You only need to allow a few extra power points for weapons
and agility.  This is enough to tell you the size of the hull.  In
MegaTraveller, one must consider control points, mass, volume (in kl),
and power ranging from Kilowatts to Gigawatts.  The best you can do is
take a guess at how big it will be (not easy for someone designing their
first ship).  Then come the goodies, pages of them.  How can you resist
the latest technology? What do you need on your ship? Is the neural
activity sensor really good for anything? How many forms of radios do
you need? What about a robot arm? Can I get my ship to load itself?
After those pages, the margin built in to your guess (assuming you were
lucky enough to have a margin for error) can dissappear, making you
recalculate every volume dependent component.

The design of any small craft under 20 tons has become a special case
under the new rules.  This is important as it is not possible to build a
fighter like the one in the Imperial Encyclopedia.  To see one of the
more obvious flaws, note that the power plant generates 186 Mw, while
the 2 beam lasers consume 250 Mw each when they fire.  Keeping track of
volume and mass while trying to shove enough components into a tiny
package to make a decent vehicle is not a task I enjoy.  Anybody try to
build a special grav vehicle to go with that custom ship?

Combining Striker and High Guard was a mistake.  It is the source of the
problems with (very) small craft, and it adds little of use to the game.
 The weapons and electronics that go into a starship are very different
from those that go into tank.  I doubt I will ever have occasion to
mount a howitzer on a starship, and I don\'t even want to think about a
tank mounting a UCP T particle accelerator.

Now you know why the F-16 and F-18, originally supposed to be cheap, light
fighters, got to be big and expensive!

>Combining Striker and High Guard was a mistake.

No, that is a good idea. It is their implementation that may be at fault.
In fact, I always did dislike the High Guard assumption that mass and volume
were always the same; that density is constant for all ship components.
There\'s another thing I don\'t like, though. If your ship is big enough, why
can\'t you have more than one major weapon? Alright, so the main spinal mount
forms the "keel" of the ship. But what\'s wrong with a battleship having two
factor T meson guns on that keel? Come to that, what about a catamaran-type
design? Or, at the very least, a factor T meson gun and a couple of factor
J guns as secondaries.

> The weapons and electronics that go into a starship are very different
>from those that go into tank.

Not necessarily true. For one thing, according to Mercenary, at high TL\'s
gunships and SDB\'s become virtually indistinguishable. And I did design a
vehicle which took the standard starship turret-launched missiles - that
way, it could be re-armed at any starport of adequate TL.

One thing I do like about the new design system is that you can now have
spinal mount, bay mount and turret versions of the same type of weapon in
one ship. In High Guard, you could not have bay mount particle accelerators
and particle accelerator barbettes on the same ship, for example.

I need a few destroyer class hulls for a Mega Traveller mini-campaign.

Should be less than 5000 tons and atleast greater than 2000t displacement.
No black globes and Tech 15 or less. Price no object. Should preferably
have a small troop complement. If anyone has any designs available 
that meet the req. I would be obliged.

	Thanks.

Greetings fellow Travellers!

I have a basic question.  How do you people play the Traveller\'s Aid Society?

All my information has come from the MegaTraveller books, and I am 99% ignorant
of what went on in the "original" manuals, so bear that in mind, please.
("New Referee, please do not bruise...")

Things like:

How do you handle day-to-day TAS functioning?

Do members get free lodging at a TAS hostel, or do they pay?

Are non-members allowed to pay for a room?

Every planet cannot have a TAS office- what are your criteria for TAS office
placement?

Anybody have a good layout of a TAS hostel?  Perhaps the one on Regina?  (If
so, would some kind soul post/mail me a copy?)

What kind of political involvement to you allow the TAS, if any?

What kind of services, besides picking up passages, do you offer to players?

For 1 *Million* credits, shouldn\'t a member have a room-for-life at his \'home\'
hostel?   (Think of the classic image in literature of the social clubs in
London.  As an aside- read some P.G. Woodhouse: some great characters to update
and inflict on your players- some very funny NPC material in there!)

(Adrian - do such clubs still exist?)


In short, what *about* the TAS?  Any and all discussion appreciated.

Players don\'t get to know that information.  TAS just happens.

> Do members get free lodging at a TAS hostel, or do they pay?
That depends on what part of the galaxy they are currently in, and the
mood of the referee...

> Are non-members allowed to pay for a room?
Depends upon how full the hotel is, who they are with, how much they
appear to be worth, and the mood of the referee.

> Every planet cannot have a TAS office- what are your criteria for TAS office

Even though every planet is not able to have a TAS office, there are
many native hotel chains which will give substansial discounts to TAS
members.  Again, this depends on the mood of the referee.
	
> Anybody have a good layout of a TAS hostel?  Perhaps the one on Regina?  (If

The last N groups to visit my layout of a hostel (sometimes part of TAS,
sometimes not) have refered to it by many names; TAS hostle, Hotel
California, The Mall, and Hotel of Death, just to name a few.  I don\'t yet
have the floor plans in machine readable form but if you send me your
address I send you photocopies.

> What kind of political involvement to you allow the TAS, if any?
In the multiverse that I like to romp in, the TAS has very strange
politics.  Very few of my players have discovered that the TAS is run by
some *very* old humans.  No one has yet figured out exactly what the TAS\'s
goals are.

> What kind of services, besides picking up passages, do you offer to players?
That depends on where the office is located, what the players ask for, what
the NPC\'s ask for, how much money the players appear to have, and the mood
of the referee.

> For 1 *Million* credits, shouldn\'t a member have a room-for-life at his \'home\'
> hostel?   
Yeah, but it is probably located in a very boring section of the galaxy.

> In short, what *about* the TAS?  Any and all discussion appreciated.
1) The TAS is not an Imperial run organization.
2) The goals of the TAS are as of yet unknown.
3) The TAS has access to a great deal of capital.
4) The TAS has a great deal of political power. (Old boys network)
5) The TAS is beyond the reach of laws.
     (What, you won\'t do what we say?  No problem.  We\'ll list you
      planet as an amber travel zone.  That will cut back the honest
      tourists and attract the player character terrorists...)

I hope that\'s good for starters.

Hello TML Listees!

As of today I am accepting requests to move people from "instant"
delivery to "digest" delivery.  The current "instant" delivery method
sends TML messages to you as quickly as possible, giving you immediate
feedback on questions you mail to the list, and individual control over
the messages.  The new, "digest" delivery method coalesces 3 days\' worth
of messages and sends a single-message "digest" every 3 days; providing
you with less frequent mail interruption, a higher signal-to-noise
ratio, and (unfortunately) slower response to any questions.

Both distribution methods are now running side-by-side; each of you can
choose which method of distribution you want.  Right now all of you are
marked for "instant" delivery *, and will stay that way unless I hear
otherwise.  If you\'d like to change to "digest" delivery, just send me
mail requesting the change, and I\'ll cheerfully do it.

[* - Digest delivery beta-testers are being left as they now are, as
"digest" recipients.  You people know who you are.]

On another topic, list traffic has taken a dip lately.  Everyone must
have gone back to work :-).

At the risk of charges of treason, I must confess that the Traveller
and MegaTraveller game mechanics leave me unsatisfied.  Traveller combat
made a target either automatically hit, or automatically missed ---- or
so it seemed.  (Just *try* to hit a character in combat armor with your
wimpy little autopistol.)  Starship combat was even worse:  it was easy,
though expensive, to design a small ship that was impervious to anything
short of a spinal mount meson gun.  (So I\'m exaggerating a little....
But not much.)

MT did not fix these things very well.  The new all-purpose task system
is a good idea, but it is a pretty chunky step-function (ie, "granular"
in the popular syntax).

But Traveller has always been a great game not because of its mechanics,
but because of its background.  I like the Imperium.  I like the character
generation, with its inherent way of fleshing out a character history.
I like the "look and feel."

My question:  has anyone had success transplanting another system of
game mechanics into the Traveller universe?  (I have done so with 
a homemade system, with a fair to good level of success.  But it would
be nice to find a commercial system that would work as well.)

Free lodging, but such hostels aren\'t the best accomodation around. They aren\'t
bad, but they\'re not usually luxury either.

 
> Are non-members allowed to pay for a room?
Yes.
 
> Every planet cannot have a TAS office- what are your criteria for TAS office

It must be within the Imperium. Usually, it should have a decent starport and
a reasonable sized population. Perhaps starport C at least, and population
at least a few thousand.

None.

For one thing, a place to leave their weapons. Unless you own your own ship,
owning a laser rifle has serious problems if you want to visit a civilised
planet, unless you can find somewhere safe to leave it while you wander around.

I think they exist, though not quite as they used to be. For one thing, women
are now admitted. (Curious, that: no-one objects to women-only clubs.)

Hi.

My players have found and repaired a Type J "Seeker".  It was marooned on an
Exile world, the crew having been killed by the Exiles.  It\'s a little beat-up,
but it flies.

My question is this: How to handle the savlage rights?

There is a good article in the latest _Challange_ on Prize Ships and amount of
prize money that goes to the crew of the capturing vessel.  I am considering
just using the same basic system to handle salvage rights, with a few
modifications.

Can anyone think of some issues I need to consider (Aside from not letting them
get too wealthy...)?

>My question is this: How to handle the savlage rights?

Recovery of a "lost" ship has always been a favorite plot device for me.
Here\'s how I have handled salvage rights.

The Imperium recognizes the right of "finders keepers."  However, Imperial
law requires the new owners of a ship to assume responsibility for any
burden of debt that may rest with it.  Usually, this means the salvagers
must assume or pay off the remaining portion of the purchasing loan.  They
are also liable for any other outstanding fees, fines, or liens against the
ship ---- up to the current value of the vessel.

In addition, the salvagers must pay a fee to officially re-register the
ship.  This fee is typically 10% to 30% of the current value of the craft.
(For a quick percentage, multiply the applicable law level by 2%, then add
10%.)  The re-registration can take a while, particularly if there is some
question about the circumstances surrounding the "recovery" of the ship.
(This is a good opportunity for impatient characters to try out their
bribery and/or admin skills, in order to speed the paperwork.)

Note that all this assumes there are no other claimants to the ship.  The
fun of protracted litigation is left as an exercise for the creative GM.

For the Seeker in question, there is probably no outstanding loan.
(Seekers are mostly old ships, so it has probably been paid off already.)
The players should be able to pay the re-registration fee and a few bribes,
and walk away with a ship.  If they lack the necessary capitol, they can
negotiate a new loan (using the ship as collateral) or submit the ship for
auction.  Even with auction and re-registration fees, they should come out
of the deal with something like 40% of the true value of the ship.

If you want to keep then poor, you\'ll have to rip them off.  Sticky legal
problems are the easy out for the GM.

The way I handled this in previous campaigns was that the ship was held in the
nearest A or B class starport for a certain time, and a message circulated to
the effect that it had been found. The owner would have to claim it during that
time, and prove their claim. The bank which had financed the ship could also
put in a claim. If the owner showed up, the ship was handed back and the
finders got a percentage of its cash value, based mainly on its condition. If
no owner showed up, but the bank did, then the finders had the option of taking
over the ship, and making all outstanding payments to the bank; or handing the
ship to the bank, and claiming salvage money as above. If neither owner nor
bank showed up, the finders got the ship. If the ship had some military
significance, the Imperial Navy could intervene and seize the ship, and maybe
pay the finders.

In a campaign in which I was playing, we acquired a Vargr corsair this way. We
were attacked, but captured it, and then went to the nearest Naval base to
register it. We persuaded the Navy to waive the bit about waiting for the
owners to show up, as they were most unlikely to do so! (They were alive - we
released them - but obviously Vargr corsairs would not go to an Imperial base
to claim a corsair ship!)

First things first. I have received *no* traffic regarding system
generation in the past  two weeks. This means that everyone
knows all there is to know about star system generation, that the
current generation system is ideal and supplies all the information
that everyone needs, and that everyone already has their own ideal
computer program to generate systems, planets, shipping lanes, etc.
I\'m glad that everyone is happy. (Now that I\'ve lit a few fires under
a few seats, especially my own ;-).

You may remember my mentioning a program for a simulation of *real*
(yes, *real*) star system generation based on an article in the
Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS) called 
\'Extrasolar Planetary Systems: a Microcomputer Simulation\'. I do
have a copy of this program, but I haven\'t been able to get it to
run on my Sun-3. I have been in touch with the author of the program
(burdick%hpda@hplabs.hp.com) who has given some ideas on where to
look, but I haven\'t had the time, and may not in the near future.
The program is repored to work on HP9000/350, Sun-3, and IBM-
compatible PCs (note my earlier warning). This program provides all
sorts of neat information from planetary albedo and axial tilt to
eccentricty of orbit and surface acceleration and everything in between.
If you would like a copy of this program just to have or to try and
fix (the author thought the problem may be in the accretion
routines and the random number routines that are called), let me
know and I\'ll email a copy. Note that the shar file is about 80K, so
I may have to compress it to get it past mailers with size restrictions
or break it into parts.

[This was sent to traveller-request, but obviously was destined for
traveller.  I\'m forwarding it.  I also reformatted the long lines and
ran it through the spell checker -- James]

I would let them have the ship, charge them a whopping registration fee
(or it would be like an unregistered car, but with penalties like
confiscation possible) and make them upgrade some equipment to current
standards (maybe a triple cost overhaul - latest comm/safety stuff
required by Imperium) Also, depending on the reactions of the officials,
bribes, and circumstances of the original disappearance, and how well
they documented their find (pictures of it before they moved it, records
of the search for the original crew, etc..) I might impound it for a
long/short while for an investigation (length depending on bribes, admin
skill, friends in high places, etc...).

It could be made into several interesting (or frustrating) encounters.
If they are still too wealthy, it could always have a major breakdown.
Maybe the jump drive has gone bad and needs to be replaced.  This should
be discovered in the overhaul.  (If the players are all ignorant, and
don\'t get a second opinion, maybe the yard will try to replace something
that works fine, and charge the players.  Or use a defective part.  Or
switch an old broken piece for a good one on their ship).

Or you could just use a pirate to blow a hole in the ship that they
would have to get fixed.  Never any problem separating money from
players.  To be fair though, if they stick out an initial period of
hassles/expenses, then they should be considered to have earned the ship
and shaken out the bugs.  Then let them use it normally.

A number of people in the mailing list have suggested some variations to 
GDW Traveller and to MegaTrav.  I have been working on a variant system 
since about 1980.  It keeps a lot of the Trav syntax and simplicity.  If
any of you read the fanzine "A&E" then you will already be quite familiar
with the rules and the campaign background.  Some of the over basics to
the variant which I simply call "Cosmos" are:

* tech levels redfined as technology, energy production, information 
  transfer and culture.

* non-Imperium background with tech level-0 to tech level-40.

* time travel on multiple time lines; including pre big bang and post
  big suck.

* Expanded skills limited by EDU and tech level (similar to MegaTravs
  expanded list).

* Skill improvement based on techlevel.

* Variant psionic system.

* Force science (techno magic) system.

* Massive alternate history for campaign background.

* tiered levels of complexity for starship combat and design from simple
  to complex.

* supporting software written in c to run under most flavors of Unix.

Most of this is on-line from this posting addess and can be sent to the
mailing list if there are enough requests (I would be some work packaging
it).

Ok...  That\'s part of what I\'m looking for.  The IE says:

"Combat Drug:  Taken by fighters... Prior to combat, this drug increases
personal strength and endurance.  The effect begins 30 seconds after being
taken and lasts for about 10 minutes.  When the effect wears off, the user
suffers 1D in wounds."


What it neglects to say is HOW MUCH it increases your scores in Strength and
Endurance...  It better be more than just one of each, or it won\'t be worth
risking 6 points of wounds, which would knock *any* of my players out cold!

How do you play it?  Do you use an arbitrary amount of increase, or a variable
die roll?

On page 44 of Book 2, Starships, the old books (2nd edition), it says, and I 
quote:

COMBAT DRUG is taken by fighters (usually military personnel) prior to 
combat. It increases personal strength and endurance each by _two_. The
effect begins two combat rounds after being taken, and lasts for 30 combat
rounds. When the effect wears off, the user receive 1D in wounds.

Your welcome, sorry it took so long but I just moved and had to find which

Well, I\'d be interested in seeing some the above.  New ideas are always worth

The following is an update to the program I recently mentioned that generates
*real* star systems. This update fixes a problem with Suns, but should
be implemented regardless. Many thanks go out to Jonathan Bayer
(ispi!jbayer@uunet.UU.NET) who found the problem and the fix.

The config.h file contains definitions that provide tailoring for
specific hardware and operating systems. This file contains the
following defines:

> #ifdef SUN
> #define LONG_RAND
> #endif

Here is Jonathan\'s fix:
> I just found your problem on the Sun.  The define shown above is in
> config.h.  However, config.h is included LAST in all the source files.
> Since the LONG_RAND flag is used in consts.h, it is not being used
> properly.  Move all the #include "config.h" to be the first local file
> included and your problem should go away.

Also, Jonathan mentioned that he has some patches for the DOS version
which I will forward as soon as I receive them.

Trav#1  COSMOS CHARACTER GENERATION 

These rules are house rules for character generation.  They are intended for
tech level 12 humans and humanoids.  There are variations for other tech 
levels and species forms (intelligent machines, so on).  I will try to
post these later.

Tables referenced in this posting will follow later.

- -John Redden

______________________________________________________________________________

Human Species character generation

Method A.  

	Roll the character out of a GDW Traveller book.  Mercenaries
and High Guard are closely inspected.  Scouts are ok. (For aliens
Vargr can be used depending on where the character starts.)  Give it
to the GM for manual converison to League Comos.

Method B.

	Design and Random mix.  First is basic character generation:

	1. The player divides 48 characteristic points among STR, DEX,
END, INT, EDU, and SOC.

2. The new character has a base of 3 skill points to divide among the
skills skills associated with previous experience.  To this base more
points are added depending on the characters INT, EDU or SOC (to which
the player cannot assign more than the species maximum).  If an of
these charcteristics are below 7 then there is no gain but no penalty.

Characteristic advantages for skill pts:
- ----
INT		EDU		SOC		number points gained
- ----
7-9		7-8		7-8		1
10-12		9-11		9-10		2
13-14		12-13		11-12		3
15		14		13-14		4
<for each       <for each	<no further	+ 1
 + 1>		 + 1>		 gain>
- ----

3. Roll 4D-3 on Previous Experience Chart #1 (basic).  If an 11 or 12
is rolled on this chart then roll on Previous Experience Chart #2
(extended) or choose the nondescript character (generic label
character).

Those characters with Scout, League Security, Soldier, Sailor,
Colonist automatically get ATHLETICS-1 at no skill point cost.  Skill
points are added to the base amount accrued so far.  The base amont is
then used to choose skills from the Previous Experience Skill Chart.

The highest initial level is 2.  Any chacteristic modifiers are then added
to this level.

A GM special might be a charcter that owns a starship, a diplomat with 
league rank, a character that knows magic or psionic skills.

- ----

4. Roll 2D to detemine APP or apparrent physical beauty.  At high(er)
tech levels APP may be adjusted upward (or downward in some odd cases)
for a cost of 1000 CR per point by a surgeon with MEDICAL-4 and the
proper equipment.

5. Roll 2D for FOR or universal force.  All living and some
"nonliving" things have a force binding their relationship to time,
energy and space.  Among other attributes FOR is the characters
ability to manipulate and withstand MAGIC.  A high FOR does not mean
the character knows magic.

6. Roll 3D-3 for base psionic ability.  Psionics are similar but very
different from FOR.  They represents the characters mental will to
effect subtle causation of mental and physical events around them.
PSI (base psionic ability) is used to determine two computed
attributes PSS (PSionic Stamina) and PSR (PSionic Resistance).

   PSS = (2 * PSI) + STR + END
   PSR = (2 * PSI) + INT + END

7. Roll 2D to determine the characters current worth in CR and yearly
(360 days) salary.  Add one to the roll for EACH LEVEL of money
related skill (ADMIN, BARGAINING, BRIBARY, DIPLOMACY, FORGERY,
GAMBLING, LAW, ORATORY, PROPAGANDA).  If a skill is known at LEVEL-0
then a roll of 10+ (ten or greater on 2D for tech level 12, any
character atribute modifiers apply INT, EDU etc.).

   Next add or subtract to the original 2D (not to LEVEL-0 skill rolls
if they are necessary) the modifier from Social (SOC) Dice Modifier
Table.  This now determines the total accured roll.

The entire procedure just outlined is done once for current credit and
one time for yearly salary on Accrued Credit Table

8. Roll 2D to determine the characters age.  Then add or subtract to
the roll using the Age dice modifier table.  Use the total accrued age
to determine age on the Character age table.

- ----|----

each pt add 1     each pt add 1		|
- ----

Method C.

Extended random design.  Go through steps 1., 2., 3., 4., 5. in Method
B.  Then go through Extended Human Character Generation steps.
Finally go through steps 6., 7. and 8. in Method B to complete the
character.

Method D.

Deliberate design with advantages and disadvantages.  Assign 60 points
to STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU, SOC, FOR, PSI.  Do not go over the species
limit or the limits implied by the current tech level.

Choose a profession from League Cosmos professions list.  Start with a
pool of 5 points.  Apply the points to the characters skills,
characteritics or wealth according to Point allocation table.

- ----

	Characteristics (INT, FOR, PSI)		2
	Credits in current wealth (per 25k)	1
	Credits in current salary (per 25k)	2
- ----

Then you may "buy" additional points for the character by taking a
number of disadvantages corresponding to the points.  Additional
points to correspond to disadvantage points on a one-to-one basis.  A
character with a 6 disadvantage points is fairly warped and may not be
comfortable for some people to play.  By 9 you may really have a
flamer.

Some disadvantages can be built directly into the design mechanics.
The characters charcteristics (all except APP, which hasn\'t been added
to the charcter yet) may be traded for skills.  Skill points may be
traded for chracteristics.  Points may be gained by taking negative
skill levels in skills.  Minor skills are worth less than major skills
(minor=.5 pt, major = 1 pt per negative level).

Other disadvantages are built indirectly.  The charcter is a religious
fanatic, has a great fear of hyperspace or even being off a planet, a
person or organization is after them.  In some cases oly the Gaming
Master may know what the charcters disadvantages are.

Last the characters wealth and age are generated.  Start at "10" on
the Accrued Credit Table for Current Credit and Yearly salary.  You
may reduce the number in either column on a 3:1 ratio to make your
charcter poorer in either current money or yearly salary to get
disadvantage points.  For example, the character can get a
disadvantage point by having 13k current credits instead of 23k
current credits.  The salary level may be increased one per .5
disadvantage point spent (this assumes that some are left from skills
and characteristics).  Money related skills DO NOT apply in this
algorithm.

Next choose any age above 21 unless age was used as a disadvantage.

Obviously these designed characters are directly subject Gaming Master
scutiny.

Method E.

Build a character using components from Methods A through D.  Just
explain it to the Gaming Master.

Method F.

Deliberatly design a character with no disadvantages or dice rolling.
This is useful when a certain type of character is needed for a
scenario.  Again subject to direct scrutiny by the Gaming Master.

Cosmos #2

Life form stats.  Exotic aliens and machine lifeforms have modified
derivitives of these stats.

___________________________________________________________________________

These are the character charcteristics in Cosmos.  They are a natural
part of each character and are not learned.

    END is a measure of the pain and the body pts threshold for the
        species.  Carnivores, herbivorous mammals and reptiles
        all have a higher END than humans.  Also END represents the mass,
        constitution and hit points to unconsciousness for the species.
	It is possbile for an alien species to have more than one set of
	ENDs.  Damage is usually removed from END first.

        If END is broken into subcatagories END(HP) represents mass and hit
	points and END(PA) represents the pain threshold.

    DEX is a measure of direct damage to the nervous systemic
        threshold of the species.  This is the equivalent of
        secondary shock.  If sufficient damage is suffered the
        PC must obtain modern (tech level 6-8+) medical attention
        or risk the type of shock related death common in lower
        tech levels.  This also brings up the possibility of a
        nasty high tech weapon that destroys DEX but leaves the
        body intact.  It also represents the general quickness, speed 
        and dexderity of the species.  It is possible for an alien species to
   	habe more than one set of DEXs.  Damage is usually removed
	from DEX second.
 	
	If DEX is broken into subcomponents, DEX(NER) represents nervous
	systemic threshold and DEX(AGL) represents the quickness of the
	character.

    STR is a measure of the primary shock threshold.  When damage
        reaches this level the PC must receive regenerative medicine
        (not really available in late 20th century our time).  STR also
        represents the pure physical strength of the species.  Damage is
	usually done to STR last.  It also possible to have an alien species
	with more than one set of STRs.

	If STR is broken down into subcomponents STR(PRI) represents the
	primary shock threshold and STR(PHY) represents physical strength.

    INT is the measure of memory deductive and analytical thinking.  Multiple
        INTs would only exist in a naturally "schizophrenic" being.

    EDU represents the total sum of knowldge and conscious learned behavior.
	It is limited to TECH LEVEL+3 for a given culture.  Multiple EDUs
 	are similar to multiple INTs.

    SOC represents the socialization index of the character.  It also 
        represents the index of unconscious learned behavior.  It is limited
        to TECH LEVEL+3 for a given culture.  Multiple SOCs are similar to
	multiple INTs.

    APP is player asssigned.  Its represents physical presense and beauty.
	In a high tech game APP is purchased.

    FOR is the natural energy rating of the character.

    PSI is base for mental energy of the character.

18 7.36              136     300       +4  -2 

An average human and animal (or alien) with the same mass should have 
approximately the same hit points to unconsciousness.  Fatigue points
are optional.  If fatigue points are used there are two counts versus
END, not just one.  Obviously there are a nubmer of mechanized armors that
eliminate all fatigue point loss.

    The END DM modifies the number of END points assigned to the characters by
the player.  If the characters END or DEX goes below 2 or above F use the
DM against STR.  If the case comes up where both END and/or STR and/or DEX is
2 or F then the modifier is lost.

   Home world  STR D END DM       DMs for the characters homeworld conform
   G range                        to DM limits for PC mass.  If STR
                                  goes below 2 and a negative DM is
2  (-).2-.218  -4     -2          rolled it is subtracted from END.
3  .219-.236   -3     -1          If STR is at F and a positive DM
4  .237-.545   -2                 is rolled, it is added to END.
5  .546-.727   -1                 If STR and END are both F and a
6  .728-.909                      positive DM is rolled then the
7  .910-1.099                     DM is lost.  If STR and END are
8  1.1-1.272                      both 2 then the penalty is ignored.
9  1.272-1.454 +1

3. Roll 2D six times (one time for each characteristic) to determine the
   effect of the genetic engineer at the characters \'birth-gen\'.

10  +3           +2        +1                  +1
11  +4           +2        +1        +1        +1
12  +5           +2        +2        +1        +1        +1

Discussion: Genetic engineers focus on certain preconditions thus the
INT characteristic is likely to be altered.  APP is the easiest to
change and also the easiest to change the wrong way.  After
programming these the genetic engineer attempts to alter END, STR and
DEX.  There is a slight chance that genetic makeup will alter the PCs
social behavior (SOC).  Genetic factors do not influence EDU (EDU is
100% learned behavior for gaming purposes).  The average tech level
for genetic engineering in League Cosmos is 12.

Environment Descriptors

1. Artificial- is supported by a life support system. characters that
come from this background tend to be trained in skills that don\'t
require open space or randomized social interaction.  Martial arts may
seem foreign to them.  Learned behavior is intensified.

 adv apps: EDU characteristic, ADMIN, CHEM, COMP, ELECT, ENGINEER,
              GRAV, LAW, LING, MATH, MEDICAL, MUSIC, PHARM, PHYSICS, WRITING,
              VACC SUIT.


 dis apps: ATHLETICS, BRAWL, GUN CBT, RIDING, SKIING, SOC SCIENCE,
              STREETWISE, SWIMMING.

2. Hydroplanet- The environment is water.  For standard TRAV assume
90% water or better.  As such certain skills are distant to the
character.

    adv apps: ATHLETICS (water sports), SWIMMING, VEHICLE (water only).

    dis apps: ATHLETICS (nonwater sports), JUMPING, RIDING, SKIING (for
               those planets without extreme seasonality), VEHICLE
               (nonwater).

3. Arid planet- In this environment water is a rarity.  Characterss
from this environment are used to uniformity and quietude.  Silent
movement comes natural to them.

    adv apps: STEALTH, SURVIVAL, VEHICLE (air only), WILDERNESS CAMO,
              WILDERNESS TRACKING.

    dis apps: SKIING, SWIMMING, VEHICLE (land or water).

4. Hydro vegetation planet- has an abundance of water and plant life.
characters from this environment are used to easy camouflage in
natural cover.  Silence dosn\'t always seem necessary to hide oneself.

    adv apps: BIOLOGY, BONTANY, SWIMMING, VEHICLE(water and air only).

    dis apps: STEALTH, VEHICLE(ground only), WILDERNESS CAMO.

5. Typical ecological environment-

    adv apps: none.

    dis apps: none.

Seasonal Descriptors

6. No planetary seasonality- characters that originate from a planet
with a lack of seasonality tend to be somewhat bored and \'epicurian\'.
They tend not to notice certain subtle changes in the environment.

    adv apps: ACTING, ARTIST, ATHLETICS, DIPLOMACY, FORGERY, GAMBLING,
              HIDE ITEM, MUSIC, ORATORY, POETRY, SLIGHT OF HAND, WRITING.

    dis apps: PERCEPTION, PLANETOLOGY, SKIING(if not a cold planet),
              SURVIVAL.

7. Typical planetary seasonality-
 
   adv apps: none.

   dis apps: none.

8. Extreme planetary seasonality- is caused by eccentric orbits and/or
axial tilt and/or uneven star energy output.  Because of the harsh
conditions the penchant towards the arts is lacking in their behavior.

    adv apps: CHEM, LEADER, PLANETOLOGY, SURVIVAL, SWIMMING, SKIING,
              WILDERNESS CAMO, WILDERNESS TRACKING.

    dis apps: ACTING, ARTIST, MUSIC, POETRY, WRITING.

9. Artificial seasonality-
    adv apps: none.
    dis apps: none.

Population Descriptors

10. Sparse population- does not include large cities per se.  These
characters tend to be \'hickish\' in their behavior.

    adv apps: BARGAINING, BLADE CBT, BRAWLING, CLIMBING, JUMPING, RIDING,
              SURVIVAL, WILDERNESS CAMO, WILDERNESS TRACK.

    dis apps: ADMIN, ARTS OF LOVE, LAW, PROPAGANDA, SOCIAL SCIENCE,
              STREETWISE, URBAN CAMO.



11. Medium to dense population- characters from this environment are
familiar with large cities.

    adv apps: ADMIN, ARTS OF LOVE, CAROUSING, FORGERY, LAW, PROPAGANDA,
              STREETWISE, URBAN CAMO.

    dis apps: RIDING, SURVIVAL, WILDERNESS CAMO, WILDERNESS TRACK.

12. Clinical population- this environment is synonymous with an
artificial environment.

    adv apps: none.

    dis apps: none.

Discussion: Advantage applications derived from character background
are added to existing or become new skills.  Disadvantage applications
are subtracted from skills already assigned by the player.  If a skill
is reduced below level 1 it goes to level 0.  If the skill is
further reduced it stays at level 0.  A unit of an advantage
application starts at skill level 1 not at skill level 0.  In some
cases character characteristics themselves are augmentedor diminished.
They cannot be raised above the species maximum or below 2.

Good [morning...evening]!

As a newcomer to Traveller, I was wondering where all you folks situate your
campaigns.  I started with the MegaTraveller release, and I am content to use
the "Shattered Imperium" as a large-scale backdrop for my campaign.  This way I
can concentrate my creative energies on the smaller things that will mean more
to the players.

(You know, running an AD&D game was EASY-  One planet, a few parallel
realities, horses instead of spaceships...  Only the teleporters and the
probability travellers ever gave me any trouble.  Now I have to work.)

Is anyone else using the MT Rebellion senario?  How do the players like it?
Where are they based?  Considering the GDW-supplied timeline, what date is it
in your campaign?

As I have heard little or no response on my request for posting ship
designs, I have decided to put up a few. In general these are recognizable
as MT conversions of Trav or High Guard designs so they should not be a big
problem to set in. As ther are quite a few TL15 ships out there the ships will
in general be TL 13 or less. I would appreciate some e-mail acknowledgement
if u intend to use these ships. It would tell me if there is any need of these
or if I\'m just wasting my time.

Cosmos #4; A continuation of Cosmos Trav derived house rules

________________________________________________________________________

Skill Usage in COSMOS

The skill based system and the simplicity of the dice rolling
conventions are features that attracted me to TRAV.  The distance
between the skills (or what is called the cascade effect) in the
network determines its difficulty depending on the PCs background.

    There are several paradigms implied in Cosmos skill system.  The
first is what you could call a \'tree\' structure.  In this case a
generalized skill becomes a specialized skill in the next node \'down\'.
A specialized skill has the header SUBSKILL in the skill descriptions.
The second paradigm is what you could call a \'network\' structure.  In
this case skills are related (in either physical, Tech Level or
Cultural terms) to other kills.  In the skill descriptions SKILL
ASSOCIATIONS makes reference to the network attribute of a skill.
Many of these associations are cultural instead of technological.

    Notice that there is an associative function of combining of two
or more skills to make a generalized skill and a dissasociative
function of reducing skills to two or more atomic skills.  Also notice
that some skill combinations form skills that are obscure or
nonsensical.  These skills could be a tool for the GM to generate
attributes for alien cultures.  If a player wants a Character with
ASSASSIN-1 (a new skill to this list) they would first learn
ASSASSIN-0 (not very useful) and then learn ASSASSIN-1 and gain
ACTING-0, BRIBERY-0, CLIMBING-0, FORGERY-0, HIDE ITEM-0, etc.  Before
the Character could learn ASSASSIN-2 they would have to learn
ACTING-1, BRIBERY-1, and so on.  Can anybody out there guess what
associations to use for PHILOSOPHER (*snicker*)-1?  A very old
Character could have BEING-n where BEING is the total generalized set
of skills knowable by the given society.  MAGIC and PSIONICS are
treated differently because of their causal agents (they are effect
based *and* skill based).  MAGIC and PSIONICS are more common in a
continuum of existence where the transformation of energy into matter
takes place in a short amount of "time".  In Cosmos continuum the
transformation of matter into energy is commonplace (in a short amount
of "time") so MAGIC and PSIONICS are associated to BEING (and
NOTHINGNESS?).  Once learned (as you might guess) MAGIC is associated
to other skills to form "schools": MAGIC+PSYCHOLOGY, MAGIC+PHYSICS,
MAGIC+BIOLOGY, MAGIC+WRITING, so on.  Maybe JEDI KNIGHT-2 = MAGIC-1 +
PSIONICS-1 + BEING-1 ?  At extremely high tech levels the
transformations of energy and matter over a period of time is common
place so technological and magical skills are indistinguishable ( a
corollary of Clarks Law?).

    Some skills lend themselves to a large number of subskills.  The
obvious examples are skills like VEHICLE, GUN CBT, etc.  The distance
between the generalized skill ("root" node) and the specialized skill
("branch" node) is still 1, however it is easier for a Character to
learn a SUBSKILL than an ASSOCIATED skill.

    The makeup of a semantic network for any given species are
objective factors (the physics of the time-space-matter-energy
continuum... presumably the same for all species), subjective factors
(the species natural history and collective learned behavior), and the
tech level of the species, a combination of the first two.  Therefore,
the network implied for League Cosmos skills is different for higher
and lower tech levels and different for an alien species.  (for
example, the ANASI would never have MATH-2 without LAW-2 and SOCIAL
SCIENCE-1; Note the Anasi are an alien species at about tech level 24
that consider all activity subject to legal contracts).

      As an option we use negative skill levels for Characters that
attempt improvement of their skills and fail with a fumble.  They are
considered to have a psychological block against learning and using
the skill.  Their success roll goes to 12+.  Thus such a character with
GUN-CBT(-1) has a psychological fear of guns.

Cosmos Skill Usage Dice Rolling Conventions

Saves vrs. EDU:

	Common knowledge skills such as knowing how to operate the
local Media Comm Network, how to turn on a tech unit, recognizing a
grav driven LEV, knowing a particular video magazine name etc.,
typically is a save vrs.  EDU on 3D.  Positive and negative DMs are
applied according to the difficulty of the roll.  The difficulty level
of EDU saves at 3D+2 is equivalent to STREETWISE-0, SOCIAL SIENCE-0,
MATH-0, HISTORY-0, etc.

Saves vrs STR, END, and DEX:

	Common physical skills have similar mechanics to those that
are knowledge based.  The difficulty level at 3D+2 is equivalent to
ATHLETICS-0, JUMP-0, etc.

Skills before Tech Level Zero

	Pre intelligent or animal skills are possible and numerous.  
BITE-2, RUNNING-6, JUMP-5, FLY-2 are examples.

Skills with EDU as component

	Skills that have EDU as a modifier are subject to tech level
limitations.  This usually means that trying to get a skill greater than:

(Tech Level)/2   

is research.  Thus the character would be trying to temporarily or
permanently increase the tech level.

   published four times by GDW: twice in the old JTAS (and reprinted in BEST

   probability theory and obscure Traveller-mythos trivia. I am NOT a rules
   lawyer, and cannot answer questions on rules technicalities. If someone
   needs a librarian service, I own every item ever sold by GDW on Traveller
   and most of the non-GDW ones, particularly from before the MegaTraveller

Do you (or anyone else, for that matter) know if I can get hold of miniatures
of Zhodani, or of Imperial military figures? Preferably 15mm, so I can use them
with ship deck plans. I know of Grenadier\'s 25mm Imperial marines, but haven\'t
bought them for that reason. I also know of the cardboard figures, but I\'d
prefer something 3-D.

Can\'t you use some sort of delete key? This is NOT a flame, I often make typing
errors, but I can correct them if I spot them. I\'m just wondering if some
people have genuine reasons for not being able to do so.

Next, a more Traveller-based question. Given all the current fears about what a
nuclear war would do (e.g. nuclear winter), could a naval force, e.g. a battle
squadron, effectively destroy a planet by using a few salvoes of nuclear
missiles? If so, is this accounted for in any account of the Frontier Wars or
any other wars? Is it provided for in any rules?

Hello, hello...

Why don\'t the Scouts in the Field have rank?  I would think that as a
quasi-military arm of the Imperial government, that they would have an internal
structure of ranks and responsibilities.  (The US Coast Guard is under the
Dept. of Transportation, at least in peacetime, and they have a military-style
structure...)

Before I make a "house rule" that changes this, can anybody make a good case
for IISS personnel not having some form of field rank?

Cosmos #5  in a series of house rules for a Trav based variant.

__________________________________________________________________________


SKILL IMPROVEMENT for Cosmos.

1.  The player elects a skill that each character is studying.  During the
    study period (usually determined by the tech level and invironment) the
    character has the new skill at LEVEL-0.  To learn a skill the PC must have
    the means at hand.  These could be LIBRARY programs, SIMULATOR programs,
    carefully designated practice steps or direct guidence with another 
    character with INSTRUCTION and the skill being studied.
    Common sense comes into play here.  You can\'t study GUNNER stranded
    on an low tech level planet but you certainly could study
    STREETWISE or SURVIVAL.  MAGIC and PSI are virtually impossible
    to learn without a defacto instructor (real, ancient ritual or
    otherwise).  NOTHINGNESS also has a special learning technique
    (see its skill description).

2.  The player can elect to improve an existing skill level INSTEAD
    of learning a new one.

3.  Normally the character only studies ONE skill at a time (as mentioned in
    1.), however MAGIC, PSI and NOTHINGNESS can be studied while
    another mundane skill is being studied due to their unusual
    properties.

4.  Normally the tech level will determine the study period:

       Tech level 0-2	  180 days
       Tech level 3-10	  90 days
       Tech level 11-18	  45 days
       Tech level 19-26	  30 days
       Tech level 27-31   15 days

    The dice roll to determine if the character increases the skill:
    
        7[+(new skill level)-(number times attempted and failed)-
          (skill use dice modifier)-(instructors level dice modifier)-(INT
          dice modifier)-(EDU dice modifier)]+

    on 2Dice

    The greater "new skill level" the more difficult the roll is.  The other
    dice modifiers make the roll easier.

    The skill level is a number between 1 and n.  In theory n is
    infinite but in practice is limited by the tech level and EDU
    level of the society in question.  The number of times attempted
    is recorded on the character sheet for each character by the player for
    each failure at a skill.  Thus the chance to increase a skill
    level decreases each study period.  The skill use dice modifier is the
    number of time the character used the skill DURING the study period.
    It is limited to THREE.  Usages above 3 are not counted as dice modifiers.
    The instructors level dice modifier counts if the character was studying
    with an instructor with INSTRUCT skill AND the skill the character is 
    studying.   The instructors level dice modifier is applied only if the
    INSTRUCT skill roll is made.  The normal difficulty procedure applies to
    the instructor rolling their skill.  The INT dice modifier is based on
    the characters INT:

         2-5 = -1; 6-9 = 0; A-D = +1; E-(E+3) = +2; for each 3 pts >
         (E+3) = +1

    The EDU dice modifier is based on the characters EDU:

         2-5 = -1; 6-B = 0; C-E = +1; F-(F+3) = +2; for each 3 pts >
         (F+3) = +1

5.  Skill levels run:   ...-2,-1,<null>,0,1,2,3,4,5,6...

6.  If the player rolls a 2 when trying to increase the characters skill level
    it is ALWAYS a failure.  The player subsequently tries to roll the
    current skill level.  If that fails then the character goes DOWN a level.
    If the current skill level is zero then the character has the skill at
    a negative level and has a psychological block against learning
    that particular skill.  If the character is successfully \'cured\' by
    another with PSYCH (or possibly SOC SCI) then the level returns
    to zero NOT <null>.  A character with a negative skill cannot substitute
    a save vrs. one the characters characteristics for zero level.

7.  For failures to count for increasing a skill level the studying
    of that skill does not have to be consecutive.  This means that
    ORATORY-2 can be studied then GROUND CAR-1 and then ORATORY-2 again
    and have the failures count.

8.  Successful usages of the skill ONLY count while the character is studying
    it.

9.  Skills can also be learned while trying to increase EDU (see
    increasing character characteristics).

    Discussion:  The ability to learn, how fast one can learn, how much
    information is available to a given society and how fast one can get
    to it all determines the TECH LEVEL for that society.
    In addition to these components the INT of species may have been
    increased via bioengineering and their may be a symbiotic relationship
    between the species and its machine systems.  The common existence
    of PSI would have an enormous impact on learning.  All these components
    are taken into account when designing the semantic network for the
    species skills and HOW FAST they can learn them.  Notice here that
    League Cosmos must know a lot more about the learning process ITSELF
    In League Cosmos without a human instructor
    assuming you had a small computer with a library program and a few
    subconscious programming tapes if you knew little about MATH you
    could learn the basics of algebra and calculus in as little as 45
    days.  Tech level 11 is as a normalization point for obvious
    reasons.  In tech level 10 not only would the semantic network of
    skills for the same species change somewhat but it would take you
    longer to learn skills.  

CHARACTER CHARACTERISTIC IMPROVEMENT for Cosmos

1.  Instead of a skill the character can elect to improve STR, DEX or END.
    This comes about through rigidly controlled diet, programs for body
    building and graceful movement, computer aided learning and an
    expected minimum amount of medical supervision.  The time required
    is the same as skills.  At the end of the training period a character
    characteristic improvement roll is made:

    (3Dice - current character characteristic) (+ (number of fails) +
      instructor skill))-  

    on 3Dice.

2. Unlike the skills, for the number of fails to apply to the character
   characteristic increase, the training periods MUST be consecutive.

3. Alternatively the player can choose to improve STR, DEX or END
   by direct intervention of another character with MEDICAL skill.  The
   difficulty of the roll is commensurate with new character characteristics:

    8 (+ new character characteristic - character medical skill level)+

   The greater the characteristic the more difficult the roll.   The greater
   the skill of the medical system the easier the roll.

4. A player can elect to try to increase a characters INT.  When this
   attempt is made NOTHING ELSE can be done while the MEDICAL type
   works on the character.  Increasing the brain power is dangerous and
   should not be taken lightly.  Failures can cause unpredictable
   results and fumbles are disastrous, usually removing the character from
   play.  The MEDICAL difficulty roll:is:

    10 (+ new character INT - character medical skill level)+

   The greater the INT the more difficult the roll.   The greater
   the skill of the medical system the easier the roll.

   The minimum time envolved is 45 days at a tech level 12 medical center.

5.  A player can elect to increase the characters EDU.  To do this the 
    character must enroll in one of many League or planet run schools.  The
    total amount of actual time in school must be a 180 actual day
    period (at tech level 12).  Going half time would double the amount of real
    time.
    The character must be in routine contact with the instructors so normally
    EDU CANNOT be increased on a starship.  While in school the character
    is allowed (tech level - 4) skill increase rolls in addition to the EDU
    increase roll:

   8 (+ new character EDU - character instructor skill level - number fails)+

   on 3Dice

   The greater the EDU the more difficult the roll.   The greater
   the skill of the instructor system the easier the roll.  The number of fails
   in this case DO NOT have to be consecutive and each failure makes the roll
   easier.

   Also cultural, economic and environmental factors can effect the basis for
   EDU.

6. Increasing or decreasing a characters SOC depends on what the character
   does in the game (and on the subjectivity of the game master).

7. Increasing or decreasing APP is trivial.  The medical cost is payed.

8. Increasing PSI in a character is a mystery.

9. Increasing FOR is described in Cosmos magic (force science).

In the latest issue of _Challenge_, there is a "courier" senario, in which a
number of background/flavor elements are included.  One of these mentions that
Lucan has ordered his admirals not to surrender any High Population worlds.

There is a later mention of an admiral ordering the nuclear bobmardment of a
world he was about to lose to advancing forces, in order to change the world\'s
status so that it was *no longer* a High Population world...  He is awarded the
"Starburst for Extreme Heroism" by Lucan.   (*Nice* people!)

As an aside, I never received any answers to my earlier question:
Is anyone else using the GDW "Shattered Imperium" campaign background?

Martian Metals, which burned down in 1982 or 83 and the remnants of
which are now part of FASA, made a whole series of Traveller figures
from Aslan to Zhodani. You might try some of the more obscure distributors
in the business (notably Lou Zohichi (or however you spell that)),but
expect to pay a good buck.

As far as nuclear missiles go, a few sources come to mind: !.  Special
Supplement 2, published in Journal 18(?) should help explain that.
Striker, if you can get a copy, goes into extensive detail on the
subject of interfacing ground and ship combat.  Striker is out of print,
but last I heard GDW still has some copies around the warehouse but no
boxes for them.  They were willing to sell them last I heard.  Write
them for details.

3. See The Referee\'s Companion for more info.


As I don\'t have access to these materials as I type, I\'m not certain
about the above, and as Mike said, graduate studies don\'t allow much
time for Traveller any more.  God knows if I\'ll ever get to finishing,
if ever.  Sigh.

Currently I don\'t think anyone is actively manufactureing 15mm space
figures.  The five lines I know of are all out of production.  The lines
are:
		Citadel
		Grenadier
		Laserburn
		Martian Metals		
		Star????

The best Traveller figures were the Citadel ones (this was the licensed
line for England).  It had limited availability in this country after
Martian Metals burned and were withdrawn from production due to the American
license company (which never actually produced figures).  They produced
packs of 20 different figures each of: Adventurers, Military (you could also
get low, mid and high tech packs), Ship\'s Crew, Aliens (you could also get
Aslan, Droyne and Vargyr packs).  Figures were very well animated and
detailed.  These were actually produced in Canada by RAFM and so even after
they were withdrawn from sale here they were available without too much effort.
Grenadier figures while not specificially for Traveller made a number of usable
figures (including my nefarious Thought Police with police van).
Laserburn was again not for Traveller, but made numerous useful figures.  I use
a number of these for my vehicle crews and adventurers.  The figure were
also animated, but may of the figures were just too odd.
Martian Metals were the worst line quality wise.  Most of their figures looked
to me like squashed bugs.  The typical pose was standing arms straight out to
the side.  Nevertheless they had some useful figures.  They were the only ones
to produce Kirur and Zhodani figures.  They also made an "Alien" and Darth
Vader figure.  They had some decent robots.
The last line I only saw once and can\'t remember the whole name.  It had good
figures, but they were a bit large.  Also the line was pretty limited only a
few figures (maybe 20).
Other sources of figures that we have used include WWII 15mm figures painted
to look space age and there was a 25mm line that produced a good 15mm
lizardman (Frank Chadwick\'s infamous Newt Company).

Friday marked the second anniversary of the Traveller Mailing List.  Two
years ago I asked rec.games.frp if such an idea raised any interest, and
now we\'re over 150 members strong, with the following confirmed
international membership counts: 7 in Canada, 2 in Denmark, 1 in the
Netherlands, 4 in Sweden, and 5 in the UK (about 15% of the list
membership).  We have at least 4 people on this list which have
published Traveller materials, and at least one which has run a PBEM
Traveller game.

List contributions by month (yes, the graph is sideways):

	Note: The list mailing software was broken Jan \'89 through Feb
	\'89.  Jun \'89 is currently at about 18 messages, so it looks
	like things have mostly calmed down.

Archives:
	Kbytes: 1717 (1140 this year)
	Number of messages: 400 (259 this year)
	Number of full bundles: 38 (26 this year)
	Average message size: 4 Kbytes
	Average # messages/week: 7 (up from 3 the previous year)

The above shows that list traffic has increased by a factor of ~2 over
the previous year.  Although messages have remained the same size, we
are getting twice as many of them.

We\'ve had quite a loss of old listees (~30-40) in the past year, which
has been compensated by about 60 new listees, so I think the membership
is fairly stable at around 150 members.  Reasons for loss included
computer account termination (~25%), lack of interest (~25%), or broken
mail addresses (~50%).

During the past year we\'ve had problems with duplicated mail and the
hp.com server failure, both of which have required signifigant efforts
to track down.

I\'ve implemented a dual distribution path for list members in the past
year.  Listees can now choose between "instant" message delivery, or
twice-weekly "digest" delivery.  I\'ve added software that makes it
easier for me to manage the list, particularly in answering standard
questions (archive requests, and the new listee package).  I\'ve also
added "archive packages" that contain messages which pertain to specific
topics (MT Errata, Software, and Ship Designs).  If you\'d like a copy of
the archive contents listing, or change your delivery format, please let
me know.

My friends at Computer Network Services here at Tek have recently put
the company mail server (tektronix.tek.com) on the Internet, with a
leased line connection to CSNET.  This has reduced propagation delay for
mail reaching you from 1-6 hours down to 1-10 minutes!

THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES in the next couple months FOR ADDRESSING MAIL
TO REACH ME AND THE LIST DISTRIBUTION SOFTWARE.  Keep a watch out for
the change, which I will announce as it happens.

If you can think of any way to make this list better, I\'d like to hear
your suggestions (even if they are "be more prompt!", or "stop sending
this silly anniversary drivel").

Thanks everybody for being a part of this list.  It\'s your contributions
that have made this list valuable.  Keep up the excellent quality of
this last year\'s contributions, and I\'ll try to keep the list
functional.

You don\'t need any nukes. Just a few starships or system defense boats. dock
them to a small asteroid (say a chunk of nickel iron a couple of kilometers
across). Use their power plants to nudge it into an orbit that will hit the
planet. Preferably in an ocean if the planet is reasonably earthlike.

Can you say "Dinosaur killer"? For that matter since the asteroid is only
going to hit at 10-15 km/sec and the impact energy depends on the *square*
of the velocity, maybe throwing a smaller asteroid at a higher speed would
be better. 6 G for a few days will give a velocity in the *thousands* of 
km/sec! (5e3 km/sec day 1, 10e3 day 2, etc...) At these speeds, who needs
a warhead? Anything short of anti-matter won\'t even affect the outcome!

If anyone is interested, I\'ll dig out the figures from an old article
on giant meteor strikes and convert the data to ship impacts on planets.

I\'ve thought along similar lines as well. Find a small asteroid (say, a few
100\'s of tonnes). Attach a power plant, manoeuvre drive and control system to
it. Move it out of orbit, to a suitable distance, and let it head for the
target world for 4 weeks at 1G (keep the drives cheap, simple and expendable).
Resulting velocity = 10 x 4 x 7 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 0.24e8 m/sec. I\'ll let
someone else add in any relativistic calculations. But the gear needed could be
stuffed into an empty 50 tonne weapon bay on a cruiser.

I think you would be better off using the Bulk Cargo carrior in Fighting ships.
That way you could get that sucker going a good speed.  You then jump the ship
and meteor into the correct star system.  This way, you can be out of the
system before anyone even sees the meteor comming.  You simply cut the jump
cables once you enter the system.  Or if you have time, remove them for reuse.
You don\'t have to worry about sticking around and getting shot at while you
take the asteroid up to speed.  You do that in an already occupied parsect.
Admittedly, it is a more expensive way to enter the feild, but then again,
you can reuse the ship.  You also don\'t have to worry about the enemy coming
and taking over the asteroid while the engines are still emplaced.  Then
turning it to s new and safe trajectory.

The Problem with meteors is that they are very visible, and easily disrupted by
sufficient TL weapons, whereas a missle could easily have stealth capabilities

Someone just told me that Laserburn is still in business. He
is a miniatures nut, so I consider his info reliable.

As for asteroids as planet-killers, see Adventure 12,
Secret of the Ancients. Grandfather used asteroids which
were accelerated to near-light speeds through his portals
and then smashed into planets/. The impact then shattered them,
and created some new asteroid belts. This process was
Grandfather\'s ultimate weapon with which he fought his
Final War against his children, wiping all of them out.

How about that Lucan, eh? What a kooky guy.

Sorry, but a small asteriod/large meteor is *not* very visible. The only way
to detect it is with active sensors as it won\'t have any emissions worth 
mentioning. You might say it is naturally stealthy. After all, it is just
a falling rock. Nothing special about it except the fact that its orbit
intersects that target\'s orbit at the time the target is there.

And just what TL weapon can *destroy* a chunk of nickel-iron a mile or
two in diameter? Breaking it up into pieces makes the problem *worse*
not better. You have to completely destroy it or deflect its course.
If you "break" it, the pieces will deliver just as much impact energy,
and more of it will wind up in the atmosphere (and thus mess up your
climate).

If we go for near-lightspeed projectiles, you won\'t be able to detect
them in time to stop them. After all, at .9c, something a billion miles
away will arrive less than 7 seconds after any possible detector message!
A billion miles is roughly the diameter of Jupiter\'s orbit. And at .9c
a projectile a few *meters* in diameter would be a world killer.

I can\'t see any practical defense. Luckily .9c is not easily attainable
even at high tech levels. But this type of overgrown kinetic-kill weapon
is a possible means of gravely unbalancing the balance of power.

In our group this is refered to as the Drop the Rock problem (after the
entertaining section of the C&S rules by that name.)  The only solution
we have come up with is that in a potentially hostile enviornment
(terrorists have access to starships, engines can accellerate at 1+G
for months) a system must maintain draconian control over all objects within
a large radius of its inhabited planets.

That means active scanning; passive scanning for energy emitted by
small objects impacting the near-lightspeed asteroid; etc.  The
radius must be large enough that the society can apply a large delta
V to the object in question, for example by partical beam, or kinetic
weapon of their own (remember the velocities roughly add in a colision.)

All together though its an arguement against the existance of life on planets
or other objects that can not dodge at least a few miles give a short notice.

	Uhmmm... let me get this straight... a tiny cylinder of sophisticated
electronics can be "hardened" more than a huge lump of nickel-iron??
 
	Regardless, if the TL is high enough that the one side might have
weapons with enough brute force to virtually disintegrate the meteor (and
it would have to do so to prevent any damage.  Perhaps there would be less
direct damage from a shattered meteor, but the amount would still be 
considerable) then the other side would have sufficient resources to move
a truly massive meteor, making it just as difficult to destroy/divert as
the smaller meteor at lower TL.  
 
	Heck, if things are that high level, they could just hook up some
sort of stealth system to the meteor, or perhaps a black globe (think now,
with an entire meteor (and truly massive meteor at that) to act as a heat
sink, the black globe could absorb a heckuva lot of damage, and even before
that, the globe would enable the meteor to get much closer before detection.
Also, if the meteor is roughly spherical, and the globe is calibrated so
the outer edge is only a few feet out from the surface, it would be almost
impossible for enemy ship to land on the meteor.
 
	Of course, by that time you might as well get creative with your
TL18 devices, like linking a teleportation gate to the heart of a star,
and hooking the "output" end to a planet\'s atmosphere, or perhaps even
hooking several stars together to accelerate the aging process and cause
a spontaneous nova.  If that\'s too esoteric for your tastes, simply put
together a VERY powerful gravity generator (the size of the deathstar,
perhaps) able to survive solar temperature for a short (or even not so
short) length of time, then drop it into a star and turn on the gravity.
Bingo, instant disruption of the star\'s structure, resulting in something
similar enough to a nova to severely screw up the other side\'s control of 
a system... not that anybody would WANT the system after this has been done...

Actually, they are reasonably strong infrared sources.  For example, the
recent NASA IRAS (Infrared Astronomy Satellite) survey managed to detected
several comets in the outer solar system (i.e., where they are just icy
bodies of roughly kilometer size and have not developed a coma or tail)
using technology which is well behind our current state of the art (since
it had to be frozen years in advance of the launch).

Also, it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that systems with advanced TL
worlds will employ active sensors to monitor all local traffic and use
computers to flag any objects on non-ballistic trajectories 
(i.e., accelerating) or with orbits which will carry them into high traffic
areas.

You are correct that breaking it up immediately outside the atmosphere will
do little, if any, good.  However, any weapon that breaks it up reasonably
violently (i.e., explosively) at a considerable distance will impart 
sufficient transverse velocity to nearly all of the fragments so as to
make them miss the target entirely.  The basic point is that planets are
quite small objects on interplanetary scales and very easy to miss.  For
example, imparting a transverse velocity of only 1 km/s to an object
previously moving toward the center of the Earth as it crosses the Moon\'s
orbit (very close!) is about sufficient to cause it to miss entirely;
further away, even smaller deflection velocities will suffice.  For
basicly the same reasons, deflection of the whole incoming object is far
easier (less energetically demanding) than putting it on a collision
course in the first place.

First of all, I make it to be more like 10 minutes than 7 seconds, but
in any case, you are now talking about a fundamentally different kind
of weapon.  Previously, we were discussing a weapon which derived its
energy primarily from its own mass and orbital velocities (i.e., basicly
the star\'s gravitational field) with the drive only supplying the
nudges needed to aim it at the target.  However, a .9c kinetic weapon
must derive nearly all of its energy from the drive itself which is
a very different situation.  If we control that much energy, there
will be many different ways to use it destructively.  For example, we can
use the drive itself (plus perhaps some stealth technology) as a missle.
The mass may be less but the velocity will be correspondingly increased
to deliver the same (actually more in the most reasonable case in which
the drive delivers a fixed thrust) kinetic energy.  Alternately, we
might be able to convert the drive\'s energy into an explosive form and
simply use it as a bomb.  Anyway, it is a whole different problem.

Cosmos 6; A continuing list of house rules of the Cosmos variant Trav
system.

- ----  S K I L L S ---- L I S T ----

Note: 

Skills with an EDU component are limited and modified by Tech Level.

Common Trav derived notation is used; 9+ means "greater than 9".
9- means "less than 9".  "INT 9+ = +1"  means "if INT is greater than
9 then 1 extra point is added".

_________________________________________________________________________

ACTING.
    Skill associations: @ ACTING-1  PC gains ORATORY-0, @ ACTING-2 character
    must have ORATORY-1.
    Adv Mods: SOC B(11)+ = +1, INT 9+ = +1, for each 5 pts > 9 = +1;

PC is generally effective in using application generators and session
moderators to solve problems.  Program = COMP + <other skill>.  At levels
2-3 PC knows details of how the system interconnects below the dialog
level (at our tech level it is roughly equivalent to skills in database,
operating systems, real time, and distributed systems).  At levels 4 and
above the PC can objectively control the intelligence of the machine
(border line alien life form).  The PC will have a knowledge of
interconnectiveness of logical genetic encoding primitives, condensed
natural selection of strong vrs. weak gencodprim combinations, parallel
symbolic interaction of machine thinking processes (at our tech level
approximating our early attempts of artificial stupidity).  In League
Cosmos society is close to have created machines that are alien life forms.

student studying a skill under that instructor of increasing their ability
in the skill.  The GM will apply the level of INSTR to the algorithm to
increase PC skills (when successfully used by the instructor).  The
instructor can only teach skills known.  The GM might put restrictions on
an instructor teaching INSTR (perhaps a long time restriction).  The skill
is not limited by tech level.  It has a strong association to culture.

JACK OF ALL TRADES.
    Skill associations: infinite.
    Subskills: infinite.
    Adv Mods: vbl (depending on skill).
    Disadv Mods: vbl (depending on skill).
J O T is the roleplayers delight.  It allows the player to give the character
obscure and archaic skills at little skill point cost.  All J O T skills
are at level-0.  The number of skills depends on the J O T level:
J O T-0 choose 6 skills, J O T-1 add 6 skills (12 total), J O T-2 and -3
add 3 skills, for each level > 3 add 2 skills.  J O T is the result of
a move towards generalization in League society.  There are plenty of
charcters  running around that consider themselves to be the learned 
generalist.  There are a few restrictions on J O T skills.  The skill must be
learned somewhere, i.e., MAGIC-0 cannot be chosen as a J O T skill unless its
discovered (very difficult) or learned.  Specialized but related J O T
skills count as a unit each.  Example: LOW PASSAGE ENGINEER and ENGINEER
count as two skills.  Some J O T skills that have been invented so far:
DISC JOCKEY-0, SPACEPORT ART-0, COMPUTER AIDED SEX-0.  J O T has constant
tech level restrictions and is (variably) associated culture.

JUMPING.

    Skill associations: JUMP is considered as subskill of ATHLET.
    Adv Mods: STR A(10)+ = +1, for each 4 pts > A = +1, DEX A(10)+ = +1,
    for each 4 pts > A = +1.

It is not limited by tech level.  It is weakly associated to culture.

LAW.
    Subskills:  LAW is divided by domain into SPACE, PLANETARY and XENO LAW
    and by function, say CREDIT LAW, LEGAL SEMANTICS, TAX LAW, CHURCH LAW,
    ARCHAIC COMMON LAW, etc.
    Skill associations: @ LAW 2 gain ADMIN-0, @ LAW 1 must have ADMIN-1.
    Adv Mods: INT C(12)+ = +1, for each 4 pts > C = +1, EDU A(10)+ = +1, for

    Disadv Mods: INT 6- = -1, EDU 7- =-1, EDU 4- = -2.
In League SPACE LAW is backed by an assembly of all planetary subscribers
that is held every 400 20 hour cycles in our chronometry. There are
substantial economic advantages in cooperating with the League law makers
so far planet subs rarely fall out of line.  How a planetary government
functions and how its associated legal system functions can vary, thus
the subskill PLANETARY LAW.  XENO LAW is a whole \'nother game.  
LAW is strongly associated to culture and not limited by tech level.

LEADER.
    Adv Mods: APP C(12)+ = +1
    Disadv Mods: none.
This skill enables the character to lead others in combat and noncombat
situations.  In combat situations the skill can reduce the chance
of enemy surprise.  APP as a advantage mod is tentative and culturelly
dependent.  The skill is strongly associated to culture and is not limited
by tech level.

	      for each 4 pts > D = +1.
    Disadv Mods: INT 6- = -1, DEX 6- = -1.
Typically this skill is used with SECURITY SYSTEMS, but only deals with 
arming and disarming electromechanical lock devices.  The skill is moderately
associated to culture.  It is not limited by tech level.  The skill does not
exist at tech level 0.

MAGIC (FORCE 
    Subskills: infinite.
    Adv Mods: INT, FOR vbl.
    Disadv Mods: INT, FOR vbl.
This skill allows the medium to channel this \'energy\' in the COSMOS
space-time continuum to do strange and sometimes awesome things.  The
effect ranges from MAGIC-0 where the medium is able to do the basic
manipulations of force on their person, to MAGIC-5+ where the medium
is able to recombine time, energy and matter.  The basic throw is made
as in all other skills.  If the medium does not fumble, they will get so
much stuff to put in the force transformation.  See COSMOS MAGIC (FORCE
SCIENCE) writeup for further details.  The skill is variably associated to
culture and variably limited by tech level.

MARTIAL ARTS.

    The specialties of the social scientist are more closely
associated than those of the physical scientist.  The ANTHRO expert
is concerned (for purposes of analysis) with a society in "stasis" and
attempts to study its technology, small-to-large group behavior,
prevalent mythologies, family structures, ritualization processes.
The ANTHRO expert of League would be a combination of the physical
and cultural anthropologist plus the sociologist of our 20th cent.
The SOC DYN expert is more concerned with defining what and what will
not happen in the future of a given society if certain things are or
are not done.  There is not past, present or future to be studied only
the sum total multicausal relationships of a given society as it
evolves through its time-space continuum.  SOC DYN experts are usually
disliked by planetary governments (they have been known to argue for
the decrease in government power one year and for its increase the
next to everyones frustration!), and are usually radicals of some kind
or planetary subversives.  In the 20th cent social
philosophers of every persuation can be considered the forerunner of
the SOC DYN expert.  HIST experts are capable of finding obscure
details on the societies past.  They can also time-date things very
accurately given the correct information.  League HIST experts are
not unlike our own.  The ECON BEHAV specialist is knowledgeable in
in the distribution of either mental or physical "scarce things"
and what their effect on the behavior/perception of people of
a known society ("the masses").  The ECON BEHAV specialist is not
unlike our present day economist, but with a considerably broader view
of what "economics" is.  The POLIT ECON specialist is knowledgeable
on how the sum total of mental/physical work output by a given
society is controlled and used by that society.  Typically the
POLIT ECON specialist is knowledgeable in discovering the "true"
mechanisms of economic social control.  Political economists of
the 20th cent are are represented by doctrinaire and nondoctrinaire
schools of thought as to how the state, individual and society
relate to economies.  The PSYCH specialist is able to identify
individual symbolic identification, individual mythology and logic
building mechanisms, they will be able to recognize the persons
nonconscious mental processes.  The PSYCH specialist can build
a paradigm of characters psychological processes ("parent-child-other",
"analyzer-supporter-controller-promoter matrix", ect.).  The PSYCH
specialist is useful in removing learning blocks incurred by characters
(negative skill levels).  If the descriptions seem hard to
differentiate its because its true.  The SOC SCI subskills tend
to overlap.  This skill is strongly assoiciated to the culture and it
is limited by the tech level.

XENO <species specific skill>.
Subskills: Species specific.
Skill associations: species skill specific.
     There are many possible XENO skills.  The more obvious are XENO
PSYCHOLOGY (including intelligent machines as an alien species), XENO
LINGUISTICS, even XENO ENGINEERING.  We assume for game purposes that
the alien species operates in the same time-space-energy continuum that
we do so the laws of physics should be the same.  Thus XENO PHYSICS
would be the same as PHYSICS.  However the alien may learn it in a
considerably different way.  There will be skills that one species can
easily understand  but never use because of a different biological
system (like FLY, PERCEPTION NIGHT VISION, PERCEPTION SMELL).  Then
there may be alien skills that have no equivalent in the home culture
at all.

	HI, 
	   I just joined this mailing list. When I was looking
through the list of the old messages. I saw the MegaTraveller
Errta listed. Is that the offical copy from GDW/Digest? If not,
I got a copy from Joe Fugate Sr/Traveller\'s Digest, and I 
would be happy to post it.

	  Another thing, Digest Group is planning to release
MegaTraveller Aliens Source Book #1 this coming fall. Stay tune for 
more information.

You guys are comparing apples and oranges...

My point is that a mostly plastic basketball sized nuke drifting toward a
planet is going to be a hell of a lot harder to detect then a mile?  football
field? sized meteor, and a lot harder to hit.

Now, all other things being equal, the higher the velocity/accel the easier it
is to detect and the harder it is to deflect.  Assume an equivelent TL/effort
for defense.  If you want to start adding fancy TL equipment to the weapon, all
things being equal, the nuke still comes out ahead.  

At some point, you might as well be building ships.  The scale of operations
some of you are talking about, is an entire war.  Replace that operation with a
mass production of a thousand nukes, and see what comes out ahead.  Of course
at sufficient TL/effort the PBN becomes a sitting duck, and some of the more
exotic weapons mentioned come into play, but certainly not below TL 15.

[Are the TML MT Errata genuine GDW items?]

I believe so, it is from Delphi and was placed there by Group Digest,
which has been ceded ultimate rules control power by GDW, and submitted
to this list by Mike Rossow.  It comes in two sets, dated 4/1/88 and
10/1/88.  Ask me for packages MT1 and MT2 if you want copies of it.
Mac, I\'d be happy if you sent me the ones you have, and I\'ll compare
them to the ones I have, and if they\'re different I\'ll post the new
ones to the list.

[MT Aliens Source Book #1 coming this fall from Digest Group]

They\'re also past due on releasing the World Builder\'s book and another
which are the successors to Grand Census and Grand Survey.  Also GDW has
a Robots book for MegaTraveller due in November (heard this all at my
gaming shop).

Hello out there in that great electronic sea we call Usenet...

(Melodramatic, but it has a nice ring to it.)
 
I\'ve heard from a few different sources that one of the Traveller 2300
books had some optional rules for Cyberpunk genre roleplaying.

(Just leaping right into it, aren\'t you?)

I\'ve also heard that these rules, in general, suck.  Unfortunately,
that\'s ALL I\'ve heard.  How about some input from somebody out there
who has a copy?

(Which means he\'s too cheap to go out and buy one for himself.)

I\'m kind of curious to see how well Traveller and Cyberpunk would
mix.  I\'ve always wanted to do something like this, since the issue
of the TASJ which had computer chip implants in the Ship\'s Locker.
I\'ve also encouraged my present Cyberpunk GM to adopt a different
set of rules (Traveller, Twilight 2000, or possibly GURPS) for combat,
vehicles, etc., because the Cyberpunk rules are sadly lacking in that
area.  Hopefully he\'ll make a decision one of these days...
 
(Hopefully you\'ll stop bugging him one of these days.)
 
Till next time...

(Me too...)

I\'d like to thank everyone for the rousing welcome I\'ve received. I was rather 
hoping to sneak in the back door and just stand quietly for a while, but it 
seems that I\'ll have no such luck. (Ah, fame.  |-> )

To answer some questions:

1. I have nothing to add to the miniatures discussion; I don\'t use them, 
myself.

2. When I dash off fast letters on the VMS mail system, the text is written to 
memory one line at a time. If I notice a typo on a previous line, there\'s no
way to undo the error. For longer messages (like this one), I use a text 
editor like any other normal humanoid.

3. I will naturally inform the List if and when I get my grubby paws on the 
full Imperial Atlas; and yes, I do run the Shattered Imperium stuff for my 
campaign. (I, like just about everyone else, had an IRIS-like organization 
screwing up game balance in my campaign LONG before the CHALLENGE articles.
|-> )

4. On wholesale nuclear devastation: doesn\'t anyone remember what happened to 
Ganulph?

5. To those of you who saw the Near Miss story on rec.games.frp, hold your 
noses... I\'m going to rerun it for the benefit of those who hadn\'t seen it 
before. It\'s a trial draft for a book I hope to submit to Digest Group later 
this year. I\'m open to suggestions on it; this is a more recent draft than the 
one that ran in the newsgroup, and it\'ll be revised several more times before
the Digest Group editorial staff sees it.

And now a question to the Group in general: how popular are the alien races 
for PCs in your campaigns, and which ones do people prefer? I\'m partial to 
Vargr, myself, and every now and then I get the feeling that I\'m the only one 
in the Orion Arm who runs them as anything other than greedy little cowards.
I have a friend who loves Hivers; he took naturally to the idea of 
manipulation. (Heeyucko.) And is anyone running Aslan for anything other than 
swift and merciless death?

hoping to hear from y\'all soon....

 adventures that ran at GenCons from 1984 to 1989. Hope you all like it.)


		MEET NEAR MISS: An introduction of sorts


	From MUSICA GALACTICA, the 104-1113 "Troubadors of Space" issue:

	"[...] Few of the touring music/vid/drama troupes, however, carry
quite the same impact as Near Miss, a band which until recently confined its
touring to the sectors Behind the Claw, but who recently crossed the Corridor
into the Imperium proper in an attempt to reach a wider audience. Near Miss
stands apart from groups like Albino Dream, Corpseshriek, Veedback, and
Orgasmic Plateau in so many ways, it is almost not worthwhile to mention them 
in the same article as the others; but that, being an inexcusable insult in 
the face of their talents, is not permissible either, so we must apologize to 
the Shriekers and Veedheads and step into a cleaner, more polished spotlight 
for a while.
	"Most of the troubador bands have a small, tight lineup, with Albino
Dream\'s six members considered quite a large number. They stick exclusively 
to a set musical style, and vary from it only slowly and with great care so as 
not to chance losing their vast and potentially fickle audiences. And, due to 
the uniquely human love of such art forms, they tend to be all human in makeup 
and to attract a predominantly human audience. Near Miss violates every one of 
these hard and fast rules in its tenure as a frighteningly eclectic eight-piece 
ensemble of humans and nonhumans alike. Nobody can tell precisely what they\'ll 
play next, and in their home territory they are as much beloved of Vargr and 
Aslan audiences as they are of human crowds. There are few, if any, automated 
sequences in their music, and they pride themselves on the total spontaneity 
of live performance, succeeding or failing on their own merits from night to 
night and leaving nothing to the cold clutches of the mechanized musician. The 
playlist for a Near Miss concert can range from Vargr moonhowls to Aslan fury
marches to Solomani rock and roll to Vilani shidagga, and all are played with 
an irreverent enthusiasm that\'s as infectious as it is disarming. While 
they\'ve not yet begun to attract the huge crowds that flock to Veedback shows, 
they nevertheless have a loyal following on many worlds, ranging in age from 
nine to ninety and in musical taste from ancient classical to modern
slashnoise. And perhaps most bizarre of all is their lifestyle: rather than
the usual one-night-to-a-groupie flings, they live sedately in an almost
familial closeness, and each of them is happily married...to another band
member(!). 
	"Clearly, this band stands out as unusual in the troubador genre; 
their music polished, their personal lives quiet, their style truly unique."

*****

>From the private archives of the above article\'s writer: also dated 104-1113

	"I was lucky enough to secure an interview with the band just after a 
successful series of concerts on Guranthu, while they awaited fueling for 
their tour ship, the Peggisu. They were oddly reticent about some questions, 
effusive about others, and generally seemed willing only to add to the sense 
of mystery that surrounds them. While their real names are a matter of record, 
they prefer their stage nicknames when dealing with the press, so that\'s what 
I agreed to use here. 
	"Captain Crisis, or CC as he likes to be called, is the band\'s leader 
and front man, playing keyboards in the old Solomani style and lending the 
band its best-known voice. His wife, known as Windy, plays various wind 
instruments as well as the Terran sixwire ghitar. Although she\'d normally be
considered quite old for a rock goddess, she carries herself like a teenager,
acting younger in some ways than Torch, the young vidtech whose light shows
and vids form an integral part of the show. Torch is actually the youngest
member of the band, barely half the age of her husband Docshock, who handles
the live sound for the group\'s concerts as well as producing their albums. The
other four members of the band are the nonhumans: two Aslan and two Vargr,
both pairs about as uncharacteristic of their races as one could imagine. Hug,
the huge furydrummer, resembles a stuffed tiger toy more than a fierce Aslan
warrior in his demeanor, and his lady Fuse seems to grant him a good deal more
free rein than most Aslan wives. As for the Vargr, well, Tinker and Motormutt
appear to be fighting to some degree or another virtually all the time,
creating a tension that they carry on stage in their fierce duels on badaan
and suerzkfuerrghz. The flareups added to the high sense of nervousness in the
band\'s demeanor at what would normally be a routine interview.... 

MUSICA GALACTICA: "Thanks very much for granting this interview."

[Various polite noises of assent; Motormutt yawns widely and is cuffed on
the ear by Tinker, who begins to snarl at him in some Vargr dialect, perhaps
Arrghoun or Gvegh. The argument carries on in the background of the first few
minutes of the interview.]

CC: "Don\'t mind them. Tinker\'s angry \'cause Motormutt stepped on her solo 
tonight. She\'s real touchy about that; badaan players don\'t solo often."

MG: "It seems that you make it a point to give everyone plenty of room...."

CC: "You have to, with this bunch. Have you ever awakened with somebody\'s 
wounded artistic sensibilities sticking out from between your shoulder bl-- 
OW!" [There is a pause. CC glares at Windy, who glares back.] Sorry. My bad 
knee\'s acting up. As I was saying, this bunch is too damned dangerous for me 
to stiff out of a solo--OW! DAMN IT!" [Windy\'s glare is now hot enough to melt 
a jump coil. CC looks at her and continues, a bit more subdued.] Sorry. What I 
mean is..." [he looks at Windy, who now appears to be ignoring him]"...is 
that we have to travel and work together day in and day out, and rarely get a 
vacation from each other\'s company, so it\'s important to give anyone plenty of 
room so they don\'t feel stifled." [a menacing look at Windy] "Wouldn\'t you 
agree, sweetheart?"

WINDY [sweetly]: "My sentiments exactly, love."

MG: "Are there ever battle lines drawn among the band members? I mean, there 
are an awful lot of ways you all could be polarized over an issue: by race, by 
age, even by sex."

MOTORMUTT: "Nobody fights about sex, young lady. Not in this crowd." [I wince
involuntarily, expecting another blowup from Tinker, but she seems quite
content to gently lick the outside of her mate\'s ear.] "I\'ve been living among
shavetails long enough to know a pretty one from an ugly one, and our two are
among the prettiest..." [Torch giggles at this, and Windy blows Motormutt a
kiss]"...but shavetail women aren\'t for me. This one [He flicks an ear at
Tinker] is my only travelling companion and I\'m hers, and every gig takes us
further and further away from any choice in the matter. We fight about anything
and everything, including her stupid badaan sol--kyai!" [Tinker has fastened
her teeth into his ear. He winces but continues gamely.] "...stupid badaan
solos, but never about sex...ki...yi..." [I leave him to extricate his ear from
his mate\'s teeth.] 

MG: "That isn\'t precisely what I meant...."

WINDY: "Oh, he knows, kid, he\'s just being difficult. As a matter of fact, we 
tend to polarize along sex lines a lot, but that has more to do with the 
band\'s lineup than anything else."

MG: "Ah! Because the women always have front stage?"

WINDY: "Mm-hm. It\'s good staging practice to have all of the melody
instruments out front, and in this band that means the stuff the ladies play. 
Since CC usually only does background stuff, he stays back in the rhythm 
section with Hug and \'Mutt, and we have to be careful not to hog the 
limelight...they\'re working harder than we are, and don\'t get any credit."

TINKER: "It\'s good for them. Keeps them in their place. Behind us, that is."
[Motormutt was able to retrieve his ear at last when she opened her mouth to 
speak; he now keeps his ears folded flat against further attacks.]

MG: "Tinker, why the badaan? That\'s a human instrument, isn\'t it?"

TINKER: "Yes, it\'s of pre-Rule of Man Suerrat extraction. It\'s normally used
as a drone instrument for string ensembles, but Vargr have always loved its
sound, even alone. It\'s all the low frequency stuff..." [her ears twitch] "It
seems to work directly on the brain. And when you amplify it, it\'s just
unbelievable. I originally started out on what the Solomani call a base
ghitar, because it was easier to amplify, but the badaan\'s range is so much
lower that there just wasn\'t any comparison." 

MG: "But don\'t Suerrat classicists consider an amplified badaan, well...?"

TINKER [with a half-barked laugh]: "Heretical? Kfaekh, yes! I\'ve been nearly
lynched a couple of times by mobs after my pelt. They don\'t scare me, though;
after all I\'ve been through--" [She is interrupted by Motormutt; a loud bark 
in Gvegh(?). She stares at him, then seems to relax, and finishes sheepishly]
"--what with touring for frontier audiences and all, I don\'t mind a few high-
port critics slinging skymelons at me."

MG: "Hug, you\'ve been awfully quiet all this time. Don\'t you have anything to 
add?"

HUG: [His brow wrinkles in a very human attitude of deep thought; he tweaks a 
whisker, delicately sticks a finger into an ear to clean it, strokes his chin, 
and answers very quietly:] "Nope."

FUSE: [her voice is startling to the uninitiated, a perfect command of 
Galanglic mixed with a throaty purr] "Leave him be. He and I enjoy our places 
in the band, and the work we do with our friends. We have no interest in 
trying to formulate stimulating answers to your questions."

MG: "Not even how you manage to play a ghitar with your hands shaped like 
that?"

FUSE: "I play barre chords a lot. Now if you don\'t mind...."

MG: "Where does the nickname Fuse come from?"

[Fuse\'s ears flatten back against her skull and her eyes narrow to slits]

FUSE: "I have a short temper!"

MG: "Oh. [pause] Um, Torch! Torch, do you ever feel slighted at the lack of 
attention given you as a non-musician member of the band?"

TORCH: [brightly] "Oh, no! Everyone\'s just so nice to one another, no ego 
problems or star complexes, I never feel bad about being a vidtech. If I did, 
they\'d be doing it in the dark a lot more often." [There is a roar of laughter 
from the humans and Vargr, and even Hug and Fuse hiss slightly. Torch turns 
red to the ears and sits a bit closer to Docshock. He speaks, his voice almost
sepulchural in quality.] 

DOCSHOCK: "What she means is that it\'s hard to be unhappy with your lot when 
you\'re in control of the entire show. She and I are the puppet masters, pulling 
the strings. No sound, no light, no concert." [a wintry smile] "Besides, we
do get on stage every now and again. About the only one who doesn\'t is George."

MG: "George? Who\'s George?"

CC: "He\'s our head of security and chief bouncer. He keeps us safe from the 
rowdies." [he raises his voice] "Hey, George!"

[The door slides open. I look up, and see no one. Then, looking down at the 
sound of tiny footsteps, I see a Droyne Sport walking in from the bedrooms;
he has a backstage pass around his neck and a belt with a com unit.]

CC: "George, say hello to the nice reporter."

GEORGE: [in a reedy squeak] "Hello to the nice reporter." [We shake hands.]

MG: "George, what do you really do?"

GEORGE: [proudly] "Head of Security Ops. What humans call a \'bouncer\'."

MG: "You\'re kidding! You\'re the one in charge of protecting...him?" [I point 
at Hug, who grabs my hand and half pulls my arm out of its socket.]

HUG: [dangerously quietly] "George is my friend."

GEORGE: "Let her go, Hug. She\'s no different than anyone else who sees me for 
the first time. Yes, miss, I am. And I\'m good at my job. Have you ever heard of
the band being attacked or harassed in the past three years?"

MG: "Well, no..."

GEORGE: [smugly] "Well, there\'s my record. I\'m krinaytsyuni; nobody can
threaten a Droyne who\'s already dead." 

MG: "...Dead?"

TORCH: [quickly] "He means, ritually dead. He was suicidal before we convinced 
him to join us. He\'d lost his tyafelm, his family group, and was all alone; we 
took him in, and now we\'re his kroyloss, his fraternity, sorta."

CC: "I wouldn\'t trade him in for a dozen Imperial Marines in full armor."
[George\'s tiny chest swells with pride at that.] "He\'s the best--" [He is 
interrupted by a beep from George\'s com unit. George tunes in the unit, 
chitters a few words in Oynprith, listens intently, then speaks to CC]

GEORGE: "Sir, Baskerville reports a theft at the theatre. Someone\'s made off 
with the gate for the concerts!"

[The reaction from the others is startling. Each and every band member is out 
of his or her chair in an instant, heading for the door to the motel suite 
bedrooms. For a brief moment I am reminded of the cool precision of a crack 
military unit. Then, almost at once, they remember me, stumble to a halt at
the doorway, and turn back to look at me. There is a long pause, then----]

CC: "Excuse us. We have to, um, call the police."

TINKER: "And our lawyers."

DOCSHOCK: "The insurance company...."

MOTORMUTT: "Theatre security--just to see what\'s going on, y\'know--"

WINDY: "And our sponsors. Excuse us." [They file out through the door, closing 
it behind them]

	"My experiences from the rest of the evening were quite strange. Not 
having been dismissed, I elected to wait a while and see if they came back. 
After a few minutes of muffled activity from beyond the door, there was 
silence. I waited a few more minutes, then heard movement again beyond the 
door. I knocked, and was greeted by a small utility robot, who told me that 
cleanup of the motel suite was underway, and would I please leave now? I 
glanced beyond the robot; the suites were in a shambles of scattered linens 
and towels, and there was no sign of Near Miss. Or their luggage, for that
matter. Fuming at being abandoned without even a goodbye, I allowed myself to 
be escorted to the door by the cleanup robot. It wasn\'t until I got to the
elevator that I realized that there was only one exit from the room! I went
back and knocked, first quietly, then loudly. There was no answer. I pounded
the door and called; still nothing. Finally, I went down to the lobby; the
desk clerk informed me tersely that the band had checked out, and returned to
watching the special bulletin playing on the newsvid. My gaze wandered to the
vid, and was caught there. It was a news report of a bloody gunbattle in the
city center between a gang of thieves who\'d robbed the theatre not half an
hour before, and an unknown group of mercenaries bent on getting the money
back. Their identity was a mystery; they attacked the barricaded thieves in a
frontal assault via air/raft, and 


	There was the click of a gun\'s hammer being cocked. I lifted my hands
from the keyboard, slowly turning in my chair. There was the revolver,
pointing straight at my face. And on the other end was Tinker, dressed in a
black coverall with a number of patched bullet holes. After what I\'d seen on
the news vid, I wasn\'t surprised. Not one bit. 
	"We\'ve seen enough, shavetail," Tinker said quietly. "Get out of the 
chair." As I did so, the door to the living room opened, and Fuse\'s
head peeked in through the crack. "Living room all clear," she whispered.
	"Bedroom\'s empty too," came another quiet voice. I turned my head 
to look; it was Torch, holding the biggest pistol I\'d ever seen in my 
life in one hand... and a pair of men\'s briefs in the other. Oh God, I thought
sickly. Torch walked up to me and waved the briefs under my nose. "Where is
he?" 
	"He--he\'s not here tonight, I swear! He just left his dirty laundry,
he stays over once or twice a week, please don\'t hurt him, please...." My
voice shook, and my knees wobbled; Torch pushed me back into my chair. I
closed my eyes to hold back the tears, and felt rather than saw the weapon\'s
huge muzzle against my forehead. Torch\'s voice somehow wasn\'t cute any more.
	"I said, where is he?"
	"Not here." It was Windy\'s voice, cool and authoritative. "Open your 
eyes, kid; we\'re not going to kill you. Not yet. Maybe not at all." The cold
pressure left my forehead. I opened my eyes. Windy was there with Torch, 
Tinker and Fuse; the whole sexy lineup, a ghastly parody in black. There was a 
gun in Windy\'s hand, a front-loading 9mm Scout survival pistol with a scope 
and shoulder stock attached. As I watched numbly, Windy pulled a small 
silencer from her belt and screwed it onto the barrel. She pointed the gun at 
my sweat-beaded forehead. The others put their weapons away. There was no
longer a need for them, it seemed; the one silent bullet in the scout pistol
was all they needed. 
	I forced composure into my voice. "What do you want?"
	Windy\'s voice, still cool, held the trace of a smile. "Kill the story.
At least the gnarly parts."
	"Why should I?" I was determined not to die like a coward, if I
had to die at all. "The truth\'s the truth! Do you know what a story this is?
\'ROCK BAND DOUBLES AS MERCENARY UNIT!\' It would make my career!"
	"And ruin ours." Fuse\'s voice was an angry hiss. Her hand slowly 
reached inside her jumpsuit and remained there. "Do you think we want to be
known as \'the band that bathes in blood?\' That\'s why we left the Marches! No
more frontier wars, no more corsairs and petty warlords killing each other for
the scraps the Glorious Imperial Navy and the Zhodani leave behind when the
maps are redrawn...." 
	"No more hordes of morons drooling over the reality simulations," 
Tinker growled in assent. "Utovoghs? Oekhsos? Pfagh!" She spat.
	Torch nodded, her tiny face pale and drawn. "We\'ve come into the main 
body of the Imperium just to leave the fighting behind. So many mercenary 
units pass through Guranthu on the way to Reaver\'s Deep that the police will 
never catch us."
	"Assuming nobody helps them, that is," Tinker snarled.
	Torch waved her into silence. "Can\'t you see? If you run that story,
we\'ll never be able to play another concert. We\'ll be ruined."
	"Then why\'d you agree to the interview in the first place? You must 
have realized the risks...."
	"What risks?" Tinker sneered. "That there\'d be action so close to the 
interview? Kfaekh, if that robbery hadn\'t taken place, you\'d have just tossed
us off as another bunch of behind-the-claw weirdos who didn\'t interview well!"
	"The point is, the damage is done. Or rather, is ready to be done."
Torch looked me in the eyes. "We want you to promise us not to run the story."
	"And if I don\'t?"
	No one answered that. Windy merely cocked her pistol.
	"And what if I do promise? You\'ll leave, and ship offworld, and I
could just run it anyway." 
	"You wouldn\'t do that." Windy shook her head with a smile. "You\'ve got
your reputation as a journalist to protect. Breaking a vow of confidentiality?
It doesn\'t matter how good the story was; you\'d divebomb your own career."
	"Besides," Fuse said mildly, "You\'d only prolong your life until the 
news reached us...and next time it might not be as clean as a bullet to the 
head." Almost casually, she pulled her hand from her jumper and opened it 
before my eyes, showing me what she was holding. I couldn\'t help it-- I
screamed blue murder. Windy\'s pistol cracked me across the mouth, cutting off
my cries. She stuck the gun under my nose and held my chin still with one
strong hand. I thought I could smell the bullet waiting for me. 
	As long as I live, I will never forget the next words Windy said. She
was as matter-of-fact as if she were discussing whether or not to pursue a 
questionable stock deal, or perhaps to squash a harmless but annoying insect. 
	"We\'re through asking. You\'re only getting one chance. Yes or no?" 
	The silence stretched for what seemed like hours. I thought about 
life, death, bloodshed, remembered the horrible scenes on the vid, the thieves
mowed down as they tried to escape, the screams of the crowd-- and then the 
screams changed to something else. Not screams of terror, but screams of joy 
and adulation, the earsplitting shrieks of kids having more fun than Mom and 
Dad would ever allow, if they only knew. The concert! The crowds dancing in 
the aisles, the people clapping their hands and singing along to the parts 
they knew, no harm done, just fun, just music... and the musicians. There they 
were, bathed in the lasers and the spotlights, sweating with the effort, 
driving rhythm and screaming melody in the light, smiles on every face. They 
were free... alone with each other, alone with their fans, free for a while 
from cares, from worries about what lay ahead on the long starlit road, free
from...from what? I\'d wondered about that for a long time, watching them up
there. Now I knew, and it made my decision for me. 
	I wasn\'t ready to die after all. "I...agree. Yes. I\'ll kill it."
	For a brief moment, I wasn\'t sure I\'d made the right choice. What 
happened next banished my doubts. The tension in the room vanished like smoke 
in the wind. Windy lowered the pistol and dropped the hammer, Fuse\'s hand 
(don\'t think about it) went back into her jumper, Tinker released her breath 
in a whoosh as Torch gave me that bright smile again. They trusted me. God 
knows why, but they did. 
	"Thank you. There\'s been enough killing for one day." Torch\'s voice 
held none of the bravado of the previous minute. They filed into the dining
room. The dining room? At the door, Windy turned to me and spoke: 
	"Remember to keep your promise." The cold half smile. "We keep ours."
And then she was gone. I was frozen for a long moment. Then I leaped from my 
chair and ran to the dining room.
	Of course! The balcony door was unlocked; after all, who\'d come in on
the 300th floor? And there it was: the gleaming black air/raft with the
traditional trimmings of a hearse, Motormutt at the controls, Docshock and Hug
scanning the skies and the street below for pursuit, a black flutter of bionic
wings that had to be George, and at the center of it all, CC lounging in the
passenger seat, gauss pistol in hand and smiling like he hadn\'t a care in the
world. The last lady climbed aboard, oblivious to the thousand-meter drop
below, and the raft pulled away from the building. CC waved, a light goodbye,
and the raft heeled over and was gone like a wraith in the night. 
	There was someone pounding on the door. "Miss! Miss! I heard a scream! 
Are you all right?"
	"Coming..." I managed. I touched the bruise on my mouth as I walked
to the door. I decided I\'d fallen and cracked my chin against the desk. And on
my way there, I stopped to archive and delete the article. After all, a
promise was a promise, and besides, maybe being worthy of Near Miss\'s trust
wasn\'t such a bad thing after all.

In response to Bob Mahoney\'s query:
> As an aside, I never received any answers to my earlier question:
> Is anyone else using the GDW "Shattered Imperium" campaign background?

I thought that the "Shattered Imperium" background was THE most
valuable aspect of MegaTraveller.  I used to have a tough time
coming up with plots for my Traveller campaign, but the
Shattered Imperium is just spilling over with them.   My
campaigns tend to be based on roughly equal portions of
military, political, and economic intrigue -- the SI setting
is conducive to all of these things.

I am currently in the process of setting up my first SI
campaign.  The campaign will take place in the Spinward
Marches, where Lucan and Norris are duking it out for 
support of the citizenry.  Lurking in the background, an
alien race with expanionist tendencies has recently entered
through an ancient technological artifact (a jump gate of
sorts -- similar but not identical to the one described
in previous TML articles) and is preparing for a covert
invasion....

The only player (at this point) is a pirate character, and
most of the adentures will be tailored with this in mind.

What follows is a rough, unedited set of notes that I
have been using to flesh out the major players and
plotlines.  It may contain inconsistencies and hazy
areas, and should be treated as raw material.  I offer
it as an example of what a Shattered Imperium campaign
might be like.

One last note:  I strongly recommend "The Rebellion
Sourcebook" supplement for anyone trying to run an SI
campaign.  It contains a wealth of material about who
is doing what to whom in the struggle for inter-galactic
power.  It is virtually free of game mechanics and could
be used in other game systems (old Traveller certainly).

Notes on Trav Campaign
- ----

- - The thrust of the campaign is the presence of aliens in the
Spinward Marches.

- - The aliens got there through a jump gate, the location (and
in fact, the very existence) of which is unknown.  The gate
may be a two-way device.  If not, there will exist another gate
which leads to the aliens\' home part of the universe.

- - There are several races of aliens which tend to serve very
specialized roles/classes.  There is at least a warrior class,
a worker class, and a leader class.  Each of the classes exceeds
the average human in their particular capacity but are inferior
in other capacities.

- - The aliens are in possession of some extremely advanced
technology (including the jump gates, some starships, weapons,
machinery, etc) -- but they didn\'t invent it.  They don\'t
even understand it completely, although there is a scientist-like
class which devotes almost all of its time to discovering the
secrets of the technology.

- - The technology was actually created by yet another highly
advanced race which is for the most part extinct.  The reason
for this extinction is as yet undetermined.

- - The aliens are extremely expansionist and war-like.  They
aren\'t inherently evil, but for centuries they have been at
odds with each other over various and sundry issues, not the
least of which is the possession of property (or lack thereof).
The discovery of the gate and the human race has given them
a new alien to conquer and a reason to temporarily join forces.
Of course, each race sees itself in the dominant role both during
and after the conquest -- cooperation is still not exactly their
strong suit.

- - No one knows about the aliens yet, but their effects have
been felt and a very few of those in the know are aware that
SOMETHING is out of place.  Particularly, Norris and Lucan have
both lost warships to encounters with the aliens.  Each suspects
that the other is somehow involved.

- - Lucan and Norris are maintaining the outward appearance of
cooperation and negotiation, but it\'s strictly diplomatic
maneuvers. 

- - What Lucan really wants is for Norris to buckle
under, for Noris\'s considerable forces to fall in line with 
Lucan, and for Norris himself to be replaced by a loyal Lucan
supporter.  Lucan isn\'t trying an outright assault because
it would consume a considerable amount of his
resources to engage Norris\'s forces, and Norris\'s forces
are too loyal to provide any assistance of their own to Lucan.
Such an assault would have political as well as military costs
because the people of Norris\'s domain are highly loyal.  Despite 
the fact that Norris professes loyalty to the Empire, Lucan
does not wish to force them to choose between Norris and himself,
for Norris is a more charismatic leader and has greater presence
in their daily lives.  Lucan\'s plan is to strategically apply 
covert military pressure and try to force Norris to make the
first outwardly aggressive move.  If Norris makes enough visible
moves against Lucan, Lucan can portray him as anti-imperial and
wage a stronger political campaign on those grounds.  One of
Lucan\'s ploys in this vein is to try and appoint highly charismatic
officials in Norris\'s arena of control in order to counter
Norris\'s own charisma.  Of course, they are basically figureheads,
and the real power is in the hands of a small group of Lucan\'s
real lieutenants who are considerably less charismatic.  This
combination of charismatic figureheads and brutal power holders
tends to severely tax the loyalty of Lucan\'s forces, which is
yet another reason why an outright military assault would be a
costly move for him.

- - What Norris really wants is for Lucan to give in and leave
him alone.  Norris believes that Strephon is still alive,
and that Lucan is a sorry replacement.  Norris keeps a tight
reign on his political image and power.  He intends that the
citizens should eventually feel more loyal to him personally than
to the empire.  When the time is right, he will transfer this
support to Strephon.  Until then, he wants to keep it out of
Lucan\'s hands.  When the news of the assassination reached Norris\'s
domain, it was politically necessary for Norris to claim to
support the empire without claiming support for any particular
claimant of the throne.  If he had done otherwise, it would appear
that he was yet another pretender, and not a strong one at that.
In this way, he was able to hold onto the loyalty of the citizenry
and at the same time gain some real political power of his own.
Norris is now trying to gently transform that loyalty directly
onto himself, but he has not progressed far enough to make an
outward attack on Lucan.  Such an attack would weaken his platform
of support for the Imperium visibly.  Although he would doubtless
maintain many of his supporters, he knows he would lose many to
Lucan\'s side.  Norris knows that Lucan is trying to provoke him
to make exactly such a mistake, and is carefully guarding his
actions to maintain the outward appearance of cooperation (much
to Lucan\'s consternation).  Norris takes advantage of any opportunity
to make Lucan look foolish or violent, and there have been many
such opportunities.  To date, Lucan\'s efforts to weaken Norris\'s
support have only made it stronger due to Norris\'s impressive
military and political savvy.  Norris does not want to side with
Strephon until the loyalty of his constituents is unshakable and
Strephon can gather enough military and political support of his
own to appear to be a suitably strong figure.

- - Contrary to the beliefs of Archduke Norris and the guarded hopes
of billions of citizens, Strephon is dead.  Dulinor killed him
on that fateful day in 1116.  The person claiming to be
Strephon is actually an actor who replaced him in routine diplomatic
functions when the need arose.  Secreted away by Strephon\'s closest
supporters, this actor has undergone surgery to make him as physically
indistinguishable from Strephon as possible and is constantly under the
advisement of the supporters who engineered the masquerade.  This
handful of men desires first that the Imperium be brought back
under control long enough to peacefully hand the reigns of power
down to a capable successor (certainly not Lucan) and second to
avenge the death of Strephon.  The "new" Strephon makes frequent
public appearances to gain support, but his private appearances
are avoided whenever humanly possible to prevent discovery that
he is not the real Strephon.  The engineers know that such a
discovery will irrevocably ruin not only their own lives, but
their hopes of restoring peace to the Imperium.  They guard
the secret with an appropriate amount of vigor.

Some folx have asked me if Near Miss is based on a real party of PCs from an 
old campaign. In fact, they aren\'t; they were all invented by me for the 
GenCon events, but over the past five years, people who return to play the 
same characters every year have gradually helped me flesh out the people 
behind the character sheets.
One thing that folx may be interested to know, though, is that Near Miss\'s 
music does in fact exist, and it\'s performed to an extent by myself and a 
small group of musicians here in Pittsburgh. We use synthesis, voice 
treatment, and sound processing to imitate the use of alien instruments, and 
our early experiments in this stuff aren\'t really publishable but show 
promise. In the meantime, for those of you in need of a small exercise in 
creative RPG visualization, I recommend the following:

1. Sit down (or stand up, if you\'re the dancing/air-guitar type) in a darkened 
room with a pair of headphones and a stereo setup.

2. Visualize the following: a large, open stage, almost devoid of clutter and 
tangled wires, in front of a large, raised platform covered with electronic 
junk. On the platform are two drum sets flanking a stack of electronic 
keyboards: one set is spartan and sparse, consisting of six or seven huge 
drums and nothing else, the other is a bewildering array of congas, cymbals, 
electronic pads, wood blocks, and a row of dried-out Vargr skulls arraanged by 
pitch. Behind the simpler drumset, place a seven-foot Aslan male with 
drumsticks the size of billy clubs in his hands; at the percussion array,
place a male Vargr in garish clothing. Place a human male, about 36 years of 
age, behind the keyboards. On the front stage, place three females: an Aslan
wrestling with an electric guitar, a Vargr plying something that looks like a 
fretless bass guitar with an impossibly long neck, and a human woman with an 
electric guitar or a saxophone (depending on your tastes). All are in their 
thirties, but still quite lovely by the standards of their respective races, 
and all are dressed in fashions that may well shock the close-minded. Give 
them all a lot of energy, and put a smile on every face; after all, they\'re 
playing music, which beats the heck out of merc work for making a living.

3. Put on the album REMAIN IN LIGHT by the Talking Heads (there are some 
better albums for the parallelism, but most are hopelessly obscure), and
drop the needle on the song "The Great Curve."

4. Turn the volume up as loudly as you can bear, start the song, and let your 
imagination go berserk.

Am I crazy? Perhaps. But two or three songs like this and DAMN I\'m psyched for 
a good Traveller game! |->

I also like Vargr, because they can do pretty much as they like. Greedy little
cowards they are not (at least, not all). I played in a campaign which started
off with all human characters, until I bought the Vargr Alien Module and rolled
one up. I had in fact joined a campaign after its first adventure, which had
been to deliver a cargo of liquors to Roup. The others, while there, had helped
themselves to a decrepit scout/courier and parked it in the scout base while
they went to get parts for its jump-drive, and someone who could fit them.
Enter my ex-Army, ex-Navy Vargr, who amongst other skills had Engineer-2. When
we got back, we found a pirate ship in port. My Vargr, having no respect for
authority, took the scout ship down next to it and calmly blew its drives out,
then lifted off again, followed by much noise from air-traffic control. Roup
wasn\'t pleased with us, because the scout/courier was 1/4 of their navy! We
went to a naval base to report the pirate ship. The choice was Regina or Feri;
we chose Feri because it was smaller, and might let us help capture the
pirates. In fact they sent a Gazelle-class escort, which tolerated our company.
Back at Roup, the Navy commander demanded that the pirates be handed over, and
some prisoners were brought forward. I can\'t remember why, but we got a bit
suspicious; the prisoners turned out to be political prisoners from Roup, and
not one pirate among them. Now the Navy officer had no authority to threaten a
planet\'s government. Nor did my Vargr, but that didn\'t stop him doing so anyway
on behalf of the Navy. The pirates were brought forward.

My next coup was to get all these humans to visit the Vargr\'s home planet,
Kedzudh. I\'d spotted in the Alien Module that this place was TL16, law level 1.
You can check this if you don\'t believe me - it may be a printing error, but it
is there. The problem was that we had to pass a corsair base on the way. Now
my Vargr had high Charisma, and his plan was to let a corsair attack, then take
command of it. It didn\'t quite work out like that, there was a bit of a fight,
but we ended up with the corsair and most of its crew. One or two humans died
in the fight; they took Vargr as new characters. In due time all the humans
died or left, and were replaced by Vargr.

We also had a mercenary game using just Aslan in one of their formalized wars.
Each side was allowed a fixed amount of money and a limited set of stuff from
which to buy what they wanted. This time I was refereeing, as well as running
one side; the players had PC\'s in the other side. They had serious trouble as
I invested a lot in air power, and in particular one 50 ton cutter fitted out
with every piece of electronics available from Striker to TL12. Eventually they
won by getting some Assassins (Aslan Ninja/commandos) into my H.Q.

The figures I\'m currently painting for variant traveller are 20mm and 25mm
figures from Ral Partha\'s lines for Call of Cluthlu, Danger Int\'l, etc.,
and Twilight 2000.  The TW2000 figures are variously NATO and WARPACT
soldiers and semi-armed indigenous personel, with modern weapons.  They\'ll
paint as SF even better than the WWII figures mentioned previously.  20mm
figs can be used on the 100:1 maps designed for 15mm figs without the extreme
stresses of 25mm.  Alternatively, you can use blow-up mode at your favorite

	Here is some stuff which a friend of mine has ask me to repost.

     1)  Can a ship in a black globe be detected by a densitometer?
     2)  Can a ship in a black globe be affected by a repulsor or
 tractor?
      Its not necessary to get the right answer, just one that seems
 consistent with Traveller.  As the answers build up and the discussion
 progresses, there might be a problem with consistency, in which case
 we can go back and change an answer.
      To let you know what I\'m really doing, I\'m planning to write an
 article tentatively called "Tech Briefs: Gravitics".  This is an
 intensely complex subject considering the many different ways
 gravitics are employed in Traveller, from stiffeners to TDX.ALI\'m not
 so concerned about explaining gravitics as I am about describing
 reasonably and consistently how it is applied in Traveller.  So, I\'m
 hoping this open discussion with the rest of you will help.
      I\'m starting off the black globe because Mike Jackson (Third
 Imperium fanzine; Canada) was thinking of doing an article for Digest
 on globes.  So, this will help his work as well.
                                                            MIKE MIKESH
     Mass is related to momemtum (the faster you go the heavier you get). 
     If a ship has momemtum it has mass (as far as I know, at least according
to Einstein\'s theories).  However, I don\'t know if it has the mass that could
be detected by a densitometer (I don\'t believe densitometers measure mass as
such).  Maybe WILSON can pass this onto USENET (there might be more technical
people there, ie. some people who know more physics than we do, to give us a
better answer).  If the globe has mass, it might probably be affected by a
tractor or repulsor.

>      1)  Can a ship in a black globe be detected by a densitometer?

	Well, my understanding was that a black globe sucked up all
	incident "energy".  Apparently, this is all energy in the form
	of electromagnetic radiation.  Less understandably, the Black
	Globe affects the manueverability of the craft inside.  I have
	assumed that this is because as well as absorbing the
	electromagnetic force (photons), it absorbs gravity too
	(gravitons), rendering reactionless thrustors and gravitic drives
	useless.

	This leaves the strong and weak nuclear forces
	which it apparently doesn\'t affect.  I don\'t know if it can
	affect the strong force; this might make it capable of
	disintegrating the nuclei of matter which passes through it,
	which would liberate a lot of energy and make it a very bad idea
	to let the black globe touch any matter.

	As the black globe absorbs gravitons, it shields the ship inside
	from the gravitational effects of the outside.  Hence, while the
	black globe is "on", the ship would not appear on a
	densitometer, which indicates in which direction large sources
	of gravitons exist.

	But, the black globe "prevents any transit" of matter across its
	boundary.  How it accomplishes this is a mystery to me.  My
	guess is that it appears to be matter to matter striking it,
	meaning that it has an electronic/nuclear structure that
	resembles matter.  To prevent degenerate forms of matter from
	bursting through the field, the black globe would need to appear
	as dense as neutronium, while maintaining its masslessness.
	Perhaps this is achievable by weaving a web of nearly
	impenetrable strong nuclear force over the surface of the globe.
	I would suppose that if someone sent an ultradense kinetic

	A repulsor or tractor creates a directed (anti-) gravity field,
	or conceptually, a stream of (anti-) gravitons, to affect its
	target.  I would think that the black globe would render a
	degree of immunity from gravity weapons similar to its immunity
	from densitometer detection.

Now, since a black globe is flickering, the ship should emit and absorb
gravitons any time the block globe is off.  For stealth, the globe ought
to be set to flicker at a rate which makes the ship appear to be
invisible.  For protection from gravitic weapon fire, the black globe
should be on as much as possible.

I would think that combining gravitic and electromagnetic sensors would
make detecting a stealthy black-globe-equipped ship much simpler, since
the black globe has two desriable flicker rates: one which makes it
blend into the electromagnetic background, and one which makes it blend
into the gravitic background.  If these two flicker rates are quite
different, the ship will have to choose to hide from a particular type
of sensor and will be visible (to some degree) with the other.  The
greater the disparity in desirable flicker rates, the more obvious the
ship is.  Considering the sensitivity of sensors, I would choose to
always flicker the black globe for electromagnetic stealth; the gravitic
sensors tend to be less sensitive for locating an object, and less able
to indicate the type/configuration of a object that is only visible
gravitcally.

Ah, but photons have MOMENTUM, but are MASSLESS!  I think the key is in
interpreting densitometers as graviton counters.  I also think that the
globe itself need not mass anything, instead taking the form of a
multi-force field matrix (electromagnetic, strong, gravitic) bound into a
limited region of space (a sphere), with siphons to redirect energy flow
into appropriate collectors, which absorb the energy and store it as
stored electric potential in capacitors.

	I\'m neither particularly knowledgable about physics nor traveller,
but the impression I seemed to get from reading about Black Globes was that
they weren\'t so much mass as energy of a sort... or to be more specific,
lack of energy.  I suppose that the simplest way to think of them is that 
they generate a field of some sort that then conducts energy directed at
it into some storage medium hooked up to the field generator.  Since energy
cannot escape from the Black Globe, it would seem reasonable that the 
densitometer cannot detect the mass of the ship within it... then again,
if the densitometer works not by detecting gravitic energy, but by sensing
the changes in the "shape of space" caused by mass, it would be reasonable
to assume that it CAN detect the ship.  Too many unknowns, I suppose.

>      Mass is related to momemtum (the faster you go the heavier you get). 

	Uh, not quite... it\'s sort of the other way around.  Just because
there is a Mass ==> Momentum relationship doesn\'t mean that there is a 
Momentum ==> Mass relationship.

	If a ship has mass and is moving, it has momentum (same disclaimer).

	Same problem as above... I\'m not really sure how densitometers
could detect gravity...

 From David Lai, Chief of the United Kingdom (UK)\'s HIWG division: -
     WHAT IS HIWG? The History of the Imperium Working Group (HIWG)
is dedicated to the development of material for the Universe of the Third
Imperium during the Rebellion Era, featured in GDW\'s MEGATRAVELLER game.  It
was originally founded by Ed Edwards and Mike Mikesh in the United States in
1987, and since then the membership has grown steadily to over seventy members
in the USA, Canada, and the UK.  Because of some of the "professional"
contacts it has, some of the work of HIWG has already made print in the pages
of GDW\'s REBELLION SOURCEBOOK.
     Primarily, HIWG is a postal discussion group.  Much of what is discussed
revolves around the politics of the Rebellion and events, rather than
adventures and equipment for characters to buy.  
    Like many things in life, you get as much out of HIWG as you put into it,
so if you are interested in a certain aspect of MEGATRAVELLER or the
Rebellion, chances are that there\'s someone in HIWG who\'s either currently
conducting a discussion on it, or is willing to start!  To help with
discussions, members can volunteer to take on a post as a correspondent or
analyst for a particular region (Domain or Sector) or a faction of the
Rebellion (e.g. Lucan\'s Imperium, ani confederation, etc), that interests them
and attempt to furnish the region with further dtail.  These posts are
 assigned on the basis of "first come, first served", and so it\'s best for new
members to inquire what vacancies exist first before applying for a post.
There also exist other special interest groups that consider certain aspects
of the Rebellion, such as the Science and Technology Special Interest Group,
which considers the implications of the technology of the TRAVELLER Universe,
and the Espionage Secial Interest Group which considers the activities of the
various intelligence agencies active during the Rebellion.  Other interest
groups seek to promote the use of computers in TRAVELLER and to exchange
magnetic data. Three groups already formed are for the Atari-ST, Amegia, the
IBM PC.
     The main means of expression outside letter writing is a HIWG
Publication.
 Sometimes in a letter, one can find that you can waffle on for several pages
on one particular topic, which with a little tidying up could constitute a
small article.  Sometimes one might wish to discuss a certain problem, such as
"Who is the \'real\' Strephon?", in the form of an open ended article inviting
comment.  In each case, they could be turned into a HIWG Pub and made
available (for a small photocopying fee) to anyone who was interested.


HOW TO JOIN HIWG

The new member package for HIWG contains:
      1) the latest TIFFANY STAR
      2) the official 1125 map of the Imperia by Marc Miller
      3) a really spiffy certificate of membership in HIWG in your name
      4) example HIWG Pub (this varies from new member to new member - 
 depends on what I have extra copies of - of course. I send out copies
 of the $0.30 items, not the $3.00  items).
      5) HIWG Pub List (HPL) - denotes the organization of HIWG
 and the HIWG Pubs available for ten cents a page.

 The normal membership in HIWG costs $12 per year.  This includes six issues of
 the fanzine: TIFFANY STAR (TS).

	A while ago, someone was asking about the source book for cyberpunk
in 2300 AD. The name is called Earth/Cybertech Source book. Only a small
portion of the book deals with Cybertech. The equipment listing is incomplete,
I mean just image, you can\'t have telescopic eyes installed? However, there
is still hope. The next two adventures that\'s going to be release by GDW
are cybertech based adventure. Also, Challenge will have a couple of articles
that deals with cybertech. GDW is doing their best to improve the cyberpunk
stuff in 2300.

	Hope this helps.

Since I can\'t conceive of how a "real" black globe could possibly be
engineered, your suggestion makes as much sense as any other.

If we assume your suggestion is correct, then it would be easy to blow
up a ship by throwing enough mass at a high enough speed at the black
globe.  Shoot a heavy piece of ordinance at .9c at the black globe, and
watch the sparks fly!

Alternatively, you could keep the Black Globe installation on a ship a
secret.  Then, as the opponent brings his fighter or boarding ship in
for the kill, you wait for them to get closer, closer, closer, and turn
on the shield at the last minute.  WHAM! It\'s as if they just crashed
into an asteroid.  Hope your capacitors can handle the kinetic energy
and resultant fuel explosions aboard the incoming craft.

I would tend to think that letting a mass with large kinetic energy
strike the black globe is almost as useful as letting it strike the hull
of your ship.  CRUNCH!  Only it\'s worse because having the capacitors
explode is an internal explosion, whereas hull damage is external
damage.

If we really wanted to get carried away, we could assume "all energy"
means kinetic, radiant (E-M, Gravity, Nuclear) and potential energy.
This would mean that the binding energy of molecules, atoms, and
subamtomic particles is absorbed by the field.  Unfortunately, this
would cause everything that struck the field to act as if it were a
nuclear explosion, and the matter would disintegrate.  This doesn\'t seem
to match the intended game balance.

I\'m getting tired of theorizing.  Does anybody have "The Mote in God\'s
Eye" by Pournelle and Niven (I think those were the authors)?  I would
sure appreciate someone searching for an explanation of what the original
black globe was.

    This weekend my friend and I *finally* got around to
    trying out MegaTraveller.  Our objective was not to
    start a game, but merely to exercise the rules a little
    bit to see if we understood and/or liked them.  Several
    questions, observations, and potential modifications
    suggested themselves, which I would like to submit for
    your analysis and commentary:


    (1) How many printings are there?  This isn\'t really a
    rules question, but during the course of play it became
    clear that there were discrepancies between my manuals
    and my friend\'s.  The discrepancies we noticed were in
    the combat section.  His copy has a typo about the
    maximum DM to any roll being *18*.  However, his copy
    also has some additions and/or corrections to the
    personal slug throwers table on p76.  We bought our
    boxed sets in the same store, about 4-6 months apart
    (mine first).  This isn\'t really devastating or
    anything, since we tend to be "house rules" players
    anyway.  However, I was extremely annoyed that not only
    do I have to live with inexcusable editing, I have to
    live with conflicting sets of inexcusable editing.  What
    gives?


    (2) Surprise roll:  Surprise is a DIFFICULT task and on
    exceptional failure, the defending party has surprise
    instead.  This seems utterly nonsensical to me.  Since a
    difficult task is an 11+, which makes exceptional
    failure a 9-, it is far more likely for the party making
    the first agressive move to be surprised....

    Tom:    "Let\'s hide in the bushes and ambush the sentry
            when he comes by!"

    Fred:   "Don\'t be a fool!  We\'ll stand out in the open and
            wait for him to make the first move.  Then we\'ll
            surprise him for sure!"
  
    Am I missing something here?


    (3) Exceptional????  Why is "exceptional"
    success/failure only +/- 2?  It seems to me that with
    such a small spread between success/failure and
    exceptional success/failure, then the latter is going to
    occur more often than the former.  In other words,
    the exception is not exceptional after all, but normal.
    We decided that +/- 4 would be exceptional
    success/failure.  This also has some sort of symmetry
    with the +/- 4 division between various difficulties of
    tasks.  That is, exceptional success on a difficult task
    requires the same effort as regular success on a
    formidable task.


    (4) Starship computers in combat:  Even in old Traveller
    I disliked how much the ship computer affected starship
    combat.  I\'d rather have the outcome be determined by
    the skills of the crew, not how much the owner layed out
    for a computer.  On the other hand, I don\'t want them
    factored out entirely.  I picture the real heavyweight
    ships (battle cruisers, dreadnoughts, and so forth) as
    having computers which are powerful enough to affect
    combat.
 
    Our solution to this was first of all to replace all
    DM\'s for computer level by appropriate skills (piloting,
    gunnery, sensor ops, and so on).  Optionally, the
    computer level *divided by three* can serve in place of
    the appropriate skill, fractions rounded down.  Our
    experience has been that this rule does a good job of
    simulating the balance between human skills and
    computers that we want in our games (heavily slanted
    toward the humans).


    (5) Starship agility:  We don\'t like this attribute at
    all.  Scientific or not, we want the ship\'s maneuver
    drive capabilities to represent it\'s combat agility.  So
    a "fast" ship is one with a 6-G Maneuver drive, not one
    with a 1-G drive and an oversized power plant.  (Of
    course, it will take more power plant to support the
    bigger drives.)  Our house rule is that agility =
    Maneuver drive.  Seems to work for us so far.

Cosmos # 7.  A variant rules system based on Traveller.
___________________________________________________________________________


FORCE SCINCE (TECHNO MAGIC) for Cosmos
(a simple to complex system)

Much of the burden for inventingw spells falls on the players.  The
"rules", in this case, are nothing more than an attempt to mold PC
talents as they naturally unfold in the game.  Mention is made of
Spell Schools int this posting, but I never actually defined them.  As
with spells there could be many types of schools defined by PCs once
they learn "Force Science".  The existing schools are all part of one
alien culture and thus, in theory, only a small part of the magical
component of the campaign.  Briefly, existing alien schools are:

    School Name                        Color
- ----                ----
Time/Paratemporal                      Blue
Life/Death/Healing/Animation           Green
Battle/War/Destruction                 Red
Illusion/Senses                        Silver
Dream/Subconscious/Suggestion          Amber
Conjuration/Emination                  Black
Atomic Creation/Negation/Alteration    White
Communication/Speech/Teleportation     Yellow
Embodiment/Teaching/Reading/Writing    Violet

Any resemblance to Andre Nortons novels is coincidental.  At the end
of the posting is an offering of six spells written in Canonical Form.
In future postings at audience request, I will include new interesting
spells as they are invented.  Note that this system can describe
spells of infinite variation.

Cosmos Magic (Force Science)

     All living and some non living things have a primal force of
being binding their relationship to time, energy and space.  It is
possible for a sentient being or "object" to tap into the force and
become its medium.  In theory what then can be done is unlimited
depending on the ability of the medium or caster.  Psionics are
related to the force in how they work but are solely derived from
mental powers where magic is derived from the omnipresence of nature.
Psionics are part of unconscious and conscious processes of the
sentient being where magic simply exists as is along with all other
natural phenomenon.
      There are two ways to learn magic.  The more difficult is
without an instructor.  In League Cosmos history there are
superstitions and myths concerning miraculous powers and events (not
unlike our own myths of magic).  It is possible to study some of these
rituals and if the medium is persistent and "strange" enough they can
learn an undisciplined version of magic.  Because the medium has no
training they must invent their own spells.  These invented spells are
difficult to control and will take a long period of time to master.

Undisciplined Magic

    The time to learn undisciplined magic is variable.  The medium
must practice for approximatley a week.  This requires a save vrs. FOR
on 3D EACH day or the process must start over again.  If the medium is
successful then they have MAGIC-0 and can attempt to cast
undisciplined spells.  During this study period the PC can do
virtually NOTHING else (the first time a group tried this they nearly
starved to death).  The precise restrictions depend on the ritual of
the beings society.  For some it may take less than a week for some
more.  When a PC wants to study magic, I also require that there be a
reason.  The player should role play their way into this. In League
Cosmos society anyone who dabbles in magic would be considered a head
case by most people.  As such the PC runs the risk of losing some SOC
if they persist in these strange practices and fail.  A save vrs SOC
must be made for each time the ritual is attempted.  The transition
from MAGIC-0 to MAGIC-1 means the magic becomes disciplined and the
medium is initiating their school.
     The undisciplined medium may accidently "reinvent" spells already
understood by unkown schools of magic.  The new medium might also
invent an entirely new spell.  The spell invention process can be
initiated when the PC just "tries something random".  So far these
random spells include "float a rock" or "make pretty colors".
Typically I require a roll of 10+ for MAGIC-0 and a possible save vrs
EDU on 3D+3 depending on what the PC is trying to do.  The PC can
attempt to combine MAGIC with an already known skill.  The advantage
of this method over trying random spells is that a skill roll
substitutes for a save vrs EDU.  Obvious examples are MAGIC + SOC SCI,
MAGIC + PHYSICAL SCI. MAGIC + MATH, MAGIC + ARTS OF LOVE, so on.
After some practice (i.e. the transition from MAGIC-0 to MAGIC-1) the
spell is either dropped as useless or is written up in CANONICAL FORM
by the player.

New Spells from Selfdisciplined Magic

     Inventing subsequent spells for the self disciplined medium is a
similar process to that of the first spell learned.  As before the the
medium can "try something random" or combine FORCE SCIENCE with an
exisiting skill to create the spell.  The time required to invent one
solo is 45 days.  If the attempted spell is judged higher than the PCs
level by the GM and if the PC is successful then something similar to
the attempted spell will transpire but at a lower level.  As with
learning an undisciplined spell a save vrs EDU might substitute for a
required skill.

              A roll of 10+ must be made summing the following to
              learn the spell:
              (current MAG lvl of medium)+(1 for each lvl the spell
               is below the mediums current lvl)+(number times the
               medium has failed the spell)+2D

     After success then the player or the GM writes the spell up in
CANONICAL form.

Schools of Force Science

    There are schools that exist in alien societies outside League
Cosmos.  Those PCs that are fortunate enough to make successful
contact with the aliens and then arrive at common goals of life
activity are often given the opportunity to learn magic.  Normally the
student will have an instructor that will work with then over a 45 day
period.  The student gains MAGIC-0 after three successful saves vrs
FORCE on 3D.  An example of how we role played this: McFadden is the
student and La\'Ri is the master.  La\'Ri "blasts" McFadden with a
nondestructive vanilla spell.  McFadden saves vrs FOR on 3D and feels
the FORCE.  Now La\'Ri tries to hit McFadden with a wooden stick and
screams "use the force to deflect the stick".  McFadden saves vrs FOR
and fails and the stick goes "bonk!" right on McFaddens head.  The
next day McFadden deflects the stick with the FORCE three times (i.e.
three successful saves) and has MAGIC-0.  Learning MAGIC-1 is like any
other skill (the masters INSTRUCTOR skill also counts as in any other
skill.  When learning MAGIC-n because of its odd nature the PC MAY
also study a mundane skill.  Often the medium must study MAGIC and a
mundane skill for the spell to work (if they do not already have the
skill).

New spells from a Force Science school

    Learning a new spell from the appropriate school takes approx 20
days (spells must be less than or equal to current level of the
medium).

      A roll of 10+ must be made summing the following to learn the
      spell:
     (current MAG lvl of medium)+(masters INSTRUC lvl)+(1 for each
      lvl the spell is below the mediums current lvl)+(number times
      medium has failed spell)+2D

A 2 always fails as in any skill roll.

Increasing the PCs Level for Magic

    This works like any other skill.  It is possible for a PC to make
levels in MAGIC but only know one spell (this would not be very
useful).  A medium at level n cannot learn spells at n+m where m > 0.

CANONICAL Spell Format (description of)

Spell Name-  The name of the spell, examples SENSE FORCE, FORCE SHIELD, DAMAGE.

Spell Level- An abstract quantification of the amount of FORCE necessary
             for the medium to contour the spell.  The level also is
             a DM on the Magic Skill Usage Table.  An approximate
             description of each level is given below.  Remember these
             do not take into consideration range (varies from spell
             to spell) and the binary affect of using two or more
             generic types simultaneoulsy.

                      telekenetics; temperature ctl @ 1024 deg K.

Spell Range- A quantification of the dimensions of the spell in 3 or possibly
             more dimensions.  For most spells the medium can extend the
             range by expending units of FOR (the PC
             characteristic).  Note that points of FOR expended for the
             range do NOT effect the POWER or the DURATION of the spell.

Spell Unity- This is the minimal number of FOR points required to activate
             the spell.  The UNITY of the spell will automatically render
             a POWER, RANGE and DURATION of the equivalent of one FOR pt
             each.

Spell Power- In a FOR vrs. FOR situation this is a quantification of the
             of the ability of the spell to resist another spell or the
             quantification of the ability of the spell to over come the
             resistance of another spell.  For many spells the medium
             can increase POWER of the spell by expending additional units
             of FOR.  These additional points of FOR do not effect the
             range or duration of the spell.  Power is the active
             component of a spell and can be removed by physical damage.

Spell        The time measured in units (or paratime in units) that the
Duration-    spell lasts.  For most spells the medium can increase the
             DURATION of the spell by expending additional points of FOR.
             These additional points of FOR do not effect the POWER or
             RANGE of the spell.

Spell        The AVAILABILITY of the spell describes whether it is a
Availability-common spell that is know by many schools of magic or is
             rare in the sense that only one school knows this particular
             spell or is unique and only known by the inventor.

Spell Color- This the color of the magic.  It is a flash of light given off
             when the FORCE is collected to do the spell.  Often the color
             is associated to the school.  So far it has nothing to do with
             the spells actual properties.

Spell        The formal name of the school can be included where the spell
School-      was learned.

Spell        Spells always start at the beginning of the round (thus healing
Timing-      spells start to take effect immediately) and will typically
             complete at the end of the round (damage coming from or results
             from the spell that are outside the IMMEDIATE presence of the
             medium go off LAST).  Some unusual spells could take more than
             round.

Associated   Force Science works like any other skill.  Some spells are
Skills-      are going to require associated skills.  For example a Heal
             cast on another species could require XENO-BIOLOGY.

Description  This is a detailed description of how the spell works.  The
of spell-    mechanics should be described in simple terms.

Results of   Describes special effects that result from a "perfect
Clean usage- conduction" of FORCE.  This may not make sense for certain
             spells.

Results of   Describes special effects that may result from "conduction of
Critical     FORCE far beyond the ability of the caster" (see Critical Force
usage-       Table).

Results of   Describes special effects that may result from "botched
Fumble-      casting".  Fumbles can be "recovered" as i any COSMOS skill
Spell        (see Fumbled Force Table).

Spell        Because this is techno magic I might require additional tables
Quanta-      or formulas to describe the spell.


    The Mechanics of Spell Casting

    The medium has a maximum number of spells they can have active at
one instance.  This number is equal to their INT.  A level point is
equal to the spell level per unit, that is, a force scientist with INT
of A (10) could have 10 first level spells active at one instance.  A
medium could with MAGIC-2 with INT = A could have 6 first level spells
and 2 second level spells.  The maximum MAGIC level of the medium is
their INT.

    The mediums maximum number of spells equals their INT * level.
Thus a medium with MAGIC-1 and int of A (10) can have up to 10 first
level spells The same medium with MAGIC-2 could know 20 first level
spells, or 18 first level spells and 1 second level spell, or 16 first
level spells and 2 second level spells, ... and so on.

    The medium can reactivate spells they know from memory (i.e.
spells that they know but are not active).  The cost is one round per
level per spell.  If the medium wishes deactivate a first level spell
and replace it by another first level spell it will take one round.
If the medium wants to deactivate 2 first level spells and replace it
with a second level spell it will cost two rounds and so on.

    The medium can learn new spells to replace spells they know if
they are at their maximum of INT * level.  See "New Spells for
Selfdisciplined Magic" and "New Spells from a Force Science School".

    The medium can increase the FOR characteristic.  The PC designates
that they are studying FOR over an approximate 45 day period.  During
this time other activities may be undertaken but the PC cannot be
studying or trying to increase another skill.  The PC MAY be studying
spells.  The FOR increase roll is nearly identical to other increase
rolls:

    The current FOR + 1 or less must be rolled as [(species max as a
dice roll) + (the number of failures at increasing FOR at the current
level) + (successful INSTRUCTOR skill roll as a level DM by the
teacher) + (up to three successful usages of the FOR during this study
period)]

    So the PC want s to roll low.  The "+" DMs make this easier to do.
The PC can study another characteristic or skill and return to studying
FOR after a failure and still have the DMs apply.

Casting a Spell

    When the Player Character(medium) has a spell in mind to cast the
player rolls 2D as with any other skill.  The typical roll needed for
Force Science is 10+ (9+ for the mediums complete concentration and a
calm invironment).  So let\'s say Mumblefrotz with MAGIC-1 needs a 9 or
better on 2D to cast a spell with no unwanted side effects.  The Magic
Skill Usage Table is consulted to see how many initial FOR points are
gained (or needed) by the medium.  As with all other skills a natural
12 can be a clean or critical skill usage and a natural 2 can be a
recovered or unrecovered fumble.  In many cases there will be no
resistance to the spell.  Assume that this is a level one spell.  An
initial point of FOR is expended to generate the UNITY of the spell
(thus giving the spell a RANGE, POWER and DURATION of one in most
cases).  The medium may choose to expend additional points of FOR to
increase the RANGE, POWER or DURATION.  For each point expended FOR is
decreased by one.  When the spell is cast (at the beginning of the
round) a flash of color is given off by the medium.  Thus Force
Science is a little harder to conceal than Psionics.  Sometimes the
medium must over come another FORCE.  There are two kinds resisting
FOR.  One is passive and is the FOR rating of another object.  This is
the objects passive or inherent force.  Some spells create a
"physical" barrier of the FOR.  This is derived from the POW of the
spell and must be countered by either by physical damage or by
opposing points of POW.  Usually all subsequent incoming spells are
blocked until POW barrier is eliminated.  An active active block of
POW is eliminated on a point-for-point basis (see the spells COUNTER
FORCE, FORCE SHIELD), thus 4 points of POW must be expended to
eliminate 4 points of POW.  When casting a spell directly at another
object or being with FOR then that FOR must be overcome.  In this case
the casters FOR and the resisters FOR are looked up on the Serial Dice
Resolution Matrix.  The caster wants to roll LOW for the spell to be
successful.

Regaining Points of FOR

     Normal rest will restore points of FOR.  For species with an END
below 16 (base ten) points are regained at (16 - END) * .5 (round up).
For each pt of END greater than 15 the one half hour is halfed again,
i.e., at 16 END regain a point every (2**-2) hours, at 17 regain a
point every (2**-3) hours, so on.

Magic Skill Usage Table

    The base to make roll is typically 10+ (as with most skills).
This base roll could be designated higher or lower depending on the
environment the medium is in:

     Base to make =  +n  spell works, n extra FOR pts gained by medium
     Base to make =  +2  spell works, 2 extra FOR pts gained by medium
     Base to make =  +1  spell works, 1 extra FOR pts gained by medium
     Base to make =   0  spell works, 0 extra FOR pts gained by medium
     Base to make =  -1  medium must add 1 additional FOR pt or spell
                         UNITY fails.
     Base to make =  -2  medium adds 2 FOR pts or spell UNITY fails
     Base to make =  -n  medium adds n FOR pts or spell UNITY fails

     Notice that if the medium or caster fails the "base to make" and
does not fumble (i.e. a roll of a natural 2 followed by another miss),
that more than 1 FOR pt must be used where normally one would be used
(in order to drive the spell into UNITY).

Critical Force Table

     A roll is made on 2D.
     12     Caster gets 3 times number FOR pts expended, use results
            of critical usage in canonical form and roll again (the
            second rolls results accrue with the first).

     11     Caster gets 3 times number FOR pts expended, use results
            of critical usage in canonical form.

     10,9   Caster gets 2 times number FOR pts expended, use results
            of critical usage in canonical form.

     8,7    Caster gets 1.5 times number FOR pts expended (round up),
            use results of critical usage in canonical form.

     6,5    Caster gets 3 times number FOR pts expended.

     4,3    Caster gets 2 times number FOR pts expended.

     2      Caster gets 1.5 times number FOR pts expended.

Fumbled Force Table

     A roll is made on 2D.
     12      Spell fails, but there are no side effects.

     11,10   Spell fails, casters FOR goes to one.

     9,8     Spell fails, casters FOR goes to one, use results of
             fumble on canonical form.

     7,6     Spell fails, casters FOR goes to one, use results of
             fumble on canonical form, caster goes unconscious for
             1D rounds.

     5,4     Spell fails, casters FOR goes to one, FOR explosion
             for 1D damage per level to all within 1D * spell level
             meters away.

     3       like 5,4 except caster goes automatically unconscious
             for 1D days.

     2       like 3 except roll again and accrue results (if
             meaningful).

Discussion: A resistance vrs. resistance roll is made (Column vrs.
row).  For the resistance to be overcome the "attacker" or the row
wants to roll low.  To determine the number needed compare the number
below the rows index with that of the columns index.  For the row to
be successful this number or less must be rolled on 2 D serial.  "**"
counts as either 36 or 41.  If a true difference is needed roll a 3rd
D as an indicator.  "+0, +1, +2" are automatic additional units of
strength and "-0, -1, -2" are automatic units of loss if the
difference between row and column is sufficient.  "A" is 10, "K" is
20.  If the distance between the indices is "L" or 21 then the units
of additional loss/strength is -3, ad infinitum.

Description The spell enables the caster to sense the existence of
            active FORCE (magic) in the casters range.  If the
            "object" resists then the answer is a simple "yes" or
            "no" unless a successful FOR vrs FOR roll is made on
            the serial dice resolution matrix.  If this roll is
            made then the caster will know the exact location of

Description of Spell  If the opponents FOR is overcome on the 2D
serial resolution matrix then 1D physical damage is done to the
opponent.  This damage ignores all opposition battle armor (i.e.
is applied directly to END, DEX and STR).  Physical damage to
objects without FOR resistance is automatic.  If the opponent is
resisting with Force Shield (see canonical definition) and there is
insufficient power in the spell to overcome the Force Shield then
physical damage is applied to the shield.

Description of Spell  The spell enables the caster to construct
both a magical AND a physical barrier that can be a complete circle
if the medium is floating in space.  Otherwise the barrier must
somehow conform to where the medium is standing.  If another physical
object is blocking the shield then the serial dice resolution matrix
is used to determine which object gives.  Concentric force shields
maybe cast by the same medium.  Another PC can be inside the shield
with the medium.  Only the medium that created the shield can pass
through it without physically or magically cancelling it.  Each shield
cast has a power rating and a physical damage strength (see Spell
Quantification).  Once cast the shield remains in fixed position.
The shield will hold an atmosphere if it has sufficient physical
strength to do so.

Spell Quantification  Each shield has a number of power points derived
from the spell power units of the caster.  For each power point there
exists a quantity of force that stops incoming spells that have a
spell power less than the shields power rating.  The power rating
remains constant while the shield exists.  The power cannot be
increased by a new spell (though a new shield could be constructed
inside an old one).  There is always at least one point of power
derived from spell unity.  In addition to "pure" force resistance
the shield has physical resistance.  For each point of Power that goes
into the spell 1D is rolled to determine the shields physical strength.
Thus if there are 3 points of Power in the spell there could be from
3 to 18 points of physical strength.  The physical strength of the
shield is removed by physical damage.  The shield does NOT loose any
magical strength until all the physical strength is removed.

              on forward branch or
              backward root timeline.

Description of Spell  The caster and a certain amount of "baggage"
can travel forward or backward in time.  Often when traveling forward
the caster can choose 2 or more diverging timelines if they are sensed
correctly.  Thus forward is travelling from the current point in time
(the root) to a future point in time (1 or more branches).  It is
possible for branches to "recombine" with the main timeline thus
forming a timeline network.  Time travel in the past is similar to the
future except the caster usually moves towards the base timeline
(unless a "recombine" point is found- something rare).  The caster
MUST follow a particular divergent timeline during travel.  The amount
of baggage the caster may shift through time (including themself) is
102,400 KG.  Each additional pt of Force will shift an additional
102.4K KG.  See timeflux and Spell Quantification below..

Results of Fumble: Roll random on time flux table Spell
Quantification: Each time shift is subject to time flux, which makes
it difficult for the caster to know exactly where the shift will stop
on the timeline.  The player designates how far back or forward the
caster will attempt to travel on the time flux table ( a choice of 35
increments).  The GM rolls 2D to determine the amount of flux.  The
player then rolls 2D.  If the number rolled is greater then or equal
to the number the GM rolled, then there is no loss of control during
the shift.  If the number is less than the the number the GM rolled,
the number of increments than it is less becomes the number of slots
that the caster if off on the table.  The direction of the error is
random.  The caster can then compensate for this by expending
additional points of force.  The amount of compensation is 1 increment
in each direction for each point of force.  If the caster shifts off
the low end of the time flux table (past the first slot number), the
caster causes a bifurcation of the time line.  This will cause the
caster and their "baggage" to be either temporarily or permanently
separated from the prime or base timeline.  If the caster shifts off
the high end (last slot number), the player rolls a serial 2D to
determine a random reentry in time.

I don\'t have the book right here as I write this, but this as much of an
explanation as they give (and I remember :)...

Pournelle and Niven never went into the mechanics of the thing (maybe they
couldn\'t decide on a good explanation either? :).  About all they gave was
a simple description of the effects.

Their Black Globe generated a solid field (more on this later)
which absorbed energy including kinetic (to a certain extent), photons (up
through x-rays at least) and so on.  It did NOT absorb gravitons o(r whatever
particles the physcists have decided mediate gravity :).  Therefore,
densitometers would still detect the ship.  Bye the bye, I don\'t believe
the MOTE universe had densitometers sensitive enough to be used to detect ships
at ranges greater than other methods i.e. E-M spectrum.

The MOTE B-G worked on relative velocities.  That is the faster an object was
moving the more energy was absorbed.  This stopped lasers cold.  Also, missiles
moving fast enough to avoid anti-missile defenses (lasers) were also
stopped.  Missiles moving slow enough to get through the B-G (something like
a few meters per second (maximum!) were sitting ducks for the anti-missile
lasers.  However, at one point, a man fell off the ship and got his legs (?)
imbedded in the field.  I believe he ended up with minor frostbite (because
the field absorbed some of the kinetic energy of his molecules) before they got
him out of it.

As stated earlier, the Black Globe generated a solid field which required
energy, of course.  However, it required yet more energy to keep a hole open
in the center for the ship to occupy.  I am not sure if traveller uses the same
mechanism or not (not yet having gotten around to ship design :).  I don\'t
recall why you had to have the hole in the center, or what would happen if the
circuts which kept it open failed....probably something like total vaporization.

The MOTE B-G, unlike traveller, stored the energy it collected in the field
itself and acted as an ideal black body, radiating
excess energy into space.  The globe radiated through the entire spectrumum
 and when it got up to x-ray wavelengths, it wasn\'t far from collapse.  But when
it collapsed, it radiated INWARD instead of outward.  It was possible to
locally overload the field so that the entire ship wasn\'t destroyed, but I don\'t
think you could choose where the damage was taken.

That\'s all I remember, offhand.  If someone sees any errors, post corrections or
more details.

Hi!
Anybody out there that knows what spaceships and smallcrafts that
are included in that vehicle book for MegaT (Sorry, dont know the name)
The reason I ask is because im working on converting a lot of the old
ships (VargrTrader et al) to MegaT stats (Using a spreadsheet, of course.
Doing it by hand is like generating the Imperium with 2 dice and a pencil :-)
And I would like to avoid to duplicate their work.
A final note:
Three Loud Cheers for the Digenst Group! their Starship OPmanual
was better than a lot of genuine GDW products. Have they published
something else for MegaT?

I\'m looking for ideas for services that the Traveller\'s Aid Society could
provide to players. The background is that I\'m starting up a MegaTraveller
game and my players quite reasonably want to know what they get for their
million credits (my players are designing their own characters). As far as
I can tell from the books they just get one High Passage every two months,
which is fine but is superfluous for my players, who are military-based.
Ideas I\'ve had so far include:

	Article storage. Players can check their armaments or
	other valuable equipment with TAS upon landing or upon
	leaving the spaceport to go into the city, on planets
	where carrying arms is not legal. Or they could store
	things there to save a trip back up to an orbiting ship
	just to collect them.

	Secure (and independant) transmission of messages.

	Normal tourist stuff - emergency funds advance, area
	maps and highlights, Better Business Bureau, etc.

Are there any other things which GMs have their versions of TAS do?

Also, is can one purchase GDW books by mail or phone? My local hobby
has about three times as much AD&D stuff as everything else put
together. It\'s very convenient to be able to call ICE and give them a
credit card number (along with everyone else I\'m not using Traveller
combat, I\'m using a simplified SpaceMaster system).

I\'m relatively new to this list, so my apologies if these are stock
questions.

In the Portland Metro area, I highly recommend:

	The Military Corner
	3350 NE Sandy Blvd, Portland, OR
	(503)234-1881

They keep a pretty comprehensive set of the latest gaming stuff, best
I\'ve seen anywhere in Oregon, by a long shot.  Give them a call, I\'m
sure they\'d treat you very responsively.  Make sure to ask for a
Traveller/GDW expert.

Standard Disclaimers apply; I\'m just a happy customer.

If you don\'t feel like making a long-distance call, anyone on this list
is welcome to ask me a question via e-mail and I will call.  I\'d also be
happy to serve as gopher for anyone who wanted to send me enough money
to cover purchasing and postage.  I could probably get most anything to
you in under a month, if it\'s in stock (I usually visit TMC every other
weekend, since it\'s on the other side of Portland).

	Yes, you can call GDW and order stuff so long as you have your 
credit ready. Or you can ask for their catalog then mail order it.

Does anyone know of a source for the "Darrians: masters of Ancient Technology"
supplement?  I\'m running a MT campaign, and one of my players wants to play a
Darrian, having seen an article in a copy of _Challenge_ #25 that I managed to
find... (Thanks again, James!)

Does GDW (or Digest Group) plan to re-issue all the \'old\' books?  As a newbie
referee, I see a lot of ads in old magazines for stuff I\'d love to get...
Any ideas?  I know a comic book dealer who claims he can find me *anything* that
comes on paper, but the man probably wants my firstborn male child as a
downpayment.

Anyone know an ex-gamer?  (Maybe a HUNGRY ex-gamer?)   ;^)

By the way, I\'m still very interested in an exchange of ideas concerning the
ships detailed in the _Rebellion Sourcebook_.  (My intrepid group is currently
zipping across known space in a TJ-type trader at Jump-6, and so far no one has
asked me where thier cabin is...)

Remember:  Space is big.  Really Big.

The 101 Vehicles book (I don\'t remember the title exactly,
sorry) doesn\'t include ANY starships -- I know because I\'m
dealing with exactly the same problem you are -- how to get
all those great Traveller ships into my game without doing
any real work (especially the ones from Supplement 9 -- Fighting
Ships).  The Vehicles book contains things like speeders,
GCarriers, tanks, and all sorts of basically mundane transportation
equipment.

As a sidebar, the "Rebellion Sourcebook" -- which is basically
a rules-free description of the politics and people of the
Shattered Imperium -- does contain plans for a *few* battleships
and cruisers.  These are the only other plans I\'ve seen except
the ones in the Imperial Encyclopedia.  I don\'t have any issues
of the Traveller\'s Digest, they may or may not have printed ship
plans. 

I asked my hobby store clerk, who generally seems to know
what\'s coming out, if GDW had any plans to release something
like the old supplements 7 and 9.  He said he didn\'t know 
of any such releases planned within the next year :-(.

Just how compatible are ships designed under High Guard with the new system?
The sizes of various things have changed; density is no longer constant, which
means mass and volume aren\'t necessarily equivalent any more; and you have to
account for all the sensors separately. As an exercise, let someone try to
design a Type S scout courier, similar in performance and TL to the original,
as designed in Book 2. That means TL9!

Plans?! For what size "battleships"? Remember "Azhanti High Lightning", which
had a dozen or so A3-sized plans of decks, and each plan represented many
similar decks. And that was only a heavy cruiser! I\'d expect the plans for,
say, a "Plankwell" class 200,000 ton battleship to occupy a book by themselves.

How does one get something "Approved for use with Traveller" by GDW? Maybe we
could release our own?

Compatible??? Not at all! :-( :-(
Just look att the Jumpdrives and their fuel consuptions.
In old T (& HighGuard) the drive drunk 10% of the ship volume
in fuel per parsec of jump. In MegaT it\'s appetite is based on the volume
of thwe drive!!! 
(Example: 100tons hull with Jump-6 would require 60(old)tons of fuel
according to the old rules, In MegaT it would only take about 35(old)tons!)
((Old ton is deplacement tons: 1 old ton <=> 13.5 new kilolitres))
The net result is that with old T it was easy to make 6-G Agility-6 ships
but harder to achieve any big jump numbers, In MegaT Jump-6 is a piece of
arcturian cake, but Agility-6 AND non-missile armaments is nearly impossible.

Anybody know if this was intentional or just the result of some goof-up 
when they (GDW) designed MegaT???

On pp 92-97 of the MT Referee\'s Companion there is a rather
interesting section on alien languages, including word generation
algorithms and tables for most of the major alien races.

I used the tables to generate some Zhodani names this weekend,
and it actually worked rather well.  However, it was an extremely
tedious process, requiring several dice rolls for each syllable.

This process is obviously an ideal target for a computer program.
Has anyone written an implementation of these particular tables
yet, preferably in C ??  If not, would anyone be interested in
such a program ?  I\'m sure I\'ll end up writing one eventually,
although I don\'t know how much I could legally distribute and
I have no intention of violating anyone\'s copyrights.

Thoughts, anyone?

PS: I haven\'t heard a thing about the MT questions/observations
I posted a while ago.  Were they really THAT dull??!?

    'body' => '


    Background:
    ----
    Some weeks ago I posted some thumbnail notes about a
    Shattered Imperium campaign I was designing.  The
    campaign will take place in the Querion subsector of the
    Spinward Marches.  The campaign is specifically designed
    for a part of PC pirates.  Although they don\'t know it,
    the PC\'s are being manipulated by one of Archduke
    Norris\'s own right-hand men, to help him accomplish
    military and political missions.

    In order to get a feel for the politics of this
    subsector (none of which falls within Imperial borders),
    I decided to write a program to take the UWP\'s of the
    systems and sort them on each parameter so that I could
    see, for instance, which systems had the highest level
    of technology.

    I then produced a "System Profile" for each system, with
    all the standard parameters and their corresponding text
    descriptions.

    To each System Profile I added some notes about who ran
    the system, where it fit into the subsector economy, and
    anything else that seemed interesting about this
    particular system.  I also generated characters where
    appropriate.

    The result is what I am calling my homebrew campagin
    pack.


    Offer:
    ----
    If anyone is interested, I could submit this pack to the
    mailing list.  It is, however, rather large (~60K last
    look), so I\'m asking before posting.  Once again, the
    notes are in rather rough shape, being intended solely
    for my own use when created, but they might nonetheless
    provide campaign ideas for other refs out there.

    In the next message I am going to post a sampling of two
    system profiles.  I am intentionally choosing two of the
    most interesting ones, most of them are not as lengthy
    or detailed.  I will admit right here that I have
    borrowed from science fiction literature and movies.
    When I looked at the data for Xhosa, it just screamed
    "Foundation" at me, and it fit in so well with the
    general themes of the campaign that I couldn\'t resist.

    I intend to have the pack completed within one week.  If
    anyone is interested, I could post it either in
    installments or one big lump.

     Think Outland.  Atson is a smallish world with no
     atmosphere or water.  What it DOES have is a profitable
     mining industry both on the planet and the three
     planetoid belts in the system.  The metals mined on
     Atson are exported to most of the other systems in the
     subsector, in return for which they import the goods
     necessary to support the inhabitants, as well as the
     starships necessary to transport their cargo when
     necessary (since Atson doesn\'t have the technology to
     build them, Atson\'s clients usually hire independant
     carriers to transport the material).  They also import
     the technology necessary to run their class B starport,
     which is responsible for maintaining their in-system
     ships.

     The Atson society is about what you\'d expect from a
     mining town.  Although some structures extend into the
     underground, most of them are above-ground and
     connected by airtight slidewalks.  The people tend to
     be rather uncivilized.  Atson is a good place to go and
     disappear, which is why many of them are here.  In
     order to keep a lid on violence, guns and blades are
     controlled, although this law is not vigorously
     enforced and shootouts have been known to take place.
     A small pistol or blade is likely to go unnoticed by
     local law enforcement, whereas a rifle or serious
     combat weapon probably will not.

     The government of Atson is an impersonal bureaucracy
     whose main concern is keeping the business running.
     Its leader, Chief Director Francis (Frank) K. Murdock
     is himself a hedonistic, rough-cut individual who
     reportedly uses drugs recreationally.  Murdock\'s main
     goals are to keep business running smoothly and to keep
     everyone just happy enough to keep working.  The
     government rarely intervenes either for or against the
     people unless it significantly affects the mining
     operations.

     Security in and around the system is pretty tight.
     Mining is about the ONLY reason to be in Atson, and
     anyone that doesn\'t appear to be on official business
     is likely to be subject to a high degree of hassle.
     The government maintains an extensive fleet of shuttles
     and fighters for in-system operation.  It also
     maintains a system squadron consisting of 12 system
     defense boats, 2 destroyers, and 6 destroyer escorts.
     The SDB\'s typically patrol the system, while the
     destroyers and escorts are reserved for extreme
     situations, to be deployed separately or together as
     the situation demands.

     According to local history, Xhosa was a stronghold for
     advanced Imperial military units during the First
     Frontier War until a Zhodani naval detachment bombarded
     the planet with nuclear bombs and germ warfare.  The
     only current inhabitants are scholars combing the ruins
     for artifacts and trying to make the plant habitable
     again.  Not only is the planet dangerous with radioactivity
     and virii, but some strains of the virii have no known
     cure -- meaning anyone who catches them must be
     quarrantined on the planet for the rest of their lives.

     Nothing is as it appears.  Xhosa is actually the home
     system of a colony of immensely powerful and benevolent
     psionics and psychohistorians.  They foresaw the
     shattering of the Imperium decades before it occured,
     but still too late to avert it entirely.  They
     immediately began efforts to minimize the effects of
     the shattering and try to prevent another Long Night.
     They are still carrying out their plans.  The most
     prestigious among them are the Speakers, and the most
     powerful of them the First Speaker.  The stories about
     the radioactivity are only partially true -- the planet
     was once bombarded during the First Frontier War.  The
     stories about the virii are completely fabricated --
     designed to scare people away from actually visiting
     the planet.  Satellite beacons orbit the planet
     broadcasting warnings about this mythical virus.

     Unbeknownst to Norris, his right-hand man (the same one
     manipulating the PC\'s on his behalf) is also not only a
     member of this colony, but the First Speaker himself.
     (evil laughter....)  The First Speaker and the whole
     colony generally support Norris as a strong candidate
     to reunite the Imperium.  They would dearly like to get
     close enough to Strephon to determine whether or not he
     is truly alive, but none of them have been able to do
     it yet.

I be verra interested in ship plans.  I remember someone mentioning the
possibility of exchanging deck plans and so forth, was that you?  The call was
for votes on graphics format.  Well, knowing absolutely nothing about the
various graphics formats, I had nothing to contribute to the raging torrent of
discussion :).  I decided to just sit back and let the rest of you hack (& slash
   )
it out.
   Sigh.  Another good battle missed.  Anywho, I have since found out how to
with MacPaint or MacDraw files (I don\'t know what format those are in).  Also,
I have been told that TIFF is a good format to work with, although I don\'t know
what programs use that.
   So, I guess you could say my votes are for Postscript, MacPaint or MacDraw,
with a tenative vote for TIFF, if someone will tell me what to do with it when I
get it...:)  On the other hand, if the vote goes against me (how many votes now,

Bob?  three?  two?  one?  :) I am sure there is enough expertise at this
university to get me up and running in any format that the consensus agrees to.

	Sounds like a good idea, I would go ahead and write one but I am
too tied up with 10 million projects. I don\'t think anyone has done something
like this yet. As for the MT questions you posted a while ago, I believe
you meantioned something about what\'s the current edition for MT. I 
believe it\'s print 3. Open your player\'s manual and look inside cover,
if the number goes like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, you got 1st edition, if it says
2 3 4 5 6 7 etc , it\'s 2nd. And so on. By the way, I meant to reply to
your article, it was interesting to see MT from a new comer\'s point of view.
But as I stated before, I am just too tied up with 10 million things to do.

Good news: I have programs for making data files out of the tables, for
generating words, and for making a sort of dictionary.

Bad news: They\'re for a pocket machine called the Psion Organiser. It\'s been
around in the States, so some of you may have one. Its language is a sort of
hybrid between Pascal and Basic (don\'t flame me, flame Psion :-) and so may
be readable to you, but not to your machine. If anyone\'s interested, I\'ll try
to send the programs over, and you can try to convert them to some normal
language.

Just to remind the group, I currently have two software systems
to automatically generate star systems. The first (written by
James Perkins) is MegaTraveller compatible and allows you to
generate a single sector at a time (ASCII and PostScript output
are supported). The second program is written by Matt Burdick
<burdick@hpindzb> and generates "real" star systems (based upon
current astrophysical studies). If there is any interest in these 
progrtams, let me know and I\'ll email them to you (if there is
sufficient interest, I\'ll post them).

I look forward to hearing from anyone else who has public domain
or shareware software related to Traveller/MT. With any luck, this
will help supply the star system discussion group with something
to talk about and do. For the groups information, the last topic
of discussion was defining requirements for a program that would
generate anything from an entire sector down to a plantary map and
everything in between (ambitious? Yes,... :-).If anyone has any
discussion on the topic of star system generation, send them to 
me (Bill Morrison <morrison@pyr.gatech.edu>) and I\'ll collect all
the input, "digestify" the messages, and submit the digest to
the Traveller Mailing List.

Star system generation is usually a hot topic, but of late, traffic
on the topic has come to a sreeching halt. If you have anything to
say about Star System Databases, their generation, storage, and display,
I\'ll be glad to get your input.

I extend a heartfelt invitation to get together and swap impossible RPG
stories. You might want to catch me as I bulldoze a few parties in Near

find me through the nice folx at the Hyatt Regency.

Hope to see SOMEONE there!

Near Miss to one or the other group and get booted out on my arse? |->

 SUBJECT: GenCon

 Digest Group Publications WILL NOT have a booth at GenCon this year. The 
 only person from our staff to attend the con will be Gary Thomas. 
 Financially, it is stretching it a bit for us to attend two major 
 conventions in a year. If we attend a con in force, the expenses can eat 
 us alive. Our sales help defray the cost -- but our product line does 
 not yet have enough titles to justify going to both ORIGINS and GenCon 
 -- this year. We ARE planning to attend both ORIGINS and GenCon in 1990.

 However, even though DGP will not be at GenCon in force, our presence 
 will be very apparent:

 We are sponsering the RPGA MegaTraveller Tournament at GenCon this year.
 It\'s called "To kill an Archduke". (Sorry Scott, that\'s all I can say 
 right now...it would be unfair to say any more since this is an offical 
 GenCon tournament.)

 We, along with GDW, are producing a full-color promotional MegaTraveller 
 poster of Craig Farley\'s beautiful art that appears on the cover of 
 World Builder\'s Handbook. Make sure and get your poster -- they\'ll be at 
 the GDW booth and they\'re free. And, make sure your gaming dealer gets 
 one of these posters for his store. The idea with these posters is for 
 us all to use them to promote MegaTraveller. When new players join the 
 game, we all benefit by the growth.

A general question: Given ship stats, and a picture, as in the Rebellion

The specific project is the TJ-type Transport.  How big is the silly thing?
I know how much it displaces in liquid hydrogen, but that means little to
me in terms of size...  Am I missing something, or are there a number of
"correct" dimensions?

	One item that should be brought to the Digest Group\'s attention
is that the star does *not* go in the *center* of an elliptical orbit!
Rather, it goes at one of the *foci*. Among other things, this means
that closest approach is *opposite* farthest seperation, not 90 degrees
away from it.

I\'ll be putting together a letter to them about this, but they need to
know they goofed *soon*!

In case you are wondering where this comes from, take a long hard look
at the diagram on page 65 of _World Builder\'s Handbook_.

As for the Imperial Atlas data, it would appear that some (most?) of it
will be available early next year in machine readable format. See the

Generally, what I do is to first draw an interesting ship shape, with a
front view, top view, and right side view.  It is typically cobbled
together from half a dozen to a dozen roughly geometric shapes; wedges,
cones, hemi-spheres, cylinders, etc., with additional small ignorable
garbage.  I then guess at the rough dimensions that seem "right", from
my rough drawing.  Then I get out my mensuration formulae; i.e. volume
of a cone is 1/3 times the area of the base times the height; volume of
a sphere is 4/3 times pi times the radius squared, etc.  With the aid of
a good calculator, I determine what the actual volume of my drawing is
in cubic meters, and divide by 13.5 to get tons.  The ratio between my
rough-guess volume and the specification volume is the cube of the ratio
between my rough-guess dimensions and the accurate dimensions that would
reflect the specifications.  I adjust my overall dimensions accordingly.

Next, I split the plan into decks, at 3m-intervals.  Sometimes a ship is
"split-level", to optimize volume for deck space.  I then make slices
through my drawings at the deck levels, and copy them to graph paper, at
the correct scaling of 1.5m squares.  I detail the interior with all the
ship\'s components, then draw final, detailed plans of the exterior.

Fortunately, the "rules" permit 10-20% slop in a plan, so everything
generally comes out okay.  Unfortunately, desgning ships in this manner
requires a good understanding of basic algebra and geometry.

Responding to Adrian Hurt, RE: "plans" in the Rebellion Sourcebook:

These are not deck plans, just the same specs you find in the
rulebooks, in (old) supplements 7 & 9, etc.  I apologize for
not being more specific.


Responding to Jim Baranski, RE: Xhosa

When one of the largest worlds in the subsector also has
the lowest population, there has to be some explanation.
The world has a water supply and an atmosphere which is
breathable (albeit only with a filter mask).  It also
has a (frontier) starport.  It seemed obvious to me that
whoever these 90 people were, they had to be special.
I began searching for plausible explanations, and when
I thought of a group of psionic psychohistorians, I knew
that they fit perfectly into the "shattered imperium" setting.
Weren\'t the foundations formed to reunite a shattered imperium
of their own?

Granted, I could have come up with a more mundane explanation
had I worked at it, but I couldn\'t see any reason to do so when
this one fit the campaign so well and provided me with a major
instrument of mystery and manipulation.  You can imagine my
delight when I discovered that my primary PC (there is only
one at this point) had not read any of the Foundation books.
Now I\'m debating whether or not it would be too much of a dead
give-away to name the NPC I mentioned "Gendibal".

Sorry to take bandwidth with this but:
Today i recieved a letter (SnailMail) from something called the
Escape Ventures, POBox 4330, Virginia Beach VA
The only thing out of the ordinary with that was that the
envelope was opened and *empty*! Since there was no clue to the subject
of the letter on the envelope (I haven\'t the faintest idea
what "Escape Ventures" is!) i put out this notice.
If those who sent the letter,would please EMail me or repeat the letter.
And if anyone who have a clue what "Escape Ventures" could contact me,
I would be much obliged.

A commonly used fuel shuttle. It is well liked for its ability to protect
itself and for its all around ability. It is the only means of refuelling the
Shivva class frigate whom it can fully replenish in 8-9 runs.

The Aozpenj class lt fighter is the most commonly found Zhodani fighter. It is
rugged and well liked by its pilots except for its tight accomodations. It is
the primary fighter of the Shivva class patrol frigate.

Sorry for the delay in posting this ships I was out for a while.

Anyway here is the ubiquitious Shivva class Zho frigate. Further background
is in traveller adv \'Leviathan\' and \'Expedition to Zhodane\'. Will be posting the
fighter and shuttle forthwith. Note that ship relies on its shuttle for refuelling.
As always comments are welcome:

Before I go internet archive hopping, I\'d like to know if anyone
in this group has a shar file extraction tool/program for VMS.
We have a few people at VMS sites that can\'t extract the star 
system generation programs, which are in UNIX shar format. I\'d
rather find such a tool than send each of the files seperately.

Thanks.

The following is a weather generator for areas on earth like planets.  The 
parameters can be modified to suit your needs and the program could
probably be modified to fit any generally earth like world.

# unpacked will be owned by you and have default permissions.)

When playing roleplaying games (RPGs), it often adds some realism if the GM
can determine what kind of weather is occuring.  This program generates random
weather for a year that is tunable to various climates.  Several example
climates are included: north, south, and mid atlantic, gulf, and north
pacific.

In addition, several different calendars are included: Gregorian, medieval
Japanese, and the Middle Earth calendar detailed in the appendices of
Tolkien\'s The Lord of the Rings.

The details of these are provided so that the user can create his or her own
climate profiles or calendars.

Please send any improvements, new climate profiles, new calendars, or
better versions of the current climate profiles to one of the addresses below.

[Let\'s try this again -- James]

A few messages back somebody was discussing vehicles... I didn\'t have
much to contribute to that conversation, but it got me thinking (always
a dangerous condition :-) about something I was interested in awhile
back when I played Traveller more actively.  Namely, vehicle design
rules and vehicular combat.  Now, I know that striker has rules for
both design and combat, altthough they are more oriented towards tanks
and such than civilian vehicles.  There was an article in one of the
TASJs about designing civilian vehicles with Striker rules.
 
	What I\'m interested in is rules to handle designing normal
civilian vehicles and even armored and/or heavily armed civilian
vehicles, plus rules for combat with them, with only a few vehicles
instead of many.  Of course a system that could handle both ends of the
scale, military and civilian, many and few, would be just as fine.  So
the question is, does such a system exist?  I\'m totally unfamiliar with
the new rules, so I don\'t know if they have anything useful.  I\'m not a
Striker aficianado, so if there\'s one out there, can that system be
tweaked sufficiently to handle what I\'m talking about? 
 
	I used to play car wars a bit, and we even cobbled up a
simplistic conversion for car wars style combat in a traveller universe
(the GM liked CW also, and much of our gaming took place on a world
suited to the genre).  I\'d like a good set of rules to handle this
stuff, and am open to suggestions.  While I\'m at it, a good car battle
game to replace car wars would be nice too... (something very
high-techish, but flexible enough to use with other systems would be
PERFECT!)

	Uhmmm... Mac, it\'s not that I don\'t appreciate the response, but
I\'m not about to go blow $$$$ on Megatraveller when I have no likelihood 
of being involved in campaign any time this year.  Could you expand on 
this answer?  How well does the vehicular design and combat system work?
Is it suitable for single, civilian vehicles as well as multiple military
vehicles?  What kind of action happens with the combat?  How fast can a
vehicle be designed, and how quickly does the action move once in combat?
What range of vehicles can be designed?  What technologies are allowed?
Can you give me some samples of a short combat or vehicle design?  I\'m
all eyes, hit me with your best shot (to mix two cliches :-)

	The process of designing a vehicle is, well a bit too long. First,
you choose a hull design, and decide its size and configuration and armor.
Power supply comes next, then locomotion, communication, sensors and 
electronics, weapons if you want, screens if you want, bridge if needed, 
accommodations, and fuel. The system was designed in a way so that you can
use it to create vehicles, starships, or small crafts. The only thing I don\'t
really like is that it took a long time just to create a craft of any kind.

	You can design crafts of any kind up to Tech level 21.

	As for combat, well vehicle combat is covered in the personal combat
section, a vehicle is not very different from a person in combat except
it has more firepower/armor. The combat between two vehicles doesn\'t take
any longer than the combat between two people, thanks to the task system.
You can use civilan vehicles in the combat, too. It just can\'t fire back,
that\'s all. What kind of actions occur in combat? Well, you can fire,
you can evade, or intrupt someone else\'s turn if your turn go before his.
Image, tank A is fighting against B and C. A is aimming B ready to fire, but
C goes first. Thus C decides to perform a intrupt on A, (the form of intrupt
is up to you, you can fire or whatever. As long as it\'s something that A can\'t
ingnor. If you succed hitting A and push it aside. A lost it\'s turn, and B is
safe.) Using the combat system, I have done as many as 15 vehicles combat
without dragging it down...

> 	The process of designing a vehicle is, well a bit too long...

	Hmm... I see what you mean.  But surely you can cut certain steps
out depending upon what kind of vehicle you\'re designing?  Or make the
answers "standard" for a certain class of vehicle.  I agree with you, it
sounds great, perhaps I can get my traveller-playing cousin (hello there
David) to buy the system so I can look at it :-)  Then he can play traveller
and I can autoduel and we\'ll both be happy :-)

> 	You can design crafts of any kind up to Tech level 21.

	Sounds fun... what kind of options are at that level?  Hmmm...
for that matter, I don\'t recall much in the old system being above TL16,
aside from a little chart that had vague things like "anti-matter power"
or "personal disintegrator weapons" or "teleportation" etc.

> 	As for combat, well vehicle combat is covered in the personal combat

	Hmmm... this doesn\'t sound perfect.  I realize that ground vehicles
(Cars) are a relatively small portion of the spectrum of vehicles possible,
but do they all move the way human beings do?  Or are there accel/deccel
rules and such?  From what\'s been said, I suspect that "grafting" on an
adaptation of such rules might work well.

> between two people, thanks to the task system.

	How does this task system work?  I\'ve seen various "task systems"
for skills-based RPGs, basically a basic skill plus modifiers for conditions.
Is this similar, or more involved?
 
	Thanks for all of the information.  This is sounding like a more
attractive system the more I hear about it!  (Now if only I had the cash...
anybody know anybody who needs a decent tech writer?  How about an FRPG
writer? :-)

> How well does the vehicular design and combat system work?

Slowly, arduously.  It helps to have a spreadsheet so you can trade off
options.  Naturally, it takes a long time to set up your calculator.

> Is it suitable for single, civilian vehicles as well as multiple military
> vehicles?

Yes, the combat system works for everything.  Civilian vehicles just tend to
have lousy armor and no weapons.

> What kind of action happens with the combat?

Being an armchair MT reader, and not having exercised this, I bow to the
knowledge of other, more-experienced MT refs.

> How fast can a
> vehicle be designed, and how quickly does the action move once in combat?

I\'d guess at about 4 hours, maybe half-an-hour with a pre-completed
spreadsheet.

> What range of vehicles can be designed?  What technologies are allowed?

Anything you can imagine and that you can stuff into your hull.

> Can you give me some samples of a short combat or vehicle design?

Some samples?  Okay, here\'s a ground car from p. 76 of the Imperial
Encycopedia:

				Ground Car
	CraftID:	Ground Car, TL 5, Cr5600
	Hull:		2/5, Disp = 2, Config = 4 USL, Armor = 4B,
			Unloaded = 8.2tons, Loaded = 9.9tons
	Power:		1/2, IntCombust = 0.3Mw, Duration = 0.2/0.6
	Loco:		1/2, Wheels Road = 85 kph, OffRoad = 30 kph
	Commo:		None (some have a radio receiver)
	Sensors:	None
	Off/Def:	HardPoints = 1
	Control:	Panel = Mechanical, Environ = basic env
	Accomm:		Crew = 1 (Operator = 1), Seats = cramped x 6
	Other:		Cargo = 1.5kliters, Fuel = 2.1kliters, ObjSize = small,
			EMLevel = faint
	The ground car is an ordinary self-powered vehicle suitable for use
	in civilized areas on low-tech worlds.

The above UCP (Universal Craft Profile) is arrived at via a long and
tortured design method.  Unfortunately some of the numbers seem a little
silly.  8.2 tons (0-100kph in only 125 seconds)! 2100 liters of fuel
(500 gallons)? Come on! Maybe these are covered in the MT errata.

	TL 21? Well, I can\'t go through the book and list everything.
But anti-matter, and TL21 Avionics comes to mind. Jump damper is also interesting. Most of the TL21 stuff are for starships, though.

	As for movment, each vehicle has a movment point base on its speed.
And it\'s up to you to use the movement point in anyway you like. Thus
takes care of the Accl/Deccel part. It\'s not perfect, but then nothing is.

	Task system, well. A task could be simple, routine, difficult, or
formidable. Simple is 3+ on 2d6, routine 7+ on 2d6, difficult 15+,
formidable 17+. Skills can serve as pluses to the roll, characterics/6 can
also serve as pluses. The point is, this is no ordinary simple one skill 
based task sort of thing in other games. It\'s actully complete and makes
the game run a lot smoother.

Cosmos Number 9

A Trav variant 

_________________________________________________________________________

Psionics in Cosmos

1.0 General rule descriptions

1.1 Mental Origin of Psionics

All self conscious entities have a psionic power derived from their
consciousness.  The powers are derived partly from conscious activity
and partly from unconscious activity.  Psionics are a product of
"recursive mental identification and are divided into active and
passive modes.

Psionics in their passive mode are a product of "recursive like"
machine intelligence (as the most primitive mechanism).  These devices
can be used to distort, dampen or enhance an active psionic entity.
Examples of primitive passive devices are psionic shields on a star
cruiser or a psionic power boosting entity.

1.2 Timing of Psionics

Psionics operate at the speed of light.  Even those very rare
disciplines that operate on time and space still adhere to this
limitation.  Thus if psionics are used in a melee round they will go
off simultaneously with first action.  Note: rare psionics may have
cause and effect that transcend the speed of light and time, but the
local operation of the talent is at the speed of light.

1.3 Active Psionics

Active psionics are divided into 4 conditions: Psionic Base (PSI),
Psionic Strength (PSS), Psionic Resistance (PSR) and Psionic Skill
Level.

For life forms that do not have strength or endurance it is based on
the raw power of their "nervous system" (living machine intelligence
for example).

1.3.1 Psionic Base (PSI)

PSI is the entities basic psionic potential to effect mental-to-mental
casuality in the time space continuum.  For the number of dice see
specific species.  For humanoids the PSI roll is 2D.

1.3.2 Psionic Resistance (PSR)

PSR is computed: (PSI) * 2 + END + INT.  

PSR represents the entities ability to resist probing and attacking
psionic entities.

1.3.3 Psionic Strength (PSS)

PSS is computed: (PSI) * 2 + END + STR

PSS represents the entities ability to exercise active psionics.

1.3.4 Psionic Skill Level

The psionic skill operates like any other skill. The differences are
the effects that are involved.  Any entity with a skill level of
Psionics-0 or greater is said to be psionically active.

1.4 Psionic Awaking

An entity is awakened (with the possibility of gaining Psionics-0 as a
skill) by being exposed to psionic attack or manipulation.  Very basic
rule: use of psionics breeds psionics.  To see if the entity is
awakened a save must be made against their Psionic Base (PSI) on 3D-3
(a roll lower than PSI constitutes a success).

1.4.1 Automatic Awakening

An entity with a PSI of 16 ("G" in Travllerese) is automatically
awaked when exposed to the awakening incident.

1.4.2 Number of Awakening Attempts

An entity makes a save on PSI on EACH awakening incident until
awakened.  There can be no more than one incident per melee round.

1.4.3 Six Major Talent Disciplines 

Once awakened the entity can intuitively "feel" the six major psionic
disciplines:

	Telepathy
	Telekenesis
	Teleportation
	Telurgy
	Clairvoyance
	Body Control

1.4.4 Other Disciplines

Other disciplines do exist, but are not intuitively obvious to the
newly awakened entity.

1.5 Learning Psionics

The now psionically active adept can learn on their own or with an
instructor.  The learning process is obviously more difficult solo.

1.5.1 Multiple Skill Training

Mundane skill learning process is directly associated to the current
Technical Level.  Learning psionics can take place at the SAME TIME
while studying a mundane skill but they adept may not study another
non-mundane "meta-skill" (Force Magic for instance) while studying
psionics.  The adept can study NOTHINGNESS (a mundane "anti-skill" or
"null skill") while studying psionics.

The adept entity when studying psionics can study a talent discipline
or level but not both.

1.5.2 Timed Required to Study

Unlike Tech Level associated skills the time required to for study is
invariant.  It is always 45 20 hour days.

1.5.3 Successfully Gaining a Level

Psionic skill levels are gained in psionics just like any other skills
and do operate independently of the disciplines.  Thus the psionic
skill level of a character represents the general ability of the
character and the discipline orders represent the specific
applications of those skills.  Needless to say the higher the entities
psionic skill level the easier it will be for it to learn the
disciplines.  A psionically awaked entity cannot learn a discipline
talent higher than their current psionic skill level.

Psionic levels go in sequence like all other skills (Psionics-0;
Psionics-1; and so on).

The following roll must be made on 2D where success is greater than or
equal to the computed number:

[7 + (psionic skill level) - (instructors skill level) - (number of 
times skill level attempted and failed)

For example: Mumblefrotz has Psionics-2 and is trying to get
Psionics-3.  He has failed 2 times at this skill level and his
instructor has Instruct-2 with a successful make.  Thus Mumblefrotz
needs:

[7 + (3) - (2) - (2)] or greater than or equal to 6 on 2D.

1.5.4 Successfully Gaining a Talent

The following roll must be made on 2D where success is greater than or
equal to the computed number:

[7 + (current psionic talent level) - (psionic skill level) -
(instructors skill level) - (number of times talent attempted and failed)

The "current psionic talent level" is the level of the talent within
the discipline under study.  Note a character with Psionics-2 can study
a level-1 talent within a (new or already known) discipline (and find
it easier to learn).  A psionic talent cannot be greater than the
adepts psionic skill level.

For example; Mumblefrotz now has Psionics-3 and has a number of
talents within the telepathy discipline and decides to start leaning
talents within the telekenesis discipline.  He must learn the Mass
Movement talent which is a level-1 talent without the aid of an
instructor.  He has never studied and failed at this talent. Thus
Mumblefrotz needs:

[7 + (1) - (3) - (0) - (0)] or greater than or equal to 5 on 2D.

Talents MUST be gained in the order that they are in the discipline

1.5.5 Criticals and Fumbles

If the instructor criticals the Instruction skill the task will be
learned by the learner on any roll except an unrecovered fumble
against learners psionic skill level (a natural 2 on 2D followed by a
failed skill level make).

1.6 Using a Psionic Talent

1.6.1 Active or Attacking Actions by the Adept

To use a psionic skill the adept must roll greater than

[7 + (psionic talent level] - (psionic skill level) on 2D.

If the roll fails (and an unrecovered fumble was not made), the adept
can expend additional Psionic Strength points to bring the use of the
talent up to the necessary level.

1.6.2 Passive or Defenders Actions

If the object or entity of the action or attack has no Psionic
Resistance (PSR) then the action is automatically successful. If there
is a passive or defending PSR then a comparison of PSS vrs. PSR is
made on the 2 serial dice resolution matrix.  The active entity
(attacker(s)) rolls vrs the number on the table and if their PSS
successfully overcomes the defenders PSR.

Discussion: A resistance vrs. resistance roll is made (Column vrs.
row).  For the resistance to be overcome the "attacker" or the row
wants to roll low.  To determine the number needed compare the number
below the rows index with that of the columns index.  For the row to
be successful this number or less must be rolled on 2 D serial.  "**"
counts as either 36 or 41.  If a true difference is needed roll a 3rd
D as an indicator.  "+0, +1, +2" are automatic additional units of
strength and "-0, -1, -2" are automatic units of loss if the
difference between row and column is sufficient.  "A" is 10, "K" is
20.  If the distance between the indices is "L" or 21 then the units
of additional loss/strength is -3, ad infinitum.

Reminder: Overcoming PSS is not the same as eliminating PSS by using
the appropriate talent.

1.6.4 Result of Active Success

On a success the talent is successful and the passive entity or
defenders PSR and attackers PSS is reduced by the level number of the
talent and points used to make the basic skill roll(note some talents
could require additional PSS points).

For example if Mumblefrotz uses a 2nd level talent successfully this
removes 2 PSS points to be regained later. (Note most talents allow
the adept to use additional PSS points to enhance the effect of the
talent).

1.6.5 Result of Active Failure

When the active entities PSS fails to over come the passive PSR then
all PSS points for this action are lost until regained later.

1.6.6 Non Living Objects

It is possible for non-living objects like a starship or battle armor
to have a shield with PSR due to recursive psionic feedback.  It must
be overcome like any other PSR.

1.6.7 Regenerating PSS and PSR

PSS and PSR are both regained simultaneously according to the
following formula:

(16 - END) * 0.5 (round fractions up) hours per point regained.

Example: Mumblefrotz has an END of 12 (C); (16 - 12) * 0.5 = 2 or
1 point of PSR and PSS is regained every two hours.  For entities
without END substitute SIZ in cubic meters for END.

For entities of SIZ or END greater than or equal to 16 the time in 
hours to regenerate 1 point of PSS and PSR is calculated according
to the following formula:

1 / 2 * (END - 15)

Example: Helen Heaven has END of 17; 1 / 2 * (17 - 15) or she 
regenerates 1 point of PSS and PSR every 15 minutes.

1.6.8 Multiple Nervous Systems

An entity with more than one brain or nervous system will have two
or more distinct set of statistics for Psionics.

1.6.9 Nothingness Skill

The NOTHINGNESS anti(null) skill negates all incoming psionics save
critical usages.  A critical NOTHINGNESS will negate incoming critical
usages of psionics.

1.6.10 PSS costs under the Talents

The costs of various effects listed under the talents are in PSS
formulas.  The effects must be generated using separate PSS points.
That is, expenditure of PSS on range will not buy duration and so on.

3.0 First Level Talents

3.0.0 Telepathy Discipline

3.0.1 Lifesense

The adept can detect the presense of living beings though their mental
auras.  The range of the talent is:

10meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points
spent)

successful the general nature of the creatures will be known.  That is
the number and approximate distance.  The adept does NOT have to over
come the beings PSR to know that they are there.  Lifesense does NOT
constitute a psionic attack.

3.0.2 Mind Shield

This is a permanent skill that alerts the adept to psionic probing.
Once learned the skill has two natural states: rigid and non-rigid.

3.0.2.0 Non-rigid Mind Shield

The non-rigid mind shield has the following attribute: the adept will
automatically detect any psionics and will have the opportunity to
immediately go from non-rigid to rigid mode.  The non-rigid mind
shield is in effect if the adept is conscious or unconscious and still
living (that is, it is permanent once learned).

3.0.2.1 Rigid Mind Shield

When the adept raises a rigid mind shield, points can be spent from
PSS and put into PSR.  They will remain there until PSS is
regenerated.  The adept cannot prevent the later transfer of enhanced
PSR back to PSS with this talent.  The number of PSRs is generated
directly  from the number of PSS points expended.

The adept MAY use other talents when screens are rigid.  A critical
roll will allow the adept to gage the quantity of incoming attacks or
probes.

3.0.3 Empathetic Contact

The adept can send a message with a single meaning to another being.
The message is open to misinterpretation and can be resisted.  If
resisted the beings PSR must be overcome and the message will be
understood as the adept wished.  The range of the message is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

A successful empathetic contact will tell adept something of the mood
of the contact if it is capable of emotion.  If PSR is overcome, the
use of this talent constitutes a psionic attack.

3.1.0 Telekenesis Discipline

3.1.1 Mass Movement

The adept can move objects a certain mass using this ability without
touching them.  A successful role will mean that the object can be
moved at:

1 meter * (psionic skill level)

See Telekenetic Level/PSS cost table below to determine PSS
expenditure effect:

The adept can combine the effect of mass movements with other adepts.
The talent may be applied to the adept themselves so to enable
"flight".  If a being is being moved against its will it constitutes a
psionic attack

3.1.2 Manipulation

The adept has the ability to manipulate small objects such as knobs,
switches or other similar objects as if fingers or other similar
dextrous organs were being used.  Cost in weight is also computed on
Telekenetic Level/PSS cost table.  Additional non PSIONIC skill rolls
may be required to manipulate an object.  The time required to
manipulate an object is:

round * (Psionic skill level) per point of PSS

3.1.3 Sound

The adept has the capacity to vibrate a section of air (or
atmosphere), thin metal or like object.  The adept must sense the
object vibrating.  The object size that is vibratable is equal to cost
on Telekenetic Level/PSS cost table.  The time required to vibrate the
object is:

round * (Psionic skill level) per point of PSS

3.2.0 Clairvoyance Discipline

3.2.1 Sense Danger

The adept has a heightened awareness of potential danger.  The adept
must actively sense the danger.  Sensing the danger of another psionic
being normally does not constitute a psionic attack.  The range of the
sense is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

As the adept moves closer to the danger the feeling will be stronger
(thus allowing the adept to use multiple sense dangers to identify the 
source).

3.2.2 Locate danger

The adept can attempt to locate the general direction of a possible
danger once alerted.  The range to locate the danger is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

3.3.0 Telurgy Discipline

3.3.1 Mind Shield

In all respects this is identical to the first level Telepathy skill.

3.3.2 Strength

The telurgic adept increases the characteristics of their strength one
of two ways: permanently by using a point psionic base (PSI) or
temporarily using psionic strength points (PSS).  In each case the
formula for success is the same:

The following roll must be made on 2D where success is greater than or
equal to the computed number:

(3D - 3 - STR) + (current psionic talent level) - (psionic skill level) -
(instructors skill level) - (number of times talent attempted and failed)

3.4.0 Body Control Discipline

3.4.1 FTL Shock Control

Allow the adept to protect themselves from the rigors of faster than
light travel.  There is not cost in PSS to activate the skill.

3.5.0 Teleportation Discipline

3.5.1 Teleport

Allows the adept to teleport an object (including the adept them
selves) instantaneoulsy (FTL but not in time) from source to
destination according to the following formula and table:

For distance:

1 kilometer * [(psionic skill level) * (teleport discipline level) * 
(each point of PSS expended for distance) - (non-psionic obstruction
rating of teleport destination)]

Use Teleportation discipline Level per PSS cost table below to determine
PSS expenditure effect for mass:

A non psionic obstruction can be dense material and/or a gravitational
field.  Each G in the gravitational field rates as a point of psionic
obstruction (round up).  Each 36 physical defense points of armor or
hull density or similar dense material count as a point of obstruction
(round up).  Optimal teleporting conditions exist in Zero-G
environments.  Another non-psionic obstruction is unfamiliarity of the
destination by the adept.  This can rate as negative (very familiar)
to several points of obstruction (destination totally unknown).

A failed teleport always returns the adept the source where they
started.

4.0 Second Level Talents

4.0.0 Telepathy Discipline

4.0.1 Mind Touch

The adept is able to probe the surface thoughts of another sentient
being.  The base roll to be successful is dependent on the difficulty
rating of the thoughts probed. If resisted the beings PSR must be
overcome then the surface thoughts can be read.  The range of the mind
touch talent is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

Unless a critical roll is made the skill the talent will not read
subconscious thoughts.  Use of this skill usually constitutes a psionic
attack.

4.0.2 Suggestion

This talent is similar to the first level talent Empathetic Contact in
that the adepts own mood us first impressed on the subject.  Then the
adept can suggest a simple two word or two "syntax" phrase that does
not contradict the beings fundamental nature or well being.  Examples
might be "walk slow" or "<in-the-continuum-that-your-energy-is-in>
<enlarge>".  If resisted the beings PSR must be overcome and the
suggestion will be understood and acted upon. The range of the
suggestion is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

Use of this talent always constitutes a psionic attack.

4.0.2 Mental Attack

Allows the adept to directly attack another beings PSR.  Obviously the adept 
must first overcome the target beings PSR.  Then the adept can elliminate the
target beings PSR as per:

(psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent) - (target beings
psionic skill level)

The range of the mental attack is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

The target will regain PSR according to PSS regeneration formula.

A psionic attack.

4.0.3 Stun

Allows the adept to directly attack another beings END.  As with all
attacks the target beings PSR must be overcome.  Then the adept can
elliminate the target beings END.  The target beings END loss is always
equal to the psionic level of the adept (always at least 2).  The cost
for the effect of this talent in PSS is also equal to the psionic
level of the adept.  The range of stun is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

A psionic attack.

4.1.0 Telekenesis Discipline

4.1.1 Mass Movement

(see 3.1.1 for description)

4.1.2 Soft Speak

The adept can use sound so a message can be whispered in the ear of
the intended subject.  The number of words in the whispered message
is:

(psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

The range of the message is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

Use of this talent does not constitute a psionic attack.

4.1.3 Telekenetic Blow

Allows the adept to hurl an object so as to do physical or bashing
damage.  The size in kilograms and the amount of damage done is equal
to the psionic skill level of the adept.  The range of the blow is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

The advantage of this talent over other offensive talents is that
because the attack is physical it does not constitute a psionic attack.
attack.

4.2.0 Clairvoyance Discipline

4.2.1 Far See

This talent will allow the adept to gain an approximate characteristic
of a location that is in line of sight vision.  The clarity of the
talent is a function of the difficulty, range, skill level and psionic
strength of the adept.  The clarity in X power is:

(psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent) / (difficulty level)

Difficulty would be smoke, fog and so on.

The range of the farsee is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

Living beings within the area of farsee are not under psionic attack.

4.2.2 Detect Psi

This talent allows a great sensitivity to psionics in the adept.  Use
of the talent will allow the adept to detect the emination, alteration
or usage of psionics.  The range of detect psionics is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

Use of this talent does not constitute a psionic attack.

4.2.3 Sense Molecular

Allows the adept to sense the molecular chemical makeup within the
range of the talent.  Useful for sensing water, poison and the like.
The sensing will give the molecular makeup but not atomic or subatomic
information.  The range of sense molecular is:

10 meters * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

Normally not a psionic attack.

4.3.0 Telurgy Discipline

4.3.1 Endurance

The telurgic adept increases the characteristics of their endurance one
of two ways: permanently by using a point psionic base (PSI) or
temporarily using psionic endurance points (PSS).  In each case the

5.0.1 Telepathy

This talent allows the adept to communicate with other sentient beings
over a considerable distance.  The it is effectively a face to face
conversion.  There are four modes to telepathic conversation with
another sentience: conversation with a psionically unactivated being,
conversation with a willing psionic, conversation with a willing
psionic that has the telepathy talent and conversation with an
unwilling psionic.  The distance for a conversation with a psionically
unactivated being and with a psionically resisting beings is:

10Km * (psionic skill level) * (number of PSS points spent)

The distance with a psionically activated being is effectively doubled.

10Km * (senders psionic skill level) * (senders number of PSS points
spent) * 10Km * (receivers psionic skill level) * (receivers number of
PSS points spent).

The time in 6 second rounds that telepathy is in effect is similar to range

are revealed to the adept is equal to the adepts psionic level.  It is
also the number of PSS points expended per session.  The frequency of
the number of sessions the adept has with an object is:

(36 20 hour days + number of previous sessions with object by adept) / 
(psionic level + PSS points expended)

can be called a transcorporal being.  Depending on the beings former
cultural patterns a number of events can take place.  Psionics will
blur and combine with Force Science (Magic).  The now transformed
being can effectively operate with tech level 30 or greater societies
where energy and matter are transformed instantaneously over space and
maybe even time.  The transformed being may approach tech level 40 a
go completely outside the time space continuum of all time lines
before the Big Bang and after the Big Suck.  Former reality will not
be forgotten but remain a dream like memory.  Perhaps the MetaPsionic
will meet other wandering MetaPsionics and have cosmic encounters on a
new scale.

BigBang into non-time and then back into time again on the League
Cosmos time line.

12.1.0 1st Level Talents

12.1.1 Tell Time

This talent allows the adept to "feel" mathematically correct time
within accuracy:

(1 second / (psionic skill level)) / (number of PSS points spent)

12.1.2 Know Age

This talent allows the adept to accurately estimate the age of object.
The adept must be aware of the object to estimate its age (for
example, a microbe).

12.1.3 Photographic Recall

This talent allows photographic recall of an event in memory that has
happened in the past.

12.2.0 2nd Level Talents

12.2.1 Teleport

(see 3.5.1 for description)

12.2.2 Predict event

Will allow the adept to predict the chance of a particular event
happening on the current timeline and possibly its derivatives.  The
basic chance to predict an event is 4 * (psionic level) on a scale 
of 1 to 36.  

12.2.3 Slow entropy

The adept is able to slow entropic processes but not stop them.  The
effect is on the flow of EUNITs in the immediate and far cosmos (see
Technology Levels for a discussion of EUNITs).  The range for slow
entropy is:

10meters * (psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)

The number of EUNITs slowed is:

.1 * (Tech Level culture of adept) * (psionic skill level) * (number PSS
points spent)

What a bizarre talent!

12.3.0 3rd Level Talents

12.3.1 Teleport

(see 3.5.1 for description)

12.3.2 Slow Down my Body

Creates a temporal field around the adepts body or cellular structure
to make it slower.  The 6 second ration effect is:

(6 seconds) * (psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)

12.3.2 Speed Up my Body

Creates a temporal field around the adepts body or cellular structure
to make it faster.  The 6 second ration effect is:

(6 seconds) /[(psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)]

12.4.0 4th Level Talents

12.4.1 Teleport

(see 3.5.1 for description)

12.4.2 Area Effect Slow Down

Like 12.3.2 except an area of effect is associated to this talent:

10 square centimeters * (psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)

12.4.2 Area Effect Speed Up

Like 12.3.3 except an area of effect is associated to this talent:

10 square centimeters * (psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)

12.5.0 5th Level Talents

12.5.1 Timeport Current Timeline

This talent allows the adept to teleport through time on the current
time line.  This would include bifurcations and recombinations where
possible.  The length of the timeport in years is:

360day year * (psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)

See 3.5.1 for a description of PSS expenditure for mass on time port.

12.5.2 Stasis

Continual Timeport Current Timeline to same point in time.  The
number of "times" the adept may use this talent to "loop" is:

(psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)

12.6.0 6th Level Talents

12.5.1 Timeport Different Timeline

The talent is similar to Timeport Current Timeline (12.5.1) except the
adept can attempt to time port to a different timeline.  Exactly where
and on which timeline the adept will end up on is somewhat asynchronous 
and indeterminate.  That is the distance from the "beginning of time"
is is the same on the other timeline, not the same equivalent event.

12.7.0 7th Level Talents

12.7.1 Forsee Event on current time line

Like 12.2.2 except chance scale is 36 out of 36 (chance to see event
is 100% if psionics skill roll is made).

12.7.2 Sense Timeline

Bifurcations from the BigBang and Convergences to the BigSuck are
sensed and traversed.  As the adept travels these timelines the
absolute number of years travelled is:

1Million * (psionic skill level) * (number PSS points spent)

The adept can continue sensing timelines from where the last sense
timeline left off.  The adept does NOT travel the timelines while
sensing them.

12.8.0 8th Level Talents

12.8.1 Forsee Event on parallel time lines

Like 12.7.1 except the talent works on alternate parallel timelines.

12.8.2 Alter Time

Using this talent the adept is able to alter events on a timeline
without creating a new timeline (fundamentally changing the past and
future).

12.9.0 9th Level Talents

12.9.1 Parallel Timeport

The Adept is similar to Timeport Different Timeline (12.5.1) except
that the adept can timeport the same associated event (if it exists)
on a different parallel timeline.

12.9.2 Create Timeline

Allows the adept to create (yet another) alternate past and future in
a controlled manner.

12.9.3 Metapsionics

(see MetaPsionics 12.0)

Really silly subject line, eh?
I have a question to the members of TML that i will try to explain below:
How closly shall the parts of traveller that depicts parts of our real
world follow said real world?
The background behind the question is this: I recently bought the COACC
(Close Orbit and Airspace Control Command) sourcebook for MegaT, And while
as a whole, the bok was as expected (No more errors and omissions and
unclear points than usual :-) there was one thing that struck me as strange
In the chapter about Aircraft Maintainance there was a taskroll for refueling
an a/c (airCraft :-) that said like this:

	To fuel an aircraft:
	Simple, Dexterity, 2 min, (hrzadous, unskilled OK)
	Referee: If a fumble failure occurs, static electricity ignites
     a fire leading to an explosion in 3D seconds. The aircraft and possibly
     any neighbouring aircraft are destroyed by the explosion. The Character/
     NPC refueling the aircraft is killed unless he is at least 20 meters
     from the fire when the explosion occurs
     (My apologies for broken copyrights)

According to the rules, a fumble mishap occurs when you make a throw of 2
with the 2D. Statistically this happens 1/36 (one time in 36). That is:
every 36th time you fuel an a/c it explodes ?!
(As a byline I can mention that I personally have refueled jettrainers
on at least 240 occations (4times a day 5days a week for 3 months, while
doing conscript service in the Royal Swedish Air Force). And no explosion
ever happend, even though I *did* manage a major fumble and got showered
with jet-fuel )
In reality jet-fuel is quite hard to set fire to: It behaves more like
kerosene than gasoline, The *really* scary stuff is high octane prop-plane
fuel, Higly volatile and equally flammable. 
Thus my question:
Shall traveller follow reality or is there a reason to keep the xploding
aircraft rule on the grounds of game balance or something like that?
Comments on this case, the question in general and other cases are welcome.
Mail to me, or if interesting to the TML, mail there.

I don\'t state this question because I have a desire to tamper with the
game system. It\'s just that in this case the results are so totally ludicrous
that I feel that I have so speak out. Imagine for example a mercenary air
squadron that looses one a/c in 36 because it explodes while being refueled?!
They would go bust in notime.

Here is my suggestion for refueling tasks:

	To refuel a ramjet, turbojet, turboprop or turbofan a/c:
	Simple, Dexterity, 2min (hazardous, Unskilled OK)
	Referee: If a fumble mishap occurs, roll on the mishap table:
    Destroyed: a/c catches fire, Major: a/c catces fire if engine has been
    running within the last 10 min. (ie engine still hot).
    Minor or less: Fuel on the tarmac or somebody got a shower
    (The latter could be fatal if that somebody is an officer :-)

	To refuel a propeller, rocket or fusion rocket a/c:
	Simple, Dexterity, 2min (hazardous, Unskilled OK)
	Referee: If a fumble mishap occurs, roll on the mishap table:
    Destroyed: a/c explodes immediately (fatal within 20 meters),
    Major: a/c catches fire. Minor or less: as for jet a/c:s
	Note: If the a/c is rocketpowered and TL 7- this task becomes:
	Routine, Dexterity, Mechanic, 2min (hazardous)
	(Cryogenic fuels (Liquid oxygen and hydrogen) are extremely
	unpleasant to handle)

If the a/c catches fire throw 1D every round, on a 5+ the a/c will explode.
Remember that fuzed munitions may cook off and explode.

	To put out a a/c on fire:
	Difficult, OFF=(Highest dexterity, +1 per participating person), 
	 DEF=( -1 per previous round on fire), 1 cmbt rnd (absolute,
	 hazardous, fateful)
	Referee: Every participating person must have a flame extinguisher
    and be on the site of the fire to be included. Any mishaps mean that
    injuries has been sustained. Attempt this task once per round until
    the fire is put out (or the a/c explodes)

Whoa!  Jump back, Mac!  :)   Simple is 3+, routine 7+, difficult is 11+ not 15,

On another note, has anyone out there seen the World Builder\'s Handbook?  I
remember hearing discussion of it, but our local gaming/bookstores don\'t have
it yet.  Just wondering if the discussion was about a beta version or what?
Also, if it\'s not out yet, any official anticipated date from GDW as to when
it will be in the stores?

How about the Alien Modules?  Any date on when those will be available?

Discussion of refueling aircraft...

>According to the rules, a fumble mishap occurs when you make a throw of 2
>with the 2D. Statistically this happens 1/36 (one time in 36). That is:
>every 36th time you fuel an a/c it explodes ?!

   Sounds like an awful lot of explosions to me.  Anyone out there have
   U.S. Airforce experience to add to the Swedish experience?  Does this
   sound about right?

>In reality jet-fuel is quite hard to set fire to: It behaves more like
>kerosene than gasoline, The *really* scary stuff is high octane prop-plane
>fuel, Higly volatile and equally flammable.

   From what little I know of Jet fuel, I would tend to agree with you.

>Shall traveller follow reality or is there a reason to keep the xploding
>aircraft rule on the grounds of game balance or something like that?

   I don\'t have any contacts with GDW so I\'ll have to leave that question
   up to the people who do have contacts.  Anyone care to throw the
   question at them?  :)

>Here is my suggestion for refueling tasks:
(several suggested tasks follow)

   Never having had ANY experience refueling aircraft, I have  only one
   question...
   Can an aircraft of any type be completely refueled in only 2 minutes?
   This seems too low to me, especially if we are talking about hundreds of
   gallons at a time.  Are they *REALLY* high speed pumps or what?

Hi gang. Metlay here, back from GenCon 1989 in Milwaukee. So what\'s to 
report?

Well, the Con was well attended and ran smoothly. As always, the single 
biggest hassle was in obtaining onsite event registration (line lengths on the 
average of one hour or more), and everything else went smoothly. I didn\'t see 
any other List readers there, but what th\'hey. Big sellers were FASA\'s new
SHADOWRUN game and everything else in their line, and Palladium and Leading 
Edge also made a very strong showing. Big hits of the Con were the MIDIMaze 
Interactive Combat Synthesizer and the FASA BattleTech display. Imagine a 
video game where every piece on the board is being run by a live player, who 
can think, move, and attack in real time! Both games offered this capability, 
and each had its strong points. The MIDIMaze games ran on clusters of up to 16 
linked Atari ST computers, and had tournaments, team or singles play, and open 
gaming for $2 an hour. I actually won one round, which is nothing short of a 
miracle, considering that the game was swamped by expert video game players 
who racked up enormous lists of wins, including one guy who won a 15- against- 
1 round singlehandedly! The graphics were simple but effective, and knowing 
that you were playing against other people made the game extremely 
stimulating. But the really spectacular event was the interactive BattleTech 
display at FASA\'s booth. Four players in teams of two were seated in realistic 
BattleMech cockpits, with complex display and hand controls taking the place
of the game\'s "Neurohelmets." They then fought one another on a computer-
generated battlefield, with great graphics, internal status readouts,
surround-sound effects, and total attention to BattleTech rules, including
disabled-unit movement and overheating problems. The game was phenomenally
popular, even at $3 for 5 minutes or until dead, whichever comes first.
Advanced setups allowed torso movement, and perhaps even jumping and kicking,
although I never saw an Advanced game. As usual, FASA demonstrated that the
most cash inflow came to the display with the glitziest setup, and this year
they even beat last year\'s Steiner-Davion wedding. Yeesh. 

On matters Travellerish, I had a short pair of conversations with Loren 
Wiseman and Marc Miller. Loren\'s a very nice guy but has such a full schedule 
that it\'s damned near impossible to get anything out of him, and Marc is just 
too busy to give anyone more than two minutes\' attention. Digest Group was not 
there this year, and their "To Kill An Archduke" MegaTraveller event was 
cancelled, but I THINK I saw Gary Thomas there, looking so frayed that I 
thought better of hassling him. Sorry, gang, but I just wasn\'t in nosy 
reporter mode this weekend. What I did get was as follows.

These are lean times for the Traveller games, my friends. Digest Group is
doing its best to support the rules, but the big emphasis at GDW appears to be
on its other games, the ones with the four-digit numbers in their titles. Let
it also be remembered that Digest Group\'s people, despite their enthusiasm, DO
have day jobs, and that it\'s a miracle we get as much as we do from them. But
don\'t despair; both companies will be putting out their usual two or three
items a year, and let\'s remember that in the early years we were grateful to
get that much new Traveller material! That having been said, let\'s look at
what IS out there: 

Currrently in the works from GDW are "Fighting Ships of the Imperium," a set 
of ship descriptions and MegaTrav stats for various and sundry ships in the 
Rebellion. Cutting through the sales pitch, what it appears to be is a reprint 
and expansion of the old Supplement 9, for people (like me) who haven\'t the 
time and patience to futz around with the new rules for ship generation. 
There\'s also "Knightsfall," an adventure module for political intrigue(?). I 
haven\'t any data on that. GDW was also plugging the two new books from Digest 
Group, "The MegaTraveller Alien" and (I believe it\'s called) "The Black Duke."
No data on either of these, although I believe that the former book will be a 
reprint and expansion of Alien Modules 1,3,4, and perhaps 5. The Aslan, Vargr, 
and Zhodani will be covered; the K\'Kree definitely won\'t, and neither will the 
Solomani or Hivers; the Droyne are iffy, but I\'d guess that they will be, 
having been mentioned in detail in the Referee\'s Companion. For all you far- 
antispinward fans out there, it looks like you\'re all S.O.L. Sorry.

Representation of the Traveller rules systems at GenCon was pitiful at best. 
Besides my games and the ones sponsored by (and cancelled by) DGP, I counted 
three other Traveller events, and they were all your basic kick-ass mercenary 
contract sessions. The RPGA was supposed to run a Traveller tournament this 
year, but I don\'t recall whether or not that went through. I\'m not complaining
at all about the rarity of Traveller stuff though; as usual, "Near Miss VI:
Radio Free Terra" was a smash hit, sold out on all three rounds long before
the Con opened with Generic Ticket holders lined up for overflow seating. The
sessions went well at first and got better as the weekend progressed, with
Saturday Night\'s game a real free-for-all, half the players having been in
previous Near Miss games since 1985 and the other half being experienced and
inventive newcomers. Navy Ensign Horace Plimpton and Daisy Ferne of the
Columbia University Music Dept. are now happily married (imagine Rick Moranis
and Shelley Duvall as Romeo and Juliet) and all\'s well that ends well.

Schedule permitting, "Near Miss VII: Over the Edge" will run at GenCon 1990,
and there will be a Near Miss Book out from either DGP or GDW at some time in
the near future, both Gary Thomas and Marc Miller at least being willing to
entertain the concept if it\'s well-presented. Meantime, if folx are
interested, I may run bits and pieces of "Borrowed Snapshots," the first
full-length Near Miss story, on the List. 

If anyone else has any questions about GenCon, feel free to ask.

later,

The World Builder\'s handbook is out. I have it and I like it, even if it
does put the sun at the center of an elliptical orbit rather than one focus.

The MegaTraveller Alien Book will be out later this year.

In getting ready for running the latest Near Miss event at GenCon, I 
familiarized myself with the new combat system. After about five minutes of 
reading, I came up with the following:

SCENARIO 1:

Hiram Trilby, a con artist, is being pounded into steakumms by Thor Phangle of 
the Imperial Marines. Thor is wearing full Battle Dress, Hi Stellar design, 
with an armor value of 18 over his entire body, and Thor\'s life force is about 
18, giving him 3 damage points to unconsciousness. (For the purposes of this 
explanation, Hiram\'s stats and armor are unimportant.) As he frantically 
attempts to save his own worthless life, Hiram manages to get his gun hand up 
between Thor\'s arms as Thor is attempting to twist his head off, places the 
muzzle of his Gauss Pistol against Thor\'s eyeslit, and fires.

Hiram\'s player, a decent kid who\'s never learned to be crafty and to take 
advantage of gaping holes in rules systems, is doing what appears to be the 
sensible thing: he makes his task to hit one level harder (from simple to 
routine, a safe bet) and allows himself a pinpoint attack, thus halving the 
armor value of Thor\'s Battle Dress and maximizing his chances to escape.

Okay so far?

He rolls an 11 on his attack. The result, according to the rules, is as 
follows. The attack is with a penetration-4 weapon, against an armor class of 
18 halved or 9. Weapon < Armor, so Zero penetration, and since the armor is 
full-body, no damage occurs. But wait! Hiram needed a 7 to hit, and rolled an 
11! That\'s a 4+ exceptional success, so Hiram quadruples his damage (4x0=0) or 
takes a minimum of 2 points. Thor can take 3, so the 2-point hit to his face 
doesn\'t knock him out.

The result: the Gauss needles bounce off the armored eyeslit, except for one 
which manages to penetrate and do damage. Thor is injured, and really mad now. 
Hiram had better hope for an 11 or better on his next roll, assuming he has 
any ammo left in his pistol, or he\'s doomed. (Note that the choice of shot
placement did nothing here: only the high roll did.) 

SCENARIO 2:

As above, except Hiram has only a 5mm body pistol (with a Penetration value of 
0 at any range!), and Hiram\'s being played by a different player, say for 
example, me. (Thor\'s doomed. |-> ) He calmly places the pistol\'s muzzle 
against Thor\'s chest, where the thickest armor plating is located, and pulls
the trigger, once. He rolls an 11.

We now consult the rules again. Hiram didn\'t try anything fancy to maximize 
his chances of getting through the impossibly thick armor Thor was wearing: he 
just fired. At this range, that\'s a Simple task. He hits, and his weapon 
obviously does no damage (it didn\'t last time, and 0 vs. 18 is a lot worse 
than 4 vs. 9). But wait! he needed a 3, and rolled an 11, so that\'s an 8+ 
exceptional success, for octuple damage (8x0=0) or a minimum of 4 points!

The result: Thor\'s knocked unconscious by the tiny bullet expending its energy 
against his chest. Hiram removes Thor\'s limp hands from his thoat, places the 
pistol over Thor\'s heart, and fires until he rolls two 7s or an 11, at which 
point Thor is dead. (Note that he does not declare a coup de grace, as this is 
an automatic zero-penetration hit and hence does no damage. He states he is in 
combat, and thus must roll for his hits, risking a miss but also allowing for 
the exceptional success that knocked Thor out in the first place.)

The latest Challenge has a single article on Traveller, but a voluminous
one.  [As Metlay pointed out, Traveller seems as if it\'s becoming
"Grandfathered"].  Anyhow, the article is a long (about 24 pages)
pullout section describing the Hinterworlds Sector, in fact, you can
remove it from the Challenge issue as a booklet in istelf.  At the front
is about 5-6 pages of discussion, explaining the history, economics,
government, and minor races present in the Hinterworlds.  Following that
is 16 pages devoted to subsector and UWP information in the standard
tabular form, and a two-page map of the entire sector.  I really enjoyed
the article, and it would provide me with an entirely different corner
of the Imperium to go out and explore and flesh out myself, a fresh
change from the ubiquitous Spinward Marches campaigns.

I\'m doing a review of World Builder\'s Handbook for you guys and gals,
and I will try to get it done this week.

Well, I got my copy of the _World Builder\'s Guide_ the other day...  I like it.

I have never seen the original Grand Census/Grand Survey set, so I really only
have Digest Group\'s word that it is improved and expanded.

The book is full-sized (8-1/2 x 11?) and center stapled.  96 pages.  Nice art.

The first half of the book, "Survey and Exploration", details the actual
process the IISS uses to explore new worlds.  This is a detailed treatment of
the subject, including types of surveys and IISS guidelines.  If you are
running a Scout-oriented campaign, you need this book.  A pretty complete
picture of what the Scouts do.  ("Three stars"- and if anyone can tell me why
the IISS doesn\'t use rank for Field operatives, they get the fourth star...)

Included are several equipment data sheets, in the new format used in the
Referee\'s Gaming Kit.  (You know- the screen...)  Detailed equipment: (with
pictures)

Handheld Densitometer   Neural Activity Sensor  Image Converter Binoculars
"PRIS" Field Glasses    Med Scanner     Bio-Scanner     Floater  Gyrocompass
Multichronometer        Language Translator     Handheld Communicator
Comdots         Remote Earpiece         Lasercom Relay  Data/Display Headset
General Purpose Vacc Suit       (three kinds of) Portable Life Support Systems
Tailored Vacc Suit      Lt. Duty Vacc Suit      Hostile Enviroment Vacc Suit
Utility Vest    Grav Belt  (*Whew*)

Also: Detailed treatments, with task libraries, for the G-tube, Grav Bike,
Hurricane-class Air/raft, and the Survey G-Carrier.  (Also seen in 101
Vehicles)  One page for each craft.

Then...  Ship plans for the Donosev Survey vessel.  Not as detailed as the
SOG\'s Trader diagrams, but ok.

The remaining 42 pages deal with "Building a World".  Without going too deeply
into it, it seems pretty complete: Atmosphere, Law levels, Religious issues...

If you\'re doing these things in your campaign, this book seems like a good buy,
folks.

First, let me say I\'ve never fueled a jet.  I have fuel a race car (So I
don\'t know how close these two are.)  But this has never stopped anyone on
the net.   :-)

So I\'d say you don\'t need to make a roll except under combat conditions (or
something real close, like jabba is coming into your landing bay and you
need to get out before he kicks your ass.)  So you can take all the time you
need.  So unless the player was clutzing out.  He could do it.

Now then how much fuel does a plane take?  As for cars you can fuel them
(15-20 gals) in 15-20 sec.  Now then they have special tanks so you can fuel
them fast.  (extra outlets for air and stuff)  So anyway in 2 mins you could
get 120gals in (and change the tires  :-)

Another question on TV they always talk about how many pounds of fuel they
have left.  Is this a more proper unit to use in a/c?

As for setting fuel off.  On a nova from 1 or 2 seasons ago ("How safe is
safe."  I think)  They said that it was the misting of fuel that causes the
problems.  So if you fumble and mist it I guess you could be in for a bad time.

Now remember, the times included with the task description is typically
10% of the time to perform the task.  You have to role 3d6 to determine
the real amount of time the task really takes.  For the above case, that works
out to 6-36 minutes with an average of 20-26 min..  It is not a flat 2 minutes
unless that task says "2 min. absolute."

Does that make the time needed more reasonable?  Although I must admit,
36 min. to fuel an aircraft, unless it\'s an Eastern jetliner :-), seems a
bit on the long side; especially when the Imperial storm troopers want to
frag you for stealing the emperor\'s scepter :-)

I saw a friend\'s copy  a few days ago.  It looked _real_ nice.

I don\'t know how you folks keep published \'spoilers\' from your groups,
but for those who can, I thought I\'d try to help keep the secrets...

In the Imperial Encylopedia, in the Referee\'s section, there is a notation
under Imperial Stationary that describes how Norris essentially forged his
appointment as Archduke...  Why is this included, and why here?  Is this some
essential seed for future "official" development, or just a strange idea
someone had?  It is fairly odd, in that all the published material I have
seen would give the impression that Strephon *would* have made the appointment.

Anyone care to speculate on this?  Also, has anyone joined the "History of the
Imperium Working Group" (HIWG)?  To what extent is this group\'s work going to
be incorporated into the "official" universe?

My campaigns (fantasy and now SF) have always been very history oriented, so
these issues are bound to come up in my group...

Makes perfect sense to me, actually. He was nearly assassinated by one of
his own admirals (Santanocheev, I believe) and had to take control of the
Navy to save his own hide, to say nothing of the Marches. Also, keep in
mind that the ImpEncyc was written by Norris\'s own people, and they tend
to paint him in a favorable light. Whether or not his appointment to Archduke
was honest was open to question, but its usefulness is moot (if you\'ll pardon
the expression |-> ): it\'s saved the Marches from fragmentation. If ole
Norrie-baby\'s a crook, at least he\'s a competent, smart crook.

Hmmm...  I obviously missed a turn here.  I am a new ref, to all new
Travellers- is the above background regarding Santanocheev & Bolden-Tukera
pre-MegaTraveller?  If so, are the publications concerned still available?

Tukera?  Of Tukera lines perhaps?

>From what I can gather from "The Spinward Marches Campaign" and the board game
"Fifth Frontier War", at the time of that war Santanocheev was Sector Admiral,
in charge of defending the Spinward Marches. He was a complete incompetent, and
had obtained the position more on the basis of social standing and court
connections than any real ability. (In the board game, he\'s actually a
liability to any fleet that gets him - they\'re better off with no admiral at
all!)

Before the war, Naval Intelligence (in which Norris was then a minor officer)
had produced a report which was very critical of Santanocheev. Unfortunately,
it criticised him wrongly. As a result, Santanocheev set up a new organisation
to take its place, comprised mainly of yes-men and bootlickers. Being the more
competent organisation, and not being actually disbanded, Naval Intelligence
was the one that got wind of what the Zhodani were planning, and because of his
former connection, Norris received that information. He knew what an idiot
Santanocheev was, and asked the Emperor to do something about the situation,
e.g. sack Santanocheev and put Norris in charge. What Strephon did was to send
Norris an Imperial Warrant, which basically says "This person can do what he
wants because he\'s doing it in the Emperor\'s name". Unfortunately, the warrant
didn\'t reach Norris. He eventually learnt that the ship carrying it had crash-
landed on Algine, which was interdicted, therefore he was forbidden to go
there. He went anyway, his reasoning being that if he found the warrant, it
would allow him to override the interdiction. If he didn\'t, he was in deep
trouble, but that was a risk he chose to take. Meanwhile, he put about rumours
that he was ill, he was dead, he\'d been assassinated or deposed, etc., to
cover his disappearance. Eventually he found the warrant, came back, kicked
out Santanocheev and saved the Marches.

That\'s the sort of man Norris is. Another of his schemes was the funding of an
"Azhanti High Lightning" class cruiser by getting all the school children of
the Spinward Marches to make donations out of their lunch money. The ship was
named "Children of the Marches" in their honour.

Now, what I want to know is, has anyone written an adventure based on Norris\'
expedition to Algine? It looks like a hook just waiting for someone to hang a
plot on it!

Listen up, folx.

The following is my admittedly hazy remembrance of what was, for a while,
the most interesting bit of political intrigue in Traveller, from a time
when the Spinward Marches were the only part of the Imperium about which
anyone outside GDW knew anything (the Solomani Rim still being under prep):

When the Fifth Frontier War began in 1107 (That\'s about 1981 or so), the 
Imperial Navy was under the command of a sleaze bucket known through the
Traveller News Service as Grand Admiral hault-Santanocheev. He proceeded 
to lose the Jewell Cluster, the Lanth Subsector, and most of the rest of
the frontier regions of the Marches, in a stunning series of Zhodani wins
that ended up threatening Rhylanor itself! 

Norris was not amused, and he told Santanocheev as much.

Santanocheev did the only sensible thing: he had the Duke assassinated.

Or tried to, anyway.

(Insert sound of flung wad of excrement striking rotary air blower here)

It took until after the War was over for us poor readers of the JTAS to
piece everything together, but as nearly as I can work out, what happened
was that Norris\'s death was reported to the News Service, only to be
followed by a statement that the Duke wasn\'t dead, just resting |-> .
The rumors of a coverup persisted until Norris himself came on the scene and
forcibly removed Santanocheev from power. He couldn\'t trust any of the
chiefs of staff, and he needed to be in firm command of the situation
when the Corridor Fleet arrived on the scene looking for someone to kill,
so he took command of the Navy himself. Under his command, the Zhodani were
driven back, Lanth was recaptured, Jewell was freed (it never fell), and
the Zhodani negotiated a ceasefire, followed by an armistice on 001-1111.
No territories changed sides, and that was that. (Oh, by the way, the 
other members of the OUtworld Coalition, the Sword Worlds and the Vargr,
got chewed up and spat out nearly a year before the ceasefire. They didn\'t
negotiate a ceasefire-- they SURRENDERED! Can you say, "Please don\'t hurt
me?" You can? Well, SAY IT LOUDER! AND GROVEL!) The upshot of the whole 
business was that Norris, as the real architect of the victory, came out
smelling better than any Admiral since Arbellatra Alkhalkoi stomped the
Zhodani in the Second Frontier War, then took her fleet to the Core and
established the dynasty whose latest child is lying on the floor of the
Iridium Throne Room with Dulinor\'s slug in his forehead....

But I digress. |->

The point is, Santanocheev was stripped of command, tried, courtmartialed,
cashiered, and exiled. He wasn\'t killed, nor was a public reading of the
charges made, to hide the depth of the corruption in the Imperial Navy,
which resembles the bad guys in the Star Wars movies more and more as you 
learn how they REALLY operate.... (HISS! BOO!) 

Norris has been an immensely popular and charismatic leader ever since.
He knew that with the proper stamp of authority, he could avoid a lot of
hassles when the assassination became public knowledge. so he made himself
Archduke of Deneb. Simple, wasn\'t it? It\'d be a lot easier to prove if he
could explain why, by the time his appointment was announced, the whole
Corridor Fleet (which was ostensibly his to command) was on its way to the 
Imperial Core, leaving the sector defenseless.... Oh, well, nobody\'s perfect.

Oh, and Leonard Bolden-Tukera, the Marquis of Aramis, is married to a woman
who\'s a full-blooded Tukera family member. He has a lot of vested interests
in Tukera, and in Akerut, its local feeder line serving the Aramis subsector.
His chief rival is Marc hault-Oberlindes, Baron of Feri, whose Oberlindes
Lines are making life difficult for Akerut these days. Oberlindes is a sharp,
hardworking businessman whose reputation for taking care of his employees 
is nothing short of legendary. Bolden-Tukera is a fat, stupid slob who
couldn\'t inspire loyalty in a tribe of Orcs. ("Orcs? What\'re they?" "Oh, some
minor race from the Hinterworlds. Currently fighting with something called
the Bobbits, or Boggits, or something like that....") The tradewar between
Akerut and Oberlindes of 1105 and 1106 came to an abrupt end when Oberlindes
was able to prove that Akerut\'s security chief was selling meson guns to a
Vargr corsair band for use against his own country\'s shipping, and lining
his own pockets with the commission. (See THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE.) The Duke
wasn\'t too pleased about that, either.....

Any other questions?

This message is forwarded by my friend Maurice. Actually *he*
never refereed a Traveller game and I\'ve been his GM, but never
mind...

I have a question about Judges Guild\'s playing aid "Fifty
Starbases". Does anybody know what the maps are for? I never
managed to see any use in them. There is a map key with lots
of interesting symbols, but they never appear on the maps.

Am I supposed to create the maps myself? If this is true,
I paid an awfull lot of money for something I still have
to do myself anyway.

I would appreciate if somebody could help me with this.

Well!  Thanks to Adrian & metlay for filling in the gaps.  This sort of
backgroud is just what I wanted!

By the way, a while back I was asking if anyone had worked up plans for the
Imperialines TJ Freighter/Courier that appears in the Rebellion Sourcebook.
It seemed that no one had, so...

A friend and I have been diligently working on laying out the ship plans.  This
thing is Big.  (Or maybe I\'ve screwed up the procedure...)  At any rate, once
it\'s done, I\'d be happy to share it with folks for postage & copying cost.  I\'d
be interested to see if we\'ve done it "correctly".  Drop me a message if you\'re
interested- we should have it done in the next week or so.

(Of course, by then there will probably be an official deck plan that makes
ours look ratty, but that\'s the risk you run.)

wrong, then please accept my version of the story as the one that is
considered common ex post facto public knowledge in the postwar years.
(The trip to Algine was of course never mentioned to the media, so the
assassination attempt was the most palatable alternative story, and the
one that the news services ran as details of the case were allowed to 
come to light.) At any rate, Adrian\'s story agrees with mine in one
fundamental area: Norris is used to getting things done, regardless of
whether he has to step beyond the bounds of propriety. We should be glad
that he\'s a more moral, decent guy than Lucan....

What they are is fifty funky drawings of roads and buildings, most shaded
in haltones so you can\'t label them. You\'re supposed to pick one that looks
pretty, fill in the suggested code marks where appropriate ("Hmm, I\'ll make
this circle here the landing pad, and this series of ovals the fuel tanks"),
and let your player characters look at them and go "Ooooh. Ahhhhh."

I\'ve found use for perhaps six of the fifty drawings. The rest are good for
a laugh.

PS. Anyone remember the mess Judges\' Guild made of the four whole sectors they
    mapped for GDW before their license got pulled? There are two versions of
    Ley Sector, the Glimmerdrift Reaches, and two other sectors, called the
    Crucis Margin and the Maranantha-Alkahest Sectors by Judges\' Guild and 
    something different by GDW, I can\'t recall what at the moment. Confusion
    and fun for Imperium mappers everywhere, YIPPEE!

The story is in "The Spinward Marches Campaign". I don\'t have it right here, so
I can\'t check which part; I think it\'s in the part describing Santanocheev,
Norris and the Zhodani commander (who was also in his position more due to
social status than skill). "Fifth Frontier War" has admiral counters for all
three; Santanocheev and the Zhodani chief are worse than useless, while Norris
seems to be great at planning and initiative, but not so good at tactics (not
as bad as the other two, though).

similiar in flavor to Traveller.  FASA has *loads* of very professional and
well written rules, text, history, fiction and graphics for BATTLETECH, which
is pretty amazing to me since BATTLETECH has only been out a couple of years.
(I believe).  That\'s quite a contrast to Traveller & GDW.  In this respect, I
consider BATTLETECH to be the way Traveller \'should have been\'.

Other comments:

BATTLETECH\'s rules seem to be complete enough, yet very simple.  It leaves me
with a feeling that I\'m missing something, or the rules are missing something.
Yet the only thing that I can think of is that  BATTLETECH has very little to
account for  differing Tech Levels.

BATTLETECH is even more militaristic then Traveller was...  Necessarily so? I
don\'t think so.  I think that it is still quite possible to play a non military
campaign with BATTLETECH.

Date: Mon, 31 Jul 89 08:48:09 +0200
From: Maurice Schekkerman <schekker@cst.prl.philips.nl>
Subject: [Tech Level Ruminations -- JamesP]

I have followed the discussions on several aspects of the tech-level a while
ago with interest (yes, I\'m new to the list). Still the whole handling of it
just doesn\'t sound right to me. I will try to explain my view by looking at
the situation as it now exists on Earth.

On Earth we\'ve countries with different technology level. The USA, Japan and
Western Europe have technology level 8. The other countries have a less level.
Especially in Africa the tech level is quite low. Some of these countries have
the tech level of around 1900 (or even less). Still this doesn\'t imply that
they build steam engines, very primitive cars and so on. They\'re better of 
importing them. The higher developed countries can produce better machines
and cars at lower costs.

So, why aren\'t they full of all this imported stuff. Because they can\'t afford
them. In general the higher the technology level of a country, the richer they
are. Low tech countries are poor countries which just can\'t pay for all the 
stuff they want.

This doesn\'t imply however that all technology is built in the countries with
the highest tech level. Most products can be produced at lower tech levels 
(think of the countries in South-East Asia). The production there is not as
advanced as in the high tech countries, but the people are a lot cheaper.
This also solves the problem of computers and jump drives becoming smaller
at higher tech levels. Of course the USA can now built a computer which can do
the same thing twenty years ago, but is x times smaller. But the countries
which lay twenty years behind don\'t build the computers which were build then,
they just build very cheap computers which aren\'t very advanced. So they have
the technology of twenty years back but build computers which weren\'t even
available then!

This is the key-point in my view on technology level. Less developed countries
don\'t build the same devices advanced countries did when they were on that
level. They build the simpler devices which they can produce cheaper than the 
advanced ones.

Now replace countries with planets and you have my basic view on interstellar
trading. The planets with the highest TL are the richest planets. The planets
with a lower TL can produce cheaper. And the difference between spaceships of
TL 12 and TL 15 is that spaceships of TL 12 are simpler to construct and 
maintain, so they are cheaper. However, they aren\'t only used on TL 12 worlds.
Worlds of higher TL may also have use for them.

[This would account for the plethora of Tech 12 startships in the Imperium.
A question, are we being fair to our players. I know I tend to side with 
my players and see if I can get them the Newest equipment available. I know
this is digressing a bit, but is it right to give player characters the 
advantage. The game already does that does it not? Just a thought - Greg]

I don\'t know the Traveller rules very well, so perhaps this view is 
contradicting with them. Still I think this approach is a neat way to cover 
[Bsome of the problems which were discussed in the list.
So again, why doesn\'t a TL 15 world built TL 12 ships (with much smaller 
drives, etc.)? They perhaps do, but the TL 12 world can also build the smaller 
drives (after all they only have to buy the technology, it is already 
invented). Perhaps the TL 12 drives aren\'t as small as the drives produced on 
the TL 15 world, but they are sure a hell of a lot cheaper.

One last remark. Of course it\'s still possible that a world of low tech
level build obsolete machinery. Perhaps they can\'t buy new technology, perhaps
they lay in a remote part of the galaxy, perhaps they don\'t allow free trade
to protect the government (think of dictators and communist countries on 
Earth), perhaps ...(fill in yourself). Furthermore communication is slow in
the Empire and the trade between planets probably isn\'t as large as between
countries on Earth. So planets with lower tech level may produce machinery
for the local market which is obsolete on the higher TL worlds. But I don\'t
believe that on one world they are still building Spitfires while on e planet
five jumps further away you can by F16 in a discount shop.

Allright, what do you think of it?

Hello Greg,

If everything went right James should have send you my article. (I sent it to
him yesterday). I\'m sorry, but I thought I had lost your mailing address. 
Apparantly I found it somewhere. As you should already have received the 
article, I\'m not including it here (don\'t know how to do it without 
destroying what I have typed already anyway). However, I do have a copy of 
the article, so if anything went wrong, mail me and I\'ll send it to you.

Furthermore I only want to say I like what you\'re doing. I haven\'t seen a
Trade and Commerce Digest in the last few weeks however. I hope it\'s because
yoBu were on holidays, but I\'m afraid it\'s because of lack of articles.
Don\'t give up! 

Then some advice (their just my opinions, so throw away if you want:-)
What I miss in your Digest are personal comments. In order for people to send
the articles to you instead of the mailing list, you have to add something to
the articles (without changing their meaning). Personal comments or suggestions
for discussions might be a good way of doing that.
Furthermore you once or twice took articles from the mailing list itself
because they hadn\'t send the articles to you, although the articles were 
about trade and commerce. I don\'t think that\'s a good idea. Afterall, every-
body already knows the article (it would be something different if you
commented the article and gave suggestions). Why not just mail the \'offenders\'
and ask them if they would send such articles to you in the future.
Another problem is that sometimes you just receive no articles (the
average message traffic isn\'t that high), so there is no digest to send.
And people forget fast (look at me), so if they don\'t receive your digest
they don\'t send articles to you (e.g. they forget or are to lazy to look up
your mailing address). There are two solutions:
1. include your mailing address in the standard crap james always include in
   the Traveller mailing-list (I suggested this to james also).
2. make sure your digest appears weekly. If nobody else write an article, you
   do. It doesn\'t have to be long. Especially discussion topics might be a 
   good idea (they result in articles for your mailing list). As you must be
   interested in trade and commerce, it can\'t be hard to think of some good
   topics.

That\'s all. I repeat that I do like what your doing and hope that some of 
my suggestions might be usefull to you.

P.S. As you can see my English isn\'t that good, so you have my permission to
correct any error you find in my article (stronger, I would appreciate it!)

[I want to thank Maurice for his comments and his suggestions. I will be
trying to get an Article out weekly, and I will add my comments, stupid 
though they may be. - Greg]

Greetings, fellow travellers :-)

I am currently working on writing a program to save me the trouble of
rolling dice.  I am making the program based directly on the World
Builder\'s Handbook, put out by Digest Group.  My questions are this:

1.	Is there, and if so, what kind of copyright problems would I
	have if I wanted to distribute the program via this mailing
	list?

2.	Is there interest?

3.	Assuming that there is a copyright problem, would there be
	interest in my sending the program to people who have proved
	(via a receipt or other hard copy) that they own the book.



I await your replies (hopefully I do not need an asbestos suit)

Ask DGP if they don\'t mind. They may wish to license you. I\'d like to see it.

Tecnically, you can\'t distribute it at all, even to owners of the book, without
permission from the copyright owners.

There are others on this list, who probably wish to remain anonymous,
who would be able to answer your question regarding copyrights.  If they
have a reply and wish to retain their anonymity, I\'d be happy to
manually edit and forward a reply.

Jonathan, take a look at Page 96 of the WBH.  It should answer your
question very nicely.  To paraphrase, the WBH will be made available by
Digest Group on computers (IBM PC, Macintosh, Apple II, Commodore
64/128), available Jan 1990.  The WB program will be $24.95 for IBM and
Mac, and $29.95 Apple II and Commodore.  They are also sending the UWP
data for "37 sectors in and near the Imperium", called "Second Survey
Data", which will also cost 24.95/29.95.  They aren\'t taking any pre-orders,
though.

Maybe somone on this list could convince DGP to let them do a UNIX port
of the software and data files?

For those of you who are using the World Builders Handbook, there
are a couple of minor typos on page 63.

The typos are on page 63, step 12, the Seismic Stress Factor
calculations.  The given equation is:

	F = X + P + M + S

where

	F = Seismic Stress Factor
	X = 1d6 - 3
	P = random # based on the planetary core type
	M = Satellite diameter in km + (orbit number * 64).  Compute for
	    each satellite and add all together
	S = Mass of central star + worlds orbital distance in AUs

The problem is the calculation for M and S.  They should read:

	M = Satellite diameter in km / (orbit number * 64).  Compute for
	    each satellite and add all together
	S = Mass of central star / worlds orbital distance in AUs

Somehow the slash "/" got replaced with a plus "+".  Either that, or
they are trying to use the divide sign and the printing was not good
for those characters.

I came across this while programming the step on my system.  I was
getting outrageous numbers until I looked at the examples given, (the
results are ok, the description is also wrong) and realized that
somebody made a small mistake.

Metlay is totally wrong from a legal point of view.  Books are copyrighted,
which means no one else can publish the book (or parts of the book) without
permission of the copyright holder.  Since jbayer is writing a program, it is
very unlikely that he will be coping large sections of the book.  There are,
however, two dangers:

    1. That jbayer\'s documentation might violate the copyright in some way.
       He should be very careful to avoid using paragraphs similar to 
       paragraphs in the world building book.

    2. Jbayer could violate copywrites by distributing tables from the book.
       Remember that copyright covers the form of a book, NOT THE INFORMATION
       IN THE BOOK!  As long as jbayer does not display tables that look like
       the tables in the book he is OK.  Also, using tables from the book is
       fine, it is displaying tables so that they look like tables in the book
       that is a problem.

Consider an example:  There is something called the Yourdon design method,
which was described by Mr. Yourdon in a book he wrote.  There are many software
companies which sell software which implements this methodology.  Yourdon is
one of these companies, but there are several others.  Jbayer is doing the
exact same thing, so he will not have any legal problems.  Accounting
software is very similar.  The ideas have all been published in books, but
that does not keep people from appling those same ideas to computer programs.

It is also important to note that a computer program is not a dirivitive
work.  Examples of dirivitive works are translations to foreign languages
or editing a book down into a short story or magazine article.  Obviously,
a computer program is a different form of expression from a book.  It can
not be a dirivitive work unless it contains text from the book.

Remember that some phases are not mearly copyrighted, but also trademarked.
Trademark is a much stronger pertection than copyright, so be careful how
you use words like TRAVELLER which are trademarked.  You can still use
them, of course, but you must say that they are trademarked.

I\'m not a lawyer.

Does this mean that I can distribute a compiled version of the program,
but not a source code version?  The source code version would obviously
contain tables from the book, in almost the same format as the book.  

Regarding documentation, all I would supply would be instructions for
running the program.  All interpretation would be referred to the book. 
This would solve # 1 above, I think.

Is there anybody from Digest Group or GDW on this mailing list who could
respond with some more concrete information?

This is part of the legal discussion of writing a program based on a book.

I do not think so.  The tables in your program would look like this:

int extra_special_table[3][10] = {
    { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 },
    { 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,100},
    { 111,222,333,444,555,666,777,888,999,1000}
} ;

But in the book, it would look like this:

                    Extra Special Table

       +----
       |   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9    0

These would not be the folks I would ask, unless you trust them completely.
They have a large vested interest in the outcome.  I\'d ask a friend who was
a lawyer, if you have one.  I wrote this responce (and my last one) off the
top of my head.  Next weekend, I\'ll get a chance to put this question to a
friend of mine who is a business lawyer.  I\'ll pass on what he says.

I\'m not a lawyer.

Well, it\'s probably more complicated than posters so far would have
you believe.

As joshua@atherton.com pointed out, you normally have full legal ownership
of any software you wrote "from scratch" on your own time.  His arguments
about inclusion of tables may be incorrect -- one is allowed to "quote"
copyrighted works in an original work to some extent, and at any rate, if
you embed the tables in C code, just the reformatting could make them your
own work.

However, there exists a special kind of copyright status specifically for
*games*.  This is why no one can produce a computer game just like Monopoly
except with slightly rewritten text and graphics.  It is possible that DG
would argue that their "World Builder\'s Handbook" is in fact a new "game",
and that the "concept" contained therein is thus protected.

This and other factors make it appear that you probably have three safe
choices.  First, you can just release the stuff.  If you do this, I would
strongly suggest that you consult with a lawyer with copyright expertise
first, as you could conceivably get sued.  Remember that in America, one can
sue over practically anything with no penalty :-).  Second, you can get
written permission from DG to distribute your code.  This may or may not be
possible.  Third, you can design your own world-building system from
scratch...

In answer to your question, no, an object-only distribution wouldn\'t help
anything, according to several court decisions on the subject...

GDW superceeded the JG versions of the sectors when Atlas of the
Imperium came out. Apparently, Marc was not terribly impressed
with their efforts. It was frusterating for us at High Passage
as well. JG placed a world in Glimmerdrift Reaches with a jump
route extending into the Old Expanses, into an area where no
world was placed. As a result, we had to modify the Rusco
subsector, adding a world and several jump routes to make the
whole thing fit. The added world is named Siaj, which stands for
Searing is a jerk (Dave Searing designed the JG sectors).

A useless but interesting bit of trivia, no?

Hey folks, I encourage you to ask the list for advice, but when it comes
to real-life legal matters you better call your lawyer.  Please don\'t
accept as truth anything about law or contracts except what a lawyer
discusses with you as his client.

Moving back to science fiction, anyone want to come up with a Law Level
chart for software copyrighting? We can discuss copyright law in a
fictional universe as much as we want! :-)

Some time ago I tried my hand at the Megatraveller ship design
system and attempted to create the smallest ship with a spinal
gun possible  -  sort of a space-age floating gun platform  -
and I came up with two insights: One (a minor one) was that it
was ridiculous that you only have a choice of 3 or 4 different
sizes in spinal mounts for each tech level. Instead, I suggest
a table where you can cross-reference tech level  with desired
UCP factor and come up with the size and price of a spinal gun
to meet your precise needs. Ah well.. some day I may even make
such a table (Sure! Just after I\'ve finished a couple of dozen
other projects... :-/)

   The other insight, however, is a major one, and destined to
make my name shine  amongst spaceship designers throughout the
Imperium! (Ta-dah!):
   I tried first with a 8000 T design and then with a 10000 T.
To no avail  -  it couldn\'t be done.  It was the fuel consump-
tion that defeated me.  Those spinal mounts uses up tremendous
amounts of power. I could accomodate the power plant needed to
feed that  ravenous beast,  but the fuel  -  no way.  You just
can\'t imagine  the amount of fuel needed  to keep  that spinal
gun blazing away for a full 30 days!

   !?!?!?!?! Say! Run that last sentence by me again!

That\'s right, starship fuel requirements are calculated on the
assumption, that all guns are fired **constantly** for the en-
tire 30 days that the fuel are supposed to last!

Now, that\'s not really a reasonable assumption, is it? Come to
think about it, fuel consumption calculations also assume that
the maneuver drive is going full blast for the entire 30 days.
But traders  usually  spends 1 week of every 2  in jump space,
where you can\'t use the maneuver drive,  and several days more
on the ground or in orbit loading and unloading passengers and
goods.  On an ordinary  landing and takeoff  a ship  with a 1G
drive would use the drive for less than 20 hours (this assumes
a word size of 10). A refueling run would take longer, but the
ship would be getting more fuel at the same time! So actually,
many traders freighters could make do with 1 day\'s maneuvering
fuel.

Well, this is perhaps a bit TOO restrictive, but I really feel
that a starship constructor would be justified in cutting fuel
space quite a bit.  The figures  I\'m using myself,  is 15 days
worth of maneuvering fuel and 33 1/3 hours (100 combat rounds)
worth of weapon fuel.

Now, the last figure is just "grabbed out of the air" (to use a
danish expression),  and if anyone  with experience  in playing
\'Trillion Credit Squadron"  and knowlegde about how long an en-
gagement usually lasts,  could comment on this,  I would really
appreciate it.

One of my players thinks that the Rancke Ship Design Philosophy
are faulty because a fusion drive is either "on" or "off" - you
can\'t  turn the output  up or down.  I maintain that controlled
fusion is just that - controlled. Oh, perhaps not at tech level
 9, but surely by tech level 11 or 12?  What do you think?  (In
any case,  even if fusion drive ARE only either on or off,  you
could easily have 3 different fusion drives. If you connect the
three chambers,  you could cold-start the other two in a matter
of seconds as long as one of them were on).

There really is a precedent in this question, In the GDW boxed module
"Beltstrike" there is a table on fuelconsumption when going less than
maximum acceleration, (On the other hand, the same module also stated
that the manueverdrive made a forcefield (:^)) that protected the crew from
the hazardous cosmic radiation. In MegaT this is accompliced with lots
of shielding (This is the reason why all exo-atmospherical craft must
have a Armor of 40 or more)).

A resonable way of handling this is to compute the Kilolitres of H/hour/MW
and then use the maximum energyconsumption during an hour as the 
consumption for that hour. The systems that can be assumed to be operating
at all times are the environment, the computer, the controls & the sensors.
During jump only the environment and the computer needs power, When at normal
flight the drives (at normal Gee or less), the comp, the controls, the environ
and the sensors, And in combat: Everything (including agility).

This assumption also raises interesting questions regarding vehicle design.
One trick i\'ve thought of (and used in a number of designs) is to power
weapons with a high energy demand from energy stored in zuruchai crystals
(jump-energy-sinks, see "Starship Operators Manual by DGP"), 

Take for example that you want to power an 100MW weapon with a ROF of 10, 
but the only Powerplant
that fits the hull only have 50MW to spare to such entertainment.
To solve the problem you install Z-crystals capable of storing 50MJ
(Mega Joule, measure of energy, if you have 1 joule you can power something
that demands 1 watt for one second) The storagecapacity of 13.5 kl of
z-crys os about 600MJ (deduced from MegaT & old HighGuard) so you
should install around 1-2 kl of crystals, The contraption will function
like this: Half the time the PP will load the z-crys with energy (50MJ) and
the other half of the time this energy and the 50MW that the PP outputs
this period combines to make 100MW for the weapon!
(The ROF will be halved to 5 because the weapon can\'t fire 50% of the time)

The biggest disadvantage is that z-crys can\'t store energy more than a couple
of minutes, Then they\'ll start to decompose and the energy will be released in
an uncontrolled form (heat mostly). 50MJ in close proximity is certainly
an health hazard :-) (A quick calculation gives that the energy released
is roughly compareble to 11kg (22lb) of TNT)

But, all in all, the old system of computing energy consumption *is* somewhat
oversimplifyed, and a more complex system could ease the burden on the
ship and vehicle designers.

Can a non-Hiver join a Hiver Club?

Opinions welcome.

metlay

PS. There\'s a fellow in my newest campaign who rolled up a movie producer 
under the MegaTrav rules (yes, it can be done!) and who\'d dealt with the Hivers
in his youth and had learned about the Manipulators\' Club. So he sent a sealed 
Proposal to Glea and then made a documentary on an unstable political system
in the Solomani Rim on a relatively little-visited world, ostensibly to make
the Imperial public aware of the problem but actually to pique the interest 
of a rival megacorporation, who upon seeing his film decided to turn a profit
on the current situation and who sent a good-sized army there. Years later, 
the political mess reached the Imperium\'s ears and the film was used as 
evidence in the trial of the megacorp VP who\'d ordered the action, who just
happened to be the fellow who\'d gotten the character fired twenty years ago
and embittered him against life in general! So to embarrass this ex-boss, my
player had started a small war, toppled a government or two, and gotten a lot
of people killed. And now he\'s waiting to hear from Glea as to whether or not
he\'s been accepted into the Manipulators\' Club.

I\'m tempted to give it to him; he really did have it all worked out.

If this upload goes properly, here is as supplement to COACC (actually, it\'s a
COACC outtake) on special weapons-- that\'s chemical and nuclear, folks. This
has been submitted for publication in Challenge and may show up there.  Here
goes... Special Weapons for COACC COACC includes a wide variety of
conventional air to ground  weapons for use by tactical aircraft.  However,
tactical and strategic  aircraft also have a wide variety of special weapons--
chemical and  nuclear-- available to them for a number of purposes ranging
from  tactical air support to city and planet-busting. These expanded COACC
rules add special weapons to  MegaTraveller campaigns for situations where
characters are involved in wide-open  warfare and need these weapons to arm
both tactical and strategic  aircraft. Special Weapons Special Weapons include
chemical weapons and nuclear weapons.   They are special because of their mass
destructiveness and because  their possession and use were illegal under the
Imperial Rules of  War.  Now, however, the power of the Imperium has declined
and as  the Rebellion spreads, these deadliest of weapons are coming into
increasing use.

  Chemical Bombs Chemical bombs are filled with either persistent or non-
persistent  chemical agents and a small bursting charge.  Each exploding  bomb
 forms a gas cloud covering approximately 30 meters in diameter.  Chemical
bombs are aimed and dropped with the same DMs to hit a  designated area as low-
drag HE bombs.   Non-persistent agents are released in the form of a gas or
light vapor.   They only affect the designated target area in which the gas
cloud is  physically present, and the  gas cloud drifts with the wind.  Non-
persistent agents dissipate after 3D minutes.  The exact direction and  rate
of draft should be determined randomly by the referee.  Non- persistent agents
cause damage through inhalation. Persistent agents are released in the form of
a heavier vapor, and  contaminate everything they touch.  The initial gas
cloud forms during  the first combat round and a cloud of the same size forms
immediately  down wind on the second combat round.  The area covered by the
clouds remains contaminated until decontamination teams are able to
counteract and clean up the chemical agent.  Persistent agents cause  damage
through inhalation and skin absorption. Chemical Weapons Effects Chemical
weapons are non-lethal or lethal.  Individuals affected by  non-lethal weapons
suffer one wound point per round until they are  unconscious.  Individuals
affected by lethal weapons suffer six wound  points per round until they are
dead. Individuals wearing combat environment suits, vacc suits, combat  armor,
or battle dress or aboard vehicles that are sealed or equipped  with
overpressure systems are not affected by gas weapons.   Individuals with
protective masks who are able to don them before  losing consciousness become
immune to non-persistent chemical  agents.  They require a sealed protective
body suit and mask for  immunity to persistent agents which are absorbed by
the skin. Nuclear Weapons Nuclear weapons are special in more than one sense,
in addition to  being destructive, they are very expensive.  On the average,
they cost  one Megacredit per kiloton of yield.   Crude fission bombs yielding
approximately 20 kilotons become  available at TL6.  However, their bulk and
weight prohibit their  delivery by all but the largest strategic bombers.
They are almost  custom-built weapons and need to be manually armed in flight,
with  the nuclear explosive inserted into the chemical explosive implosion
lenses just before the weapon is dropped. Fission bomb weights drop
dramatically at TL 7 as more powerful  chemical explosives and miniaturized
chain-reaction initiators result  in lighter, more compact, and manageable
bombs.  Nuclear bombs  become light enough to be carried by many fighter and
attack aircraft.   By late TL7, variable yield bombs are designed that accept
several  different nuclear cores with different yields.  Also by late TL7,
"sealed  pit" weapons are developed, bombs with stable nuclear cores  imbedded
in their chemical explosive lenses.  These are treated like  rounds of
ammunition with no special handling other than high  security storage. Fusion
bombs appear in early TL7 with yields eventually reaching  more than 50
megatons.  Early fusion bombs are massive devices  with thick casings needed
to contain the reaction of the fission trigger  long enough to ignite the
fusion fuel.  Techniques such as boosting  the primary fission trigger with
tritium (H3) and the use of solid lithium  rather than liquid hydrogen
isotopes as a fusion fuel result in smaller,  more efficient bombs and missile
warheads as technology advances. At TL8, "dial-a-yield" tactical nuclear
weapons become available.   These light-weight bombs have their yields set by
the aircraft pilot just  before drop.  A cockpit control meters the amount of
tritium injected  into the nuclear core of this boosted fission weapon.  As
the fission  explosives detonate, they ignite a fusion reaction in the
tritium.   Therefore, the more tritium injected into the nuclear core, the
higher  the yield of the combined fission-fusion explosion.  Typical "dial-a-
yield" bombs weigh 350 kg and yield from 100 kilotons to 1 megaton,  with
selectable yields available in 100 kiloton increments. Enhanced radiation
weapons also appear at TL8.  These yield a  minimum of blast and a massive
burst of neutrons.  They are  designed to inflict a maximum number of
personnel casualties while  minimizing physical damage to the target.
Enhanced radiation  weapons are useful for killing enemy troops in urban areas
while  keeping the destruction of buildings to a minimum.  They are also
highly effective in killing armored vehicle crews while leaving the  vehicles
intact because of the penetrating power of the neutron burst. Weapon sizes
decrease and yields increase as fission and fusion  efficiency becomes higher
with advancing technology.  TL9 tactical  weapons are half the weight and
twice the yield of TL8 bombs as all  components become increasingly
miniaturized. By TL10, the major tactical weapons are miniaturized enhanced
radiation and focused blast bombs.  The former perform much like  their TL8
counterparts, however, their size has been reduced to 50  kilograms. Focused
blast weapons are essentially the nuclear equivalent of  shaped charge weapons
created with advanced tamping technology.   Approximately 70 percent of the
weapon\'s blast effect is focused into  a 30-degree cone with its axis parallel
to the bomb\'s direction of  travel.  These are used to destroy heavily
fortified installations such as  bunker complexes, or against targets
requiring pin-point accuracy  such as dams and bridges, or specific buildings
within a city where a  conventional explosive would be insufficient.  Focused
blast weapons  are available as gravity bombs or as 50-kilogram missile
warheads.   Lighter, more advanced versions are fitted as warheads on standard
 starship missiles. At higher tech levels, tactical bombs are replaced by
drone-fired   collapsing californium missile warheads.   Meson guns eventually
 replace all strategic nuclear bombs except for the highest yielding- planet
busting anti-matter bombs in the 1,000 megaton + range that  become available
at TL 15. Using Nuclear Bombs Tactical nuclear bombs are usually dropped from
low altitude using  one of two methods: Toss Bombing--  The pilot approaches
the target at low altitude and at  a high rate of speed.  During a sharp pull-
up into a vertical climb, the  bomb is released at the proper angle to toss it
at its target in a ballistic  arc.  The pilot reverses course at the top of
the climb and dives back  to low altitude for his escape.  Pilots try to pick
a release point behind  terrain such as a range of hills that will shield them
from the blast as  they make their escape.  Bomb fuses are usually set for air
burst or  ground burst for a tactical toss bombing. Task: To successfully toss-
bomb a target with a nuclear bomb.
 Difficult, Aircraft and Gunnery (Instant, Fateful)
 Referee:  Add aircraft computer level as positive DM.
       +1 DM with Heads Up Display. Laydown Bombing-- This is a low altitude,
high speed tactic using   nuclear bombs equipped with parachute packs.  The
parachute slows  the bomb sufficiently so the aircraft has time to escape
before  detonation.  Bombs may be fused for ground burst or for delayed
detonation. Task:  To successfully make a laydown attack with a nuclear bomb.
 Difficult, Gunnery, Dex (Instant, Fateful)
 Referee:  Add aircraft computer level as positive DM. Nuclear Weapons Effects
The Nuclear Effects Table indicates the effect radius in meters from  ground
zero of several different effects, with different listings for  ground bursts
and air bursts. 1. Crater--  Only ground bursts produce craters.  No
individuals  may enter craters because of extreme radiation levels.  All
targets are  destroyed within craters. 2. Primary Blast Radius-- All
targets within the inner half of the  primary blast radius are destroyed.  All
targets within the outer half are  hit with a penetration of 60 and a damage
rating of 60. 3. Secondary Blast Radius-- All targets in the secondary blast
radius are hit with a penetration of 20 and a damage rating of 20. 4.
Tertiary Blast Radius-- All individuals within the tertiary blast  radius must
roll the following task:
 Task:  To avoid sustaining blast damage
        Difficult, Survival, End (Instant, Fateful)

        Referee:  Individuals under cover receive a DM of +2. 5. Induced
Radiation-- The tertiary blast radius and everything  inside it is
contaminated with induced radiation for 30 minutes after  bomb detonation.
After 30 minutes the area is reduced to that listed  as Induced Radiation.
Unprotected individuals may not enter a  contaminated area.  If they are in
the area, they must leave within 30  minutes or suffer a serious wound with
two characteristics reduced to  zero. Nuclear Effects Table Yield Crater

Greetings fellow travellers.

While programming the population related details of the World Builders
Handbook, I have come across two minor problems.  It occurs on page 
74, step 6.  To quote:

	If a world has a type A, B, or C atmosphere, no native life, and
	its tech level is 9+, then roll 3D-3.  If this roll is less
	than or equal to the world\'s population digit, then techlevel - 6 
	of the population is in permanent orbit.

	if the above is not true, then determine the number and size of
	orbital cities as below:


Now, this seems to contradict itself.  It seems to state that if there
is not techlevel - 6 of the population in orbit, then you are to
determine the number and size of the orbital cities.  Any comments?


Also, a couple of paragraphs later, the following problem shows itself. 
Again, to quote the book:

	For class B starports, there must be 
	at one orbital city (of at least tertiary
	size) no matter how many class B star-
	ports are on the ground.

I believe that this should read as follows:

	For class B starports, there must be 
	only one orbital city (of at least tertiary
	^^^^
	size) no matter how many class B star-
	ports are on the ground.


Again, any comments?


Finally, there is no mention of adding orbital cities if the world has a
normal atmosphere.  I can imagine several situations where a normal
world will have orbital cities.  Are there major reasons that the
current system does not allow this?

2. Tech Level Ruminations by Dan Williams

1. Letter from the Editor

I am in the process of presenting a Trade and Commerce System based on the
excellent articles submitted in earlier digests. I will have the first part
available in about one week. After which I will try to follow up with another
part every week. I will welcome input on all parts so that we as a 
group can establish a Trade and Commerce System that we all find useful.
In the mean time take a look at Dan Williams article it sheds some light on 
the subject of tech level and what exactly does it mean.

**********************************
2. From: salt!china!dan@uunet.uu.net (Dan Williams)
Subject: Re:  Tech Level Ruminations 

Hi I am new to the list also, but I though I might try to add something.
In the computer game star-saga the economic model is for inner worlds to 
be high tech while the outer worlds are seperated and low tech areas with 
a scattering of really advanced technology in spots.  The play continues 
with players taking cheap high tech goods to low tech worlds to trade for 
materials, and taking the raw materials back to the high tech worlds to use
to buy more expensive high tech gadgetry for trade or use by the player.
This is a more normal means of exploitation of cheap low tech labor by high
tech worlds.  Normally there is a need to gear up to a new technology before
it can be utilized by a people.  The tools just aren\'t there to be able to
support high tech industry.  So if a high tech level N factory was planted 
on a low tech level N-3 world and your tech level N Framistat defiburalated
what is the factory to do?  Stop production while a quick messenger fetches 
the necessary part?  Most Businesses can not afford to do this!  
	Of course with enough incentive a business or organization can 
develop the required infrastructure to support itself.  Maybe with goverment 
assistance.  If the raw materials are at the location and it is to costly or 
inconvinient to transport them, and the labor is cheap and plentiful, and the 
goverment will give us a loan for providing "aid" to the locals, then it may
make sense to build training facilities, support bussinesses, public service 
industries, or what ever else you could need to suport yourself.  I would 
expect to find stratification of locals and imported highly trained personnel
happening quickly.  Slums and resentment, ect.  Think of South Africa today 
and how it started.  An extreame example but History does repeat itself.  
If you want a better example think about how the US installed industry in 
Japan, and how Japan has grown to the power it is today from the wreck it 
was after the war. 
	So if you intend to seed a high tech industry on a low tech world you
need to take account of the infra-structure, why the industry is here, 
(labor costs, transport costs, necessity, etc.) how are the natives 
used/treated, and whats in it for the bottom line.
	Comments, observations, or flames encouraged.
Dan Williams

GDW\'s phone number is 309-452-3632 (which is also the combination
to the safe in Research Station Gamma). Digest Group\'s escapes me 
at the moment, but if you check the back cover of any of their
products or the masthead of Travellers Digest I\'m sure you\'ll
find it. Also remember that the DG folks have daytime jobs when you
are deciding when to call them.

While I`m at it here, is there anyone out there who has any
background in enviornmental topics like pollution, the greenhouse
effect, etc.? I have an idea for an adventure which would require
some background of this type which I lack detiled knowledge of.

Greetings, fellow travellers.


I bring you more typos in the World Builder\'s Handbook. :-(


When calculating Technology Related Details, the same error occurs in
two different places.

On page 83, section 4a, Computer/Robotics TL limits.  Also, on page 84,
section 5a, Communications TL limits.  To quote:

	Lower limit: Upper limit / 3 (drop fractions)

It then gives an example:

	A world has an energy upper limit of 14.  The .............
	limits are 14 and 11.

Now, instead of the / they are using the divide symbol, (which is very
confusing with a plus sign, but that is another problem).  I believe
that it should read:

	Lower limit: Upper limit - 3

because they reference these examples several times using the range of 14
and 11.




On a brighter note, I need some input.  Specifically, I need some UWP to
test my program (almost done).

I have created a simple questionaire below.  Enter the information
requested after the colon, and then mail the whole thing to me.  I have
a simple program which will strip out the unnecessary text.  Please do
not delete the question text as I may need it to figure out what is
going on.  I will post interesting (and reasonable) results to the list.

Finally, I still need the phone # for DG.  I got it for GDW.

To Steven Fellows, and anyone else who isn\'t as fanatical about their 
history lessons as yours truly:

The Manipulators\' Club is the most popular Club in the Hive Federation, 
although it\'s also one of the hardest to join. The concept of Manipulation,
and the rules of the Club, are explained in the Alien Module HIVERS.

Shall I go into more detail for the List, or will that be sufficient?

Greetings fellow travellers (its me again).


I have a question which I would like to see a little discussion on.

In the World Builder\'s Handbook it discusses and creates the law
related details.  Frankly, I was a little bit disappointed at this
section since it only has two steps, and the steps are a bit
simplistic.  Anyway, it talks about the uniformity of law, and legal
profile for the entire planet.  Now, when the entire planet is under
one government that makes sense.  However, if the planet is balkanized
and under several different governments, it seems to make sense to me
that the law details should be generated for each government.  Does
anybody have any reasons this should not be (other than the excessive
detail)?

[I have removed a name to protect the guilty, where there is a [*] -- James]

To the List in general:

A lot of people seem to be interested in bits and pieces of Triveller travia, 
uh, Trivialler tra-- oh, the hell with it. Anyway, if the List needs an 
unofficial historian (or, James, an official one), I\'ll be glad to fill the 
gap: I\'ve got access to everything GDW ever put out on the Traveller->MegaT
universe, and almost everything Digest Group has done. There may be people 
with better connections for certain things than I (hi, [*]), but for
historical data and info on the Universe, I\'d be glad to work as a resource.

When I say "historian," I mean historian, of the universe and of developments 
in the game, and not (even if people would listen to me, which I doubt) a 
rules arbiter. If you want to know why people laugh when you say you\'ve gotten
a perfect-condition first printing of HIGH GUARD, or why Cymbeline\'s a
hacker\'s heaven, or whether Hivers have a sense of humor, or who Ek is, or how 
many babies a Vargr mother tends to have in a litter, or even the lowdown on 
who is credited with the discovery that you could have a viable 2G, Jump-2 
ship with a 200 ton hull (and hence invented the Far Trader by accident), I
can answer you gladly. But I will not render judgements on how ANY actual game
rules are supposed to work, as my policy since discovering my first rules
glitch in the original Book 2 in 1978 has been, "Talk fast, wing it, and if
anyone tries to quote the rules at you, kick their character out an airlock,"
which is great for argument-free play sessions but lousy for being able to
quote chapter and verse on tables of data. 

I should warn folks that my database, while huge, is incomplete: I own by no
means all of the stuff belonging to groups other than GDW and DGP, and am
missing several issues of the better-known fanzines. (I need information
contained in Travellers\' Digest Numbers 5-7, for example.) And last but not
least, my research schedule forces me to leave my terminal for weeks at a
time, so there may be backlog on occasion. But I\'ll try to notify James and/or
the List in such cases. 

My memory is excellent but by no means perfect, so I may amend answers to
questions after I\'ve had an opportunity to check the hundred-plus-volume
Metlay Traveller Library. And if I get something wrong, I\'m open to being 
corrected, but flame me at your peril: the last person to flame me was named 
Jim Morrison. And before that it was Elvis, and before that, Jimmy Hoffa.

What do y\'all think?

expectantly,

Hi all;

   HAs anyone noticed the amount that this LIC (Limited liability Imperial
Charter) or more commonly mega-corporation owns. Esp. other mega-corps
such as:

    General Products 26%
    GSbAG            19%
    Instellar Arms   30%
    Ling Standard    26%

These are just a few of the mega-corporations (The above figures quoted from
Mega-Traveller Referee Companion Pg. 40-41). I thought that is was a little
strange, or actually didn\'t expect the numbers to be so high. I can see a
insurance company investing in alot of different things to get a return on
there rates, but this surprised me. What effect does the Rebellion have on
these mega-corps?? I was under the impression that they would like to
maintain the status quo and a LIC such as Hortalez would eventually come into
play in the rebellion. Or would the company try for profits in the war
area, trying to get as much profits as possible? I am probably just
rambling here, but I would be interested in opinions. Also, since Metlay has
offered the services of a librarian, I have one question. Any information on
the Hortalez family. It must be very important family in the fallen Imperium
regardless. I would be interested in using some of this for an adventure
for the characters in my campaign. When you start talking about espionage
and stuff, this is the kind of things I would love to get my character in
the campaign into hot water with. Anyways, enough ramblings for now....

Greetings!

With all the talk about World Builders programs I figured I may as well
announce mine.  I have started work on a system generation program for
2300AD that integrates the best (IMHO) parts of the WBH into the basic
system generation rules of 2300AD.  If there are any 2300AD people out
there who are interested, let me know at CHOINSKI@ENV.PRIME.COM and I
will see what can be done.  There are two things to note, however:

1) I am doing this on my Amiga.  If you have an amiga, you should enjoy it
   since it uses a graphical interface.  (basically, to generate the
   Sol system takes 6 gadget clicks -- one to get the Primary requester,
   three to select the primary\'s type, size and sub-number, one to okay
   the primary, and one to hit the "populate" button -- total time of about
   10 seconds.

2) If you DON\'T have an amiga, I can give you the core routines that actually
   create the system (no graphic interface) as source code.  The code is in
   Modula-2.

To Metlay and all amateur historians:

Yes!  Tell the newer Travellers, like myself, what you know of the history
of the game and the Imperium.  Valuable information, now that so much of the
original development is out of print...

And now, a question!

I\'m running a MegaT campaign in the Spinward Marches (I know, so is everybody
else), and I would like to give my players some "everybody knows this"
information...  There was some mention a few weeks back about some local
nobility in the Marches, and their relationship to Norris.  Are there any other
noble families that "everybody" in the Marches would have heard about?  (Or any
other celebrities for that matter)

Thanks for any info...

Bob Mahoney

Hi de ho.

Well, with the blessing of Our List Admin who Art in Tektronix, I\'ve become
historian for the List. I shall endeavour to do justice to my claims, having 
now put my proverbial foot in it! |->

To work!

To C. Harald: I only do Traveller and MegaTraveller. I consider 2300 to be an 
abomination for two reasons: first, it\'s predicated on Twilight, which is in 
turn predicated on the utterly fallacious and dangerously stupid concept of a
limited and survivable nuclear war, and second, it looked like a positively
fascinating future history until they introduced the Kafers and blew it to
hell. Besides, if this List covers 2300 I\'m not aware of it. And thanks for 
the suggestion; Gerry and I have been GenCon pals for umpteen years now, and 
he may well be able to help me. Does he have an Email address, or should I 
(gasp) pick up the phone? I owe him a call anyway....

On the Hortalez family: there is virtually no data in the public domain on 
these families that I know of. I believe that they\'ve been deliberately set up 
but left vague as a basis for future adventure ideas. You should do whatever 
you want with them, and keep us posted! Also, there are so many 
subcorporations of Hortalez, each larger than anything on Earth these days, 
that you can easily "cauterize" your adventure if it turns out later that 
you\'ve done something wildly against "prevailing wisdom." I use a lot of 
feeder corporations in my games, as industrial espionage is a blast 
(literally). 

On Manipulation: the Hiver concept of manipulation began thousands of years 
ago, when the Hivers were first developing into city-states. The first 
Manipulator, known to humans as M. Primus, suggested that a road be built 
across a populated peninsula, linking several citystates together. This, he 
said, would provide better markets and less food spoilage in transit. The road 
was built, and within a few years, use of it had blended the cultures of the 
various citystates to the point where it was decided to form a single nation. 
Primus, at that point, stood up and revealed a sealed document, years old, 
that stated that he had planned for this to happen all along! The people were 
shocked and amazed, and overnight the concept of manipulation became a strong 
facet of Hiver intellectual pursuit. (What happened to Primus? Well, some say 
he was elected president; others say he was lynched. C\'est la vie.)
	Since then, the Manipulators\' Club on Guaran, and later on Glea, has 
listed Manipulations and accorded the status of Manipulator to worthy 
applicants. A "legal" Manipulation must fulfill the following criteria:

1. It must be designed on two levels, a superficial level with superficial 
effects, and a deeper level with unstated yet definite goals.

2. The parties being manipulated must remain unaware of the manipulation at 
all times during the course of the manipulation.

3. The entire manipulation, with a full prediction of superficial and deep 
effects and processes, must be filed with the Manipulators\' Club before the 
manipulation begins, and must not be opened until the applicant tells the Club 
to do so, usually as part of a package of evidence demonstrating that the 
manipulation has been completed successfully.

As an example, my player, David, has always been fascinated with the Hivers, 
and in our first non-Spinward-Marches campaign he jumped at the chance to run 
one, but eventually decided to take a human instead for other reasons. 
However, the concept of manipulation appealed to him, so he elected to try to 
become a Manipulator. He took the film crew of which he was producer, and made 
a documentary on the unstable political situation on a world in the Solomani 
Rim. Ostensibly, this was to inform the public and encourage sentiment to get 
the Imperium to intercede. Of course, the Imperium did no such thing, but the 
megacorporation from which he\'d been fired years earlier got a copy of the 
film, and decided to exploit the situation for their own ends. The problem was 
that a Scout team caught them worsening the situation, and the vice president 
in charge of the operation (who\'d fired this guy at the age of 27) was hauled 
before an Imperial High Justice Tribunal. The irony of it all was that to nail 
this guy, he exploited the suffering of an entire planet, and if the situation 
had taken one more year to mature, the Rebellion would have ruined everything! 
The upshot was that the Manipulators\' Club on Glea received his package, 
looked at it carefully, and now his name is no longer Iscin Delano Jaeger, 
it\'s M. Iscin Delano Jaeger! (He tells everyone the "M" stands for "Mister".)
Sick, huh? I love this stuff! |->

One final note: I\'m looking into a membership in the HIWG, the History of the 
Imperium Working Group, for myself. This will give me access to history and 
development as it\'s being written, and will enable things not in the usual 
literature to be disseminated (with due credit to the HIWG, of course) to the 
List. Two questions, though: Is anyone on the List a member, and/or does 
anyone know how "Official" the HIWG\'s work is? I\'ve heard it\'s considered 
gospel, but haven\'t had this confirmed yet.

Well, that\'s it for this report, folx. Keep asking them there questions, and 
let me leave you with the answer to my first rhetorical question on the list I 
gave last time: You\'ll get laughed at for buying a first printing of HIGH 
GUARD because it was wrong practically from cover to cover; the second 
printing corrected so many errata that it was literally a brand-new book.

Later,

Bob:

I\'m assuming you\'re looking for "gospel" famous types, right? I mean, Near Miss
is a lot more famous than most people in the Marches, but GDW hasn\'t picked up
their option yet, so I\'m stuck. |->

Well, let\'s see. There\'s Leonard Bolden-Tukera, Marquis of Aramis, a profligate
butthead whose wife is a Tukera heiress and who supports the illegal activities
of Tukera and its interface line Akerut as long as he gets paid off regularly.
There\'s Marc hault-Oberlindes, Baron of Feri and president of Oberlindes Lines,
a slick little shipping firm that\'s been burning Akerut out of its business in 
the Regina subsector for years and is expanding into the Aramis subsector now.
There\'s the Leader of Roup, whose primary claim to fame is that when he tells
people to do something, they do it. And there\'s the Matriarch of Mora, about 
whom more in a recent issue of Travellers\' Digest.

As for other celebs, there aren\'t too many. But if I ever get around to putting
my Near Miss stories onto the List, you\'ll meet a few who might transplant well
to your campaign, some serious and others lighthearted (Her Grace the Duchess
Samantha Vanderkloot, owner of the famous Vanderkloot Diamond and the even more
famous Vanderkloot Cleavage, and her archrival Dame Lucretia Blithering-Snipe).

I\'ll flip through the lit and see what else I can find. If you\'re desperate,
you can always throw in (gak) Akidda Laagir and his band of incompetents....|->

I\'m working on a pirate/treasure hunt scenario that will take
place in the Trojan Reach.
  For three years now, a friend and I have been running a campaign
wherein all the players were serving members of the Imperial Navy.
They\'re based on Wonstar in the  Five Sisters sub-sector, and have
been  suppressing  piracy in  District 268,  saving Candory from a
nefarious Zhodani plot and several other things.
  We now want to extend operations into the Trojan Reach, and have
been extrapolating data from the Imperial Atlas  and various other
very skimpy sources.  Now, recently I noticed an ad in an issue of
Travellers Digest  for a  canadian fanzine called  Third Imperium.
The ad states that, among other things, each issue contains a sub-
sector of The Trojan Reach.
  I\'m very much interested in getting hold of whatever information
is contained in these issues. Is there anyone who will help me get
it?  Either by mailing me the world data or photocopies of the re-
levant pages? Or, if back-issues are still available, buy them and
send them to me.  I will  of course reimburse  your expenses  (but
check with me electronically first,  I\'m not interested in getting
several sets of Third Imperium from different people).  I\'ve had a
friend look for this  fanzine in californian games shops,  but the
ones he has found  stocks  very few  american fanzines,  let alone
canadian. Does anyone know of a good games shop in the LA area?

Hans, the Trojan Reach near the Imperial Border is called the Outrim Void.
I don\'t know how "official" the Third Imperium stuff is, but the Egyrn and
Pax Rulin subsectors are detailed to great accuracy in GDW\'s Adventure 4,

No history archives for two weeks, as I am going to (ugh) Notre Dame to do
an experiment at the Physics Dept. (for anyone on the list who\'s unlucky
enough to actually live in South Bend, I\'ll be at the Randall Inn; call and
ask for Mr. Metlay, and leave your number) I\'ll gather and clear away any 
history questions that come up over the next two weeks when I get back.

see y\'all in a fortnight,

metlay

I need information on the planet Victoria/Lanth. The info I seek is in JTAS #2
I believe. Would be obliged if someone could post a copy or USMAIL a Xerox
I will cover postage costs etc.

More MT starships next time...

Greetings fellow travellers,


This is the only star system I was sent.  I am not sure if it came
through the mailing list, or if it was sent directly by James Perkins.

Please, I need a few more.  This showed up a small problem which I was
able to fix, but I would like to test it with a few more/

I ran it through the program two times, so you will be able to see
the differences between two different runs.

Check the "Best of the Journal" which reprinted the best articles
from JTAS. Problem is, the Best ofs are now themselves out of
print.

I have a complete collection of JTAS; I\'m willing to copy
articles, just let me know your "real mail" address so I
can send it.

By the way, Mike, how do you find time to run a game and be a 
grad student at the same time? Between class work and my assistantship,
I hardly have time to breathe. Have you cloned youself? If
so, how can I get one (of myself that is).

Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

Traveller\'s Digest (#11?) relates in one of it\'s "Rebel Reporter" articles
that Strephon used two look-alikes, a robot, and a clone.  Lucan and Dulinor
maintain that the "Real" Strephon is the robot...

Has HIWG/GDW/DP made any decisions about the actual facts in this case?
(I personally like the idea of a legitimate Emperor stuck out in the cold,
trying to convince people he\'s himself.)

My player\'s are heading in this Strephon\'s direction, and I would like to avoid
making decisions that might be complicated by a later "official" product I
might want to use.  Does anyone have any facts, or even strong opinions about
this?

Thanks much.

Greetings fellow travellers,


A general question:  Is there anybody out there who is NOT using the
shattered Imperium as the basis for their campaign?  A group of us are
thinking about using a different history as a basis, and were wondering
if anybody else is doing it.

	Well, neither DGP nor GDW has make a decision on this. They think it
should be left to the GM to decide. In my game, he is actully a clone.
But in some of the games my friends run, he is the real thing.

Ted Kim <tek@penzance.cs.ucla.edu> and I have been discussing the *real*
star system generation program. It generates star systems comparable
to our own (all have 1 star and about 10 planets), and the generation
is based upon current astrophysical knowledge. Since neither Ted nor I
are astrophysics experts, we\'d like to know the following:

1) what classifies a star type (eg. sol is a G-type star, what\'s that mean?)
   Also, what are the other classes of stars and what does that mean for 
   the star system (I think it has something to do with star burn rates).

2) Are there any physics/astronomy/astrophysics people out there who
   could tell us what a *real* binary/trinary star system would look
   like (\'yes\' and \'no\' are *not* appropriate answers :-).

3) Ar there any other star system types that are known to exist aside
   from the stardard unary/binary/trinary systems? (Ringworld and Dyson
   sphere systems are man/being-made and can be anything we want them
   to be). 

4) what does "Planet\'s rotation is in a resonant spin lock with the star"
   mean?


Thanks for any help.

I\'m a little rusty on my astronomy hobby, but here goes.

> 1) what classifies a star type (eg. sol is a G-type star, what\'s that mean?)
>    Also, what are the other classes of stars and what does that mean for

Stars are classified by many things.  The most important factors in
stars are mass, composition, and distance from the observer.  From these
everything else can be deduced:

Basic Stellar Factors:

	Mass: Stars vary from 1/100 to 100 times the Sun\'s mass.  At
	certain cataclysmic times in their lives, stars will lose mass
	(from 10% to 99% of their starting mass).  Sometimes stars will
	scoop up mass from the atmosphere of a nearby companion.  Most
	stars are about 10-20% of the sun\'s mass.  Stars larger than the
	sun get progressively rarer, mostly due to their short lifetimes.

	Composition: Stars start out with about 75% Hydrogen and 25%
	Helium.  Stars formed from the ashes of earlier stars which have
	Nova\'ed may have dust formed from elements Iron and lighter.
	Stars formed from the ashes of Supernovae (like most stars in
	our galaxy today) are further enriched with elements heaver than
	Iron.  Composition is the single most important factor which
	causes stars to age.  As stars age they fuse the Hydrogen nuclei
	into Helium nuclei.  Stars somewhat more massive (>1.4 Solar
	masses) can develop the core pressure to burn the Helium into
	Carbon, Carbon into Neon, Magnesium, and so on up to Iron.  The
	smaller stars (<1.4 Solar masses) run out of fuel, blow off
	their outer layers, and cool into a naked degenerate matter core
	called a white dwarf.  The larger stars run out of fuel, blow
	off their outer layers in a supernova, and press all the
	electrons and nuclei together (in the naked core) called a
	neutron star.  Or maybe a black hole.

	Distance from observer: affect the apparent brightness of the
	star.  Naturally it has no effect on the intrinsic brightness of
	the star.

Resultant factors:

	Core Temperature: A function of mass and composition.  A few
	million degrees Kelvin is necessary to fuse Hydrogen.  Several
	hundreds of millions of degrees are necessary to create Iron.
	Temperature (and Pressure) of that magnitude can only be
	achieved in the most massive stars.  The core temperature and
	pressure is increased by gravitional collapse, and decreased by
	the radiation pressure of the gamma rays generated by fusing
	elements.  As the fusion rates increase, the core expands,
	reducing the temperature and pressure, causing the fusion rate
	to decrease.  This steady state is why stars burn at a steady
	rate.  Very massive stars have stronger gravity-pressure to
	overcome, so they reactions stabilize at vastly higher reaction
	rates.

	Size: The girth of the star is determined most importantly by
	its composition and core temperature.  Most normal composition,
	that is, main sequence stars (type V) are compact, that is,
	about 1-10 million km in size.  Stars made of white-dwarf matter
	are subcompact (Earth size), and neutron stars are microcompact
	-- only a few km (say 15 or so) across.  Red giants, where the
	core temperature is very high and is goading fusion reactions on
	the star\'s surface, are bloated out to 100 million to 1 billion
	km in size.

	Surface Temperature: A function of mass and size.  Most surface
	temperatures are in the 3000K-45000K range.  Sol burns at about
	5600K.  Redder "colors" are cool, 3000-4000K.  Yellow is
	5000-7000K, White is 8000-15000K, and the hotter stars have a
	distinctly bluish tint.  This is because the photosphere
	(deepest visible layer of the star) radiates like a black body,
	in a continuous bell-curve of luminosity vs. wavelength.  White
	dwarfs tend to be whitish, Red Giants bloated by high core
	temperatures and high-atmosphere hydrogen burning are very cool
	on the surface.

	Luminosity: The intrinsic brightness of the star; it\'s total
	energy output.  This is a function of the star\'s size and its
	surface temperature.  White dwarfs are hot and very small, so
	they are dim.  Neutron stars are hotter still and tinier still,
	so they are even dimmer.  Red Giants are cool but very large, so
	they tend to be very bright.  Stars range from 10000 to
	1/10000\'th the luminosity of Sol.

Observable information:

	Apparent magnitude: How bright the star looks from your
	backyard.  A combination of luminosity degraded by distance.
	This is a logarithm of the apparent brilliance of the star.  Sol
	is magnitude -26 or so, the Moon, about -16, Sirius A (brightest
	star) is -1.6, Alpha Centauri A, about 1.0, dimmest observable
	with unaided human eye, about 6.0, Sirius B (white dwarf), about
	15.0.

	Absolute magnitude: Magnitude of star if it were brought to a
	fixed distance of 10 parsecs.  I think the Sun would be around
	magnitude 4.0.

	Color Index: The degree of blueness or redness of the star as
	measured by comparing the brightness of the star from two
	photographs, one taken through blue and the other through a red
	filter.

	Spectrum: A spectrograph is used to look at the emission of the
	star at each visible wavelength.  The bell curve of black-body
	radiation is most evident (hotter stars are bluer, colder are
	redder).  On closer examination, dark and bright lines can be
	distinguished.  The dark lines are caused by gases in the star\'s
	atmosphere absorbing light from the lower layers; the bright
	lines are emissive gases in the star\'s atmosphere.  The exact
	position of the lines map out the composition of the stars to
	observing scientists.  Hot stars tend to have very understated
	emission/absorption lines, whereas the cooler stars have very
	pronounced absorption lines.

	The spectral class of the star attempted to classify the stars
	from the spectral lines, and originally we had type A through
	type S stars, with type W Wolf-Rayet stars too.  After much
	studying and theorizing, they realized everything was screwed
	up.  They threw out most of the letters as meaningless, and came
	up with the order O B A F G K M, which classifies normal (type
	V) stars in order of decreasing temperature and size.  For finer
	degrees of measurement, a decimal was added.  Hence Sol is 2/10
	of the way from G0 to K0, a G2 star.

Stellar lifecycles:

	Formation: all stars form from clouds of dust and gas.  Areas of
	the clouds will be more dense, and the stronger gravity there
	draws in surrounding gas, etc., until a proto-star system is
	born.  Often the central mass will have other similarly sized
	clumps gathered with it.  This is a multi-star system.  Others
	may not, like the Sol system.  Any tiny planets tend to clump
	together as the star is warming up.  Eventually the star heats
	up really good and blows away most of the dust and gas around
	it.  Often the young star burns off the volatiles from the
	close-in planets, while the outer ones maintain their hydrogen
	and helium envelopes (gas giants).

	Main Sequence Life: About this time it probably emerges from the
	cluster (in the case of galactic clusters) or spiral arm and
	enters the long-term hydrogen-burning steady state "main
	sequence".  The star spends most of its life converting hydrogen
	into helium, at modest core temperatures.  This is the time a
	star is considered "type V".  For Sol, this is around 10 billion
	years.  For more massive stars, much less time (higher core
	temperatures and much greater burning).  Sirius A, a class A
	star, probably will last 200 million years or so.  For less
	massive stars (class M), 40-50 billion years.

	Uh-oh, low on gas: When the star runs low on hydrogen, the core
	will no longer be able to support itself against gravity, and
	will shrink, compressing and heating up.  The hydrogen outside
	the core, what ther is, starts burning like crazy.  The intense
	heat of this causes the star to bloat hugely into a red giant.

	Small Stars: In small stars (1.4 Solar masses or less), the core
	will tend to continue collapsing into a state of degenerate
	matter called a white dwarf.  The remnant core will then blow
	off the outer layers of the star into a "plentary nebula".  The
	inert dwarf, just hot matter with no energy generation, will
	slowly cool over billions of years, going from spectral class B
	or so down to M and below (a black dwarf).

	Large Stars: The core will collapse futher and further until it
	gets hot enough to fuse the plentiful helium ash into carbon.
	The star has a new lease on life, but the intense temperatures
	makes the helium burn very quickly and it lasts only 1/10 to
	1/100 as long as the hydrogen lasted.  When it runs out, the
	story is repeated.  THe core collapses until it is hot enough
	for carbon to fuse.  The star is like an onion, with hydrogen
	burning on the surface, helium below, carbon below that.  This
	can\'t go on forever.  When the star reaches Iron, it cannot fuse
	any more to gain energy.

	Neutron Star: at this point the core continues collapsing until
	the electrons, protons, and neutrons are crushed into a gigantic
	ball of neutrons 10-30 km across, the rest of the star falling
	in around it.  Suddenly the core stops collapsing, and the
	infalling matter crashes against the core, rebounding with a
	gigantic shock wave which is crushed out before it can leave the
	star.  At this point heavy elements are created by crushing the
	iron and lighter nuclei together.  A massive burst of neutrinos
	is the neutron core\'s shockwave of its own.  The neutrinos,
	unlike photons, mostly pass through the matter of the star, but
	those that do collide into the star\'s matter heat it violently
	and the star\'s outer 95% rends itself away from the core.  This
	is called a Supernova.  The remnant is a neutron star.  If the
	star was very massive, the neutron star will collapse at this
	point into a black hole.

	The Remnant: The supernova remnant is highly enriched in heavy
	elements.  Undoubtedly the gases and dusts will be swept into
	more star formation in a few million or billion years.  Think of
	the gold in the switches in your computer terminal.  Yep, those
	came out of a supernova long before the solar system formed.

I suggest going to a star party and asking to see a couple
binaries/trinaries.  There are many paintings by artists depicting life
on a planet ruled by binary/trinary star systems.  Read "Nightfall"
(don\'t see the movie) by Larry Niven and ???..  Look for art in
"Cosmos", by Carl Sagan.

Other than multi-star systems and globular and galactic clusters, there
aren\'t really any other kinds of systems.  Globular clusters are
ancient, one-shot star formations of several million stars, very poor in
heavy elements.  Galactic clusters (and galactic arms) are full of dust,
gas, and radiation.  They are full of young, hot, massive stars that go
"pop" and raise a lot of radiation.

> 4) what does "Planet\'s rotation is in a resonant spin lock with the star"

Mercury is an example.  It is in an eccentric orbit, and contains uneven
distribution of mass within itself.  It revolves around the Sun in 88
days, and rotates in 59 days.  Note the 3:2 ratio, a ratio of small
integers.  This has happened because of a resonance; when Mercury is
closest to the Sun, the lowest energy state is when the mass
concentrations on Mercury closest to the Sun.  The Moon is a similar
case in it\'s orbit around earth, only the ratio is 1:1.  This effect is
usally felt only when the objects are fairly close to one another, and
have been orbiting for a long, long time.

       			   TRADE AND COMMERCE SYSTEM

This is a prototype of the new proposed trade and commerce system. This
has been culled from suggestions from various sources. Most notably
Mark Power and Edwin Wiles, thank you for your input. I hope that 
I haven\'t munged your ideas. :) 
I have placed the events in the same order that they are in the 
Mega-Traveller Book. I have repeated the unchanged portions to save 
GMs from having to look in two places for the information. There 
are very few if any changes in the first few steps, I have commented 
on some things that I think that need to be considered for change in 
the future. The real changes have happened in the Purchasing area. 
I have a purchase table and sale table and a goods table format. 
Most of the numbers are arbitrary. In other words I made them up. 
If you have suggestions send them to me and not the net. I would 
like to see this generate some new article for the digest. If I do 
not hear anything in the next week, I will give you the next part 
of the installments.

Greg
  
Steps for TRADE AND COMMERCE:
=============================

1. Source World Details
- ----
Determine sourceworld\'s Population and Tech Level.


2. Destination World Details
- ----
The ship captain must select and designate a destination world within
jump range. Determine destination worlds Population, Tech Level, and
travel zone.

3. Shipments
- ----
Passengers are determined at Step 4. Cargo and Freight are both
determined beginning at step 5.

4. Passengers
- ----
Determine how many passengers are available for the ship.
Roll once on the High column
Once on the Middle column
Once on the Low column


  
				PASSENGER TABLE

============================================================================
WORLD DIGIT		HIGH		MIDDLE		LOW
============================================================================

	9		3D-1D		3D		5D
	A		3D		4D		6D

DMs: If destination world Population 0-4, DM -3. If destination world
Population 8+, DM +1.

If any crewmember has STEWARD skill, apply it as a +DM on the roll for
High passengers.

If any crewmember has ADMIN skill, apply it as a +DM on the roll for
Middle passengers.

If any crewmember has STREETWISE skill, apply it as a +DM on the roll
for Low passengers.

DM +(sourceworld TL minus destination world TL).

If destination world is RED ZONE, DM -12, and no Middle or Low
Passengers. 

If destination world is an AMBER ZONE, DM -6

Passengers may not exceed the passenger capacity of the ship. 

This table may be consulted once per week.

INCOME: Credit the ship with:

Cr 10,000 per High passenger,
Cr  8,000 per Middle passenger,
Cr  1,000 per Low passenger.

[One thing that was discussed is the possibility of charging different
prices for different length jumps. This should be considered a
possibility and I will have an optional table in future articles. I think
that a standard X per jump is a bit much and X per trip not enough. I
would like to see a sliding scale, something similar to what toadys
airlines have. Obviously the above table is the simplest, but not the
most realistic. - Greg]

5. FREIGHT AND CARGO
==========================

Freight consists of paid shipments of goods. Cargo is purchased at the
sourceworld and destination world. Determine the available lots from
the table. Roll once in the major column, once in the minor column,
and once in the incedental column. For each lot determine its size by
rolling the lot size.

				AVAILABLE LOTS
			      ==================

POP		__________Available at Sourceworld________________
DIGIT
		MAJOR			MINOR		INCIDENTAL

0		----			----		----
1		1D-4			1D-4		----
2		1D-2			1D-1		----
3		1D-1			1D		----
4		1D			1D+1		----
5		1D+1			1D+2		----
6		1D+2			1D+3		1D-3	
7		1D+3			1D+4		1D-3
8		1D+4			1D+5		1D-2
9		1D+5			1D+6		1D-2
A		1D+6			1D+7		1D

LOT SIZE: 

MAJOR CARGO:   1D+10 MINOR CARGO: 1D+5 [I have included optional lot
sizes on the cargo determination tables below. This chart could be
used or we can get develop a system where each entry on the purchase
table will have its own range of lot size. I think I like the second
method better, but it will mean some sort of modifier list to be
applied probable based on population. I will work on such a table.

MAJOR FREIGHT: 1D+10 MINOR FREIGHT: 1D+5 
Lot size is stated in displacement tons. To convert to kiloliters,
multiply by 13.5

DMs: If destination world is Population 0-4, DM -3. If destination
world is Population 8+, DM +1. If any crew member has LIAISON skill,
apply it as a +DM on the roll for minor cargos. DM +(sourceworld TL
minus destination world TL). If destination world is red zone, there
is no freight. If the goods are freight (carried for a fee of Cr1000
per ton) and their identity does not matter, ignore further steps. 
The sum of cargo and freight cannot exceed the cargo hold capacity 
of the ship.

This table shows the limit of freight and cargo available to a ship 
in a period of one week. A crewmember with Broker skill may consult
this table again once (to find last minute cargo but not frieght).

PURCHASING
- ----
1) Determine number of available cargos. [ Dependent on starport and
   population? I do not have a table for starport and population, if
   someone out there has some suggestions let me know. - Greg] 

2) Determine specific cargos.  Involves a certain amount of searching
   on the part of the players.  Referee rolls on appropriate table for
   trade class.  


[I have a small (really) sample of what I am working on. I would like as
much input as you can give. Most of the numbers are based on Book 2 old 
Traveller base prices, but are actually rather arbitrary.]

[Here is what I have.

This is a suggested table of goods in a new format. This format will allow the 
referee to modify and add more detail to the cargos available. 
I have started with Mega-Traveller Table 10a, I have an entry for Lot size, 
but this could be optional and you can use the table above. As you can see this
table will take some time to establish and I would like input on what you see.
If you feel that this will not work let me know. I think that we have a rough 
beginning here and I know that I need more input. - Greg]

Regarding the (probably unlamented) dead topic of game copyrights,
I have seen a full copy of the PATENT on the monopoly game.  Its claims are
very specific as to how the game operates, but also has some breadth, such
that Parker Bros may be able to extort some vigourish out of similar games
created to promote other cities.  If anyone wants the number of the patent,
and doesn\'t have a game box handy, I can step down to the operating systems
group and check the copy.  (Jim did a contract automating the patent office
search system, and pulled copies of patents that intrigued him, including
Samuel L. Clemen\'s patent adjusable belt buckle; or was it a garter?)

Our group and one on the west coast have been using for 10 years now a
campaign in the TL 9 to 12 range set in a non-standard post-imperial-fall
future history.  Paul Gazis (PhD Astrophysics, MIT, now with Voyager at JPL)
created both the campaign setting -- modeled after the long-boat raiding
in dark-age europe -- and the Traveller rules variants in use in both
campaigns.  The east coast campaign is set in a barbarous back-water, the
Scarp region, of the parent-campaign; the two GMs coordinate historical
fluxes between the campaigns, such that a couple of wars from the other 
campaign are about to redirect our commercial/exploration campaign.
    Paul\'s rules modifications consisted of:
* Skill learning system, not unlike that presented in Cosmos by J.Redden,`
   which Paul credits to Mike Yoder and the Eastern Isles campaign of
   Warren Dew, Frank Adams, &co at MIT & DC etc.  (A very low-tech medieval
   game with several games-masters for different islands, which now runs
   in multiple cities on the east coast.)
* Character generation tables for different sub-services and countries,
   not unlike Mercenary/HighGuard but moreso and completed (to all classes)
   sooner.
* Ship construction, maintenance, operation, and combat which didn\'t offend
   an astrophysicist, but are usable by non-technical players.
* stars live in 3-space, based rougly on the known structure of our galactic
  arm (the Scarp is just this side of the Orion nebula; major, old imperial
  space stations are located on the arm\'s fringes nearest tangencies to earth)
  Space combat, however, is done either as chalk-board vectors or kriegspieled
  verbally.

His rules variants have been serially published in The Wild Hunt, a role-
playing APA (Amateur Press Association) run by Mark Swanson.  I can provide
information to anyone who\'d like more...

I once ran a campaign for a short time based on post-holocaust Earth (this
was before the advent of Twilight 2000/Traveller 2300).  It was totally
different from any other Traveller game that I have played.  I based it on
the premise that the Third World War was truly devasting and led to wild
mutations, etc.  That way I could throw in some curves (monsters).  I even
took some Gamma World monsters and converted them into Traveller form (it
was actually very simple to do).

Here\'s how the campaign went:

The character (in my case there was only one player) started out in post-
holocaust Earth fighting to survive.  He had quite a few skills and great
physical attributes, but no technical training (imagine a barbarian, only
tougher and smarter).  This was, of course, due to the daily rigors of
survival in a post-holocaust Earth.

After a bit of time spent just trying to survive and rebuilding some of
Earth\'s cities, the character came upon a crashed spaceship.  Exploring
the ship was somewhat hazardous and didn\'t reveal much anyway, but
eventually the owners of the ship came looking for it.  They had known
about the war on Earth, but were "too late" to stop it, and didn\'t know
that life was returning to the planet, or, in fact, that anyone was still
alive.  This is what the character was told, at least.  What actually
happened was that the alien race had seen the impending menace of humanity
and used their guile to cause a nuclear conflict on the Earth.  They were
quite upset at the fact that humanity had managed to start rebuilding so
soon (the character had played a big role in this earlier).

Rather than tipping their hands, the aliens pretended to be "friends" and
offered to help rebuild what was left of humanity.  We never finished the
campaign, but it was left off with the human leaders willing to accept
the aliens\' aid without question, but the character was already starting
to get suspicious about certain discrepancies in the aliens\' stories.  The
aliens also used slave labor from conquered races, and the character would
eventually have discovered this, since he was learning to use the alien
technology alot faster than he let on.  One interesting twist is that the
aliens had used the war as an excuse to grab tens of thousands of humans,
which they had bred and used as slave labor.  By this point there were
millions of humans being used as slaves throughout the nearby stars.

I made a great effort to use real nearby stars when devising this campaign
in order to add a more realistic feel (the Near Star List would have been
a great help at that time).  With any luck, the character would have
discovered a rebellion ready to happen among many slaves, and maybe even
saved a few humans along the way.  Actually, the character would be more
likely crossed by human slaves than by other aliens -- humans are less
reliable than most races.

It was an interesting campaign -- too bad we both left for college and
never got to finish it.

By the way, this was a long time ago, so I don\'t remember any of the
details, although I probably still have my campaign notes somewhere...

P.S.  If you were looking for a history where, for instance, the Third
Imperium survived, then simply use the old Traveller setting.  Many
campaigns developed in that setting (including some I\'ve been in).  I\'m
sure that many people who had already developed elaborate campaigns
didn\'t want to screw them up by introducing the Shattered Imperium.  A
common one I have seen is the Solomani Revolt, where Earth decides
enough is enough and kicks some Imperial ass.  I personally liked the
idea of a conquered Earth.  In my campaigns in the Third Imperium, the
people of Earth were actually happier under Third Imperium rule, since
they had been tired of fighting and didn\'t really care who ran the
government anyway.  (Of course there were some who would have preferred
home rule anyway. 8-)

Hi there in Traveller Land...
 
	I used to play Traveller a while back, and I\'ve finally gotten
into another campaign.  I\'m about to start a character who is very
techie oriented and will hopefully come up with a lot of odd, off the
wall devices.  He\'s starting on a world with TL12, maybe up to 13 or 14
on the black market, and no laws.  He\'ll have about 4-5 five weeks
before the other players (in transit) arrive, so I\'m going to get some
stuff together. 
 
	I want to ask for advice and recommendations from the list,
because I\'m not completely familiar with the rules (this is old
Traveller) nor with all of the expansions/alternates.  I\'m interested in
advice or suggestions on the gadgets I\'m going to make, suggestions on
more gadgets to make, and information on stuff that\'s already out there
in rules form but I haven\'t run into it yet.

	One thing I\'d like is an idea of what kind of stuff is
available, mainly at TL12, with some stuff edging up into TL13.  The
rules I have aren\'t too detailed, and I definitely remember things
like holocameras, etc, which aren\'t detailed in my rules.

Hand Computers

	In this game the HandComputers are very nice, from an article
in a Traveller Digest the GM has.  I very much reccommend this article
(I only wish we had the stuff it talks about in there now!) in which
it outlines some of the things hand computer can do, and some of the 
services available to hand computers via packet radio transmissions
(including e-mail, possibility of hacking into the system to track
down somebody by their handcomp, various information services
available, etc). 

	One thing it doesn\'t do much about is software available for
hand computers, and how they can be used, but I guess that can be figured
out as needed, although if there are any such articles I\'d appreciate
hearing about them. 

Implant Chip

	I remember seeing something called an Implant chip, or something
similar, in an issue of the TASJ, which enabled a character to hook up
directly to the computers.  I\'m going to try to get one for my
character, and then use it to interface with my handcomputer and use it
more efficiently.

Eyephone shades 

	If I can\'t get one of those, I\'m going to put together a set of
eyephones built into a pair of goggles or shades - eyephones exist
today, and are a pair of LCD screens which fit over your eyes and give
you a color 3D view of a virtual world - different people are developing
them for different reasons, I suppose, but I heard the most about them
in relation to something Autodesk (I think) is coming out with, a
virtual reality system using eyephones and a dataglove as the
input/output device.  
 
	These eyephones will be built into a set of wraparound
sunglasses, and will have input from the handcomputer to the screens, 
or from a tiny set of cameras, thus rendering them effectively
"transparent" to me so I can see out.  Minor options include a
rear-view option, and perhaps image processing.  The main reason for
the eyephones is to be able to display information from my
handcomputer for me.

	Then I can feed information in either through a set of
contacts to monitor my brainwaves (far-fetched, but perhaps possible
in TL12, what do I know?) or more realistically, through an
"eye-cursor" a system which tracks whichever spot I\'m looking at, puts
a cursor there on the screen, then I can hit enter by blinking in a
special way, etc.  This enables me to do stuff without appearing to,
and to access my Handcomputer without overtly doing anything.              
 
Getting into the Rat Race...

	A series of rodent-sized robots.  They would be equipped with
certain capabilities, the range increasing with the TL and the
development. At first they\'d basically be little programmable rodents
that go around and record stuff and carry out orders (through their
computer, or from a comlink) and can self-destruct with a demolitions
charge to destroy the evidence or a target.  

	As I get better, I\'d add things like an electronic lockpick, a
tiny laser cutter to let them make their own mouse-holes, the ability
to tap into a ships computer and dump schematics so they can find
their way around, perhaps even the ability to dump a virus into the
ships computer so they are ignored by sensors.  Of course, the higher
the TL, the smarter the programming. 
 
	Any suggestions?  Feedback?  Ideas for more whacked out gadgets?
Let me hear from you!

Well, in our 2300AD campaign, we have some tech stuff which is quite useful
to us:

Subderma-Talk

	These are small, multichannel communicators implanted in the
	body. The main radio unit is located somewhere in the left shoulder,
	with the antenna running down the back. The radio is connected to a
	throat implant mike and an implanted ear-piece. It draw power from
	the contraction and dilation of the blood vessels in the shoulder,
	and from shoulder movement. You turn the transmitter/receiver on/off
	and select channels using unusual jaw movements.

	Range is quite short and power is low (easy to jam), but the throat
	mike is capable of detecting minute vibrations and amplifying them
	so that you can \'whisper without any sound\' and still be picked up.
	For this reason, the system has been named Telepathy; you can read
	other PC\'s minds!

Subderma-Comp

	This is a computer (processor and static memory) implanted in the
	back of the neck. It has the same capabilities of a standard
	portable computer. It \'displays\' information by interfacing directly
	with either the optic nerve or the visual processing centers of the
	brain (I\'m not sure which); the effect is similar to a heads-up
	display. You communicate with the computer by typing on an imaginary
	keyboard (there is a pressure switch to disable this...). There is
	also a jack located on the surface of the skin which allows direct
	connection to a portacomp for software transfers and easier use.

	Having a powerful computer always available to you (even when
	stripped of all equiptment) is useful...

Subderma-Modem

	Naturally, we quickly came up with a way to link the computers to
	the radios so that we can communicate large amounts of data between
	implanted computers and otherwise interface with the outside world
	in situations where using the implanted jack is impossible.


An alien race in 2300AD grows various useful devices. One that all PCs wear
constantly is bio-contacts. These are like ordinary contact lenses (they
will correct your vision if necessary). However, by using various different
squint commands, you can get up to 5X magnification, light intensification,
infra-red sight, etc. Also built in are brightness dampers; you never need
sunglasses and they are fast enough to react to most sudden flashes (e.g.
explosions, lasers in the eye, etc).

Two of our PC\'s, the robotics expert and the explosives expert got together
and built a bunch of these. They are (of course) programmable with commands
sent from the subdermacomps via subdermatalk. They can transmit low-res
pictures, move around, and can carry small explosives packs. They can also
be programmed to act autonomously (i.e. drive to this location, record for 5
minutes, then destruct). They are incredibly useful; the GM is regetting the
day he let us design them.


Other useful low tech stuff:

	Ceramic knives (hold a *very* sharp edge almost forever, and don\'t
	show up in airport/spaceport detectors),

	portable neutrino detectors (great for locating fusion power
	sources, e.g. space planes, reactors, grav-sleds, etc).

	\'God Gambit\' transmitters: a radio that is powerful enough to rattle
	garbage can lids, fillings, and building supports across one face of
	a planet. Useful for getting low tech worlds to think that you are
	omnipotent...

Also see James Bond movies for lots of neat gadgets, and any cyberpunk
novels you can get your hands on.

>Eyephone shades with eye-cursor
	Things that eyephone shades can be used for are weapons tracking,
perhaps tied with a gyro stabelized weapons platform or gun.  How about
that as a guard dog substitute. look at your target, bink to lock the
pointer and say zap.  Robie then unloads a few hundered rounds at the
unfortunate target.
	If you do any combat you can use the shades to provide 360 degree
vision, or view other sensing spectra given your hand comp has the required
sencing equipment.  Perhaps a tricorder style of analysis and comentary fed
into your vision as you view things.
	More mundane and near future uses for such a system would provide
long distance telecomunication, remote monitoring of your situation,
provide a location service (ie maps), remote storage and retrieval of data,
providing access to a computerized expert on a range of topics.
Artificially inteligent expert systems are available now, but these should
be tightly controled by the GM.  Available topics should be very narrow,
commonly available topics, expert systems do not have the intuitive
abilities that humans have.  Current expert systems do things like diagnose
viral diseases, but it would be lost if you had a broken leg.
	Then there is always the terminator solution.  Eyephones display
realtime commentary about surroundings and were used to generate replies
that allowed the terminator to fit in with his current sittuation and
providing him a variety of options.  Swap your hand comp rom pack out and
put in a module for local street slang.  Then when the local street scum
question whether you belong on their turf, you can respond to them
eloquently with out resorting to violence.  I\'m sure you could come up with
other ideas given some thought.


>Getting into the Rat Race...
	Swiss army rodents, a new style of computer peripheral hardware.
For breaking into computers I think you would have a better method by using
remote telecomunications from your hand comp.  And a human is a better lock
pick than a machine, but as a bug or spy device it may work.

	Interesting.  I\'m working on a pair of smart pistols (sort of back
burner for the moment, while the "fun" stuff gets done) and I think I could
tie the targeting into the eyephones.

> 360 degree vision, or view other sensing spectra given your hand comp

	Interesting, but may take some convincing to get the GM to goforit.

	Many interesting ideas,thanks much... the terminator option,
idaknow.  If I can find a book on streetslang, perhaps, but that won\'t
be easy.  Maybe drop by a local linguistics dept. at a nearby college...

	Nonono... I think you missed the point.  They aren\'t designed to
be lockpicks or computer crackers.  Those options are there to increase
the range of possibilities for the Ratbots once they get inside a ship
or building.  Also, most ships have a self-contained system that is hard
to hack into from the outside.  On the other hand, a Ratbot sneaking
into a secure terminal at the heart of the ship and downloading a virus
program...  Your last comment, as a bug or spy device, is precisely on
target.  They are for spying and doing mischief (what the tiny little
hands are for :-)

	This might be fun.  I\'m thinking along the lines of programming
an image converter (from one of the journals) into my hand computer,
then filtering the data through the eyephone cameras through the
computer before displaying it to me.  
	
	The other ideas outlined are also interesting, but I think the

	Uhmm... yes, but where do you find a street slang module?
Perhaps by dropping by the local major university\'s linguistics or
anthro dept...

	Hmmm... I think you missed the point here.  The reason for the
rats to have the electronic lock picks and computer software is for
THEIR advantage when they\'re doing stuff, not so I can pull out a rat
and try to lockpick something.  My character\'s computer and electronics
skills are very high - I could probably hack most anything or pick any
electronic lock.  
 
	As far as remote telecomm, for the most part I agree with you.
Too bad the GM doesn\'t.  I can see some of his view - that the ships
computers are self-contained and you have to gain entry to the ship to
hack them.  But then again many of the players and NPCs use their hand
computers linked to their ships computers while they\'re in port.  The
idea behind the ratbot\'s interface and software is that they can sneak
in to a "secure terminal" and dump the software directly into the
computer, without having to hack past any login software or what-have-
you. 
 
	Speaking of which, what kinds of things could I do with my high
computer skill?  I\'m in dire need of some ready cash (all of my benefits
were used getting a +4 intelligence, my hand computer, and a scientist\'s
scout/courier [from _More_Clout_For_Scouts_ in an early issue of the
Dragon]) and I\'m thinking about software as a possible source.  I could
write some "standard" software and sell it, or I could try to do a
better version of the stuff on the list of ships software, or I could
try to write new and unusual programs.  Anybody have any ideas on new
programs for the ships computers, or for hand computers?

	Nice stuff, but out of the question - in this campaign there is
a massive prejudice against cybernetics or bionics - the "shoot on
sight" kind of prejudice.  Comes from having a thirty year war against
cyborgs, I suppose.  I know there is a gadget called an Implant chip or
something similar in one of the Journals of the Traveller\'s Aid Society,
which does much of what the above do, but I\'m hoping it\'s subtle enough
to pass, perhaps a bio-chip which doesn\'t show up on a medscan.  Anybody
care to type in the stats and e-mail \'em?  Would be much appreciated...

	Fun gadgets, how about ordering me a few? :-)  Nice, but
probably hard to find.  So far,  the highest TL we\'ve reached (going to
reach) is 12.  There are several TL15 or 16 worlds out there, very
neutral and self-absorbed - and powerful enough to keep it that way.
I\'m going to make a sojourn to one of them ASAP.

	Glad to hear this, as it means I\'m on the right track.  The only
question is what kind of capabilities it\'ll have.  The system I used to
generate my character didn\'t mention any "robotics" skill, and I ended
up with an Electronics-4 and Mech-2.  My computer skill is more than
enough to program them (level 6).  In response to my initial query "I
want to build some little rat robots-" the GM answered "You need
robotics skill."  to which I replied "There isn\'t any."  To which he
replied "It\'s in Citizens of the Imperium."  Fun, eh?  Well, he says I
can\'t design the robots without robotic skill.  

[I liked the open-endedness of Traveller skills, but one thing I\'ve
 always disliked about them is the fact that many skills only show up in
 later books, and that there is no easy way to work them into the
 character generation tables in earlier books.  Personally I preferred
 just using general skills instead of breaking things down like that.] 

	So I\'ve got a computer full of technical data, I\'m going to look
up the designs for various robots, find one that is close enough to suit
my purposes, and then either downscale it to largish rat size (5-6") or
use the originals if it\'s already in that range (pipe cleaner bots, for
example.) 

	Thanks for the suggestions - how about the more common
technology that is around and ready to be perverte to my nefarious ends?

Yes, please.  I would like more info on the ship rules (construction, combat,
etc.).  And if anyone else out there in traveller-land has any special or
otherwise interesting rules, how about letting us know at least what they are
concerned with so people can decide if they want to see them.  I\'d be
interested in seeing anything to do with ships and combat, or neat gadgets.

Well, on one occasion when we were facing an enemy battleship, one character
with a good computer skill and a good computer hacked into the enemy ship\'s
computer, and caused the ship to jump. No-one ever saw that ship again, partly
because it had been in near orbit round a planet when it jumped.

Electronics, some form of mechanical engineering, and computer programming
skills practically *define* robotics; you should almost get free robotics
skill points for this, or at least be allowed to use these related skills at
penalty.

This is a general comment by the way; Skills are not as narrowly focused in
reality as is implied in RPG skill sets. Many \'skills\' are inter-related,
and can be applied to other things. I like hierarchical skill sets much
better than flat ones because of this. i.e. a character with:

        Driving-2 -> GroundVehicle-4

Means that the character has a skill level of 4 when driving wheeled ground
vehicles (cars, small trucks) but has a skill of 2 in *all* other \'driving\'
related skills, i.e. small boats, small hovercraft, large trucks, etc.

Of course, the problem is that coming up with a consistent set of
hierarchical skill is, um, difficult (to say the least).

Ammonia and Iodine mixed together makes a great contact explosive. Be
careful though; it is highly volatile once it has \'gelled\', which takes
about 20 minutes. Don\'t breathe on it.

You have it wrong.   You are supposed to use the Heads up display that the 
origional poster was designing as adisplay device to be inobvious.  Options 
are provided to the user as suggestions when someone speaks to him.  The 
whole point is for this to be undetectable.

	You\'re right, you can\'t visualize it.  For one thing, in the campaign
supposedly *everyone* has handcomputers.  Kinda like a watch, or driver\'s 
liscence.  For another, the input wouldn\'t be that slow, nor the output,..

Scum: Hey, dud, where the *@#! are you from?
PC (pauses for a moment, his eyes inscrutable behind a set of heavy wrap-
    around shades)  I\'s out of that there !#$@ just round the sqorner.
Scum: #$%% ensem there, you\'re ice.  Let\'s find some $%#

	Since the PC is using a set of eyephones, and the computer is equipped 
with microphone (and even speakers & subvocal input) the Scum has no idea what
is going on.

	Sounds fun, especially since my computer skill should be high enough
to make that a breeze.  However, our GM has already ruled that ships computers
are generally not acessible from outside the ship.  Does anybody have any
suggestions, or know of any traveller sources that say otherwise?

	So far I\'ve done a few nasty things by sneaking inside the ship to
get access to the computer (with forged documents saying we were from the
starport maintenace service...)

Yeah, it\'s me again. Two weeks in that living hell that humans call Notre 
Dame, Indiana, doing the impossible for the ungrateful. Pfui!

Anyway, on various topics:

The only thing I\'d heard from the DGP staff on the real Strephon was that they
were kicking around the idea of an adventure module with three possible 
endings: one, that it\'s a clone or an impostor, two, that it\'s a Krenstein 
special (i.e. a robot), and three, that it\'s really Streffie. Anyway, the 
module would also contain a mail-in card that would let the ref vote for the 
ending he or she liked best, and the "official" history would follow the vote.
(This was mentioned at the DGP roundtable at GenCon 1988, and no word since.)

On non-Imperium Traveller: I\'ve done it twice, both times to introduce new 
players to the game\'s mechanics. The universes were unremarkable future-
histories on a limited scale, but they went over well. The players were very 
young, and found the Imperium a bit overwhelming.

On new and bizarre gear: There\'s enough material in my files for a separate 
article on the subject, so that\'ll come along later. My specialty is in hand
weapons development, but other gizmos have made themselves known....

And to Jim Cunningham: The secret is in prioritization over time. I do what\'s 
important to me at any given moment. Since I\'m between finishing up my classes 
(May 1987) and finishing up my thesis (sometime in 1990), I have more 
flexibility for my writing, gaming, and music. Hopefully, in 1990 I\'ll be able 
to get my Traveller book published, release my second album, finish my thesis, 
and get married and honeymoon in New Zealand for a couple of weeks, all 
without the need to resort to cloning or other drastic measures. I had to 
shoot my clone two years ago, when he finished taking my comprehensive Ph.D. 
exams for me and demanded time with my girlfriend as compensation.

(Realistically, though, I\'ll settle for the wedding and the Ph.D. |-> )

There are two ways to tackle this, depending on whether or not you think
the Navy (or Army, or whatever your character is from) uses robots. If it
does, then you could substitute Robotics for Electronics, the nearest
available equivalent. If it doesn\'t, tough - your character never met a
robot, and wouldn\'t know what to do with one. You might substitute it for
Computer skill instead.

Mind you, I\'d think that actually building the thing, as opposed to using
or programming it, would use Electronics anyway. After all, the world\'s
best computer programmer (Computer-10?) couldn\'t design and build even a
simple microcomputer, unless he had some Electronics skill.

So where no specific skill is available, use the nearest one to it. If
necessary, have a word with the referee during character creation, and
substitute the new skill for an old, similar one.

It claims to be MS-DOS compatible (insert favourite insult here:-). What
that means on a machine with no disc-drive isn\'t quite clear; I believe you
can copy any MS-DOS software to it via its comms. link, then run it.

[I admitted to being somewhat rusty on my astronomy hobby.  Now everyone
listen up for these corrections/additions/clarifications.
- --jamesp@dadla.wr.tek.com]

Recently, there was a posting regarding stellar information for someone
who wanted "real" star system generation information.  Some of the material
in there was not quite correct and some was wrong.  I will attempt to clear
up a few things.

First, stellar classification is done by 1) mass, 2) temperature, 3) (much
less important) composition.  The third point is usualy equivalent to 
age, but not always.  All stars go through several evolutionary stages
which are more or less the way they were described in the previous posting.

Mercury is *not* tide locked.  It was believed to be tide locked into the
sixties, and some *current* text books still list it as tide locked, although
it most certainly is not.  This is certainly an easy mistake to make given
the state of astronomical literature, but it is a mistake, none the less.

Stars in globular clusters.  Don\'t worry about it in a Traveller universe.
It is possible that a planetary system could develop and could remain
relatively stable within a globular cluster for billions of years.  It is
also very possible that the system would be torn to shreds by a star passing
nearby, it depends on the circumstances.  You don\'t need to worry about 
systems in globulars because 1) they\'re very old, which means they\'re *very*
metal poor.  Therefore, not only is civilization unlikely to develop there,
but nobody except scientists would want to go there (personally, I\'d give
up several limbs to get a close look at one.), 2) They are so far away 
(on the order of 50,000 light years) so that without a massive advance in
primary drive technology, nobody will get there.

Binary stars can be contact binaries (literally touching each other) to
very distant binaries (on the order of a couple of light years).  They
can also be anything in between.  If the stars are close enough, distant
planets can pretty much treat them as a single star (see variable stars
below, though).  If they are distant enough, a planet can treat them as
two separate stars; orbit one and ignore the other.  If the system is 
one main star with a companion orbiting in a planet-like orbit (distance
wise) foget it.  Not only are no stable orbits possible, (assuming 
both stars are massive enough to be significant) but humans and human-like
life couldn\'t survive the radical climatic changes.  Other life forms, 
however, might be able to.  The instability of the orbits is a *real*
problem, though.

Other system types?  How about a planet orbiting a variable star.  All
close (contact) binaries will be variable.  Unless you are very high
tech, or very adaptable, or really weird, you (as a species) will not
be able to survive in a variable star system like an RR Lyrae, delta
Cepei, W Virginis, omicron Ceti, U Geminorum or other "well known"
variable star type.  Good for curiosities and weird adventures, though.
Flare stars and X-ray binaries pose a special hazard to travellers.
All of these stars in the shattered imperium will be well known and 
*very* well studied.  I would also guess that with the possible exception
of Semi-regular red giants and ZZ Ceti type stars, their periods will 
be very well known, especially by Travellers.

I hope this helps.  If there are any questions, let me know.

Hi out there in Mailing List Land...

	I\'ve got a question:  The original traveller game doesn\'t
give much of a solid idea of what you can do with computer skill,
even though it has more information than most other skill descriptions.
This is because the traveller books don\'t give that much detail about
computers in the traveller universe.
 
	From what I\'ve read here,  the new traveller games have much
more detailed "task" systems.  What do they have on the Computer skill,
and on computers in the traveller universe?

	If anyone has read the series of books by Fredrick Pohl "Beyound

the sort of thing you find happening in traveler.

Hey, gang, I haven\'t forgotten my promise to submit a feature on Traveller
gear, but I\'m going to have to alter it a bit to remove some references to
gear that I\'ll be attempting to publish in the Travellers\' Digest and in 
Challenge. If it gets in, then it\'ll be official and you can read about it
yourselves, and if it doesn\'t, well, then I\'ll publish it here as a variant.

Anyway, one question: does anyone know what MegaTraveller policy is concerning 
the HFMP-15? This was the "Hand Flamer," a low-efficiency plasma pistol for 
use with battle dress, as introduced in JTAS (Issue #3, I think). The idea was 
to have a relatively low-powered sidearm for use in cramped situations, 
powered from the same fusion pack that powered the battle dress. It seemed 
like a good idea, and is certainly plausible in technological terms (plasma 
devices on its scale exist today, for use in welding heat-resistant metals and 
so on), but it never seemed to catch on. Most of the weapons that were 
introduced in the JTAS, like the autoshotgun, tranq rounds, and the ARL, have
been incorporated into the official rules, but there\'s no mention of the 
HFMP-15. Pity, too; it was a nifty little gun. Did they leave it out to try to 
conserve game balance? That seems silly since it\'s not concealable unless you 
remove the fusion pack |-> . 

And by the way, what exactly are those fusion packs, anyway? Are they really 
small fusion reactors? If so, then how are the "minimum reactor size per Tech
Level" figures reconciled with them?

Just curious....

I\'ve got an archive server running on my machine, and you can use it to 
get back postings from the traveller mailing list.  I\'ve got most of the 
postings since 426.  (About 5% of the postings never get to me, so I do 
not have those.)  In general, a posting will put in the archive within 
three working days of arrival here.  An archive server is a mail command 
program.  You send it an email request, and it sends you email back with 
your answer.  

The archive server can be reached by sending email to 
archive-server@joshua.atherton.com.  The human manager of the archive can 
be reached at archive-manager@atherton.com, or joshua@atherton.com in an 
emergency.  The body of the email message can contain one or more commands:

The server has four commands:
    help			Send a general help message.
    index [<category>]		Send an index for the category.
    send <category> <file(s)> 	Send one or more files from the category.
    path <return-path>		Route reply to this address.

Currently, there are five categories of files:
    traveller  Back articles from the traveller mailing list, starting at 426.
    cyberrpg   Back articles from the CyberRPG mailing list.
    design     Back articles from the Game Designer\'s mailing list. (dead?)
    programs   Programs for role playing games.
    background Useful background information for SFRPGs.
    other      Other interesting files.

Sample command lines to send:
    index traveller              Sends an index of traveller articles.
    path joshua@atherton.com     Server will reply to this address.
    send programs rnd-names      Sends a random name generating program.
    send traveller tm426 tm427   Sends back articles from the traveller list.
    index                        Sends "top level" index

The server\'s UUCP address is {decwrl|hpda|sun}!athertn!archive-server.

Note the confusing thing about the email addresses:  our domain name is

The big question in getting up my archive server was "how are people going
to find the articles they want?"  If you know the number of the article 
you want, it\'s easy, just ask for it, "send traveller tm534", also if you
know the author or subject, you can look for it in the index, which you 
can get with "index traveller".  

Are there other indexes or references that you want in order to find the 
articles you want?  If so, please tell me about them, so I can look into
adding them.  Thanks.

Forget all your smart handguns, forget eye-piece gunsights! I\'ve got the
ultimate weapon. :-)

It depends on fibre-optic cable capable of carrying a laser pulse of
laser-rifle power.

In your backpack, you have the power unit and the laser itself. The laser
should be switchable between either of two power settings.  The low power
setting produces a continuous low power beam, about the same power as a small
targetting laser. The high power setting produces a pulse similar to the one
from a laser rifle (or for a lighter backpack, a laser carbine).

In your hand, you have a small pistol. It has a two-stage trigger. It is
connected to the backpack by a cable containing a fibre-optic line and an
electronic control line. When you pull the trigger to its first stage, the
laser is triggered on its low power, continuous mode, and you have a
targetting laser which you can wave around and point at things. When it\'s
pointing at something interesting, like the bad guy\'s head, you pull the
trigger the rest of the way. This switches the laser to its full power pulse
mode, and a laser rifle bolt goes right where your targetting beam was just
a moment ago.

If you can\'t have a dual power laser, have two lasers linked to the same
fibre-optic cable; one low power, the other straight from an ordinary rifle.
This method is probably better in that the targetting laser can be IR, so
you aren\'t lighting yourself up at the same time. You, of course, are wearing
goggles which allow you to see where the target beam is hitting.

Assuming it works, how do you implement this in a game? What die roll do you
need to hit, assuming you can take an aimed shot? The way I see it, it seems
to be impossible to miss.

	I\'ll point that out to him... maybe I can dig up a robotics or

	Yuh, I understand... several game systems seem to be working towards
this, GURPS with their default skills, the new Shadowrun with their skill
web (you start at one node of the web which represents a skill; each node
further away is a modifier to attempt that related skill.  Interesting idea.)
Traveller (old traveller, at least) seemed to be trying a simpler method to
attain this - simply broadly defined skills instead of hyperspecialization.
This would also make sense for "adventurer" types, since if they were hyper
specialized they\'d have some great job with a corporation and stay at home.

	Unfortunately, all of that changed as new books were introduced with
more skills.  It wouldn\'t be half so infuriating if the new books "back-dated"
the old books, so that all characters could get all skills.  
 
	One other problem with old traveller was lack of task definition. From
what I\'ve seen here, the new traveller rules have very specific task definition
perhaps TOO specific :-)

	Yeah, that\'s a fun set of chemicals.  I read about that one in
Heinlein\'s _Farnham\'s_Freehold_.  Easily obtainable too...

	Latest two ideas:  Take an ACR, hook up a grav module and hand 
computer (to the battlefield sight) and you\'ve got a floating programmed
gun emplacement!  Other idea: remote control garrote, for controlling 
those rowdy prisoners....

The ~10 year old varient TRAVELER campaigns that Bill Ricker mentioned are
chronicled in my magagine THE WILD HUNT.  The rules have not been published
anywhere to my knowledge (GDW copyrights could be a problem) but might be
procurable from Paul Gazis, one of TWH\'s contributors in #148. They were
originally published in TWH #60-68 (roughly) some years back.  These back
issues are theoretically available but are rather deeply buried in my
basement.  However, many campaign writeups and comments do appear at this
time.

The Wild Hunt is published 9 times a year (Jan-May, July, Sep-Nov). The
148th issue was just mailed.  It costs $3 per issue + postage ($0.90 for
book rate, $2.40 for 1st class) for typically about 100+ pages of photocopied
zines with line art, etc. Send me a check to open an account if interested.

It\'s probably very accurate but comparatively slow.  It\'d be great
sniper/assassin weapon, but I\'d be inclined to severely restrict its
snap shot potential and/or give the other side a chance to notice that
someone is painting cute little red spots on them.

Hi gang! This one\'s for gearheads only, and it\'s kind of long, so bear with 
me, okay? You can always delete it if you get bored! |->

On the subject of fun gear for tech-heads, the various Traveller games I\'ve 
run over the years have had more than their share of bizarre gadgets and odd 
weapons. It\'s become a tradition for players to fill out their characters and 
give them depth, not only by developing philosophies, religions, personal 
habits and beliefs, and so on, but also by designing and building or having 
built special items for combat and technical use. These included various odd 
technical gizmos, customized weapons, and a class of items that became ongoing
traditions in my campaigns and which may get added to the official rules if I
can get anyone at GDW or DGP to listen to me, so they\'ll have to wait a while.

It\'s amazing to see and hear the detail to which people will go to create 
weird and dangerous items to give them an edge over their foes. One of the 
most popular tricks I used was to allow characters weapons and gear that were
customized to the point of ridiculousness, based on the following set of
restrictions: 

1. Money, construction skill, and tech level and law level of the world and 
factory or weaponsmith\'s shop where the device was built would all control and 
limit the capabilities of the final device. 

2. In the case of weapons, the weapon design would be somewhat similar to an
existing weapon in the rules lists, with certain differences suggested by the
player and allowed by the ref. The weapon would either be: 

	a. Essentially identical to an existing weapon in terms of rules (i.e. 
	   the same range limitations, effectiveness against armor, etc.), but 
	   somehow unique in its operation (thus lending "flavor" to campaigns
	   where it was used), and/or

	b. A modification of an existing design, that would introduce certain
	   advantages to the user in exchange for disadvantages elsewhere. 
	   These would show up as adjustments to the rules and noted in the
	   description of the weapon.

3. The player and ref would agree on all of the device\'s capabilities and 
limitations to preserve game balance, and the ref would be the final authority 
in cases where it was felt that the devices was somehow being abused.

With these basic rules in mind, my players and I had a field day! Over the 
past eleven years, I\'ve ran people with all kinds of strange stuff.

AN EXAMPLE: THE HUNTER
Consider one fellow who was running a bounty hunter in one of my more Space 
Opera-ish campaigns: he wanted a weapon that would give him a certain 
signature, one that was instantly recognizable to anyone who saw it, so that 
criminals would know that he was nearby and tremble (!). What we decided upon 
was to give him a weapon similar to the guns used in the film Logan\'s Run (NOT 
the design in the book; that was implemented elsewhere, for other reasons). 
These guns were the epitome of the evil, uncaring death that the bounty hunter 
carried with him: they spat green flame in four tongues surrounding the 
barrel, and the victim erupted in green fire and died. What did that become in 
terms of Traveller rules? Let\'s see:

1. First, the weapon\'s mode of operation had to be agreed upon. It was decided 
that the device was a Gauss pistol, firing incendiary rounds that ignited 
while still in the gun so as to be fully lit before impact (hence the flame 
vents). Thus it was limited to worlds with TL 13 or greater, Law level below 1 
(since the rounds were explosive) OR Law above 11 (then the gun would be in 
the hands of the Thought Police or some such), and oppressive or dangerous 
governments. I chose a suitable world, and told him that\'s where the gun was 
made. It\'s his only source of spare parts, ammo, and power packs, so he gets 
back there often or arranges for shipments to other worlds at a high cost.
If he runs low, getting to a supply source as his ammo supply dwindles becomes 
an adventure in and of itself! |->

2. The gun, as mentioned above, would come under option "a", as it was 
essentially an unusual design of Gauss pistol, with few, if any, major changes 
in terms of effects in the rules. The primary advantage, as mentioned, was 
psychological.

3. We agreed to run the weapon exactly as a Gauss pistol under the rules as 
given in TRAVELLER, and no questions or quibbles were ever raised. (I secretly 
noted the dangers inherent in shooting such a gun in areas full of flammable 
vapors, but he seemed to understand the risks and never did anything stupid.)

The end result: a nifty, impressive weapon, that didn\'t mess up game balance, 
but gave his character depth and recognition, both to NPCs and to his fellow 
players:

"The thug stands over you, one foot on your gun wrist and the muzzle of his 
pistol pointing at your face. He grins as he squeezes the trigger. Suddenly, 
he looks up at the sound of a tiny footstep from behind you, and screams, "NO! 
PLEASE!" There is an odd coughing noise, a burst of green fire, and he 
collapses in agony, writhing on the concrete. A figure in black steps out of 
the shadows; the Hunter has come through again."

Get the idea?

SOME MORE EXAMPLES: THE WEAPONS OF NEAR MISS
Near Miss, the characters of my GenCon adventures and the associated fiction 
stories, have been adventuring for decades, and rely on their weapons for 
their survival. Over the years, they\'ve fine-tuned their own special needs, 
for weapons that cover all of the bases properly. Some of them were satisfied 
with traditional designs or minor alterations, while others had very specific 
needs. So:

CAPTAIN CRISIS was a Navy fighter pilot. He knew that he could be downed in 
hostile territory at any time, so he needed a weapon that would let him 
survive and defend himself over a wide range of situations (mostly military) 
yet be portable and easy to handle. The result was the Camberwell GP114, 
nicknamed the "Hammerhead," a special Gauss Pistol developed for fighter 
pilots. It was heavier and somewhat bulkier than normal Gauss pistols, but had 
a gyro unit and a laser targeting sight installed. RULES: treat as Gauss 
Pistol, but use "Scope," "Gyro," or "Scope+Gyro" task difficulties depending 
on what the firer chooses to use. Note that the firer must be braced and 
non-moving to use Gyro, and that Scope changes the weapon\'s signature to 
Medium (it\'s a low-efficiency laser, with lots of lens scatter) and may not be 
usable for snap fire (ref\'s discretion).

WINDY was a Scout Explorer. Her primary concerns were self-defense, hunting, 
and survival, and she couldn\'t be bothered to carry both a rifle and a pistol 
for field research. The Scout Exploration office issues, for such operatives, 
the Stenhauser MVACW, a weapon that provides excellent hunting and defense 
capability in a portable package. It\'s essentially a 9mm ACR with a very short
barrel and no shoulder stock, the bullpup-style magazine offset slightly to
allow the weapon to be held pistol-fashion. Long barrel and full stock can be
attached if desired. RULES: The Stenhauser, when fully set up with barrel,
scope, gyro and stock, is treated like any other ACR. However, the
barrel/stock unit (which is a one-piece device on a frame, not two separate
items) also contains the scope mount and the gyrostabilizer; when the action
and grip are detached from this, the gun uses the Handgun difficulty tables,
with no Scope or Gyro enhancements. Its maximum range is Medium due to the
short barrel, and damage and penetration are as normal for the type of ACR
ammo in use. Autofire is treated as for any other handgun with autofire
capability. (Use of both hands in controlling the weapon is advisable.)

COUNTDOWN specializes in explosives applications and demolitions. This makes 
the Snub Pistol (revolver style) and ARL essentially perfect for her uses, but 
there\'s an occasional need for something heavier. So she found an ARL with an 
underbarrel RAM grenade launcher. RULES: The RAM GL is a typical 3-shot TL 13
model, and the ARL runs by the same set of rules as always, but weight and 
encumbrance are slightly higher. The weapon may also be restricted at lower 
Law Levels than would be normal for an ARL.

MOTORMUTT doesn\'t fight for a living, and he never has. The less he uses 
weapons, the happier he is, so he limits himself to one single device that\'s 
there when he needs it and able to handle just about any situation in which he 
finds himself: a Stinger, essentially a TL 14 version of the Body Pistol using 
Gauss technology. Tiny, silent, and deadly. RULES: Treat as Gauss Pistol, but 
limit range to Medium, allow no autofire, and limit number of shots to five. 
In exchange, allow greater concealability and improved DMs for snap fire. 
Magazines and power packs are custom designs, and may be difficult to replace.
The weapon is not designed to avoid metal detectors.

DOCSHOCK specialized in psychoacoustic response science before SuSAG put him 
to work as a Field Operations Specialist (read, industrial spy). His research 
into nonlethal means of subdual led him to aid in the development of the 
Marovcenko Sonic Stunner. RULES: The MSS is built as a modular plug-in 
replacement for the flash tube of a TL 13 Laser Carbine, and can be converted 
back to use as a Laser in four rounds if the extra tube is handy. As a sonic 
weapon, it operates under the Neural Rifle rules, with no effectiveness in 
vacuum or Very Thin atmospheres and increased likelihood of damaging Mishaps.
Its signature is High, not due to flash but to operating noise (a piercing
shriek that ranges from skin-crawling behind the cone of effect to eardrum- 
shattering within it). Appicable skill is Lasers; he also carries an Integral 
Laser Pistol.

LIGHTS wasn\'t supposed to be a fighter for a living, but her Captain insisted 
on her at least learning to handle some weapon for ship defense, since Pursers 
must often be pressed into service for antihijacking work. So she chose the 
Shotgun, so as not to miss too often. The problem then became obtaining a 
suitable sidearm: her solution was to buy a second shotgun and cut it down.
RULES: Range limited to Long, difficulty as Pistol, no rapid fire, failure 
to stand and brace increases tasks by one level of difficulty, although a 
two-handed grip suffices for "bracing" in most cases; number of shots limited 
to five, and weapon falls under Handguns rather than Shotguns for Law Level 
limitations. No detachable magazine; must be reloaded by hand, one shot per 
combat round.

HUG was a warrior, plain and simple. He chose his weapons well, and used 
others only when neccessary. These days, his LAG and Snub AutoPistols are 
built by human gunsmiths to utilize easily available human-made spare parts, 
but are designed for Aslan hands and ergonomics: the Snub Pistols, especially, 
are strange-looking, as it is Aslan custom to mount the barrel UNDER the grip 
for better recoil control! (If you don\'t believe this, look in the annals of 
the NRA: A Soviet team was barred from rapid-fire pistol competition a number 
of years ago, because their "upside-down" guns gave them a massive advantage 
over the Americans and Europeans.) RULES: Increase repair tasks by one level 
for all devices; increase all attempts by humans to use weapons by one level 
of difficulty. No other changes, except for an optional Scope modifier for all 
weapons (either optical, as for LAG, or a laser pointer, for Snubbies.)
[Ref\'s note: this last bit is still being worked on, as there\'s never been a 
definitive statement on the ergonomics of Aslan tools and weapons as there has 
been for most of the other races (it\'s known that Vargr hands work well with 
the ovoid-cylindrical handles given to most human tools, and that Hivers
prefer to handle spheres of various sizes with their tentacles, for example).
This design may change after DGP gets through with the Aslan in their next few
issues; another possibility is a gun with two barrels, one over the grip and
one under it...the only worthwhile idea in the entire movie THE BLACK HOLE.] 

TINKER can\'t be bothered with weapons at all; she\'s a technician. But there\'s 
no law against modifying a Laser Welder for pulsed operation, is there? 
RULES: On Pulse setting, treat as Laser rifle, no real modifications. 
[A possible change to this character will replace the Laser with a device
that\'s more efficient both as a tool and as a weapon: a Powercutter, which
utilizes a plasma beam rather than laser light. A strong disadvantage to this
design, which has yet to be addressed adequately anywhere in the TRAVELLER
rules, is the weapon\'s signature: "High" is too weak a word. Plasma beams
(I\'ve worked with a couple) are unbelievably bright; it\'s like staring into
the Sun! You can\'t get anywhere near them without going blind, unless your
eyes are heavily protected. And the waste heat in the vicinity is frightening;
I can\'t imagine using one of these without Battle Dress on.] 

Anyway, I\'ve gotten amazingly long-winded here, and I\'m sorry; the Near Miss 
gang are usually good models for anything you\'ll find in my campaign, and if 
nothing else you can consider the above a partial introduction to them. |->
I hope that these guidelines prove worthwhile for you in keeping your technoid 
players under control, and that your own campaigns can now bristle with 
bizarre techno-rubble without coming completely apart.

Have fun,

I had always assumed that laser weapons _did_ have a targeting beam of
lower power (unless specifically stated otherwise), that could be used
exactly as described.  I suppose that one might want to have a switch that
would disable the targeting laser, for surprise.  I didn\'t consider the
goggles for seeing the beam - I was assuming something like the Terminator
used in the movie of the same name.  The laser carbine and rifle have
tremendous hit probabilities already, right?

I would assume that the Hit would be automattic, but you would still have
to roll for aquisition. So I would run the first shot as normal just calling 
the to hit roll an aquisition roll. To reaquire, you may have to develop 
a system, like maybe the normal to hit +2 making it easier to reaquire the 
target. This however would be conditional to how much damage and did the
target after getting fried, decide that it is far better to hide than
get ones brains fried just for fun. 

Does this make sense?

Adrian:

It\'s a nifty idea, but there\'s only one problem: the fiber-optic cable itself.
I\'m primarily involved with quantum optics on the theoretical level, and my
practical lab experience with lasers isn\'t as much as what I have with, say, 
magnetic steering and bottling, but I can guarantee this: the idea will only 
work (and this is a pretty lame caveat, I admit) if the next seven or eight 
Tech Levels beyond ours have some amazing breakthroughs in fiber-optic 
technology. Here\'s my reasoning:

For the novices, fiber optics works by designing a material that refocusses 
divergent light energy "gently" back onto its original path. What this means 
is that the light beam arrives at its destination in essentially the same form 
as it left its source, and there is very little loss along the way (which is 
why US Sprint is making such a big hooha about using them). The problem is 
that there\'s no such thing as a "loss-free" cable; if there\'s any 
quantum-level interaction between lased photons and the atoms of the cable, 
and there HAS to be for the cable to operate at all, there will be an energy 
loss in the form of waste heat. Now, for most applications, such as 
telecommunications etc., this loss will be minimal, perhaps even immeasurable. 
But when we start talking about the levels of power communicated by a good- 
sized battlefield laser, things become more complicated. 

At this point, we have to consider the problem of laser weapons themselves. 
They\'re the most dangerous non-nuclear weapons in the Traveller arsenal, and 
everyone likes to have one around, but how do they really work? It\'s 
impractical to merely shoot a hole through someone: the high heat causes 
instant cauterization of the wound, and if vital organs are missed the victim 
may not even feel much pain. The concept behind the laser\'s effectiveness 
comes in heat transfer and tissue trauma: the water in human cell tissue is 
enormously efficient at absorbing and dissipating heat energy from radiative 
input on the visible wavelengths, so when a human body stops a laser pulse, a
chunk of flesh about the size of a golf ball at the point of contact instantly
flash-heats into steam, rupturing cell walls, causing potentially fatal organ
hyperthermia, and exploding outward in a sudden burst that may take a great
deal of unheated flesh with it. The results are properly graphic for fans of
special effects  a la George Romero: a loud explosion and a burst of blood and
pink steam, with an action-reaction effect (since the exploding flesh acts
against the human body as a reaction mass) that can hurl the victim backward
as nicely as a high-velocity lead slug. 

Lovely to look at, but how does this relate to fiber optics? Simple: If that 
much energy is being output in a single impulse (to overload the body water\'s 
ability to conduct heat away from the impact point swiftly enough to avoid a 
steam-burst) down a fiber-optic cable, the cable will almost certainly melt 
from the waste heat. The tradeoff between flexibility and sturdiness under 
handling is a tricky one in fiber optics, and to the best of my knowledge no 
one has yet tried to add extreme heat-impulse resistance into the equation. If 
you shrug and say, "Well, at TL15 there\'ll be fibers that can handle it," then 
your problem\'s solved. Or rather, it\'s just beginning, because a proliferation 
of devices like this could make life difficult for both players and refs.

There are those who say that at high TL, personal lasers will be UV, X-ray, or 
even gamma-ray devices. This is bull: unless you\'re trying to kill a guy with 
radiation, these weapons are far more effective on inert metal objects than 
they are on humans. The problem, again, is the radiative-heat absorption 
properties of water. Water is dynamite at absorbing heat (hence cell damage) 
from visible light, but is transparent at shorter wavelengths. So a shortwave 
laser would pass through a human, causing severe radiation sickness but no 
immediate fatal trauma. (And fiber-optic cables can\'t work on UV or Xrays;
their wavelengths are on the subatomic level, so atomic structures can no 
longer bend or shape them. That\'s what makes Xray telescopes so difficult to 
design.) The Xray laser being worked on by the DOD these days, remember, is 
for shooting down missiles: metal have very different absorption properties 
than people, and more energy output per photon is possible with shorter 
wavelengths.

Anyway, those are my feelings on the subject. I\'d get a bit twitchy on the 
idea of letting a box like this into my game; I had a similar design in an old 
campaign, rigged to a pointer glove rather than a pistol for aiming, and the 
people who were able to get them wreaked havoc.

Let me know what you decide to do.

One of you has asked if you can tell/invite a Traveller friend of/to the
TML lunch who isn\'t on the list.  This is definitely generally okay, as
far as I am concerned.  Even people who aren\'t interested in Traveller
are welcome, as long as they can stand sitting next to people who are.
Don\'t invite anybody who might make lunch unappetizing, though (I
suppose that means that all the K\'kree will have to stay home,
*pee-yew*).

I\'m not planning any special program for lunch, just an informal
gathering and meeting.

Adrian Hurt recently mentioned using laser target designation for 
laser pistols.

I have always allowed this in my campaign.  I even let characters use
these things in the fog (and try to figure out why they are so quickly
spotted) and underwater (and wonder why there are steam explosions...).

Laser target designation works its best with beam weapons; there is no
ballistic drop.  (I know, I\'m assuming your on a planet.)  The earlier
postings alluded to sophisticated software that would automatically
calculate "drop" and "windage" and adjust the electronic sights of your
assault rifle.  Of course the latter costs a LOT more.

- ----
Now, how about the space-borne equivalent: software that calculates
the shifting of the target and refraction (and focusing) of the beam
caused by, say, a gravity lens and feeds this information to the
targeting computer?

Imagine tryng to find a ship that fired at an oblique angle and 
literally bent the beam around a dense body to hit you.

  Hello all.

  This is actually in regards to the weapons debate, though I do have a
question for the list historian if he gets that far.

  In one of my previous games, we had a true point and shoot death beam in the
game.  We were all equiped to TL 17 or 18 before the DM knew what that meant. 
He gave the entire merry band "power gloves."  As the name implies, you pointed
an appropriate digit at the offending being, vehicle, or starship that annoyed
you, and an appropriate blast of power removed it from the game.

  While the actual implementation was kinda lame (I can see all of the pocket
computers translating furiously), the idea was handy.  We used a target system
where the thing to be vaporized was telepathicly implanted in the firer\'s mind,
along with a BIG crosshair.  This gave a major plus on any aimed shot
(Essentialy adding about 20% to your chances to penetrate armor, more if you
had any skill) PLUS making any future shots occur at about a ten percent boost. 
It was kind of fun in that it was both concealable and VERY nasty.  Applying
the idea to the proposed laser flashlight/ sword of Damocles, I would boost the
hit chance by a great deal on the first shot, possibly also upping the
penetration due to precision effects.  Later shots may get an advantage, but
the bad guy might decide to get the foo out of the way.

  For another view on this, see David Gerrold\'s creation in the Chtorr series. 
In traveller terms, it would be an upscaled Gauss rifle, perhaps due to law
level restrictions on portable energy weapons, that had full electronic scope
sights and easier precision targetting.  In essence, the rifle sent out a guide
beam that the helmet picked up.  The frequency shifted by a nasty random series
set by some switches in both the gun and the helmet, thuis allowing the fierer
to see instantly where his or her shots were going, while only lighting up the
gun to standard sensors for millisecond flashes.  Still worse than no active
systems at all, and easy to defeat with enough sensing gear and computer power,
but pretty effective against those facing it.

  Metlay: (first name not currently at hand, sorry) What information exists
about Sternmetal Horizons.  In my game, they seem kind of like a bloodthirsty
K-Mart.  Thier equipment is very good for the tech level behind where one is,
thier training is laughable, but thier people are very well trained and
effective.  Almost like thier legal staff.

  Thanks.

ps I am still working on a more sensible equipment list by tech level and
function, indexed by Per Capita planetary product, etc, but I have not had the
time.  My playing group has gotten tired of lasers and wants to get back to
midieval era gaming.  Sigh.

Bennett, don\'t read this-- it concerns the adventure you will be
going through shortly thanks.

Hi. Any ideas about the length of time involved in going from a
ship with only its power plant running for essential services
(lights, some computer functions, etc.) to a launch in a real hurry?
Specifically, the end of Legend of the Sky Raiders adventure, which
I shall be running for the third time (its fun). The idea is that the
characters take the ship by force while it`s sitting at the landing
sight and wish to leave as soon as possible. In addition, the pilot
in question is probably not familiar with the far trader and is certainly
not familiar with the current panel configurations as customized by
the ship\'s normal pilot. Thoughts?

Here are some fighter designs I\'ve used a couple times in my campaign:

Solomani FM-44D "Phantom" space control fighter

Hull: 	18/45, Disp=20, Config=6AF, Armor=40G,

		EMSJammer=FarOrbit, EMMask, PassEngScan=Rout,
		ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout
Off:	Missile = x03, Magazine=24 Btty/Rds 
			Batt    1

Accom:	Crew=1 (operator=1), Seats=roomyx1, Bunks=1
Other:	Fuel=133,911 liters, Scoops, ObjSize=small,
		EmLevel=NONE
Notes: This is the "stealth" model of the popular Solomani
FM-44 fighter.  It is commonly deployed in system defense
squadrons or "intruder" squadrons designed to harrass enemy
shipping.

I used this little guy once in an adventure (my campaign is set in the
Spinward Marches) in the hands of a bunch of former Rachelites that SolSec
had sold them to.  They operated off a converted freighter (which I\'ll 
upload if I can find the file anywhere) and hid in asteroid belts, near
gas giants, and in major shipping lanes with their systems powered most of
the way down and their EM maskers (read: cloaking devices) on.  When a juicy
target passed their way they\'d surface, jam its transmissions and order it
to surrender.  Took the PC\'s quite a while to solve the mystery of the
mysteriously disappearing freighters.  I figured that with everything shut
off except the passive scanners, the life support systems, and the EM masker,
a dedicated (read: fanatical) pilot can stay on station just drifting for
over three months.  Hence the 100-day drift endurance.  I rationalized this
design by saying that the Solomani use this class for long-term patrol duties
(suddenly surfacing in case of intruders) and for commerce raiding as above.
Hence the reason to put a bunk on a 20-ton fighter...

Solomani FM-44E "Phantom" space control fighter
CraftID: Missile fighter, Type FM, TL 14, MCr 33.845
Hull: 	18/45, Disp=20, Config=6AF, Armor=40G, 
		Unloaded=619.61 tons, Loaded=634.1 tons

Accom:	Crew=1 (operator=1), Seats=roomyx1, Bunks=1
Other:	Fuel=137,911 liters, Scoops, ObjSize=small,
		EmLevel=Strong
Notes: This is the standard-issue navy model of the FM-44.

Nifty tricks like EM masking aren\'t really necessary in a straight up-and-down
fight, so I figured the Solomani would need a more conventional version better
optimized for ship-to-ship combat than the D model (which is more like a mini
spacegoing submarine).  Anyway, I don\'t know if either of these designs will
be of use to anyone, but I thought I\'d share them just in case and to increase
the list\'s inventory of ship designs.

Consider the amount of time it takes to get your average airliner off the
ground, starting with everything off. The time is probably on the order of
an hour or so, more if you are unfamiliar with the ship.

A starship is still a very complicated piece of equiptment, and takes a long
time to start up. When your average jump takes 3 weeks, nobody really cares
that it takes a couple of hours to launch...

Scott:

No first name here. Just "Metlay." But thanx for the thought....

As for Sternmetal, they have a rather poor reputation in the GDW universe,
perhaps unfairly. Since the very first adventures, where the whole concept
of the megacorporations was still in its infancy and the GDW folx needed to
create a "big faceless corporate bad guy" entity, Sternmetal has been the 
butt of more than its share of villain roles, and incompetent ones at that.
This is sad, because there\'s no way they could have grown to the level of power
that they currently enjoy if they were always as incompetent as they\'ve been 
made out to be. If you\'d like, I can delve into my back issues of JTAS and my
old books and dig up some details about them; they\'re not really a merchan-
dising firm, but specialize instead in raw materials recovery and processing.
(This contributes to their bad reputation, as they have a tendency to leave
planets in unpleasantly befouled states.) If you want a K-mart for Average
Stellar Tech items (but one which is by NO means incompetent), I\'d suggest
Ling-Standard Products.

Any other questions?

Two possibilities: the ship either already has its fusion plant online or it
doesn\'t.  Most ships with fusion plants leave them running if they park for
less than about a week or so (I haven\'t seen the adventure you\'re running, so
I don\'t know what circumstances this A2 is in) because it takes so long to 
bring the power plant up from a cold start.  In any event, the UTP for what
they\'re trying to do looks like this:

    To power up a parked starship and ready it for flight:
    Routine, Pilot, Dex, 30 sec (assuming warm start, 5 min otherwise)

If you\'re still using the old rules (the new ones are well worth it!), the pilot
needs to roll a 7+ to start the plant.  DMs: +Pilot skill, +1 if Dex 5+ or +2
if Dex 10+.  It will take 3d6x30 sec (an average of about 5 minutes) to start
if successful (or 3d6x5 min for an average of 50 (!) minutes if the A2 is 
powered all the way down).  MegaTraveller gives rules for unfamiliar technology
but since I don\'t know what background your pilot has I\'d simply suggest about
a -2 DM or so heaped on top of this.  If he fails the roll, he\'ll have to take
another time increment and do it again.

Oh, and also: I\'m assuming that since your PC\'s are presumably in a rush, they
will skip the usual safety checks and such.  In which case, when they start the
ship, you should make a roll along with them.  If you both succeed, everything
is fine but if they succeed and you fail, you should implement a "warning light"
event about halfway to orbit (i.e. a plant malfunction, fuel leak, or the like)
that will require a harder, fateful task to avoid a major mishap.

Finally, if things get hot and your PC\'s need to get out of there in a hurry,
they can try to rush things a bit.  Double the DM\'s applied to the startup roll
but instead of a 7+ they now need to roll an 11+.  And so do you.... :-)

Oh, and I almost forgot: if anybody has Engineering skill, it can be used as a
DM as well.

With all of the recent interest in the star system generation
programs, I would like to get the star system discussion group
going again. I remember (way back when :-) that James Perkins
and Fred Schiff were discussing the developement of their
program to generate sectors and subsectors with PostScript
output on hex paper. 

Our main topics of discussion would be:

     - What referees and players would like to see in a (generic)
       sector/subsector/planet generation program,
     - The design of these programs, and whether they should be one
       program or several programs in one system,
     - The necessary data needed to keep consistency between
       each generation system,
     - Expansion of any system generation program in scope/scale
       (eg. to include planetary maps of generated worlds, maybe
       down to the \'city\' level).
     - Modification of James\' (with his permission) and the existing
       \'real\' system generation programs to incorporate new functions,
       capabilities, and data items.

We will add other topics as soon as they are mentioned. Please note
that the \'expansion\' item above is *very* ambitious with the amount
of time available (I assume that most readers have jobs and/or
school?) to use? 

We are looking for programmers, physics/astrophysics/astronomy
experts, biologist, SoRag agents, and anyone else who is
interested and has ideas about system generation (alright, even
if you don\'t have ideas on system generation we could use you).

This will be a sub-discussion group with myself as moderator, and
I\'ll post digests (just like the Trade & Commerce group) of the
discussion to the rest of the traveller mailing list. So if you\'re
interested, send me email and I\'ll add you to my personal alias
list (yes, that means that I\'ll have to forward all messages
back to the subgroup by hand).

I look forward to hearing from you.

     In The Eight Worlds (my Traveller-like game), a starship can be in 
any one of six states of readiness.  The nature, consequences, and
transition times between these states are:

     DOWN- Cold, lifeless, inert, and covered with dust:
     "Well, she flew pretty good ten years ago, but she\'s been sitting 
in the shed since then."

     COLD- On battery power and ready for opperational use.  
     "We rented a \'dozer an\' pushed \'er out to the pad.  \'Arry filled the 
air tanks an put new filters in the lifesystem.  Got a bit covered with 
sludge an \'e\'s not to \'appy bout that let me tell ya.  Arnie poked \'round
around Engineering an\' says that looks pretty good.  \'Arold replaced some
cracked boards in the avionics suite.  Sheila put new seat covers on all
all the crash couches.  We put \'er on battery power and nothing broke so 
I guess she\'s OK.  The whole job took about three weeks where\'s our cash?"

     RESERVE- Fusors up, drives ready, ship pre-flighted and on internal 
power.  Reserve consumes a detectible but negligable amount of fuel and
resources.  Reserve status also requires a small maintenance crew, 
whisically refered to as the \'anchor watch\'.
     "Right boys, this is an old ship, no telling what we\'ll find, let\'s
tear this thing apart ourselves.  
     "Johnathan!"
     "Aye Cap\'n?"
     "Go through the ENTIRE Engineering checklist before you pump down 
the fusors and drives, and make sure the power conditioning equipment 
downstream of the convertors is clean.  I don\'t trust this Arnie person 
one bit.  Give me a call before you warm and flash the fusors so we can 
co-ordinate things up on the bridge.
     " Ensign Viggens!"
     "Yes sir!"
     "Take a look at the lifesystem and see if this \'Arry fellow filled 
the tanks with oxygen.  And check to make sure he didn\'t mount the filters 
in the solid waste unit in backwards.  Remember what happened last time.
     "B\'son Dgai!"
     "Yes Captain?"
     "Reboot the bridge hardware WITH the diagnostics option which this 
\'Arold fellow so conveniently forgot and check the antenna feed lines on 
the fire radar.  I\'ll bet those fools used solder!
     "Ensign Peters!"
     [Sultry voice] "Sir?"
     "These crash couch covers are nylon, they\'ll burn like candles.  
I want \'em replaced by the time we\'re on Low Standby.
     [Outraged sultry voice] "Sir!  Replacing them will take a week!"
     "Don\'t worry, we\'ve got the time."
     o[Sultry voice] "Sir, may I ask a question?"
     "Yes Ensign."
     [Sultry voice] "How come the women always get the boring jobs?"
     "Ensign Peters, Navy Regulations are not to be questioned."

     LOW STANDBY- Engineering systems on line at low power, ship ready to 
lift after drives and fusors have been warmed up and pre-takeoff checklist 
has been completed.  Low Standy consumes moderate amounts of fuel (about 
1% what is used in normal opperations) to run the fusor and to circulate 
through the various cooling systems.
     "Bridge, Engineering, Johnathan here, ready to flash the fusors."
     "Alert, this is the Bridge, all crew to damage control stations and
acknowledge."
     [jumble of acknowledgements]
     "B\'son, your board?"
     "Green board Captain."
     "Engineering, Bridge, go ahead with the fusors."
     "Aye Cap\'n."
     CLOOOOOOONK!
     "Fusors up, engaging convertors."
     PNINNNG!
     "Convertors up, 101% nominal, batteries on charge, applying power to 
drive coils."
     TOOKA TOOKA TOOKA!
     "Fusors, convertors, and drives are at Low Standby Cap\'n, everything
looks nominal."
     "Good work Master Johnathan.
     "Alert, Crew, secure from damage control stations.  Begin pre-takeoff
checklist, I want this ship off the ground in an hour.
     "Ensign Peters, where are those new seat covers!"
     [Hurt sultry voice] "They should have been delivered by now Captain.
Oh, look I see the truck arriving now.  Permission to leave the bridge?"
     "Granted."

     STANDBY- Ready for takeoff.  Even though the drives are not running
(in fact, in the Eight Worlds, fusion drives can not be used if the 
external atmospheric density is greater than 1.0E-15 atoms/cc or they
will explode, BOOM, with a consequent reduction in the ship\'s opperational
capabilities.  Atmospheric flight is accomplished through the use of
thermal scramjets driven by heat from the fusor), Standby consumes 
considerable amounts of fuel, about 10% what is used in normal opperations,
but a ship can be lifted from Standy in the time it takes to spool the
lifters.
     A ship can also be lifted from Low Standby in an emergency.  This
involves omitting the pre-takeoff checklist, and thus any chance of
discovering if there is something wrong with the vessel (In Eight Worlds
game mechanics, I roll dice before each liftoff to determine if there
is a malfunction in any of the ship systems.  This chance depends on
the quality of the vessel.  If the crew perform their pre-takeoff 
checklist, they get a chance, dpependant on the relevant skills, to
detect and prevent the malfunction before it occurs.  If they fail to
do this, they must prevent the malfunction after it occurs, which is
considerably more difficult and entertaining.)
     [Sultry voice] "Sir, that\'s not the truck from the chandlery, it\'s 
a truckload of Plieades Federation death cyborgs.  Ick."
     "Alert!  Secure for lift!  Pilot!  Hit it!"
     Cloonk.
     "No!  I meant hit the throttles!"
     Ting.

     "Working on it Cap\'n."
     "Altitude 6300 meters, speed 0 meters per second."
     "Johnathan, better hurry."
     "Altitude 5680 meters, speed negative 120 meters per second."
     "B\'son, what\'s our estimated time to impact?"
     "Hard to say sir, it depends heavily on aerodymanic effects,
and whether our trajectory carries us into that mountain range over
there.  Altitude 3980 meters, speed negative 220 meters per second."
     "B\'son, I want an answer!"
     "Sir, I gave you an answer.  Perhaps your request was 
insufficiently specific."
     "Damn Kiwade and their crazy sense of humor!  Why couldn\'t I

     "Altitude 100 meters speed 300 meters per second.  Do you wish
me to strike the throttles for good measure?"
     "NO!"
     [Sultry voice] "Captain?  Ground control wants to know why we
took off without clearance."

     FULL- Opperational at full power.  In Eight Worlds ship opperations
Full power is only used during manuvers or combat.  During the long
10-20 hour coast out to the jump limit the ship is usually dropped
back down to Reserve.

     [Sultry voice] "Captain?  I\'ve found the seat covers I ordered.
Special padded seat covers made from fireproof Nomex cloth with

     "Very good Ensign Peters, let\'s see them."
     "PAISLEY!!!"
     [Hurt sultry voice] "It was the only color they had."

     Bringing a Ship Up is an ancient ritual, refined by 1500 years of

for anyone who is interested.

Could it also be that they want to give that impressoin(of incompetance)?

After all if you think they are incompitant, then how much time are you
going to spend thinking up plans to put them out of the picture?  Alot less
I would guess.  Also with mining, it may simply look like incompitance
to the untrained eye?

RE: Paul Gazis

Your descriptions of different states of readiness seems to overlap some. 
RESERVE implies that the powerplanet \'fusors\' are running, but the description
does not match.

RESERVE- Fusors up, drives ready, ship pre-flighted and on internal  power.

LOW STANDBY- Engineering systems on line at low power, ship ready to  lift
after drives and fusors have been warmed up and pre-takeoff checklist  has been
completed.

In my mind, there should be the states:

DEAD         :  No energy being generated or used:
BATTERY POWER:  Battery power is available.  Doors, life support, lighting,
                controls may be turned on or off.  Computer will drain
                batteries within an hour if used.
BATTERY DIAG :  Normally a set of diagnostics are run on battery power before
                bringing up the main power plant.  Takes 5-15 minutes.
POWER CHARGE :  Charge the power plant in preperation to starting it.
                Can take minutes to hours depending on TL.
POWER START  :  Main fusion power plant is running at minimum capacity.  Full
                power is available within a moment.  Computer is available.
POWER DIAG   :  Normally a set of diagnostics are run to fully check the ship\'s
                systems.  Takes an hour or more.
MANEUVER WARM:  Apply power to the maneuver drives and ready for full power.
                Takes a moment.
GRAVITY START:  Ship\'s gravitics lift off the ship from the surface.
MANEUVER START: Ships\'s maneuver drives produce appropriate thrust at
                appropriate altitude.
JUMP DIAG    :  Diagnostics are run for the Jump Drive.
JUMP WARM    :  Minimum energy is applied to the Jump Drive.
JUMP DIAG    :  Diagnostics are run again for the Jump Drive.
JUMP START   :  The Jump Drive is energized, and the ship transfers to jump space.
JUMP MAINT   :  Jump Drive runs to maintain Jump.
JUMP STOP    :  Jump Drive is ??? to exit Jump.

most ships are kept at POWER STARTed state if they are going to be used within
the next month, or if there is crew aboard.  Naturally, the diagnostic steps
can be skipped.  The drives can each also be cold started with significant
chances of failure.

Hi everyone,

I am somebody who has been away from the game Traveller for a while and has 
been somewhat surprised by all the changes. (Guass Pistols?!?!? What\'ll they
come up with next?)   

Being a rabid C programmer both by trade and as a hobby I am always working 
on programs to automate things, in particular stuff like table lookup and 
such.

I know that there are "projects" underway for program development for 
Traveller.   What stage are they in and what needs to be written?  I am 
making myself available.

Hello out there in the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate...
 
	Does anybody out there know anything about the Zhodani, or
about any expansion rules for Psionics?  Just curious, I\'m now playing
a Zhodani Nobleman psionic in our local traveller game.  We\'ve got the
module, Expedition To Zhodane, and I\'ve got Journal #23, with Zhodani
Philosophies.  I *used* to have the Zhodani Alien Module (#4).  For the
longest time it was lying around collecting dust because I was hardly
ever playing traveller, and when I was I wasn\'t playing Zhodani, and now
that I finally need it, I can\'t find it!  (I *think* I leant it to some-
body...)
 
	I\'m thinking of writing a little expansion for psionics - not
to increase the power, but to fill in some gaps that seem to be in the
rules (telepathy, for example, jumps from skill 5 strength 2 sending
thoughts to skill 9 strength 9 probing...  what about the skills and
strengths in between?) and to add some techniques for using existing
psi abilities ("flickerscanning" for example, using sense thoughts by
skimming rapidly through a large crowd of people looking for key thoughts
or intentions - after which the psi would follow-up with a direct sense
thoughts) and some non-psi techniques for dealing withh psis ( the "jingle"
method of keeping your mind from being read, from Alfred Bester\'s _The
Demolished Man_).  Maybe (very iffy) some new minor technologies that
can be used by psis (psionically sensitive material that can have a message
or image psionically imprinted on it).  Any other thoughts occur?

Most of that is concerned with safety, and especially air traffic control -
waiting for your turn to take off. The question says "in a real hurry", so a
more valid comparison would be with a fighter getting scrambled. Anyone
know how long that takes?

In my last campaign (Pre Rebellion in Spinward and Deneb) the players 
travelled around for som months with the Zho Thought Police Blensh
Desdiliepr (They had the common goal of preventing the 6:th (sic!) Frontier
War). She had the special dicipline of being able to add to positive DM
in combat by spending psi points on a two for  basis (If this was going
to be used by a Player Character rather than a NPC I\'d recomend one for one!)

     Sigh, \'tis true.  I admit it.  I do not have my rules memorized and

     I knew that!  I knew that!  I was just testing to see if you were
paying attention.

>In my mind, there should be the states: 
>[description of states follows]

     The heart of the matter.  Yes, you have chosen fine states.  They
are goodly states indeed.  I will be the first to admit that your states
are every bit as good as mine.  Maybe better.  However...
     Your states appear to be chosen on the basis of crew activities, 
mine were chosen on the basis of power consumption and drive functionality.  
Other possibilities exist as well (weapons functionality, avionics status, 
opperational level of the Feel-O-Tron, etc.)  The particular choice of 
opperational states would seem to depend upon the nature of the starcrew 
subculture, the availability of Feel-O-Trons, and the whimsy of the GM.
A martial culture may only be concerned with the weapons.  A race of
hedonists may wait in line for the Feel-O-Tron.  Eight Worlds ships are 
TERRIBLY fuel limited so fuel management becomes THE overriding issue.
     And oh yes I forgot.  Fuel consumption and power level also
determine the extent to which the ship is visible to passive sensors.
This has, at times, been a matter of supreme importance.

TECHNICAL NOTE: 
     There are no GRAVITICS in the Eight Worlds universe.  Eight Worlds  
spacecraft are propelled by reaction drives, the way the gods meant Man 
to propel spacecraft.  No inertial compensation either.  Grunt snort.
     There are also no Feel-O-Trons in the Eight Worlds, to the dismay
of PCs who think that this would be an acceptible alternative to
inertial compensation.

About starships, airliners, and fighter planes:

Northrop claims that an F-20 can go from sitting on the runway with the pilot
drinking coffee to 20,000 feet and firing missiles at incoming enemy bombers in
less than a minute.  We can reasonably assume it takes about twice that long.
The MegaTraveller rules state that it takes 3d6 X 30 seconds to warm-start the
fusion plant on a parked starship or small craft, which works out to about 5
minutes.  If you add in safety checks like you\'re supposed to, you have to make
a Cautious task attempt, which means it takes twice as long, or 10 minutes.
Once we add in taxi and takeoff times, it appears that spacecraft in Traveller
take about as long to take off if they\'re following traffic control rules as
our airliners do.

Let\'s examine a typical Traveller case of a PC group in a hurry to take off.
Scout Susan Blaire is surveying a Tech Level 0 world.  She leaves her Type/S
Scout/Courier in "low fuel consumption park" mode as she plans to move on to
another continent the next day.  While outside her ship, she encounters natives
of the Ooga-Booga tribe (a minor race of humaniti).  While conversing with their
Grand High Poobah by use of her CLT, she rolls a fumble and manages to offend
His High Grumpiness.  Her attempt to patch things up (a hazardous, fateful
Liason test) results in a Destroyed mishap.  She decides to run for her life.

She manages to get back to her ship 2 1/2 minutes ahead of the pursuing savages.
Crash-starting her scout ship requires a Routine, Pilot, Dex, 30 sec.  Letting
TL 0 savages see a TL 15 scout ship is against Scout Service regulations, so
she decides to rush things a bit.  Her dexterity of 10 and her Pilot skill of 2
combine to give her a +4 DM on the task attempt.  Normally she would need a 7+
since this is a routine task, but since she\'s making a hasty attempt the 
difficulty goes up one level, to an 11+.  She rolls a 7 (which converts to an 
11 by her +4 DM), indicating success.  She rolls an 12 for her time roll, which
would normally mean a time of six minutes.  But because of the hasty task 
attempt, she subtracts twice her DM\'s from the roll, for a total of 4, meaning
it takes her two minutes to get her scout off the ground.  Thirty seconds later,
the Ooga-Boogas rush into the clearing where she had been parked, only to find
her mysteriously gone.  Such are the ways of the gods...

Notice that in the above example, it took about as long to get the scout ship
off the ground as it does to scramble a typical fighter plane.  However, in her
rush to get off the ground to avoid a code break, Sue forgot her safety checks,
making her task attempt uncertain.  Unless the referee also rolls a 7 or better,
Sue might just find herself stranded on this TL 0 planet... such are the risks
you take in lifting in a big hurry.

RE: "There are no GRAVITICS in the Eight Worlds universe.  Eight Worlds  
    spacecraft are propelled by reaction drives, the way the gods meant Man  to

My inclusion of gravity drive was done for a couple of reasons:

Traveller spaceships assume that there is some kind of artificial gravity for
the living quarters orientation at least.  The rules sort of assume that except
for fighters, all ships have artifical gravity.  If they have artificial
gravity, I assume that it\'s strength can be varied.  It may not be dymanic
enough to cushion a crash, but it can certainly be set to some static value to
counteract acceleration.

I have yet to fathom how the majority of Traveller ships land and take off with
out some kind of gravity or auxiliary thrusters.  Take the scout ship, which
has the drive in the stern, yet lands horizontally.  How does it take off or
land in a wilderness as a scout should be able to do?  Since Traveller ships
obviously have some gravitics, why not use some form of gravity drive for at
least the initial liftoff?

I wish Traveller would either explictly define the spaceships gravity drive, or
explain how these ships land and take off without them.  And allow for ships
designs with and without the gravity drives.

According to the REFEREE\'S COMPANION, maneuver drives work by combining 
gravitics and nuclear dampers technology.  The strong molecular force is 
manipulated by a grav field to push against large plates mounted in the
stern of the ship.  Presumably, although the thruster plates themselves
lack the projective capabilities of grav modules, the grav modules that
are in the m-drive are used by themselves to lift the ship off the ground.
Once airborne, the ship then switches to the thruster plates for primary
locomotion.  That\'s how a type/S with its thruster plates in the stern can
land on a planet on its belly.

The new Starship Ops Manual from DGP addresses this matter; it seems that
thruster plates have a limited but usable efficiency in other directions
than straight back, so a ship with thrusters in back can lift straight up
if its engines are powerful enough.

Usually what\'s done is that the ship lifts in a horizontal attitude, slowly
tilts back in midair until it points straight up, then boosts. The reverse
process is used for landing. (Alternatively, if there\'s an air-traffic hold
pattern, horizontal flight is also possible.)

I thought that the starship operators\' guide explaned a lot of these
areas such as take-off procedures and gravitics. I haven\'t read this
in several months, so I may be mistaken...

Has anyone else seen the new MegaTraveller book "World Builder\'s guide"
(I think that is the exact title...It is difficult to think of these things
when they are on the shelf at home, and I am at work.) I have caught
at least 5 minor errors, and several differences between the examples

Greetings fellow travellers;

I am getting ready to start up a new campaign, and have a small problem.
There will be a lot of spacecraft the players will be interacting with,
and I don\'t want to have to lug around a ton of books.  I was wondering
if there are any programs available that would let me either read in a
set of plans (using a scanner) or enter the plans in some way, store
them in a database, and let the players or myself recall them and/or
print them out as we need.  I would prefer it to work on a pc on a CGA
( :-(  card at a minimum (ega or vga preferred), but do have a Macintosh
available if there is software there.  I do not want suggestions such as
"Use Macdraw or MacPaint".  I am looking for something a bit more
oriented towards what I want it to do.  I also am not interested in
AutoCAD, since it costs $ 3000.

News flash!

There has been a slight delay of service over the last two days, and I
have been very silent.  Problem is my little automatic file custodian
program that skulks around at 1am came alive and went mad, removing all
files that hadn\'t been modified in 24 hours.  So, I had to restore all
my files and I hope I haven\'t lost any mail messages or list traffic.

Now we return you back to your regularly scheduled programming.

ARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!   Your about 6 months too early!   I am ATTEMPTING to 
produce just such a program for the IBM compatibles...   Haven\'t been able 
to spend enough time working on it tho\'.    Do me a favor and EMAIL me a set
of specs that would be EXACTLY what you are looking for.   Part of why this 
project has taken so long is a lack of specs.

       EIGHT WORLDS DRIVE SYSTEMS AND FLIGHT OPPERATIONS

Drine Systems
     Eight Worlds physics does not seem to allow for gravitics
technology.  Eight worlds ships have three drive systems:

     1) Hyperdrive.  Hyperdrive relieves much of the tedium of
interstellar travel, provided that no attempt is made to employ
it too near an interfering mass.  If this precaution is omitted,
the ship explodes, relieving ALL the tedium of interstellar flight.
The minimum distance at which hyperdrive can be employed without
explosive consequences (the infamous \'jump limit\') is dependant
upon the intrinsic curvature of space, which quantity is, of 
course, equivalent to local tidal forces.  Thus, the jump limit is 
proportional to the cube root of the interfering mass.
     The jump limit for a terrestrial mass is about 1.0E+06 km.
The jump limit Sol is somewhere around the orbit of Mercury.  Or
perhaps Venus.  Who cares?  Both are worthless rocks.  The point
is that hyperdrive CAN be used for intrasystem transit, should one 
wish to travel to Io to replenish one\'s sulphur supply.  This is NOT 
the case in a system of habitable planets in orbit around a star of 
type M or smaller.  Which had important strategic consequences after 
the collapse of the Imperium.
     Hyperspace jumps appear to conserve momentum.  Certain aspects
of hyperspace jumps appear to allow for violation of causality, but
the relevant experiments are beyond the finacial capacity of any 
existing civilization.
     2) Fusion drives.  These are open core magnetic confinement 
fusion reactors which function as high specific impulse reaction 
drives.  (The most common configuration is a leaky tandem mirror
machine which burns D + D -> Useless Hot Junk.  The Useless Hot Junk 
heats reaction mass to provide thrust.)  Fusion drives are are used 
for planetary approaches and departures, to match velocity with a 
destination, and for Space Laser Tag, a fast-paced competitive sport 
with a simple and easily understood scoring system which is quite 
popular beyond the Frontier.
     Drives are not particularly useful without associated structure 
to keep the ship from collapsing.  I lump the mass and cost of the
load-bearing structure in with the mass and cost of the drives.  An 
interesting consequence of this approach is that it does not matter how 
much acceleration the ship pulls.  The structure of a 200 tonne ship 
with 200 tonnes of cargo accelerating at 2 Gs is under the same load
(4 MNewtons) if the ship dumps its cargo and flees at 4 Gs.  The crew, 
however, may notice a subtle change in their level of squishedness.
     Since fusion drives have open cores, they can\'t be used inside
an atmosphere lest the atmosphere leak in around the sides of the
plasma column, induce heavy-ion instabilities, and cause the ship
to explode boom.
     3) Atmospheric drives.  These are commonly known as \'Lifters\',
and consist of an assortment of thermal turbojets and scramjets
driven by waste heate from the power plant.  (Eight worlds power
plants are closed core high-field magnetic confinement devices 
which commonly use the D + Li6 -> 2He4 cycle.  The energetic alpha
particles are then run through an MHD generator.  No muss, no fuss,
no radiation, and if there are any leaks in the system the crew all 
sound like Donald Duck.  It\'s great.)  Lifters are used to lift off, 
tool around the planet, depart the atmosphere, or land.  In the hands 
of unskilled crew, lifters can also be used to crash.
     Since lifters are part of the technology necessary to land on
a planet, I lump them in with streamlining, along with the aeroshell,
stabilizing fins, landing jacks, and paint job.  The thrust limitation
for lifters is imposed by the ship\'s load-bearing structure.  There
is no obvious benefit to attaching a 200 MNewton lifter system to
a ship which can only stand 8 MNewtons of thrust.

Flight Opperations
     This is, of course, all very great and keen and all, but does not
answer the question \'How do you land these things?\'  (A question I have
often asked while landing my hang glider.)
     Most Eight Worlds ships are tail-landers (The drives are aligned 
along the aerodynamic axis of the ship and they land on their tails...  
What WERE you thinking!)  This is a fine and dandy configuration which 
has been used successfully on any number of wierd experimental aircraft
back during the 1950s when they didn\'t know any better.  There was
also a bizarre proposal to build a tail-landing version of an F-16
for use on small naval vessels.  Ick.  Tail landers are not all THAT
hard to land (my hang glider is arguably a tail lander if it is landed
correctly.  At other times it is a nose lander), but they can fall over
once they are on the ground.  The usual cause of such accidents is
soil failure, which grows more likely as the weight, and hence the
ground pressure of the ship, increase.  The maximum safe weight for
landing a tail-lander on a compacted dirt field is 400 tonnes, which
co-incidentally is the size of most Eight Worlds trading ships.  My
my.  Another cause of toppling incidents are careless PC starcrew who 
land their ship on a 45 degree slope.  It was fun, it was great, you 
should have been there.
     An alternative configuration is a belly-lander.  Belly-landers have
their primary drives aligned along the aerodynamic axis, but possess
an additional set of lifters or a thrust vectoring scheme which allows
them to hover in a horizontal orientation.  That this scheme is feasible
is proven by one of NASA\'s AV-8 Harriers which even now is hovering
outside my window producing a terrible racket and making it difficult
to do any serious work.  Belly-landers are more stable on the ground, 
a field which can handle a tail-lander can handle a belly-lander of 2-3 
times the size.  With their extra lifters they are also a tad more
manuverable in the atmosphere.  But belly-landers have two problems:
     1) There is an extra mass and cost penalty, equal to 50% the cost 
of streamlining.  This penalty has proven prohibitive for small ships,
which do not need belly-landing gear anyway so who cares.
     2) The coffee mugs fall off the shelves.  This problem is generic
generic to all Eight Worlds ships when they make the transition from
space to atmospheric flight, but it is much worse for belly-landers
since it persists after they are on the ground.  Eight Worlds ship 
designers use lots of velcro, and draw heavily on 1950s Sci Fi flicks 
for their deck plans.  The results are agreed by all to be somewhat
unsatisfactory.

More Flight Ops
     Nope.  No more flight ops.  I lied.

[Belatedly retransmitted -- reply to Pierson@Encore reply to Adrion]

Dan & Adrion,

I had just *assumed* that were were using low-power aiming mode on our
laser shoulder-weapons.  Iron sights are for the birds if you\'re not shooting
lead.

A current riot-control assault rifle has a VISIBLE-red aiming laser slung under
the barrel -- the red bouncing dot tends to having a calming effect on the 
rioter(s) its aimed at, I\'m told.

For efficient transfer of energy from battery to victim, i suspect killing
lasers *are not* in the visible spectrum.  The only operaiontal deathray
I know of today, in man-aimable form, is a Maser -- called a navy gunnery
target designation radar.  Technicians supposedly adjust its iron sights by
aiming at a seagull (*Never an albatross!*) and squeezing the "trigger".
Basically a high-power, lasing, radar gun that produces instant oven
fried seagull at 30 paces and calls homing smart-bombs when painted on
large naval targets far away.

RE: F-20s

      Northrop has, in fact,demonstrated the ability of an F-20 to be
airbourne at 20,000 feet some absurdly small time after the pilot has
been strapped into the cockpit.  What has NOT been revealed is how
long the crew chief has had to beat on the plane beforehand.
      In striking contrast, the most optomistic time NASA even quoted
for turning around a shuttle was something like a month.
     A few minutes to do a fast launch, a few weeks.  Both times are
utterly reasonable.  Take your pick.

Looking at this another way... when an US Navy ship prepares to get underway
from "Cold Iron" this can take a couple of days.  When it tries the same stunt
from some sort of "warm start" it can just be a few hours.

I think somewhere in the Traveller rules, it is mentioned that only ships
with a certain configuration (needle/cone and wedge) can take off and land
on planets with an atmosphere.  It seems to me that because they
are aerodynamic, they must be able to take off and land horizontally.  This
could be why scouts only need to have drives in the rear.

But (now for the bit where I demolish my own argument), this doesn\'t work
in worlds with gravity and no atmosphere, where it won\'t be possible to get
enough lift for horizontal flight.  So possibly some kind of launch ramp could
be used as a compromise between horizontal and vertical lift off (this of
course raises the question of uninhabited zero atmosphere planets....).

     I  have only recently become aware of the Traveller  mailing 
list but have devoted many hours to creating Traveller  software. 
So by means of introduction I will list some of the things I have 
worked  on. Interested parties please e-mail me and if  there  is 
enough general interest I will post it to the list.
     Most  of  the  code  is fairly  portable  as  it  was  first 
developed under Berkely Unix then ported to a MS-DOS PC.

                    jaymin@maths.tcd.ie
                    jaymin%maths.tcd.ie@cunyvn.cuny.edu

     LANGUAGES. I was always annoyed that the original  Traveller 
didn\'t have language generation for English (Villani). So after a 
series  of programs I now have one that will take a  given  text, 
parse  it  in repeated passes and try to find  the  best  fitting 
syllabic pattern. It then effectively generates a table like  the 
standard  ones.  There is another trivial program  that  actually 
generates  the words. It worked well on English,  brilliantly  on 
Maori; I am unqualified to judge the results on German and  Irish 
but  it  couldn\'t adequately parse Latin. Its  assumptions  about 
syllables occurring independently within a word just don\'t work.

     YET  ANOTHER CHARACTER GENERATOR. I am sure it doesn\'t  have 
much  over the others but the one nifty feature it does  have  is 
that you can set the interaction level. I.e. you can specify that 
the  computer is to make the decisions as to what cascade  skills 
to pick up to even choosing when to muster out, etc.

     SCALED  HEX MAPPING. The idea is to design a map at  several 
different  scales.  You can go up to the  largest,  mark  several 
hexes  as hills, go down a few levels and add the finer  details. 
It turned out not to be as useful as I first thought.

     YET  ANOTHER  TRADE PROGRAM. Handles what is  available  and 
keeps a record of where you have been. Not very sophisticated.

     YET   ANOTHER  SYSTEM  GENERATOR.  Scouts  expanded   system 
generator. Not much more I can say.

     ZAP. I started ZAP back in college shortly after Elite  came 
out.  I  liked the trading and exploration aspect  of  Elite  and 
strove  to come up with something similar. It uses  the  galactic 
co-ordinates  as a random seed and the system for that  area  (if 
there  is  one)  is generated from that.  Add  a  simple  density 
function  and I have literally an entire galaxy of stars  even  I 
know nothing about.
     System  generation and ship construction are  done  although 
the  latter is not like Traveller. Trading is there but not  very 
well  done.  I  had a combat section done but it  seems  to  have 
disappeared.  Due  to  time pressures its  development  has  been 
rather  slow  over  the  last two years. I want  to  be  able  to 
generate maps of planets next but am having difficulty coming  up 
with  a  good  enough representation (more  of  that  in  another 
posting).
     I  would dearly like for someone to volunteer to  take  over 
development of it. Or best a group development of modules for  it 
al    la   \'nethack\'   centrally   co-ordinated   (Anyone    read 
\'Planiverse\'?). Anyone who might be interested in doing odd  bits 
please e-mail me and perhaps the mailing list might want to adopt 
it.

Mostly true, depending on what you mean by "cold start". From what I
remember when I was in the Navy, if you include the inspections,
preventive maintenance, etc in that, it could take weeks regardless
of what type of power plant you have. However, lets assume that
all of that is out of the way, and that a "cold start" means
that you\'re ready to push the button to star the engines to
generate power. Both nuclear and boiler plants on ships generate
steam to turn the turbines. Generating the temperatures and
pressures for a steam plant average about 8 hours to get to operating
capacity. However, the new gas turbine (read: jet engine) ships

just for this). You may want to consider the purpose of the ship
in determining the cold start time, and whether you want to count
inspections or not (if someone is stealing a ship, did the 
predessors, inspect it?), etc.

Just some things to think about

Along the lines of random life forms:  One of my old campaigns (about 10 years
ago) did not even make the assumption that all sentient life forms would be 
human/humanoid.  Two planets side-by-side could have totally divergent races.
To generate the sentient creatures I used a set of rules from a TSR space game
(the name of which I forget at the moment) for this purpose.   I got life form
types from those rules of everything from humanoids to spiders and everything
in between.

I have dealt with this problem in my game (VERY modified version) by having
four kinds of potentially aerodynamic vehicles.  The first is a lifting body
(i.e. brick-with-wings space shuttle design).  The second is a needle (i.e.
1950\'s rocket w. fins, or something similar).  The third is a stealthed hull
(kind of like a lifting body in shape).  The fourth is a lander (closer to
the LEM than anything else, although another good example is the big moon
lander in 2001).  I don\'t believe in gravity control, etc., so all of these
have to deal with with standard spacecraft dealing with gravity problems.
The only one that is a tail-lander is the lander model; the others have to
deal with the "coffee mugs fall off the shelves problem."  (Actually, my
description of the problem is a little more hideous--all the toilets turn
90 degrees; one hopes that landing procedures includes turning off the 
plumbing for a while, or at least moving modular units into new non-spill
positions.)

Of course, since about 95% of the population in my game world (200 billion 
to 500 billion per average solar system, and sometimes a lot more) lives in
space habitats, and most inhabited planets have their own elaborate shuttle
systems (very useful to keeping out smugglers, terrorists, etc.) this is
not a common problem for players.  (When it is, they velcro the coffee mugs
to the wall and turn off the plumbing for a few hours.)  Usually, your 
spacecraft docks at a habitat\'s spaceport or sits a few hundred kilometers
away if the docking berths are all taken and a space gig comes out to your
ship and shuttles you into the habitats.

NEW TOPIC.  How many people run adventures in large habitats (my typical
large habitat is a rotating cylinder affair 15 km. at the base and 60 km.
from end to end; at each end is an "endwall complex" of enclosed levels
for industries, apartments, etc.--imagine about 700 shopping malls stacked
on top of one another and you\'ll have a rough idea; the endwall levels 
are about 100 m. wide so you get a huge amount of internal space from them--
plus a "dayside," the landscaped interior of the cylinder.  The whole
thing supports about one million people; with the endwall complexes included
the internal surface area is about 4800 square km., of which roughly three
quarters (or two thirds of 3600 square km. if you use narrower endwall levels)
is "indoor" or endwall complex, and the remainder "outdoor" or dayside, 
the latter being used for farms, parks, wilderness preserves, etc.)?
Personally, I am satisfied with a set-up that I find plausible, and I have
found that while microworlds have some limitations (anyone who specialized
in Field Artillery is going to fill a bit left out since using howitzers
inside a habitat is generally considered a bad idea), a million-person
setting can give you some remarkably complex adventure scenarios, and is
a little easier to map out than a billion-person world.  When you finish
one adventure in one habitat, of course, you can always move on to another.
(I assume that in many cases you will get a few hundred to several thousand
habitats clustered around a big asteroid or a large moon--the main source
of raw materials--and they will form a general political alliance.  The
result is that my universe is one where most people live in the galactic
version of an archipeligo.)  Any comments, questions, suggestions?

  (waving hand) ME!  ME!

|(every 5!) silly as well, and while many aspects are covered, there sure
|is a lot of dice rolling (and as far as I can tell, there are provisions
|for critical failures but not critical successes).
 
  I use a slightly modified task system in 2300AD (don\'t play MT).  My task
  levels use steps of 2 (I.E. Trivial=1, Simple=3, Easy=5, Routine=7, 
  Challenging=9, Difficult=11, Hard=13, Formidable=15, Overwelming=17,
  Unreasonable=19, Near Impossible=21, Impossible=22) and I have shifted
  skill rolls to using 2d6 instead of 1d10 (the curve makes the difference
  between difficulties more reasonable).  I\'m trying to figure out how to
  fit the hit locations table to 2d6 so I can dispense with d10\'s completely.

  Another change I made, mainly to the Melee Combat system, the the ability to
  choose your maneuvers.  Instead of striking at Routine all the time, you may
  choose to do a "Hard" strike, requiring a "Overwelming" block.  This allows
  those trained in the martial arts to perform those hard-to-stop strikes on
  the lesser trained.  A side note to this rule is that if you choose a more
  difficult strike, and you fail the skill roll, you are considered 
  "off-balance" and your next block is made at one level (2 point level)
  increased difficulty.  As a ref you can handle this system two ways:

     1) Descriptive: "I do a high snap kick to his head!"  "Ok, that\'s a 
        Difficult Strike"
     2) Specific: "I do a Challenging Punch"

  The first method adds more color to the game as the players come up with
  flashy kicks and punches, but forces the referee to make judgement calls
  on the actual difficulties.  The second is quicker, but pretty dry.

  I also use a slightly shifted attribute modifier chart.  It goes something
  like this:
   
    Level Mod       Level Mod        Level Mod        Level Mod
       1   -6          7   -1          13    0          19   +2
       2   -5          8   -1          14   +1          20   +3
       3   -4          9   -1          15   +1          21   +3
       4   -3         10    0          16   +1          22   +3
       5   -2         11    0          17   +2          23   +4
       6   -2         12    0          18   +2          24   +4

  Example:  Joe Scout is walking though the woods, making geographic notes when
  he suddenly spots a Kafer mob heading toward his position.  Since running
  would alert them to his presence, he decides to hit the bushes and hide.
  There is no "Hiding" skill -- it\'s simply a matter of choosing the right 
  place and being quiet.  Joe is reasonably Intelligent (14) and has a skill of
  2 in Survival.  He must make an Uncertain task roll to find the right cover.
  The ref decides that given the fact he can\'t move very far, but given the
  amount of cover available, it is a Routine task.  Joe get to add 2 for his
  skill and +1 for his intelligence for a 4+ for success.  If both he and the
  referee roll 4+, he\'s well hidden from simply being seen.  If either Joe or
  the ref fail their roll, he\'s hidden, but could be spotted (his butt\'s 
  sticking out or something.  If both fail, this turkey is trying to hide 
  behind a sapling.  If Joe did not have a skill in survival, He would have to
  make a challenging task roll, adding ONLY his intelligence modifier.

|I myself simply cannot stomach it (and consequently have been trying to

  The Task system is okay, you just have to tweak it a bit here and there.
  Once a few changes are made it works fine.

Well, since I think it\'s absolutely the greatest thing since sliced toast, 
I suppose the answer to that question would be yes.

You must be playing with the old Digest Group version of the rules (published
in GRAND SURVEY, GRAND CENSUS, and TRAVELLER: 2300), which makes you make a
"failure roll" whenever you fail.  The new version of the task system, which
appears in MEGATRAVELLER (and, presumably, 2300 AD, although I haven\'t seen
the new edition), eliminates half the die rolling by replacing the failure
roll with rules for exceptional success and exceptional failure.  (This also
addresses the other gripe you had.)  

In the new system, whenever you succeed by more than 2, it\'s an exceptional
success.  When you fail by more than 2, it\'s an exceptional failure.  (I
say "more than 2," but it\'s really 2+, which I feel is too small a margin).
A natural 2 is still always a fumble.  Exceptional failure on a hazardous
task or ordinary failure on a fateful task results in a 2D mishap.  Fumbling 
a hazardous task, or getting exceptional failure on a task that is both
hazardous AND fateful, results in a 3D mishap.  The rules don\'t say this 
either, but I suppose that you could make a case for rolling four dice on
the mishap table if you fumble a haz/fate task....

As for the 4-point separation between difficulty levels, I frequently find
myself applying arbitrary -1, +1, or +2 modifiers to some tasks as a means
of "fine-tuning" them in specific cases.  These modifiers get added in on
an ad hoc basis for specific cases of tasks and don\'t go in my task library
(except in unusual cases...).  They let me fine-tune the difficulty of 
individual attempts to get the right balance.  But I wouldn\'t publish them 
in an adventure or supplement -- the levels they give are supposed to be
general guidelines, not straitjackets.  They work well for me, at least.  A 
typical pilot, for example, with a Dex of 7 and a Pilot skill of 2, making a
Routine, Pilot, Dex check will succeed on a 4+... whereas someone with no
skill needs a 10 or better.  Seems about right to me.

As for the 5-point characteristic bonuses, I like the way they balance out
too as they give characters with superior abilities an edge, but not so much
that they dominate the game.  Remember -- this is Traveller, not AD&D.  The
power curve between strong and weak characters is supposed to be MUCH flatter.
As it stands, you get a +1 on attempts if you have an ability of 10+, and a
- - -1 if you have an ability of 4-, as compared to the average Joe.  In the 
original edition, most die rolls that were affected by abilities started to
hand bonuses or penalties out at somewhere around these levels.

I\'m finding I have a hard time stomaching anything else any more.  I seem
to be having the opposite experience you are with this... instead of causing
a lot of die rolling, the task system I\'ve been using eliminates most of the
die rolling I\'ve had to do (except in cases of fumbles).  Unless the players
are worried about time or a mishap occurs, every task rides on a single die
roll, which can be very rapidly calculated.  

The whole idea behind the task system is that you should be able to easily
memorize it, and apply it without really worrying about mechanics.  The system
lets me take my hands off the mechanics and worry about creating a challenging
adventure and realistic settings and NPC\'s and not the rules of running the
game.  And the sorts of things the system lets you do replace several pages of
new rules for each new task.  I love it.  Star Wars does something similar
with its standard difficulty levels and equally simple mechanics.  

My one gripe about MegaTraveller is its damage system.  PC\'s can take too
much punishment from guns, not enough from melee weapons.  I get around this 
by dividing each damage value for a weapon by 3 (retaining fractions) and 
applying it as 2300-style damage.

Yes, you are missing something.  First off there are critical successes:
In combat, if you have a powerful enough weapon, you can make an instant kill.
The four point thresholds are decent and in my campaign they work.  As for
the stat add thresholds of every five, yeah, they are crap.  What I do is
modify the modifier by substracting two or three (I am just trying it recently).
This way if you have very low stats it hurts you, which seems a little more
realistic.  I do like the task system, because it makes for a consistent system
for determining whether you have accomplished something.  It allows for better
roleplaying because it gives the players a better idea of what the likelihood
of accomplishing a task would be. (I would give an examle, but right now I 
am in a hurry.)

As for 2300AD... Do I like it? Well, yes. I have a 2300AD campaign which is
over a year old going very well right now.

Very interesting...  But it seems like an awful lot of handwaving to explain

	I think Space Habitats can be used very nicely for a campaign setting
(although at the moment I\'m biased, having just finished _Vacuum_Flowers_).
I also think that they will rarely show up in traveller campaigns.  Personally,
I think the Imperium is too friggin\' big!  The GM should pick a nice-sized
chunk and flesh it out a lot (detail on each world, sprinkle a few space
habitats and curiosities around, etc).  Back to the subject...

	Two good books for Space Habitat background:  Christopher Rowley\'s
_Starhammer_ and Michael Swanwick\'s _Vacuum_Flowers_.  The latter is cyber-
punk, and has space habitats ranging from orbiting cans to dyson worlds to
cometary settlments.  It\'s a good book which I highly reccomend for reading for
personal pleasure, and it could serve as a nice little unusual but highly
fleshed out system for Traveller (hmm... that\'s an idea, take fifty or a
hundred of your favorite SF books and "place" them in a chunk of imperial
space, either carefully subsituting for near matches or merely putting them
where you like...).
 
	The problem with Vacuum Flowers is that it is cyberpunk, and much of
the material of the world therein might not match your traveller campaign,
especially the wetware (computer-brain enhancements) and the apparent dichotomy
of technology (wetware, but their space travel is pretty weak, and interstellar
travel non-existent).  You might get around this by making the citizens very
humanoid aliens (but their brain structure is different enough to allow them to
easily use wetware, while normal humans cannot) or by making the fancy tech
VERY dependent upon the rest of the society\'s technology (either because it is
not compatible with tech from other systems, or because it reli

Hi gang,

I was mulling over the idea of warm up times for starship power plants and I 
came to the following thoughts:

Warm up time is going to be highly dependant on the size, age, and maintenance
record of the power plant in question.  Larger, older, and less maintained 
power plants are going to take longer to come on line than a smaller, newer,
well maintained power plant.  

I think of my 77 Plymouth Volare station wagon.  It has a "slant 6" engine in
it, a medium size, very reliable motor.  Because it is old and its previous 
owner didn\'t take very good care of it, it tends to be a little 
cantankerous in the morning.   A freind of mine has a souped up Chevy (size of 
motor unknown, just very souped!) and because it is a complex beasty it 
doesn\'t want to start on any but the nicest day and it complains at that!

What is my point?  I am just trying to say that you really can\'t have a hard 
fast set of rules about starships run up times.   I think a great deal of 
flexibility has to be applied to the question.

A while ago, I asked a friend of mine, who knows a lot more about 
economics than I do, and is also an avid Traveller player to help me
come up with a way the interstellar taxation system works.
This is how I/we work it.
	1) The imperium takes a slice from the military spending of
		all member planets to help pay for the navy etc.
	2) Most if not all planets have their own internal taxation 
		(income taxes/property taxes etc.)
	3) The Imperium prohibits import duties on all member planets
		except for small income tarrifs, which are
		discouraged.
	4) The imperium imposes a value-added tax on all manufacturing
		on Hi-Pop worlds.

Mostly we find that your average wandering free trader does not have
to pay too much in the way of taxes, as 1 and 4 don\'t apply to them at
all, and they rearely have to pay income taxes at home and the tarrifs
can be assumed to be built into the price system.  There are always
exceptions. "What do you mean I owe seven years back income tax I
haven\'t been here in seven years.  Oh yeah, you gave me citizenship
didn\'t you?"

This subject came up (Actually I brought it up :-)) on the star system 
generation group, and I was wondering about everone\'s opinion on this:

What does everyone assume about stellar phenomenon? There has never been a
place for generating black holes, neutron stars, nebula, dust clouds, 
pulsars etc. in the rules.

I have always assumed that there were a lot more stars than are actually drawn
on the map. The other "unmapped" stars would only be of passing interest to 
Scientists (1 month research trips and unmanned montioring probes). All of 
these "stars" would have two things in common:
a) no fuel to speak of (interstellar hydrogen, occasionaly a comet or two) 
b) no solid surfaces to put bases or other strucures on.

Therefore they are not placed on the maps as jumpspace effectively ignores 
everything between the entry/exit points (The navigator worries about 
them and their possible influence but not anyone else).

I seem to recall some rules (Leviathin/Zhodani module? I\'m going to have to
bring my rules into work...) That seemed to make it extraordinarily difficult
to map the area that you are in. I believe that even with today\'s
technology, we could map the majority of the imperium without leaving earth
(albeit only star locations).
This inconsistancy (as I see it) could be accounted for if there was other
stellar objects that are not of interest.

Also did everyone get a copy of the latest one Vol 8.

If not let me know. it was the begining of a replacement system

Here is something that I occured to me on this great discussion about trying
to get bast the 6-G barrior.  What ever happened to the good old fashoned
ROCKET!!.  They aren\'t bothered by any warping in the time/space/whatever
fields.  They just shoot and shoot.  I would be intersted to see if someone
can come up with a viable versions.  They would obviously be limmeted to
ships about 600t and smaller simply because they would take up so much room.
Admittedly their main disadvantage would be size.  But they have two advantages
and that is:a) alows you to use a manuever 6 plus the rockets to get that total
of manuever 12.  b) cost.  They would still be cheaper per manuever then a
manuever drive.  Though another disadvantage is a wpn hitting the O2 tanks.
plus they couldn\'t be fully refueled at a gass giant. Minor things, but when
you need that extra burst of speed in the middle of combat.

Another minor problem is getting the inerial compensators to work for those high
G\'s.  but then again modern fighter pilots regularly are under sustained 5-6G
manuevers.  Then bring in the 6G compensators would bring the 12G acceleration
to a simple 6G felling for the crew and passengers.

Yea I know some of this doesn\'t make sense, but when you right on the fly, not
everything can work out perfectly.

Well, the simplest method is as follows.

Grav-plates utilise gravity-type forces to overcome the \'real\' gravity
produced by a planet, and to provide thrust. Repulsors use similar forces
to keep enemy missiles away. What\'s their theory of operation? I don\'t know,
go and ask a gravitics scientist!

After all, how many computer users could give you a detailed account of just
how little lumps of silicon deliberately made impure to create junctions
can do what computers do? Do many jet fighter pilots have any knowledge of
the chemistry of jet fuel? Do many starship pilots really know the inside
story of their manoeuvre drives?

If the PC\'s want to make life difficult for the referee by going and asking a
gravitic scientist, then the scientist (after giving them an appointment -
he\'s got more important things to do, after all) gives them a nice long lecture
involving enough 3rd order differential equations to make them sick of
gravitics for the rest of their lives.

Almost all SF has some kind of sufficiently advanced technology to make the
story interesting - in Traveller, it\'s gravitics, nuclear dampers and jump
drives. It isn\'t really necessary to come up with long explanations of how it
all works. As far as the PC is concerned, all that is important is that it
does work, or that he/she can apply a suitable skill to repair it if it
doesn\'t.

Or, if you must invent long explanations for everything in order for it to
be plausible for you, then you\'ll have to also write long essays on just
what is involved in such skills as Starship Tactics, Demolition, Admin, and
all the rest. And no cheating by saying "Well, such things are understood,
but I\'m not an expert".

I\'m not sure what you mean by all this, but I think you may
be confusing space-time distortion with Heisenberg
uncertainty.  The former is a relativistic effect, and the
latter a quantum mechanical one.

One of the beautiful features of Einstein\'s formulation of
special and general relativity is that the effects of
space-time distortion are deterministic, in the same sense
that classical mechanics is deterministic:  If you have
complete information about the state of a system at time T,
you can perfectly calculate its state at all future times
T+t.  (Note that the notion of time here *is* a little
confusing -- suffice it to say that any relativistic system
is completely causal, i.e. time flows forward only, and that
it is always possible to synchronize all the "local clocks"
to any causal "master clock", which you can then think of as
"the" clock...)  Indeed, for any reasonably advanced society,
the calculations shouldn\'t be much more difficult.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a fundamental feature
of quantum mechanics.  Quantum mechanics, unlike relativity,
is a completely non-deterministic theory:  Even if you could
have complete information about the state of a system at time
T, you could only calculate the *probability* of the system
being in some other specified state at time T+t.  (In fact,
for *any* state, the probability of the system moving to that
state is nonzero -- just so low that it will "never" happen
in the expected lifetime of this universe!).  But
Heisenberg\'s principle says that you can\'t ever even
*acquire* complete information about the state of a QM
system.  In particular, let the probability that a particle
has a given velocity be P(v), and the probability that it has
a given position be P(x).  Then P(x)P(v) <= C, where C is a
magic constant.  Thus, the more certain you are about *where*
a particle is, the less certain you are about where it\'s
going, and vice-versa.

Thus, the above-quoted statements probably should invoke QM,
or even QCD, the merger of QM with relativistics.  However,
this opens up a whole \'nother nasty can of worms for the
gravitics theorist...

Comments or criticisms, anyone?  I\'m sure there\'s some real
howler lurking in my comments somewhere... :-)

There is some interesting information about taxes in Trillion Credit
Squardon. There is a section on incomes from planets for a campaign game.
If I remember correctly the revenue was 500 Cr per person modified by
government and state of hostilites. This represents just the naval budget.
(Hence the importance of high population worlds to the factions in the
imperium. I have always presumed that this naval budget is split between
the local, Subsector and imperial navys. In this case the imperium gets
money for its fleet in return for protecting the planet (The only thing
the Imperium seems to do for local planets). This implies that the imperium
gets its cut from the locals, but doesn\'t care how they come up with it in the
first place. In this case the planetary government can call on Imperial/Subsector 
forces to help retrieve tax money from citizens or visitors who are reluctant to 
pay.
At 500 Cr per person just for the military (navy), the average family of four
pays 2000Cr per year, then we add in local taxes for the government, which vary
but I usualy use 4x this amount. Resulting in a net Cr8,000 per year. (If I 
remember correctly some crew members only make Cr1,000 a month. - They better not
have large families!)
To answer your questions directly. The imperial portion would be the same,
across the imperium, (but the locals may not collect it equally). Taxes are
collected according to the government type of the planet in question.
Deviousness doesn\'t have to come into it. If you don\'t pay duty etc. no trading
impounding of ship/cargo, etc. (This does bring into question who the full-time
starship crews pay their taxes to?)

If you are dealing at a starport, the imperial reguations regarding
trade would be used (another service provided to the planet!) And a standard
mechanism for payment of taxes, calcualting weights (eg. Imperial Litre :-)),
and paperwork. If you are dealing outside of the starport, you had better have
a good legal skill. (A good incentive to always use the port facilities, even
if there is a slight charge...)

By the way. If you calculate the income from the high population worlds, in the
Imperium, a fleet of 11000 BatRons can be easily maintained.

I remember checking some of this out once. The Traveller rules have stars
spaced approximately correctly. (Ie ave seperation in the range of a parsec
or two).

The problem is that the distribution of stellar types is such that the vast
majority of star are class M dwarfs. These require space based observatories
to locate if they are even a sector away! 

At least it is fairly simple to determine stellar positions given a medium
sized (say 20 inch?) scope on a jump capable ship. Do a full 360 degree
photo survey. Do a Jump-1. Take a second set of photos. Run them thru the
computers to see which images moved and how much. Plot the positions. 
Continue.

Black holes and neutron stars require a supernova to form. These require rather
large (and thankfully rare!) stars. I\'ve seen estimates that place the lethal
radiation zone around a supernova at 15-30 parsecs. So a supernova would *kill*
a sector in all directions! The effects include what amounts to a massive
EMP. So unless your whole planet is using Fiber backup electronics...

We do have a small nebula down in the Aslan area. Except for the small
nebula ("planetary" nebulas) they tend to be sub-sector to sector size. It\'s
not surprising that there are so few in the mapped areas.

An old neutron star or a "brown dwarf" would have interesting possiblities.
A brown dwarf might be able to keep a small *very* close in planet warm enough
to be habitable. And it would be dim enough that it might not have been mapped.
This would make a great adventure....

"The pirate base *has* to be close! Those ships can only do jump-2."
"But there isn\'t anything that close..."  :-)

Yes, but the average seperation is also in 3D space, so we are losing a number
of stars for our 2D representation. There can be many excuses for this
simplification, but as I mentioned, I assume that these other stars are not
interesting, and (for a simple model) vertical movement is unnecessary.

The charts for star creation do not give this distribution, and a viewing a 
sector at a time is good data collection, unlike the core exploration rules
in the Zhodani module.

Perhaps a Jump-6 or two would survey the area faster.

The supernova doesn\'t bother us if it occured 500 Million years ago, there is
no data on the density of black holes as they are so difficult to detect, there
could be ones lingering arond from the big bang (assuming you subscribe to
that theory). There could be a blackhole/neturon star in every sector, or even
every subsector without any having been formed since the time of the Ancients.

Your last point was very good...i think I\'ll use it in my next campaign...

A nuclear astrophysicist\'s view of Dan Corrin\'s query:

>From a Traveller standpoint, all of the unusual stellar phenomena about which 
he\'s wondered are utterly unimportant. Why? Two reasons: scales of stellar
population, and the distribution and density of unusual star types. 

The population distribution of stars with respect to size, age, and light/heat 
output (i.e. luminosity) is a well-understood function, essentially an 
exponential "pyramid" with the brightest stars at the top and the dimmest at
the bottom. For every fairly bright star such as Sirius, there are hundreds
and hundreds of dim red or brown dwarfs like Barnard\'s Star; for every very
bright star like Acrux, there are hundreds of Siriuses. The problem with the
current star system generation tables is that if they reflected the true
population distribution of stars in the primary galactic medium, they\'d bore
the average gamer to tears, because on a 3D6 table you\'d need to roll a 3 or
an 18 to get anything other than a red dwarf, and then you\'d have to roll a 3
or an 18 to get anything in spectral class any higher than F, and so on. From
the point of view of a "pointillistic" star system setup like Traveller or
2300 (i.e., we can only go so far before our engines poop out, so every star
system becomes an important stepping stone), the universe becomes an
intricately detailed and dishwater-dull place. |-> [In all fairness, a
"wide-dispersion" game like Space Opera (i.e., our drives have infinite speed
and range so we can pick and choose which worlds we settle) tends to lean
heavily on bizarre systems and unlikely planetary groups; hence the
Space-Opera nature of the game, where if there\'s no air to breathe normally
outside your Laser-Blazer stellar interceptor craft when you crashland on
Xymox IV, it MUST be a plot device.] In other words, it\'s unreasonable to ask
Traveller for a "more realistic" star system population distribution; if it
got any more realistic we\'d die of boredom, and as it is its departures from
reality are vital if we\'re to have more than a fistful of inhabitable worlds
in the 11000 star systems of the Imperium. 

The fallacy in Dan\'s argument is as follows: Why shouldn\'t it be possible to 
see everything we need to chart, he asks, considering the fact that we can see 
so much just from Earth with today\'s telescopes? The fact is, we really can\'t 
see very much at all! Our vision relies on apparent luminosity, a quantity 
which is heavily dependent on temperature and proximity in a synergistic 
fashion. What this means is that while we see a mixture of red, orange, 
yellow, white, and blue-white stars in our sky, they by no means reflect true 
stellar populations: nearly half of the red dwarfs that we know of can be fit
on the Traveller:2300 Near Star Map with its 50-light-year radius, and the 
bright star Deneb in Cygnus, 1600 miles distant, is used as an example of a 
one-of-a-kind bright star in a stellar population not only by us, but by the 
Vilani as they ply the routes of the First Imperium not far from where we sit, 
by the Aslan as they make their first tentative steps toward the Tlaukhu, by 
the Vargr as they howl their unanswered questions to the moons of Lair, and to 
the Droyne as they look up from their mud huts and beg Yaskoydray to come 
back. As a bright star, Deneb stands alone; the star charts of the Imperium 
reflect this. The Solomani Rim chart features many stars of lesser but still 
bright magnitude; that\'s because we know they exist. In the neighborhood of 
Terra there are three dozen tiny red stars that we can see; if we extrapolate 
this to the rest of the galaxy, we assume that each yellow star is surrounded 
by red ones, and each yellow-star community is part of a cluster that 
surrounds a white star, and so on. 

The Near Star Map, by the way, is lifted from an excellent reference on this 
sort of thing, the Gliese Catalogue of Near Stars, including the Van 
Biesbroeck catalogue, the Ross and Wolf star lists, the American Catalogue, 
and the little-known but very worthwhile Vyssotsky listing of red stars, which
cites a lot of bizarre little details about some of our nearest neighbors; the
true interest in the piddling dwarfs in our back yard comes not from their
size and heat but from their odd behavior. Many are actually multiple star
systems, with companions too small to see; others are variables that flare up
from time to time in bursts of killing heat. There\'s a lot of interest here,
but one has to dig for it. 

And what about nebulae, neutron stars, and black holes? Forget them. They\'re
so rare and distantly spaced, and so noisy by their presence, that in the era
of Traveller we\'d probably know about many times as many of them as we do
now, but the new ones we\'d have found would all be even further away from us
than the ones we know now. There are fewer than a hundred pulsars in our sky,
and none of them is closer than the Crab, which is (I think; let me look it 
up) beyond the range of the Imperium\'s survey maps. The three X-ray sources
believed to be black holes, Cygnus X-1 and X-3 and Scorpius X-1, are even
further distant, their companions blue supergiants that dwarf even Deneb. It\'s
just not feasible to try to generate them randomly; they\'d never come up in a
local area like ours. (There is the possibility of localized dark matter, like
brown dwarfs and black holes without companions, but the former would barely
perturb a jump route unless they happened to move through EXACTLY the path of
a jumping ship, which is ridiculously unlikely, and the latter don\'t make much
sense from a cosmological standpoint.) 

It\'s my opinion that the star system generators should stick to areas where 
any number of guesses might be perfectly okay, as in planetary groupings; we 
only have one system on which to base our guesses as of now, and it\'ll be a 
couple of centuries before we get out to Agidda and learn differently from the 
Vilani. In terms of creating stellar groupings, it\'s unreasonable to have more 
than a miniscule chance of anything more unusual than a single or multiple 
main-sequence star group. Giants, maybe once in a great while; Supergiants, 
almost never; Black holes, no way.

I hope this clears up the question; if not, then I\'ve bored an AWFUL lot of 
people. I\'ll be glad to argue this point with anyone who thinks I\'m wrong from 
a standpoint of realism, but have your references ready: I have mine. As for a 
game-fun standpoint, I believe in doing what needs to be done, of course, but 
there are a lot of ways to spice up a new sector than to sprinkle Wolf-Rayet 
and RR Lyrae stars everywhere just to freak out navigators....

A couple of thoughts tumble forth from my recolletions of days long ago:

1. A fellow High Passage writer once asked Marc Miller about
taxes once when we were at a convention. He wanted an idea of 
how such a system would work and how to incorporate it into the
game if it would make a difference in some gaming situations.
Marc grimmaced, made various gurgling noises, sat silently for a
few seconds, and then finally suggested that we foget the whole
thing as it would be a lot of work to figure out such a system and
it would only add marginal things to the game. He stated that for 
official purposes, we should consider taxes factored into the game
system.


2. Re: taxes and Trillion Credit Squadron: There is also a taxes
system in good old Striker, and the two are very, very different.
I remember computing a budget for a medium sized world using the
Striker system (or was it TCS?) and computing that the world would
be able to build and maintain several hundred Tigress class 500,000
ton dreadnoughts per year. This discovery was very humorous, as
we were designing the Old Expanses Fleet at the time. We figured
that using the official rules we could easily build a fleet that
could take the rest of the Imperium by force with no trouble.
Mr. Miller was not amused by the fact that the design rules made
this possible, and told us to more or les ignore the system.

1600 LIGHT-YEARS, DAMMIT! LIGHT-YEARS! NOT MILES! Jeesh....

And on Dan\'s argument that we could have black holes or neutron stars in
every sector, but we couldn\'t see them if they weren\'t companions of bright
astral bodies (like, say, Nina Hartley\'s |-> ), I\'m afraid that that argument
falls apart at densities like those he suggests. The black holes about which
we know (or claim to know) are very far away from us, and can only be seen by
their Xray emissions, but if we had a black hole within our back yard (i.e.
within 25 parsecs, the radius of our sector, approx), we\'d sure as hell know
it. Black holes cause vicious gravitational lensing; as they move across the
sky, they\'d cause the light of stars that they occulted to move in response
to their gravity wells. If any sort of concerted effort were made to chart 
star movements within a sector, it would take very little time (in historical
terms, that is) to spot the effects of a black hole in a sector; and at one-
per-subsector densities, things get even worse.

I was curious how many people run games in habitats and what they think of
the scenarios they use.  My game world relies on them a great deal because
I assume that once people learn to space-industrialize, they won\'t go 
back.  Thus, the average population of a solar system in my game world
is about four hundred billion.  If people live on planets (terraformed
Earth-like ones, that is), which only happens in about one system in ten,
such a population is about one percent of the total population of the system.

Habitats in my world tend to be clustered around large asteroids (100 km. +)
or the giant moons of gas giants.  Why?  Lots of natural resources close by.
(A 100 km. asteroid has enough material in it to build hundreds or thousands
or habitats, even assuming a low metal/organic/other useful stuff-to-slag
ratio; giant moons give you even more, even if they\'re mostly ice there will
be organics to make plastics from, etc.)

My basic large habitat is a rotating cylinder 15 km. across the base and
60 km. long.  In addition to the landscaped interior, which I call a "dayside"
because it sounds like something people might call such a place, I assume
that the ends of the cylinder are solid complexes.  Actually, they\'re like
the ring-type space stations you see in 2001, only on a much bigger scale.
Assuming an average ceiling height of 10 m.--the idea is to make these things
non-claustrophobic since a lot of people live on some of the levels--you have
room for about 700 levels.  If the complexes are 100 m. wide the effect
is something like having 700 shopping malls (only most of them are offices,
neighborhoods with townhouses, etc.) stacked on top of each other, and the
two complexes give you about 3600 square km.  Add this to the 1200 square
km. you get from the dayside, and the habitat (which I assume as having a
population of roughly one million) has a total of nearly 5000 square km.
of surface area.  The dayside is used for farms, parks, etc., and the
endwall complexes have apartment levels, business levels, factories,
warehouses, etc.  This leaves us with a population density similar to
that of Great Britain or New England.  Plenty of room for everyone.  
(After all, what\'s the point of technologically advanced if you have
to live packed together like rats in a barrel?)

Running these environments is not hard.  The endwall complexes are just
like city streets, except that they are a lot cleaner, there are no cars,
and the subways (stations every half-kilometer or so) are big elevators
that either stop at every level, every ten levels, or every hundred levels
(I think this is how they run elevators in large buildings like the Trade
Center; at any rate, I\'m sure this is a problem anyone with a degree in
city planning could solve in about five minutes, although it might take
longer to work out all the details.)  The daysides are pretty much 
outdoor environments, except you cannot use Field Artillery (people take
a VERY dim view of someone blowing a hole in the side of their world).
By the way, I assume the hulls of these things are several meters thick,
both for structural strength and radiation shielding, and about half of
that is good ol\' topsoil, so you can have reasonably large trees in 
these habitats, and hills (small ones), and lakes, and so on.

Well, I\'ll stop here...I could easily ramble on about these things for
much longer.  Anyone have any comments?  ideas?  suggestions?

I would suggest sculpting your dayside to provide for the hills and lakes.
That way you don\'t have large areas of wasted topsoil.  The soil is a
uniform thickness throughout and the elevation is provided by sculpting the
hull.  

How about chaining habitats like a necklace when population pressures get
too large?  How long could a habitat run without supervision?  What about
"abandoned" structures?  Can they be moved, or can they only be created on
the spot?  If they can be moved is there a market in habitats orbiting
mined out asteroids?  Boy you could have a lot of adventures based on these
things:-)

Oops...Yes I had forgotten about the light-bending properties of blackholes,
and with a spaceship that can move over a wide area, it is quite probable

Yes I agree, however I was not discussing changing the star generation process
(which I would have left on the star generation list), rather coming up 
with a reason for the generation as listed. I did want a sub table to
generate other stellar phenomanon used perhaps once or twice per sector.
The rules (scouts) even mention adding supergiants in at a very low density
(1 per sector or so).

My main points are/were:
1) Stars not represented correctly (2D, too many non-dwarf, no black holes...)
a) Assume all stars are projected into a plane. to get 2D board
b) a large number of stars are not mapped (usualy dwarfs) because of no
bodies in the system for bases/fuel.
c) Resultant stars provide density and composition we get from the star
generation tables. (I have a good reason for 2D as well which I haven\'t
brought up).
d) Add in other interesting stellar objects at a rate of a few per sector
(I like a lot of black holes myself...but see first paragraph).
e) this results in no changes to the maps (execpt where you want to mark
other stellar objects), nor to any rules, it is just a method of
perceiving the traveller universe so that it approximates ours more closely
(after all we have already assumed a 2D universe)

2) Obervation techniques don\'t seem to match today\'s standards.
a) Correct me if I\'m wrong as I havn\'t dug up my Zhodani alien module, but
I believe that in the core exploration rules, you only get to see an
area 2-3 parsecs ahead of you. 
b) if you subscribe to (1) above, identifying good stars may that difficult.
c) if not, (I was probably exaggerating when I said we could see the entire
imperium from one location.) but even the near star map at 50 ly radius
represents a circle with a 30 parsec diameter, which is approximately a sector
(24x40 parsecs). That is with tech 8 ground based telescopes, a good TL 15
scout in space with no light noise sould get at least 4 sectors. (double range)
d) additionaly as an jump-capable observer can more easily calulate positions
by virtue of being able to observe from different points (from Leonard)

	-Dan
	
BTW I haven\'t received any mail (dan@engrg.uwo.ca) complaining, so I will
continue this discussion on the list.

>How long could a habitat run without supervision?

A quick guess would be that when they first starting to appear(technically
feasable)  I would say, that they need LOTS of supervision, while as they
are used more in the higher tech levels, they would need very little super
vision in themselves(like the Azun structures in JTAS #15 I think).  But
the supervision is more for security to keep sabotage to a minimium.  So
if noone sabotaged the structure or systems, a tech 15 Habitat I would
think, could conceivable run for years with no outside help.  Though it
would have to be designed from the start to be fairly self sustaining.

>What about "abandoned" structures?

I would say lots if you are using the shattered IMperium rules.  Afterall,
they can make very good targets.

>Can they be moved, or can they only be created on the spot?

The smaller ones probly can be moved by a ship similar to the bulk cargo
carrior in Fighting Ships.  Who knows, someone may have designed a ship
to do it.  Why, I don\'t know, it would be cheaper to take it apart and reuse
the parts elsewhere, transported by a smaller (and cheaper) ship.

>Boy you could have a lot of adventures based on these things:-)

A viably untaped resource for adventures.  You can have all sorts of
environments, Water, desert, ice, vaccume(why I don\'t know) and then
some.

Actually, at distances of parsecs, the light bending properties of black
holes are not significantly different from those of ordinary stars of the
same mass.  I won\'t bother you (unless provoked!) with the math, but the
point is that the Einstein ring diameter (=characteristic scale of lensing
phenomena) is far larger than the stellar radius so that it makes very
little difference whether the mass is concentrated within its
Schwarzschild radius or merely within a normal stellar radius.  The
differences get more impressive if you get close (say within about 0.01 pc).

On the general topic of stellar exotica in Traveller, one should not
overlook degenerate (white) dwarf stars which are certainly common enough
to appear in great numbers within the Imperium.  Although much less
exotic than neutron stars and black holes, their large surface gravities
and tendancy to produce enormous explosions (novae) when provided with a
bit of hydrogen fuel might allow for some interesting adventures.  BTW,
such stars often occur in binary systems which would allow for an
ordinary star supporting habitable planets in the near vicinity of a
degenerate dwarf.

Regarding some of the questions on habitats...

Most of the habitats in my game world (I don\'t really rely on Tech Levels
all that much, except as a reference for when certain tech items show up;
everyone is pretty much at the same very high level of technology) can
run on their own for a while.  Eventually, the environment will break 
down, but these things come with a series of very smart environmental
computers and a lot of tech robots to help the environmental engineers
keep things going.  If everyone suddenly died, the habitat would keep
running itself for a while.

As for moving them, why not?  If the habitat is using fusion and matter-
antimatter power, you won\'t disturb the power source by moving it (as you
might with a solar-based power system); if you boost the thing at a very
low degree of thrust and build it up slowly, you could eventually make
the thing an oversized spacecraft.  The internal gravity will not be
disturbed that much, even on rotating habitats, if the thrust from external
engines is only, say, 1/1000th of a gravity.  (or 1/10000th.)  Sure, it
will take years to get anywhere, but you have a habitat, so what\'s the hurry?

Abandoned habitats?  Not very many of them.  Habitats are very expensive;
even the raw materials used to build them are quite valuable.  If a habitat
has been somehow rendered uninhabitable (terrorists, plague, war, etc.) or
if it has simply broken down over time, and it takes time, I assume a high
technology habitat can probably last a million years or more if properly
maintained, the raw materials will quickly be recycled for something else.
Someone will claim it; people will probably fight over that much refined
material!  (Good source for adventures--salvage wars!)  The only place I
think you would find them would be underpopulated systems or the cometary
halo (i.e., isolated areas where there is not enough a population base to
handle the industrial problems involved in recycling that big a hulk.)

Well, go go now.  Take care.

I have been trying for a long time to develop a realistic combat system
for Traveller.  As some of you may have figured out by now, the good people
at GDW often have some very good ideas, but just as often have no f**king
clue what they\'re doing.

In part, they\'re hampered by the basic problem of game design: the more
realistic you make a game, the less playable it is.  Even so, some of
what they have come up with for combat is either implausible or just
flat wrong.

I would be interested in hearing how the people on the mailing list have
reacted to the various combat systems created by GDW, and the modifications
they have come up with to deal with aspects they did not like.

For a start, I have had to develop my own damage system--based not on
statistics, for the most part, but on (a) location of hit on a person\'s
body and (b) the actual damage caused by the weapon.  In addition, I
think some weapons have been treated very poorly in terms of how effective
they are.  Many primitive weapons are much more dangerous (bows, especially)
than the GDW tables would have you think.

Disclaimer: I have not looked at the original GDW books in a while, so when
it comes to particulars, I have to cite from memory.  Please correct me
if I am wrong about any specific weapons, etc.  (I have a feeling that 
for the most part, however, people will agree that GDW combat systems leave
something to be desired.)

Bob asked if I have any back issues of Traveller\'s Digest for
article copying purposes. I do, and I thought others might be 
interested. I have issues 1,2, and 7, and 9+. Issue 2 has
a couple of pages that were\'t printed (part of the adventure),
so I\'d be interested in getting copies of those if anyone\'s
got the issue. I\'d be happy to copy articles if anyone wants
\'em. I\'ve also got numerous (read hundreds) of High Passage
back issues 2-5 in my parent\'s garage. I knew I couldn\'t sell
then when FASA and I went our seperate ways but I was not
going to let them keep them even if I had to trash them myself.
Anyway, if you\'re interested, drop me a line.

I have a friend who uses a modified Azhanti High Lightning systeem, with 
penetration and such. It is rather easy to run. If he can dig it up I will 
post it, besides I haven\'t talked to him in about three months, both to busy
and it will give me a good excuse to give him a call.

My apologies for garbling the last message. Apparently there
was a problem with the system not recognizing some of the
editing functions I used or something like that. This was done
out of ignorance-- I am but a humble library science student
and graduate assistant specializing in arms control and know
little of these computer thingies. The most sophisticated I get
is using my Apple II (I can hear you all laughing all the way up
here) and struggling with the occasional problem with various
CD ROM data bases at work.

Anyway, I had mentioned that at least one of you out there
was interested in articles from old issues of Traveller\'s
Digest. I have issues 1-2, 7, and 9+. I\'ll be happy to 
copy articles for you. In addition, I have several hundred
copies, and in two cases thousands of issues of High Passage
2-5. If anyone wants any of this stuff, drop me a byte.

In addition, my copy of TD 1 had a printing error-- pages
18 and 33 were not printed. Anyone out there with a copy
that they can xerox for me?

Greetings,

     Things are slowly getting back to normal out here in the Bay
Area.  A different form of normal, perhaps, than prevailed nine
days ago, but normal nonetheless.
     So far, my informal poll shows that the entire population of
Silicon Valley was on an editor at 5:04 last Tuesday.  About half
of them made a frantic effort to save their files and before they
took cover.  There\'s a lesson here about the the effects of training
and force of habit.  There\'s also a lesson about different forms of
reality.  One envisions a hapless starcrew frantically consulting a
manual as his vessel disintigrates around him:  "No, wait!  I did 
not mean to dodge into the flightpath of that missile!  Perhaps I
can recall an earlier version of my files in which the ship has not 
yet been destroyed!"

     The large-scale structural test which we conducted on our 
buildings last week raises an interesting question?  How many of
you folk incorporate random large-scale disasters in your game?
What form do these disasters take?  Galactic core explosions?
Supernovae?  Asteroid impacts?  Earthquakes?  Perhaps even local
school board elections?  What are the effects of these disasters?
On the hapless player characters?  On the unsung cast of millions
(or billions) of NPCs who suffer and die to provide the necessary
background?  Is it possible for player characters to influence the
course of events?  Do they?  For good or for ill?
     The last such event I recall in The Eight Worlds was the Great 
Allanlok Spaceport Fire.  This was an entirely accidental event for
which the PCs actually bore some responsibility:
     A vessel they were escorting lost power on liftoff from Mor,
the major (in fact the only) city on Allanlok.  The hapless pilot
lost control and crashed.  A random roll for location placed the
crash site in the middle of the spaceport fuel depot which, alas,
lacked the sophisticated safety devices such as might be found on
a more advanced world.  The liguid hydrogen tanks storage ruptured, 
vented their contents, and exploded one by one in a cataclysmic chain
reaction.  The resulting fires spread through the warehouse district
and the surrounding slums and shanties to reach the city itself.  
     The fires raged for three days.  One third of the city was 
destroyed.  More than 20,000 people lost thier lives.
     The PCs were extremely active in the relief effort.  They helped
to evacuate the city, they helped to build firebreaks, and they flew 
water-bombing missions.  Several PCs lost their lives, including three 
engineers who were aboard the doomed merchant ship (they knew the ship
had problems with its drives so they came on board to help with the 
liftoff, hence the responsibilty) when it performed its fatal
demonstration of Newtonian mechanics.

     Disasters provide an excellent (if somewhat macabre) source of
scenarios.  Consider the following example:
     The Imperial Naval Station on Decus VII receives word that the 
entire planet of Vanderleigh suffered a local school board election.  
The Imperial task force is not available:  Every ship is out of 
commision (excuse me... the ships are at Readiness Level Charlie) until 
necessary repairs can be conducted on their tomato peelers.  Vanderleigh 
is on its own... unless... a free trader can be pressed into service.  
As fate and the GM would have it, the only suitable vessel belongs to a 
set of player characters.  Over their protests, they are comissioned as 
members of the Imperial Auxiliary Transport Reserve and forced to fly a 
relief mission.  They have many adventures, humor, drama, and pathos 
abound, but last they are all consumed by local politics and die.  The 
players all abandon the game in anger.  Alone, forlorn, friendless, the 
luckless GM decides upon a scheme of world conquest.  He draws upon his 
expertise as a TRAVELLER GM to build a working time transport which he 
uses to travel to Post WWII Japan.  Working behind the scenes, he 
rebuilds the shattered nation into a major world economic power under 
his hidden but absolute control.  Soon he will be ready to implement 
the second phase of his sinister plan.  The only threat to his scheme 
for world domination come from a brave space physicist who attempts to 
conceal a warning in a humorous message regarding Role Playing Games.  
But before he can finish this warning he is bgjhvk;rqenblbl............

I had to respond to this article.  First let me say that I think that GDW
on the whole has produced some of the best combat gaming systems ever done.
For example: the Citadel, Avalanche, Crusader, Striker, Command Decision, 
Twilight 2000 and First Battles games all have very good combat systems.
So I think that I have to disagree with Mark on most of what he states in
his article.  But what constitutes a good system to me probably doesn\'t
touch base with Mark.  I prefer systems that emphasize the command side
of combat to the technological, it sounds like Mark prefers the opposite:
>For a start, I have had to develop my own damage system--based not on
>statistics, for the most part, but on (a) location of hit on a person\'s
>body and (b) the actual damage caused by the weapon.
Realism is subjective and most gamers seem to feel a system is realistic
only when they can be a Field Marshall and a Private in the same game.
(Well maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration, but hopefully you\'ll get my
drift).  There is also a problem (as you said) with encumbrance, the more
detailed you get with a set of rules the less playable it is.  For example,
TAC Force is an extremely realistic modern armor system, but it is
practically unplayable due to the detail i.e. a minimum of an hour to work
out a minute game time.  Given that a typical modern action lasts 15 to 20
minutes...  However, the game is very worthwhile as a reference.  If you
want to work out individual damage then you have will be limiting the size
of your games to probably the squad level.  Which may work fine for the
kind of campaign your running, but a publisher can\'t tailor their rules to
your situations only you can do that.

As for GDW specifically I have great respect for Frank Chadwick\'s work and less
for Mark Millers.  This is mainly due to the fact that Frank spends more time
tuning his systems by running them past outside playtesters.  He seems more open
to other peoples opinions and more in touch with his audience.

As for weapons ratings this is always subjective, and as for bows specifically
I believe the bow in the rules is meant to be the normal primitive short
bow.  I think stats were given in one of the JTAS for long bows and
composite bows.  We did quite a bit of low tech striker and that rating
works out correctly.  Why do you think everyone in the world threw these away
for smoothbore muskets which have an accuracy when shooting at a man of 30 feet?
With most bows large die mods should be needed to use them at all effectively.
Modern Hunting bows may be a different matter and if that is where you have
experience add an appropriate rule for it.

I don\'t think anyone has ever not had to make provisions in a game for what he
feels is the right balance.  The rules for Traveller are not meant to be a
Bible, only to be a guide or a base from which to start.  We constantly made
up new skills while playing Traveller.  I redesigned the computers when I ran
Traveller games, because I know about computers, they don\'t.  Their rules were
OK for most people, but since I have specific knowledge I expanded the rules
till I felt comfortable.  Even Frank Chadwick frequently makes up new rules
as we go along.  For example last winter we began running a Korean War
scenario for Command Decision called East of Chosen.  We were faced with
the problems of human wave assaults for the first time.  So we made up
rules that fit.  Now I don\'t know what Mark feels is improbable or wrong,
but I don\'t see how he can say they have no clue about what they\'re doing.
Especially since he offered us no reason to believe that he does.  If you
don\'t like a combat system and want to make up a new one that fits what you
feel is the way to go, so what?  This doesn\'t mean the old system is wrong,
it\'s not a black and white situation.  Especially since this is science fiction
and who really knows how it works or even if it could ever work.  If you don\'t
like the abstract damage system for wounds, then design your own.  There are
plenty of guides out there.  Twilight 2000 has a rating based on limbs, torso
and head.  There is even a game called Bio 1 which works out for bullets
what got hit and how much the character bleeds.

Mark:

I\'ve used the GDW combat system for over ten years, and I agree that it has
a lot of gaps where combat realism is concerned. However, there are two 
considerations that override a greater attention to realism: first is the
up side that playability at the cost of realism makes gaming more fun in the
long run for groups that are more interested in role-playing than in realistic
combat per se, and second is the down side that a truly realistic combat system
involving anything more dangerous than paint pellet pistols would be gory,
painfully short, and no fun at all for anyone who cared about their characters.
This is the fundamental difficulty of RPGs involving combat; if they\'re at all
realistic, they may still be playable but they WON\'T be fun. (I cite the game
of PHOENIX COMMAND by Leading Edge as a shining example of this; on average,
you lose your character on the first hit.)

I think the MegaTraveller combat system is a huge improvement over this, as it
deliberately breaks combat into two parts: the first, combat itself, deals in
broad strokes, dealing generalized damage and trauma that either knocks you 
out, kills you, or not. Then, after the fighting\'s over and the medics can get
to you, the extent and form of the damage is assessed. The Traveller\'s Digest
has a nifty article on what happens next (prostheses, cloning new body parts,
bionics, etc.). It\'s in Issue 13, I believe: the Terra issue. I\'m not a realism
freak: Barry Nakazono broke me of that habit five years ago at a PHOENIX
COMMAND playtest. My parties avoid combat for all of the right reasons, and 
because the people in my game aren\'t in it for the combat anyway. 

If you insist on realism in the MegaTrav system, the Travellers\' Digest 
articles are vital; the rules, as they are, won\'t tell you how to reassemble
a character who\'s been turned into taco filling. (Also, it provides a very 
clear, consistent, and time-efficient means of determining exactly what 
happens to a character who blows a survival roll during career generation, 
that improves upon "he has to muster out now" and really beats "oh dear, he\'s
dead, start over." Has anybody noticed that Scouts would have a 50% attrition
rate per year otherwise? The Navy and Marines have it easy!)

Good luck on your search for the ultimate in realistic combat systems: if you
find it, let me know, but I don\'t think it\'s worth searching for in my own
games.

Ooops, missed the subject line...

Well, I\'m glad that my comments on the combat system gathered responses,
even if they were negative.  Actually, that\'s probably my fault; I did 
come on a little strong.  (I must have been in a particularly bad mood.
My apologies.)

I thought I should add a little more to give people a better idea.  Basically,
the thing I object to is that, assuming the average character has 18 to 25
hit points, a single round from a pistol, and even from most rifles or shot-
guns, is not likely to do more than "wow, I\'ve lost some hit points; gee,
maybe I shouldn\'t charge so many machinegun nests."

I am VERY aware of the reality-playability problem; one of my goals has been
to design a combat system that has as much of both as possible.  (I think
my bad mood was a result of some of the sacrifices I have had to make as far
as reality is concerned in order to manage the playability.  Of course,
ultimately, the playability is the primary concern.)

Suffice that now, if you shot or stabbed with anyone bigger than a 6 mm.
pistol (like a .25, but with actual killing power) or a boot knife, you can
be in serious trouble.  Just like real life.  Even the little weapons can
kill on a lucky shot.  Shotguns and rifles?  These were weapons designed
for (a) killing large animals like bears and (b) overkill on medium-sized
animals like humans.

On the up side, armor (kevlar, etc.) is fairly cheap in my gameworld.  And
it will stop most small arms, or at least reduce a killing wound to a bruise
(and maybe a broken rib).  Also, hospitals in the future may still be run by
incompetent humans, but they have much better machines.  I\'m a trained first
aider, so I consider "death" as "when your heart stops and your brain
starts to die from oxygen lack."  If someone dies and you get them to a
support unit in the first five or ten minutes, they will recover with no
problem.  (Hell, we can do that NOW.)  Also, just like in real life, if
you have a trained medic in the party, most wounds that would be fatal 
without medical attention can be treated to the point where they are no
longer life-threatening.  The character will have to go to the hospital
to finish patching things up, but they will live.  My basic rule of thumb
is that serious wounds without medical attention can kill up to 90% of
the time, but WITH medical attention, only kill about 10% of the time.
(By the way, it takes a long time to bleed to death unless you have been
hit in the aorta or femoral artery, so medics usually have plenty of time
to crawl over and work on people.)

Medical stuff...please use these ideas if you like them...Medical drug
slows bleeding (or stops it if it is minor) so medics have more time to
get to you; it also prevents shock.  Also, portable cranial support units
("brain boxes") are available to keep a brain alive when the body can\'t
do it anymore.  True, you have to wait for donor body to show up, but
at least you\'re alive.

Last but not least, and perhaps most interesting to you people, I hope,
is how all this affects the gaming.  There is a really interesting effect
when players know that violence is bad for their health...they think a lot
more.  The unspoken rules in my gameworld, one of the lessons I try to
teach, is that shooting and stabbing people are not really desirable things
(although they may sometimes be necessary).  Killing is dangerous, messy,
unpleasant, and even if you get out of the firefight, there can be legal
reprecussions.  (Often, these are more horrifying than the firefight, 
as anyone who has dealt with lawyers can tell you.)  So, I want people to
THINK before they get into a firefight.  And if they choose to do so,
they should THINK about how to get the first shot off (the second unspoken
rule is that if you have to kill someone, do it right).  

By the way, I don\'t run my world with the intention to slaughter my player
characters.  My gameworld is dangerous, but if you use common sense, even
in "commando" scenarios where you know there will be a lot of shooting
(NPCs are usually people with skills at the nominal level, and most of 
them are of only average intelligence and physical abilities), you have
an excellent chance of coming out without a scratch.

Well, I\'ve rambled on far too long.  Take care, all; I look forward to
further discussions.

    Mark

	From several of the traveller campaigns I\'ve seen, if you\'re talking
about firearms, control is non-existent! :-)  On the other hand, the No-Nukes
laws seem very firmly in place... even in the campaign I\'m in now, in which the
players are caught between two power forces - two contenders for the imperial
throne.  On the other hand (hey, this is traveller, we can have three handed
aliens...) the fighting hasn\'t gotten truly intense yet, and the players are
avoiding the whole mess (or trying to) so we may never know.

>It seems to be working with the Zhodani, but because *they*
>don\'t care - humaniti is still hesitant.  It seems to be
>a cosmic [sic] failure near Capital.

	What do you mean, "they don\'t care?"  I\'m running a Zhodani character
right now, (and doing it accurately, I think) and while "we" aren\'t too worried
about the internal power struggles of you imperials, that\'s dependent upon just
that point - internal.  On the other hand, I have the feeling the Consulate 
would have strong interests if the fighting spilled over, accidentally or on
purpose, into Zhodani space.  

>Maybe Mr. Cunnignham (I sure hope I got it right) can share
>some thoughts on arms control, and why people in the fture
>are no more philospohically advanced than we.

	I\'d be interested in Mr. Cunningham\'s thoughts also, but I have the
only answer that counts for your last point - if the people in the future were
more philosophically advanced than we are, nobody would be playing Traveller.
After all, why are we doing this?  For fun!  And let\'s face it, a world where
everything is perfect isn\'t much fun to role-play in.  Most campaigns are based
on conflict, between the players and other forces.  Remove the conflict, and
you remove the basis for the campaign.

	Besides which, I\'m not so sure that simply being further along the
time-line must mean that they are more philosophically advanced.  Granted, our
civilization is in many ways nicer than civilization a few hundred years ago 
(for example, nicer about children & old folks, about racial equality, etc) but
is this necessarily a factor of how much time w\'ve had for philsophical
advancement, or couldn\'t it simply be a factor of convenience - most cultures
weren\'t too attached to young kids because it was too likely they\'d die young.
As medicine and living conditions have improved, the death rate has decreased,
and parents become more attached to their kids, etc.

I agree with Adrian, that most people (in a game) don\'t care exactly
where they get hit, however I do find that a hit location system important
to some characters.

(e.g. The Sternmetal villain reaches for the alarm button, Susan shoots with
her snub pistol...(roll, roll)...and wounds the director, who proceeds to 
press the button anyway)

This type of situation calls for a method of hit location, either as an
"I aim for the director\'s hand" or "He\'s not hit criticaly, where do you 
hit?...(roll)...you hit his arm, the button is not pressed!"

However, you wouldn\'t need it every time. Quite often in a games that has
hit location, I ignore it unless it is important at that time.

As far as arms control in the Traveller universe goes, I don\'t recall
anyone ever presenting anything along those lines. The closest thing
I can remember is that there are demilitarized zones between the
Imperium and the Zhodani. The Fifth Frontier War began for the
Imperium with the shocking news that a Zhodani fleet was present
at Ruie/Regina, and to get there said fleet would have violated the
zone. See the news reports from Journal 9, which were also reprinted
in a later issue (about 17ish) and in the rules manual of the Fifth
Frontier War board game.

Arms control could certainly be an interesting topic to explore.
Thinking about it, I see a major problem: verification would be
impossible, just as it was in the major naval treaties in the
1920s. In fact, it is only with the advancement of recon satellites
that any form of verification is possible here and now at all, and
even this is not perfect-- nuclear warheads are easy to hide, and
there is no way to peek into the warhead buses of missiles (which 
aren\'t as easy to hide) to see how many warheads are actually in 
there (you have to guess).

I see some interesting adventuring possibilities here. A team
of adventurers could be hired to investigate the faith of a
nation or world (independent by position or because of the
Rebellion) which has a treaty with its neighbor. All kinds of
neat spy stuff.

I\'ll probably come up with some more ideas in the months ahead,
as I\'ll be finishing my library degree in December and starting
my second masters (real world? Hah! Forget it!) in political science
specializing in arms control. Right now I work in the library here
at U of I which houses the Arms Control Collection. Pays the rent.


As far as HP back issues goes, all I need is $1 each to cover
postage. I\'ve got a few copies of each issue here with me; if
I run out I\'ll have to get some next time I visit my folks.
They\'ll be happy-- the boxes of issues are piled up in the garage,
and I refuse to part with them. Please note that I\'ll need your
"real" address to send you anything. My "real" address is:

About a year ago I remade the MegaT combatsystem with the Twilight system
as an pattern. I\'ll try to dig it up somtime after the exams are done.

Very shortly it went like this:
To hit is, like before, a task and the difficulties per range are the same
with one exeption: All long weapons have Difficult on Short range.
(Try handling a rifle when wrestling!) Also, to separate the weapons alittle,
they had extra positive DM\'s on some ranges for some weapons
(Actually more simple than it sounds)
When you hit someone (or somebeing B-) the damage done was random. (ie: 4D
was "Toss 4 dice" and not "4 woundpoints") The damage the person sustained
was what was left when you subtracted what the armor absorbed.
There were also hit locations with capacities based on the UPP of the target.

This system worked quite well for small-scale combat, < 10 participants
on each side and not too many Autofire weapons with Dangerspace.

I disagree. I have difficulty following the "real" system generator,(RSG)
plus how do we put in the data for the major planet? I was thinking of the
opposite use MegaTraveller (and WBH) then add elements from the RSG or other
systems to make it a unique product.

Yes but we need some discussion to get the right prototype to start with.

I like the idea of using 3D space, but haven\'t been able to figure out how
to create maps that are both interesting and readable.  I don\'t think that
Jump-1 ships would be affected too much, since the mean separation of stars
would not be changed.

Subject: Discussion group membership and programming workload 
Currently, the discussion group has a membership of 12 people,
not all of whom are Computer Science/programmer types (not at      
least from what I understand). First we need to determine how       
many people in the group have programming skills (software
engineering, structured design, etc) -- just to get things
going. Then we can approach this in several ways:

   1) Pick one of the programmers as lead (perhaps a co-lead also),
      and have those individuals come up with a preliminary design
      and then discuss the design with the list and then make coding
      assignments to the remaining programmers. Those who are not
      programmers will be the test/evaluation group and will be
      responsible for making sure that the progam does everything      
      it is supposed to, and also try their hardest to get the
      program to crash (we can\'t turn out a bad system ;-).

   2) A more "free-for-all" approach (everybody does everything).
      Everybody does the prelim design, evaluates each others    
      work to get rge final design. Then, everybody codes a
      part.

There may be other options, but over the internet, I don\'t think
we can refine it much. Opinions?

I am in favor of #1 -- but those involved in the preliminary design
(everybody evaluates that to get the final design) must communicate.
Once they have a preliminary design, the discussion group evaluates     
that and either rejects it, approves it, or can make changes to get      
what they want. Once we have a final design, we can mix and match
people with modules to code (according to what they want to do, ability,
etc). This is the best way to ensure a modular system.

Now this will obviously have to be adjusted. Not all the programmers
may have the time to program, and I\' sure there are those who don\'t
program as a profession but would love to work on the prelim design or
code on this system. Some people have sent email about their \'areas of expertise\'
and I would like to have everybody post and design/coding experience just
so we know what we have the capabilities of doing.

Subject: Gensec, Mapsub and more ramblings
To: sysgen-group

Now that I have had a chance to look at Gensec and Mapsub, I think they could
be a good basis for future work. I particuarily like the postscript
output on the mapsub program.

The data I would like to see is as follows:
Size	     Data			Map
1. Grand     None at this level		Contour Map of stars highlighting
	     (Info taken from level 2)	rift regions.
2. Sector    Star Locations, High	Tiny squares with dots for stars (name
	     population worlds		of high pop. planet?) (As in atlas of
	     indicated			the imperium)
3. Subsector Standard gensec output	As mapgen, perhaps with stats on left
					side as in "Spinward marches"
4. Solar     All planets basic info	(No real precidence.perhaps a landscape
	     Stars\' info.		page with a scale of the system at the
					top, and some details of the planets
E.G:
System:O-.-.--.----.----%----o----o----o----o----.
Zone:       I      O
Moons:   - -  1   2    -    24          16            9          3           -
etc.
5. Planetary Detailed info such as	Standard squashed dodecahedron, with
	     temperature, tilt etc.	major cities, roads etc. marked.
6. Regional  ?Unknown?			One "triangle" from planet map, more
					cities, terrain marked.
7. Local     ?Unknown?			City map, jungle map, etc. I have
					doubts about this one still.

As far a I can see, we will have to split the data file at some point, as all
the data would fill up too much space, and obscure the basics when the file
was editied. Perhaps if each system could be located exactly, a sorted database
could be maintained seperatley for the systems done in detail. Locating a
system in detail would only require identifying the sector somehow, as the
location in the sector is already present. If memory serves me there are only
about 140 sectors described (not all in the same detail) in the official 
Traveller/Megatraveller Universe. I hate to use the Imperial reference point
as the origin of the coordinate system. The Zho\'s would probably want to use
the center of the galixy as the origin, but that would probably result in
sector numbers being too large. (quick what\'s the radius of the galixy
divided by 10 parsecs?) Any ideas on what to use?

1 Which version of Traveller

	I think we should use MegaTraveller. Mainly because Traveller is now
consider outdated. And really for this program to be useful, MegaTraveller 
seems to make more sense.

2 Grand Survey
	
	Well, I don\'t think Grand Survey for MT is out yet, but we should
use World Builder\'s Handbook. DGP\'s stuff is official as far as both GDW and
everyone else concerns. No reason why we shouldn\'t use it.

3 what type

create a huge program that covers all aspect of it.

I go for MT too.  In the star system area, there are not great
quantities of differences that former Traveller players would complain
about.

I think the entire thing should be written for (Mega)TRAVELLER, not so
general-purpose that it makes life hard for referees who have to convert
from super-realistic real-world modeling into game terms.  In
otherwords, I think we should use published game forms and symbols
for our output formats, wherever possible.  This means I\'d like to use
procedures adapted from the World Builder\'s Handbook and the MT Referee\'s
Manual.

I want to consider a modular program approach (okay, so I\'m a UNIX
wizard and it shows).  Maybe a set of filters that take the input and
randomly/user-guidedly generate additional information.

I am doig my first project in C++, having become fairly whizzy at C over
the last few years, and would enjoy using C++ instead of C.  But, I
wouldn\'t chafe at using plain old C.

I have a broad knowledge of Astronomy and Astrophysics.  It\'s not really
deep, but is about as deep as a Upper Division 6-month course in
Astronomy/Astrophysics would be at a major University.  I was at the top
of my 1-year course in Classical Physics w/Calculus at my University.  I
play with Simulation of Physical systems on the computer.  I am somewhat
familiar (broad but not deep) about planetary geology (or whatever you
call what we learn from Mariner, Pioneer and Voyager).  I have some
familiarity with Biochemistry and Biology, broad but not deep at all.  I
love all knowledge, and tend to be a generalist.  I read Scientific
American cover-to-cover, but tend to skim on biochemistry and
anthropology.

I have a BSCS and much experience in programming on Unix systems.  I am
one of the handful the power-users and wizards in my engineering group
of about 50 people where I work.  I am a computer and science nerd.

Yes, it does seem to be the thing everyone does first when they come to
Traveller.  I remember spending many hours rolling dice coming up with
my first subsector in about 1980.  There are a lot of systems in a
subsector.  You have some useful suggestions for the people on the Star
System Digest group.

As for generating minor bodies in a stellar system, well, I would tend
to think you\'d be rather overwhelmed by detail.  Still, it wouldn\'t be
unreasonable to list the major planetoids in a system and map out the
Trojan points 60 degrees before and after large gas giant planets.  Any
system will have planetoids of some kind.

The orbital map would be easy; it would be simple to derive interesting
orbits where satellites would be likely to be concentrated.  For economy
reasons, most satellites live in low planetary orbit, whereas those that
need to hover over the same point in space by definition must be boosted
to Geosynch.

World/Satellite maps, both physical and political, have always been a
fascinating topic to me, and undoubtedly it is a very complicated one.
A real simulation designer\'s nightmare.  But it sounds like fun
research.  My previous exposure to this sort of idea was in generating a
map of terrain, simulated by volcanoes, then raining on it and letting
the water drain to locate rivers and lakes.  I met with mixed success.

Generating Life forms should be possible using clever randomized tables.
One could come up with a list of general attributes the larger popular
creatures on the planet have (like on earth, they have hair and four
legs, etc.), the vary it to generate different creatures.  The tables
and mechanism for doing this would be probably be good material for
submission to the Traveller\'s Digest, too.

What is a "net list";  Is it a listing describing the attributes of each
object/hex printed on the map?  If it is, this sounds valuable:

Player: "what do we get when we scan this hex by the ocean?"

Ref: "Hex 2109 on the planet map, let\'s look it up.  Uh-huh.  Sensors
reveal a major city with a metropolitan/suburb area of 12km x 15km in
size, a major river passing through on its way to the ocean, and a class
F Spaceport.  Library data indicates that this city has a population of
1.4 million inhabitants, and is called Port City."

Like I said before, I lean toward developing output forms that are
recognized for their similarity to existing forms published by GDW and
Digest Group.

James;

We\'re in complete agreement about maps needing to match the needs
of the users AND be somewhat compatible with what has gone before.

Your idea is better than a net list (complete concordance of what 
is in each hex on the map).  A net list is an idea from CAD programs
that tells which pins on which chip are connected together, and
sometimes some limited information about those chips.

My original thought went something more like what you said, though.

This would enable the party (or each player) to have a map with 
"player" information, the GM to have a similar one and a complete
description with confidential information.

I have an old game from TSR (Star Empires?) that uses squares (a very old game)
with dots representing the stars and a number representing the height above/
below the ecliptic. Unfortunately it is difficult to give much additional
information without cluttering the display. This solution does make the stars
easy to locate (unlike Traveller.. oops. 2300AD which however is very accurate)
Jump-1 ships *are* a problem, as making a 3D map dense enough for their 
movement will cause considerable congestion in the hexes.

Maybe they have some good ideas....


A lot of this discussion can be summarized as: are we going to support the
standard Traveller/MegaTraveller rules and supplements or do some other
interesting things as well.
As far as I am concerned being on the traveller list, we should first
and foremost be able to represent the Tr/MTr system as is with no enhancements
from any program we generate. Then worry about the optional details.

Now let me argue against myself: We need to have some idea what enhancements
we are going to use to allow us to design the program and data structures
well. If our program is exactly according to the books, then we are not really
adding anything and may be in violation of copyright.
Furthermore I noticed an ad by DGP in the back of world builder\'s handbook:
Coming in Jan 1990, World builders handbook for computer, as well as the
second? survey data (ie. stats for the 11000 worlds)
This will be available for PC\'s, Mac, and two others of that ilk. 

What does everyone assume about stellar phenomenon? There has never been a
place for generating black holes, neutron stars, nebula, dust clouds, 
pulsars etc. I have always assumed that there were a lot more stars out there
than are actually drawn on the map. The other "unmapped" stars would only
be of passing interest to Scientists (1 month research trips and unmanned
montioring probes). All of these "stars" would have two things in common:
a) no fuel to speak of (interstellar hydrogen) b) no solid surfaces to
put bases or other strucures on.
Therefore they are not placed on the maps as jumpspace effectively ignores 
everything between the entry/exit points (maybe the navigator worries about 
them and their possible influence).

From: morrison@pyr.gatech.edu
Subject: Maps and 3D space (And a proposal...)
Dan has a good point in that we need to get going with something. Here
is my proposal:

   1) That we integrate existing software into one comprehensive
      package to generate systems in accordance with MegaTraveller
      guidelines. The existing software that (I think) we should
      integrate are James\' mapsub program (PostScript output), and
      the "real" system generator. We would have to tweak the
      Traveller side of the program to take input from the "real"
      side (in terms of hydrographic percentage, etc) for more 
      realistic systems, or vice-versa for "tunable" systems.

   2) We plan on the next extension to the system generator, which
      can be whatever the group wants (Determining trade routes,
      implementing 3D, planetary mapping, whatever).

Right now, we need a working prototype to give us something to play
with. We might want to consider getting a group of people to Alpha test
whatever we develope and tell us what else we might have overlooked.

For those of you  that don\'t have these two programs, let me know and
I\'ll send you the source.

I agree. I was envisioning several programs that would work like UNIX
pipes: feed the output of one into the input of the next. If you 
want a planet map, you would first have to have a sector map,
then you\'ld have your subsector extracted from that. You feed that into
system generator to get the number of planets, etc. You\'d extract the
one or more planets you were interested in and feed that into the 
map generator. The hard part is that the cohesion between the subsector
and system generators have to be tight (too much interaction between
determining the types of planets, where they are, trade routes, X-boat
routes, etc). Ideas?

BTW, I heartily agree with the need for modularity. The programming of this
over thethe internet is going to get heady.

I\'m working on a Sun-3/280 (for the moment). The project I\'m on will be
over by January, so I don\'t know what system I\'ll be working on
then (maybe my PC :-). I\'ll still have email anyway.

Subject: Starting point
To: sysgen-group

I think Dan has come up with a good starting place on breaking
up the resolution and scope of the various levels. Each of
these levels (as applicable) could be an individual program
taking data from a collection of data files generated by the
appropriate other levels. I think that having one common
database store the information would simply be too large and
unwieldy (access times on low-end [PC} systems would be
horrendous). I think we could come up with some sort of "pointer"
system -- one file for sectors containing the bare bones information
and name pointers indicating the names of the file to go to for
the system, which would have the name of the file(s) to go to
for each planet, etc. Also, unwieldy but it would be simple
to implement -- the hardest part would be gaurenting unique file
names.

I also received a message indicating an optional way to modularize
a generation system -- at least at the universe level. Ted 
Kim writes:

Last, are we going to open the 3D can of worms? It wouldn\'t be 
*that* difficult to doand it would be easy to implement realistic
stellar distances, but there are a *lot* of Jump-1 shipd out there
that could very easily get stuck in the sectors that we would generate.

I believe that there is no problem as to what we should cover, the old rules
for system generation are a subset of the Megatraveller rules, Megatraveller
just provides a labeling of the values presented in traveller (ie. wet world
instead of 60% hydrographics). Similarly with grand survey, it just provides
additonal information for the worlds (including a nifty plate tectonics and
surface mapping description). IMHO the "Program" should really be a series
of programs, each taking the system/subsector data to greater levels of detail, 
If you don\'t use the Megatraveller rules for instance, stop running the
programs before the megatraveller info gets added.
BTW does anyone have a short form for Traveller and MegaTraveller so a discussion
of the differences doesn\'t take forever to type?

I don\'t know if grand survey is still available...However, the World builders
handbook seems to cover everything in grand survey and grand census, but in
one book, and provides a more organized presentation.

Define support...A TL15 society wouldn\'t be native to such a system, but it
could be a game reserve and hunting park for the nobility. Often the most
interesting adventures occur when the GM makes up a reason for what looks to
be conflicting data on a world. However as a GM I often find it difficult to
make up the reasons.

City map could be very difficult, but I don\'t see any problem with the others
all should be optional however. I don\'t want 11000+ planetary maps for a sector
map of the Imperium.

I usualy use a lot of other SFRPG systems as source books for traveller. They
quite often have alternate information on their planet descriptions. I will
mail these when I get a change to llok them up. One that sticks in my mind though
was a % value for the locals reaction to off-worlders (assuming outside the
starport.)

World builders handbook *is* grand survey for MegaTraveller.

Not only does the progammer have to know C++, but there has to be a C++ compiler
on everyone\'s machine. I think that we should stick to C as it is the "universal"
language for all UNIX machines.

Now for my questions:

What machine is everyone working on...I have a sun 3/60 on my desk, and
access to SPARCstation (Sun), MIPS M/2000, Silicon Graphics 4D/70 and Personal
Iris (Note all are UNIX machines but vary between BSD, BSDish, and SysV)

Copyright, In Canada, there is not a problem, as we are not doing this for
a monetary gain, and as long as there is a discaimer indicating that the
program is for those people who already own Traveller/MegaTraveller... I don\'t
know what the situation is in the States.

In any programming project among several people, coordination can be the most
difficult item. If I improve some code and you improve the same code, it can
take forever to get them the same. Remember modularity is a must.

I believe also that there cannot be too much information, just too much
presented at one time. Albedo while not important to most is essential
for calculating the temperature of the planet. If you want to fiddle with the
charateristics (ie. it is too cold for your garden planet) some of these
obscure statistics can be useful.
I find that most of my players cannot make sense of the traveller statistics
for a planet (eg. Fubar 0203-A456345-9 Na GAm) means nothing to them, thus
we saw the expansion of the sector map from just having dots Starport and
name to gross planet type, bases, gas giant symbols etc. Visuals are often
more understandable and should be present in any postscript representation.

As we have several types of maps for our planet (road maps, contour/geographical
maps, political maps) so should a complete sector/subsector map. The types of
maps I can think of right away are:

1) Political (only useful if sector/subsector is not owned by a single
government as most of the Imperium was)
2) Jump maps - There is a section of the old rules describing the
connectivity of stars based on their starport and distance. I take this
to be a transportation map, which is significantly different from the
usual Xboat maps
3) Trade maps - A lot of worlds are good trade partners while others aren\'t
(I think the trade and commerce group would like somthing like this with
all the good trade routes marked perhaps as weighted vectors?)
4) Navigation maps - Stuff as much data onto the map as possible for players
to make visual comparison of destination worlds (This is the closest to the
current maps)
5) Strategic Maps - (This is still a foggy concept) Presumably the military
would want different information on their maps than the civilians...

I would rather design a program that can be used with any space RPG.  I
wrote the "starform" program with that in mind, so if there is information
that you\'re not interested in, it is simple to ignore it.  I\'m fairly happy
with the output from starform, but it does tend to generate boring systems.

One thing I\'d like is to be able to specify what planets/stars I\'d like to

Also, I think C would be the most portable language to use.  The starform
program used to be in Pascal, but I ported it to C for portability.

Subject: Welcome to the Star System Discussion Group
To: sysgen-group

Welcome one and all to the Star System Generation Discussion group. I\'m sure
most of you are wondering what we are going to do and what we should talk
about. Well, that\'s the first thing we have to decide. There are several
main points we need to consider before we even begin discussing what
we should include in our generation system(s): what we want to generate
(besides pure star systems), what type(s) of systems do we want to target,
what version(s) of Traveller do we want to support, and how \'realistic\'
do we want to get. Also, how many different generation systems do we
want to work on (one for systems, one for specific information on the
planets in each system, etc.).

Other considerations would be, do we want to adapt to something like the
Grand Survey and/or the World Builders handbook (both of which I don\'t
have - yet), how, too what extent, and copyright laws if we do.

MY ROLE
- ----
I am merely coordinating communication between the members of the discussion
group and the rest of the Traveller Mailing List membership. I\'ll take
all of the messages each week, "digestify" them and post the summary to
the mailing list. Another job of mine is to make sure that we stay on
track with the topic of creating a viable star system generation system. I
am by no means dictator of this group. My job is to keep personality conflicts,
flaming, etc to a minimum. My vote on design issues and implementation counts
no more nor less than anyone elses. The next section describes my *opinion* 
on where I think this group should go within the area of star system 
generation and what we should do. If the majority of the group thinks 
otherwise, we can change our methods.

OUR FUTURE
- ----
I envision us taking functionality from James\' PostScript program and the 
"real" star system program and then adding lots of features for something 
with lots of bells and whistles (with a varying level of detail at the 
referees request, PostScript or ASCII output, and generating sector to the 
planetary level of information). Things we can also add are planetary maps, 
city maps, and anything anyone wants. 

For those who want specifics, here is my humble opinion on what we
should aim for:

We should target both PC and UNIX system primarily, with other machines 
(Atari/Amiga, VMS) systems pending demand - and our time). We should use
C as the language of choice (since that\'s what most people know). Down
the line we may want to port to PASCAL, FORTRAN, and (oh no!) BASIC
for those on other platforms (VMS and PCs), but that\'s a long way off. I
would like to see the program be as realistic as possible without giving
too much \'technical\' information that doesn\'t do much for the game(eg.
albeido, etc). However, we need to add a \'make believe\' mode for outrageous 
star systems (eg.  ringworlds, Dyson spheres, trinary systems with 15 
planets (some habitable) all in stable orbits, something like Niven\'s Tree 
world [I can\'t remember the name of the book, but it\'s a torus with no real 
ground, but habitable non the less]) - you get the idea. In any event, we 
need to be consistent with the data we generate. There is no way (correct 
me if I\'m wrong) with a low denity and mass is going to have many heavy 
elements to support that TL15 society.

But this all comes from what people want. Well, you are all
players and/or referees - what do YOU want out of a system? We\'ve all
heard lots of "Wouldn\'t it be nice if..." questions. Let\'s give them
what they want.

So main things to decide now:

   - Which version of Traveller (Classic and/or Mega) do we want to
     target?
   - Do we want to tie in with the Grand Survey and the World Builders
     Handbook?
   - What type(s) and how many different generation system(s) do we want
     to create (sector/subsector/planetary info/ planetary map/city map)?
   - Aside from the standard information that any referee can find/make
     in the various books, what other useful information do we want
     to provide (planetary history, relations with the Imperium, etc)?
   - Are James Perkins\' subsector program and Matt Burdick\'s "real"
     generation program useful starting points?

Well, you can tell already that I ramble.

Well, that\'s enough from me. You have my ideas on where I think the group
should head. We have some decisions to make.

I run my campaign such that most weapons of a heavy nature are hard to
get unless you are on a very low law level world (in which case you are
most likely dealing with the black market/pirates/mob anyway).

On the upper tech/law level worlds, I have a couple of different black
markets, with listings of what the PC\'s can purchase, how much and what
the availability is (%).  I use a few different lists because for lower
tech worlds, you wont be able to get some stuff, and the same is true of
high law worlds.

I don\'t have anything cohesive with me (I\'m at school, home is 400 miles

Nukes are available in my world, although I restrict access to them.
Usually, you can only get them through governments.  Sometimes, the black
market will have some.  Corporations involved in deep space mining also
have some (where do you think the black market usually gets them from?).
Of course, if you get a character wealthy enough to buy the facilities
required to manufacture them, you could probably start building them for
yourself.  

Nukes are an accepted part of life in my gameworld.  They are a tool.
Like any tool, they can be misued, which is why societies have laws, ethical
systems, and sometimes religion.  There are much more dangerous things in
my world than nuclear weapons.

Gaming with nukes can be fun, but they do offer a problem for a GM who
likes to give his players a "way out" when they screw up--if you screw up
and get hit by a nuke, there is no way out.  If you\'re in a spacecraft and
a five-kiloton nuke hits, you\'re gone, you\'re hot plasma, end of story,
roll the credits, Mr. Carpenter.

Just one more "Remember, your actions may have reprecussions.  Think before
you act" kind of thing players may have to deal with.

One way to control players with/looking for nukes.  Make them legal, if they
are licensed.  Governments allow companies (player characters can incorporate
themselves, just the way authors and other private citizens do now, so they
can get around that one) to have nukes for industrial purposes, etc., but
they naturally want to keep tabs on anything so potentially destructive;
also, you only get to buy your nukes when you have permission (i.e., a 
license), and you have to apply for it and give good reasons.  Governments
may also get to approve each use of a nuke, depending on law levels, etc.
Not only does this make it difficult for characters to get nukes, but it
provides potential additional adventures because anyone who applies for
this kind of license will have a nice government file on them, and it lets
the GM punish players who misuse their nukes (if they wish to do so).

Enjoy.

     Yes.  Nuclear weapons are available in the Eight Worlds.  They are
technically illegal, but there is no effective law enforcement beyond
the Frontier.  No one who takes even the simplest precautions to hide
the identify of his ship need fear prosecution.  
     And nuclear weapons have been used:

     The availability of nukes raises the musical question:  Is such
attire appropriate for a gentleman?
     True, nukes are handy devices for clearing landing fields in otherwise 
unsuitable terrain:  They remove ground cover, produce a smooth hardened 
crust capable of supporting the weight of a small starship, and eliminate
hostile natives all in one simple fast operation.  But they are also:
     1) Expensive.  There are almost always cheaper ways to do the job.
     2) Inappropriate.  Most military opperations in the Eight Worlds
are mounted to grab loot.  Which loot is generally less valuable if it
takes the form of a cloud of ions.
     3) Marginally illegal.  Yes, there is no law enforcement outside
the Pale, but many worlds capable of producing weapons of mass destruction
also make some attempt to regulate their ownership.  One must locate a 
suitably unscrupulous dealer, procure the weapon in secret, and smuggle 
it off the planet.  These are not impossible tasks, but they are tasks.
     4) Ineffective aginst a sophisticated opponent.  While the physical
laws of the Eight Worlds universe evidently do not allow for atomic
damper fields, they do allow for small fast inexpensive missiles which 
home in on radiation sources.  
     Individually these considerations are trivial.  Collectively they
have served to deter casual exercise of the nuclear option except in
one EXTREMELY exceptional case.

No, I am not going to allow that either.  My campaign (which is just
starting) is going to be based on an Ahzanti High Lightning ship (owned
by the PCs) with the major weaponry removed.

As a rule, I strongly forbid them in my campaign, for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, they\'re illegal and Imperially controlled by the Rules
of War, or whatever the GDW term is. That\'s a strong deterrent even to the
black market, as the Imperial authorities have a way of finding people who
violate what little territory they reserve for themselves and making them 
go bye-bye.

Second, they\'re often not the best way to do things. There are better and more
effective ways of clearing land, breaking up asteroids, and eliminating large
scale military targets. About the only thing they\'re really good for is killing
large numbers of civilians in quick and gruesome fashion.

Third, they\'re terribly dirty and wasteful of precious land and resources. The
Imperial government as well as the various planetary governments frowns on such
waste; it\'s bad for business.

Since the military has and uses dampers on anything larger than a personnel
carrier, they only do well against civilian targets that can\'t afford to be
damped. This limits their effectiveness. However, the general abhorrence of
nuclear weapons in the Imperium obviates even marginally practical uses, like
convincing a shipload of pirates to leave you alone. In my campaign, the early
TL development of nukes is watched and controlled very carefully by the 
Imperium; failures in the policy (that we know of so far) are rare and far
between: Weipu, Ganulph (which was a military target in a dirty war) and
Asmodeus (which wasn\'t an Imperial world).

As a final psychological deterrent to players who seem to think that nukes are
somehow vital to prove (to me? to each other? I\'m still working on this one)
their machismo, I provide any number of hints that even the lowest orders of
criminalia in the Imperium regards people who use nukes to achieve their ends
with about the same solicitude as that the Dusseldorf underworld used in 
hunting down a child-murderer in the 1930s, as chronicled in the excellent
Fritz Lang movie "M". This is astonishingly effective:

SNOOTY CHARACTER: "How dare you cast aspersions on me, you villain?"
UNDERWORLD BOSS: "I\'m not the one trying to buy a nuke! Boys, take this
                  filthy stinkscrabbler out back and blow his head off."

As a side note, I wouldn\'t mind a discussion (here or via Email) on the topic
of Traveller players and (for want of a better word) player/character machismo.
After eleven years of running this game, I am finally enjoying the company of
a small group of players who equip themselves sensibly, disport themselves
maturely, and seem to have risen above the endless technological and military
variations on the childhood game of "my pee pee\'s longer than yours." There
may or may not be a need for someone, somewhere, to have nuclear weapons, I 
suppose, but the thought of putting them in the hands of players with something
(God knows what) to prove seems somehow obscene to me. Probably a character
fault of my own....

Within the Imperium, nuclear weapons are banned outright, except for use by the
regular Imperial forces.  Admittedly there is a small dispute going on as to who
exactly constitutes regular Imperial forces (:-) but I doubt any PC\'s are able
to stake any such claim.

I once played in a campaign about some Vargr.  I played a high charisma Vargr
who, by an interesting and fully played-out route, came to be in sole charge of
a 30,000 ton cruiser.  Fully armed.  It was TL16, too (check the Vargr Alien
module for the capital of the Kedzudh Aeng).  We had some fun, but I think we
had more fun when we were only using a little 400 ton corsair.

Hello everybody! Mr. Perkins hasn\'t put me on the mailing list yet ( soon
though ), but I couldn\'t resist tossing in my two cents on this subject
anyway.  

     As a referee, in my Traveller campaigns I severely restrict civilian
access to nuclear weapons, ESPECIALLY civilian player characters.  My 
reason for this is simply that I feel giving PCs nukes makes for poor
game balance.  I most emphatically DO NOT want a bunch of PCs with a
subsidized merchant taking on squadrons of Vargr corsairs, Imperial
cruisers, or whatever.  Believe me, some of my players would do it too!
Unfortunately, some of the people I have refereed were of a somewhat
militant mindset ( who hasn\'t refereed someone like that? ), so such
restrictions were necessary to the type of campaign I was attempting to 
run.  

     Basically, if you are going to permit the players to acquire heavy
weaponry, be it nukes, battle dress and FGMP-14s, or whatever, you have
to provide them with appropriate challenges to overcome.  The players 
have to be challenged as players, to keep them interested. Most players
would get bored knocking over cargo ships with a battlecruiser after a
while, or at least I\'d rather play with players who would...

     Anyway, that\'s some of my thoughts on the subject.  I\'d really
like to hear any comments on it.

	[ text delteted concerning PC\'s with nukes to save bandwidth ]

The one time I had characters with nukes was the time I was playing a character
who was the commander of some merc forces that had been hired by the Imperium 
to put down a particularly ugly civil war between internal parties to an 
autonomous state.   The concern here from the Imperial point of view was the 
fact that this conflict threatened the stability of of surrounding sectors.
The mercs were given carte blanche authority from as high as the Emperor 
himself  to use whatever means needed to put the civil war to an end.  

The real reason, unknown to the mercs at the time, that the Imperium was so 
interested in quelling this disturbance was that essential ingredients in the
Emperor\'s anagathic treatments originated from this area.  As long as the 
civil war blazed, no stuff! 

As it turned out, the nukes were never used.   Just the mere threat of the use
of nukes on the population centers was enough to bring the beligerants to the 
negotiating table.

I have allowed them in certain situations, nukes that is, but very rarely.
They have to go thru the local organized crime boss, usually. Plus the 
missiles cost about 10X book value, more if you upset your seller. True, 
you can\'t just go up to your local weapons dealer and say I\'d like three
tactical nuclear missiles, please, and could you gift wrap them they\'re 
for a friend. That would cause a raised eyebrow or to, at the local law 
enforcement agency.

Jim Cunningham\'s recent remarks about a pile of old HighPassage magazines
prompts me to ask after a related item.  Several of us on this list have
probably been looking for literally years for a copy of HighPassage #1.
Can Jim or anyone else lend me a copy or swap it or something.
Ive got extra issues of some of the old Judges Guild sectors, a duplicate 
copy of Paranoia Press\' Beyond, and like Jim more than a few old copies
of High Passage and Far Traveller.  I\'d like to exchange some or all of
this for a readable edition of Paranoia Press\' other sector booklet, which
I think was for the Old Expanses.  My regular mail address may be useful
for this: Mark Leymaster, PoBx 2569, Boston, MA 02208.  Thanks

     There has always been a Frontier.

     What is the Frontier?  This question has many answers.  Some would
say that the Frontier is the place where civilization ends.  Others
would refer to physical obstacles such as mountains, deserts, or
for a starfaring civilization, the place beyond which there were no 
ready bases or fueling stations.  Still other folk, those of a morbid 
temperment, would define the Frontier to be the border between the
region where it is safe to travel and regions from which travellers
often fail to return.  But all of these definitions have one thing 
in common:

     Beyond the Frontier there is no law.

     Why, you may ask, is this so?  The answer is obvious.  Whatever 
its nature, be it border of civilization, a physical barrier, or the
boundary of a place where travellers routinely vanish, the Frontier 
represents a barrier to law enforcement as well.  Those charged with 
enforcing the law require a civilization in which to opperate.  They 
require bases and fueling stations.  They certainly need to stay alive.
Without these conditions, there can be no law enforcement.  And to
quote Jack Vance, "Law cannot reach where enforcement will not follow."
     A curious observation, you say, but one without relevance to my
game.  Perhaps so.  That is my very point.  I have followed the Nuclear
Controversy with some interest, and notice that many of you prohibit
or restrain the use of nuclear weapons through some reference to the
law.  This implies that adventurers opperate within the region where
law holds sway.  It implies that adventurers opperate INSIDE the 
Frontier rather than beyond it.

     My question is.  How many of you really believe or intend this
to be the case?  How many of you deliberately intend your players
to opperate inside the bounds of an all-encompassing civilization?
How many of you chose instead to force your players to devise their
own laws, to define their own moral code without recourse to or
dependance upon the strictures of their parent civilization?
     And what is the reason for your choice?

     To be fair, I should answer my own questions:
     In the Eight Worlds, the Frontier is defined by the orbital 
defense zones of the eight major worlds (Terra, Goa, San Vincento,  
The Plieades Federation, Great Belt, New Carina, Redstar, and 
Outback).  Outside this limited volume of space all is Wilderness.
There is no law except that which is enforced by coherent photons.
Pirates and raiders opperate with impunity.  Those sapients, vessels,
the prey of such.
     The major worlds do occasionally send forth their navies to
enforce some kind of order.  But these actions can rarely be
distinguished from the actions of the pirates and raiders they
purport to oppose ("Nice planet you\'ve got there squire.  Be a
pity if anything happened to it.  You should join the New Carinan
Mutual Defense Alliance.")
     Matters were not always thus.  Legend tells of a time centuries
past when the entire Orion Arm flourished in peaceful prosperity
under the benign rule of the Terran Imperium.  But those days, if
they existed at all, are centuries gone.  The Empire was destroyed 
centuries ago, if it was ever more than a myth.

     I run such a campaign for two reasons.
     First, I have always been fascinated by the Wilderness.  I do
not wish to live there myself.  If I were to be suddenly transported 
to the Eight Worlds, my lifetime would probably be measured in minutes.  
But I enjoy exploring such an existance in the comfort and safety of 
my own living room.
     Second, a world without laws is a sort of moral mirror.  The
characters which opperate such a world, and to a certain extent
their players as well, must take responsibility for their own actions.
They have no one else to blame.  In the process they will eventually
confront themselves, and learn if they are truly good or truly evil.
     The results are often interesting...

I just read Chris\'s letter (he looks like a valuable addition to the 
group) and I was intrigued by his comments about the problems in keeping
players from getting bored.  I have the same problem sometimes because,
realistically, it\'s not that hard for a person who wants to become some
version of superman from doing so.

For example, one of my players, Tim, has put a lot of time and credits 
into building up his one weapon skill--Class II (rifles).  He has the
skill at +4, and he has taken advantage of all my special rules.  He
bought a custom laser rifle (very expensive, but it gives you an additiona
additional +2 to hit), AND he is using both a smart weapon system with
a biocontrol interface that hooks into his nervous system (another +2),
AND a skill chip hooked into a memory plug.  In effect, he has Laser Rifle
at +9.  (For those interested in these devices, read various cyberpunk
novels, especially Neuromancer, Count Zero, Schizmatrix, When Gravity
Fails, A Fire in the Sun, and Islands in the Net--they\'re all great 
novels in addition to providing some really nifty ideas for GM\'s).

Anyway, back to Tim.  Tim, knowing why it is important to NOT BE SEEN
bought a stealthed combat vacsuit (remember Predator?  A stealth suit
uses a wraparound videocell system that receives and then transmits
light hitting your body so you\'re almost invisible--the almost is a
big factor).  In daylight, people kind of notice the shimmer; at night,
you might as well be Sauron wearing the One Ring.  (Oh, yes, Tim got
the laser rifle stealthed too.)

Now all this cost about a million credits.  But Tim is pretty invincible
because he usually can\'t be seen, he\'s fast enough to get off the first shot
most of the time (especially when he\'s hidden), and he hits just about any-
thing he shoots at.  I don\'t mind too much.  I run a gameworld where if
you screw up in a gunfight, you die, but if you\'re smart in a gunfight, you
live (as it should be).  Still, unless I want to send someone as dangerous
or worse after Tim, what do I do?  I don\'t like using cheesy things like
"Oh, your stealth suit shorted out.  For no reason."

This long and rambling example, besides serving to offer a few ideas to
fellow GM\'s, if they want to use them, is dedicated to the question of:

   Once they get powerful, how do you deal with them without 
   just screwing them over?

My own solution is to let them become corporates or politicals.  The
problems of running a business (outwit your competition...catch those
industrial spies...deal with hostile--hey, an armed fleet approaching
your asteroid is about as hostile as it gets--takeover attempts) or
running a country (outwit our competition, I mean ideological opponents...
catch those spies...deal with hostile takeover attempts, I mean invasions
and rebels...is there an echo in here?) keeps people pretty busy.

One final note.  Just so everyone won\'t think all I do is try to make
my players miserable, I try to sometimes run just goofy adventures where
no one really gets hurt, even if they don\'t make much money.  If you want
a good "module" for this kind of thing--rent the Marx Brothers movie 
"Animal Crackers" and then let your players get invited to this kind of
party and be involved in finding the lost painting.  Even if you don\'t
want to do this, rent the movie, it\'s hysterical.  (For those who do
use the movie as a module, remember that Harpo Marx should never, NEVER
be given a loaded gun, no matter how often he "asks" to be allowed to
play with one.)

Take care all.  Enjoy.

     Mark

    Most of you seem to be discussing things over my head. Literially.
I am not so much concerned with generating huge number of stars but things
of planet sized and lower.
    The reccomended grid for worlds looks something like this:

               /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\
              /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\      I.e. a 20 sided dice.
             /____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\
            /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /
           /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /
          /____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\/
          \\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /
           \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /
            \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/

    You put hexes down the sides (one for each size of the world gives
you a constant scale) and pentegrams on the corners. This is really peachy
and plesant but has several drawbacks if you want to try to implement this
on a computer (If you don\'t trust me, I leave it as an exercise).
    Firstly I will outline what is needed for a computer representation:
    1) There must be a simple way to thread the sphere. I.e. we must easialy
be able to visit every point once and only once.
    2) We must be able to find all represented points withing a certain
radius of our subject point. E.g. I need all nodes within two of this one.
    3) We must be able to trace a diameter in a small number of cardinal
directions eventually reaching our starting point.
    4) It must be recursively definable. I.e. we must be able to increase
the resolution infinately.

    So what do we do?
    Hexes are nice, traditional and great for flat surfaces but a bit of a
bollox when you hit the corners. I think triangles are out best bet. Lets
work through the criteria in reverse order.
    (4) Recursively definable:

      /  \\             /  \\             /8_\\

    (3) diameter.
    Always stand in a triangle with our backs to a base. If we go through
the left face, then with our back to that in the new triange go through the
right face repeatedly we will circumnavagate the sphere. Choosing which
base and wether to go left or right first gives us six directions.
    (2) find all points within a radius
    If you assume that an adjacent triangle is a triangle sharing
a base you have no problem and minimal difficulty on corners. A more
attractive way is to have any triangle which shares a vertex be one
unit away. This has rather more difficulties.
    (1) threading the sphere.
    I haven\'t been able to come up with an algorithmical way to do this.
It is, of course, trivial if one numerically orders the triangles. This
brings us to my mental block. To come up with a numbering system for
the triangles of the sphere that caters for the conditions above.
    What this boils down to is that the above scheme is mathematically
elegant it needs four things to make it usefull. (4) a way of uniquely 
identifying {preferably with an integer, or ordered pair} each triangle
element on the sphere. This numbering system must remain compatible as
the resolution is increased. (3) A function that when given a location
id and a direction, returns a location id of the next triangle along 
that diameter. (2) A function that is passed a location and returns
a fixed number of locations distance one from the given location. (1)
A function that given a locations returns another location such that
if continually called with the return value it will cycle through all
locations before returning.
    Is there a fresh mind out there that can see what I can\'t?

    GAELCON-89 -- the first Irish International Games Competition

    Well for the participants it was a great success; financially it
was rather worse. My own little corner of it was the MegaTraveller
Role-Playing competition. We had planned for ten tables of eight
people with a terminal displaying library data on each table. Having
been roped into general organisation at the very end coupled with
hardware inconsistancies we only managed eight tables with sparodic
operation.
    Myself and the other two organisers (Lesley Grant & Oisin Murphy-
Lawless) put an awful lot of work into the scenario. In the end it
weighed in at 98 pages and 33,000 words. It was purely a role-playing
scenario. I.e. people were judged on how well they role-played. The
players were all playing doctors who had requisitioned space on a
luxary liner for a mission of mercy. All 41 NPCs of the ship were
detailed with loads of interaction. No personal objectives for the PCs
and no central plot.
    This had two effects. First you had the player that is used to
having paths lead out for them. The kind the referee has to lead around
by their nose. These were at a complete loss. They wandered around
provoking NPCs in a most undoctorlike fashion. Trying to make trouble
so "something would happen".
    Then you had the real role players. These had a field day. There was
a great variety in background amongst the NPCs and as we had play-tested
it ten times the referees were very familiar with them.
    If the whole scenario was played from day one to day five it would
probably take 18 hours. But then it was designed to be a 3.5 open ended
competition. If there are enough people interested (and there is the
space) I will upload them to the server.

RE: nukes

Assuming players were to purchase nukes on one of the multitude of black
markets that exits in the Imperium.  What is to say that the equipment,
with which to detonate the nuclear explosive, actually works.  If they
get the nuclear weapon from some back water planet with a minimal
technology to even build the things, they may not have perfected a
detonator.  Or as in the movie "The Manhatten project", I think, where
the boy steals the nuclear matereal.  His detonater that he builds is
partialy ruined by the radiation.  I am not saying the radion of the
weapon it self would set it off or break it.  But what about the powerfull
magnetic feilds created by the powerplants and the engines?  What effect
might they have on the detonator?

re: Powerfull players

The equipment that powerefull players is VERY delicate.  For instance,
the FGMP-14 and -15 along with the PGMP-14 have a relatively unlimited
number of shots.  EXCEPT if you read the note below the chart in either
Striker or Mercinary(I forget which), but it says this is the case only
if the player or someone recharges the fusion power pack and does routine
mantinance once a month.  So if the players don\'t take care of their
equipment, it is bound to get aged and thus faulty.  Look at cars.  If
you don\'t take care of it, even the best cars around, they will wear down
and break without sceduled maintenace.  And then any breakdown will be
relativly predictable.  So in order to keep things in top condition, they MUST
take care of their equipment.  Why do you think the routine maint. is
sceduled on star ships once a year?

A few misc. things:

Some of you have had problems reaching me via "direct" E-mail.
This system I am using, I am told, will only recognize my
address if everything is in lower case letters; anything in
caps will bounce back.

I have received several messages indicating interest in High
Passage back issues. I\'m happy to supply them-- all I ask is
$1 for each copy to cover postage, and please let me know of
your regular address so I know where to send them. If you\'re
interested, please drop me a line about what issues you want
and your post address, and I\'ll send \'em post haste. I also 
need your address to send copies of old JTAS articles. My
postal address is:

Jim Cunningham
1604 Coronado Dr. #7
Champaign, IL 61820

Regarding HP #1, I only have a couple of copies myself. We
only printed 1,000, and they were gone before we knew it.
You might try your local game convention auctions-- I\'ve 
seen copies sold for less than cover price. Besides, #1 
was our first effort, and trust me, it\'s not that good (well,
it\'s better than any of the junk Group One ever did...).

Regarding sector data for the Imperium: DG is going to
put out the sector data of the Imperium on disk for most
popular computer formats; see the inside back cover of
The World Builder\'s Handbook for info. GDW used to have
a photocopied hard copy available called Sector Data which
you could order from them, but that was a while back and
it may very well no longer be available. They also put out
The Atlas of the Imperium which had "abbreviated" sector
maps with some infor like starport type and things. That\'s
out of print too.

Have a good weekend, my friends.

I just read Paul\'s discussion of the frontier.  It is very similar to
my own, in terms of how law operates, etc.  I thought I would describe
the parameters of the "frontier" in my gameworld for anyone who wants
to use these ideas.

First, I don\'t use the Jump drive system; instead, solar systems are
linked by what I call hypergates--remember the star gates in 2001?  It\'s
the same "big machine that punches a hole through hyperspace" routine.
I do this for two reasons--one, I find it more plausible, and two, it
allows the GM greater control over who gets into any particular solar
system.  Hypergates can basically open a gateway to anywhere in the
universe, but there are problems with opening a gateway closer than
two or three billion km. from a star-sized mass.

Also, I don\'t believe in gravity control.  This means that spacecraft
boost at one gravity (or sometimes more than that, but not for very long;
obviously, spacecraft can have powerful engines that will let them go at
extreme speed for a while, and there are drugs that counteract some of the
effects of high gravity (for a while), etc.)  This means that besides the
standard "new solar system being colonized" frontier, you\'ve got an even
bigger and better one waiting for players in every existing solar system.

The cometary halo.  

The cometary halo extends to about one third the distance to the next star.
About one light year.  Cometary nuclei are believed to be spaced about two
billion km. apart.  Roughly, that means one hundred billion to one trillion
cometary nuclei in any cometary halo/oort cloud.  Since it takes about
three months to travel one hundred billion km. at one gravity (coasting
about two thirds of that time because there is a limit to how much fuel
you can carry, even if you are using fusion engines), most of the cometary
halo is totally beyond the reach of any central authority.

So what, I hear you ask.  Comets are useless.  Big, dirty snowballs.  
Oh, contrare, mon frere (or however that\'s spelled).  Comets are (a) water,
(b) hydrogen (= fuel for fusion power plants), (c) a small percentage of
organic chemicals and silicates ( = raw materials for building materials
and synthesized foodstuffs and trade goods).  If you belong to a space-
industrialized society, comets certainly don\'t rank as high as a good
high metal content asteroid, but they are a real source of usable raw
materials.  (=habitats....and adventures).

So who the hell lives out there?  Well, anyone who finds an asteroid belt
with a population of two hundred billion two damned crowded.  Anyone who
feels that opportunities in the cometary halo with its quintillions of tons
of untapped and unclaimed raw materials make it worth the risks and hard-
ships of going out there.  (After all, when you have London, why would
anyone risk the wilderness of, say, Ohio?  Because there are opportunities.)
Anyone who is at odds with the ruling ideology.  (Yes, hippies in space.)
Or anyone who is running from the law, or exiled by the law.  Religious
cults.  Corporate outposts.  Research facilities.  Mining colonies.  
Pirate bases.  Rebel bases.  (Not to mention friendly, and unfriendly
military outposts placed in the halo so they can observe the inner system--
with big space telescopes...free floating antenae can be made of wire and
kilometers across in free fall--in safe isolation.)  All this and more.
Waiting for anyone with a little capital and enough nerve to stake a claim.
Just like our player characters, huh?

Well, I\'ve rambled long enough.  Take care, all.  Enjoy.

     Mark

We sometimes do things like this. We have "shore leave" adventures every
once in a while where we all go out bar hopping (getting thrown out of bars
causes us to move often). Our characters are the crew of a starship so we
play sailors on leave; carousing people out to have a boisterous good time.

Of course, we *always* get into some sort of trouble. Once two of the
characters decided to have a drag race in downtown Toronto... the resulting
multi-vehicle high speed chase was both amusing and destructive...

We even invented a skill, "carousing". useful for picking up members of the
opposite sex, *not* getting clobbered by people larger than oneself, etc.

It is fun to get away from adventuring and just have a good time... (And
yes, we do go out carousing in real life too; we just don\'t get into as much
trouble doing it).

Do you people REALLY make your players say, "I\'m doing maintenance on my rifle
and sharping my boot knife."  I would interpert this as very bored players.

Ship maintenance I can see, this takes special equipment and lots of time.
But unless there is an overwelming reason to believe that the work couldn\'t
have been performed.

Do the players have to say they are backing up there computers disk files?
How about cleaning there clothes?  :-)

Well, as Imperial cruisers are about the only ships legall allowed nukes,
the PC\'s life expectancy is rather short.  Vargr corsairs aren\'t allowed
them, but since when do they care what they\'re allowed?  They might have
problems getting them, though - even Vargr worlds are going to be careful]
who they allow to buy such weapons.

Like opposition similarly armed.  That\'s the real problem with such things;
combat tends to be lethal.  At least if you get hit by a gauss rifle, you
can survive to pay the doctor.  By contrast, even a near miss from a FGMP
is dangerous, and a hit is fatal even if you\'re wearing the best armour.

     I\'ve been reading some of the old TML traffic, and I noticed that a 
common complaint with MegaTraveller is the starship design rules.  I have
encountered similar problems also, especially where the ships in the Imperial
Encyclopedia are concerned.  Has anyone noticed that the ships in the 
books don\'t obey the construction rules?  I mean, that if you try to build
similar ships, you can\'t get anything even close to the specifications 
listed in the Encyclopedia!  

     The reason that I\'m bringing this up again is that I think that I might
have discovered something that will make the rules and ships match.  When
I first looked at the Imperiallines TJ transport in the Rebellion Sourcebook,
I thought something was really wrong with it. REALLY WRONG. Anyway, I sort
of redesigned it to suit my tastes, trying to get something like the TJ 
originally given in The Traveller Adventure.  The problem is that the 
fuel consumption values for fusion power plants make it impossible to 
fuel such a ship for the 30 days recommended for starships.  I found that
if I assumed that a TL15 fusion plant consumed 0.003 kiloliters of fuel per
hour, instead of the 0.009 listed, then my version of the TJ turned out to
closely match the original version ( old Traveller ).  Almost the same cargo
space, room for full sized staterooms, and enough power for inertial 
compensators, an Active EMS array, and a little left over for extra add-ons.
This is with a 11,600 Mw output power plant.  Also, I removed the nuclear
damper pack to save cargo space.  It just seemed dumb to have a ship as 
well-armed as the TJ blind because it didn\'t have any active sensors...

Subsequently, I\'ve been assuming that all fusion power plants consume 
0.003 Kl of fuel per hour per Kl of power plant, regardless of tech level.
It seems to work.  I haven\'t had a chance to go over any other ships yet,
what with midterms here at the U of R, but if anyone could let me know if
my idea is applicable to the other ships, please do. One thing I\'d 
particularly like to know is if the design errors affect not only GDW\'s
designs, but DGP\'s ship listings as well.  Could be a royal pain... :-)

Not that this has anything to do with ship design, but... Upon meeting
a female Vargr passenger, on of the PCs cracked, " Ok, so she\'s a dog. "
( Not in the Vargr\'s hearing, of course ). I thought it was funny...

     Mark has posed the question, \'How does one deal with the
Challenge posed by powerful characters?\'  At first glance, this
appears to be a worthy question.  After all, powerful characters 
have a depressing tendancy to anhilate any obstacle which is 
placed in their path.  They make mincemeat of the most powerful 
NPCs.  In short, they take a GMs carefully designed and well 
balanced scenario and break it into little teeny pieces, a sorry 
fate.
      After days, hours, possibly even seconds of mind-numbing
cogitation, I believe that I have discovered a small problem with
one of the assumptions which underlies the question.  Rather
than attempt to describe this problem in detail, I offer this
short story with a moral:


                      THE CHALLENGE

     Morris Minor peered around the corner of the alley.  There
was no one in sight.  He blended back into the night and checked
his gear.
     He wore a skin-tight suit of Xyram, fine overlapping scales
which would resist explosions, energy, projectiles, or blades.  A
combat helmet and filters provided protection against sonic
attack or noxious gasses.  Servos in the armour gave him the
strength of many men.  The armour was covered with a correlation
envelope which rendered it invisible to vision, radar, and 
infra-red.
     His weapon was a Kodak HK-47 Instamatic, a powerful pulsed
laser weapon whose coherent beam could burn through the heaviest 
of armour, the mightiest of shields, or both, with equal facility. 
The effect the beam had on the unprotected flesh within was
alarming.  The weapon was not controlled or directed by anything 
so crude as a trigger.  It was connected directly to his nervous 
system, which nervous system had augmented to increase its speed
and was interfaced to sensors in his helmet.  Morris could 
encompass the destruction of anything that came within range of 
those sensors.  In an instant.  With but a single thought.
     The same augmentations which increased his speed also
rendered Morris invisible and immune to psionic powers.
     He was the perfect assasin.
     Morris crossed the street.  Were there anyone to observe,
they might have heard a faint whisper of wind.  They might have
seen the slightest flicker at the edge of their vision.  But no 
one listened.  No one saw.  Morris was one with the night.
     He reached his destination, a small machine set into the
wall of a corner building.  He activated a device which supressed
all sounds.  He removed a small card from an envelope at his
waist and inserted it into the machine.  A panel slid up to reveal
a small keyboard.  Morris entered the code he had been taught.
     The machine gave no immediate response.
     Morris repeated the code.
     A message flashed on the screen.
     "Dear Customer, we regret that this ATM is out of order.  
Thank you for banking with IPBank."
     Morris stared at the machine in rage.  Was it possible that
he could be thwarted so easily?  This was scarcely likely.  He
was Morris Minor, the Perfect Assasin!  He waited for the machine 
to return his ATM card.  He would re-insert the card and try a 
second time!
     Nothing happened.
     Realization came quickly.  The machine had swallowed his ATM
card!  How could such a thing occur?  Surely such a thing was not
possible!  Was he not Morris Minor, the Perfect Assasin?  He
staggered backwards in astonishment and was run over by a truck.

AND THE LESSON WE LEARN FROM THIS STORY IS:

     Combat skills are not always particularly useful to a member 
of an advanced technological civilization.

After reading the humorous treatise on how to deal with powerfull PC\'s, a
referee who\'s campaign I played in came to mind.   Whenever PC\'s became too 
powerfull they would either become part of the establishment and therefore 
be too busy to be a problem, or a plague would break out.  Rather effective.
Then there was always the problem of taxes, etc.   In his campaign you couldn\'t
outrun the Imperium.  They always eventually got their man.

Ah, here\'s my $0.02.

Or, if you are prone to having trigger-happy players, you could always
set them up for a horrible case of mistaken identity, where they blow
the head off some small, helpless innocent, like a small child.  Or
subject them to an enemy that can\'t be plowed over (say they enslave
children, for example, and the children are forced to confront the
all-invincible PC).  In theory this could force your players into a
moral quandary where they would actually have to begin to think...

Perhaps I\'m just too manipulative as a Referee...

I had a similar scenario of a campaign of mine.  Only the reason that neither
the  Zho\'s or the Imperium had much sway in the buffer zone was that after so
much fighting there wasn\'t enough of either government\'s forces left for them
to fight one another.   Also in my campaign there was a pocket of the "Ancients"
that survived their final war.  Their tech level was high enough to bring both
parties to the bargaining table.  (Here goes shades of Star Trek\'s Origani 
Treaty.)   Both sides were threatened by the "Ancients" with destruction of 
their forces if they did not honor a 20 X 24 parsec buffer zone between them.
As a result, this area was left to their own devices and set up several small
confederacies within this space.   Hence, why most of the adventuring was done
within this area.

As I see it, within both the Imperium and Zhodani Consulate there exist all
sorts of world governments.  There are caste democracies within the Zhodani
Consulate (in fact, I thought the Consulate was one).  There are probably
socialist governments in the Imperium - they\'d count as either democracies or
self-perpetuating oligarchies, depending on the referee\'s view of socialism
and whether it was Western or Eastern type socialism.

Just in case the PC\'s aren\'t susceptible to such moral dilemmas, because they
don\'t have morals (likely, given our earlier descriptions), it does no harm
to have something really powerful in reserve.  Something which can remind them
they\'re not Masters of the Universe.  Something which can eliminate them with
much the same ease as they\'d eliminate a small, not-too-bright rodent. A few
possibilities:

Imperial Marines.  I used the "Striker" combat rules, and just about never let
PC\'s get hold of the high-tech battledress, which was impervious to anything
except FGMP\'s.  Marines get the stuff as standard.  But, if the PC\'s do get
hold of FGMP\'s and/or such battledress:

Imperial Marine Grav APC.  As seen in Striker, book 3.  Armoured to resist
anything short of a tac nuke, and armed with a heavy rapid-pulse fusion gun,
a range of nuclear missiles, and a laser carbine.  In addition, the Marines
inside can stick their FGMP\'s through ports in the side and fire out.  But
if the PC\'s do have tac nukes, or if they just sit in their starship and try
to zap the APC from orbit:

Tigress class dreadnought.  As seen in Supplement 8, Fighting Ships.  Maximum
armour, maximum firepower, enough screens and computers so that the PC\'s nukes
won\'t get near it.  It also carries 300 fighters in case you want to give the
PC\'s one last warning.  If the PC\'s have something capable of taking out one of
these, use a full squadron.  If they can beat that, there\'s something wrong
with the universe.

Summary: Peace through superior firepower!  If they think being trigger happy
solves everything, show them just how right they are.

I\'ve been reading the responses to my initial question--Paul\'s is great,
except my players aren\'t quite that stupid...well, most of the time--and
I thought I would share some of my own techniques. 

The two real obstacles are, I think, fairness and elegance.  Anyone can
make an arbitrary decision that the NPC gets the first shot, and gets a 
hit.  I don\'t think anyone here does that to their players (with the
rare exception of a player who is REALLY asking for it), so that\'s not
too much of a problem.  

The peace-through-superior-firepower solution is one that I generally
have to rely on.  You have to be careful, though; unless you simply want
to make certain things totally off limits to a group of characters, you
can only make your NPCs a little more powerful than they are.  (Yes,
you have a five hundred ton corvette with a particle beam...it can blow
the socks off any unarmed merchants...uh oh, is that a sixty thousand ton
battleship on your screens?  Oh no, Mr. Bill....!)  And even here, you
have to be careful to keep the situation from simply being one of who
gets the first three really good rolls.  Sometimes, of course, it can
work, if the aim of the adventure is to take out a larger opponent\'s
forces via guerilla tactics, identifying weak points and hitting those
and staying away from the ones you can\'t beat--the decision being left
to your players.  In short, the problem here is that it is easy to
hit your players with something that they simply cannot stop (even if
you have Fleet Tactics +5 and a couple of dreadnoughts, the GM can always
send twice as many ships at you under a guy with +8) but giving them
something that they have a good chance of beating, although they will
have to sweat to do it.

I\'ve sometimes found, by the way, that the most enjoyable adventures
are ones where people have to figure something out, as opposed to simply
blowing it up (of course, sometimes they have to do this, too).  I 
once had my players on their corvette being followed by a probe that
stayed at the borders of their sensor range so they could not get very
good information on it.  It was simply keeping tabs on them.  Didn\'t
do anything else.  Had them spooked, though, until they found out what
it was.

The trouble is that is it hard to come up with good mysteries.  Commando
missions are easy because they\'re really all the same; the only thing that
changes is the precise mission objectives and the skill levels and weapons
of the NPCs shooting at them.

Ho hum.  Take care all.

I was curious if anyone in the mailing list has women running as player
characters.  A few of my female friends run in my game world.  They are
often a lot more level-headed than some of my male friends who run.  I
was wondering if anyone had any comments on this subject.

Also, for those interested in cruel jokes to play on their players...

Androids can basically look like any humanoid, right?  And a good AI
program can give them pretty much any "personality," right?  The next
time you\'re bored, and want to throw a random encounter at your
players, let them run into one of the Chuck Jones/Mel Blanc cartoon
characters.  The android will be a lot smarter than your player 
characters (well, most of them) and have a variety of neat, annoying
gadgets at its command (all from the Acme company, of course).  It
will also have a good enough Dex. to avoid being shot, at least the
first time.

How well will your characters do against Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner?
Think about it.

     Yes.  Well, I used to.  A while ago, we changed game systems and
GMs (we tend to do that periodically).  It\'s a fairly large group--four
women, five men.  We\'ve ended up in some, ah, *interesting* situations,
too.

     Sure.  Level-headed?  Yes, I agree with that.  Also (at least in
the case of the ones I game with) *much* more vicious and bloodthirsty.
Straight-forward, too.  We have this one gentleman in our group who
tends to look for hideously complicated solutions to just about anything
(we all know someone like that, don\'t we?  :-) ).  Half the time he
gets his thunder stolen by one particular lady who gets tired of his
dithering (to tell the truth, she isn\'t alone) and does something
direct (like tossing a grenade into a room without worrying about
whether or not it\'s occupied).

     Now, is it just my particular set of female friends, or are most
(all?) female gamers (vaguely) like this?  I mean, level-headed, direct,
dangerous, and no nonsense.  I\'m just wondering about *gamers*, too.

 >Also, for those interested in cruel jokes to play on their players...

     Oh, always...  ;-)

     Right...  The possibilities are very interesting...  I\'d better
not describe the Biff-bot, though...  :-)

Maybe I\'m a little slow, but doesn\'t anyone here ever watch Star Trek?

Both the old and the new programs give GM\'s amazing ideas on what they
can do to their players next.  True, your players probably watch ST also,
but if you can\'t modify an episode sufficiently to give your players a
decently complex situation, then you\'re not thinking hard enough.

My personal favorite is setting up parallel worlds with facist (sp?) govm\'ts
and letting the players get tangled up dealing for arms, drugs, etc.

I have gotten several positive replies to my script that I am developing.  I 
have a last(?) bug that I am trying to iron out, and as soon as I am done with
fixing that, I will post the thing as a "shar".   

The final bug I have found is that on some versions of troff/pic it chokes on 
the hex map at the end and screws up the aspect ratio.   Probably something 
simple I am overlooking,  so you\'ll be seeing this shortly.

On women in TRAVELLER....

I have run a great number of female players and characters in my campaigns, 
including an all-female party that did quite well in comparison to the male 
parties I was running at other times. The ladies felt that the guys weren\'t 
giving them a fair shake, and as it turned out, they were right. The only 
tough part was explaining to people who didn\'t know me what I did on Friday 
nights ("Well, I go into a deserted student lounge in my dorm with five 
women, and we, uh, play games."). |->

The other big opportunity for women in my games is the Near Miss series of 
adventures, where four of the eight primary characters are women. It\'s been my 
experience, at the past six conventions where I\'ve run Near Miss, that the 
players get into character best and have the easiest time of it when they run 
characters of the same sex as theirs. The closest to this ideal I\'ve ever 
managed was three gals and five guys, which was phenomenal. I\'d dearly love to 
run at least one Near Miss session with a real four-and-four split before I 
retire from cons; even better is when you get a boyfriend and girlfriend or 
husband and wife playing a married couple. If they\'re good role-players, the 
characters will come to life anyway, but the extra interplay from people who 
know each other THAT well ;-> gives the game an extra touch of realism. One 
young lady, who won an award for best job of roleplaying, actually started
screaming when her husband\'s character got shot last game! It scared the heck
out of everyone else in the gaming hall, though....

I love the opportunities that TRAVELLER allows for women. It\'s one of the few 
SF RPGs that doesn\'t force women into male-libido-stimulating poses, whether 
deliberately or otherwise. The rules are strictly free of gender bias (except 
for one or two non-human species), and GDW and DGP, rather than trying to 
attract buyers (usually young, male, and hopelessly, er, inexperienced) with 
book and gamebox covers that depict women as blaster-wielding sex/death/danger 
objects (e.g. Living Steel, Space Opera, SpaceMaster, or anything involving
art by Larry Elmore), show women in TRAVELLER as being attractive, perhaps, 
but always competent and in control of their lives (e.g. the TARSUS set, or 
the art of level-headed female artists like Donna Barr and Liz Danforth), fit 
partners for men but never dominatrixes or helpless damsels. Refreshing. 

For those who\'ve never run with women, I recommend the experience strongly. 
My one regret about my current TRAVELLER party, which is 100% mature, smart, 
and skilled, is that it\'s also 100% male. Some of our lady friends, who are by
and large excellent gamers themselves but who don\'t feel the need to game on a
weekly basis, have elected to form a "Traveller Widows\' Club" and get together
and socialize, ELSEWHERE, while we game. Oh, well. *sigh*

Deep Space, somewhere between Suleiman and Easter in the Solomani Rim: 1117

	"Heads up, gang," Grant muttered. The undulating greyness of 
jumpspace gave way to the star-dotted velvet black of deep space, and the 
Serendipity\'s sensor boards lit up and began processing data frantically.
Grant looked up and out of the huge viewport, scanning the skies for any 
unusual sights. "Kherk," he said absently, "How\'s it look?"
	"Working on it," Kherkhoulloth said mildly, practiced hands flying 
over the controls of the nav panel. A threedee star map appeared before him, 
rotated slowly and shifted a tiny bit. He barked loudly, a Vargr\'s best try at 
a laugh. "Harf! Kakh, I\'m good! I am so GOOD! I want a raise, Cap\'n!"
	"I assume," Grant said drily, "That we\'re where we want to be."
	"Close enough to hit with a thrown rock!"
	"Nice work. Start setting up our next jump, and pulling fuel from the 
reserve tanks. We\'re halfway between nowhere and nowhere right now, and I 
don\'t want to be stuck here any longer than I have to."
	"Aye, sir."
	Grant flicked on the shortcom and called, "Power deck!"
	"Sanchez here, sir." The voice sounded harried but happy, he noted.
	"How\'s she look, Wu-Shun?" 
	"Slicker than a stinkscrabbler\'s egg sacs, sir," came the cheery 
reply. "I just have to do some cooldown checks and make sure the crystals are 
okay, and then we can power up for jump again."
	"Great. Get on it." Grant changed channels, not waiting for an 
acknowledgement, knowing that Sanchez wouldn\'t have bothered anyway.
	"Tactical," came the booming, resonant voice over the speakers. 
	Grant sighed wearily. "Turn down your voxbox, O\'Connor," he muttered, 
"You\'re not impressing anyone."
	"As you wish, sir," replied a woman\'s sexy contralto.
	"Oh, very funny," Grant snapped. "Look, do you even have a setting on 
that thing for your own voice?"
	"Of course, sir," said a man\'s strong, thickly accented tenor. "But 
it\'s been so long since I lost my throat, I don\'t even remember what it sounds 
like."
	"Oh, tragedy," Kherkhoulloth sang from his station, "My heart erupts 
in a thousand bleeding holes at the very thought of it!"
	"I like you, Kherk," came the voice. "That\'s why I\'m not going to 
crush you like a rotten skymelon."
	"What\'s Tactical saying?" Grant interjected. "If you don\'t mind."
	"A lot of things, sir," O\'Connor replied. "We have ghosts of any 
number of things: interstellar hydrogen, artifacts from old stellar flareups, 
and we\'re not far from Suleiman\'s Oort cloud, so there are comets to deal with 
as well."
	"I reiterate," Grant said in a level tone. "What\'s Tactical saying?"
	"We\'re all alone, sir. No immediate risks."
	"THANK you, O\'Connor," Grant said. "Keep me posted if the deep scans 
come up with anything. We\'ll be out of here in an hour or less, but--"
	"Whoa!" O\'Connor interrupted him. "I have something here, sir!"
	"What is it?" Grant called up the Tactical display at his station, and 
Kherkhoulloth looked over at it curiously.
	"Metallic object. Don\'t know how I missed it on the first sweep; it\'s
big. Really big." 
	"Take it apart," Grant ordered. "Every scan we have."
	"I\'m on it, sir. Hector, arm and warm the main guns."
	"Main turrets armed and ready," came the imperturbable computer\'s 
voice. "Target select on unidentified object confirmed and tracking."
	"I want those scans, Daryavayush!"
	"You\'ve got them, sir," O\'Connor replied. "Up on the display."
	The holovid began streaming numbers across the vague, grainy outline 
of the distant object. Grant scanned them, reading aloud, as they went by.
	"Cold to almost the background level, no air, no life, little or no 
organics, no power sources, no radiation, volume echo versus densitometer 
indicating it\'s hollow, a ship of some kind. But totally dead." Grant shook 
his head. "Weird."
	"I vote we leave it alone and get out of here," Kherkhoulloth gulped.
	"Oh, no! We have to explore it! Let\'s get in closer and have a look!"
Grant and Kherkhoulloth turned as Jaeger stepped onto the bridge, vidcam in 
hand and rolling as he walked. He pointed the powerful camera to the heavens 
and looked about for the mysterious object. "I don\'t see it," he complained.
	"We\'re a good two hours\' trip from it," Grant said. "And I\'m not sure 
we want to get any closer."
	"It could be a trap," Kherkhoulloth suggested uneasily. "Let\'s jump!"
	"I recommend exploring it, sir," O\'Connor\'s voice chided. "This is a 
very strange occurrence, and I\'d hate to pass it up."
	"You wouldn\'t pass up a chance to get a nuke dropped on you, just to 
have the experience!" Kherkhoulloth snarled.
	"No," O\'Connor replied mildly. "I\'ve HAD nukes dropped on me before. 
How do you think I ended up looking like I do?"
	"Aegh," the Vargr muttered. "Sir, our ESCAPE course is laid in."
	"Thanks, Kherk. Plot a low-fuel loop for that...THING out there."
	"You\'re going to look at it?" Kherkhoulloth said disbelievingly. 
"WHY, for the Old Ones\' sake?"
	"Because it shouldn\'t be there," Grant said. "Other ships have 
disappeared in this region before. If it\'s a ship, it may be salvageable."
He smiled thinly at Kherkhoulloth. "You know, MONEY?"
	"Ah!" Kherkhoulloth nodded sagely. "That\'s one word I understand!"
	Grant smiled at that; if nothing else, the navigator was predictable 
in his unpredictability. He switched the intercom to all-ship. "Sanchez, can
you give us some maneuver power while running the jump prep?" 
	"Sure, but not once we start the charging sequence...."
	"Hold off on that," Grant said thoughtfully. "we\'ve got something to 
look at first." 
	Jaeger smiled at that. "A real, live ghost ship," he said happily. 
"The drama and pathos of a crew lost forever in space, the Flying Dutchman of 
the Solomani Rim. It\'ll make great copy for my next movie."
	"I\'m hoping it\'s a real DEAD ghost ship," O\'Connor said softly. "If 
it\'s alive and we can\'t tell that from here, this could be a very interesting 
trip, in all the wrong ways."
	"We\'re going," Grant said, taking the control stick. "Prepare for one 
point five gees."
	Kherkhoulloth slapped a hand to his forehead. "Why am I convinced that
we\'re going to regret this?"

||The two real obstacles are, I think, fairness and elegance.  Anyone can
||make an arbitrary decision that the NPC gets the first shot, and gets a
||hit.  I don\'t think anyone here does that to their players (with the
||rare exception of a player who is REALLY asking for it), so that\'s not
||too much of a problem.
||
||The peace-through-superior-firepower solution is one that I generally
||have to rely on.  You have to be careful, though; unless you simply want
||to make certain things totally off limits to a group of characters, you
||can only make your NPCs a little more powerful than they are.  (Yes,

The "PTSF" metheod can be used quite well, even without actually using it
but through threat.  In one 2300 session I wanted two of my players to get
captured by some anarchists so that they could get useful information out
of it.  One was a "mostly harmless" administrator/field agent with little
in the way of combat skills.  The other was a ground military/space military
(aka. ground pounder) type.  The big problem was that the GP player always
walked around in combat plate with an assult rifle.  So the session went
like this ("Mike" is the administrator, "Andy" is the military man, other
names are assorted characters and "Me" is my narration)
- ----
Me: Well, you spend the last 15 minutes putting the fuel in the cargo area
    of your tram when you hear a deep voice behind you say "Don\'t Move".

Mike: I put my hands up and turn around slowly.

Andy: I dive to the side and look at who it is.

Mike: Who doe sit look like?

Me:  A real big guy in rigid breastplate and inertial armor carying a
     12-81 magnum.

Andy: So, I have combat plate.

Mike: How can he carry that?  That can only be fired from a tripod?

Me: He\'s from King.

Mike: Oh.  Okay, we surrender.  Andy, put your gun down before you get killed.
- ----
With andy walking around armed and armored to the max, I needed a weapon that
could penetrate his armor.  A 12-81 is a VERY BIG GUN, about 1.5 meters long
that fires a 12mm by 81mm round.  In the 2300 armor system, a 1 DP gun can
penetrate 1 cm of steel.  Combat plate is rated at AV 1.  The 12-81 has a
penetration of DP 4.  True, it is NORMALLY only fired from a bipod mount.
So I made the guy come from King, a world where the people are DNA modified
to handle the 3 gees of gravity (Imagine a Jinxian, but of normal height).
Mike and Andy were sufficiently cowed so that I could have them brought before
the head anarchist so he could, like all good villians, leak some parts of
his plans to his helpless captives.  In the long run, this "spur of the moment"
character became a major thorn in the side of all the players.  I would
have loved to have him get away to be a future annoyance to them, but they
were too persistant in hunting him down later on and he bought it.

I guess things are just easier in the 2300 world to balance out tough PCs.
Even with the best armor, a shaped grenade or FTE-10 gaus sniper rifle will
still blow your head off, and no matter how many life points you have, a shot
to the head with a .22 pistol can still kill you if you are unarmored.

     In regard to Mark\'s question, ( by the way, thanks for the kind 
words, Mark ), I\'ve never let my players get to the point where they
were so powerful as some of the PCs everybody\'s been describing, but
I suspect that I keep a tighter rein on my players\' destructive impulses
than most referees.  I tend to run my games like Pete and Adrian described,
where the players can do pretty much what they want, as long as they 
don\'t mess with the Imperial authorities.  My players tend to be very
pro-Imperial anyway, trying to stay on the good side of the law.  
Remember The Traveller Adventure?  After discovering the meson gun plot,
their first impulse was to go to the Imperial authorities.  Loyal citizens,
all. Not that they aren\'t devious in their own ways, but they managed to
get on the good side of a certain naval intelligence officer and wanted
to stay that way.

     Enough digression.  One way I keep the PCs from getting too powerful
is to keep them relatively poor.  This works when they want to buy black
market arms and are charged many times the list price for them.  Making
high-tech weaponry hard to acquire ( ever try to find a high TL world
with a low enough law level to actually buy a laser rifle legally? )
is usually sufficient, and the PCs desire to advance themselves 
financially proves to be an excellent incentive to take those risky
jobs that PCs always seem to get...   And, like Paul said, combat 
skills aren\'t always the most useful.  "A Marine can do two things:
Kill, and wait around until he can kill some more." :-)

    Did anybody look at my fuel consumption idea?  It looks like it
will work for the 10 ton fighter, too. (Although the fighter needs a
bigger power plant )  Sigh.

As I promised, here is the awk script set that I wrote to postprocess the 
ASCII output from the program "ST" into [et]roff compatible input specification.
This will allow you to edit the information as you see fit and as well, add 
things to the information to make it more complete.   The star map is 
rendered in PIC format as well.   It probably could be greatly improved upon 
and I invite the programmers out there to hack away at it and come up with 
whatever improvements you can think of.   

The working script itself was written for the NAWK version of awk because of 
the ability to break the script up into modular units easier.  In fact it 
almost is like programming in C! 

Enjoy!

What is this program and why was it written?   When I recieved a copy of the 
program "st" I was suitably impressed with it.  However, being left with the 
choice of outputs of either text or postscript left a little to be desired.
I wanted to be able to add comments and such to the resultant output and then 
print all this information via eroff to my laser printer.  I even wanted the 
hex map for a subsector printed out as well.   

I began hacking at an awk script to do this for me, and the result after many 
hours of tweaking ended up being the product you see here.  To use the script
set you execute:

	do_map [seed number] > file 

	-or-

	do_map [seed_number] | pic  .... etc ....


Some of my own complaints about this script:

	1) Stars are not "shaded" in.   In the postscript output facility of 
	"st" the stars are filled in.   I liked that.  Unfortunately PIC has
	no way of doing this (boo hiss!).

	2) No facility flags in the hexes.   Maybe next release.

	3) Stars are not centered.   I don\'t know why.  Pic is being
	ostreporous about this.   


I wholeheartedly release this set of scripts to the public domain. I don\'t 
claim that they are "the end", and probably could be improved upon greatly.

WOMEN, ANDROIDS, AND MYSTERY
Another wierd posting by Cap\'n Paul


WOMEN
     Doesn\'t EVERYONE have female players and PC\'s running in their
games?  One of the best goups of players I can remember was the All
Girl Mount Holyoke Paranoia Campaign.  Not a single PC ever made it
it out of the briefing room.

ANDROIDS
     There are no androids in The Eight Worlds (as far as anyone
knows).  There are, however, robots.  Which robots are not terribly
intelligent.  It is an ancient piece of EW lore that self-awareness
is a simple programming trick which only takes about 32K of code,
while real intelligence, capable of abstract reasoning, common sense,
passing the Turing test, and all that stuff takes Truly Massive Amounts 
of computing power.
     As a result, all robots, be they simple tour guides or ancient
and powerful autonomous war machines left over from imperial days,
must be handled with care.  They have a tendancy to interpret commands
and data in an excessively literal fashion.  They have, in fact, a
tendancy to leap to conclusions.  Some models of robot have what can
only be described as personality flaws as well.  Such as the 
autonomous mining complex whose components had what to my mind was
a whimsical tendancy towards religious fanaticism.

MYSTERY
     It is easy to create mysteries for your players.  It is trivial.
It is the Very Simplest Thing In The Whole World.  Simply DON\'T TELL
THEM ANYTHING.  DON\'T TELL THEM ANYTHING AT ALL.  Rather than say,
"Two Pastagorian Death Commandos (PDCs) open fire from the third green
balcony on the left with their Canon SureShot short blasters!" say
"You see the flash of a laser bolt.  Morris Minor takes 32 points
of damage to his STR."  After the PDCs get shmeared, don\'t say,
"They were obviously sent by the Evil Prince Cormac."  instead say,
"You don\'t find any trace of identification, except for a claim check
for Carl\'s Dry Clean on Rastabad."
     The beauty of the Don\'t Tell Them Anything Approach (hereafter
referred to as DTTAA) is that it allows the GM to appear subtle and
clever without any effort.  In short, you can create great mysteries
by simply being lazy.

THE DTTAA AT WORK
     Consider the following example:
     The PC\'s land their corvette, the \'ANDROSCOGGIN\', at Rastabad 
spaceport.  On board is a valuable cargo of mirpins which they have 
been hired to carry to Bounders to relieve the mirpin shortage there.  
The Evil Prince Cormac (EPC) wants to stop this cargo from arriving 
because... well...  he\'s Evil.
     An energetic GM would now spend several hours creating the EPC\'s
army of minions.  Right down to the last min.  Which minions the PCs
would then blow away.  Down to the last min.  How dull.
     An even more energetic GM would Try To Create A Mystery.  He 
would devise a complex scenario, laden with trails and clues, which
the PCs would cleverly ignore in their rush to blow away the EPCs 
minions.  PCs are like that.  Impetuous fellows every one.
     A lazy GM applies DTTAA.  He does not bother to create any
minions.  He does not bother to plant a single clues.  He is, in fact,
completely unprepared.  In desperation, he throws two hapless PDCs at
the PCs.  To buy time, he furnishes one of the PDCs with a laundry
ticket.  This is surely plausible.  Even Pastagorian Death Commandos 
need to get their shirts cleaned.  ESPECIALLY Pastagorian Death 
Commandos.  Tomato sauce leaves such terrible stains.  It is the GM\'s 
fervent hope that the PLAYERS will generate some sort of mystery.  On
their own!  Players are, after all, quite good at this sort of thing.  
It is what they are for.  If left to their own devices, players can be 
relied upon to create such a terrible tangled mess that soon even the 
GM will lose track of what is happening.
     The players do not hunt down the EPC.  No, this is much too
obvious.  They conclude that the attack is the work of the New
Chinese Fleet.  The laundry ticket is a obviously a clue.  Everyone
KNOWS that the New Chinese control every dry-cleaning establishment 
from here to Boruski.  The New Chinese must be seeking to protect 
their mirpin monoploy.  The PCs break into the New Chinese Embassy.
     The Ambassadorian Cleaning Staff repells the attack with 
contemptuous ease, after which the New Chinese attempt to determine
the identity of their attackers.  The PCs have left no clues.  So
the GM consults his notes to discover that New China is currently at 
odds with the Sandulak Corporation.  Ah ha!  The plot thickens! 
Three New Chinese agents attempt to infiltrate the Sandulak Regional 
Headquarters.
     In no time at all, the NPCs are bustling about in a furor,
spying on each other, shooting each other, and conducting local
school board elections.  The PCs still have no idea what is going 
on.  Because:
     First, nothing IS going on.  There are NO grandiose plots and
conspiracies.  The NPCs have been stirred into frantic life by the 
PCs inept bumblings and are running around essentially at random.
     Second, the GM is lazy and DOESN\'T TELL THE PLAYERS ANYTHING AT 
ALL!  He does not say, "Well, today three Escargian Fetishists fell
seized a Sandulak cargo shuttle and crashed it into the Central
Repository."  he says, "You hear a distant explosion.  It is
doubtless a matter of small consequence."  If prompted the GM will
admit that yes, the landing pad next to the ANDROSCOGGIN is now 
empty.  And the PCs will receive a small surprise should they ever
decide to take a Central Repository Tour.
     At last, the players are forced to conclude that they are
lost.  They have stumbled into an incredible mystery, a conspiracy
of gargantuan proportions.  They are forced to conclude that their 
GM is a genius.  They show their admiration by fixing the GM up 
with dates.

My wife and I have rolled played with my wife on numerous occasion. My favorite
time being in TRAVELLER, where she was playing an Old money Countess and I was
an upstart nouveau-riche Knight. We did not get along and our bickering 
delighted the GM that was running us. 

Also I have run with women on many occasions and it has been a much more 
enjoyable experience. I was playing the Vargr in the Traveller adventure 
and the GM\'s wife was playing a well to do woman in the party and she in
real life is an Animal rights proponent, it was amazing the way the to of
us got along. I thought that we may have had a very "interesting" love story
but unfortunately the campaign broke up, so we never did get to find out
where that relationship would have ended up. 

If you have never roleplayed with women in the party try it sometime you will
like it.

First, Dan Corrin and I have come up with a questionnaire that we would
like everyone to fill out and return to Dan. This questionnaire is
intended to get a sampling of the various randes of expertise in
the discussion group, and to get a gist of what everyone would like
to see in the first build of our system, intermediate builds,
and the finished product. We would appreciate you getting it back to 
Dan <dan@engrg.uwo.ca> at your earliest convenience.

Subject: Another (should be) hot topic: data formats
To: METLAY@vms.cis.pitt.edu, burdick@hpindl1.hp.com, dan@engrg.uwo.ca,

Here\'s something that we\'ve hinted at but haven\'t discussed: how are
we going to store input, transient, and output data? Now I know that
according to standard software engineering techniques we don\'t need to
define this for a while yet, it could influence our design if we specify
all data to be stored in ASCII format, for example.

I think that it should be required that we store all data in ASCII format. 
This will allow the referee generating the systems to massage the data
in any way deemed necessary to get the desired results. They just pull
the data file into their favorite editor and in a few minutes, they are
ready to go. However, this dramatically increases the amount of data
validation we must do since we can\'t guarantee data integrity anymore.

For my information, what data formats have been used to store data
in existing programs? I would guess that most programs would use
binary (flags, numbers, enumerated types, etc) and records. Both of
which would be hard to edit with a debugger and just about
impossible with anything else. I would also hazard a guess that a
majority of our end users will use this/these programs on PCs,
Macs, etc.

Now for the standard questions: what do you think? What is a better
way of doing it that will still allow users to edit data files by
hand? Do we even *want* users to edit [transient] data files?

By \'transient\' I mean both data files that exist only during the
operation of the system *and* those data files used between
modules (eg. output from one module is used as input to another).

- --Bill

PS- I thought of a \'edit data files\' program, but we don\'t know all
    of the data files we\'ll need yet, and ASCII data files nicely
    side-steps the problem of having a potentially huge and
    intelligent data file editor.

There are really only two choices I can think of, ASCII and binary. There
are advantages and disadvantages to each.
ASCII is easy to read, store, and can be modified easily.
it is also bulky, and data verification code will have to be added to 
each module.
Binary is compact, has better data integrity, and requires less code.
it is difficult to change (ie. requires a special editor), highly
susceptible to data damage, and difficult to read.

The real trade off is space vs. difficulty to access. ASCII takes more
space (both code and data storage), and binary is difficult to use.

I believe that data files used between modules (which we haven\'t actually
decided on using), should be the same format as the input and output files,
as that is essentially what they are. The temporary files (if any), should
be left up to the programmer, I can\'t think of any reason (at this time),
why people would need access to them, come to think of it I can\'t think of
any reason to use them at all.

	That\'s my opinion.

I would be more in favor of this type of methodology PROVIDED THAT THE 
DATA TYPES AND STRUCTURES ARE THOROUGHLY DOCUMENTED.  Also, great care 
must be taken to ensure backward compatibility in the event that future 
revs cause these structures to change.  (Some type of header info that 
tells which rev the records were written with.)

A data files editor doesn\'t need to be huge.   In fact if modularity is 
maintained, the editor could be built up from the same routines that 
write and read the data from the "main" programs.

OK so I did.   I boy am I glad!   Hey Gang!  There is gold in them 
thar\' hills!

I have in my possesion now a copy of a document written by a "Stan Shebs" 
that outlines some salient points that we should consider.   I took the 
time to convert this document from whatever-in-the-sam-hill format it was 
in into [ent]roff format.  The title of this document is "Simulating the 
Universe" and when formatted on my machine turned out to be 11 pages long.
It makes good reading.   

If anybody is interested in getting a copy of my "hacked" version, give 
me a good UUCP path and I will send it to you.

Other goodies I got from there include a program that uses rules rather 
different than Traveller\'s rules to generate star systems.   Some of its 
feature sets might be useable for this project tho\'.  Planetary resources 
are figured out, as well as surface temps, seasonal effects from axial 
tilt, and a lot of other details.

I haven\'t finished evaluating all of the goodies that I glommed from 
there, but I think that these should not be overlooked.

Yes I agree, however I was not discussing changing the star generation
process (which I would have left on the star generation list), rather coming
up with a reason for the generation as listed. I did want a sub table to
generate other stellar phenomanon used perhaps once or twice per sector.
The rules (scouts) even mention adding supergiants in at a very low density
(1 per sector or so).

My main points are/were:
1) Stars not represented correctly (2D, too many non-dwarf, no black holes.)
a) Assume all stars are projected into a plane. to get 2D board
b) a large number of stars are not mapped (usualy dwarfs) because of no
bodies in the system for bases/fuel.
c) Resultant stars provide density and composition we get from the star
generation tables. (I have a good reason for 2D as well which I haven\'t
brought up).
d) Add in other interesting stellar objects at a rate of a few per sector
(I like a lot of black holes myself...but see first paragraph).
e) this results in no changes to the maps (execpt where you want to mark
other stellar objects), nor to any rules, it is just a method of
perceiving the traveller universe so that it approximates ours more closely
(after all we have already assumed a 2D universe)

2) Obervation techniques don\'t seem to match today\'s standards.
a) Correct me if I\'m wrong as I havn\'t dug up my Zhodani alien module, but
I believe that in the core exploration rules, you only get to see an
area 2-3 parsecs ahead of you. 
b) if you subscribe to (1) above, identifying good stars may that difficult.
c) if not, (I was probably exaggerating when I said we could see the entire
imperium from one location.) but even the near star map at 50 ly radius
represents a circle with a 30 parsec diameter, which is approximately a
sector (24x40 parsecs). That is with tech 8 ground based telescopes, a 
good TL 15 scout in space with no light noise sould get at least 4 sectors. 
(double range) 
d) additionaly as an jump-capable observer can more easily calulate 
positions by virtue of being able to observe from different points (from 
Leonard)

Just a few minor changes (and adding relion question, I find that
some people are touchy about religion in games).
Is there a reason why the industrialization index was not carried over? It
doesn\'t really matter, as I think it is a bit to picky of a detail. However
I just thought of another statistic that our governemnts use: %urban pop.
This can actually be calculated from the city generation sequence in
WBH, but might me interesting as a quick statistic.
(There are also other fun statistics that are used today such as infant
mortality, literacy rate, etc. These, though are kinda much.).

I will let you send it out, I will compare the answers and post the results

the questionaire out as part of the introductory message.

Do you know that a range of 1-10, being even has no middle or "average" 
answer? (which is one reason why I chose -5 to 5, which has problems too).

The time in the where to respond is flexible, but if not given, the results

  If Build 1 is one program that generates strict Traveller/MegaTraveller
  systems, what do you envision Build 2 as being (eg. more functions
  to build 1, a planetary information generator taking input from
  the build 1 program, a trade/X-boat route generator taking input
  from build 1, etc)?

  How should we represent the (as yet unkown) data types?
  [Binary/Record | ASCII] [Single File | Multiple Files]

  Should our production system be one program or a series of programs?
  If a series of programs, how should we break them up (physical, political,
  scale [sector, subsector, system, planet], other)?

  What co-ordinate system should we use for sector numbering?
  [Reference|Galaxy Centre|Other]

  Should we include some data items used by other gaming systems
  (E.g. Galactic Conquest, Exploting Space, Other Suns, and Space Opera)?
  
  Should we include religion generation (for example from the world builders 
  handbook), as this may be offensive to some?

   Should the first build be one program generating strict (only
   information currently in Traveller/MT/World Builder) systems (This

   "real" system generator or James Perkins\' system generator as a
   *framework* around which to build our system (This means re-writing
   some of the code in those systems to conform to our deign)?

   If we use either of these systems, should their capabilities by
   included in build 1 or in subsequent builds?

   Should the first build be one program unto itself, or should we
   begin with our \'series of program\' from the start?
   
   How much control over the random generation do we want the user to
   have (UPP(system) level, stellar level, planet level, or more)?


   Compatibility Considerations

    played clasical and Mega.  Right now, I\'m mainly interested in
    MegaTraveller, and have a friend who also plays, but has no net access
    at this point.  I haven\'t been very active due to other games I am
    concentrating on, but I am interested.

    I think we should go for at least sector and subsector maps probably
    solarsystem and planetary info.  As to planetary maps and city maps, it
    is something that should be open to talk, but not a main thrust.  It
    would take up too much time.  I cannot really comment on any more,
    because I haven\'t really done much in Traveller, nor have I had a

To: morrison@agora.hf.intel.com

I\'m mailing a copy of this to both dan@engrg.uwo.com and
morrison@pyr.gatech.edu, so you\'ll both know what\'s happening.

After filling out the questionaire Friday, I went out to
my favorite spot, the airport (I\'m a student pilot).  While
there, I picked up a little (it really is little, but thick)
book, called the "Flight Guide".

This book is organized by states (U.S. states), and for each
state it contains a sketch of *every* airport (well every one
anyone but a crazy bush pilot would want to land at) and information
about that airport.

The information includes: distance and direction to town, length of
runway(s), width of runway(s), type of surface, fuel available, 
services, latitude, longitude, field elevation, known non-obvious
hazards, a telephone number to call, and so forth.

It occured to me that this type of book would be essential to any
shuttle or starship pilot.  

Do we want to consider something along these lines?  If so, I can provide
more information.  (I don\'t limit the concept to just starports,
I envision the concept could apply equally well to a larger-scale
concept like a subsector - less detailed).

Thanks for listening.

Just a thought here:

The two programs that I have already for star system generation give their 
output in the form of either strictly ASCII flat files or POSTSCRIPT files.
Another option we might want to consider would be [txe]roff files.  Hex 
maps could easily be generated by PIC formatter input files, and as well you 
would be able to merge the textual information about a subsector with the 
graphics.   I have already been experimenting along those lines very 
successfully, and it wouldn\'t be too hard to do.

feel free to repost.  I would have sent it to the list, but I lost the 
address.  (Actually, I lost the machine that had the address on it... 
long story.) I would also be very inyterested in joining the star system 
generation group.  It is one of my two vices in traveller.  The other is 
automated ship generation programs that do deck plans.  That one I have 
not yet figured out a good way to deal with, but I will hack away till

Hello.  I heard a rumor that we now have a reliable way to get to your host.
The excitement of it all...

First off, I have a few opinions on what a good generator system should do:
I think we should stick to the MT/WBH format whenever and wherever possible.
This would maximize the number of people who can use the final product.

  I would not mind a series of three programs:

Sector or Subsector level - shoudl produce output comparable to one of 
the MT sector maps.  If we can come up with an easy 3D fix, I certainly 
would not mind it, as long as it is reasonably easy to implement.  By 
this, I mean that I should be able to alter all of the relevant portions 
of the rules and explain them to my players in under ten minutes if they 
are familiar with MT.  I should also be able to use a standard MT map with 
a little pre-game re-ordering.

  A possible way to do this would be to assign tenth or fifth 
parsec height numbers and make them an optional pre or postfix part of the 
system hex number.  Example: hex 0203 is jump one away from hex 0204; hex 
010101 is one jump away from 110101.  If a tenth is unreasonable, then 
perhaps a half or whole hex.  Merely making the average distance stay the
same does not account for the fact that one has access to another dimension
and thus one may have more or fewer worlds that form a contigous trade route.
The beauty of the pre/postfix on the hex number is that it can be freely
ignored if needed.  I would expect that this program keeps track of worlds
by hex number, with or without extensions.

  This program should be able to work from information already generated if 
the need arises.  It might behoove us to type in a copy a significant chunk 
of the spinward marches just so we can insure that our program\'s output looks
like the reference standard.

  System level - Should be able to produce a World Builder\'s handbook type 
of description of any system needed.  It gives each world in a system a
number, perhaps by orbit number and sattelite number, while remembering
that overall system by the same hex number we just finished taliking about
above.  We should really get decent system maps with some kind of reasonable
(log ?) scale lurking about in them.  This too should be able to work 
from a upp or some other input data.

  Planetary level - I often need this one.  A combination of reality and the
world builder stuff would be nice here.  I never have enough maps of planets 
hand, so this would be very handy.  It should probably use the sector hex
number along with the system orbit and sattelite orbit number to keep track
of where everything is.  One should be able to feed in a upp for system
and planet and get a reasonable map out that takes into account all of the
data in its map.  This one needs some flags in it that allow the user
to ask for certain parameters to be altered, like tectonic activity,
desired trade paramters, population density (clumped or distributed), and
other such.

  This is what I find that I would use, and would very much like to have.

The generation programs should be able to print out any given piece of this
data (like a subsectors worth at any given moment) as needed.

  By the way, I work on Apple //gses and Macs for the most part, though I
test-copile everything on out Sequent to make sure it works before I go
through the aches and pains of porting all of this to my computers.
For example, while the gensys programs have worked, the program that was to 
generate realistic planets has not yet our system, mostly because the links
to our site clipped everything faithfully at 80 characters.

  Background:
BS physics, working on a Masters in Applied Math.  Prgrammed in basic for
8 years, Pascal for 6, C for 1.  I have worked VMS, Unix, Macs and GSes.
I tend to be very good at finding bugs, not nearly as good at fixing them.
If you all are working on a project, I will be happy to give an opinon as a
dedicated rules fiend, but I don\'t know how much time I can devote to 
programming yet.

To: traveller@dadla.wr.tek.com

    Most of you seem to be discussing things over my head. Literially.
I am not so much concerned with generating huge number of stars but things
of planet sized and lower.
    The reccomended grid for worlds looks something like this:

               /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\
              /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\      I.e. a 20 sided dice.
             /____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\
            /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /
           /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /
          /____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\/____\\/
          \\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /
           \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /
            \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/

    You put hexes down the sides (one for each size of the world gives
you a constant scale) and pentegrams on the corners. This is really peachy
and plesant but has several drawbacks if you want to try to implement this
on a computer (If you don\'t trust me, I leave it as an exercise).
    Firstly I will outline what is needed for a computer representation:
    1) There must be a simple way to thread the sphere. I.e. we must easialy
be able to visit every point once and only once.
    2) We must be able to find all represented points withing a certain
radius of our subject point. E.g. I need all nodes within two of this one.
    3) We must be able to trace a diameter in a small number of cardinal
directions eventually reaching our starting point.
    4) It must be recursively definable. I.e. we must be able to increase
the resolution infinately.

    So what do we do?
    Hexes are nice, traditional and great for flat surfaces but a bit of a
bollox when you hit the corners. I think triangles are out best bet. Lets
work through the criteria in reverse order.
    (4) Recursively definable:
       /\\               /\\               /\\
      /  \\             /  \\             /8_\\
     /    \\           / 2  \\           /\\2 /\\
    /      \\   ==>   /______\\    ==>  /9_\\/10\\  ==> ...
   /        \\       /\\      /\\       /\\7 /\\6 /\\
  /    1     \\     /  \\ 1  /  \\     /11\\/1_\\/14\\
 /            \\   / 3  \\  / 4  \\   /\\3 /\\5 /\\4 /\\
/______________\\ /______\\/______\\ /12\\/13\\/15\\/16\\    no problem.
    (3) diameter.
    Always stand in a triangle with our backs to a base. If we go through
the left face, then with our back to that in the new triange go through the
right face repeatedly we will circumnavagate the sphere. Choosing which
base and wether to go left or right first gives us six directions.
    (2) find all points within a radius
    If you assume that an adjacent triangle is a triangle sharing
a base you have no problem and minimal difficulty on corners. A more
attractive way is to have any triangle which shares a vertex be one
unit away. This has rather more difficulties.
    (1) threading the sphere.
    I haven\'t been able to come up with an algorithmical way to do this.
It is, of course, trivial if one numerically orders the triangles. This
brings us to my mental block. To come up with a numbering system for
the triangles of the sphere that caters for the conditions above.
    What this boils down to is that the above scheme is mathematically
elegant it needs four things to make it usefull. (4) a way of uniquely 
identifying {preferably with an integer, or ordered pair} each triangle
element on the sphere. This numbering system must remain compatible as
the resolution is increased. (3) A function that when given a location
id and a direction, returns a location id of the next triangle along 
that diameter. (2) A function that is passed a location and returns
a fixed number of locations distance one from the given location. (1)
A function that given a locations returns another location such that
if continually called with the return value it will cycle through all
locations before returning.
    Is there a fresh mind out there that can see what I can\'t?

James, if this meets your approval, please pass it on to the rest of the 
group.

Phew!  I just read (skimmed) the discussion on mapping.  A few comments and
suggestions that may be of some help...

3D mapping is easy if you add a calculation subroutine to determine 
distances between stars of different "z" levels.  In fact, both 2D and 3D 
maps might be better if there was a table (like in modern road atlases) 
that show how far in jumps or hyperdrive days or whatever different people 
use different stars are from each other.  Equally easy would be adding a 
star type generator that would not only determine the location, but the 
main sequence stellar type (using percentages...01-73: M; 74-88: K; 89-95: 
G; 96-98: F, 99: A; 00: other (black hole, supergiant, whatever your little
heart desires)--actually A-type stars make up only about .6% of the main 
sequence, and white dwarves make up about 5% of all stars, but people can 
modify the system as they please.)

By the way, for realism fans who are afraid M-type stars offer nothing for
gamers...GOOD NEWS.  Remember, M-type stars are just as likely to have
planets as G-type stars, and even if most of them are Neptune-like gas 
giants, big deal?  Remember our discussion of space habitats, each one a
floating city with a million people, clustered in nations of a billion 
people or more.  Gas giants have giant moons for raw materials (okay, okay,
I know a lot of it will be water ice, think of it as "panning for gold" on
a big scale) and lots of hydrogen to fuel fusion power plants.  And 
asteroid belts have high quality raw materials in great abundance and 
easy access.  The average solar system can have several hundred "worlds,"
each one consisting of a network of a hundreds of space cities--tens or
hundreds of billions of NPCs who need the help (or are asking to get killed
by) your player characters!

(By the way "a hundreds of" should read "hundreds of"--I apologize for being
such a bad typist)

Dear Bill; Jim Perkins suggested I contact you about my interest in a
simple yet compatible data format for TRAVELLER Sector files.  I know of
Marc Miller\'s format that was published in Challenge, and note that the
extensive data files from GDW/DGP uploaded to GENIE add a chunk of ASCII
in the front for the system names, wasting a batch of space because most
systems are unnamed.  Are you aware of any evolving formats that would save
me the embarassment of building an avoidably non-standard program?  I am 
working in the PC-XT environment with sequential ASCII records that are

Bill- I would love to join the discussion.  I vote strongly for ASCII, and
suggest excluding hi-eighth bit and non-printing characters. It is key that
any sophisticated work product be accessible to those with simple machines,
such as Commodore 64s and Apple IIs.  I think the databases are best if 
readable (and revisable) by hand with a simple editor, which argues strongly
for a sequential not random file that can function without indexes.  What 
those of us with more sophistication wish to do (build indexes, relational 
lists, graphic front ends etc) is fine, so long as the building blocks we
start with don\'t require any particular form of display, CPU or programming

  Last year, I was running a rather neat MT game based very loosely on
the Twighlight\'s peak scenario.  It was rather neat, but since the end of the
year (and graduation) was heading our way, we decided to end it.  I tweaked
the ending a bit (lots!) so that the players were the only people aware
of the incoming Zho fleet.  (I forgot that there is no reason for the
Zhodani to attack in the shattered imperium environment.  Sigh)

  On the plus side, I gave them the ancient base, chock full of obedient
warriors.  Logic: the warriors really did not want to die, but could
not justify thier continued existence without an appropriate leader
caste & droyne society.  The players knew of the chirpers, and the
droyne warrior caste leader was a bit unhinged, so he decided that they would
cleanse the planet of pollutants, bring in many chirpers, a few droyne
from elsewhere, and start a new band of Ancients.  Obviously, this
is not the most sane plan, but the leader was not the most sane of creatures.

  The disadvantage was that the players had to pretend to fit into the droyne
caste system, or the leader would happily disintegrate them as "unfit."

  The players wished to 1. repel the Zhodani invasion
  2. prevent a similar one from happening again
  3. get heaps and piles of money
  4. duplicate the resources of the base far away for thier own use.

  Thier methods for 1 and 2 were a bit crude, but effective.  
(artificial plague)  In the time we had left, they did not figure out a way
to do #4, so they did not get around to trying 3.

  Here is a case where a squadron of Tigress class ships couldn\'t do a damn
thing to them, but simple desire for human contact would get them in the end.
After all, the base was very immobile, and the droyne did not understand its
construction.  If they wanted to see people again, they would have to leave
it.  They might not be allowed back, either.  I was pleased.

Thanks to all for their responses to my earlier comments.  I was inspired
while reading them by the remark someone made about their idea for fuel
consumption for spacecraft.  Ah yes, fighters do require more power for
their weapons.  I learned this the hard way.  Although GDW has kindly
provided us with ship design systems and a supplement or three of "common
[Dspacecraft," and although I inherited an additional system from a friend
(now ex-friend, but that\'s another story), I foolishly decided to tinker
together a "realistic" spacecraft design system.

Does the word "mistake" mean anything to you?

Actually, it has turned out pretty well.  My system probably has errors in
it that would send engineers into hysterics, but most people find it (a)
plausible and (b) roughly playable (with a little practice, you can design
just about anything you could ever want, and you get a lot of detail about
what is actually on your spacecraft).  (The reason it is plausible is that
I annnoyed all my engineer questions with stupid questions about how much
things mass, and what kind of thrust-weight ratios do you get with certain
kinds of engine, etc.  There are still errors, but a lot less than in a lot
of other systems; I guess I\'ll have to be satisfied with that.)

Incidently, for those of you who are curious, power requirements for normal
spacecraft (including life support, power for computers, sensors, etc.) is
about ten kilowatts per ton of spacecraft--actually, I use something called
Power Units, which are about ten kilowatts each; it makes it easier to handle
the bookkeeping--but the moment you go to armed spacecraft (except for
things like missiles which only require a little power to magnetically
accelerate them out of a launching catapult), your power requirements go
through the roof.  An armed spacecraft will probably end up using something
like forty or fifty times the power of an unarmed spacecraft of the same
general size.  This is one of the reasons why they are so expensive.

By the way, some good books on the subject of spacecraft design include
FUTURE MAGIC, by Robert Forward, and especially THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT by
Dean Ing (Ing is not only a good writer, but he provides a bibliography
of his technical sources, something which many so-called science writers
leave out).  One of his chapters even has a couple of "story ideas" that
might make good Traveller adventures.

Well, take care all.

Ok, folks.  Here\'s a fun one:

One of my players, seeing a Frankiln Mint ad in TV guide for a USS Enterprise
model, asks how the "E" compares to common Traveller ships in terms of size.

The ad states that the "E" has a displacement weight of 190,000 tons.  Is that
the same unit of measure used for Traveller ships?  Anyone want to compare
Apples & Oranges?

With regards to the post about the ad for a Franklin Mint USS Enterprise

I\'m not too sure about the exact tonnage of the Enterprise (any version)
But one day, I was perusing the model section of a Toys R Us store
and they had models for the Kirk-blinking lights era, the movie era, and
the new generation era.  They even had one kit with all three!  Now thats
a lot of plastic!  Of course, myself having a colander mind, and this shopping
trip being about a month or so ago, I dont remember any specs on the boxes.

I do remember that the scale of the new generation model was 1/2500.
and the model i guess would be about 2 feet long. maybe more, the box was
pretty hefty.

A few notes that might be helpful....

Displacement = mass in tons (since you are "displacing" that many tons in
water).  The space shuttle masses about 78 tons empty (it is supposed to
be about the size and weight as a DC-9) and can carry about 23 tons of 
cargo to LEO.  

By Traveller standards, and by modern Earth standards, the Enterprise is,
pardon my language, fucking huge.  A few modern Earth ships, to put it in
scale...

Broadsword (NATO) frigate  3,500 tons (4,400 full load)
Los Angeles class attack submarine 6,900 tons (dived)
Nimitz class aircraft carrier 91,000 tons (full load)

USS Enterprise is supposed to be 190,000 tons...that\'s two Nimitz class
carriers.  Since the Enterprise does not have to dedicate so much of its
internal space and mass to flight hangers, maintenance equipment, etc., 
it might be better to call her 4 Iowa class battlships (they\'re about
45,000 tons, as I recall).

By the way, using the 6,000-man crew of the Nimitz as a rough measure,
the Enterprise uses only about five percent of the man/kiloton ratio of
modern naval vessels.  Now that\'s what I call impressive automaintenance!

   Take care, all.

>Displacement = mass in tons (since you are "displacing" that many tons in

Displacement is measured in tons of *water* for modern day naval vessels,
but in Traveller, displacement (High Guard "displacement" and MegaTraveller
UCP code) is measured in tons of *hydrogen* displaced.  The two scales are
*very* dissimilar, as water masses 9 times as much as hydrogen (MW H2 is
roughly 2 g/mol; MW H20 is about 18.1 g/mol)....

>Broadsword (NATO) frigate  3,500 tons (4,400 full load)

* 9 = 39,600 tons of hydrogen

>Los Angeles class attack submarine 6,900 tons (dived)

* 9 = 62,100 tons of hydrogen

>Nimitz class aircraft carrier 91,000 tons (full load)

* 9 = 819,000 tons of hydrogen

Well... it might be better still to call her three Los Angeles-class subs.
However, as you can see, ships today come out much heavier in Traveller 
"tons" than their size would seem to indicate.  The reason is that "classic" 
Traveller displacement calculations were based on pure volume rather than 
actual hydrogen displacement.  If you want an *accurate* comparison between,
say, the NIMITZ, the ENTERPRISE, and the AZHANTI HIGH LIGHTNING, take the
deck plans of all three ships and convert their respective volumes into
kiloliters.  One traditional Traveller "ton" in the sense you\'re used to 
thinking about it is the equivalent of 13.5 kiloliters.  

The ENTERPRISE is *NOT* twice the size of the NIMITZ.  If you want a very
simple argument for this, take the LOA, beam, and "draft" (extended from the
keel to the flight deck for the NIMITZ and from the bottom of the secondary
hull to the top of the warp engines for the ENTERPRISE) of both ships, then
consider that the NIMITZ is almost a monolithic block (configuration 4)
whereas the ENTERPRISE is a dispersed structure (configuration 7)....

	Well, actully Enterprise is not that big, I mean it\'s only 190,000 ton
in displacement. Most Battleship in MegaTraveller is at least equal or bigger.
Take Imperial Voroshilef Class Battleship for example, the displacement
is 200,000 ton. And yes, as Mark stated. The unit in MegaTraveller/Traveller
and modern Navy is the same.

On the contrary - there is no reason for the Zhodani NOT to attack the Spinward
Marches.  Who\'s going to stop them?  Throw out the "official" explanation.  As
I recall, it was something like "they no longer regard the Marches as a threat,
and are content to let it be".  Now, out of five Frontier Wars, how many did
the Zhodani start?  How many did the Imperium start?  5 - 0 to the Zhodani, if
my history books are reliable.  So who\'s threatening whom?  (I have my own
reason for the Zhodani not bothering the Marches.  It involves another Vargr
warlord, who\'s managed to combine TL 16 and population level 10, and isn\'t too
fond of Zhodani.)

Maybe not.  But if the players started getting obnoxious, one Tigress class
with a chirper on board might.  The Imperials have figured out what\'s happening
and sent this chirper along, with instructions to pretend to be a leader.
Either there\'s a gun secretly pointed at him; or the rest of the squadron is
threatening his home village; or he\'s been promised loadsamoney or loads of
Ancient goodies in return.  So he gets on the communicators, and tells the
Droyne that he\'s a leader, the PC\'s are evil alien invaders, and as of now he
is taking charge.

MEGATRAVELLER SHIPS & VEHICLES  (C)BKKJ89

(Note: Some of these designs are loosely based on old GDW designs that
 appeared in \'Traveller\' \'MegaTraveller: Imperial Encyclopedia\' 
 \'Fighting Ships\' och \'Alien Module: Vargr\'.  This will be noted where
 applicable.)

"Traveller" & "MegaTraveller" are GDW Trademarks.

Notes on notation: Some notation is of my own devising. Most notably the
 fractional lifesupport and FuelPurificationPlant times:
 In several cases I have cut down on lifesupport ( & gravitics) for non-
 essential parts of the ship, in order to save power and volume. This isn\'t 
 standard practice (in ship design) and it tend to make certain repairs more
 difficult to perform inflight. Most of these designs, however, are so close
 to their performance limits that I think that this practice is economic.
 FPP times are the time (in hours) it takes to purify the full volume of the
 ships fueltanks. The danger in this case is that you can\'t jump until you
 have enough fuel purifyed (or else risk a misjump). The manuverdrives in
 every case demands so little fuel per timeunit so the purification pnalt can
 keep equal to the demand (even though it might have to operate around-the-
 clock.
   
One deviation from the rules that I know I\'m guilty of is using the HighGuard
version of \'Space taken up by subordinate crafts\' instead of the MegaT version.
The old version was: This does not apply if the carrier is < 1000 tons!
I have assumed that the 1.5 modifyer enables almost any sort of subordinate
craft to be carries, regardless of shape, as long as the tonnage is right.
In all cases below are the smallcraft bays considered to be designed for
subcrafts of the listed type and, thus, not require any large additional volume

Feel free to mail if you have any questions or if you find any traces of
Swedish in the ships data (I originally wrote this in Swedish but I hope that
I have found and translated everything :-)

	The Merc-cruiser is a reworking of the Type C from \'Encyclopedia\' to
 	allow for (at least) some heavy weapons. It is mostly used by well
	equipped Merc forces because of its higher operating costs.
	Some ships are rumored to be working as pirates in corridor but
	nothing specific is known. While it is relatively easy to disguise
	the laser-/energyturrets as missileturrets (as the \'Old\' Type C) it is
	hard to disguise the powerplant signature.
	(Even though, at least the old \'Beltstrike\' stated that it was 
	possible to run the powerplant on a fraction of its output. I\'m not
	sure if this is the case in MegaT.)

	The Gunned Merchant (as it\'s official name is) is a ship that is
	peculiar to \'The Claw\' (Spinward, Deneb, Corridor). They first started
	to appear a few months after the beginning of the Vargr incursions in
	Corridor. The first ships was just converted SubLiners (Type M) but 
	the designbueros immediately catched on and the first purpose built 
        Gunned Merchants appeared as fast as they could be built. It is said
	that major reason for their success is that their concentrated
	missile salvoes are big enough to inflict major structural damage to
	the most common types of small pirates & corsairs.
	The name is under debate: Forces in the claw have always called this
	ship a Corridor Liner (Type RP) but the ones that have reached Ziru-
	Siirka (sp?) and the other fractions have been reclassifyed as
	Gunned Merchants (Type MG).
	A few is operated as combined decoys/piratehunters.
	The reaction by the Vargr has been that the Corsairs are starting to
	fly in groups (Wolfpacks :-) of two to five vessels.

	This is a standard orbital assault ship used by the Imperial Marines
	Commandos. It has the advantage visavis the dropcapsules in the fact
	that it provides both a way up again as well as close air support.
	Taking a gravvehicle down to surface in one of these has the advantage
	of speed. It is faster to put the pedal to the metal down and deploy
	the gravtank in the low atmosphere that to let the gravtank \'sail\'

	As opposed to the Type T in the \'Encyclopedia\' this design actually 
	works for piracy supression. The lasers are strong enough to inflict 
	criticals on the common corsair ships. This variant is mostly
	encountered when on distinct search&destroy missions against pirate
	ships and bases. The \'Encyclopedia\' versions are mostly used for 
	system security etc. There is no major external difference between
	this ship and the standard Type T.

	The only visible change on the outside (Except for the big IMC logos)
	is that that the central body is widened and has two hatches for
	the Dropships on the bottom. They are placed paralelly along the hulls
	long axis. Double occupancy is normal procedure for the whole crew

	fighters and harass shipping. On the outside it is recognizable by the
	enlarged fuelscopes on the leading edge of the \'wings\'. The Type TF
	commonly uses nuke missiles (75% conventional 25% nuke).

All vargr ships are based on designs from \'Alien Module: Vargr\'. They were 
modifyed in the process of converting them to MegaT.

	Cheap n dirty ship for Vargr Belters and others who don\'t care that
	the Air-regenerators smells mouldy. These ships are always sold at
	a price that is 1D * 5% lower than the listed value (The listed value 
	represents the value of a imperial-standard version of the Vargr
        Seeker). The lower the price, the lower the quality. If bought second-
        hand they might be the cheapest ships in Charted Space.
	Nothing about these ships is \'Standard\' but in most cases they come 
	equipped with extra external lights and a big workbay, just like
	imperial seekers. Some versions do away with the inertial plates and
	some don\'t have any interior grav at all.

	This is the infamous Vargr Corsair, the sight of which will make 
	Imperial merchants from Spinward to Vland shudder. It packs the same
	disguisemeasures as the \'Imperial\' Corsair but is heavily overloaded
	and underfueled. The fuelproblem is solved a complex procedure of 
	collapsible tanks and fuel trasnfers. At the start of the journey the
	Type VP has it\'s tanks filled and the Cutters open modules filled
	with 810tons in collapsible tanks. After the jump (but still in jump-
	space) this fuel is transferred to the main tanks and the collapsibles
	collapsed and stored. After reentry the Corsair refuels and begin
	hunting. As the fuel is consumed the space available in the open
	modules is taken up by loot. The voyage is ended by using the last
	fuel to jump home to a convenient gasgiant.

More varaint rules, very different from trav ship construction but in
spired by the original rules.  Computer programs to do this and much more
comming.

Designed to work with any machine like object (tank, robot and so on).
Missiles are considered to be small starships.


COSMOS Starship Components

These are the building blocks for cosmos ships from about tech level 8
to about tech level 30.  Past 30 "starships" are a quaint oddity.

Basic Parameters
- ----
ln: logrithm base e

TL: Incremental measurement of technological level that constructed the 
    object.

Fuss: Fusion technology.

E-to-M: Direct energy-to-matter technology.

Emass: The objects (vessels) mass devoted to energy production.

Eunits: the total energy units available to the vessel.
        Eunits = ln(TL-8) * Emass

Ecur-units: the number of energy units currently allocated to an objects
	    effect.  It is the division of Eunits to various ship systems.

FEFmass: mass for Eunits of fusion and partial fusion/E-to-M energy units
	 FEFmass = Emass * 40/ln(TL)**2

INTcomp: The current or dedicated intelligence of the computer for this
	 effect (of the object)

PSI: Psionic base of the computer system.
PSS: Psionic strength of the computer system.
PSR: Psionic resistance of the computer system.
PNERV: Computer primary nervous system (like humanoid STR).
SNERV: Computer secondary nervous system (like humanoid DEX).

     See Characteristics for further definition.  There will be a set
     of these for *each* computer system.

BSM: basic total ship mass.

TSM: the total ship mass including the cargo.

DENS: density of the ship in percentage.
- ----
Combat parameters

OCV: offensive combat rating of the object as related to starship combat.

      INTcomp can be derived from a dedicated computer system (for offensive
      systems) or have shared intelligence with a multi-purpose system (see
      discussion on computers).

OCVmass: mass of offensive combat system

     OCVmass = ln(TL-7) * 7 / TL
     OCVbase = INTcomp * ln(TL-7)
     OCV = INTcomp * ln(TL-7) + Ecur-units + Weapons-systems-skills +
	   Tactical skills

ORM: offensive range modifier.
     short range: 0 <= range <= 100*OCV (current OCV is multiplied X 2)
     mid range:   100 <= range <= 10000*OCV (current OCV is multiplied X 1)
     long range: 10000 <= range <= 100000*OCV (current OCV is multiplied X .5)

ODV: offensive damage delivered by the weapon system.

ODVprox: proximity damage by exploding object.  Note each missile counts
         as a seperate ship.  

EXplr: the explosion ratio of a self destructing object.  Related also to
       the density of the object.

EXplr = ln(TL-6) * Eunits * TSM * DENS

       for missiles this is typically 100%, for a "nonrigged" starcruiser
       about 25%.  In this case Eunits are energy units dedicated to the
       explosion.  It is considered a static amount.

ODVen: damage delivered by energy weapons

NOW: number of energy weapon systems

     ODVenbase = ln(TL-8) * NOW
     ODVen = ln(TL-8) + Ecur-units * NOW

ODVenmass: mass of energy weapons.

	   ODVenmass = NOW / ln(TL)

DCV: is the ability of an object to avoid damage via an energy/mass field.

      INTcomp can be derived from a dedicated computer system (for defensive
      systems) or have shared intelligence with a multi-purpose system (see
      discussion on computers).

     DCVbase = INTcomp * ln(TL-7)
     DCV = INTcomp * ln(TL-7) +Ecur-units + Tactics-skill

DCVmass: mass of defensive energy systems

         DCVmass = ln(TL-7)

DSC: is the ships hard defensive screens
     
     DSCbase = ln(TL-10) * ln(TL)
     DSC = ln(TL-10) * Ecur-units * ln(TL)

DSCmass: mass of hard defensive screens

     DSCmass = ln(TL-10) * 10 / TL
- ----
Ship movement and gravatics

MADGcurr: is an energy based, non-gravatic maneuver drive based in Gs.

MADmass: the maneuver drive mass (assigned during ship construction).
     
     MADGbase = ln(TL-8) * MADmass * 5 / TSM
     MADGcurr = ln(TL-8) * MADmass * 5 * Ecur-units / TSM

CGunits: the exchangeable units of produced by a contragravity unit.  A unit
         that produces 100 units could move 100 tons at 1G, 200 tons at .5G
 	 etc.

CGmass: the contra gravity units mass.

CGrange: the range of the contra gravity device in kilometers.
	 
	 there are 3 (known) contra gravity technologies available:

Fuss:
	 CGunits = CGmass * (TL-9) * ln(TL)
	 CGrange = CGmass

Fuss/partial M-to-E:	 
	 CGunits = CGmass * (TL-14) * (TL-14) * ln(TL) * Ecur-units
	 CGrange = CGmass * (Ecur-units)**2

M-to-E:n
	 CGunits = CGmass * (TL-18) * (TL-18) * ln(TL) * ln(TL) * Ecur-units
	 CGrange = CGmass * (ln(TL))**2 * Ecur-units

JU: the hyperspace jump capabilities of the ship.  There are three 
    (known) hyperspace jump technologies.  JU1 is a point-to-point 
    hyperspace jump with fixed time.  JU2 is a point-to-point hyperspace
    jump with variable time.  JU3 is a variable hyperspace jump with
    variable time.  Normally JU is measured in parsecs.  Actually JU3 is
    the same as JUpar.  

INTcompJU: the minimum intelligence of the computer required for each 
           parsec travelled for JU1 and JU2.  For JUpar it defines the
           minimum computer intelligence required for the number of 
	   parsecs per hour.

	   INTcompJU = 1/ln(TL)

JUtime: timing interval of the hyperspace jump in 20 hour days.

JUmass: mass of the jump drive.

JUbase: constant part of JU calculation

JUpar: jump in parsecs per hour

Fuss:
    JUbase1 = ln(TL) * (TL-9) / TSM (or BSM)

    JU1 = Ecur-units * JUbase1

    JUtime1 = 7 days
    
    JUmass1 = JUbase1 * 100 / ln(TL)

Fuss/partial M-to-E:
    JUbase2 - ln(TL) * (TL-14) / TSM (or BSM)

    JU2 = Ecur-units * JUbase2 * JUtime2

    JUtime2 = time in "local" days in hyperspace

    JUmass2 = JUbase2 * 100 / ln(TL)

M-to-E:
    JUbase3 = ln(TL) * (TL-18) / TSM (or BSM)

    JUpar = Ecur-units * JUbase3

    JUmass3 = JUbase3 * 10 / ln(TL)

- ----
Life support, internal energy systems and floor space

SCsum: The total size of creatures in equation.  Take 6.41 as the average
	human large sized person. (see size ratios)

ISYSeunits: energy used by internal energy systems (life support, 
	    communications, low and high resolution scanners).

ISYSmass: mass of internal energy systems.

	    ISYSeunits = SCsum / ln(TL)

	    ISYSmass = ISYSeunits

CRYeunits: energy units used by cryogenic systems.

CRYmass: mass of cryogenic system.

	    CRYeunits = SCsum / (ln(TL)**2)

	    CRYmass = CRYeunits

FLmass: mass of all cabins, bridges, floorspace, equipment, cargo bays and
	the like.

FLsq3: all floor space in cubic meters for the ship.

       FLmass = FLsq3 / (27 * ln(TL))
- ----    
Scanning, communications and observing

SClong: long range scanning and communications.

SCldist: distance of long range scanning and communications.

SCshort: short range (detailed) scanning and communications.
	 
	 SCsbase = INTcomp * ln(TL-7)
	 SCshort = INTcomp * ln(TL-7) + Ecur-units + FWD-Observer-skill
- ----

HUmass: Ship hall mass

HUDV: Ship hull defensive value.

Hpips: HUDV in hit points.

	HUDV = ln(TL-7) * HUmass / 100

The list has been ominously quiet lately.  Everyone must be out doing
their holiday shopping.  I suspect it may be pretty slow this month.  Oh
well, over the last 9 months we\'ve averaged around 50 messages/month!

PART 2

Deep space, between Suleiman and Easter in the Solomani Rim 

	O\'Connor drifted gently down the black corridor, controlling his 
motion with an occasional gentle touch of a nearby wall. His suit light 
splashed emptily on the walls and vanished into the darkness up ahead. His 
breath, loud in his ears, was deep and measured, utterly calm. The few lonely 
wads of human tissue remaining in his brain idly interacted with the
efficient, smoothly functioning machines as he simultaneously scanned the 
corridor ahead, kept up a running dialogue with Hector, and listened to the 
voices and data inputs from his friends, elsewhere in the huge, dead ship.

	*No kidding.* O\'Connor sighed. It was the first sound he\'d made in 
over three hours.
	"Daryavayush? That you?"
	O\'Connor noted the tone of concern in Grant\'s voice. "Yes, sir," he 
replied easily, reaching out to grasp the edge of the portal leading into the 
forward section of the ship. "I\'m entering the forward section."
	"Keep in touch. I\'d hate to be the threat that ran into you, but 
regular voice contact will keep me from getting old before my time."
	O\'Connor smiled mirthlessly. "As you wish, sir. Should I set my 
internal time system to prod me once per hour?"
	Now it was Grant\'s turn to sigh. "Why couldn\'t that shell have taken 
out the part of your brain that controls sarcasm?"
	O\'Connor\'s grin widened a tiny bit. "It did, sir," he said pleasantly. 
"I am always literal and serious. You must have realized that by now."
	"Yeah, right. Stay on the line. Sanchez?"
	No answer.
	"SANCHEZ!"
	"YO! Uh, I mean, yessir?"
	"Wake up, dammit! I\'m putting together a net line. Jaeger?"
	"Right here."
	"How\'s your masterpiece coming along?"
	"Impressively. The Hivers built well. I wonder what happened here?"
	"I may have figured it out. Kherk?"
	"Yeah, Captain, I\'m here. Boosting my gain."
	"Good. Listen up, people. Hector\'s come up with a possible correlation 
between known traffic and lost ships in the area and this hulk."
	*Why didn\'t you tell ME that?*
	|you did not ask|
	"Thirteen Imperial years ago, a Hiver research vessel vanished in this 
section of space. It had a crew of over four hundred Hivers, and get this: It 
was doing research on the Jump-6 barrier!"
	"Hmm. That\'d explain a lot. I\'ve heard of Jump drives tearing through 
the hull, but never just vanishing off their mounts!"
	"But what happened to the crew?"
	"No Hivers, living or dead. No equipment at all. Everything stripped 
to the bare walls. My guess is that they cannibalized the entire ship to turn 
their subsidiary craft into lifeboats. I wonder if...hey, Kherk, I\'m losing 
your signal!"
	"Oh, don\'t worry, Captain! I jsssk wanted to finish chhshhh these 
stupid whhhhhkkkkkkks before heading back to th--"
	His voice ended abruptly.
	O\'Connor waited for the return of his signal. It didn\'t come.
	|medical alert team leader kherkhoulloth\'s vital signs are increasing 
on an exponential curve indicative of severe stress and fear i cannot maintain 
his signal|
	"KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIII!"
	*Where is he?*
	"Kherk! We heard a scream, what\'s wrong?"
	|forward section extreme starboard water tank direction map follows|
	"Ca, Ca, C-C-CAP, CAPTAIN! SANCHEZ, O\'CONNOR, EVERYBODY!"
	*Received. On my way.*
	O\'Connor shut his cybernetic eye, allowing the mapped route through 
the twisting corridors to play out inside his skull. He kicked in the 
thrusters on his suit, and rocketed across the open expanse of the forward 
section at a dangerously high speed for such an enclosed space.
	"HELP! FIRE! MURDER!"
	"O\'CONNOR! Kherk\'s in trouble!"
	"On my way, sir." O\'Connor executed a neat turn and braked to a halt 
by the corridor leading to the water tanks, in what once had been the belly of 
the ship. He saw a frantically weaving headlamp rushing toward him at 
breakneck speed, and quickly reached out a restraining arm, grabbing hold of 
the edge of the portal with the other.
	"HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA--OOF!" The metal arm caught Kherkhoulloth hard in 
the chest, dragging him roughly to a halt. Through the silvered glass of his 
helmet O\'Connor could see the frantic stare of the screeching Vargr, the foam 
on his chops. He took a half second to review what little he knew about battle
hysteria in Vargr, decided he had insufficient data for a suitable response, 
and shrugged. With a mighty heave, he slammed Kherkhoulloth hard against the 
nearest wall.
	The clang reverberated through the walls of the ship and could be 
heard through the micorphone in Kherkhoulloth\'s helmet. After a moment, his 
struggles ceased, and he drew a long, shuddering breath.
	"Thanks. I\'m okay now," he managed shakily. "Let go of me!"
	*Hector?*
	|vital signs returning to normal limits albeit slowly|
	"What\'s going on over there, dammit! O\'Connor?"
	"I have Kherk, sir. He\'s badly frightened but not hurt."
	"Tell that to my ribs, you walking rust heap!"
	"What the hell made him scream like that?"
	"Unknown. No immediate threat in evidence."
	"No, no! It\'s okay, I\'m sorry I scared everyone, I was just really 
startled out of my wits. You\'d better come and see this, Daryavayush...."
He led the way back to an open, black hole in the deck, O\'Connor following 
with gun drawn. Kherkhoulloth pointed down into the hole.
	"Down there. It\'s horrible!"
	*Patch my eye to Jaeger\'s camera. I want this recorded.*
	|executing|
	"O\'Connor, this is Jaeger. Is that your view I\'m seeing now?"
	"Yes. Keep it recording, Iscin." O\'Connor knelt by the hole, reached
down, and gently propelled himself down into the opening. Every member of the
crew heard his sudden intake of breath. 
	"What the hell can scare O\'Connor?"
	"I don\'t want to know."
	"No, you don\'t." Kherkhoulloth shivered. "You really don\'t."
	O\'Connor stepped forward, regarding the corpse carefully. It was a 
human, adult, probably female, and any information beyond that wouldn\'t be 
easy to ascertain. The body had been nailed spreadeagled to the inside of the 
tank wall, upside down, and had been systematically flayed apart inch by inch. 
It must have taken her days to die, he thought grimly. And as to how it had 
felt... he gently touched the jaw, felt it move slackly even in rigor mortis. 
She had screamed so loudly she\'d dislocated her jaw right out of its socket.
The dead eyes hung from their sockets, exploded in the vacuum. The flesh was 
utterly frozen, but before it had chilled her lifeblood had flowed over the 
deck and dried in a sickening brown pool.
	It was then that O\'Connor saw the next corpse. It was an Aslan male, 
his fur torn out in fistfuls, tail half sawn away, bowels raked out. The man\'s 
eyes were shut tight, his jaw frozen shut: even in his agony he wouldn\'t cry 
out. Beside him there was another human. And another. And another....
	His eyes flicked around the inside of the tank, counting. Ten, eleven, 
twelve, thirteen-- wait a minute! The last corpse was that of a Droyne, its 
wings carefully shredded into bloody ribbons and tied into knots, its scales 
pulled out one by one, every joint bent backward and broken. A single spar of 
metal was driven through its skull, and its mouth was bound bulgingly shut 
with a tangle of computer cable. O\'Connor gently undid the cable and pried the 
mouth open, suddenly curious. The others were allowed to scream; this one...?
	Slowly, floating eerily in the zero gravity, a stream of gold disks 
floated out of the stretched, bloody mouth, one, two, three dozen of them. 
	O\'Connor gently gathered them out of the air and put them away in a 
pocket. The one blank spot on the wall, right behind the ladder, came aglow 
under the light of his headlamp: a series of lines of text, scrawled crudely 
in blood.
	"O\'Connor? Are you all right?"
	He didn\'t answer. Instead, he looked closer, trying to make out the 
words. As his eyes followed the text, he heard Jaeger reading aloud....
	
	"Here they lie, victims of his sense of humor
	 They thought they had all the answers
	 What they got wasn\'t what they expected
	 He is alone and yet with each and all of us
	 He is strong, angry, mighty in triumph
	 He was human once, and still is, mostly--
	 What\'s left, we\'re working on.

	 Hi ho."

	O\'Connor straightened up. "We\'re going to need coldsleep capsules to
preserve the bodies," he said coolly. "Back away from the opening, Kherk, I\'m 
coming out."
	"Bodies? WHAT bodies?"
	"Uh, \'Hi ho\'?"
	"Would somebody please tell me WHAT\'S GOING ON?"
	O\'Connor drifted up into the hallway, and met Kherkhoulloth\'s troubled 
eyes. "We\'re coming back, sir," he said softly. "We\'ll have visuals to show 
you, and a full report. But you aren\'t going to like it."
	And as he turned to seek the way out, Kherkhoulloth leading the way, 
O\'Connor wondered idly if he still had the part of his brain that could have
nightmares.
	*And if I do,* he added, *Could I shut it off?*

  Hello all.

  Has anyone looked at Gurps Space?  I like the traveller universe and the
"feel" of it, but I dislike the ways skills are handled, as well as the
horrendously inefficient fusion/AM plants.  (for example: an atomic missle is
going to do much, much more damage than a conventional one.  Likewise, an
antimatter missle could easily build up stellar catastrophe size in a
relatively small space.)

  I was thinking of adapting the standard task system to the Gurps style rules,
then implementing most of the features of the travelller starships in gurps
terms and playing in the standard imperium.  It could be very interesting.

  Anyhow, if anyone has any ideas, let me know.  (Note to the star system
generation folks: the machine that I can usually talk to you from is not
letting me at the moment.  This will be fixed by the time I get back in Jan.)

  (James:Congrats on the success of the TML.  Impressive.)

  See you all.

Second in a series of alternate rules on starhips.  Inspired by 
progammability in original travller rules.

___________________________________________________________________________


Basic starship operation

The operational parameters for different tech level star ships are
different.  Some may be present in one technology and not present in
another.  Common to tech level 8 to tech level 30 ships are the number
of Eunits that the chip can generate.  Thus each ship has a number of
Eunits that are available for *variable* functions of the ship.  The
distribution of Eunits to various ship functions should conform to a
number of predefined configurations or programs.  Starships may be
reconfigured during the movement phase of the round.

There are number of Variables that are programmed for a configuration:

OCV ODVen EXPL DCV  DSC MADG CGunits CGrange JU SCshort

When the starship is constructed there are a number of total Eunits
for ship consumption from one or more Energy generators.  Some Eunits
must be dedicated to internal systems (ISYSeunits) others go into
these programmable variables.  These Eunits are assigned to the
variables so one or more actions are optimized.

Typical configurations might be:

Green One subspace: 5% OCV 5% ODVen 5% DCV 15% DSC 25% MADG
                10% CGunits 0% JU 10% SCshort 25% reserve.
Normal subspace programming with energy reserve.

Green Two subspace: 5% OCV 5% ODVen 5% DCV 5% DSC 50% MADG
          25% CGunits 0% JU 5% SCshort 0% reserve.
Fast movement subspace programming.

Green One hyperspace: 5% OCV 5% ODVen 5% DCV 5% DSC 5% MADG
		  5% CGunits 30% JU 5% SCshort 35% reserve.
Normal hyperspace programming with energy reserve.

Green Two hyperspace: 0% OCV 0% ODVen 0% DCV 0% DSC 0% MADG
		  5% CGunits 90% JU 5% SCshort 0% reserve.
Fast hyperspace programming.

Yellow one: 12% OCV 12% ODVen 12% DCV 12% DSC 12% MADG
	    12% CGunits 0% JU 5% SCshort 23% reserve.
Balanced defense and offense with reserve.

Yellow two: 25% OCV 12% ODVen 12% DCV 25% DSC 5% MADG
	    5% CGunits 0% JU 5% SCshort 12% reserve.
Defense with greater offense.

Yellow three: 25% OCV 12% ODVen 23% DCV 25% DSC 5% MADG
	      5% CGunits 0% JU 5% SCshort 0% reserve.
Defense with high level of offense.

Red one: 10% OCV 5% ODVen 30% DCV 30% DSC 10% MADG
	 0% CGunits 0% JU 0% SCshort 15% Reserve.
Offense with greater defense.

Red two: 15% OCV 5% ODVen 35% DCV 35% DSC 10% MADG
	 0% CGunits 0% JU 0% SCshort 0% reserve.
Offense with high level of defense.

Red three: 0% OCV 0% ODVen 50% DCV 45% DSC 5% MADG
	   0% CGunits 0% JU 0% SCshort 0% reserve.
Maximal defense.

Black one:  35% OCV 40% ODVen 5% DCV 5% DSC 5% MADG
	      5% CGunits 0% JU 5% SCshort 0% reserve.
Maximal offense.

Grey one: 10% OCV 10% ODVen 10% DCV 10% DSC 10% MADG
	  10% CGunits 10% JU 10% SCshort 20% reserve.
Equal spread of energy.

White one: 90% EXPL 10% MADG
Missile or self destruct with maximum explosion damage.

Blue one: low OCV low ODVen low ODVprox low DCV mid DSC low MADG
          high CGunits nil JU high SCshort (and a reserve of Eunits)
Maximize probing and sensors.

	Oh yea, before I forget. There is a computer Role playing game under
development at this point. It\'s due out in the first quarter of 1990. It\'s
a IBM PC game. I will be based on MegaTraveller, more on this later.

Have you ever seen "Elite"?  Originally written for the British BBC Micro, this
game has been converted for a range of machines, including IBM PC, C-64 and
Atari ST.  You are the pilot of a small starship; your objective is to go
around trading in various commodities (some illegal), make money, and upgrade
your ship.  You also get attacked by various bad guys, namely pirates and the
alien Thargoids.  There are missions to accomplish, which you are given as the
game progresses.  The trading, and some of the planetary data, bears some
resemblance to Traveller.

Another such game is "Federation Of Free Traders", written for the Atari ST and
Amiga.  I don\'t know if it\'s available in the U.S.A.  Like "Elite", you are a
space trader out to make money and kill things.  The planetary data is pure
Traveller format, though the galaxies supplied bear no resemblance to any
published Traveller sectors.  This game isn\'t as good as "Elite", as the prices
of goods don\'t change much between planets, even very different planets; and
the opposition doesn\'t act as intelligently.

Both these games are more "arcadish" than the ones Richard mentioned, in that
they involve more shooting and less strategy.  But they feature some nice solid
3-D graphics, and involve a lot more than just going around shooting things.

It is also now out for the Amiga, although I have not seen it.

I have the 64 version, and it is what I consider a "shoot \'em up" Arcade game.
It is tough, in that you start with no money and are a real easy target.

I do like how the ship handles it is like a real space ship. You have yaw and 
pitch. So it takes some getting used to. The thing I hate the most is the
docking. You have this space station that spins on you have to match its 
rotation and then get in the damn bay entrance cleanly or you die. Nothing 
worse than fighting of all these pirates just to blow up trying to dock.

Alas alackaday!

Hey, gang, my thesis advisor has just informed me that I\'m being shipped
off to Oak Ridge for about a month, starting on the day after New Years\'.
I\'ll be back sometime in early February, with luck, and I will of course
immediately reattach myself to the List. But I\'m hereby asking James to 
remove me as of the end of the workday Friday, to give me time to clean
up my disks and so forth before I leave. (I have a feeling that just with
my regular mail I\'m going to go over quota while I\'m gone, and the Oak
Ridge system is restricted, so I can\'t forward things). I\'ll be out of here
for vacation on the 20th; if you have anything to ask or say that won\'t
wait until Groundhog Day or so, catch me now or forever hold your peace.

I wish each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday season.

	I was in a fighter squadron (VF-114) on the Kitty Hawk from
	1970 to 1973. This included two combat cruises to Vietnam.
	On later crusises (72), the AOE class supply ships (I think
	AOE is the correct ship type) like the Kansas City and
	Sacramento were available for unrep (underway replenishment).
	The AOE carries everything; food, JP-5, avgas, ordinance, spare
	parts, and ship fuel (NSFO & ND):one stop shopping.

	With the AOE the the rate of replenishment was mostly determined
	by ordinance. in 72 we were using a lot of bombs ( > 200 tons/day ).
	We would fly for 12 hours and break for 12 hours. we would
	resupply every three to five days during the non-flying time.
	About every 14 days we would have a stand-down day where we were
	supposed to take it easy but the aircraft maintanence people
	(me) worked even harder because all of the planes were available.
	This would go on for 30 to 60 days ( a line period ) after which
	we would go to SUBIC BAY for 4-5 days of liberty and then go back
	to the line. A cruise lasted 9-12 months.

	The AOEs were huge. THe main deck was at about the same level
	as the hanger deck, which made unrep a little easier. They were
	almost as long as the carrier. There were at least two fuel lines
	and four cargo lines between ships.  The AOE also had a helicopter
	pad aft and a hanger for two CH-46s (I\'m not sure about the type,
	it had two rotors fore & aft). The helicopters would take the light
	stuff to the flight deck.

	Mostly we took on bombs. After 2+ hours there would be bombs and
	bomb finn pallets everywhere; in the magazines (full), the mess decks,
	the hanger deck, and the starboard side of the island on the
	roof. After 3-5 days of flying it would be all gone & we\'d do
	it again.

Subject: Relative distances and sizes in the Universe.

        Several weeks ago I posted a request for slide sets comparing the 
    relative distances in the solar system and the other stars:  It would 
    seem that slide sets of this scale system are rather hard to come by.  
    I sent out a request to several other computer networks, along with 
    calling a number of planetariums, museum stores, and searched through 
    various scientific catalogues, all without significant result.  

        I was able to use my resources and gather some information
    from several friends on various types of relative celestial scales, 
    and have come up with some relevant information.

        The first selection depicts the solar system on a major league
    baseball field from E. C. Slipher\'s "Planet" section of THE WORLD BOOK
    ENCYCLOPEDIA P, VOLUME 15, Field Enterprises Educational Corporation,
    Chicago, Illinois, 1964.  If the Sun were the size of a United States 
    half-dollar (fifty cents) on home plate, the planet Mercury would be 
    120 centimeters (four feet) away, Venus would be 225 centimeters
    (7.5 feet) away, Earth would be 315 centimeters (10.5 feet) distant,
    Mars would be 480 centimeters (sixteen feet) away, Jupiter would be
    1,650 centimeters (55 feet) from the Sun (at the pitcher\'s mound),
    Saturn would be 3,030 centimeters (101 feet) away (near second base, 
    and the last planet in the infield), Uranus would be 6,075 centimeters
    (202.5 feet) away, Neptune would be 9,540 centimeters (318 feet) away,  
    and Pluto would be 12,615 centimeters (420.5 feet) distant from the 
    Sun, deep in the outfield.

        To compare planetary diameters, if the Sun were the size of an 
    average beachball, then Jupiter would be a golf ball, Saturn a Ping-
    Pong ball, Uranus and Neptune marbles, Mercury and Pluto pinheads, 
    and Venus, Earth, and Mars would be about half the size of tackheads.

        The next comparison scale comes from the "Life on Other Worlds" 
    section of Carl Sagan\'s PLANETS, LIFE Science Library, 1966.  This
    one depicts the solar system on a map of Europe and Africa, with the 
    average distance between the Sun and Earth, 150 million kilometers 
    (93 million miles) - also known as one Astronomical Unit (A.U.) -
    now equaling 240 kilometers (150 miles).  If the Sun were situated 
    in Norway, Saturn would orbit just south of Italy, and Pluto would 
    be 10,400 kilometers (6,500 miles) away along the Cape of Good Hope 
    in South Africa.

        The next source on various celestial scales comes from THE
    STARFLIGHT HANDBOOK: A PIONEER\'S GUIDE TO INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL, by
    Eugene F. Mallove and Gregory L. Matloff (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New
    York, 1989, ISBN 0-471-61912-4, hardcover), which gives the following
    description on page 5:  If the Sun were the size of a one-centimeter
    (0.4-inch) marble, then Earth would be 0.1 millimeters (0.004 inches)
    in diameter and one meter (39.37 inches) from the Sun.  The planet
    Pluto would orbit 42 meters (139 feet) from the Sun, and Proxima
    Centauri - the Sun\'s nearest stellar neighbor - would be 292
    kilometers (175 miles) away. 

        The next two books listed are both authored by Neil McAleer.
    The first is THE COSMIC MIND-BOGGLING BOOK (Warner Books, Inc.,
    New York, 1982, ISBN 0-446-37932-8, paperback).  On the front cover 
    of the book, the following comparison is made (one of my favorites,
    from an aesthetic point of view):  If the solar system out to the
    orbit of Pluto could fit in a coffee cup, the Milky Way Galaxy
    would be the size of the North American continent.

        On page xiii - If you had a specially-designed automobile
    which could handle the rigors of spaceflight, it would take you
    201 billion years to "drive" from the Sun to the center of the
    Milky Way Galaxy at 161 kilometers per hour (100 miles per hour).
    Also, if the solar system were 2.54 centimeters (one inch) across, 
    the Milky Way Galaxy would be 161,000 kilometers (100,000 miles) wide.

        On pages 3-4 - If the Sun were the size of a sixty-centimeter
    (two-foot) beachball, Earth would be the size of a pea and 6,450
    centimeters (215 feet) away.  The planet Jupiter would be a large
    orange 31,680 centimeters (1,056 feet) distant from the Sun.

        On pages 12-13 - If the Sun were a 14-centimeter (5-inch) orange, 
    Earth would be a sesame seed fifteen meters (49 feet) away.  Pluto
    would be the size of a grain of millet six hundred meters (3,400
    feet) away, and the star Alpha Centauri would be four thousand 
    kilometers (2,500 miles) from the Sun.

        On page 83 - If you could fly a specially modified Boeing 747
    jetliner through space at 965 kilometers per hour (six hundred miles
    per hour), it would take you 1,903 years to fly from the orbit of
    the planet Uranus out to the orbit of Neptune.    

        On page 128 - If the Sun were a basketball in New York City, 
    then Alpha Centauri would be another basketball eight thousand
    kilometers (five thousand miles) away in Honolulu, Hawaii.

        On page 129 - If you traveled at the speed which the APOLLO
    spacecraft used in an average six-day round-trip journey to Earth\'s 
    Moon (approximately 40,000 kilometers per hour/25,000 miles per hour), 
    it would take you 850,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri.  By contrast, 
    the faster PIONEER 10 and 11 and VOYAGER 1 and 2 Jovian probes will 
    reach that distance (4.3 light years) in only eighty thousand years.

        On page 161 - If you used a starship traveling at one-tenth the 
    speed of light (300,000 kilometers per second/186,000 miles per second)
    to reach the farthest star in the Milky Way Galaxy, the ship would
    take 800,000 years to reach it from the Sun.  If one Astronomical 
    Unit (A.U.) - the distance between the Sun and Earth, which is 
    roughly 150 million kilometers/93 million miles - were reduced to 
    2.54 centimeters (one inch), then that farthest star would be
    127,000 kilometers (79,000 miles) away.

        The next selection is from the other Neil McAleer book, THE 
    MIND-BOGGLING UNIVERSE (Doubleday & Co. Inc., Garden City, New 
    York, 1987, ISBN 0-385-23039-7, paperback):

        On pages 10-11 - If the solar system out to Pluto were 2.54 
    centimeters (one inch) in diameter, then the center of the Milky
    Way Galaxy would be 609 kilometers (379 miles) away.  Also, to
    walk one A.U. at five kilometers per hour (three miles per hour)
    would take 3,500 years.  To drive one light year at 88 kilometers
    per hour (55 miles per hour) would take 12.2 million years.

        On page 15 - The Milky Way Galaxy\'s longest spiral arm of gas, 
    dust, and stars is 125,000 light years long.  It would take an
    automobile driving at 88 kilometers per hour (55 miles per hour)
    1.5 trillion years to cover that distance. 

        On page 35 - An automobile driving at 88 kph (55 mph) would
    take 52 million years to reach Proxima Centauri from the Sun.

        The next selection comes from THE UNIVERSE...AND BEYOND by 
    Terence Dickinson (Camden House Publishing, Ltd., Camden East,
    Ontario, Canada, 1986, ISBN 0-920656-48-X, paperback):

        On pages 16-19 - If the actual distance between the Milky Way 
    Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy (two million light years) were shrunk 
    to a typical book-reading distance, then the most remote galaxies
    known would be 1.6 kilometers (one mile) away.

        If the Sun were shrunk to the size of a 2.54-centimeter (one 
    inch) Ping-Pong ball, Earth would become a dust speck 240 centimeters 
    (eight feet) away, with the Moon being an even smaller speck just
    6.25 millimeters (0.25-inch) from Earth.  Jupiter would be a pea 
    1,200 centimeters (forty feet) from the Sun, and Pluto is a dust
    speck nine thousand centimeters (three hundred feet) away.  The
    Oort Cloud of comets surrounding our solar system would be the 
    size of atomic particles and reside several kilometers distant,
    with the comets themselves averaging several meters apart from
    each other.  The Alpha Centauri trinary star system would consist
    of two walnuts (Alpha and Beta) and a pea (Proxima) 640 kilometers
    (four hundred miles) from our solar system.

        If Earth\'s solar orbit were reduced to the size of a United
    States dime, the average distance between stars is now a little 
    over one kilometer (1.6 miles).  The Milky Way Galaxy would be
    the actual size of Earth.  The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy 
    would be over half the actual distance between Earth and the Moon.

        If you could hold the Milky Way Galaxy in your hand, the stars
    in it would be sub-atomic in size, and the Andromeda Galaxy would
    be 210 centimeters (seven feet) away.

        My final textbook selection comes from CYCLES OF FIRE, by 
    William K. Hartmann and Ron Miller (Workman Publishing, New York,
    1987, ISBN 0-89480-502-9, paperback):

        On pages 14-15 - If Earth were the diameter of a microparticle
    of soot, then the Sun would be one hundred times larger, the size
    of a mote of dust, or one hundredth of a millimeter across.  The
    solar system would be the size of a saucer, and the Oort Cloud of
    comets would exist several house lots away.  Alpha Centauri would
    be another dust mote one to two city blocks from the Sun, and the
    Milky Way Galaxy would be the size of North America.  Some of the
    other nearby galaxies would be the varying sizes and distances of
    Earth\'s continents.  The known limits of the Universe would stretch
    halfway across the solar system.

        My friend and co-worker Drew LePage came up with some various
    calculations on the celestial distance scale:

        If the orbit of Pluto were the size of a U.S. dime, this would be
    the size of various distances in the Universe: 
    
    	Earth\'s orbit would have a diameter of about 0.5 millimeter (about 
    half the thickness of a dime).
    
    	One light year would be about 15.2 meters (49.9 feet).
    
    	One parsec (3.26 light years) would be about 49.7 meters (163 feet).
    
    	The closest star would be 65.4 meters (214 feet) away.
    
    	The closest one hundred known stars would be inside a sphere about 
    640 meters (2,100 feet) across.
    
    	The Sun would be 456 kilometers (283 miles) from the center of the 
    Milky Way Galaxy.
    
    	The Milky Way Galaxy would be 1,520 kilometers (945 miles) across.
    
        To put intergalatic distances into perspective, if the Milky Way
    Galaxy were the size of a dime:
    
    	The orbit of Pluto would be about the size of a hydrogen atom.

    	The Andromeda Galaxy would be 41.8 centimeters (16.5 inches) away.

    	One megaparsec would equal 61.9 centimeters (2.03 feet).
            
        The recently discovered "Wall" of Galaxies would be about 40 meters 
    (125 feet) to 60 meters (190 feet) away, about 3 meters (10 feet) thick, 
    and extend for at least 100 meters (300 feet). 
    
    	The most distant quasar known would be about 2.6 kilometers 
    (1.7 miles) away.
    
        The size of the observable Universe would be about 5.7 kilometers
    (3.5 miles) across. 

        If nothing else, these figures should give some idea as to just
     how incredibly vast the known Universe is.

These two don\'t jibe.  One inch is smaller than a coffee cup, but 161,000
km is definitely larger than North America.  The proper ratios (using 4.2
light hours and 100,000 light years) is one to about 200 million, and 208
million inches is 3156 miles, so the coffe cup vs North America analogy is
the "correct" one.  The ratio of 1 inch to 100,000 miles is about the ratio
of the *Earth\'s* orbit to the Galaxy.

	Other than that, the article was fascinating.  I\'ve often tried
to convey to friends the vastness of the solar system alone, and then
the galaxy... and the Universe... Some of the analogies wowed me yet again.
Gosh, this is a BIG place.

> 	[About resupply during Carrier operations]

About resupply in Traveller Naval Operations:

This would be a major problem in extended naval operations ranging over
a Sector or more. It is alleviated somewhat by the use of pure-energy
weapons whose only reqirements are power from the powerplant (and in some
cases: hydrogen from the tanks). Hydrogen is free for taking at your
friendly neighbourhood gasgiant (in most cases). 
The trouble is the material munitions (missiles, sandcannisters etc). 
Those weapons is popular because they give more "Bang for the MegaWatts"
Their disadvantage is their limited ammo and the need to bring extra ammo
along. Supposedly on large, armored cargoships.
Other material things a fleet will need is spareparts, spare crew and
recharges for the life-support systems. Some of this can be carried on
the warships but the main part of the supplys will be stored on supplyships.
The supplyships will either follow the fleet or travel between it and a source
of supply (Naval Depot or Industrial world with TL 14+ can supply everything
a fleet need (except perhaps life-support recharges) but these can be found
on any Agricultural world regardless of TL).
If the supplyships are to follow the fleet there have to be a large number
of them to guarantee that the supplys will last until the next supplyrun
to a planet. This large number of ships is a tempting target and must be
protected.
If the method of continous supplys are adopted the major problem involves
finding the fleet. Information flows with the same speed as the fleet moves
(1 jump per week) so when the supplyships arrive they might find that the
fleet has been chased away and that the enemy now holds that system.
One approach to this problem is using predesignated meetingpoints that the
fleet will jump to to be supplyed. These points might not even be in systems,
they might just be coordinates in deep space. 

These problems with supply will lead to a preferrence for pure energy weapons
(Lasers, PA\'s, Fusionguns, Plasmaguns, Mesonguns, Disintegrators, Repulsors
and all kinds of screens) in forces that are not geared towards pure defence-
missions. Likewise a planetary invasion force will equipp themselves with 
as big proportion of laser and enery weapons and possible. The troops will
have lasers, FGMPs and PGMPs, and the vehicles will only use munitionusing
weapons in specific circumstances. (VRF GaussGuns).
The planetary defenders, on the other hand, may defend with every kind of
weapon imaginable: missiles, artillery, massdrivers, rocketlaunchers etc
*in addition* to the normal spectrum of weapons.

Planetary invasions are even more supplyconsuming than "pure" space battles.
There is a need for troops, landingcrafts, combat vehicles, recon drones,
decoys, weapons for the troops, ammo for all kinds of weapons, bombs for
defence supression, food for the troops, etc etc.
All this will require continous supplymission out of the system. Harrased
by hiding SDB\'s and Commerse Raiders and disturbed by the largescale fighting
that might still go on in the subsector.

All this condenses to: It\'s easier to defend than to attack.
The defender might have large stashes of supplys hidden beforehand in systems
and deep space while the attacker must bring everything with him. In any case
the defender will have shorter supplyruns than the attacker.
In the case of planetary sieges and invasions this advantage for the defender
is even more pronounced and will in some cases outweigh the tactical advantage
of "holding the high ground" that the attacker has.

Supplyships will probably be very large. 50 000 tons and larger. If the fleet 
is forced to bring it\'s own fuel it would also contain several 1 000 000 tons
fleet tankers. Other supplyships that can be found in a fleet are big refinerys
that produces pure fuel for those ships that lack their own plants, And also
a mobile repaircenter of 500 000 tons that provides extra repair facilies.

I would imagine that a IMC Landingship or a IN Destroyer also would
look something like that at the start of a long mission. All available
space occupied by supplys. Ammo, spareparts and Liquid Oxygen bottles stacked
in all passageways, recreation rooms, and even in the cabins.

I seem to remember that in Fifth Frontier War, although I haven\'t played it in 
years, that there was a provision for tankers. This was a necessity if you jump
into a system that does not have a Gas Giant to refuel at. Otherwise you were 
stuck in system until you conquered it, then you could refuel from the planet.

If you have to bounce into a system to wage a planetary (or multi-planetary)
attack, then after you have a supplyship come in (possibly even of a size
small enought to service one ship, like a cruiser), then how about
DISMANTLING the supplyship and using it for spare parts, like the armor, the
electronics, etc.  The suppplyship would be built kind of modularly.

Other larger supply ships can warp in, then warp out when they are empty.

I dunno, I kinda of got the idea from reading "Common Denominator" by
David Lewis, in the October 1972 Analog.  I\'ve read more sci-fi
in these mag/books than I ever read in paperback/hardcover/anthology form.
The amount of science facts (in the science columns) exceeds the amount of
knowledge I learned sitting through my physics and mechanics classes too!
Only problem is I guess I should be studying right now instead of reading
the fun stuff!

One solution to the problem of re-supplying warships is the use of supply
ships which hide at some secret location.  In WW2, the German commerce
raiders did this.  Their supply ships were fast, armed tankers.  They
would be at a pre-arranged point, at a pre-arranged time.  One such point,
code-named "Andalusia", was used regularly.  The supply ships brought
ammo, foodstuffs and spare parts, and sometimes took away prisoners of war.

In a Traveller campaign, suitable places could include systems whose main
world is too low tech to be able to scan the whole system for intruders;
systems with no population; or empty hexes.  The last of these would, of
course, require two additional jumps to use, and would only really be of
use for transferring large quantities of ammo or spare parts.  Refuelling
really is only practical with tankers which accompany the fleet (as in the
board game "Fifth Frontier War"), from captured territory, or from gas
giants.  The boardgame says the system must contain no hostile, active
ships if you are to use the gas giant.  High Guard says that refuelling
while enemy ships are around is risky, which is why some ships stay outside
the gas giant to cover those ships refuelling - they are the High Guard.

Another source is raided enemy shipping.  One German warship, the "pocket
battleship" Admiral Scheer, captured a British refridgerator ship named
Duquesa.  The Scheer never went short of fresh food, especially eggs, for
the rest of the voyage!

Has anyone else considered making an adventure campaign out of the exploits
of a commerce raider?  I did so once, using FASA\'s Chameleon class raider.
The players came unstuck - they kept using the ship\'s missiles when they
could have just used its secondary weapons, lasers and particle accelerators.
When they ran into serious trouble, they were just about out of missiles!

Merry Christmas, everyone!

Actually, as some of us pointed out during the discussion of "odball" objects
(black holes, brown dwarfs, etc) there may be a lot of stuff out in those
"empty" hexes. If a survey team can locate a comet-like object, that will
refuel a *lot* of ships. Figure the tonnage of a ball of ice (water, methane,
and ammonia) a few klicks across. 

The location of such covert refueling stations would be closely guarded as
while there are a lot of such iceballs out there, they are *not* easy to 
find. But what is it worth to you to have a refueling depot in interstellar
space? Better yet, what if it\'s a few light hours outside an enemy system?

In peacetime only covert operations would use these resources. In wartime
a skipper might open his sealed orders to find that he is to jump to some
location in empty space. After arriving, he\'d be met by a pilot who\'d take
the ship in. (If the crew is kept away from the nav readouts, only the pilot
knows how they got from the jump point to the fuel depot... paranoia pays!)

ENDURANCE

     Mission endurance obviously depends on opperational level.
There are three levels of opperational activity; these levels
are common to ALL GAMES, not merely the Eight Worlds.  These
levels are as follows:

     1) Tactical.  The ship is engaged in actual combat; it is
under acceleration, weapons are being fired, shields (if any) are
up, sensors are active, crew is running from place to place in
an excited and agitated fashion as the ship crumbles to bits.
     2) Strategic.  The ship is not engaged in actual combat; it 
either on station or it is in transit in a fashion calulated to
maximize endurance, weapons are secured, shields (if any) are down, 
sensors are running in a passive mode, and the crew is cruising 
around looking for dates.
     3) Derelict.  The ships drifts, lifeless and inert, utterly
empty except for the evil power that destroyed it, which power
STILL WAITS to... but I digress.

     Intermediate opperational levels are certainly possible.  A 
vessel on blockade duty (or a carrier performing flight ops in
Southeast Asia) might occupy a level intermediate between Tactical
and Strategic.  My old MGB frequently occupied a level intermediate 
between Strategic and Derelict, which is three successive car thieves
were unable to make off with it.  Why, they wondered, didn\'t it start?
The fools, the cylinder head assembly on the passenger seat should 
have been a clue.  But again I digress... where was I... oh yes:

     All three of these opperational states are extremely important
in a Role Playing Game.
     Tactical endurance is a crucial aspect of combat.  PCs who do not 
know the combat endurance of their ship will routinely run out of fuel 
at inappropriate moments.  They will then die, to the dismay of their 
players, who will have to roll up new characters.  If this happens on a 
frequent basis, the players will have to roll their dice so many times
that the corners will wear off.  The dice will then tend to roll off the 
table and under the sofa, a frustrating occurance.
     Strategic endurance limits the range and duration of missions.  
PCs who exceed these limits will run out of fuel and die, to the dismay
of... but you\'ve heard this already.
     Derelict endurance determines just how long wrecks can be expected
to last.  This is important because every self-respecting RPG has a few
derelict vessels which drift, dark, cold, Empty Except For The Evil Power,
Etc.  Many non-self-respecting RPGs will also contain such items.  If
adandoned ships generally fall out of orbit after a few years (or more
likely, drift off into deep space on hyperbolic trajectories on which 
they are unlikley to be found), then a truly ancient wreck is BIG NEWS.  
It is implausible.  The PC\'s may become suspicious.  They might well 
detect the Evil Power, Etc. before it is too late.  If, on the other hand,
ancient wrecks are commonplace, no one will ever bother to explore them.
In either situation, the Evil Power, Etc. that the GM has worked so long 
and hard to create will be wasted, a sorry fate.  For this reason, the
GM will wish to arrange matters so that ancient wrecks, while plausible, 
are also rare enough to be tantalizing.

     The situation in the Eight Worlds:
     The Eight Worlds, as I have suggested before, is an abysmally low
tech universe.  Even today, we can build spacecraft that in many 
respects are superior to those used in the Eight Worlds.  (They are also 
much more expensive and do not have hyperdrive.  These can only be 
considered to be flaws).
    The Tactical Endurance of Eight Worlds ships is measured in hours.
In order to economize on hours (a valuable substance), it is sometimes
even measured in fractions of an hour.  The chief reason for this 
limitation is fuel, which is consumed at a discouraging rate.  Another
reason is the crew, who tend to die, after which they can no longer
opperate the ship or repair damage.
     The Strategic Endurance of Eight Worlds ships is measured in days.
The superficial source of this limitation is the lifesystem: after a week 
or so, the air begins to smell bad, the output of the food machines is
indistinguishable from the input to the waste reprocessing facility,
and the walls become a garden to delight any connoiseur of fungii.  More
capable lifesystems are possible.  These are also prohibatively expensive
and do not address the more fundamental limitation of volume: Eight Worlds 
ships are very small, not much larger than a modern airliner.  Would YOU 
want to live aboard a modern airliner for more than a week?  If your 
answer is yes, go to the local video store, rent a copy of DAS BOOT, watch 
it, and think again.
     The Derelict Endurance of Eight Worlds ships is, of course, quite
long.  These ships are not going to evaporate, they are made out of nice
durable materials such as steel (Why not?  It\'s cheap and it doen\'t burn.
These are valuable characteristics.  Oh, there may also be an aeroshell
of some refractory material but this is a cosmetic item: it merely 
insures that the vessel does not become disfigured during re-entry).
On the other hand, they are not likely to remain where they can be
found.  Since most ship opperations (and all combat) are conducted at 
speeds greater than typical planetary escape velocities, derelicts
tend to spin off into interplanetary or interstellar space.  The
detection range of Eight Worlds sensors is a paltry 300,000 km or so.  
Interplanetary space is somewhat larger than this.

     The discerning individual will wonder why I chose such endurance
limits.  He or she will wonder on what physical justification these
limits are based.  The answer is simple:
     I am, of course, far to lazy and unimaginative to create a truly
civilization.  I therefore elected to take a historical civilization and 
transpose its culture and technology into SF terms.  But I did not wish 
to chose a well-known civilization lest my players exclaim, "My my, Gazis 
has based this culture on the aboriginal societies of Papua, New Guinea,"
and laugh at me.  Fortunately, I have long been fascinated by the
civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean.  These civilizations were
defined by their shipping, which shipping had important limitations. 
(These civilizations also were centered around self-sufficient city-states,
which are a good analogue for planetary states.)  It was a simple matter
to devise specific impulses, specific power outputs, and reactor 
efficiencies so that Eight Worlds shipping had analogous limitations.
     Unfortunately... I goofed.  There is another historical 
civilization which placed great importance on its navies, and possessed
ships with endurances such as I have described:
     European civilization at the turn of the century.  
     Space 1909.  Ick.

     The two messages are, as always:

     1) Opperating limitations, like every thing else in a game, should
be consitent with the kind of campaign the GM wants to run.  
     2) I forgot what the second message was

Interesting article from Paul and others prompted this commentary.
Please use any ideas you find interesting and/or suitable.

Strategic endurance on my spacecraft is limited by three factors: fuel,
life support, and power.  Life support is actually the least important
of the three.  My traveller world is set far in the future, and most
of the many alien races humans deal with are even older (like millions
of years) than humanity, which has only had a mere fifty thousand years
to perfect various technologies.  While I do assume some limits on
technology, I believe you could get microtechnology-biotechnology life
support units that could support humans pretty much for years if they
have power (I assume your basic recycler tank masses 500 kg. and uses
about 5 kilowatts and will work pretty much forever as long as you give
it fluids and solids and gases to recycle and power to help run things; 
it\'s basically an organism of sorts, producing water and foodbars, nothing
fancy.)

Power is not too much of a problem, either.  While a fusion generator
will run out of deuterium after a while, you can pack about two years 
worth into any power plant.  Probably more.  

Ah, but fuel, even in super-efficient systems like a fusion drive or 
a matter-antimatter drive, is the big problem.  Run out of fuel and
something very bad happens--you can\'t turn around!  You don\'t run out
of power and die (well, not for a while) but you do float off and have
to wait for someone to rescue you (someone will, spacecraft are valuable
enough that salvage teams can change outrageous fees for chasing after
people who have run out of fuel and need to be rescued).  Most spacecraft
carry between 400 and 800 G-hours of fuel (i.e., hours of fuel at one
gravity of thrust).  Now, even if you use jump drives, this means you
have to be careful.  In my game, where people have to use hypergates
(like Stargates in 2001; ships don\'t carry their own hyperdrives, they
have to go to a hypergate for interstellar transport), you have to be
very careful.

You also have to be careful about what you plan to do.  If you whiz by
an enemy fleet at a thouand klicks per second, relative speed, you\'ll get 
a few shots, but then they\'re gone and it will be quite some time before
you can slow down, turn around, and chase them!  So you need good 
intelligence to tell you where to navigate.  (Mind you, sometimes it\'s
better to do a fast hit-and-run ambush, but not always.)

I have never worried too much about tactical endurance, except for missiles
and chaff (anti-missile confuse-their-scanners junk).  Everything else is
energy weapons.  Waste heat is a problem, but unless both sides are commanded
by total boobs, one side has usually anihilated the other side within a few
minutes (like naval warfare today, spacecraft will probably carry weapons 
where the main gun is big enough to waste anything their own size in one or
two shots--the only exception being battleships which are so big that no 
one shot short of a nuclear blast can destroy the entire thing).

This leads to a new topic of discussion.  As I recall, the old Traveller
space combat tables are very slow.  I have developed a system which, in 
the words of one friend who plays in my game is "brutal, but fair, and 
pretty realistic."  Gaming combat time almost equals playing time, minute
for minute.  What do people think of the various space combat systems
they have encountered, developed, etc.?

Well, I\'ve babbled enough.  Take care everyone, and have happy holidays!

In White Dwarf #70 there is an article about bounty hunting as
a career in Traveller. Included is the floor-plans of a variant
scoutship especially equipped for bounty hunters. It\'s a very
nice, very professionally looking floorplan labeled "TYPE H
HUNTER (SN VARIANT)". The explanations, however, are in terms
of the differences from the standard model, and I\'ve never seen
the plans for that! Does anyone know if these plans have been
published anywhere? There\'s a few issues in the twenties
missing from my White Dwarf collection, so that might be it.

The article was written by Diane and Richard John, and I think
they made the plans in it themselves, so probably they also did
the original plans, but I don\'t know for sure.

As so often happens, there are many standards!  If they\'re referring to their
own "standard" Type S, I can\'t help.  But a type S scout/courier is one of the
ships listed in the supplement "Traders and Gunboats".  This version doesn\'t
work without some changes to the plans; I know, I\'ve built one.  For one thing,
they\'ve left out such minor details as the power plant and the computer.  For
another, where they have put the cargo bay, there isn\'t room, due to the
tapering of the hull.  I put the forward undercarriage leg there instead, and
put the cargo bay just to port of the main engines.  The power plant now sits
in a little compartment just under the main engines.  I also enlarged the
bridge, and the computer and ship\'s locker now fit in there.

Happy Christmas, everyone!

Yes.  I paid the megaBucks for megaBox trav just to get the Tasks system,
and to bought the companion book just for the Insystem rules, to add to 
GURPS in general and GURPS Space respectively.

Haven\'t tried to integrate it yet, but it looks like it should work fine.

I bought GURPS Space, because I\'m using GURPS for a fantasy campaign,
and I thought to loan it to my Traveller GM.  If I ever run a space
game, I\'d either use very variant traveller (see Redden & Gazis
postings) or GURPS Space, possibly a mutant mix.  Or N. Shapiro\'s Other Suns,
formerly pub\'ed by FGU, soon to reappear as share-ware or something.  (See
USENET rec.games.frp discussion; if someone\'s interested, I might be able
to post a digest from my unix account -- send to wdr@wang.wang.com)

What follows is my review of GURPS Space, followed by a copy of the self
promotional back cover blurb  therefrom. 

GURPS Space is a generalization of GURPS Humanx: it gives several taxonomies
(Chinese menus) for building an SF campaign: pick your technological future.
They list multiple different ways around the FTL problem, and give hints
as to how each affects a campaign.  Also menued: How is your galaxy/cluster/
known space ruled?  (campaign type, with references!)  What sort of
people go adventuring?  How do you navigate in space?  Power? Commo?
Weaponry?  Design your own race.

Default energy density of power-cells looks less whacky than most systems.
Weapons span many traditions, GM should pick sublist based on above
choices, and weapon-legality in culture (like TRAV LAW level).  But much
better variety: eg, electromag mortar, tanglers, vibroblades; power
holster.  Likewise, Armor pans more sub-genre.

Starships are computed in cubic YARDS.  (*yech* I guess metrics haven\'t
reached texas, or SJ was afraid of putting off the innumerate brats who
buy games at the corner store.)  Sidebar says 200Tonner is slang for 200
cubic-yard hull, not to be confused with component mass, ship mass, etc
which are weights at 1G.  They figure loaded mass = light mass + rated
cargo mass.  Ship design looks simpler & saner than MegaTrav, and more
flexible than 3-book trav.  (I don\'t know the supplements, since my GMs
use the Gazoid system.)  Subsection: required crew, getting a ship
without buying it, reaction mass for trips of different lengths, STL
colony ships, GravTech, Auxiliary Craft (pretty skimpy). 

Ship to ship combat looks reasonable for an RPG; it is *not* a war-game sub
game (although one might claim the melee rules are).  They are very
similar to the GURPS Horseclans mass-battle rules, in terms of supply
ways for significant characters\' skills to affect the larger battle and
the larger battle and character skills to affect the character\'s
survival etc.  
     Phases: 1. tactics. 2. Assign firepower & target selection, based
in part on tactics result. 3. Point defense gunnery (if using missiles).
4. Attack Gunnery (affected by 1,2,3) 5. Compute ship damage (direct
results of 4); PC\'s in areas taking damage must make survival rolls. 6.
Damage Control.
	If still in range, Go To Phase 1:, but ignore Plans unless
regrouping occurs; in which case consider it a new battle.
	When out of range, "each PC and important NPC must make a
survival roll". Heroism and Caution options allow PCs to tradeoff succes
and survival on damage control and some other tasks. Failure of a
survival roll doesn\'t kill automatically (as it would in TRAV roll-up,
but results in some number of dice of damage.

"* Science-fiction gadgets, weapons, and medical technology.
"* Starship construction rules from TL8 (just around the corner) to
TL15+ (science fantasy).
"* Quick but detailed /abstract/ ship combat rules -- no ship ocunters,
just roleplaying ... [sic] for a quick determination of fleet damage,
individual ship damage, and injury [and contribution of !] characters.

"/GURPS Space/ does not tie your game to a single background.  Rather,
it is designed for the creative GM who wants to develop his /own/
universe! This book presents a wide variety of choinces and background
information, to let you recreate your favorite science fiction
background -- or build your own, from the homeworld out.

"* Choose the scale of your compaign -- one star system, or a million.
"* Choose the type of campaign you want to run -- space pirates or Star
Patrol, hard-working merchangs or hard-bitten mercenaries, clever
smugglers or starry-eyed explorers, humans or aliens.
"* Choose the political background -- from scattered independet worlds,
through a loos Alliance or Federation, to a star-spanning Empire.  Or
perhaps you\'d prefer a Corporate State, run by big business.  It\'s all here.
"* Choose the technological background -- from a wide variety of
startdrives, power plants, and weaponry -- to give the campaign the
scope and flavor you choose.

"Years in the making [ie years behind schedule], /GURPS Space/ is
essentially a survey of the whole space-adventure genre as it relates to
roleplaying.  If you\'re ready to create your own future ...[sic] it\'s yours.

[fine print] "This book is designed for use with the /GURPS Basic Set/,
but can be used as a sourcebook for any roleplaying game in outer space.
