>Exactly!  Which means the CHARACTER(it being the more IMPORTANT
element than
>the player in this debate) would then be in the total control
(really, it
>always was...) of the GM, the "god" of the universe.

The blunt response : Until the player beats the shit out of the GM,
stopping only when the GM will do whatever the player wants,  , at
which point the player is now god of the universe.

However, here\'s a reasoned counter-argument. The GM does not have the
final say over the "existence" of his universe. It only "exists" when
there are players willing to play in it. If no-one plays, there is no
"universe". If the GM makes use of his "power" in any way in which a
majority of the players disagree, it is likley he will lose all power
because the game will not continure, and therefore neither will the
"universe".
Thus while the GM may have "ultimate power"  (as ET\'s freind  would
say ), he only gets to excercies it if his players let him.

Second counter argument : I have often played in campaigns where most
of the players also GM\'d the same "universe". In these cases people
often controlled certain aspects of the game ( for instance in my
current mage game I leave all decisions and rulings with regard to
werewolves to one of my players who is far more ofay with the Werewolf
rules than I am, and another player is running a secondary campagin in
the same universe ) Thus, the GM may _not_ have "ultimate power" in
all circumstances.

>>"this is stupid, I\'m leaving".
>
>And they would cease to have any role in their character\'s
development IN
>THAT UNIVERSE, showing how powerless the player is, compared to the
GM/
>"god"/"mighty one".

Except they could easily take the _same_character_ and use it another
game that was run by another GM
Or start one of their own, in which the character becomes an important
NPC.

They then say the _real_ character is one they\'ve kept, the other is
just a pale imitation created in a hurry by the previous GM to try and
disguise the fact that the character just disapppeared from "THAT
UNIVERSE". How does the poor old GM prove otherwise ? The simple
answer is he can\'t, because the player owns the character.

Of course in a mature, non-totalitarian game, the GM (or "facilitator"
as I prefer to call her ) and the player_share_ control of the
character.

>The debate isn\'t about whether you care, but about whether the GM is
in the

This all assumes that you\'re using a rules system (or a game contract)
that does not allow the players to control the universe as well. For
instance the "plot points" of Theatrix allow the player to tell the GM
what happens in a scene. The GM has no choice ( according to the
rules) but to accept the players description of events.

Then there\'s Amber.....

I\'ve never gone into a game assuming either I or the GM was a god.

Well, except for that Runequest game about the GodWars, and that other
game where I played the god of War, and managed to embarass the god of
Sleaze....

no I was talking about in the game only.  He also said a number of 
things that got responses from others on the TML.  Since they disagreed 
with Clif\'s ideas and GMing style, he countered by putting them down 
("stupid probing", "It went right over your head, blind man", "Duh!", 
and so on) or he \'didn\'t say that/ had qualified that\'.  If anyone tried 
to defend against his putdowns of their games he responded by saying 
"There you go patting yourself on the back, again.", "Yeah, yeah, pat 
yourself on the back.", and "Means nothing to me to hear you toot your

"I won\'t belabour it by rehashing the points I made which you

it\'s a bad analogy and most GMs who refer to themselves as "gods" have 
delusions of grandeur.

Clif will probably make some condescending or qualifying response.  It 
won\'t make much difference, I think most of you understand my point.

I\'ve got a friend who is a biker. He works a regular job, but he still
drops by the clubhouse occasionally, and his job is such that he still
has the beard and long hair. He also has a concealed carry permit. 

It used to be that on a fairly regular basis he\'d notice a cop
following him for a few blocks, and then he\'d get pulled over for a
"routine traffic stop" for some minor thing or another. He figured it
was just because he "looked suspicious".

He noted that after he got the permit, things changed a bit. Now he
sees the cop start following, and then the cop generally quits
following. 

He figures that this is because when they run his plates, the concealed
carry permit comes up, and they decide that they\'ve got better things
to do than bother somebody that they "know" has a gun. :-)

that the PC\'s undertook completely voluntarily.   Indeed they were the
aggressors.  They had been hired by one nation on a balkanized world to fight
another.   The situation was that the entire world had funded a defense
satellite with a big nuclear missile bay (TL-8 MT) and the treaty stated that
it would be used against any attack on any nation that took place from space.
The PC\'s had a choice, land their troops and fight out the ticket using ground
forces alone OR attack the station and, if they won, they would be able to use
their ship  to provide ortillery.   They just couldn\'t resist the option of
using their ortillery and got their ship cracked wide open.   I couldn\'t
justify anything except a big explosion since the attack was made with a big
nuclear weapon bay.

I\'ve heard dark, giggling rumors about how a certain enactment of the

and use it for their getaway.  I wasn\'t there at the time, but perhaps
someone who was could explicate further?

In my semi-defunct Sayat writeups, the Mi-Go in fact menaced the Sayat and
their neighbors in recent historical times.  Hard-Trav explanation:  they

Description

This is the most powerful handgun in the high-tech limited edition 
Performance Excel line that A&O have produced to date. The price 
(3500Cr) means that only a select crowd will have the possibility to own 
the weapon (nobles, filthy rich types, travellers and PC:s that is). The 
muzzle energy is equal to the archaic TL:8 7.62mm Nato _Rifle_ a calibre 
that on Terra/Sol was used among other things to hunt a large herbivore 
known as elk/moose.

All Performance Excel weapons comes with a pair of really cool 
sunglasses, which can be uses to project the picture from a camera under 
the barrel (house rule –1 to hit/3 aimed shots, the camera replaces the 
laser-sight), and can be customised for no or little extra cost on the 
request from the buyer. You can of course get it in any colour you want 
(silver with pearl handgrip), triton night-sight, ammo counter etc. The 
only thing that is impossible to get is extra quality (‘case _that’s 
impossible – A&O Lead Designer). 

The default gun is black with a matted furnish. The unusually large 
barrel with the underlying laser-sight is, together with the strange 
design of the somewhat blocky receiver, the trademark of a Performance 
Excel handgun. The A&O quality seal are on Performance Excel weapons 
made of gold, silver, platinum or (some other metal preferably black – 
Iridium? any ideas? Help wanted).

The laser sight is a scaled down version of the usual lasersight-12.

I don’t know about you but I’m going cobold hunting.

Dawkins used it as an example in one of his popular evolution books (The 
Extended Phenotype?) (IIRC the reference was Cairns-Smith).

There are examples in nature of creatures carrying more than just their 
DNA into the next generation.

The idea of a cell/nucleus with an embedded radiation shield/protector 
sounds biologically possible, probable even in these circumstaces. Any 
Geneers on the list care to comment?

It\'s also quite likely that we will find ways of promoting DNA repair 
mechanisms out of the current research into cancer.

This brings back memories - my first boat was still under construction when
I reported aboard, and I later had to get used to certain changes (after
they put in the wall between the torpedo room and 21-man, for instance - it
was originally easier to walk through that space than through where the
door was).

When I left Norfolk for Pearl, though (1986), Newport News was building
bird farms (aircraft carriers) using the modular system.

Just for the record, on a 688 class SSN:

   - The skipper has a stateroom which probably measures (I\'m at home now,
so I can\'t check) about 8\'x6.5\'.  This includes a bunk which folds up into
the wall, a table with two chairs (which form the supports for the bunk
when it is opened up), and a desk.
   - The XO has a stateroom which is about the same size.  It includes a
double bunk (the spare is used by senior riders, as when the commodore
decides to visit for a day or few) and a desk.
   - Department heads and senior division officers are in three three-man
staterooms, maybe a wee bit smaller than the XO\'s.  Each includes a triple
bunk, two fold-down desks, and various lockers (which are used mainly for
storing paperwork, not personal gear).
   - The twelve senior CPOs share a berthing space which is basically four
triple bunks - two on each side of a passage that\'s not quite as wide as a
bunk.  (Call it 8\' x 13\', at a guess.)  Attached is a small lounge (maybe
8\' x 8\'), which is mostly taken up by a table with banquettes around it.
   - The remaining crew are in four berthing spaces:
      - forward berthing (24 bunks)
      - aft berthing (39)
      - the 9-man bunkroom (take a guess)
      - the 21-man bunkroom (ditto)
All berths are triple bunks (some slightly smaller than most).  Each space
also includes a few lockers, mostly for personal gear but some for
equipment.  (The ship\'s divers, for instance, have a good-sized locker in
after berthing.)  JOs who don\'t live in the staterooms live in the 9-man;
CPOs who aren\'t in the goat locker usually berth in 9-man or forward berthing.

This adds up to a total of 117 racks (including the spare in the XO\'s
stateroom), for a crew of around 130-135.  Temporary racks (usually six)
can be set up in the torpedo room if we don\'t have a full weapons loadout
(the racks go on the weapon stows).  Junior personnel hotrack, of course -
normally three people for two bunks - and there are almost always people
left behind when we get under way, whether on leave, in school, or whatever.

Oh, yeah - heads:

   - The CO and XO share one (one shower, one toilet, and a fold-up sink in
each stateroom).
   - The three wardroom staterooms share one (one shower, one toilet, one
urinal, one sink, plus a fold-up sink in each of the three staterooms).
   - The goat locker has its own head (one shower, one toilet, two sinks).
This is also used by some of the CPOs who live in other berthing spaces,
but they\'re just as likely to use the middle-level head.
   - Forward and aft berthing are connected by the middle-level head (two
showers, three toilets, one urinal, four sinks).  This is also used by
enlisted types from 9-man; officers, of course, use the wardroom head.
   - 21-man uses the lower-level head (one shower, one toilet, two sinks).

As for common areas, the goat-locker lounge has already been mentioned.
The officers have the wardroom (maybe 15\' x 9\'), which is mainly taken up
by the table (the CO\'s chair at one end, four chairs along one side,
banquettes along the other end and side).  The crew\'s mess (maybe 17\' x
20\') has three 4-man and two 6-man tables, and the serving line.  Wardroom
and crew\'s mess are used as dining rooms, of course, and between meals as
lounges, lecture halls, conference rooms, &c.  (The wardroom table also
serves as the corpsman\'s operating table in case of an emergency.)

One galley serves everyone.  Officers normally eat in the wardroom (there
are occasions when JOs may be eating out with the crew), and the enlisted
crew eat on the mess decks; one of the 6-man tables is normally reserved
for CPOs (and the very rare stray JO).

Headroom in all spaces is somewhere around six feet - I\'m 5\'10, and can hit
my head on overhead lights in some places if I\'m not careful.

You bet, especially when the 3rd year med student came in and asked me how

I think there would be a strong market for VR-based systems ala _Dream

boredom.

Well, the Darrians are a client state ;-) and Reft doesn\'t actually have
any solomani worlds in it ;-)

But if you look at the MT maps defining the sectors with each Domain you\'ll
see what I mean. I think we can probably accept the Imperium has given up
on taking Zho space, but you could argue that they\'ve annexed part of the
Sword Worlds...

So, although these systems may be independent of the Imperium, any Imperial
controlled system within the defined Domain limits is under the Arch Duke\'s
wing.

Walt explained it more clearly than I did.

Normal T4 combat is deadly, and doesn\'t have the risk of running out of AP
to react that ACQ has. My players had a healthy aversion to firearms (and
as crew of a merchant ship sacked a colleague who insisted in waving a
snub-auto around and threatening people).

In six months, playing once a week we only had one real gunfight, which
hospitalised one player. The Only starship fight they had left them with a
2 MCr bill for repairs.

My real feeling of success came when the players got more twitchy about
restaurants than gunfights :-)

My last sustained campaign ended when one of the characters (the ship\'s
steward) fiance (the ship\'s pilot) died in a mugging. (*) The party had
been through hell; the captain unable to hack it and turning to drink, the
ship stuck in a high port due to Navy activity, the Aslan Engineer insulted
by the captain, the \'management trainee\' merchant in hospital from a pirate
hit on his turret. The steward was pregnant, and the second engineer was an
IISS agent (Vilani) who had infiltrated the group to investigate rumours of
a visit to an interdicted world. The death of the pilot, just after the
whole party had started to pull together again was devastating to us all
emotionally (as players as well as characters). We ended the game the next
session as no one could get out of the down:

The Aslan Engineer quit after the Captains\' insult.
The Steward quit the ship with the Aslan after the Captain\'s insult and her
partner\'s death.
The trainee was in hospital.
The Scout was okay, but the captain had a breakdown.

It was quite a shock to the system.

Dom

(*) The player had other commitments and wanted out of the game, so we
planned this out some time before.

That\'s pretty much summarised in the book but not in as much details. ISTR
that the clathrates are one of the possible mechanisms to explain the
losses of ships/planes in the Bermuda Triangle.

TNE combat is not by far as deadly, but after only a few sessions my players
are really starting to avoid combats as far as they can. And their hired
as mercenaries to perform a smash and grab pre-strike mission. They have
only low power weapons and have noticed that the TED on thsi world has
some seroius fire power, so they are moving very slowly and considering
their moves very carefully.

We have so far had two real gunfights in four sessions. The first was a
ambush by some tugs (think Mel Gibson "Mad Max" like gang) in some ruins.
Low tech weapons against a team of trained militaries. So it wasn\'t that
dangerous. The second was an ambush set up by the players on an contra-grav
APC. This left one characther killed (he was actually only seriously hurt, but
the guy playing him had to throw in his towel due to work. He is still playing
with us, just not as often). After this their making damn sure that if
their getting into a firefight their going to have the upper hand.

>My real feeling of success came when the players got more twitchy about

After my players saw a display of some surface to surface missiles
from the local TED, their going to stay away from combat until it
is unavoidable. The sight of armed people really makes them nervous.

I wasn\'t in that one, but I\'ve had players hide in the landing-gear
wells until night and then jump out to steal the brooch.  I was being a
spoil-sport that game, and ruled that the engines had been removed to
cut down on the weight, so that it could be hung from the ceiling.

You mean like lightning bolts? There\'s this thing called "persistence

Not true. High power beams actually ionize the air they pass thru. I\'ve
seen photos of the results. It looks like a bad special effect. You get
"globs" of ionized gas of various sizes and shapes scattered randomly
but densely along the beam path. 

And these were beams that while *dangerous* were *not* up to the energy
densities required for weapons.

If you are building in orbit, the lack of gravity makes things quite a
bit different than on the ground or in a body of water. 

You don\'t *need* the hull to hold things together. You can build out
from the "center" far more easily. Add load bearing members as it is
convenient. And then add the outer hull *last*. This way, items that
will *never* get removed from the ship (such as casings for the M-drive
or the J-drive) won\'t need to be installed thru "hard patches". 

And modular construction gets easier too. The modules no longer need to
have a "face" that they can be "set down" on while they are waiting to
be put in place. That saves bracing, and puts fewer restrictions on the
shape of the module. 

I expect that even "custom" ships will contain a lot of standard
modules. After all, which is cheaper, allocating a bit more space and
installing a pair of engines that together are somewhat more than you
need? Or having a custom built engine installed?

I wonder if anyone can dig up info on the phsyical properties of the
clathrates? If they are denser than ice, we may have a new candidate
for use as fuel in the "ignore the weight, I want low volume!" type of
ships. :-)

Exploring a world in the Hyades cluster, they find a planet with a
large lake. Possibly with ruins around it (I forget). If there are
ruins, they may find some symbols that translate as "HALI" that
apparently refer to the lake. They are surprised that the database
match for the characters is from ancient *Earth*. 

If they poke around enough, they may find characters that spell out
another name. Said characters will have been covered over or otherwise
defaced. It\'ll take technical skills to recover them. 

Of course, this won\'t matter if they tried exploring the lake. Any
moderate disturbance of the lake (say landing the ship on it to
wildreness refuel, as opposed to simply runninf a hose out to it) will
draw the attention of the Inhabitant of the Lake.

If they do recover and translate the name, just remember that He Who Is
No To Be Named usually waits until the third time his name is spoken by
a person. 

Tom: "Hastur? Why does that sound familar?"
     "Dick! Does \'Hastur\' mean anything to you?"
Dick: "Nope."
Tom: "Why does that seem so familar? Let\'s see what the computer thinks..."

Until the present budget troubles of many Canadian forces *everything*
eventually went into the joint US/Canada police databases. However we
didn\'t *check* it for minor crimes. On a couple of occassions information
on minor crimes in the database came in useful when there were difficulties
with the major crime being investigated. It\'s quite frightening what\'s in
that database. And, yes, the first thing almost everyone does when cleared
for access is look up their friends and family. Definitely illegal.

Great post.  While ships are good, a good NPC will always come in handy.

Have you used Dr. Dukagen in an active adventure?  And did he live through
it?  NPCs in my games had the distressing habit of being the ones thrown in
jail, shot or otherwise put in between the PCs and harms way (which is as
good a use as any, from a pragmatic viewpoint).
I don\'t have an active campaign right now (as you can see I have plenty of

months and contained 7 regular players with 16 character deaths, Two
players) that incorperated Call of Cthulu and went into quasa-fantasy, the
players ran into an Art thief who turned out to be much more then a mere
art collector. Eventually the players while investigating monolithic
remains on a rogue planet (planet not orbiting a star) finally learned the
FATE OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE if they failed to stop this well entrenched,
very long lived villian. 
	During one episode, the players while investigating a rumour, found a
planet that was surrounded by rotating warp anomilies. two players collided
with a anomilie and found themselves 50,000 years in the past, in the
middle of another intersteller war. These two players accidentally
contributed to the death of an entire planet because of something they told
the freedom fighters of that era. (Now I was running Two different tech
sci-fi games, same basic story, different times) One player (in the past)
convinced the scientist of that era to set up a research installation to
try to use the warp anomilies as travel conduites, an accident happened
(critical failure) and this player was projected yet another 50,000 years
into the past where he became trapped on a planet populated by the CoC
Elder ones. (Now I have three seperate SciFi games, same players) He then
accidentally created the main villian (\'loose lips sink ships\' sort of
thing.) 
	Eventually he escaped the planet, went around spreading weapons technology
and was hunted by most of the planets that survived his gifts. He was known
as the angel of death. His actions became the reason the present had so
many planets that contained ruins of civilizations that appeared to have
nuked themselves from existance.

	It was a fun game, since I got to test out some extreme story ideas and
the players had so much to try to unravel, I wrote a 250 page diary they
found, with pictures, discriptions, codes, locations, I even made up a
strange written language for them to decipher. (one player vowed to write a
program to \'break\' my language, unfortunalty for him I used several one
word to describe multiple word phrases. Fortunalty for them I had the the
rosetta broken into several locations in the diary.) During one funeral
scene a player actually cried over the death of an NPC. One player had his
mind psionically switched with another NPC. 
"WHAT?! NOOOOOO!!!!! I was so macho! Now I am a woman!" He screamed!
"?!?" the female players turned on him. "My character has a knife, want to
cut your throat now?"
 
	 I will be starting part two (20 years later) of that game, this one will
be using Traveller as it\'s backdrop. Unfortunalty the original players will
not be in it do to other obligations. Hmm if anyone is interested I can do
it as a EPBM. This ofcourse will be the only time I ask, I do not want to
take up the list space (anymore then I normally do) :> And the turns will
not be sent to the list.

I was flipping through the GT material in my FLGS yesterday and i\'m certain
i saw plans for the type S Scout in Gurps: Traveller (just before the
Beowulf). I noticed it because they managed to get the three decks into the
hull whereas they don\'t fit given \'canon\' deck heights and \'canon\' scout
exterior dimensions. The ship did look thicker in the accompanying beauty
illustration. Also the lower deck was longer and the shape of the upper
deck was changed.

Isn\'t that only if the "line" exists long enough to register to the human
eye/mind?

To see a line, wouldn\'t the room have to be filled with dust or smoke?

I picture a combat laser being much like a larger sized version of one of
those eye or hair removal surgical lasers.  It "pops" and you see the light
only where it terminates.

It would be nice if you could share a picture of it with us.

With all this discussion about GMing style someone brought up the point 
about the game contract.  There is a good web page that details how to 
make such a contract at http://www.addr.com/~rpghost/play_contract.html
You might want to check out the rest of the web site while you\'re there.  
It has a play by post section to it that looks pretty good.

There is also a good page describing roleplaying styles at

Just coincidentally, our local museum was broken into two weeks ago and a valuable brooch stolen (this is absolutely true). The existence, location and layout of what is basically a small municipal museum had been broadcast on national TV as a piece of basically tabloid journalism on how the brooch\'s founder had been "cheated" of his find (using a metal detector illegally in the town park). 

Police have no leads but suspect the local Vargr element.

ACQ is probably the next BITS supplement to be published; a combat system
inspired by Azhanti High Lightning and Snapshot, written for T4 by Doug
Berry with James Lindsay. Having read the draft I can say it looks
excellent.

Why probably? Because GURPS Traveller Shipyard\'s MacOS version may be
released first, depending on the time it takes to get confirmation from SJG
for licencing issues.

ACQ stands for \'At Close Quarters\'.

With the widget it tastes better than the bottled version. It tastes like a

The undamaged ones are used as templates for repairing the damaged one. This
is the great thing about complementary DNA strands...single strand breaks are
realtively simple to repair. DS breaks are harder, but do happen on a regular
basis. Likely what would happen in a organism with many copies of the genome
is that damage would cause that strand to be flagged for degradation, and
another strand created from templates of the good ones, so there\'s actually
not as much repair as simple replacement.

Probably - and lesser nobles (other members of the Imperial
Family, Archdukes, Sector Dukes, and so on) probably make similar
appointments, with correspondingly less prestige, but prestige
nonetheless.  And it\'s entirely possible that different nobles
will choose different purveyors for the same essential purpose -
thus, the "Purveyor of Fine Vilani SHaashliik to His Imperial
Majesty" may not be the PoFVSH to _Her_ Imperial Majesty (the
Emperor\'s wife).  She may even find His purveyor\'s stuff to be
totally nauseating; she has her own taste.

The only thing that you can be sure of is that a selected
purveyor will be from the region over which the appointing noble
has direct control.  Thus, no Antarean operation will ever be the
Purveyor of ... to His Grace the Archduke of the Domain of
Deneb"; that honor will go to a Domain of Deneb operation, even
if that operation must work with the Antarean guys to get that
special blend of Githiaskio algæ-tea.

Um ...
	- coil it loosely in your hand, much as the installers do
	- coil it on the roll it comes in
	- coil it on a special case that comes with the weapon
	- coil it around your helmet

In short, coil it just about any freaking way you like, as long as
you don\'t bend it beyond the critical point. And if it\'s a weapon
system, it\'s not TOO far fetched to postulate some kind of
semiflexible covering which will prevent it from being bent too far.
One MIGHT assume weapons designers are aware of most of the
vulnerabilities of the materials they propose using, unless they\'re
morons who wouldn\'t be designing weapons in the first place.

Thats what they call Squadie proffing. A mate of mine is working on a
battlefield computer system and they had to Squadie proof it. Take one
standard labtop, encase it in 4" of steel reinforced rubber with a anti shock
system, redesign the display for weather proofing, touch screen with gloves
etc etc etc. You could take this labtop and throw it out of a two toner at 20
miles an hour and it would still be in working.

Any weapon system, or equipment that isn\'t squadie proofed just isn\'t going to
be deployed in the field. It wouldn\'t survive loading, let alone battle if it
was not.

I think there would be a strong market for VR-based systems ala _Dream

Nope, if the total energy is high enough to trigger the rods or cones
in your eyes, you can "see" even nano-second light pulses. Lightning
bolts don\'t last more than milliseconds. And they travel at close to
lightspeed. 

> To see a line, wouldn\'t the room have to be filled with dust or smoke?

Again, no. The "tiny" portion of the energy that the air absorbs is
enough to ionize it. And when the ionized atoms return to their "ground
state" microseconds later, they give off light.

The air absorbs a tiny amount of the energy. At above something along
the lines of a MW per square cm, the air gets ionized.

Removing the engines damages the exhibit. But there *no* way there\'s
going to be *any* LH2 in the tanks. So they may be able to power the
ship up from internal battery backups (which could be kept charged to
provide lighting and power for the times when they run tours of the
ship. 

Even better, there\'s probably a module installed in the computer "bay"
that reports *as if* the ship was flight ready and turns it into a
*big* simulator. 

Just imagine the characters reaction. They\'ve scrambled into the ship,
closed the hatch, and mad an "emergency liftoff". They are heading out
for the jump point when the buzzer for the airlock sounds. They check
the camera for the lock and it shows a bunch of police standing there,
with the interior of the museum behind them.

"You might as well come out. It\'s running a simulation, and there\'s no
 fuel in the tanks anyway."

Talk about *embarassing*!

VE2 p. 24 says that either a hull is sealed in its entirety or it is not.
Having an open frame hull with individually sealed subcomponents is an
extension of the existing rule.

Yes, of course. Thing I was trying to avoid for GT players without access
to or interest in VE2 was the surface area calculation (SA = 6*vol^2/3) for
each separate compartment or pod. I\'m not sure I want to raise the issue of
pods, however -- that has implications for access space that I don\'t want
to get into.

That is the correct and most accurate way to do this, of course. But once
again, it gets into detailed calculations of surface area. I suppose I may
not be able to avoid this in the end.

Same as missiles, but since they aren\'t particularly useful in GT space
combat I elected to ignore them.

> Shouldn\'t there be 2-in-6 protection against beams to stay VE-compatible?
> 

By a strict application of the rules, yes, but that rule presumes that the
beam diameter is much less than the diameter of an average strut. At the
ranges involved in GT space combat, this is not the case -- the beam is at
least several meters across, and enough would fall through the hull to do
(almost) normal damage.

Strictly speaking, I suppose the rule for beam weapons should be "Use only
1/3 the listed DR against beam weapons that strike the open frame section."
but that begs the question of hits on the sealed compartments vs. on the
open frame. That could be done, using the percent open frame calculated
earlier and the table on p. B45, but again I was looking for playable
simplicity.

Isn\'t that what I said?  "Don\'t bend it too much"?  If your bend radius is
under 8", you\'re risking it.

Oh, like the M2 Bradley doesn\'t have its design flaws.  Like the Patriot
missile was as efficient as it was hailed to be.  I don\'t assume anything

A lot of this will depend on how long (and how much) the military in
question has been using the equipment.

If the military has been running fibre-optic cable from tactical positions to
remote weapons for decades, they will know all about what they can
and can\'t do with it, and will have developed handling tricks the
manufacturer doesn\'t know about. Second, third and fourth generation
gear will take advantage of things learned from earlier equipment, at least
with regard to this particular component. (M-16\'s became notorius for
jammed mechanisms, the gunpowder in the bullets worked fine - guess 
which component was a newer design?) If this is the first time they are
using the technique in combat, it will fail frequently - this is normal.

The Nostromo was a \'Commercial Towing Vessal\' like a jump ship according to

Me too.  Great idea, but perhaps it could be expanded.  What about another
mod or two and say that the ship was designed to have one modules for
various jobs.  Say as a passenger liner/troop ship, bulk carrier,
Qship/corsair, mercenary transport/mixed cargo/passenger.

I would like to see a set of rules for the towing gear of the Jump ship and
Battle rider carriers though.  It is one design feature that has never been
explained in any form of cannon.  The mass/volume/power of the gear for a
given mass/volume/power requirements of cargo.  Plus a few \'cargo mudules\'
for bulk carriers/battler carriers like troop transporters and low birth
colony mass transport.

The Patriot system is an Anti-aircraft missile system JOT\'ed into
anti-missile duty. This was known when they did it. There were some VERY
big political reasons that the Patriot had to _appear_ to work really
well during the Gulf conflict.

We\'re just _very_ lucky that Saddam\'s rocket scientists weren\'t. OTOH,
so is he...the biggest political reason was to keep Israel out of the
war.  Had they entered the situation could well have escalated to
include lots of sand being made into glass.

It would be a good choice as well.  Very interesting ship with a great many

The beams you saw ionizing the air probably were at higher power
densities than Traveller weapons, in that they would have very short
pulses. A weapons laser really, really, really doesn\'t want to 
ionize the air; it degrades the beam quality quite a lot. Traveller
weapons lasers at the listed energies with reasonable pulses won\'t
necessarily exceed the ionization threshold (especially if lasers used
in atmosphere have longer pulses than space-combat lasers.)

Even a beam that doesn\'t ionize the air is generally fairly visible,
though. The 20-W laser we shoot up into the sky for laser guided
astronomical adaptive optics is visible from about a mile away (at
night, anyway) from scatter off of normal air. Persistence of vision
will cause the pulsed Traveller lasers to be similarly visible even
if they don\'t ionize anything.

But would it have been *designed* and built with Q-ship or corsair modules?
 Or, as I think much more likely, would someone be taking an existing ship
and converting it?  I find it difficult to imagine someone\'s walking into a
building yard and saying, "Yes, I\'d like to order a corsair...."

Intelligent sub-species of humaniti, currently native to Jonkeer
(Vincennes/Deneb 1324). The Jonkeereen are the products of extensive geneering
by the Imperial Ministry of Colonisation . The project\'s goal was the creation
of a human subspecies perfectly suited to life in a hostile desert
environment. Begun five centuries ago, the project has proven successful. Over
400 million enhanced humans inhabit Jonkeer, and millions more live on desert
planets throughout the Domain of Deneb and beyond.

The average Jonkeereen is tall, thin, and dark-skinned, much like human
desert-dwellers throughout space. Thorough modifications have moved the
Jonkeereen far from the human norm. A combination of genetic engineering and
adaptive surgery aided the first Jonkeereen; later generations bred true to
the Ministry \'s specifications.

The Jonkeereen\'s adaptations are many. Protective membranes shield his eyes
and ears from windblown sand. Changes to his metabolism allow survival on the
scant resources of arid plains. A highly efficient perspiration system and a
large body surface work to cool him in temperatures often exceeding 50 degrees
C - far above human tolerance. His dark complexion shields him from the
radiation of Jonkeer \'s lurid red sun.

While the Jonkeereen have changed in form, their culture also changed. Their
lifestyle is austere, and many visitors find the local customs harsh. Both
conservatism and cooperation are basic traits of the Jonkeereen mindset. The
Jonkeereen are no longer fully human, and this makes the typical Jonkeereen
aloof, emotionally distant from their cousins.

The local Scout base is engaged in long-term observation of Jonkeer culture
and its departure from human standards.

(The information above is from Hyphen\'s web site.)

Jonkeereen: 25 points
HT+2, Height +6”, Weight -20#
Nictiating Membrane, Temperature Tolerance +6 (30-145F)
Chauvinistic, Chummy, Hidebound

Note that Jonkeereen do not depart drastically from human norms.  I think
Jonkeereen can be played as something between subsaharan Arficans and the
Fremen of Dune.  IMTU, the Jonkeereen have converted to Islam, and are waiting
for a leader to unite them...

Corsair is such an ugly word...How about a kinder gentler term, like armed

Trade route patrol craft, Customs inspection ship,...

You SURE these are on the HWIG CD???

"Shoot first and ask questions, later."

- --or--

"Confirm your target and then shoot."

The first philosophy could needlessly end the lives of friendlies; the
second philosophy could get you killed if you meet troops who believe in the
first philosophy.

Also, in T:2000 there was a stat called coolness under fire.

Could the height of your skill level in a combat firearms skills ALSO
determine how cool you were in a firefight?

Like Gene Hackman or Clint Eastwood in "Unforgiven", who both seemed to be
posterboys for their truism that it isn\'t so much being quick on the draw,
but being cool enough to point where you want the bullet to go.

Their coolness under fire was proportional to their skill with their
weapons.

Also, I\'m wondering, if a GM used skill level to determine how cool a
character was flying a jet or shooting a weapon, should you assign modifiers
based on the most superior weapon being employed by the enemy?

For example:  (Highest being most nerve-wracking)

Close Range/Indoors:

Grenade
Machinegun
SMG
Rifle, Shotgun
Pistol

Long Range/Outdoors:

Grenade
Machinegun
Rifle
SMG
Shotgun
Pistol

There would be a modifier equal to the number of levels up or down to the
opposing weapon.

This would represent the suppressive fire put out by the superior weapon.  A
suppressed character would only be able to seek and cower behind cover and
"spray and pray".

I know I don\'t have to ask for criticism.

This would be especially cool as, in my opinion, not a lot of shipyards
build vessels knowing damned well that they\'re designed as pirates.  (Aside

As it is asked, this question is a bit unclear. Do the people who shoot
first shoot accurately, or do they just shoot faster? How fast are those
that confirm their targets, and do *they* shoot accurately? Because of
questions like this, you cannot say which of the above represent a higher
skill level. However, if you rephrase it:

"Which school of thought represents a higher skill level?

"\'Shoot fast\'

"--or--

"Shoot accurately\'"

Then it is obviously the latter. As they say, you can\'t miss fast enough.

The higher skill level, IMO, shoots both faster *and* more accurately than
the lower skill level.


[snip]

>For example:  (Highest being most nerve-wracking)


IMO, the difficulty with this (in game terms) is quantitatively defining
what is "scarier." Is it really less nerve-wracking to be fired upon by a
pistol than a machine gun, assuming you are in a situation where either can
hit you and end your life?

I\'d just fudge it, without coming up with hierarchical lists. Of course, YMMV.

Let me be more explict - a thin strand of fibre is reasonably flexible, a
point I was trying to make by observing that you can coil the fibre optic.
You wouldn\'t need that big a fibre to transmit data to and from a remote
weapon.

But if it\'s a reasonably mature technology like say, fibre optics being
used for communications, they may well have thought about this. I mean, the
telcos in the US and UK have been using this stuff for quite a while now.
Remember this stuff is being manhandled in the field by navvies who don\'t
treat it with kid gloves.

When you look at a 50m run for a remote shot it probably doesn\'t need a
tight bend radius anyway.

From an engineering sense, there is a world of difference between a small,
mechanically simple device like a fibre optic cable and something like an
M2. However, with contracts if you have a lousy specification you\'ll get
what you asked for. Most of the effort in project management of engineering
is getting the specs right, with a good plan and filing system the rest
will follow.

Well, GT is set in 1120, and the canon universe was identical until 1116
when Dulinor got blown up by £**^)^&_FNORD&(*&)@£, so Tarsus and the CT

Also known in naval circles as the mother ship, the fleet carrier is
a transport and launch facility for heavy fighters.  Its main purpose
is the carriage of FHs across interstellar distances to the site of
battle.  In peace, the fleet carrier is a mobile port and repair
facility for its brood; in war, it is a formidable fleet element to
be respected.

Defenses: The fleet carrier depends on its phalanx of three hundred
fighters for the majority of its protection.  Typically, one third of
the fighter force is in flight at any one time.  In addition,
however, the ship can defend itself with its extensive armament -
especially its missile salvos.  In practice, the fleet carrier\'s low
armour rating and speed make it vulnerable and clumsy in battle, and
it will join combat only to ensure recovery of its brood.

Ground Support: The ship\'s meson guns and particle accelerators can
be used against ground targets, as can its missile racks and laser
batteries.  Generally this type of ground support occurs only in the
final stages of a battle, when things are being mopped up.  Doctrine
would preclude risking the ship early in a battle when there is
potential disaster of surface-based return fire.

Evolution: The fleet carrier is an example of the continuing
evolution of starship functions.  In this case, it represents a
splitting off of the fighter carrier operations of older battleships,
placing the responsibilities all in a single ship designed for the
purpose.  Where once a large dreadnaught would carry regiments of
troops, phalanxes of fighters, and myriad weapons mounts, current
practice is to split these various tasks into individual ships.
Naval doctrine is to carry troops on troop transports, fighters on
fighter carriers, and large weapons for the line of battle on
battleships.

Class Names: The Antiama class fleet carriers are named for empresses
and consorts from Imperial history.

In this case either mode is more of a tactical decision, and have little
to do with the skill level of the shooter. It is a question of using
supressive or aimed fire; both are valid tactics, both have their place
in an experienced combat shooters repertoire.

I\'d say the higher skill level is the one who does it better, no matter
which they are using.

Between a SEAL team and a green platoon doing supressive fire, I\'d be
much more afraid of the SEALs, even though both can kill me, and likely
both will make me keep my ass out of sight.

The SEALs, otoh, will probably nail me the moment I AM in sight so I\'d
be more likely to try to take shots of my own with green troops doing
supressive fire.

The higher skill level is being able to switch between the modes at
will, effectively. Most people without the skill or training (same
thing) will be unable to aim accurately after going full rock \'n\' roll
for much time. 

This is why proper autoweapon discipline is 3-5 shot bursts. You gain
the supressive effect of full auto fire, yet retain much better control
of the weapon.

If I am wrong here, I\'m sure Mark will correct me gently ;-)

Leviathan wasn\'t an asteroid hull. Had redundant drives, though.  A good

The energy deposited by raditation is high enough that it
will generally destroy the molecule at the site where it
is deposited.

Other have mentioned damage by radicals created by radiation,
but it seems to me that it would not too hard to scavange
this and that the main, non-prevenatable, source of problems
is direct cleavage of DNA, but I\'m not a biologist.

You get multiple copies in the same cell.  So when the cell
detects that one is damage, it just replicates a different
strand to replace it.

I\'m not sure why.  I know large genomes are bad.  And I know
that pinetrees probably don\'t have any more expressing
genes than other plants (it this true?).  So the extra
damage must occur at non-expressing sites.  My guess is
that you can\'t always fix cleaved DNA.

Sorry, I saw it on a PBS documentary.  But you probably could
dig up an article on the environmental aspects of Chernobyl
pretty easy...

Based on how trade is presented in Far Trader, I wouldn\'t call a
J3 trader a "trap".  I\'m not saying you shouldn\'t have a J-3
trader, just that I wouldn\'t present it as a "tramp".  Maybe
call it a "small independant liner".

I think this should be done if an when a write-up on the ancients

time may end up causing problems.

Speaking in the royal third-person again, I see ;-)

I really look forward to this. This time is rife with adventure fun.

The initial expansion of the 3I is going strong, they run smack into a
equally powerful interstellar state (the Julian Protectorate). 

All the bitter fruits of the initial stages of the expansion are
starting to ripen (lots of worlds have been through the Zhunastu school
of contact) and there have gots to be thousands, if not millions of
scalawags, carpetbaggers, heroes, lost causes and villains scattered
throughout the huge, porous frontier that is the nebulous edges of the
Third Imperium...

Then again, since this is kinda like how MTU has _always_ been, it\'s not
surprising I look forward to it. ;-)

Neither.

What you have here is a *perception* and *tactics* problem.  Before
bringing the weapon into play, you need to ID the enemy and decide on your
best approach to the problem.

Gun Combat skill covers hitting a target with the weapon.  Whether that
target is on a range at Ft. Carson or the FEBA of the Battle of Grungir IX.

<Shameless ACQ plug>

ACQ handless this by having an action reaction task, and using Action
Points.  In Clif\'s example, the two parties would make perception rolls to
see if they even detected each other.  They could spend some of their AP to
raise the target number of the task.  Assuming that they both detect the
other, they would roll an action/reaction task against each other.. largest
margin between die roll and target number goes first.  When shooting, you
can use AP to improve your target number to simulate aiming.

"Tramp" is the correct technical term for a freighter that does not follow
a preset route or schedule; one that does is called a "liner". Traveller
has used "trader" and "merchant" (respectively) as synonyms, but not
consistently.

What\'s the difference between sending the mail to Loren, cc the list, and
sending it to the list, cc Loren?  Or sending it to the list *and* to Loren?

Incidentally, every time one of the starships posts came across which

Uh oh.  Marc\'s writing in the third person.

Martin II is Emperor (since 195), he\'s 145 and has no heir.  He is third in
the Lentuli line.  He has at least one nephew.

Hmm.  What little MT material I have hints that this may be an entertaining

this came up in a discussion I had last year (after noticing the basis for
it in AM:1), and I was wondering what mechanisms would be used to allow for
the most obvious discrepancies between the two biologies.

  Specifically, would the solution to the different gender birth ratios be
cultural or genetic? Would they ignore it on the basis that Aslanized humans
are fairly rare and just have (human) families within their clans where the
males are over-supervised (except that this would leave potentially more
breeding couples active, depending on how most Aslan families are organized).

  OTOH, maybe the fact that the human males are Aslanized but simply lack
the mass (and dewclaws) of biologically Aslan males could account for a
certain amount of attrition - you only need to lose about half of them to
get back to a 3:1 ratio.

  Hmm, love those survival rolls to survive adolescence :)

<much snipping>

In GURPS, the modifier is called SS (snap shot).  Each projectile 
weapon has a "Skill Level" requirement that allows a character to 
shoot "without aiming."  If the character\'s skill is below the SS 
number, then there is an additional penalty (-4 IIRC) applied to the 
die roll.  Perhaps you could make some conversions from GURPS 
to Traveller.  This SS could represent a "Coolness Under Fire."

Otherwise, I would use:

"Take cover first and then shoot at any unfriendlies"

IMTU, the Civil War was just that, civil.  It was a war of admirals and
fleets, and most worlds were never touched, life went on.  In that kind of
environment, there had to be a great deal of political dealing going on..
why seize the throne if your Chief of Staff is just going to take it away
from you?

Then cam Arbellatra, blazing in from the Marches.  She sets herself up as
Regent, and institutes a search for a legitimate heir.  A real heroine.

Or is she?  What if the Throne is her goal from the start, and the search
is a red herring to lure out and eliminate claimants?  And those Admirals
who survived.. they\'ll all have skeletons in their closets as they scramble
to find a place in the new order.  The doesn\'t escape blame.. why did they
submit to bayonet coronations?  Because they were lobbying potential
Emperors for power, even as they plotted the claimants downfall.

This is Core in the days after the war.. paranoia, suspicion, terror.  

Sounds like fun!

Kenji claims to agree wholeheartedly with Doug.  It also has potential to
tie in with the Marches (home of Plankwell & Arbellatra and her distant
descendant Norris of Regina) for folks whose interests lie there.

Besides, I can\'t imagine there\'s much left of the coreward regions around

Well, I\'ve discussed it with Alan, and we agree.

Antares 198 is perfectly fine by us.  The good ol\' Julians handed the
impies their head, which is not entirely a bad thing.

Post Civil War... Not enough frontier.  Good for intrigue, but you can do
that anywhere.

Interstellar Wars:  Yeah, but part of our brains say First Contact!  Or
before!  But that leads into messy "what actually happens during the 21st
Century" stuff, which causes people to gibber and froth at the mouth. 
(Well, at least those who care...)  So a maybe for this one.

And, our suggestion:  Spinward Marches, Year 100!  Total frontierland.  So
what if the official contact with the Swordies and Darrians didn\'t happen
until later - that\'s only official contact.  We don\'t know what pocket
empires might have existed and fallen during the period.  The earliest
canon maps we have are very sketchy, and don\'t necessarily show
"unofficial" and unrecognised states.  Basically it\'s a playground for
traders, explorers, would-be empire builders, pirates (without messy
Imperial entanglements), mercs and general scumbags.  Yes, and diplomats,
bureaucrats and other intriguers.  It would give people a chance to stick
their fingerprints on the TU in the place that is closest to most peoples\'
hearts.  Mapping would be easy, too.  And the monstrosity known as Fusion
Plus doesn\'t really matter.  There are patches of civilisation too....  Oh,
and of course, there\'s the whole great chunk of existing canon material
that can be plugged in.

From the Library Data:

"Area of Imperial territory, based on four adjacent sectors, generally
under the control of an Archduke.

Emperor Artemsus established six domains in 76. These were to be
administered by
Archdukes, and were designed to better manage the Pacification Campaigns
(76-120).
The Domain of Deneb was established in 589 by Empress Jaqueline I .

The domains of the Imperium are Antares , Deneb , Gateway , Ilelish , Sol ,
 Sylea
(administered directly by the Emperor ), and Vland."

The domains were merely administrative areas, arbitrarily assigned. The far
trailing-rimward corner of Deneb, for instance, is on the other side of the
Great Rift. It is only nominally administered by the Domain of Deneb, is
more properly administered by Gushemege or Ilelish sectors! And yes, the
Darrians and so on ARE covered by the Domain of Deneb. The Domain still
trades and negotiates with them, after all.

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. The diploid number, or \'minimum
info required to build another human\' is therefore 23 X 2 = 46.
Sex cells are haploid - they carry 23 chromosomes (to enable shuffling
of genes, hence the evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction).

Some plants carry multiple copies of their complete chromosomal content.
They are said to be polyploid. Usually they display tetraploidy.

One problem is that the more info you carry, the more mistakes you can
carry too, despite tight proofreading. Errors will always occur, it just
happens rarely.

Another is that radiation can induce frame shifting at the next reading
or repair phase.

Remember that every DNA triplet codes for an amino acid. If you knock
one nucleotide out, you radically change the message.

Recent work also suggests that \'non-coding\' regions (introns) may be
more important than first thought. DNA molecules may have the potential
to behave as enzymes. Catalytic RNAs certainly exist. It\'s early days
yet folks....  

There have been some excellent responses to Andy Akin\'s initial
question, viz. "What features would a lifeform have if it were extremely
radiation resistant?"

The source of the radiation is very important ; does it come from the
star or the planet itself?

If the former, underwater and underground forms will predominate ;
multicelled life capable of living on the surface will develop
relatively late in the planet\'s history.

If the planet itself is unusually radioactive (high concentrations of
actinides or smaller isotopes e.g potassium 42 or 44), the development
of multicellular organisms may not take place at all.

Radioisotopes are not easily differentiable from their ordinary
counterparts in most chemical systems. Elements with similar electronic
activity are problematic e.g. the uptake of strontium instead of calcium
into bone.

To recap :-
Radiation induces damage by two mechanisms :-
i. \'Direct hits\' on sensitive macromolecules - DNA and proteins.
ii. Free radical formation and subsequent cellular injury.

Redundant information storage systems have been discussed, as well as
aggressive \'proof reading\' strategies. The latter can also be applied to
proteins and RNAs with autocatalytic RNAs acting as RNases, for another
\'layer of protection\'.

One could also postulate an enhanced version of the ubiquitin system
which disassembles old or damaged enzymes in most eukaryotes and
bacteria (essentially surveillance proteins).

The heat shock protein system could serve as another model for a
corrective mechanism (inappropriate activation of HSPs has been
implicated in tumourigenesis).

Protection from free radical mediated injury requires very efficient
scavenger systems for superoxide (O^2-), peroxide (forms singlet
oxygen), and possibly hypochlorate (OCl-).

This would lead to defects in immunity against certain organisms which
are susceptible to \'oxidative bursts\'. (e.g. the PCs introduce a mini
Plague of Duskir to the natives).

Enhanced cell-mediated injury would be useful in preventing the
development of cancerous cells, but would have adverse effects
(autoimmunity, hypersensitivity). The balance between the relative
efficacy of intracellular protection and extracellular protection needs
to be decided upon.

Cells are most vulnerable to radiation at the time they divide. DNA
synthesis is easily wrecked.
Rapidly dividing cells are the most sensitive to radiation e.g. bone
marrow and lining of the gut.

I would suggest that most of the organism\'s tissues would \'turn over\'
very slowly or not at all.

There was some mention of accelerated metabolism and shorter lifespans 
because of the enhanced immune system and error handling machinery in
themselves as opposed to knock-on effects.

The primary determinants of metabolic rate would appear to be size and
activity level (e.g. mice v elephants). My gut feeling would be that the
slow cell turn over rate would mitigate any effects caused by
\'enhancements\'.

Hmm...
Andy, have you considered using the Virushi???

        I did not like how it discouraged new players.  So, I changed it to
an "injury" roll where the highest physical stat was permanently reduced by
however much the roll was missed by.  And you were cashiered.

Quite a feat, considering that the Aramis Museum is deep underground, with
no direct opening to the surface and a mean tunnel height of 5 meters.

I suppose the players could just say they took it out the same way the

Hmm.  Tempting, but perhaps too lacking in frontier activities, like
encountering
aliens and foreign powers, mysteries, exploratory trade, etc.

At the moment, I\'m leaning towards someone\'s suggestion of the Marches
around 100, but the Marches has been done how many times?

But what are we looking for in a good sector/milieu?
Some of mine:

 - Miltary conflict, at least in recent past.
 - Contact with aliens, perhaps in conjunction with above
 - Likelihood of risky adventure and trade
 - Set somewhere between Milieu 0 and MT (Milieu 1100)
 - Previously undeveloped, at least not extenisively (probably most important).

Some potential areas:

Reaver\'s Deep / Daibei
 - Aslan  (pre-380 Border Wars)
 - Solomani (Easter Concord until 486, Old Earth Union)
[Military conflict, Political Intrigue, Trading Potential, Aliens]


Antares
 - Julian Protectorate (after 175)
 - League of Antares (autonomous region)
 - Vargr Extents [Vargr Campaigns begin in 210]
[Military conflict, Political Intrigue, Trading Potential, Aliens]

Of the two, I lean towards Reaver\'s Deep/Daibei (but I don\'t know if these
sectors have been developed before.  IIRC, Reaver\'s Deep has been.

Assuming all of the colony live and work near each other,
German will be your dominant language obviously, due to the large
proportion.  I imagine that initially, it will be the language of work,
trade, and education even as the colony expands. Feudal Technocracy
will reinforce this.

These languages have a great deal of similarity and many of these
speakers are multi-lingual.  So it may be easier to preserve the
lower-population languages as a \'home\' language.  And as the
coolony creates other settlements, if one is dominated by
language speakers of one type or another, that language may
have a resurgence (although I still think German would be the
trade language).

But with 1000 years, you could have anything!  English isn\'t that old.
So, its certainly plausible for a single language to evolve.  In fact,
it may be likely with the third and fourth generations.

Of course, I can\'t speak to specifics about the linguistic distinctions
with most of the languages.  Despite my Scandanavian nicknam.

I would like to see it set in the period of the First Interstellar War 
(and the ones that follow).  Better yet just put out the core of the 
Traveller universe in the main books and then sell a variety of Campaign 
books each covering a different period/setting.

I thought it was a cool idea at first, but later it seemed like a waste 
of time to make up a character just to have it die before it was 
finished.  It is very realistic, maybe too realistic, but not very 
playable.

Norwegian is only a language that is about a hundred years old and
based on danish. Here norway we have little truble understanding swedish,
danish is acctually harder due to the strange use of certian sounds.
(We always say that Danes talk like they have a potato in their troath).

In a thousand years there would be no difference in the language 
spoken by the scandinavian decendents, but with such a large german
and austrian influence I would say that it would be the dominent language.
Scandinavians often learn german, and even without this a slow speaking
german could easly make himself understood in Norway for example (given some
signlanguage thrown in). 

There is one cultural barrier that exists today that is worth mentioning.
Norway was occupied by Germany during WWII and the Scandinavians were
the perfect example of the white race for the Nazi. This has made the
scandinavians (especially the norwegians) to become very aware of 
facist grupps. If this was dominantly present in the German population 
I could beleave that the norwegians would avoid contact with the germans
to a large extent, something that could lead to the preservation of
their culture.

One interesting idea would be to throw in a group from Iceland. Now they 
could perserve both their language and culture for one millenia.

I would say $15-$30 (US) for the lot.  I wouldn\'t pay more than the low
end myself.   People how already have them, may pay for a copy in
great condition, whereas others, like myself, are only really interested in
the content.

A minor point perhaps - but I would question the suitability of your

Perhaps "Please copy starship lists to Loren" would have been better.

On the other hand, I wouldn\'t have read your message twice if you had.

What would be a suitable format for putting the deckplans of a 5000T
exploratory trader on the web?

GIF seems somewhat unsuitable. The easiest would be a zipped CC Artworks
file, but that might be a bit obscure for most people. :-)

(If anyone wants to suggest PDF, then a suggestion as to how to create
 such a document without paying Adobe any money would be nice)

I was actually prompted to post this by Volker pleading

even though he meant something else :-)

Peter is confused when others refer to self in third person.  Peter
thinks Doug is good writer, if Doug wants Core during Arbelleatra\'s
Regency will Doug write it?

Peter would like to see a sector map and an entire sectors worth of
UPP"s for whatever sector is chosen to appear in the basic book.  One of
the truisms of the current RPG market is that settings sell, not
systems.  One of the advantages of the Traveller setting has always been
its _scope_.  Publishing an entire sector in the basic book may go part
of the way towards conveying that scope to new players.

They are on mine :) in the deckplan base directory. 
Mine is Nov 98 issue - labelled 981130_1821.

There are other deckplans on there too. But I have not been able to read 
all of them.

It was recently purchased from BITS (bits@bits.org.uk  www.bits.org.uk)
In the states I think it is available from Bryan Borich

Well, I\'ll have to take the other tack...ever get a complete newbie 90%
through character generation, have \'em miss one roll and tell them...

"Oh well, start over, that one died..." 

They say "Oh well, that\'s over, lets go play D&D some more. This Traveller is
a STUPID game."

KILLING characters before you even _start_ playing always seemed to me to be
the ultimate in user-unfriendliness. 

Sure it set it apart from other games...but that wasn\'t necessarily good. At
least Paranoia is up front about it and tells you right off that you\'re going
to be running Owen PlayerCharacter 7 before long...

	In character generation? Discourage new players? Whatever you 
mean?

	I refereed a pencil-and-paper MT campaign for two years and 
a half, with the premise of absolute combat realism and no referee 
intervention to save players. The result was that we lost a PC every 
two gaming sessions... my game rocketed in popularity in the local 
club, and the players developed caution and a "more roleplay, less 
combat" style. Never a single player was discouraged by that.

	About death in chargen (and you can imagine we used chargen *a 
lot*), we just maintained it there. It somewhat fit with the 
campaign. In order not to waste time for nothing, I simply instituted 
the rule that players should do their best to forget the failed PCs, 
so that I could use them as NPCs (forgetting about their death).

	All together, that meant I could almost forget about generating NPCs 
myself. Nice side-effect.

	Ahhh... those were good days. A single character actually survived 
for over a year real time (a scout: the marines died usually quick), 
and boy that was a memorable character. After it eventually died 
(in a Vargr corsair attack in the second part of the campaign), the 
player adopted the name of this character as real-life nickname 
(with it being something as strange as Zonk Shoshholl, you can 
imagine how he had became attached to him).

The separation of the Norse language (aka North germanic) began ~1000 
years ago but swedish, norwegian and danish have remained very similar. 
I can understand spoken norwegian (so can most swedes) with little 
problem but I rather speak english when I\'m in Denmark (because of that 
potato thing). They understand me but I dont\'t understand them. On the 
otherhand I find it much easier to read danish than norwegan. It is 
_very_ easy easy for a swede to learn norwegian and danish. Actually I 
have a friend who is half swedish/half norwegian who speaks all three 
fluently (he learned danish in 1-2 months). Given 1000 years of 
evolution I don\'t think the languages will reamain more separated than 
say, dialects are today.

About 30% of all school children in Sweden do at least 3 years of study 
in German (I did 6 years). Perhaps initially the mayor language would be 
english but given time german would become the language franca. Wonder 
if a scandinavian language would survive? A 1000 years is a lot of time.

Yes and the have very nice rolling R\'s (Icelandic is almost 100% 
preserved Ancient Norse and is separeted by 1000 years from the other 
scandinavian languages).

First of all, thank you very much to all of you that have offered up ideas. Speaking as 
one who hasn\'t had any sort of biology since 11 years ago (and I got a C- in it), I was 
unsure if such a lifeform with radiation resistance could be found.

Now, to answer some questions -

1) The planet in question is not a friendly place to us poor humans (or for most life, 
for that matter). The binary stars in the system are prone to eratic variability, and 
radioactive solar flares are relatively common. The structure of the planet is such 
that it does not have a very effective van allen belt - only the atmosphere provides 
real protection from radiation. In addition, the planet itself possesses more natural 
radioactive substances than earth - although not massively so. The majority of the 
danger is from space.

2) I never mentioned this - but the race in question is _sentient_. Not an animal. In 
fact, at milleu 0 they have almost reached TL 12 (having received the jump drive from 
the Ithklur - who got it from the Hivers, of course).

3) Lets assume for a moment that the Krahz/Chk (the race) has backup genetic material, 
cellular repair mechanisms, and the ability to hunt down and neutralize free radicals 
in their own bodies - it seems to me the some unscrupulous people might want to get 
their hands on some of their blood/antibodies...

4) So the race can resist radiation (which is what I wanted)...what price do they pay? 
Suggestions I\'ve heard are high metabolism and short life span (which work well with my 
vision)) - what unique health risks does such a race have? What would happen if their 
immune system broke down? How would that be better/worse than a human immune system 
disorder?

Again, thanks for all the insight...

Since they\'re a spacefaring race, the question will come up: what happens
to them when they\'re not in their cozy high-rad environment?

Remember, this planet is home to them - they\'re comfortable there.

Once they leave, there may be adjustments to make. Will human-comfy
planets be too cold for them, too dim? Will they suffer vitamin or enzyme
deficiencies due to lack of energy in their new environment (much like
humans need some sunlight)? Will they go through an adjustment phase
where their defense mechanisms are running strong, with little radiation
to fight - their bodies have to eliminate defense compunds that are usually
expended fighting radiation.

Then they readjust when they come home again...they leave, their bodies
poison them (temporarily), they come back, their environment poisons
them until they\'re back in balance.

Unless they\'re well-adapted enought to the random radioactive solar
flares that they\'re comfortable over a wide range of radiation levels.

Bob Dole would like to see the region surrounding Terra during the

The exact year doesn\'t matter, of course.  Still, it would be nice if it
was before the first contact between the TL12 Imperium and the TL16 (kind
of) Darrians....  Tell your players to bring a spare set of trousers... 
These people are dangerous.

This is a good point, of course.  However, the very familiarity is part of
the appeal.  You get to make the history with which you are familiar.  It\'s
also different enough, and dangerous enough to kill any number of smarties
that think they know it all.  And it\'s a damn fine time in its own right.

Yes, it has.  The Reaver idea was one of the things that made me think of
SM100.  Basically, it\'s Pocket Empires at a much lower level, where someone
with a handful of ships is an Emperor.  RD and/or Daibei is another option
for this.

I\'m fine about Antares, as I\'ve said before.  It\'s a bit more structured
though, with real interstellar states out there.  That has its merits - PCs
can be \'controlled\' more easily where there is some serious law
enforcement.

Frankly, I don\'t really care.  I\'m glad several people have responded
favourably to my suggestion though.

Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are so closely related that if the three
countries were united, they would be called dialects. I can read Norwegian
and Swedish almost as fast as I read Danish. Speech is slightly more
difficult, but really only a matter of practice. In the colony you\'re
describing the three languages will (IMO) melt together in a matter of
years.

However, I really think that the main setting should be more able to 
use the races and background that have marked the majority of 
Traveller development over the last 20 years.  I\'d suggest as the 
main setting a time period after the start of the 3I, perhaps during 
the height of the psionic suppressions, etc.  Location should enable 
the use of Traveller\'s most developed races, which seem to include 
Humaniti, Aslan, and Vargr, with Hivers and Droyne trailing not too 
far behind.

Another SAEP I\'d like to see explored would be either the Long Night 
or the Geonee Era, where the political climate is completely 
different than the 3I setting, and other types of scenarios could be 
explored.  Just a thought...

Do you have software that can import/export CGM files? Being a *vector*
format, I think it\'s the best bet. And a *lot* of packages can import
CGM. 

Bit-mapped formats all have problems when you try to scale them up or
down. Just as an example, I have a plotter that\'ll take B size paper.
It\'d be great for deckplans. But not for ones in bit-mapped formats. :-(

that pinetrees probably don\'t have any more expressing
genes than other plants (it this true?).  So the extra
damage must occur at non-expressing sites.  My guess is
that you can\'t always fix cleaved DNA."

	There is certainly no reason to expect that pine trees 
	require more \'expressing\' DNA than other plants, though
	I cannot be certain of this. On Terra, noncoding, highly 
	repetitive DNA can account for more than 90 % of some 
	genomes (a genome is the entire genetic complement of an
	organism). There are interesting theories about how such 
	DNA has accumulated (see for example \'The Selfish Gene\' 
	by Dawkins), but it is thought that large genomes are 
	associated with large cells and slow development.


Robert O\'Connor writes:

	Absolutely, and particularly reproductive tissue. This 
	gives me another thought: perhaps \'normal\' (for Terra)
	cell turn over would be observed if most cells lacked
	genes. Imagine a dispersed network of cells that bud
	off \'slave\' cells that contain enzymatic machinery, etc
	but no genes. These cells would be muscle, skin, bone, 
	etc, and might even continue to receive proteins from 
	the \'master\' cells nearby. Such cells would probably
	not last long (like red blood cells) but the \'master\'
	cell would not really replicate and so its genome would
	be protected somewhat. Senescence (aging) of these 
	\'master\' cells might be a problem, but then life is 
	tough all over.

"The primary determinants of metabolic rate would appear to 
be size and activity level (e.g. mice v elephants)."

	Don\'t forget about the vast majority of Terran 
	organisms that are not \'warm-blooded\'.

"My gut feeling would be that the slow cell turn over rate would 
mitigate any effects caused by \'enhancements\'."

	Probably true, and there are other advantages to having a 
	low metabolic rate (alligators have been around for a 
	while).

It\'s more likely that a citizen with a permit is (almost) always squeaky

OB Trav: a reason to keep your imperial weapons permits valid is to show good

an inspection...

I\'m coming into this thread rather late, but what the heck, I\'ll toss in a
flame: Clay\'s right. It\'s not only inaccurate to refer to a GM as "God," it\'s
not likely to foster a pleasurable roleplaying experience if you have a GM who
thinks this is his role.

The GM is more like a manager in a company. Number one, he\'s a facilitator. He
sets the environment and pace for the players to excel in their positions.
In a
company, employees should be productive. In an RPG, they should be having fun.

The GM is the final authority, like the corporate manager, but he has to
remember that roleplaying (like business) is a collaborate effort. In an RPG
it\'s collaborative storytelling. The GM plays the primary role in developing
the story, but it\'s the players who get the glory of moving the story, just as
it\'s the employees in the company who perform the actual work in a company
project.

Sometimes, the GM must levy decisions that aren\'t popular, but they\'re for the
good of the company. In an RPG, this can mean, for example, character death.
But like being disciplined or penalized in a corporate environment, the player
in an RPG should understand why he has been penalized and shouldn\'t come away
from the experience with any lasting negative feeling. And hopefully he should
be able to come back and continue to perform well having learned from his
experience.

I create the universe, I setup the laws of nature, I give my people free
will unless overruled by me, my players worship me and give me gifts to
keep me in a happy ie I\'m a God.

(I also think that religious people in general are WAY too sensitive about
poking fun on their delusions)

I have Acrobat Exchange and PDFWriter, so I can make PDF files.

I agree. However, we referees are more like the Apollo god in one of the old
Star Trek episodes. If nobody worships us, we fade away. Meaning: without

The long-term problems posed by radiation are primarily genetic material
breakdown. Everything else can be handled by basic physiological processes. 

Our (Terra circa 1990 and even before) handles the problem of radiation
degradation of processes in computers with a tell me three times system. Three
independent systems process data and give independent answers. If any two
agree, then that answer is used. Now imagine a DNA -analogue for cellular
systems that has three independent nuclei. Upon cell division, two  of the
three have to match for reproduction to occur (whether cell reproduction or
being reproduction).

There will be rare situations where two nuclei are identically damaged by
radiation. Other than that, mutations would be caused by factors other than
radiation.

Such beings would have larger cells (three nuclei) and a higher metabolic
overhead (although not necessarily a high metabolic rate). They would probably
be larger for the same effect in Terran physiology.

I am playing around with deckplans and starship graphics. Currently, I am
looking at a turret on a starship, and I am wondering about it\'s design. Do
you envision a starship\'s turrets to be of the "ball turret" design, with
360 x 180 degree coverage (as on the old WWII B-17 belly gun? Or would they
be of a more limited-traverse turrets similar to the kind you see in all
kinds of starship illustrations (similar to modern-day naval guns)?

I tried putting a ball turret on top of a Type-S, but it looked kind of odd
and unstreamlined (since the axis of the ball needs to be outside of the
plane of the outer hull to account for a gun barrel).

I guess what I am asking for is an opinion of aesthetics v. functionality.
Of course, it could be that it\'s a truly foolish question (given the laser
arrays as depicted in FF&S, AFAIK ships weapons would look nothing at all
as they are portrayed in most popular illustrations).

Question for our Scandanavian TMLers (and other interested parties):


Speaking as an interested party...

What languages were spoken would depend on who was in power.  The people in
power direct the goverment, control business/wealth, and decide on what arts
flourish.

When the colonization effort was organized in the 21st, the Germans would
have the bulk of the space experience.  The Scandanavian groups probably
offered funding and selected expertise.  This might make them powerful in
colonial affairs, disproportionate with their small numbers.

Once the colony is set up, who is in power to begin with?

If everyone is equal, maybe English continues to be the linga franca,
gradually melding into the numerous German with Scandi words.  You could get
the English language structure, with most words having a German origin and a
strong Scandanavian presence.

If certain technologies are far more important to the colony\'s\' survival,
the language of these technicians will have special protection.  If it one
or more of the Scandanavian groups, it could be that the Scandanavian
languages merge, picking up the majority German syntax.  There could appear
a two tier language, the upper class melded Scandanavian, the lower class
German.

If it were the other way around (Germans in charge of critical tech) the
Scandanavian languages would probably be swamped, appearing in a thousand
years only as occasional words or phrases.

Has anyone mapped anything below (rimward) of these? If so, I don\'t want
to duplicate work already done.

Also, if anyone has mapped Aldebaran, I\'d appreciate knowing.

Certainly laser arrays should look more like big flat sheets (telescopes at
low TL) than long skinny barells. TNE\'s portrayal (like a plate on an 
articulared arm) might be a bit extreme. I could imagine a big plate recessed
into a spherical ball-type turret. It might not be able to shoot straight
forward if the ball turret was inset into the hull...Or maybe a more angular
turret that partially retracts for atmosphere flight?

My take on it (a gif of which I\'ll post on my web site as soon as I get
my home system back together from an unexpected reformat and re-install
of everything) is along the lines of what Bruce is saying here...the
turret is a dome that clamshells open revealing the external laser
assembly, which looks a bit like the old Multiple Mirror Telescope
assembly...some hexagonal cells all put together on some sort of
pivoting frame. I took my cue somewhat from the TNE version of lasers. 

There\'s no need to streamline the laser assembly, it only fires in
vaccuum.

Far Trader presents J-2 as the "standard", right?  So ships
of higher jump are getting into the high jump market which
is dominated by liners?  So I was thinking this type of ship would
indeed be designed for small liner companies, maybe ones with only
a few ships (though obviously PC may not be using it that way :-).
Such a ship would seem to be most commonly used by a shiping company
or as a specialize ship (in case you need something sent faster).
While the PCs may indeed use it at a "tramp", the name on the
design presumably indicates the common usage.

Calling it a "trader" or "mechant" would solve the problem.

Well, here in Oregon you don\'t have to be "squeaky clean" to get a
permit. You have to take a course and pass about the same background
check it takes to *buy* a gun these days.

A person I sort of know used to run around with a group in California
that did wargaming at all scales from 1:5000(?) naval miniatures up to
1:1 scale. Seem a lot of them werte collectors. For the 1:1 stuff
they\'d drive their old gear out into the Mojave and play "Afrika Corps"
with real tanks and APCs....

Can you picture encountering their little "convoy" on the road and
running plate to find out they\'ve got *live* weapons?

Aww. But that\'d be the *smart* thing to do. How many players ever have
their characters act intelligently? :-)

No real reason to. Sure, the mechanisms will be interesting. But they
won\'t likely be something you can "graft onto" another species. 

On the other hand, assuming that their atmosphere and nutritional needs
are fairly normal (ignoring the possibly higher levels of food), they
might be sought after (willingly or as slaves) to work in high rad
environments. 

For slaves, mining radioactives, or handling nuclear waste. As
employees, they\'d be good for reactor maintenance, handling and
processing fissionables, etc.

After all, if you can cut down on the *interior* shielding required in
a plant, you can save a lot of money. Ditto if you\'ve got workers that
don\'t have to be given extended leaves to keep their average dose
within limits. 

Note that for many of these jobs, they\'ll still need standard
*chemical* protective gear. A lot of nasty chemicals are involved in
processing both fissionables and nuclear waste. 

If you go the legal route, I *do* want to watch as you submit the
documentation to the Health & Safety Bureau regarding the safe exposure
levels for the species! Especially the part where you note that they
have what is in effect a minimum daily *requirement* for radiation, to
keep their defenses properly stimulated.

Well, as noted above (and others have suggested) they might be
suspectible to various auto-immune disorders. They also may *need*
frequent radiation exposure to keep certain of their "defense"
mechanisms both working, and to from getting "carried away". That is,
too long without radiation and their defensive response might not
respond well to new exposure (rather like the way people kept isolated
from "normal" bacteria for long periods have a tendency to get sick
from darn near *everything* for a while once normal exposure is
restored). The "carried away" is based on a theory about some auto
immune disorders. If the immune system doesn\'t have enough to do, it so
to speak starts "looking harder" for things that are out of spec. And
the result is attacks on healthy tissue. 

BTW, given your comments about them being almost TL 12, I\'ll bet you a
cookie that either they kept using fission reactors on their ships long
after they had fusion, or they are using one of the "dirty" fusion
reactions. In either case, the reason would be so that they\'d have a
steady radiation source for the crew to expose themselves to
periodicly.

(frequent stellar flares, nearby neutron star accretion disk, whatever)
the underground life might have some "plants" that make *use* of the
hi-rad levels by "circulating" compounds that are both more likely to
"stop" radiation, and that having stopped it, tend to break into
compounds that energy can be derived from. 

Photosynthesis is more efficient, but given the rate at which I\'d
expect chloroplasts to get ruined by radiation, a backup/supplement
would be good. 

So instead of "leaves", there\'d be some sort of transparent tubes or
sheets, with a colored sludge moving thru them slowly. The tubes or
sheets would be made of something sturdy and not terribly susceptible
to radiation damage. Perhaps silica. A number of terran organisms
create silica structures. Diatoms, glass sponges, grass (the silica is
why the edges are so sharp!). 

The sludge would most be the waxy (waxes have a high capture cross
section for neutrons and protons), and contain lots of chlorplasts (the
bodies inside plant cells that actually carry out photosynthesis) as
well as some sort of cells/subcells that check for damage to the silica
shell, and patch/extend it as needed.

Once back inside the underground body, the sludge would be filtered (a
lot like blood passing through the liver in animals). Damaged
chloroplasts would be filtered out and broken down for recycling. The
free radicals would be harvested and used to create sugars or whatever
energy storage chemical the plant uses. The sugars created by the
chloroplasts would also be filtered out, along with the oxygen they
produced. CO2 would be added to replace that used in photosynthesis. 
And general chemical "grunge" from light or radiation induced reactions
would be filtered as waste or recycled into raw materials.

So in essence, you\'d have a "plant" with at least a partial circulatory
system. Probably several. One for the photosynthesis sludge, another
for circulating "sap" to the rest of the plant. 

I think the circulating "sludge" would be more practical than any sort
of normal leaves, simply because the radiation damage to chloroplasts
and other structures would require them to be rebuilt at a rate that
would likely cost more energy than the circulation trick.

I can even suggest a way it might have evolved. You start with the
single cells living in a hot spring type environment where the water
bubbles up to the surface and sinks back in other places.

At first, the springs provide circulation. And cells would be carried
to the surface where food is easier to make, and sink to the bottom
were repairs are easier to make. 

Eventually, some cells learned to "deliberately" rise and sink as they
needed food or time to eat and repair. Then multicellular colonies
(sort of like slime molds?) evolved that had cells transiting between
the surface and the bottom. Finally, the body of the "slime" gets large
enough that it is circulating the body rather than circulating cells
thru water. 

At this stage, the spring isn\'t needed, just a deep hole with water.
And evolving a "cover" to prevent, or at least regulate, water loss is
likely. Bingo, you\'ve got the distant ancestors of the plant. And at
this stage, it hasn\'t even had to develop differentiated cell types
yet!

Direct radiation damage is pretty obvious.  The strand is
cut in two.  The base pair isn\'t a base pair anymore.  Two
strands have been crosslinked and can no longer be seperated...

That works fine for visible light lasers but what do you do with X-ray lasers?  And

Jeff likes the idea of the Claw Expansion period, but would
really get hot for lots of source material that _doesn\'t_ focus
on the Imperium at all.  Zhodani Core Expeditions, Solomani Rim
Expeditions, and the Aslan Diaspora are potentially
orgasm-inducing. :)

Really? Does the state police do their own check, or do they use the FBI? In

I should have clarified...they probably can\'t be fired in atmosphere
when the ship is _moving_ at any great speed because the assembly is not
streamlined...wouldn\'t want to fire the thing and have the aiming
assembly warped so it hit your own ship...

Tonight or tomorrow morning, I\'ll post a link to a picture of the thing,
if I have a rendering of it, it\'ll make it clearer.

My take on this is that the actual gender ratio is unimportant,
and that psychological assimilation is what is being referred to
here - especially as I recall (perhaps from the DGP module) a
comment to the effect that the first to properly assimilate were
Japanese.  If you think about the common knowledge of Japanese
culture, and what we know of Aslan culture, the Japanese start
out halfway there.

More to the point, I would imagine that the Zodian Clans (the
Aslan-assimilated Humans) might have two kinds of gender -
biological (i.e., which set of reproductive organs do you have?)
and social (i.e., what kind of job do you do?).  In all matters
not dealing _directly_ with reproduction, social gender would
normally be used - and I don\'t find it unlikely that they might
end up with a _social_ gender ratio of 3:1.

The Rite of Passage, IIRC, is not implied as being potentially
fatal - or at least not so that a significant portion can be
expected to die, any more than this can be expected of the Vulcan
Kahs-wan.  Certainly, it will be a strong test of those skills
and qualities most admired in an Aslan of the appropriate gender
(there are both male and female rites), but equally certainly it
would be counterproductive for a young, dynamic, expanding race
to deliberately impose a high attrition rate on its young -
unless the birthrate is so high that expansion can\'t keep up with
it (which is not implied to be the case).

The current translation of "ihatei" is "second son".  What\'s not
specified is whether we\'re talking second biological offspring,
or merely someone who is not in line to be the heir.  Let us
suppose that it is possible to say "A and B both passed the Rite,
but B did a better job of it." In that case, perhaps B, the
second son in birth order, might be named the heir, and the
disinherited A would now have some incentive to improve himself
and then go out and win lands for himself, and form his own clan.
Hence, a motivated ihatei (second son, in the sense that he will
not inherit).  Additionally, the new lands that A carves out for
himself represent more lands ultimately controlled by the Aslan
race - expansion and survival.

(It\'s a fascinating subject - maybe someday I\'ll work up a
detailed discussion of this for "publication".)

One subtle issue is that the last mirror (the one that does the beam 
directing) has to be the big one (ie the mirror whose diameter defines
the laser\'s range.)

Presumably at TL-13, there are x-ray mirrors that work like visible-light
mirrors do today (I assume their absence is one factor that limits x-ray
lasers to TL-13, for that matter.)
>And then you get into the hokeyness of gravitic focusing, etc.
The grav focus mechanism probably I would picture as something mounted
in a central hole in the primary launch aperture of the laser - or even
(since gravity waves can mostly pass through matter) the grav modules 
that make the focussing pulse are located behind the main launch aperture/
mirror.

Example, English remaining a basically a Germanic language in the face of

compare the repalcement of Gaulish with Latin in what is now France, over a
similar period of time with a similar ratio of elite speakers to native

The best character deaths are in three ways.
Pre-arranged (as you did, Dom), heroic selfless giving of a life to save 
others, and the quick fatal response to an incredibly stupid act...

I like this idea better.  I am running a year 50 campaign in the 
Gushemege Sector.  There is still a lot of information that could be 
produced for this setting.  

I doubt very seriously I would scrub a campaign for which I have 
invested a couple of hundred dollars (I have practically all the books 
for this setting) unless it would add to what I already have ... not 
make it history.

My group was gung-ho on the first TNE (and Traveller) adventure I ever ran,
many moons ago.  Party of 5 Ex-Dawn League Marines.  They got ambushed by a
machine gun nest (TL5 7mm MMG).  Poor lil Javier "Loser" Jackowski (STR 9, AGL
8, CON 9) took a slug in the head (outstanding success doubled 20 damage to
40, which is a serious wound).  He was also knocked down and stunned.  (Though
automatically unconcious, renders that moot).  To top it off, I was using the
optional Instant Kill-Quick kill, but out of generosity to the player, decided
it was the number of dice instead of points (as i\'d ruled earlier when they
asked).  Unfortunately, I rolled a 3, I remember (DV of 7mm MMG-5 ball is 4).
RIP "Loser" Jackowski (1172-1201).  His buddy, Ivan "Bad Ass" Taboko (STR A,
AGL 7, CON B) took 2 to the chest and 1 to the arm (scratch, scratch, slight
IIRC).   He was knocked down, as well,  stunned, and would have had -1 to
initiative if he didn\'t fail the 2nd roll on Quick Kill.  RIP "Bad Ass"
(1168-1201).  Another character (Arthur Edmund "Eddie" Jones; 1172-1201) ate
it the next round (they threw a grenade in, but it bounced out.  The last 2
decided they\'d had enough, as they had no cover and decided they weren\'t going
to get shot in the back, so they just charged the nest and got one (Dick
Kabuki... this guy can\'t think up names, so he just took one out of the TNE
book IIRC) gunned down (a bunch of chest and head hits IIRC... ironically, the
same thing happened in AD&D when his dwarven warrior charged a bunch of orc
archers.  That still makes us laugh).  The last guy gets in there ok, and pops
the machine gunner (or the A-gunner, as it turns out), to note there\'s another
guy in there (and the gunner they\'d apparently killed before) w/ a 7mm assault
rifle trained on him.  Opportunity fire.  Jorge "Big Boy" Washington bit it.

The second adventure, 3 of the 5 new characters (in the "civilian" campaign)
get killed by TL5 gang members w/ 5mm revolvers (DV -1!) and an SMG (DV 2).
That\'s when I decided Install Kill-Quick Kill had to go, so i went to d10
damage and double damage quick kill.  (Though i later adopted T2k (?) quick
kill, moving damage level up to serious).  

Then I discovered the TML, where I hear TNE combat isn\'t fatal enough.  LOL.
My players were ok w/ the first one, but the second incident made them voice
going back to Star Wars, before I assured them they had just been unlucky.

For my upcoming campaigns, I\'ve been contemplating going to double damage for
short range (as I found someone\'s nice summary on the TNE directory of the
missouri archive).  I\'m not sure, though... my games have had alot of
fatalities, as is.  More than their share, it seems...

I know what you mean!  The campaigns evolved, naturally, with them getting a
better grasp of small unit tactics (none are Marines, like me, though I used
alot of my books & stuff from the School of Infantry in making up RC Tactical
Circulars).  Still, by the time, they (the military characters) were in combat
armor and battle dress, they were running into Crunch Guns, High-Energy
weapons and armored fighting vehicles and a Vampire Hiver Bruiser (what they
dubbed "The Roper").  Ah, those were the days.  : )

Wow.  Now *that\'s* what I was looking for when i asked the question.  Thanks

Ok.  I\'ve taken enough geology to expect that.  But hundreds of thousands?

I\'ve always considered myself a god (small "g") in "my world". Then

were it it...

I haven\'t posted in many, many months now (been very busy with other
projects), and specifically stayed out of this particular thread topic
because it was potentially prone to violent flaming.  But...



Anders, are you referring to someone with religious beliefs as being
"delusional" with regards to *those* beliefs?  If so, your remark is
prejudicial and in *very* bad taste.  Those types of remarks are better
left off of the list.



That being said, the term "god" (note the lowercase use to describe a
"godlike" being, and not "God" per se) is still a lot closer to fitting the
job and/or purpose of a Game Master than a CEO, etc., due to the additional
things a "god" has power over (for instance, a CEO cannot change legal law,
under which the company must abide by).

However, there are a lot of things that a "god" (or "God") can do that no
Game Master could ever hope to imagine.  If the term "god" translates into
a being with *unlimited* power (as I have been led to believe by following
this thread), some examples might include:

1) Dictating (with 100% control) the actions of a Player Character.  Sure,
   a referee can boot the player out and turn the PC into an NPC, but that
   does not change the fact that a GM *cannot* dictate everything a *PC*
   does, since by definition, the character is no longer a PC.
2) Adding to example #1, it may be possible that such a GM decides to kick
   *all* of his/her players out of the game in order to maintain that true
   100.00% control over every being in the game universe.  While there is
   nothing that can be done to stop the GM from doing this, the "delusions
   of grandeur" thing suddenly rears its ugly head.  This is an RPG,
   remember, and by definition needs at least one player and one GM.
3) Make effortless decisions and/or changes that effect the past history of
   the game universe.  While there is a difference between Real World time
   and the game universe clock, a slight change in the past will have
   countless unforseen consequences that will take a mortal GM months or
   even years to sort out.  Remember, the main point of an RPG is to spend
   your time actually playing it, not engineering it.
4) Combining examples #1 & #3, no GM can predict the future of a campaign
   down to the position of the last atom without resorting to example #2.
   In other words, no mortal GM could ever hope to possess the ability to
   quickly and easily traverse temporal reality.  A true "god" does not
   exist inside time, and a mortal claiming to represent one simply does
   not have enough time during their lifetime to pull this off.
5) Changing physical laws and be prepared for the consequences.  If you
   decide that zero centigrade is no longer the freezing point of water, or
   something as simple as 1+1=3, you have created a domino affect effecting
   countless billions of other variables in the universe.  No mortal human
   being (in the role of a GM) could possibly fathom all of the changes
   that might go along with the initial change.
6) Know *everything*.  While you are free to apply example #5 to a
   situation where, say, a player in the game happens to know more about
   chemical rockets than you do (let\'s say you are forced to change the
   efficiency at which the chemical reaction takes place to provide a power
   increase 100x greater in order to remain 100.00% in control of your game
   universe), you have failed to inform your PCs and NPCs to take this into
   account.  PCs and NPCs (unless just recently born) have been exposed to
   such changes all their lives.  It therefore should not come as a shock
   to the player that things are not as they assumed they would be.  You
   have created confusion where there should be none.

The above examples help to show that no mortal human being in the role of
Game Master could ever hope to be compared to a "god".  If any of the above
examples happen to crop up in a particular campaign, it is likely that the
person playing the GM is suffering from "delusions of grandeur".  Let\'s
just say that the definition comes pretty close and leave it at that.

That is _exactly_ the kind of infinite regress to which I referred.  I
am playing Traveller.  My Traveller character plays Traveller.  My
Traveller character\'s Traveller character plays Traveller.... (et cetera
ad infinitum).

I would suppose, then, that the Traveller milieu played by Travller
characters would find analogies in current (late 20th century Earth)
RPGs.  Using Milieu 1110 as an example baseline, we might find the
following analogies:

CT:  "Mercenaries, Spies, and Private Eyes", "CORPS", or other "modern"
games

MT:  "Twilight: 2000" or White Wolf\'s "World of Darkness" RPGs

TNE: "Twilight: 2000" or "The Morrow Project"

T4:  "Boot Hill" or other "historical" RPGs

Produced by GsbAG in orbit around Vincennes, the first of the Susquehanna class
Frigates was launched on 345-1119 and formally commissioned INS Susquehanna on
167-1120 after a flawless shakedown cruise.

The design request called for a ship that could penetrate deeply into an
enemy’s rear area and raid civilian merchant shipping of up to several kilotons
displacement, but whose true prey would be the small merchant, generally
operating sub-600dton ships.  The purpose of this would be to erode the
public’s perception that they were in a safe area and to disrupt the flow of
shipping by drawing resources from other areas and forcing the small ships to
convoy for their own protection.

While this might seem like a waste of Imperial resources, picking on the small
merchants, the ability to spread fear and uncertainty among the civilian
populace and divert naval resources from other fronts and duties to protect
small merchants, who by nature are individualists and prefer to go their own
way, would actually be worth much more than the initial costs for the
Susquehannas would imply.

A secondary purpose, and one not mentioned outside of closed rooms, is that of
intelligence gathering and the covert insertion of direct action forces.  Able
to berth 8 Marines in individual large staterooms, or 16 with double occupancy,
the Susquehanna has a unique ability with her Jump-5 capability of appearing
and launching a lightning raid using her two gunned gigs for transport and
support.

Originally intended for operations against the Zhodani, Sword Worlds, or other
small human polities along the periphery of the Domain of Deneb, the
Susquehannas have proven quite effective against the Vargr along the Coreward
frontier.  Captain Dmitri Ridiima has gained a reputation with INS Olympia of
“out Vargring the Vargr” at their own game of hit and run.  Racking up an
impressive score of twenty three kills or captures, over 10,000dtons of
shipping, he has begun to gain a following among the younger Vargr of Olympia’s
patrol zone as they see Ridiima as a charismatic crusader who has never known
defeat.  Of course his family produces a Top-10 syndicated series dramatizing
his exploits might also factor into his extraordinary charisma among the Vargr.

Space craft are one of my favorite aspects of Traveller, and IMHO there has
yet to be a really good book of starships. Most of the previous books, like
IG\'s Starships and GDW\'s FSotSI, were full of poorly-designed military
craft. Typical referees could design better ships themselves, and had to,
because the ships in these books were not appropriate for most campaigns.

What I want are highly-optimised designs with complete background
information for ships players would encounter often in a campaign. I would
rather the book contain 3 *good* designs than 10 average designs.

By "highly-optimised" I mean that the designs take advantage of the
complete design rules and be extremely difficult to improve. Gearheads
should be able to use these designs as examples of the "right" way to
design GURPS Traveller starships.

By "complete background information" I mean that it includes information a
referee needs to run the ship in a campaign. At minimum, this would include
an illustration, full description of crew and carried vehicles, and
complete operations cost. I should know how much it costs to build, staff,
and operate the vessel.

The last request I have is to at least make the attempt to provide some
scientific rationale to the designs. I know this is a science *fiction*
game, but providing designs somewhat more plausible than WWII battleships
in space would be desirable. My pet peeves are decks parallel to the thrust
axis and hatches on the floor directly in front of doors.

Well, with that preamble out of the way; my top 10 list:

10. An asteroid ship. Probably not a great design, but these things are
canon and provide a very atmospheric setting.

9. Some kind of retro TL 9/10 ship. Traveller has had spacefaring
civilizations for thousands of years and some of those old designs must
still be in use. I envision an ancient TL 9 design retrofitted with TL 10
gravitics and power plants.

8. A large passenger liner with things like restaraunts, clubs, shopping,
and staterooms large enough for a family to stay in comfortably for weeks.
Most of the "passenger" designs in Traveller are reminiscent of prisons.

7. A battle tender. These are supposed to be the mainstay of the Imperial
fleet, yet the only good designs were in the game Battle Rider.

6. A battle rider. This thing should have multiple parallel spinal mounts,
high acceleration, and absurd amounts of armor. Naval doctrine says riders
can outfight battleships; so prove it.

5. A patrol cruiser. This should be a multi-purpose vessel with lots of
player-friendly features.

4. A large bulk hauler. Presumably one of the most common ships in space,
but you\'d never know this from the few designs that have been published. We
need to know the operational costs for one of these things in order to
determine fair shipping rates, and what the free traders are competing
with. Actually, I think TNE had a good design for one.

3. A shuttle or lander. Another common type of ship which players
encounter. The design should be simple, but we need deck plans.

2. An effective system defense boat. Most of the SDB designs I have seen
are so poorly armored that civilian weapons can damage them. It should also
be carryable by a battle tender.

1. A highport. This is an important setting in Traveller which players
encounter constantly and has, to my knowledge, never had a good design
published. I saw an "authorized" design once which was barely large enough
to hold the crew and cargo of a subsidized trader. These things are
supposed to be able to drydock battle tenders!

Just you, Clif.

I enjoy the company of women who can take care of themselves.  However,
the smell of burnt powder often accompanies situations that have gone to
Fort Polk in a handbasket.  I hardly find such a situation...inspiring,
in the romantic sense.

Word of advice:  Good looking is okay, but you should always prefer your
women with little or no firearm skill.  Seen one to many men saved by the
fact that women didn\'t know how to get the safety off.

D6 * UWP size _what_? Days -- certainly. Hours -- probably. 

What it really takes is a number of orbits. Three or four complete orbits
are enough to establish the planet\'s baseline gravitation (G*M) with
accuracy. Then you can go looking for more subtle effects. The lower the
orbit and the more passes you make, the finer the resolution. But for just
the J1 term (I think that\'s what it is -- I still don\'t have my geodesy
notes to consult) it wouldn\'t take more than a dozen passes or so -- that\'s
one of the first after the baseline G*M term. Say, 18-24 hours for a
typical low orbit around the Earth.

I would not say "comfortable" but adapted. IIRC, when i received some lessons of Ecology two years ago, i was told that there was an
island where an endemic bird species had been wiped off (can\'t remembar what eliminated them from the island) and then they found that
other bird species there were more fertile (in fact, that almost proved that they were not growing as much as they could, because some
external factor i.e. the devastated bird species, was making some selective pressure over them, direct or not).

I guess living in an highly irradiated world is no joke, no matter how does that species manage to live there. Sure they can manage to
live there, but if they were given the chance to live in less hard conditions, they would "improve" some of their species features :
better fertility, longer life, larger populations...--

I don\'t miss it because I still have and play the Classic Traveller rules.
I never moved past them to newer rules.

Actually, this is one of the things about Traveller character generation
that I love.  Most of my players have liked it too.  The whole idea took on
a form of roleplay in itself.

I disagree.  This is an integral part of the character generation process.
If you roll a character with an inital STR: of 2, stick him in the Belters
so that he can get killed off.  If unlucky enough to survive a few terms,
start trying for +1 Str on the Personal Development Table.  It\'s always a
riot.  I think that players love rolling up characters as much as playing.

<snip design>

I\'m not good on reading MT design sheets, so please make allowances if I
missunderstand something.

There don\'t appear to be any fuel scoops or a purification plant.

For a deep penetration raider to be able to use jump-5, it needs at
least enough fuel for jump-5 followed by jump-1 *without* refuelling
(just in case its destination isn\'t safe.)

The cargo space seems too low at 1%.

Without supplies, missile bays aren\'t ideal weapons and your independent
laser turrets are going to take some time chewing up 600std merchants
that aren\'t worth a missile salvo.
On that subject, if you have 10 turrets firing independently and one
bay, don\'t you need more than 3 gunners?

Tech 16? In whose Y1119 navy?

If you are just going after merchants, consider a carrier - even the
standard Imperial Heavy Fighter can make a mess of 600std merchants
and the risk to your carrier is quite low.

Fighters also allow you to be in several places at the same time,
so you can hit several merchants in the system and leave before
anyone can react. However a bunch of fighters is expensive.

Its an interesting design with an achievable mission.

<Free Trader rant>

The real problem with designs like this is that when we
use them on the Vargr, they just give the Vargr ideas.

When the Vargr version turns up, its not going to attack the Navy
or GasBag it going to attack ME! And how much compensation do you
think I\'m going to get from GasBag?

CC is Computer Concepts, their Artworks package was released for the
PC as Corel Xara.

I\'m going to try the ghostscript/PDF option. I really need something
better than floppy disks to shift stuff between computers - even zipped
the EPS files take 3 full disks.

Hopefully I\'ll put this on the web on Saturday. I only make this
claim because setting unrealistic deadlines is the only known
solution to my not doing anything :-)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
One thing about "highly optimized" - it assumes that your design sequence
covers everything about starships in the game universe. If anything is
ignored or abstracted out, then going for 100% efficient design can leave
you with a ship that\'s efficient, but not very realistic.

For example, ships made under CT High Guard don\'t need to have any
cargo space. You can have a multi-kiloton cruiser operate for a year
or more away from base with no space on board for cargo stores.

Another thing about "highly optimized", is that you have to ask, "optimized
for what?". A patrol cruiser has to be optimized for long time on station,
high-G interception, escort combat duties, space rescue operations,
priority transport capabilities and customs enforcement. While this
example is the most extreme, every ship has some multi-role design
requirements that will make it a little less of one thing to be more capable
at another.

100% optimization is fine when you\'re designing ships for starship combat
scrimmages (like we\'re doing over on CT-Starships list), but they don\'t
tend to make ships that are very interesting for the "real world" of a
Traveller universe.

On the other hand, it is better to acknowledge ones slips and
ask forgiveness than to bullishly ignore the clues...

It seems, from snippets I see, that some writers are taking
advantage of openings to snipe at Clif. He took his lumps, and
has been given an opportunity to return to this community. 
If he is going to misbehave and get himself exiled again, let
him do it on his own merits, without being goaded.

Yours maybe...then again, I prefer GURPS or FUDGE style directed chargen MUCH
beter than random chargen. The players end up with characters they like and

Actually, its a ploy to get a building into a place that it is not permitted.
You play dumb, build the building, then when the inspector comes you grease some
palms.

Same thing could be applied to nearly any illegal operation.

It\'s at the bottom of the page. As you can see it\'s pretty TNE-ish. My
take is that there is a small, clamshell  (or even flat) opening where
the \'turret\' is on the ship. When in firing position, the doors open and
the laser firing assembly is raised out of the opening, aimed and fired.

On ships with tight space concerns, such as small traders and the like,
the turret will be a dome on the hull...the disadvantage is that the
laser assembly is then in a very cramped compartment, requiring either
EVA\'s on the hull or a shirtsleeve environment to work in. In naval
vessels, I suspect the entire assembly would be retractable into the
hull for maintenance, and repair purposes.

I\'ve never seen GURPS char rollup.  All I know is what I\'ve read on the list.

What I\'ve done for 20 years now, in my FTF games, if a player blows a survival 
roll, the got to roll on a little table I prepared that automatically mustered 
them out and put them in play.  I don\'t have a copy of it in front of me, but 
some of the things on it included a Dishonorable Discharge (lose 3 mustering 
out rolls), Lose a limb (roll a die, divide by 2, round *UP*, and take that 
off your choice of STR, DEX, or END), and so forth.  There were die mods for 
the various careers so that Others\' couldn\'t get a Dishonorable Discharge but 
*could* get \'Spend 1D6 years in an Imperial Prison, -2 SOC\'.

Fun table.  And considering one group I GMed for about 2 years had over a 
*third* of them blow a survival roll, the results were interesting...

	Sounds like a fun table, I like it.   I think maybe allowing the player to
dump any character who fails survival roll might be a good optional rule as
well.  But, I think I am converted to the viewpoint that it should be
automatic death, that would discourage the more fragile or newbie players.

You hear a noise.
You blast off a magazine (each) of ammo at the target.
It turns out to be a snake/critter.
You have just used a chunk of your basic load.
If I am nearby, I now *know* that you are, and which direction you are
in.

The answer is: The second. Troops with the second philosophy are likely
to be well trained and well disciplined, and will most likely detect and
engage less disciplined, poorer quality troops before they are located.
They are also less likely to run out of ammo when they need it.

Assuming you mean an M-60 category for machinegun, and an Uzi for SMG,
these should be reversed. Inside, you\'re more likely to be able to get
an Uzi / MP-5K / Skorpion on target while the guy with the heavy tool is
still thinking about it.

Shotguns, especially modern combat shotguns, are above rifles/assualt
rifles for real close-in work. Probably just worse than an SMG.

>Grenade

Nah. Outside, you can\'t throw a grenade beyond it\'s blast radius. The
are strictly for use when you can ensure that you aren\'t going to kill
yourself - preferably, when the other guy is in a bunker/trench/building
- - or if he isn\'t and you are.

>Machinegun
>Rifle
>SMG
>Shotgun
>Pistol

Light antiarmour weapons shout feature on this list somewhere - they are
just the job for removing nasty MG emplacements at range. E.g. British
Army use of MILAN missiles during Op. Corporate.

ObTraveller: I\'m going to be most scared by the git with the UV Laser
Rifle and the mother of all electronic sights. No signature, just my
troops going down. I guess that\'d need some form of UV vision capability
to combat.

The M2, when it came out, was the best IFV on the market. Sure, there
are better, newer things today (I\'m a BMP-3 fan myself). As for Patriot
- - it was out hitting Scuds, even though it wasn\'t (at the time) designed
as an anti-missile system.

Do you actually know anything about how military procurement works?

ObTraveller: I guess that, since the individual armed forces are so big,
the 3I procurement would have been done by the individual forces rather
than by a joint-forces procurement body like we have at the moment.

Belting, and I found that the "Beltstrike" rules left me wondering why any
Sophont not fit for insitutionalization would even bother.  =)  So, with the
help of someone one evening on the #TRAVELLER IRC Undernet channel
(Shadowcat - e-mail me with your name so I can give you credit!), I
scratched together a set of "PC friendly" rules.
        They are currently on my website at
"http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/traveller".  Pick the "house-rules" button
and hit the link on the bottom of the page.  The economics comments are
based on MTU, where eco-damage concerns (we learned our lesson on Earth)
precludes heavy industrial mining.  So, Belt mining is a viable alternative.
        The only thing I had difficult reconciling was the *brutal* survival
roles required in the Belter proffession (speaking CT here, don\'t forget).
I did not include a "job hazard" step for a Belter trip, as I couldn\'t
really come up with situations that wouldn\'t force stable, well adjusted
folks to sell thier Seekers and become Merchants after it happened once.
Some suggestions as to "reasonable" risk factors and events are welcome...
I thought about some "mechanics" things like Pilot and Ship Boat rolls
required to avoid mishaps (3d hits collision damage, or some such) while in
the Belt, but that seems a touch hokey.  As I said, suggestions welcome.
        Anyway, they are there for your perusal...  please take a look and
let me know what you think.  I am going to design a small "PC-sized" Belter
ship tonight, roll up a Belter character and see how long it takes to starve
to death.  =)

I agree, but I tried to factor in the penetration potential of the LMG,
blowing through furniture that the SMG wouldn\'t.  I guess the speed would

The M2 Bradley is designed to carry six infantry.  The Divison 86 standard
infantry squad has eleven people.  Slight problem.

Back in the day, when we used M113A3s, we regularly got 15+ people in to a
single vehicle, with rucksacks.  This was not comfortable in the least,
especially after two weeks int he field, but it worked.  You could also get
four or five guys riding on the cargo hatch.  That was a great vehicle.

The biggest complaint from the grunts was that we needed an entire MOS to
drive the bloody things.  11M.  Anybody could drive a -113 with very little
training.  Not so with the Bradley.

In typing class, at Ft. Ben Harrison, (laugh away) they played a video, over

Actually there are dialects in Norway that are very hard to understand. 
Some are impossible if the speaker uses nothing but local words and tone.
My girlfriends friend is from a small place only a few hours away from 
the captial, were I live, keeps using words I never heard before. Its 
really peculiar.

You did not miss anything, I did.  I guess the warning label on the flu
medicine I took last night was accurate.  ;-)  Talk about truth in advertising.

The spreadsheet I used did have fuel scoops and a refinery capable of
refining the carried tankage in 48hrs.  Somehow it did not transfer from
the worksheet to the description.

I based it off of two things...

1.  I used the amount of hull space that was inhabited as the basis.  This
brings it up toabout 2% or so.

2.  It was all that was left after shoehorning the other goodies in.  ;-)

Aaargh!  Another thing that did not transfer from the worksheet to the
description were the missile magazines...

There were supposed to be two seperate magazines, one with 50 battery
rounds of conventional weapons and one with 25 battery rounds of nuclear
weapons.

Regarding gunners, the spreadsheet uses the MT crew calculations to
determine the number of gunners.  It uses control points modified by the
computer CP multiple.  I\'ve had some rather large ships where the ships
troops outnumbered the crew by three to one, and it was not a troopship.  

>Tech 16? In whose Y1119 navy?

The Imperial Navy in the Domain of Deneb.  The Susquehannas were built at
Vincennes, a TL16 world in Deneb Sector.  My current campaign is MT set in
the G:T timeline.

Good points.  Perhaps one or two hulls can be modified to fit this theory.

The two gunned gigs can take the role of fighters if that is necessary.  By
using fighters, a raider becomes pinned in a system unless she wishes to
abandon them should the need arise.  Also, adding a wing of fighters adds
another issue to the mix, maintenance and spares.  For a raider, fighters
should supplant and enhance the ship\'s effectiveness, not be the primary punch.

Perhaps when the TL-17 version slides off the ways we will have a few
fighters...

Actually the astronauts today are very aware of solar flares. You don\'t
want to be caught out in the open when one happens. I even think that
they on Mir have to pull into a special module during a flare.

        The other thing about that "house rule" is that it only applies to a
certain number of stars which are noted to be prone to violent flare
activity...  powerful enough to score temporary "hits" on non-FIB starship
computers during the length of the flare activity.
        The "small ones" aren\'t noteworthy and therefore I don\'t worry
players about them =)

Actually, it\'s not all that unusual, particularly in countries with long
histories of human settlement (thousands of years). I\'ve seen studies
(admittedly old) that said England had something like 300 or 350
mutually incomprehensible dialects of English.

The huge kicker in all of this is that these differences fade away
relatively rapidly with the onset of modern communications, particularly
when people move from the original homes to new colonies...that same
study looking at English dialects claimed that there were only 3
mutually incomprehensible dialects in the US, and their examples
(appalachian, cajun, and a dialect spoken on one island in South
Carolina) are all actually very heavily influenced by other languages
German, French (French Canadian,in fact which is recognized as a quite
different dialect of French) and an African language, respectively. (The
island in South Carolina was settled by slaves)

This is all from an old memory a long time ago, and any with better
linguistics skills feel free to chop, slice and dice this post as they
see fit.

ObTrav: While colonies settled by different ethnic/language groups may
start out having different languages, they will likely end up with one,
showing roots of all of the original languages yet be a different
language. Witness English, the prime example of exactly that process.

Even if you do know, in a jungle enviroment you could still not find the
enemy. A good source of Info on this would be most Vietnam era books. Some
Jungles were so dense that if you were not with in 2 ft of your buddies,
you could get lost. A firefight
that took place 200 ft away might as well have been a hundred miles away.

niether. the above represents a scenerio. no skill was present. I read a
story of a vietnam incounter; a patrol was hoofing it through a jungle, saw
some hefty movement unloaded into the bush thinking a VC patrol was about
to jump em, instead they got a really upset gorilla. who proceded to show
them why you don\'t piss off animals that are really strong.

I disagree in part. Both philosphies have strength and weakness, yes it is
a good idea to identify your enemy first but who is the enemy? there are a
zillion examples of the enemy in disquise as innocent civilians, the USA
has an informal policy. shoot anything that dos\'nt immediatly surrender.
When I was stationed in Korea on the DMZ our orders were. \'If you see
ANYONE in this area (the DMZ) during your patrol, shoot them first then see
who they were.\' 
	Read vietnam liturature, the troops were so harrassed by the tricks of the
enemy they would shoot at anything. Why do you think the soldiers had the
nick name \'Baby killers?\' (the VC used children with explosives strapped to
them as walking remote detonation mines.) Another example would be that you
have an enemy patrol in your back area, you have orders to identify your
target first then shoot, the enemy has orders to shoot everything. Who
wins? More then likely the enemy he knows he has no friendlys to worry about.

Even well trained and disciplined troops can panic and run out of ammo. 

In or about 1985, Bravo Company 1st/17th was stationed on the Korean DMZ
(they had been stationed there for about a year as I understand it) during
one of the nights a ground radar tech detected a lone enemy presence slowly
creeping toward the guard tower. The unit was put on alert, weapons were
manned and aimed at the location.
When everyone was ready the commander ordered the interperter to order the
intruder to surrender. The figure on the radar stopped. But did not
surrender. a few mins later the intruder started forward again. The signal
to fire was given and the unit poured hundreds of rounds into the area of
the intruder. A squad was sent in to identify the remains of the
individual. It was a mess. The target had been hit several times by most of
the weapons fire. They searched until they found all of the body parts
of... a Deer.

coolness under fire IMO is a situational event and should only come into
effect when you see the enemy firing at you or you see your buddies falling
dead around you or that grenade bounching into the room with you. Bigger
guns does not mean better sunglasses (cool eh?) Better firepower means
survivability. better survivability means more modifiers for coolness next
time you\'er in combat. Armor or distance and Experence generally mean
better coolness mods, if a soldier is protected from wpns fire or a pilot
knows he can hit his target before they know or react to his presence, or
if the M203 fire\'er is 300 ft away and can arc his shot to the target
without exposing himself too much. You can also have three different
critical failures for coolness.

1. A normal failure means you cannot activily aim in the firefight and may
run away. (what ever the book says)

2. A roll of a 4 on 3d means you are frozen in fear and cannot move (AT
ALL) while the firefight is occuring.

3. A roll of 3 on 3d could mean you beleave you feel you are invincible or
have super luck to enemy fire and will walk out into the firefight
causually shoot everything in sight (enemy) this type of failure is very
dangerous to friendlies. hmm what point value delusion is this?

Imagine an enemy in traveller that uses the vietnam era tactics on imperial
troops. Soon the troops would not want to leave starbase without a full
armed platoon to do R and R. A bad mix is soldiers with guns in an R and R
zone. (it\'s armed additude.) don\'t say it cannot happen. it has happened in
the past already. The Propaganda alone would force several alliances to
consider if it was worthwhile to be aligned with the goverment. A bad
enough terrorist group could cause the imperial garrison to want to decide
if cleansing the planet is a viable option.

who can take a building better the army or the marines?

the marines use machine guns and grenades.

the army, three year lease with option to buy.

On that note, I\'d like to see some kind of supplement that could detail
spaceflight (optionally, so the rule-challenged don\'t have a spasm) in
Traveller, along w/ \'primitive\' methods for auxilliary methods.  : )  Transfer
orbits, detailed mechanics, etc.  Something that could help me explain these

don\'t know how to express it, w/o what amounts to a lecture.

2)	No bays in designs under 1kton in size.  No 10t bays allowed.
3)	Ship size listed on the High Guard computer table is 
	considered to be the smallest size requiring that computer.
	This allows TL 11 worlds to build 99,999t ships.
4)	Fighters use Stefan Jones\' squadron rules from JTAS.
5)	Fighters use Stefan Jones\' close attack rules from JTAS (+2).
6)	Crew losses are taken in sections rather than in crew factors,
	as in JTAS.
7)	Walt Smith\'s area point defense and escort rules are allowed
	only for lasers.  Players must decide what ships are using
	either mode during the Battle Formation Step.
	Ships in the reserve may provide area point defense and escort
	for other ships in the reserve.
8)	Tactical Intelligence: general size and number will be 
	provided for as follows: hull size 0 (generally not revealed
	as carried craft), hull sizes 1-9, hull sizes A-J, hull sizes
	K-N, hull sizes P-Q, hull sizes R-Y. 
9)	Population Multipliers: all worlds are considered to have a
	population multipler of "5", except Esperanza which has a "2",
	and New Home which has an "8". 
10)	Systems: for simplicity sake, a system contains an inner system,
	including the world and any belts or gas giants, and an outer
	system, which is totally empty.  Ships in the outer system
	cannot be forced to battle.
11)	Planetary Surrender:  number of weapon factors required to
	force planetary surrender are equal to population factor * world
	TL (that\'s still close to 100). The requirement is doubled for
	worlds with naval bases, tripled for faction capitals (not
	cumulative).  If the world does not surrender, the enemy
	presence does not effect ongoing ship building.
	If a world does surrender, taxes received will be halved the
	first year (same if reconquered, due to economic damage). 
	Conquered repair facilities are available after 12 weeks and
	ship building facilities are available after 48 weeks.
	(the times in TCS for ship building facilities effectively 
	removed them from the campaign).
12)	Combat: Combats will be resolved in a fashion agreed to by all
	sides involved in the encounter and the moderator.  If no 
	agreement is reached in a timely manner, the moderator will 
	generate results randomly. Don\'t let that happen to you!
13)	Independent worlds of TL 7 or higher will have some form of
	system defense force.

Not all of em. : ) And only because the RCS Kelley Victrix came down and
strafed the thing w/ it\'s 76mj Plasma guns.  It got the RCN characters into
the action, too.
;-)

The Baby Bruisers weren\'t much of a problem, but the Bruiser itself took out
the G-carrier, and 4 RC Marines (2 NPCs) in heavy battle dress w/ plasma guns
before the KV came in and blew the sucker to hell.  That was a good adventure.
Fortunately, for the military campaigns, it was the "cast of hundreds"
approach where each player had several characters at different echelons
(commanding/officer types, enlisted/grunt types, etc), so the high fatality
levels (as befits the dangerous situations they were often in) didn\'t bug
much.  

With the civilian campaign, it was much different and those were the
characters that the players were more attached to.

The *only* Traveller material I\'ve see that deals with pop-up turrets
was in a Challenge magazine article on Q-ships. Can\'t remember
the issue #, though.

I always found interesting the illustration in FFS which showed the
gunner\'s station as being in the bottom part of a turret. This may
work for lasers but I always wondered how missles were loaded
into the launchers. I assumed the average ship-to-ship missile
was a short, squat cylinder rather than long and slender.

During the war, the pentagon was able to give its spin, which
(of course) was pretty enthusiastic.  After the war, opponents
weighed in with their own spin that it was useless (which, also
of course, was taken as the "true" evaluation by those that
were already inclined that way).  The real story is likely
in between.

You mean good enough freedom fighters, don\'t you? :)

Anyway, yes this is the goal.  It\'s how you equalise the technological gap
that will usually exist.  You can\'t win hearts and minds from inside an
APC, or, probably, from inside Battle Dress.  Toys don\'t win wars, people
do.

Well, up in the north of Sweden we *do* have a launch site. (Esrange -
http://www.ssc.se/esrange/esr_indx.html ) I know Norway has a satellite
tracking site (http://www.tss.no/info/) but I don\'t think they actually
launch anything from there. (Not that it\'s likely anything major will ever

There\'s a difference between the US Army in Vietnam - flushed with
conscripts, fighting an unpopular war far from home with an unfriendly
local populace - and (say) a professional army fighting in a jungle it
knows well.

If you can\'t tell the difference between small arms at 200ft and 200
miles, you should really be in the Navy.

Specific areas like the DMZ in Korea are *not* a good model for general

So buy low-light vision gear. Point being, if there was a NK
infiltration taking place nearby, you just a. told them where you are
and b. that you are awake.

The old joke: A junior officer from each of the services is ordered to
secure a house.

The Navy lieutenant (jg) orders someone to turn off all the lights, and
lock the doors and windows.

The Army 2nd Lieutenant occupies the building with his platoon, then
prepares to repel an assault.

The Marine 2nd Lieutenant has the building shelled from afar, and then
assaults the crater under cover of smoke.

The Air Force Lieutenant gets a three year lease with option to buy.

You want a good infantry fighting vehicle (Bradley) vice a `battlefield
taxi\' (M-113), you need to make changes. We did exactly the same thing
when we shifted from the FV-432 to the Warrior. It\'s like complaining
that a new warship has a different compliment to the one it\'s replacing.
It shouldn\'t be that hard to change the manning. It would be hard,
however, to make an IFV with all the capabilities of an M2 but seating
twice as many people.

Compare the M2 to other vehicles in the same timescale - BMP-1 and -2s;
Marders; BTRs. It\'s good kit.

I don\'t think that the US Army plans to swim it\'s fighting vehicles.

At the time, everyone thought they were doing great. It turned out that,
while they were hitting bits of SCUD, they were mostly spent boosters
and not the warheads. However, Patriot was *not* designed to kill
missiles, and the fact that it got some SCUDs was good news. The mod. to
make it an anti-missile missile postdates the Gulf War.

So, the manning levels got readjusted, and the fighting doctrine
changed.

Well, excepting that it was vulnerable to heavy machinegun fire; had
zero anti-tank capability; and was about half the speed of the tanks it
was supposed to support, yes.

I thought that 11 Mikes were the troops who fought from Bradleys, not
just the drivers.

1.   Magazine Query

Kurt asked:
>What would be a good size for the magazines on a 2000ton ship
>with one 50 ton missile bay?

Assumption: you are using MegaTraveller. ;-)

From the errata somewhere:
100-ton missile bays hold 100 missiles, broken into two battery-rounds of
50 missiles each.
50-ton missile bays hold 50 missiles, broken into 2 battery-rounds of 25
missiles each.

25 battery-rounds of nuclear missiles is 25 x 25 = 625 nuclear missiles =
62.5 kl, 43.75 tons, and costs MCr125.
50 battery-rounds of HE missiles is 50 x 25 = 1250 missiles = 125 kl, 62.5
tons, and costs MCr25.

...or about 13 disp tons in total.

Kurt, why not multiply your ammo by 3 or 4?
     100 battery-rounds of nukes is 100 x 25
          = 2500 missiles
          = 250 kl, 175 tons, MCr375.
     150 battery-rounds of HE is 150 x 25
          = 3750 missiles
          = 375 kl, 187.5 tons, MCr75.

In total, 250 + 375 = 625 kl (about 46 disp tons).

In comparison, one 50-ton bay (empty) is 675 kl.

2.   Bays as Magazines

What are people\'s views on the suggested use of bays as magazines? I mean,
I assume that you add the weight of the missiles when calculating "Loaded
Weight". For example, the rules state that a 100-ton bay can hold 13500
missiles. This is 675 tons of conventional missiles or 945 tons of nukes -
not an inconsiderable tonnage.

Well, it\'s as streamlined as the classic Empress

it appear a little smoother.

The wings are actually intended to be a means
of locomotion in the water, being flexable /
mechanical in nature.   I added a comment to
the drawing that should clear up your concerns....

Basically if you thought their might be a body of troops hiding in say a wood, 
you\'d squeeze off a few bursts from your GPMG hoping they\'d return fire. It was 
far from guaranteed effective, but even on excerises you\'d be suprised how

I used to think television shows and the movies would make this stuff up 
just for ratings.  But after discussing this with Clif and seeing that 
there are others who agree with him, maybe those shows aren\'t so far

I am reminded of the passage from the book _The Defense of Hill 781_
(set in Purgatory a.k.a. the National Training Center at Ft. Irwin), in
which the protagonist, Lieutenant Colonel A. Tack Always, who had spent
all of his career in airborne/light infantry units, had to command a
battalion task force in Purgatory, and couldn\'t leave until he beat the
OPFOR.  LTC Always realized at one point that he had commanded airborne
infantry companies that could put more dismounted infantrymen on the
battlefield than his entire mech infantry _battalion task force_.

Technology would play an important part in the linguistic development of the
colony world which has been described.  If the colony went through a period of
low technology as the population spread across the world\'s surface, it would
be expected that the various languages would not only remain in existance, but
additional dialects would likely arise in the backwaters.  Remember, when a
community is isolated, it is much more likely to go off on its own
linguistically.
On the other hand, if the colony enjoyed an advanced communications and
transportation system from the start, it becomes much more likely that the
dominant language, in this case German, would provide the basis for a new
world tongue after several generations.  
In the early years of the colony, resources would probably not be available
for the luxury of multiple, competing, communications infrastructures, and co-
ordinating the small population base would demand the use of a "lingua franca"
based on the language understood by the majority of the populace.  With
universal electronic communication and gravitic mobility present, communities
would not be able to develop or maintain their own dialects in isolation, and
would be subject to a homogenizing influence by the mass culture.  This is not
to say that all differences would be quickly wiped out, but it would be likely
that a high tech version of this colony would see the minority languages meld
into the majority over generations. 
Even if there were some sort of "Scandinavian" elite, barring some odd
discrepancy in birth rates, it would remain outnumbered by the Germanic
underclass.  This situation is rather similar to the situation encountered by
the Normans in England after the conquest.  There, the French speaking
aristocracy was assimilated by the Anglo-Saxon majority, generating a new
language in the process.  IMO, this would occur much quicker in our
hypothetical colony, as all of the populace shares common linguistic roots.
For those interested in a good introduction to this subject and the
possibilities, I can recommend that you pick up a copy of "The Story of
English", based on a PBS show of the same title.  It\'s an easy read, and very
informative.

Using Patriot in the ABM role was important in the \'91 Gulf War,
regardless of how effective it really was.  It helped maintain the
morale of the REMFs that were stationed in SCUD target areas.  There are
few things more terrifying than a weapon against which you have _no_
defense.  And, since the aforementioned REMFs were the ones giving those
of us further forward the logistical support we needed to do _our_ jobs,
keeping their morale up (so that they would do their jobs) was a _good_
thing.

That could be extraordinarily difficult  to do from a mechanical
standpoint.  However, if you use the fact that they are tanks,
presumably with baffles and pumps, you could postulate a locomotion
based on pumping fluid around inside the wings and thus causing an
undulating motion.  I believe spiders use this method to move their
legs, they pump blood into them to extend them.  If you then hypothesize
that an arachnid race designed the vessel... or at the very least
contributed to the wing design...

The radiation from a flare requires several *meters* of water (or the
equivalent) as shielding. Metallic shielding is useless as the high
energy protons will generate *secondary* particle showers that will
result in *worse* damage on the other side. 

Even at TL-15 I can\'t see a spacesuit being able to protect against a
major flare. 

Suits protect from *normal* radiation. And may provide some protection
in the early stages of a flare or in a planetary radiation belt. Not in
a gas giant\'s radiation belt though.

Think of flares as being like hurricanes. The only protection is being
behind something big and solid.

Oh yeah, flares are directional. In other words, they affect a conical
area extending out from the surface of the star. The edges will be a
bit fuzzy. 

So the mainworld may be quite safe while a belter 60 degrees away is
getting fried.

Any of the resident astronomers know how "wide" flares are? And what
typical radiation levels are?

The problem with GIF/JPG is that they really aren\'t very changeable. I
prefer to work in a vector based program (Corel draw in my case) I ca
convert to GIF/JPG but thent he plan becomes very akward. 

As far as compression. I\'ve sent a number of Dplans around the web, in
many formats. GIF/JPG even zipped is usually larger than the pdf
formated file. I also work big, 1/2 inch squares mostly, and the latest
I\'m working on is 1 inch, fully play able for 25mm. These files as
GIF/JPG are large, as vectors larger, while the pdf\'s are smaller by a
large factor. 

Also I have never, intentionally, "locked" any of the data in the pdf\'s. 

Another plus to pdf is that text (discriptions, adventures, etc.) can be
included. The conversion process to Gif/JPG may be tedious but there are
a number of plus\' to the format that makes that worthwhile (IMHO).

The Sayat Board for Optimization and Operationalization of Munitions is
belatedly pleased to offer:

MANLY-MAN-POWERED DUELLING FIGHTER

Hull: 35 displacement ton, needle airframe configuration (pour la style);
internal structure for 1G, hull plating 2cm superdense (AV 28) 
Controls: Dynamic linked; two bridge workstations (duelist, electronics)
and one regular (gun crew)
Electronics: 30,000km laser & 3000km radio communicators; 30,000km PEMS
and 30,000km LADAR; one standard TL-12 computer
Amenities: extended life support; no grav compensation (uses too much
energy); no airlocks. 
Weaponry: TL-C 25Mj N-PAW (see below); 30,000km beam pointer; no MFD
(unsporting) 
Power: 308 cubic meters of manly man, producing 1.55 MW; 100 hours fuel 
Drives: none
Cost: MCr10.368 (not including manly men, loincloths, whip) 
Spare: 46m3 and a few kilowatts

25Mj N-PAW (TL-C)
Diamter: 1.875m    Length 15m         ROF 10           MW input 0.694 
Volume:  55.67m3   Mass: 44.763 tons  Cost: MCr4.306 
Short Range: 30,000km (effective range 31,063km) 
Pen Value: 25.9 /	12.9 / 6.5 / 3.2

Designed using FFS (original), plus CSC for "rower" power source.

Note that every component is muscle-powered.  Grav compensation and
contragrav lifters couldn\'t be included as their power requirements
outstrips the rate at which you can pack more manly men into a hull.  It
_would_ be feasible to add ion drives for limited in-space maneuvering,
but at extremely low accelerations, and I suspected this might fall
outside the scope of the challenge.

Bon appetit!

Without taking sides in the Great Debate, I\'ll sum up a few arguments
for each position (these are from memory of the debate a while back, so
I may have forgotten some issues):

FOR PARALLEL DECKS:

1.  More efficient dirtside cargo handling.  Parallel deck designs can
have more of the cargo area closer to the ground than most perpendicular
deck designs.

2.  Resistance to meson gun fire.  Of all streamlined hull forms in High
Guard, the needle/wedge is most resistant to meson gun fire.  A
perpendicular deck needle/wedge ship would have a vast number of
relatively small decks, as ships of this configuration tend to be long,
relative to height and width.  Perpendicular decks are most efficient in
more compact hull forms, such as the sphere or flattended sphere.  These
hull forms are much more vulnerable (under High Guard) to meson gun fire
than the needle/wedge.

3.  Stability on the ground.  If one intends to land a given starship,
then one has three basic options:

	a.  Design the ship with parallel decks, and land it much as one would
land a 20th century airplane.

	b.  Design the ship using a compact hull form, with perpendicular
decks.  This works all right, unless the ship needs to be built to
resist meson guns under High Guard.

	c.  Design the ship to be a tall tail-lander.  If the designer chooses
the needle/wedge hull form (for High Guard resistance to meson gun
fire), and further chooses perpendicular decks, then the ship on the
ground would be a relatively tall structure, on a relatively narrow
base.  Such a design would be unusually vulnerable to high winds or
seismic tremors.

4.  Aerodynamics.  Ships optimized for atmospheric performance tend to
be long and narrow (needle/wedge, cone, or cylinder configurations). 
These tend to favor parallel deck design.  Further, ships intended to
spend significant amounts of time in atmosphere are, by definition,
expected to spend time inside the gravity well of whatever body holds
the atmosphere within which they are expected to operate.  Once gravity
becomes a dominant issue in ship orientation, then, in an aerodynamic
hull form such as the needle/wedge, deck orientation becomes important. 
Under gravity, in an aerodynamic hull form, parallel decks offer the
advantage of having the decks aligned with the force of planetary
gravity. 

5.  Aesthetics.  There are some who think that a needle/wedge ship just
looks kewl.  (This is most important in yachts [which truly _must_ look
kewl, regardless of practical considerations] and warships [which need
to have that "right-end/ wrong-end" factor, to achieve maximum
intimidation].)  Since (as mentioned above) such ships work best with a
parallel deck layout, such ships will generally _have_ a parallel deck
layout.

FOR PERPENDICULAR DECKS:

1.  Less need for artificial gravity.  A perpendicular deck ship can use
1-G of thrust to provide a reasonable semblance of gravity.  This works,
even if the artificial gravity fails entirely.  A parallel deck ship\'s
crew would have far more problems functioning effectively than that of a
perpendicular deck ship\'s, should the artificial gravity have problems.

2.  Lower power usage for artificial gravity/inertial compensation.  As
a corollary of point 1, a perpendicular deck ship can get by with less
inerial compensation, and thus use less power.  Since the power plant of
a ship is among the most expensive components, this means that, Dton for
Dton, a perpendicular deck ship will be less expensive, and therefore
more profitable, than a parallel deck ship. 

3.  Less need for contra-grav drives.  Since perpendicular deck ships
tend to be tail-landers, they have little or no need for a CG drive in
atmosphere (their main drive thrust will be directly opposed to the pull
of gravity anyway).  As in point 2 above, this means less power draw,
and fewer crewmembers required, and therefore lower costs (and greater
profitability).  Parallel deck ships, OTOH, will need either honkin\' big
CG drives or long runways to launch from dirtside.

4.  More efficient armoring.  In T4\'s FF&S2, armor is purchased based on
surface area.  Since compact hull forms, such as the sphere, are best
suited for perpendicular deck ships, perpendicular deck designs will
need less mass and volume of armor to achieve a given thickness.  This
means that a smaller (and thus less power-hungry) maneuver drive will be
needed to move a perpendicular deck ship.  Again, this results in a
smaller power plant, and fewer crew needed to operate the ship. 
CHA-CHINGGG!

5.  Many ships never land.  If the ship is not intended to sit on the
dirt, why design it to roll its belly in the mud?  Most ships over a few
hundred Dtons rarely (if ever) actually land.  Given all the factors in
favor of perpendicular decks, why design around an improbable event?

BOTTOM LINE:

If, IYTU, artificial gravity and inertial compensation are proven
technologies, and configuration issues argue in favor of needle/wedge
ships, then parallel decks make more sense.  If, OTOH, artificial
gravity/inertial compensation are prone to failure, and/or
configuration/cost analysis favors compact ship designs, then go with
the perpendicular deck concept.

Two items:

1.  SayBOOM - C\'est bon!  (Yes, I\'ve been in Louisiana a bit too

2.  Exactly how many manly men are required for this design?  And how
many girly men would be needed for the same power output?  (Girly men
and/or scrawny neighbor boys* being cheaper per each than manly men.)

Still ROTFLMAO....

        Using a 500-ton, Close Structure hull, the Belter Refinery Ship
(TypeGN) is This is the atypical "Clan" Belter refinery ship. There are
several dozen of these ships in use throughout the planetoid belts of every
region of the Terran Sphere.
          It is performance-rated at jump-1, 1-G acceleration and 5EP. Fuel
tankage for 55 tons supports the power plant and 1 jump-1. The ship is
fitted with fuel scoops and a purification plant.
        Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/1.
        There are 14 staterooms, no standard low berths and no emergency low
berths.
         The ship has 5 turrets. 3 turrets each carry a single mining laser.
For defense it has the last two each carrying three sand-casters organzied
as 1 battery per turret and an agility of 0. There is no magazine and are no
nuclear weapons normally carried.
          There is 1 ship\'s vehicle. A 20-ton launch is carried.
          Cargo capacity is 195 tons. 
          The hull is partially streamlined.
          An onboard Ore Smelter/ Refinery is carried, capable of up to 31
tons per hour processing.
          There are 0 tons of waste space.
          The Belter Refinery Ship (Type GN) requires a crew of 10. 1 Pilot,
1 Navigator, 2 Engineers, 5 Gunners, 1 Flight Ops and 1 Service Crew are
required. Two 4-person mining teams are also carried.
          The Flight Ops crewman operates the Ship\'s Boat.
          The ship costs MCr125.53, including architects fees and takes 64
months to build.
          The "Mining Team" are two four man teams who work in 8-on/8-off
shifts doing nothing else but ensuring that a steady stream of raw material
is flowing into the maw of the refinery. The sand-caster gunners are usually
rotated through the mining laser turrets to spell those gunners off during
operations. A well-seasoned team can fill the hold of a Cape Breton in less
than 7 hours
        ----

        The SSD is at my web page
("http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/traveller") on the "Jane\'s Catalog" page.
This ship is designed for use with the "Belter Operations Rules" that Kevin
Walsh and I are tinkering with.  An explanation of these rules are found at
the bottom of the "House Rules" page on my site.

        Presuming that she refuels for free by skimming and operates as a
"Clan" ship paying shares not salaries, she needs one load a month at a PPT
Breakpoint of 1,442.14 Cr per ton to break even.  Presuming that she can do
two round-trips to the Belt in a month, has someone on board with a
Prospecting skill and someone on board with Admin-1 and Broker-1, she can
pretty much make money under any conditions.  Execept combat, where her
three mining lasers each function as Pulse Lasers -1.

        The seven-hour turn-around time is a bit of a marketing brochure.
It presumes almost pure ore going through the smelter.  The average will be
closer to *70* hours (10% average purity).

        As always, comments, corrections and questions are always welcome!

Polyethylene (Glad or Saran Wrap (TM)) has equivalent radioprotection
value to concrete, thickness for thickness (50% gamma attenuation over
6cm).

I would consider long-chain fatty acids with side chains to prevent
peroxidation (provide steric [spatial] hindrance, as far more likely to
be free radical mediated) more plausible from a biochemical standpoint
than lead compounds, which would have to be either in porphyrin
ring-like structures (like haemoglobin\'s iron or B12\'s cobalt), or
deposited in salt form (hydroxyapatites and other phosphates in bone) ;
lead, like all potentially reactive metals, would require special
handling systems analogous to the iron transport system found in most
earthly life.

(There is value in \'cellulite\'... ;-) )

The other option is to have a \'radiator\' array on the back with
compounds circulating through that convert the ambient radiation to
chemical energy, as per Leonard\'s \'plant\'. This could be an example of a
successful evolutionary adaptation to the environment that all complex
forms have adopted on the world.

In particular, asthma.

In general :-
Autoimmunity and hypersensitivity are likely to be worse if the immune
system is enhanced.
Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) is a good example, as is scleroderma.

Immune system failure is lethal without complex support. End-stage HIV
infection and post-chemotherapy marrow suppression are useful examples.

The daily requirement for a minimum level of radiation is a good one ;
adds colour (as well as being a \'unique health risk\'), as does Leonard\'s
\'plant\'.

I suggest that you check out the conditions that "hard rock" miners
used to put up with, and even the ones they *still* put up with.

And then check out the conditions in places like the Yukon or the
Australian opal fields. 

You have to keep in mind the fact that many prospectors *aren\'t*
"stable, well adjusted folks". And that *nobody* really believes that
*they* are going to make the mistake that gets them killed.

The standard "stony" bodies aren\'t worth a lot. The nickel iron ones
are likely worth *less* (you can at least get oxygen out of "stony"
bodies). The big payoffs are chrondites (CHON compounds, basicly
complex semi-organic "sludge"), and for the belts that are far enough
out "icy" bodies. The *huge* payoffs will be "anomalous" bodies. Things
like stony bodies that have decent crystals of various types (not
normal gemstones though, I\'ll have to come up with a list), high levels
of the rarer elements or nickel-iron bodies with high amounts of heavy
elements. 

Keep in mind that a lot of things such as uranium and gold tend to stay
with the stony materials rather than the nickel-iron ones.

It\'s also possible that strange things can be found on the rare bodies
where the boundary between stony and nickel-iron is accessible.

Well, for one thing, ships *don\'t* have to land like airplanes. The
Delta-X proved that. And in fact, that would be a *better* setup for a
ship that is landing in "unimproved" areas. All you need is a medium
sized hunk of exposed rock. As opposed to *hoping* that the long, flat
stretch of land isn\'t too soft, and doesn\'t have "potholes" hidden by
vegetation. 

But consider this, if the grav compensators *fail* while you are under
power, in a "perpendicular" ship, you just got a lot heavier and anyone
who was actually walking around might get hurt. In a parallel ship, you
are now sitting or standing on a *wall*, and *will* get hurt unless you
are strapped into a chair that is fastened to the deck. All
bow-to-stern corridors are now open shafts. Ouch!

Also, it can be argued (though admittedly the rules don\'t say) that it
takes extra power for a "parallel" ship. Because it has to neutralize
all of the ships thrust, and *then* generate aritifical gravity at
right angles to the thrust.

A "perpendicular" ship only has to neutralize enough of the thrust for
the remainder to provide "normal" gravity. 

I haven\'t gotten around to trying to draw a "perpendicular" Type S yet,
as I don\'t have figures handy on how many tons to allocate for each
system (drives, fuel, etc). But my first rough cut at it indicates that
it should have only three decks. Lowest deck would be engineering, with
cargo space and fuels tanks around it. Second deck would be "living
areas" (staterooms and common spaces), and third level would be the
control room, which would have a full 360 degree field of view (ie it\'s
built under a transparent "dome" that forms the nose of the ship)

Basic shape of the ship would be a round nosed cone (think of an Apollo
capsule with landing legs). And this config has the advantage that it
can (in emergency situations) make an unpowered re-entry on a world
with a thin or better atmosphere and a decent hydro percentage,
possibly even without hydro if it\'s got a decent sized parachute
fitted. Yep, just like the old TL-8 capsules, re-enter tail first, and
splashdown, or "hard land". 

Sure the ones with an airframe config can (in theory) glide in. But
they\'ll need power to steer. 

ps. I bet that sufficiently gutsy Scouts have made covert landings by
imitating a meteor in the "capsule" config.

However, most people are capable of learning more than one language, and many
people want their children to keep their tounge alive.

Basically you can justify either outcome. It depends on the history of the
colony. If the dominant group have a political agenda that requires the
eradication of the minority languages, it becomes much more difficult to
maintain them. There are examples of communities that failed and communities
that managed. For instance, the Swedes succeded fairly quickly in eradicating
Danish from those old Danish counties they took over in the 17th Century,
while the Germans failed to do the same with the Danish in South Jutland.

Personally, I prefer a mixture of the two approaches.  For
example...

Attributes:  Let the player distribute points for Attributes, but a
portion of those points are randomly generated.  This way the
characters are NOT balanced...and that is a good thing, IMO.  Using
the Traveller 2-12 scale and 6 Attributes, give the player 42+2d6
points to distribute with no Attribute lower than 2 or greater than
12. In FUDGE terms everything is FAIR and you have 1d6 free levels.

Careers:  On entry into a career the character receives "basic
training" in a few core skills.  In many careers you *don\'t* get a
complete choice as to what you practice/learn, but you should always
get *some* choice.  Each term the player rolls for a skill based on
career/branch and for one based on current mission, then chooses a
skill.  The freely chosen skill can represent a hobby, but it can
also represent the character\'s efforts to develop skill in a
specific area.  I don\'t use "survival" rolls, instead it represents
injury and forced mustering out, but I\'d *like* to make it a "life
events" roll that represents a range of possible life altering
events.

I *really* like the concept of careers, as opposed to free-form
distribution of points for skills and further attribute enhancement.
Developing a character through a career system is the "solitare
Traveller" I played for years when I couldn\'t find a group, and as
such it helps to have some randomness to make it more gamey. 

OTOH, when we\'re whipping up a character for a game, I\'m just as
happy with a completely subjective system..."just describe your
character, strengths, weaknesses, quirks, who is she, what can she
do, where did she come from and we\'ll take it from there."  ;->
Given the bare bones, I\'m fine with players fleshing a character out
during play.

As I said, I like a mixture of approaches.

it. True story: the Air Force had a program to create this great

mission. In general nobody thought it was worth a damn.

	It\'s also the ONLY aircraft so vital to modern warfare that NATO
supposedly operated them jointly. Not borrowed from member air

It\'s the AWACS. Anybody want to argue about whether AWACS is useful?

Oops! Forgot to answer the part about communications. 

Flares disrupt communications on earth because they affect the
ionosphere and the Van Allen belts. Most long range comm on earth is
either HF bounced off the ionosphere or satellite comms that have to
pass thru it.

The flares change the positions and reflectivity of these layers. So
ground to orbit comms will be disrupted on planets with enough of an
atmosphere. Comms between spaceships will not be affected. 

Any flare that will affect computers inside the ship is going to *kill*
people. Unless the ship has some sort of shielded "storm cellar" for
people to take refuge in. 

I\'d assume that most ships are built such that if you place the stern
(with all the engines and reactor) towards the star, you\'ll be shielded
well enough in the rest of the ship.

There\'s a DNA reparation mechanism that involves cutting the nitrogenated base without
even touch the sugar backbone (so DNA chain remains un-breaked) in the first step. But
then, when the new nitrogenated base has to be introduced there, as there\'s no enzyme
(yet found) that enables the cell to just add the correct nitrogenated base at such
places, the cell makes a break at the sugar chain, removes that ribose (without base)
and add a nucleotide there.

But there are some problems that can be solved without cutting the DNA double strand
(or even just one strand) : now i remember the pirimidine dimers that UV radiation
creates (with one pirimidine in one strand making covalent bonds with the next
pirimidine in the same strand) can be solved (as they are a "relatively" common event)
without breaking the strands, with an enzyme that needs to be activated by the
sunlight (look for photoreactivation in a genetic textbook).

Maybe i shouldn\'t have used the word "adapted". I wasn\'t talking about natural
selection of the individuals that best fit that place. I was telling that it\'s
perfectly feasible that in some conditions a species has some pressure over it that
prevents it to be (i.e:) more fertile, with a larger life span, a big population...
This doesn\'t mean that they aren\'t (natural selectioned=) "adapted" (now the right use
of the word) to live there, but that they haven\'t, i.e.  maximum resources access
(because of other species with wich they compete), optimal life conditions (in wich i
don\'t include that high levels of radiation, i don\'t care how much good DNA repairing
systems or alike they have, high radiation will always cause a higher mutation rate,
infertility, and higher mortality than if the world wasn\'t so irradiated) etc, so when
they  have a "break" of some of these pressures, they can extend the ecological niche
they are at. No natural selection (i mean, evolution with best fit mutations being
favoured) is involved here.

Just imagine this example: a group of humans (say 100) of an Africa tribe (they live
in the jungle, without contact with other humans) suddenly have a "bad year" let\'s say
that they (i don\'t care why) cannot harvest all the food they need : so that year,
there will be some hunger, maybe the youngest will die (not all, as when some of them
have already died there\'s more food for the other) and then the population reaches a
number of 65 people. Imagine this situation is the same year after year, so the
population of 65 remains the same size (it cannot grow more, there\'s no food). But
then, someyear, things go better and they can increase their food availability : sure
this population will have some changes : more children will get to adult (they won\'t
die starved), maybe (this is not always true) women will have more children, they will
live longer lifes (they are now optimally fed) etc... This was the idea i was trying
to explain (in my horrible english)

Again, i\'ll have to put that LONG word on the subject ;)

As most Traveller ships seem to be built more like space capable tanks than
normal spaceship (even merchants got armour 60 in Striker for example) I
think canon Trav ships are more or less immune to flares.

How many jumps of fuel does it have? (IIRC jump fuel calaclation in MT is

Okay, 20std for 10 crew seems reasonable.

Good, although thinking about it, against small merchants, one or two
missile volleys should be enough, with a bit of lasering if required.

Giving the ship too many missiles might encourage it to take the sort
of risks that get it killed instead of coming home with another half-dozen
kills.

I suppose it depends on how far behind the lines you want it.

TL16 on a 2000std raider designed to go after free traders, subbies and
corsairs seems a bit overkill.
On a deep penetration raider which tends to take casualties due to bad
luck, it seems to be giving away technology to the enemy.
On the Vargr border, you could even argue for using tech 13 or 14.

Its like the battleship/battle rider arguement all over again.
I can see your point and there will be times when flying a carrier
gives you the choice between leaving your fighters and risking the
defense fleet getting too close.

My guess is that both designs would happen and in each case there
will be times when you have the wrong ship in the wrong place.

FFS1 does not distinguish between them.

DGP\'s MTJ#4 pg 78-9 offered MT 360 degree turrets and popup turrets as
part of their Custom Ship Add-Ons article

"360 degree Turret
The 360 degree turret is a special rotating ball that allows a nearly
spherical field of fire.  It is secured to a telescopic boom.  A cutout
device is fitted to keep the weapon inside the turret from firing on its
own ship or on the boom.  If these are used move one column up in the
batteries bearing table.  One disadvantage of the design is its
vulnerability to enemy fire.  For this reason some captains choose to
"man" this turret remotely or by robot brain."

"Pop-up Turret
To conceal completely the fact that a ship is armed, the turret can be
concealed behind sliding panels.  When the panels slide back, the turret
extends to its firing position in about 2 seconds.  Only unmanned
turrets can be concealed in this way.  When calculating the volume of
the turret, multiply by 1.5."

Pop Up Turrets are [according to DGP] illegal [I think this idea is
bogus myself]

"To locate a piece of illegal equiptment for sale:
Difficult, Streetwise or Intrusion, Bribery or Forgery, 1 day
Referee: This task increases to Formidable if law level is 8+, decreases

Actually Norway has a launch site, Andoeya, where small high altitude
weather and aurora instruments are launched. There was actually a 
very bad incident last year (or maybe in 1997) where the Russians
had been within inches of launching a counterstrike because nobody
had informed them that Norway was launching. They thought it was 
a missile.

The power ammounts CSC gives for muscle power seem to be somewhat
greater than those listed in previous Traveller publications.  I think
that they are somewhat high.  Your manly men are generating 5,000 watts
per m^3.  At 70 kg each 1 m^3 would be 14.286 manly men, each producing
350 watts, people do not produce that much power.

Challege 53\'s Wet Navy design sequences [by Terry McInnes] indicated
that "The basic value for any given species that is capable of rowing is
half the species averageweight in kilograms.  The average human weighs
70 kilograms.  Therefore, the basic human rowing value is 35 - measured
in watts of power produced by an individual human.  This basic wattage
is modified by ability.  A rowers ability is determined by the total die
modifier received for Strength, Endurance, [MT rules stat/5 round down]
and Small Watercraft skill level.  For each point of rowing ability the
rower is able to increase rowing ability by 40% of the basic wattage
value."

Suppose that our rowing crew was [as you have indicated] very manly.  We
could call them Str 10+ End 10+ with Small Watercraft-2.  They would
therefore have a DM of +6 and produce 119 watts of power each. 
Therefore your 0.694 MW (694,000 watts) of weapon power input would
require 5,832 manly men. [The whole design would require 13,025 manly
men.  5,832 manly men will have take up more than 308 cubic meters. [I
suspect that the 308 m^3 volume is for the volume of their bodies alone
& does not include room to actually row in if so 308 m^3 of the manly
men will weigh 308 tons (using the humans are as dense as water
simplifying assumption).  At 70 kg each this would be 4,400 manly men. 
If we assume that our manly men are _very_ manly with Str 15 End 15 and
Small Watercraft 5 they will each generate 189 watts & you will need
only 3,672 of them to generate the power for the PAW.  Total craft power
requirements for the ship will be 8,201 very manly men.  They will _not_
fit in the ship.

I think it might be a bit difficult to find 8,201 men with Str 15, End
15 and Small Watercraft 5 however I suppose that I could make the
sacrifice of helping you look for them Kenji....

If however you were to reduce the rate of fire on the weapon, lower its
maximum power, reduce hull armor etc [everything Sayboom hates] you
might have a viable design.

Above 5,000sdt, the decks on a perpendicular thrust ship are large enough
to be efficient, even in a needle design.

Below 5,000sdt, the classic design is a flying saucer with its engine
in the belly. It flies "sideways" in atmospheres as though parallel
decked but has perpendicular thrust for spaceflight.

(Its a classic design because I believe that the Vilani were using
 them for thousands of years before the Solomani wingless 747s arrived.)

The bottom line is parallel to direction of flight in atmosphere,
perpendicular to direction of thrust in space.

When you have to do both its a compromise in the design.

Given todays technologies perhaps... but how long

ContraGravity, robotics, advanced plastics, a few

If you happen to be a high-ranking KGB mole intent on killing as many
Americans as possible at the highest possible price to be paid for by the
US Treasury, yes.

It\'s too tall, too expensive, and you need too bloody many of them to move
a company of infantry.

Y\'know, the Russians found out a neat fact about IFVs in Afghanistan. NCOs
tend to stay in \'their tank\' and their troops tend to cluster near it,
becasue it is big, armoured and has the squad\'s support weapons.

So when they get hit by anti-tank weapons (which are not in short supply in
modern armies), they blow up real good and kill most all the squad.

An unarmed battlefield taxi has a major advantage. Nobody is going to make
the fatal mistake of trying to fight out of one.

If you want a tank, buy a tank. If you want a ATGW platform, get a M113 and
put TOW on it. If you want something to carry infantry and protect them
from artillery splinters on the way there, buy an APC.

Dont try to do it all in one platform.

In my own incarnation, the jump drive & power plant were gone or
inoperative (safety, you know), but there was an internal battery (which
was bled to from the power supplied to the ship for lights, tour panels,
etc) and the thruster plates hadn\'t been removed.  Certainly it couldn\'t
take off like that, but it could sort of slide across the floor...

There was enough energy in those old batteries to get the thing across the
museum, through the wall, and most of the way across the city (crashing
through living rooms as it went) before the authorities caught up with it.

By the way, did you notice that on the Leedor map the Marquis\' palace is
almost directly "east" of the museum, and on the museum map, that happens
to be the direction the scout ship is oriented (giggle).

Lets not cloud the priorities here.  The question is, how many missiles
*should* the ship carry?

The mission is deep commerce raiding.  That means the ship will be fighting
200 to 10,000 ton merchants (possibly larger), and likely running from
almost any military vessel (except those it can fight without a real risk
of damage).  This strategy will keep it operating for many weeks away from
resupply.

Ok, lets assume it\'s primary tactics will be to lie in wait near a jump
point or previously identified pass by point for unescorted merchants, then
pop out of stealth and say "your money or your life", whereapon the Zho
merchie surrenders, gets in its lifeboats, and the ship is vapourized by
laser fire (assuming there is enough time before the Cavalry arrives), or
the merchie decides to fight, it takes an average of, say, 10 rounds to
destroy, using 10 battery-rounds of missiles.

At that point the tactic dictates jumping to another system before the zho
SDBs, cruisers and escorts catch up.

So one battle every week, possibly two if there is a nearby warship that
can intercept before jumping, some damage will be taken.

I\'d guess that the deployment time is not more than 10 weeks.  War can
alter cicumstances so much in that time that a redeployment somewhere else
might be needed.  So in ten weeks they\'ll get into no more than 10 battles
(one with the merchant, one with escort, then a week in jump, then a week
setting up and fighting the next battle) involving 100 battery rounds.

Now, multiply the estimate by two.

I\'d bring along about 200 battery rounds, evenly divided between nukes (to
be used on the military ships) and conventional (for merchies).  I think
that makes about 19.5 dtons, not a big penalty volume-wise.

Why take up the hardpoints without a weapon?  I saw this \'option\' as either
silly or specifically for "upgradable" ships which were built (to a budget)
with an empty bay for future refitting.  Also could be used for older ships
which have been refitted with one less bay weapon, but the empty "bay
socket" is still there.

My problem when using MT is usually that I don\'t have enough hardpoints for
the weapons I want to install.

What was \'General\' about the attack?  Were there other episodes?  Did other

I\'ve been gaming various RPGs for 19 years and I have NEVER come across
something like this with any game group.  The only \'ritual\' I have ever seen
is the stereo typical and often heated discussion of what topping to order
on the mid game pitza.

As I understand it the Earth\'s radiation shield is  its  magnetic
field ... could a TL15 PLSS unit have a high-energy magnetic coil
(good for an hour, say) to generate  a  strong  enough  field  to
protect the suit occupant during EVAs?  And would a field of this

believe it.  So far our only model for this has been 20th century European
langs., which have admittedly stayed pretty constant.  But this could also
be a function of our liberal civilization, economics, and media bias.  If
tech has such a homogenizing influence, why do we still have the "Eubonics"
question?   I\'m just using that as an example, but there is still a
significantly variant English dialect spoken in all major American cities,
suposedly the most media saturated in the world, and therefore subject to
the homogenization.
If the colony wasn\'t as liberal or democratic, social classes might be much
more isolated than we would imagine.  It would not have to be the upper
classes after all that keep their language.  If the Danes found themselves
as the housecleaners and yard sweepers, they might end up keeping their
language since no one bothered to teach them any German beyond "clean this."

Interesting, I must have run into a load of badly assembled PDFs.

True, especially if large amounts of text are incorporated.  But, most
of
the deck plans that I have seen just use a small legend.

Bottom line, I can live with either method.  [Although, I\'m still firmly
entrenched on the GIF/html side.]  :-)

        Well, if that was the case, you\'d expect that the HG radiation
damage table would say "Computer -n/ Crew -n" on the same roll, but they
don\'t.  In the RealWorld(tm) you are probably right, but I made my decision
based on the game mechanics.
        Maybe an END save or some such for each crew member or they take
radiation damage if the computer gets smoked by a flare?

Me too.

A lot of people have been using the PDF software to scan written
documents, then just saving the scans (without running OCR), so you get
pages of high-resolution pictures when a few k of text would do the trick.
 Mind you, I\'ve seen the same done with GIF and JPEG, too.

Done right, PDF uses decent data compression.

I believe the former would be the Famille Spofulam philosophy, while the

As long as we\'re being practical & rational, could someone calculate the
number of such people (or at least, say, Str-F/End-F) on Sylea in M:0?

It\'s as minimized power-wise as it can be -- since it has no maneuver
drives, the hull armor isn\'t a power drain; the discharge energy was per
the customer\'s request, and the ROF is as low as is allowed in the FF&S
book.  It\'s legal, just stupid.

Go on then - point out the advantages of the BMP-1 or -2 over the M2,
and then look at the list of disadvantages.

Yep, height is about the only thing a BMP has over a Bradley. Obtained
at the cost of a chronic MANPRINT failure in the rear of the vehicle
(have you ever *seen* a BMP up close) and a worthless turret. Oh, did I
point out the piss-poor fuel tank location too?

Bridges, either existing or manufactured. The only time it\'s worth
swimming a vehicle is when it\'s assaulting from the sea. And even then,
it\'s not that bright. Ask a US Marine how much they like riding in the
LVTP-7.

Bad use of their kit by the Russians does not make US kit poor.

When used properly, this isn\'t such a problem. Also, look to the up-
armouring of IFVs (like the Warrior).

Of course, a M-113 would be lagging way behind the tanks (if the tanks
are using their superior speed), or dragging the speed of operations
(and thus the operational and tactical mobility) down with it.

(ObTrav: Damn. This is an argument for Battlepod infantry rather than
Battle Dress. I hate battlepods).

And what if you\'re caught in a M-113? At least you have some chance in a
M2. In an M-113, the enemy rounds are coming through the sides and you
have *one* M-2 MG to return fire with - if anyone can poke their head
out the hatch.

if you need them all, and you can\'t afford one of each - get the best
compromise.

Of course, a mech infantry task force can sit back a bit and inflict
some suppressing fire on that leg infantry company. Even better, if it\'s
a really a task force (i.e. one company of infantry have been traded for
a company of tanks) the defenders are in a world of hurt. Tanks, IFVs
and supporting troops against leg infantry?

True to a point...but it will depend on what part of a war we\'re talking about.
The vast majority of a warship\'s crew are "females" - the engineers,
navigators, technicians, service crew, even most of the command crew.
It\'s only the pilots, gunners and marines (and the CO) who are "male".

How many "females" does it take to put one "male" infantryman into
a front line combat role and maintain him there?

Still, the changeability might be disconcerting to an Aslan.

Now, if you were simply converting these manly men to energy via some form
of advanced technology (i.e., combining them with anti-manly-men in a
Manly-Anti-Manly (MAM) reactor) I think you could argue for a much *higher*
power output. I suspect that the energy gotten from spontaneously
converting a 120 kg sweaty bodybuilder to a 40 kg weakling would be fairly
enormous.

What TL is SayBOOM anyway?

What I would like to know is how many manly-men it would take to row a TL7
wet navy supertanker. You know, like in the motion picture _Waterworld_. ;-)

Assuming high-density room-temperature superconductors, yes.  However, a
compact field small enough for a suit would probably have sufficiently high
field densities that you wouldn\'t want such as suit _anywhere_ near anything
susceptible to magnetic fields.

Well, you strap your manly men into LifeCycle based generators, you
might be able to do it...after all we can fly, ride at ~60 mph, and run
a hydroplane on one Manly-man power...(actually, one skinny euro-bike
man power) It all depends on the powertrain details...rowing is actually

Actually there was a program a couple of weeks ago that showed some
footage taken for a program in the sixties/seventies. It showed an
auction on a farm in minnesota, and it was performed in Norwegian 
(Or at least in something that sounded like norwegian). The man
holding the auction was the son of a norwegian emigrant, and had
never been to Norway, but still it was a much used language in the area.
I guess it still is.

Though you\'re on to something here that could well put the BMF drive to
shame, it\'s certainly going to be a violation of the Traveller Decency
Act, and thus unpublishable (much less canonizationable).  Besides, large
chunks of the list would virulently find it tasteless.

Yeah, you could do it that way, too.

In the CT-MT era, I\'d say TL-D, with a range of up to 2 TL either way.
They ain\'t regular folks.  The MMP Duellists\' Fighter is intended to be
kosher for M:0, though -- hence straight TL-C.

Unfortunately, I don\'t know of/have any design system for doing wet-navy

        Hi, Dave.  IMO, you\'d explode.  All or most of the energy you are
dumping out of your J-Drives to enter J-Space is going to get inhaled by the
Glode and right back into your capacitors.  You\'ll either cause a massive
misjump from not having enough energy actually present to properly open the
way to J-Space, or you\'ll saturate your capacitors.  Either way, you are
dead.  That\'d be my guess, anyway.

IIRC, one "invests" a fixed fortification, which is occupied by the

So does pdf - UNIX, Solaris.... have a look at www.adobe.com. Frankly, the

PDF images from a bitmap program are JPEG compressed IIRC. From a vector
program they are included in the generally bastardised postscript format
that pdf is.

If it\'s enabled, you can cut and paste graphics or text, which isn\'t a
hardship.

So draw your own ;-) Or use a program which reads Acrobat like Illustrator.
Or use the graphics selector and cut and paste it into a bitmap editor.
It\'ll become easier when MacOS X comes out with built in pdf support.

~grumble, grumble, wasn\'t talking about dirty nasty legs...~

Depends in large part on the terrain.  Put that company of paratroopers
in close terrain (say, an urban area, or some wadi-infested parts of
NTC), and that mech infantry task force would have an unpleasant task
ahead.  OTOH, in open terrain, against even marginally competent
treadheads, those paratroopers (dug in or not) would probably be a
hundred or more "Regret to inform you" telegrams waiting to happen.

ObTrav:  As long as wars are fought on planetary surfaces, there will
always be a place on the battlefield for the infantryman walking point
with his rifle.

Won\'t work. The problem with high energy protons is that "heavy"
barriers (metallic hulls, superdense, etc) actually make things *worse*
unless they are a couple of *meters* thick. 

The protons *slam* to a stop in the heavy stuff, and kick up enormous
*showers* of secondary particles. So not only are you trading one
particle for as many as a dozen, but because the secondary particles
are so much slower, they are moving at an ideal velocity to damage
tissues. The raw high energy stuff can zip right thru with minimal
damage (most of the time).

Alas, a field will only *deflect* the particles. The stuff deflercted
from the equator gets *pulled in faster* at the poles. Oops!

And the field strengths required would be distinctly unfriendly to any
electronics nearby. It\'d also tend to nail you to the ship\'s hull. :-)

    'body' => 'We now have two established timelines for the post-1116 period.
In one of them, Emperor Strephon dies, because Archduke Dulinor
felt that it was the only way to force change in the Imperium.
In the other, Archduke Dulinor dies, for reasons unknown - but
somehow, I think someone tipped off the Emperor.

The What If:

Suppose that, rather than planning an assassination, Dulinor
decided to try to start a public (but anonymous) debate on the
merits of the kind of changes he wanted to see, and there was an
implicit invitation to others to participate in the debate.  For
you student of United States history, think of the Federalist and
AntiFederalist Papers.  How might the debate have taken shape?
Might the Emperor have been convinced to consider at least some
of Dulinor\'s ideas?  How would the people of the Imperium have
responded?

The Debate:

OK, the stage is set.  At some point in the not-to-distant
future, Dulinor will be posting some opening comments (although
not under that name, and nobody *knows* that it\'s him).  I\'d like
to see others from this list participate - in persona as a
citizen of the Imperium - in the debate.  If we can build up
enough of an interesting debate, I will do my best to get decent
code written so that Freelance Traveller can have a "Speaker\'s
Corner" where further in-persona debates can occur.  For that to
happen, however, requires _interest_ in the concept, and active
participation in this trial balloon.

Comments on the idea, before His Grace starts writing?

I\'ll give it a try. It might be hard reproducing the redundancy of the
Leviathan using existing GT design rules, though. I might do the first

I saw this (only just getting my copy here in Oz) and agree,

Where on earth did you get the above figure? 

> 350 watts, people do not produce that much power.

Au Contraire. I don\'t think that figure is all that far out of line.
Consider that the heat output of a person in an office or theater is
around 100 watts (standard engineering "rule of thumb" for figuring
heat load on HVAC systems). 

Next check out the power requirements for things like the Gossammer
Albatross and other human powered vehicles. 

Also note that *rowing* is an ineffecient method of coupling human
strength to a drive train. Properly designed *pedals* work much better.
You get to use the much stronger leg muscles. And if you are trying for
maximized output, you can do as a few human powered land vehicles have
done and have the hands "pedalling" as well.

Note that a semi-reclining position allows the best use of leg power.
The pedaller can brace his back agianst the backrest and exert forces
several times *greater* than his body weight (one of the problems with
a standard bike is that the force on the downstroke is limited to your
body weight, using pedals that allow you to "pull" with the other leg
only improve this slightly). 

Arm power will be notably less, but in a well trained athlete the arms
can still exert forces in excess of body weight. 

Luckily, since it\'s electrical power that\'s needed, not direct
mechanical power, you can use some intermediary such that the
individuals can exert maximum effort *without* needing to be
synchronized.

I\'d guess that having their efforts either compress air or "pump"
hydraulic fluid would be the most efficient coupling mechanism. The
pressure could then be used to drive the generator. Much more efficent
than individual generators at each seat.

Ah! I just remembered the applicable formula. W=Fd. 

So, lets see. 200 kilos of "push" = 2000 newtons. Thru a 1/2 meter
"stroke". That\'s 1 kJoule per stroke. At one stroke per second, that\'s
one *kilowatt*. 

Let\'s drop it to a "mere" 100 kilos. That\'s 500 watts. Still more than
the 350 you don\'t believe in, and well within the capacity of anybody
who can pedal a bike uphill at one stroke per second.

Data Point:

In the late 60s the Navy was testing scale model of a sub that "swam"
by sending "waves" along the length of its cylindrical body. Basicly,
the hull had a flexible covering that could be rapidly moved towards or
away from the hull. 

So at the bow, the cover would rise in a circular "hump" that formed a
ring around the hull. By expanding/contracting the right segments in
sequence you got the effect of the "hump" moving smoothly towards the
stern, pushing water along with it. In operation there\'d be several
"humps" moving the length of the hull in synch with each other. 

Performance wasn\'t as good as propellers. On the other hand, it made
*no* noises. Just the thing for lurking around trying to spot enemy
subs before they spotted you.

I\'m sure that scaling it up was impractical. And is probably *still*
impractical. But I can think of a few possible techonologies that might
allow a full size one. It\'d require some *weird* materials though. Some
sort of metal that could change shape on command. Which is also darn
near what you\'d need to have *reliable* "iris" doors. So maybe at later
Imperial tech levels?

It\'s also the standard K\'kree design. At a guess, they can\'t use the
needle/wedge config because even with "parallel" decks, it\'s just too
damn *narrow* for the herd to feel comfortable. 

So, given the need for essentially square or circular decks, they
picked circular and use "two" decks in a saucer. The "living" deck, and
a "machinery" deck. The machinery deck is visited mostly by repair
robots.

However, it\'s canon that Traveller starships exist and that crews don\'t die
every time they jump into a system that happens to be having a flare. 
There must exist some semi-magical TL-10 or so radiation shielding material;
it\'s a technological necessity.

Well, for one thing, 195 tons is *nothing*. At your "10% purity" and
assuming the "average" density of 4 for "stony" material (ie "rock"),
you started out with an "asteroid" that was all of 10 meters in diameter!

Also, ore-forming processes tend to require both lots of water and a
fair amount of gravity. Asteroids are going to be one *very* roughly
differentiated into the four types/layers:

1. Icy (frozen water, ammonia, methane, and the like). Only found in
   outer system or in *big* bodies (large moons/small planets)

2. Chondritic. What gets left behind after an icy body is exposed to
   heat and stellar UV for a while. Lots of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
   and nitrogen compounds (CHON). Sort of a black tarry mess to a sort
   of charcoal. *Very* black.

3. Stony. Silicates, with lots of aluminum, magnesium, titanium and
   other "siderophilic" elements. Your basic "country rock", sort of
   like basalt. Also lots of calcium, potasium, sodium, etc.

4. Nickel-iron. This is what was left over after all the more active
   elements glommed onto oxygen, chlorine and what-have-you.

As the system formed, bodies were "dirty snowballs", a random mixture of
ices and dust grains. There were lots of short-lived radioisotopes
present, so the larger bodies (say anything more than a few 100 meters)
melted on the inside. The dust grains sank to the center, and since
they were the primary source of the heat, they melted too. That formed
the "stony" material as the various components of the "dust" reacted
both with the liquified "ice" and with each other. And the stuff that
didn\'t react got left to sink to the center, forming the nickel-iron. 

Thus you get bodies that are ice-stone-iron as you move inwards. In the
areas closer to the new star the ice boils away at least partly, and
you get CHON material.

As time went on, these bodies cooled, while at the same time they
collided with each other. Big ones got bigger, small one got broken
apart. And the boundaries between layers would be weak points. 

So the asteroids are made up of chunks of the various layers. The
largest might even be stone over an intact iron core. Most of the rest
are likely to be just a single "layer". 

Refining depends a *lot* on which kind of material you are processing. 

Ice is VALUABLE. Not only does it have hydrogen for fuel, it also has
oxygen for air, and nitrogen, which is needed to grow food! The carbon
doesn\'t hurt either. 

Refining consists of melting the ice, and "distilling" it. You wind up
with water, ammonia, and methane, plus small amounts of other
compounds.

Ammonia is a damn good starting place for making fertilizer and
explosives, so it would likely be sold as such unless you needed fuel
badly! of hydrogen. In that case, you\'d crack it to nitrogen and
hydrogen and carry the nitrogen as LN2.

Water is easier to haul as water, and nice to have. And ice is easy to
handle. 

Methane is also easier to transport as itself. And it\'s a good starting
point for synthesizing various hydrocarbons (think oils and plastics).

The leftover sludge is worth something too, but it\'s not worth refining
on board. You\'d sell it to an outfit that buys it and refines out the
valuable parts, likely the same folks who buy CHON. The exception might
be if you find some undifferentiated "dirty snowballs", then you\'d
filter out the dust grains before distilling the ices. The dust grains
aren\'t likely to be all the useful. So you might dump them, or since
they *do* have some trace elements, you might dump the few kilos of
dust into your "garden" plot.

Cnondrites are a *mess* to refine. Not worth the trouble of doing it on
ship. But they are pretty valuable as is. You\'d likely grind them up,
and seperate out any rocky bits. The ground CHON goes in the hold, and
gets sold the processors back at base. It\'s valuable as a starting
point for a lot of chemical synthesis processes, and because of the
high nitrogen content.

Nickel-iron can be refined. Though it\'s tempting to just leave it
"as-is" and drag it to a big smelter. It\'s not that valuable. The
valuable stuff might be what\'s leftover *after* you extract the nickel
and iron. But a ship can\'t make a profit on that unless you get lucky
and hit a body that\'s high in the "other" stuff. Most nickel-iron
bodies get a few sample taken to see if they might be "rich" in
something, and if they aren\'t, they get a beacon hung on them. When
they get "close" to one of the big smelters, they\'ll send out a tug and
make you an offer. Usually you\'ll take it. Your beacon gets shipped
back to your base.

Stony bodies are problematic. They are where most of the "good"
elements are found. But at the same time, the good stuff is spread
pretty thinly. There\'s nothing to *concentrate* it they way processes
on planets do. So it\'s sort of like mining seawater. Sure, there\'s lots
of good stuff in there, but you have to process so much *junk* to get
to it. 

Still, there are *some* variations in composition. A rock might be
richer than normal in things like calcium or sodium. That might make it
worthwhile. 

But for the most part, stony bodies rarely even get tagged. Folks use
them to erect shelters on, and dig into them to make bases. And big
operators will mine them to produce silicon, aluminum, magnesium,
titanium, etc. Most of the silicon will get reacted wil the oxygen
produced while liberating the metals. This will form various quartz or
glass materials.

Standard *cheap* construction in the belt uses sandwich panels of
aluminum with a quartz & vacuum honycomb in the middle. Insulates ok,
soundproofs fairly well, is light. It\'d get used for non-loadbearing
panels. Loadbearing stuff is likely to be steel.

The "leftovers" from the first stage of processing stony bodies will
get processed for other things. I don\'t have an elemental abundance
table handy, so I can\'t say which would get gone for first.

I am not sure what she meant about a \'General\' attack.  You should ask 
her [Julie Garth].  You can respond to her at 
http://townhall.webrpg.com/ and just follow the links under roleplaying 
games | science fiction | science fiction games (general).  Her post was 
titled: <IMPORTANT> All RPG PLAYERS   Julie Garth   01/27/1999 10:47

Were there other episodes?  I don\'t know.  Ask her; I don\'t watch the 
show.
Did other shows advance this stereo type?  There were a few shows and 
movies that put forth a very negative view of role-playing games.  The 
only one I can recall off hand is Monsters & Mazes.  In that movie Tom 
Hanks (I think) played a character that was into role-playing and ended 
up losing touch with reality because of the game.  The movie ended, as 
far as I can remember, with him playing with his friends one last time 
while he was at the funny farm.

With all of the talk about GMs being gods and worshiped by their players 
it reminded me of this post.

You could make a case for the lower tech levels, but I would wonder why you
would give away one of the biggest advantages the Imperium has over any of
its neighbors: better technology?

IMTU, the lower tech, 13-, is usually for planetary navies, unless the
planet is of a higher tech level.  TL-14 and 15 are for the reserves, and
TL 15+ is mainline forces.

The Susquehannas are as much a propoganda tool as they are a military tool.

Using the following ballpark figures :-
Supertanker : 555800 tonnes dwt : 400m long, beam 63m, draught 28.5m ;
speed 16kn (28km/h). Cargo fraction 25% of gross mass.

We\'re looking at a minimum vehicle mass of about 300000 tonnes.

To get a top speed of 2 m/sec, we need
(0.9 X sqrt[0.9 X 50000]) kW using Terry McInne\'s modification of the
Brunel equation given a typical deep displacement hull.

This is approximately 191kW.

Given a baseline power output for rowers of 35W per 70kg rower, + 7W for
each point of strength or endurance over 7, so manly men (?min
Str=End=10?) have an average power out of 77W.

We need somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2480 \'Manly Men\'.

You can design your cargo area as close to the ground as you want with any
deck orientation. Any configuration can be designed with and deck
orientation; parallel deck designs have no advantage and perpendicular
decks have no disadvantage.

Perpendicular deck ships can use any configuration including needle/wedge;
the design rules are the same for any deck orientation. A needle/wedge
configuration can be designed with perpendicular decks along the long axis
if required.

This is the assertion that set off the flamewar. Tall, narrow structures
are not necessarily more vulnerable to high winds, tremors, uneven ground,
et al than any other sort of structure. Skyscrapers have survived
earthquakes, bombings, hurricanes, soil liquefaction, and airplanes
crashing into them without toppling while short, squat, structures in the
same situation have collapsed. I realize there are many people who are
utterly unable to accept this, to those I can only suggest an introductory
engineering statics book.

It is not true that "long and narrow" configurations favor parallel deck
design; the design rules are the same in either case.

Airplanes are designed with parallel decks to reduce wind resistance and
because it\'s more efficient to build wings parallel to the ship body. I
concede that bodies incapable of over 1 G of acceleration and which require
wings for lift are more efficient with parallel decks. Traveller starships
are not.

Again, deck orientation has *no effect* on the ship configuration; you can
make any shape with either parallel or perpendicular decks.

A perpendicular-deck ship without artificial gravity can safely maneuver at
1 G. A parallel-deck ship without artificial gravity can arguably
accelerate at a fraction of a G, though frankly it is unsafe at any speed.

Or, alternatively, more inertial compensation for the same money.

To be fair, perpendicular orientation ships have no advantage here. Surface
area is a function of configuration, and deck orientation has no
correlation with configuration.

You forgot:

6. They are faster. In every version of Traveller there is a limit to the
amount of inertial compensation technically possible. Ships with parallel
decks must devote at least as many Gs of inertial compensation as
acceleration plus one more to provide artificial gravity. Perpendicular
decks need only to compensate 1 G less than maximum acceleration. This
means a ship with perpendicular decks can operate at 2 Gs more acceleration
than an identical design with parallel decks.

This is the assertion that set off the flamewar. Tall, narrow structures
are not necessarily more vulnerable to high winds, tremors, uneven ground,
et al than any other sort of structure. Skyscrapers have survived
earthquakes, bombings, hurricanes, soil liquefaction, and airplanes
crashing into them without toppling while short, squat, structures in the
same situation have collapsed. I realize there are many people who are
utterly unable to accept this, to those I can only suggest an introductory
engineering statics book.

It is not true that "long and narrow" configurations favor parallel deck
design; the design rules are the same in either case.

Airplanes are designed with parallel decks to reduce wind resistance and
because it\'s more efficient to build wings parallel to the ship body. I
concede that bodies incapable of over 1 G of acceleration and which require
wings for lift are more efficient with parallel decks. Traveller starships
are not.

Again, deck orientation has *no effect* on the ship configuration; you can
make any shape with either parallel or perpendicular decks.

A perpendicular-deck ship without artificial gravity can safely maneuver at
1 G. A parallel-deck ship without artificial gravity can arguably
accelerate at a fraction of a G, though frankly it is unsafe at any speed.

Or, alternatively, more inertial compensation for the same money.

To be fair, perpendicular orientation ships have no advantage here. Surface
area is a function of configuration, and deck orientation has no
correlation with configuration.

You forgot:

6. They are faster. In every version of Traveller there is a limit to the
amount of inertial compensation technically possible. Ships with parallel
decks must devote at least as many Gs of inertial compensation as
acceleration plus one more to provide artificial gravity. Perpendicular
decks need only to compensate 1 G less than maximum acceleration. This
means a ship with perpendicular decks can operate at 2 Gs more acceleration
than an identical design with parallel decks.

I used it twice. Once to teach a player a lesson about considering 
himself invincible. The second seemed the only choice left.  The player 
fired his weapon and scored a critical success against an NPC. The young 
and nervous crewman (NPC) was behind a small armorglass viewport of a 
merchant vessel\'s belly turret, and the ship was parked on a dirtside 
tarmac. The shell was a 10mm customized HEAP round and it actually 
damaged the surface of the viewport. The young human male NPC made a 
reaction check, failed it (in favor of aggresion), and promptly returned 
fire with the turret\'s only weapon, a sandcaster...

My players still laugh about that encounter...

I saw that episode and laughed my butt off. I\'ve actually met gamers 
like that, and had a similar reaction.  I have yet to see a sit-com say 
anything positive about gaming, but then again, I remember that most of 
those shows are geared towards a 10th grade education on average.

I figure most of the gamers I know would be more offended by the general 
low quality of television in general...

I\'m telling Garrison Keillor about this.  And I would recommend reading

about:

*	"Salad" and its uses

Of course, this does have its uses in Traveller.  If nothing else, all
those glaciated planets needs cultures to go with them - this is an
excellent sourcebook!

We could easily calculate the number of Str C  End C individuals at age
12 as (1/36 x 1/36) = 1/1,296.  We know that Syleas Millieu 0 population
was 30 something billion.  If we arbitrarily assume it was 35 billion
and that half of these were male our male population should be 17.5
billion.  [In reality Str C End C individuals are more likely to be male
then female but not in Traveller so we will ignore that data.] The
question then becomes one of what percentages of these men will then
enter careers where they can gain +3 Str & +3 End.  Milliue 0 charecters
should be generated with T4 & they will therefore be earing 5 advanced
every 4 years.  If all these advances go to Str & End then the youngest
Str F End F men will be age 23.  We next need to determine by what age
their aging losses will be enough greater than their skill & stat gains
so as to ensure that they are no longer Str 15 End 15 arbitrarily we
will call that  age 50.  Therefore the group of potential Str F End F
men is a 27 year wide age cohort.  To make opur population model easier
we will assume that _all_ male individuals live to the age of 81 years
when they _all_  die.  Therefore the 23-50 group will be 1/3 of the
total males or 5.833 etc billion.  4,2501,028 of these men will have
been Str C End C at age 18.  If (arbitrarily) 1 in 500 of these men work
up to Str F & End F then we will have 9,002 very many men.  Now we have
to teach them all Small Watercraft 5.

If your model for M:0 Cleon owes a bit two much to Ludwig of Bavaria &
you substitute [fascination for crew rowers] for [fascination with tall
cavalrymen] you may be able to envision these men being gathered up.  It
does not seem all that likely to me although the notion of Cleon being
as mad as Ludwig is amusing.

How about if you changed the power for the gun from thee manly men
directly to a battery.  The manly men then power up & recharge the
capacitors through their rowing.  Thus you can ignore all that minimum
ROF rot because if your power supply (manly men) has not recharged your
batteries then you can\'t fire the weapon.

If this was a GURPS Traveller design we could use a soulburner engine
that would get its power from sucking the life force out of the rowers &
killing them.  GURPS Vehicles 2nd ed says (pg 86) that the victim of a
soulburner loses 1 HT/hour for every 10 kW of power provided.  Since
this craft need 1.55 MW it need 155 HT per hour.  If our manly men are
HT 15 then we will have to kill 10 & 1/3 of them per hour. 

I have just suggested using soulburners in Traveller, sometimes I think
that GURPS may be too universal....

For the cost of one M2, you can buy a *lot* of BMP-2s. Probably three, plus

In my opinion, this tendency brings into question the whole point of IFVs.
If they are too vulnerable to fight in, and too expensive to leave in
reserve, what do you do with them ?

Hopefully, this cost savings resulted in someone else being adequately
equipped and had enough in the field training to do their job, rather than
have an army which compromised these things to afford a bunch of M2s.

	Actually, that\'s EXACTLY the biggest complaint about the Bradley.
There\'s a difference between a "personnel carrier" and a "fighting
vehicle." Unfortunately, someone who doesn\'t understand the
difference and is only used to PCs will of course consider a FV to be
poorly designed. 

	To make things worse, BOTH factions had a hand in designing the
Bradley. Both kept arguing back & forth and changing the
requirements, meddling with the design, etc. 

	In Traveller terms, think of it this way: a PC is a battle rider
carrier: it takes the fighting craft to the area, and then stays out
of the way. A FV is a carrier which is intended to support the battle
riders. But if you\'ve got both types of admirals involved in the
design, you\'ll wind up with one that can\'t carry enough riders to
stand up against a regular carrier\'s task force, and it\'s not well
armed/armored to hold its own ...

The 70kg mass for the average human is given in the MT Wet Navy design
sequences I am quoting from.  Obviously our manly men bodybuilders would
mass more than this on average but the design sequence I was using gave
this as the standard.

The T4 CSC design sequence Kenji was using seemed to refer to total m^3
of people & did not seem to be including space for them to work in.

I used the approximate simplifying assumption that people are about the
same density as water (usually somewhat less of course).  Therefore 1m^3
of people would be 1000 kg of people 1,000/70 = approximately 14.286.

That seems mathematically right to me & I defer to your superior
scientific knowledge but it seems high.  

My favorite reference book [The Addison Wesley Science Handbook Ed
Cloeman & Dewar, Addsion Wesley, ISBN 0-201-76652-3 (c) 1997 $18.00 US -
shameless plug] says that 1 kilowatt hour equals 3,412 BTU / 3.6 x 10^13
ergs / 85,294,000 foot pounds / 1.341  (nonmetric) horsepower hour /
3,600,00 joules / 860 kilocalories(food calories) / 367,099 kg force
meters  

Can a human being really generate a sustained 0.5 kilowatt?  That would
be equal to 42 million foot pounds or 0.65 horsepower.  What do the real
world data indicate?

I knew that the 35 watts/hour base that the MT Wet Navy design sequence
gave was low but is it really that low?

According to Traveller\'s Digest # 16 TL 14 bonded superdense is 100x
better than concrete or rock, 33x better than steel, and 7x better than
lead at radiation protection (33 cm of steel stop as much radiation as 1
cm of bonded superdense). 

The figure for ordinary TL 12 superdense is 43x better than concrete or 
rock, 14x better than steel, and 3x better than lead.

Basically, a TL 14 ship with a 1 cm thick hull (not an unreasonable
figure) has the same protection protection from radiation as one with a
hull made from 1 meter of solid rock.  That\'s a goodly amount of radiation
protection in my book. 

According to the same article vacc suits do not usefully protect against
radiation even TL 14 vacc suits only reduce the exposure by a factor of
0.7.  However TL 12 combat armor or battle dress halves radiation exposure
and the TL 14 equivalents reduce exposure by a factor of 10.  Basically,
those are the things to wear if you are going outside during a flare.

I agree that a ships physical capabilities should be closely matched to 
the games reality (i.e. the design, economics & combat rules). This is 
usually not the case, and indeed many ships don\'t even comply with their 
own games design rules.

However on the operational & manning side...

Pauses for a moment, takes lid of old can of worms...

Would you be happy to see totally automated ships requiring only a 
handful, one or zero crew? 

This depends on where you stand on the automation level allowed in 
traveller ships, and which Gurps automation rules you want to 
incorporate. Automation equals optimization equals increased 
price/performance (usually). The software and robots cost more, but you 
don\'t waste all that space and money on "optional extras" like 
staterooms, life-support, sickbays and provisions. So you end up with 
more compact ships, and less wages and operating costs to pay. 

In G:T you can use gunner programs to replace living gunners.
I already use this in my designs to :
- - eliminate the need for living gunners from commercial ships and 
non-combat military ships
- - provide 24 hour gunner backup to military combat ships

Commercially this is justified by reduced crew and crew overheads and 
reduced insurance premiums (i.e. a software gunner satisfies your 
insurance stipulated minimum rated gunner requirements).

If you use Gurps Ultra Tech/Robots/Space computer rules, even with the 
G:T proposed limitations, you could probably replace most of the crew 
with software and/or robots. It is cost and space effective. They are 
also technologically likely / inevitable.

Why would the military have any qualms about total automation? and the 
commercial case is just as strong.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
In my Classic Traveller campaign, robots and expert-system computers
existed, but were deliberately limited by social and legal factors. It was
specifically illegal in my Imperium to place lethal force in the hands of a
robot. Furthermore, it was illegal to have robots that exceeded a certain
level of autonomy. You could have a robot fly a grav truck, but it would
have to have a human pilot who could take over operations on board.

Part of this was mistrust of robots (caused by some highly-publicized
incidents with early self-motivated robots), part was the labor force\'s fear
of replacement, part was the anti-Zhodani propaganda (insert vids of
soulless Zho killer warbots performing atrocities here).

This was a design decision on my part, as I didn\'t want my Traveller
campaign to be too Star Wars-ish...I already had starport cantinas full of
oddball aliens, I didn\'t want friendly droids around every corner as well.

Robots were used in factories and other highly-controlled environments
(such as the robots at Research Station Gamma, and yes the Imperium
could use lethal force robots at a secret installation), and might be seen
as stationary or semi-mobile expert systems (the Trader and Broker
robots mentioned in Merchant Prince), but you wouldn\'t see them in 
most occupations - it would be strange on most worlds to bump into
a robot on the street.

I\'ve watched that movie a time or two.  At first I thiught it was a shot at
RPGs also but after watching I began to have my doughts.  The main character
had some serious problems that were not game related.  He excaped into the
game to get away from his problem and also to try to \'solve\' them.  If
memory serves he was searching for \'the Great Hall\' which I think was his
dead older brother.  It was the death of \'the Great Hall\' that drove him
over the edge.

At the end he was not in an asilem but at his home.  He thought it was an
Inn and that he payed for his lodging with a magic coin that somehow
reapeared on his night stand every morning.  His mother put it there and was
the \'kindly inn keeper\'.  That he did not recognizer her as his mother
bothered her greatly.  The group \'played the game\' one last time before
going on with their real lives.  Only the main character could \'see it\'
though and they did it as a good bye.  It was strongly implied that he
stayed in his own \'reality\' for the rest of his life.  The narrarater,
another player in the group, was not to sure if that was a good thing or a
bad one.

This is of course as best as I can recall.  (It\'s been 10 years sence I last
saw the movie.)  While \'the game\' was an important piece of the movie it was
the main charater\'s own real life that was to terible for him to face.  I do
not recall exactly what about it was so bad.  His \'lifes story\' was \'hidden\'
in the adventure/quest he had written for the game and was very allagorical.
His friends had to \'play the game\' to unravel his \'quest\' which ended up
being a quest for his dead brother that could only be \'solved\' by the death
of the main character.  They saved him at the last minute (of course) but
when he woke up he was lost to the real world that was to much for him to
deal with.  In \'his world\' he was safe form the pain of his life.

Yes, the movie Mazes & Monsters takes some real shots at roleplaying games
in general (and more specifically a poorly disguised Dungeons & Dragons). It
brings in subtle "cult" ties, in one scene where the games is actually
played, there\'s a certain amount of monotone group chanting for example.

The end consensus among all characters was that playing the game was not
healthy. In the book the movie was based on, this is far more apparent. Rona
Jaffe, the author, tells the story "impartially," and at the end gives us a
sort of pat twist: She was one of the players of the game. There\'s much
railing at the game by all participants, and they all come to the conclusion
that love and friendship are more important than the game.

Mazes & Monsters (the game in the movie) was also portrayed something like a
"drug." All of the characters had some problem in their lives that caused
them to *turn to* the game in the first place.

The movie was a highly fictionalized account of Dallas Eggbert III\'s real
life story, which actually had nothing to do with D&D other than the fact
that he played it and the game was relatively new when he initially
disappeared. If you do a search for the guy\'s story on the web, you\'ll find
it.

You might want to look at that engineering book again,
Richard...Skyscrapers have an enormously significant difference from a
tall starship standing on the ground: foundations, sometimes hundreds of
feet deep. THAT is what anchors a skyscraper, and would make for some
really unwieldy landing gear on a starship.

Simple example: stand an 8 foot 4x4 on the ground, end up. This is a
starship. Next to it, stick a 10 foot 4x4 into a 2 ft deep posthole,
packed in with dirt. This is a skyscraper. Both are equal heights above
the ground. Push on both.

Which one falls over?

Oh why did the X-Files theme just start playing in my head...? 

Sort of like the metal from the alleged Roswell crash? Wonder how many
mini-subs we have skulking about on this principle. You can hide an
_awful_ lot of goodies in a defense budget, for, saaaay a new class of
submarine...especially when the budget goes into overruns...:-)

weall, ummm, errr, Uhhh..Nurnies, yep, that\'s what, they\'re Nurnies. 

(for those not into SFX jargon, nurnies are the little details stuck all
over, for instance, the surface of the death star model to make it look

On reflection....

What I was thinking, since Traveller starship lasers are X-ray, they
wouldn\'t necessarily use lenses, but solid state emitters (big honking
diode lasers) and those are what the little things inside the hexagons
are. The honeycomb is the support for the gravitic projectors that shape
and aim the beam, which is actually an array of phase-aligned beams. The
big disk keeps dust off of the laser when it\'s inside the
starship...Yeah, that\'s the ticket!

One question, it looks as if the flight deack has a control panel area

    'body' => 'Ah, I see that I\'ve opened up an old debate.  I thought I remembered
discussion on this a while back, but I don\'t remember it being a flamewar.
Mind you, I tend to skip messages with too many !!!s and CAPS. :-)

First, let me say thanks to those who replied, especially he who sent in
the summary of the arguments.  (Sorry, I\'m too lazy to go back and check).

Now I\'m going to make some of my own arguments/counterarguments and I\'d
like your reactions. Keep your hats on people, it\'s only a game! (and if
it was completely realistic, it would be boring as all hell!)

<Richard>
Your summary of the arguments are accurate. However, you don\'t mention
that the arguments in favor of parallel decks are fallacious. 
</Richard>

Ah, I love the tact on this list! :-)  "There are of course two sides to
this argument, but one of them is dumb."

<Richard>
>FOR PARALLEL DECKS:
>
>1.  More efficient dirtside cargo handling.  Parallel deck designs can

>deck designs.

You can design your cargo area as close to the ground as you want with any
deck orientation. Any configuration can be designed with and deck
orientation; parallel deck designs have no advantage and perpendicular
decks have no disadvantage.
</Richard>

I\'m not sure I understand this.  If you\'ve got a needle with perpendicular
decks, how do you get lots of deckspace close to the ground?  By putting
the thrust perpendicular to the long axis?  Hmm, I suppose this is
possible, but it just seems a little odd to me.  You\'d have a hard time
presenting minimum aspect to an enemy like this, which I thought was the
major advantage of a needle design.

<Richard>
Perpendicular deck ships can use any configuration including needle/wedge;
the design rules are the same for any deck orientation. A needle/wedge
configuration can be designed with perpendicular decks along the long axis
if required.
</Richard>

Ah, so you are talking about thrust perp to the long axis.  I\'ve always
thought the resistance of needles to meson gun fire involved their ability
to present minimum aspect to the enemy.  If the needle has to go sidelong
when approaching or retreating, this is hard to do.

<Richard>
This is the assertion that set off the flamewar. Tall, narrow structures
are not necessarily more vulnerable to high winds, tremors, uneven ground,
et al than any other sort of structure. Skyscrapers have survived
earthquakes, bombings, hurricanes, soil liquefaction, and airplanes
crashing into them without toppling while short, squat, structures in the
same situation have collapsed. I realize there are many people who are
utterly unable to accept this, to those I can only suggest an introductory
engineering statics book.
</Richard>

Hmm, okay, I\'m going to try to be very diplomatic here, as I don\'t want to
re-ignite any passions (I can\'t believe I\'m walking on eggshells regarding
fictional starships in the 57th century!  You\'d expect this on the MEPML
(Middle East Politics Mailing List) :-).  It seems to me that a tall thin
structure would be inately more vulnerable to toppling, simply as a matter
of balance (e.g., the Delta clipper toppled catastrophically).  But given
the existence of grav drives and high-power computers, I don\'t see this as
a problem. Is that basically your position?  Or are you arguing that it\'s
not more difficult to engineer a stable tall structure than a stable short
one?

<Richard>
It is not true that "long and narrow" configurations favor parallel deck
design; the design rules are the same in either case.
</Richard>

They do if you need single large rooms for any reason, or if you want to
minimize the need for up/down movement to get from place to place on a
ship, which is good ergonomics.  That is, unless you\'re talking about
putting thrust perp to the long axis... 

<Richard>
[snipped argument about coolness and aesthetics for yachts]
Again, deck orientation has *no effect* on the ship configuration; you can
make any shape with either parallel or perpendicular decks.
</Richard>

True, but a needle with the thrust going perp to the long axis is just not
as cool, so I\'d agree with this argument for ship designs with aesthetic
considerations.

As for the arguments about safety and maneuvering without anti-grav, this
only becomes a consideration if anti-grav is unreliable.  Those wishing
for parallel decks ITTU can simply make anti-grav reliable and
highly-efficient (i.e., requiring negligible power).  In any case, it
should be a simple matter to have a cut-off of thruster power in the case
of loss of gravity control (this would be necessary even if the decks were
perp to thrust, since attitude maneuvers would still throw the crew around
when the wall compensators failed). 

The argument that perp decks allow faster accel only comes in if you
assume the limit to accel of a ship is based on inertial compensation
limits.  It may just as easily be from limits on the drives themselves. 
In fact, this seems more likely to me, since even if ships could only have
6g of inertial compensation, they should be able to go up to much higher
accelerations (assuming the crew can handle a few g, which should be the
case for fighter pilots at the very least).  

One thing that I think needs to be considered is the probability of the
gravitic system failing and the times at which this would happen.  First,
I see the system as a highly distributed thing which I doubt would fail to
any large extent unless the ship was being torn to bits.  Isolated grav
plates might fail, making certain areas dangerous, but the whole system
failing and requiring people to "walk on walls" seems unlikely to happen
before the drives are toast anyway. The most likely scenario I could see
would have this occurring during combat, at which point everyone\'s in acc
couches anyway.  If they\'re in a ship with parallel decks, this actually
puts them in a good position to take the forces, as their backs will be
towards the thrusters.

In a civilian ship, a sudden overall failure would happen very rarely, and
would simply require the drives to be cut until the problem was fixed.  Of
course, there are hazzards from suddenly cutting the drives, but I think
this would happen rarely enough that people wouldn\'t worry about it.

Like I said, keep your hats on.  I\'m willing to be convinced I\'m wrong by
good arguments, not rants...

Thanks,
Charles.

Noted; however, this is a special-purpose vessel for which, in my

Again, I believe this would render the craft considerably less than
desireable to the end-users.  Perhaps an optimized, combat-capable version
(e.g., the Manly Man Merc Cruiser, aka The Happy Fun Pec) would
take advantage of this fact.

Okay -- thanks for the technical information on this.  In the redesign, I
think I\'ll make the manly man power output something like 400 watts as a
compromise between rowing and maximal efficiency.

Okay, enough to crew about three of the new, redesigned Manly Man Powered

Considering that his son (IIRC), Cleon the Mad, lived up to the name, I
think a reasonable case can be made for Cleon I to have had some slight
socially-acceptable-rationality deficit.

Your crass materialistic bourgeois predilections for soulless
efficiency betray you.  The esteemed customer -- and any gentleman of
taste and breeding, one might add -- would certainly not find this
solution optimal.

[Note: The fact that SayBOOM can safely be presumed to have as its
ultimate goal the full enablement of the transcendence of the Imperial
aristocratic-bourgeoise society and its manifestation as a corporate
police state, is merely coincidental, and is certainly not reflected in
the design of this vessel.]

Yes.  

If not locked into these particular design parameters, FS would power the
vessel by a teacup black hole collider, staffed by its cranked-up juvenile
family members.  SayBOOM would power it with batteries and staff it with
telepathic slugs and high school students working for extra credit.  And
hoping to score off the FS kids while they\'re out there.

In addition:

While higher and higher levels of automation can decrease operating
costs (once the technology for a given level of automation is matured
past bleeding-edge), this really only applies to routine operations.  In
combat, when things break, live humans would still, IMHO, have the edge
in repairing them under battle conditions (and in devising improvised
work-arounds if repair is impossible).  Automated systems tend to work
best when specialized to the task at hand.  Humans, OTOH, are anything
_but_ specialized.  An astrogator can more easily be trained to repel
boarding parties than a navcomp.

Yes, but there was other source material that defined his ideas a
little better.  Not a whole lot better; there was plenty of
wiggle room and room for interpretation, but certainly enough for
ideas to get thrown around in debate.  And that could be
considered part of Dulinor\'s genius; the ideas that are discussed
in the debate can give him an idea of what the people of the
Imperium, in whose name he is putatively advocating, really do
want from their Imperium.

That could be a way of describing my interpretation of the
available material on Dulinor\'s views - but rather than
discussing it this way, why not save it for the debate?  Dulinor
(or his alter-ego, or the anonymous name espousing his views, or
Jeff Zeitlin) does not claim the exclusive right to post for that
viewpoint.  The first post will simply be stating _my_
interpretation of his views; and the only reason that I
"attribute" them to Dulinor (anonymously) is because I think
that\'s the best way to start the debate - but maybe it\'s not
Dulinor at all, but someone close to him who knows his views?

Actually, Cleon\'s son was Cleon II \'the Weak\', meaning that he was not
good at palace intrigue.

Cleon the Mad was several generations later and had a tenuous (at best)
genetic link to the original Cleon to go with his tenuous grasp on
reality.

Dulinor\'s ideology is irrelevant to the debate - recall that,
officially, nobody knows whether Dulinor is even participating.
Everyone that participates will do so as an Imperial citizen,
and, beyond that, will decide whether to do so under their real
name, or under a nom-de-plume.  I would expect, if this debate
were "real", that perhaps some of the other notable nobles would
participate, as would respected academics, business leaders, and
so on.  Again, think of the Federalist/AntiFederalist debate.
While the specific ideas involved are different, the purpose is
essentially the same.

(This doesn\'t mean that an ordinary citizen couldn\'t participate,
although Joe Blow\'s views might not get as wide circulation - in
reality, such a debate would spin off many smaller debates, which
is where the Joe Blows would participate.  Participants in _this_
debate should take one of the "high-visibility" positions above -
although there is no need to reveal the specific position.  But,
it might very well become clear over time; you are expected to
write from the point of view of your chosen persona - the
academic should not write as though he were a business leader,
although he may know about business.)

Note that I would recommend using a nom-de-plume, on the basis
that if a well-known person were to participate in the debate
under his/her own name, others might be influenced because of the
person, rather than because of the points made in the essay.
This is, in fact, why participants on both sides used obvious
noms-de-plume in the Federalist/AntiFederalist debates.

There are lots more than that :(

How about the Shivva Class Patrol Frigate: DR of only 50, 10 staterooms 
in text - yet deckplan shows 18 and most of them are oversize, plus the 
amount of deckplan room allocated for that 24 spaces jump drive is just 
phenomenal. And even if you use the low numbers in the text the design 
doesn\'t fit in the space available. It is almost bearable with major 
tweaks (e.g. 18 staterooms, DR 250, lower G rating to 1.5, move 15 DT of 
reserve fuel to the fuel skimmer). But I shouldn\'t have to tweak it.

Unfortunately the same is true for many of the ships published for all 
systems.

I like ships, they add a lot of flavour to the game. I also like them to 
be consistent and well designed.  However, whenever I do a design check 
on a published ship I am usually disappointed.

So I suppose this is another reason to support products with program 
validated designs like 101 Starships from BITS. Now if they could just 
do version 2 with 101 deckplans...

Aside: note that in the Yetsabl Zhodani Courier the single turret has 
two laser mounts and one sandcaster mount - making mixed ordnance 
turrets a valid design.

freighters ( I love the through deck design of the fat trader\'s cargo deck,
and I like Ro-Ro and LASH cargo handling...). I also think that it\'s clumsy as
hell to load the APC\'s from the cargo deck of the happy fun ball (I love this
nickname for the mercenary cruiser!). It reminds me of watching TL 8
astronauts getting into the Apollo Command module....Perhaps I\'m being too
rigid, but I go with the rule of thumb, that if you are handling cargo in
atmosphere, go parallel, else go perpendicular...

That\'s cool under HG and CT book 2. If a ship has 10 or less hardpoints
(meaning <=1000 displacement tons in practical terms...) she can have mixed
turret weapons. Each weapon type is then a seperate battery (but the rules
never made this clear if it meant that you could have multiple gunners per
turret, or the gunner could only fire one type of weapon per turn..). Don\'t

Depends what platform you\'re on.

On Unix you use the command    "tar -xf tml-v1998-n150-n159.tar.Z" or
someting similar

( tar stands for Tape ARchive, it\'s an old unix utility for compresed

So use robot bodies. They don\'t require any provisions except power. 
They don\'t need any quarters. They don\'t need oxygen.

How much of that damage control is to keep the ship capable of 
supporting living beings?

Would non-breathing robots be better at damage control in a damaged 
spaceship?

If you keep your ship in vacuum or inert gas atmosphere, where possible, 
you don\'t worry about fires too much.

Would you rather have one robot at peak efficiency 99% of the time, or 
one living crew member at peak efficiency 33% of the time?

You mean like launching a cruise missile and trusting it not to kill 
you. You already do!

Would you rather them be in the hands of your average PC?

I wouldn\'t want to let them be totally crewless either. But you can do 
them with a lot less crew than at present.

I have no problems with anyones TU rationale. If all ships were fully

out consequences of designing for maximum optimisation (the original 
post).

Some years back, I read a post suggesting that the two most fail-safe
systems on a Federation starship are the artificial gravity and the
bridge camera.  If either of those cut out, it\'s a sure bet that the
entire ship will explode moments later.

Now try this: 

1. Set up a tall thin box, say something like a refrigerator box. Try
   tipping it over.

2. Next, place some concrete blocks in the bottom. Try tipping it over.

3. Somehow, fasten the concrete blocks inside at the *top*. Try tipping
   it over.

4. Distribute the weight of the blocks equally thru the box. Try
   tipping it over. 

You\'ll find that #1 tips easily. #4 is harder. #3 almost falls over on
its own. And #2 is hardest.

What matters is *mass distribution*, and *total mass*. 

For example, consider the Washington Monument. Or an Egyptian obelisk.
They both are merely *sitting* on their foundations. They are in no
danger of tipping over. Really!

You are also *assuming* that the parallel and perpendicular designs
have the same hull shape. 

And unless the enemy is in the direction that you are boosting, the
needle with thrust perpendicular to the long axis will have *no*
trouble presenting the "point" to the enemy.

Not really. Running *directly* away from an enemy is not always
practical *or* wise. Remember that space is three dimensional. A skew
course can be far more effective than one that stays in the same plane
as far as avoiding engagement is concerned.

The Delta-X toppled *after a major landing gear failure*. The Eifel

Actually, it\'s *not* hard to make a tall structure stable unless you
are dealing with someing as grotesquely elongated as a radio station\'s
antenna mast. 

Buildings *don\'t* fall over.

Sure, but you *can\'t* design a ship that\'s big enough that folks needs
to walk around in it during flight *and* have more than 2gs of accel in
excess of compensation. 

At 2gs you can walk if you are both strong and careful. But it is not
recommended. At anything higher, forget it.

In a fighter the considerations are quite different.

A factor of 10 reduction only helps a little. It\'ll give you a few
*minutes* of work time in a heavy flare.

Alas, the *true* "FTL" is "faster than the speed of light IN A VACUUM".
That\'s the one where Einstein gets involved. In media other than
vacuum, light travels more slowly and you *can* exceed the speed of
light in the medium. That\'s where the pretty blue glow in swimming
pool reactors comes from. Cerenkov radiation.

First, you use unix\'s decompress program. That will give you:
	tml-v1998-n150-n159.tar

Then you use tar to extract the individual files. 

gzip (Gnu zip) can also extract stuff from tar.Z files. Change the
.tar.Z to .taz if you are working under DOS.

In essence, a flare is a somewhat diffuse PAW hit.

Which is what I was objecting to. You *cannot* cram 14 people into a 1
meter cube unless you turn them into hamburger. The average person is
around 2m x .5m x .25m. Which gets you about *4* people per cubic meter.

I\'d say an athelete in good condition can do it. Though "sustained" is
probably going to be less than an hour.

Again, I\'d suggest that someone look up the figures for things like the

Yes, that is how you do it. It\'s no more "odd" than bathyscaphes or Harrier
jets, though I realise their designs are less familiar.

Ships with any deck orientation can turn to present whatever aspect they
want. Meson weapons target a point in space and an enemy turning sideways
will not be any harder to hit.

My understanding of the reason for configuration modifiers to meson
accuracy is that meson decay tends to spread out over a volume and
configurations like needles or wedges will have more of their volumes
outside the range of the meson decay than more compact configurations. This
will apply no matter what the deck orientation is.

Tall structures can be designed to be stable in themselves and not need any
bracing or cable stays to hold them up. Skyscrapers are designed this way,
and starships can be too. This is the point many find hard to accept, and
the topic is too involved to go into here. If you want a more detailed
explanation email me privately.

If you need a single large room you should not use a needle configuration
at all. If you want a long hallway, this can be done using any deck
orientation.

Speaking as someone who has been in several buildings designed by Arthur
Erickson, I strongly dispute the notion that minimizing up/down movement is
"good ergonomics". I don\'t know many office workers who pine for mile-long
corridors instead of elevators.

In this we will just have to agree to disagree.

It is not necessary with decks perpendicular to thrust; so long as they
keep maneuvers less than 1 G the ship can rotate to point toward the
desired direction and accelerate. This method does not work on ships with
parallel decks.

My point is that contragrav and inertial compensation are totally
unnecessary with perpendicular decks, except in high-thrust designs where
they still have the advantage. It doesn\'t matter how reliable, cheap, etc
you make contragrav, nothing is as cheap and reliable as equipment that
isn\'t needed.

My first Traveller campaign had this, and I decided against it in my later
campaigns. The problem is that total automation is less interesting
dramatically. In this setting, players tended to "ask the computer" how to
solve problems and to send robots into dangerous situations rather than go
themselves. It rewarded characters with the better hardware and made the
players less significant. No matter how "realistic" it may be, I felt it
harmed the enjoyment of the game.

        [*Excellent* information on RealWorld(tm) composition and usefulness
of asteroid belt snipped]

        Great information, thanks very much.
        However, there is a problem with it, IMHO.  Its a *lousy*
role-playing environment.  Very much makes belting a waste of time, as far
as I can see.  Very much the same vein of problem that the very real
arguement can be made that there would not be the massive trade levels
between systems that Traveller postulates.  IE:  Most likely right,  but
really complicates gaming.
        So, while I say thank-you for the data, it gets in the way of
gaming.  Any other comments about the design or the kit-bashed gaming
mechanics behind it?  I feel kind of funny writing this, as it seems stupid
saying "sorry, your post was *too* realistic.

The problem is that robots aren\'t as flexible/adaptable as humans.
Also, a robot the shape and size of a human is *weaker* than a human
until pretty high TLs. Bone is actualy a *lot* stronger than a hunk of
steel the same size.

Cruise missiles are *dumb*. Anything capable of repairing battle damage
is going to be *smart*. Smart enough that it will both be capable of
making decisions on its own and smart enough to arguably qualify as
intelligent life. Which means that you\'ve just replaced one kind of
crew with another. One that\'s more expensive to produce. :-)

Full automation that is "self-directing" gets back to the "they\'re
intelligent" bit. It also has the problem that anything flexible enough
to handle unexpected situations is flexible enough to ignore *any* rule
when it feels like it. 

Basicly, everything that\'s been learned about AI in the last 50 years
says that you can\'t get a self-directing machine *and* have rules it
will follow under all circumstances. The two are not compatible.

So you have a choice between not so bright robots that have to be told
(in more or less detail) what to do, and rescued when they hit a
situation not covered by instructions; or a "crew" that just happens to
be non-organic.

OK, the file is made using the unix tools tar and compress.  If you\'re using 
Linux, it\'s a snap:

uncompress tml*.tar.Z
tar xf tml*tar

I\'m sure there are DOS/Win tools that can deal with this format, AAMOF, 
doesn\'t the latest Winzip handle them?

I\'m not clear about this -- why _does_ an indirect-fire weapon need a beam

The character was struck at point blank by the Traveller version of a 
55gal drum of fine crystal sand with a TNT charge in the center.
The drum explodes, spraying the area with sand (to reduce laser fire 
accuracy). In this case it spread a Zhodani male across the starport in 
really small particles.
The only time I\'ve ever had a player character "vaporized" per se.

Dom had asked about Andre Norton\'s "Solar Queen" series. I\'ve listed below
both that series and her other series books (that I know of) along with
several non-series books that I\'m familiar with.

Dom:

I wasn\'t sure if you were specifically asking (on TML) about the Solar Queen
series or all her various series...so here\'s what I know of her various series
books:

Blake Walker:
The Crossroads of Time (also part of the  "Crossroads of Time Series")
Quest Crosstime

Central Control:
Star Rangers (also published as "The Last Planet")
Star Guard

The Dipple Series:
Catseye
Judgment on Janus (also part of the Janus series)

Night of Masks

Forerunner Series (also known as the Shan Lantee series):
Storm Over Warlock 
Ordeal in Otherwhere
Forerunner Foray
Forerunner
Forerunner: The Second Venture

Free Traders Series (also known as the Moon Singer series):
Moon of Three Rings
Exiles to the Stars
Flight in Yiktor
Dare to Go A-Hunting

Hosteen Storm Series:
The Beast Master
The Lord of Thunder

The Janus Series:
Judgment on Janus (also part of the Dipple series)
Victory on Janus

The Jern Murdock Series:
The Zero Stone
Uncharted Stars

Pax/Astra:
The Stars Are Ours!
Star Born

Ross Murdock/Time War Series:
Time Traders
Galactic Derelict
The Defiant Agents
The Key Out of Time
Firehand (w/P.M. Griffin)

The Solar Queen Series:
Sargasso of Space
Plague Ship
Voodoo Planet (usually found in a Ace double with Star Hunter)
Postmarked the Stars
Redline the Stars (w/P.M. Griffin)
Derelict for Trade (w/S. Smith)
A Mind for Trade (w/S. Smith)

Not sure if it is part of a series

Dread Companion
Dark Piper

Not part of any series:

Star Man\'s Son (also known as Daybreak 2250 AD or Star Man\'s Son 2250 AD)
Android at Arms
Operation Time Search
Ice Crown
Secret of the Lost Race (also known as Wolfshead)
No Night Without Stars
The Sioux Spaceman
The X Factor
Perilous Dreams
Star Hunter (backed with Voodoo Planet in most editions that I\'ve seen)
Wheel of Stars
Iron Cage
Star Gate

These are just drawn from the titles that I own. There\'s a heck of a lot more
that she\'s written! For example, I don\'t own any of the "Witch World" books,
they never appealed to me (that\'s about a 20 or so book series, if you include
collaborations and short story collections, etc.). She\'s definately been a big
influence on my Traveller campaign--and if you read the "Solar Queen" series
and others, I think she was an influence on Traveller itself!

I\'m trying to find a specific reference, but if I remember correctly the Mir
(along with Skylab, Saylut and theupcoming ISS) do **not** have a solar flare
"vault" for the crew. The reason: They orbit low enough so that the Earth\'s
own magnetic shields (Van Allen Belts) protect them from all but the worse
storms.

Now, each of these have/had "lifeboats" so that if things got really bad they
could abandon the station and return to Earth. Skylab had the Apollo command
(and service) modules, the Mir and Saylut have Soyuz capsule(s).

The ISS will initially have (I think) two Soyuz capsules on permanent
stationkeeping until the US gets the X (fill in the model number) finished and
funded and such. (I can\'t remember if it is X32...33...or 34..., but it
basically is a lifting body concept, not unlike the one that Colonel Austin
crashed at the start of each episode of a certain action/adventure show of the
70\'s...)

As for missions **above** theVan Allen zone, such as the Apollo missions to
the moon, they were planned during periods of low solar activity--in the hopes
that they would not get a surprise!

As for future missions, to Mars or wherever, a number of schemes are on the
books. Dramatic tellings of crews being zapped by radiation can be found in
various stories by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter (especially Baxter\'s
Titan, where one crew member is killed during a storm when she fails to hear
the alarm because she\'s listening to her Walkman!) as well as Kim Stanley
Robinson\'s "Red Mars" (first volume of the Mars Trilogy) and many more
besides...

(P.S.: For a really good expose on the recent fun and games on Mir, I heartily
recommend Bryan Burrough\'s "Dragonfly". It details the experiences of most of
the American astronauts that spent time on Mir. It\'s a scary book!)

You\'ve never read _Hitchhikers\' Guide to the Galaxy_ either?

*Dark Piper* is a stand-alone.  Drawing a blank on *Dread Companion* -

series.

*Android at Arms* and *Star Hunter*, as I recall, while not part of any
series share themes with many of her other books, such as the Patrol and
the Salariki (a feline race first introduced in *Plague Ship*).  And as I
said earlier, I believe *The X Factor* starts out in the Dipple.

Traveller\'s free traders certainly bear more resemblance to the Solar
Queen\'s crew than to Heinlein\'s or Cherryh\'s free traders.  And my concept
of what Scouts should be is based on her first-in scouts.

I have 70-odd of her books.  Got burned out on the Witch World after the
first dozen or so, and haven\'t bought any of the newer books in that
series.  My favourites (listed in no particular order):

     Star Rangers
     Dark Piper  (actually, I\'d have to say those two are tied for
         first place)
     Plague Ship
     Breed to Come
     Ice Crown  (a great idea for a Red Zone!)
     Android at Arms
     Galactic Derelict
     Star Gate  (the only attempt I\'ve ever seen at combining space
         travel and parallel worlds)
     Crossroads of Time  (I *love* parallel worlds)

I can accept that perpendicular decks wont need inertial compesation (so 
long as they have limited maneuverability).  But I would argue that any 
kind of starship would want artificial gravity for the time in 
jumpspace.

I thought he was, unofficially.  He was just doing it anonymously.  I 
though the entire reason for the debate(beyond the enjoyment of it), was 
due to his desire to voice his opinions and cause change.  And if that 
is the reason, then what are his views/ideology/beliefs?  Am I not 
understanding this correctly?

Use SOC as a DM.  One of the characters in my 2nd FTF game was a baroness at 
the start of the game, then through some luck and a lotta hard work, got 
kicked up to Marquesa about 7 game months into the campaign.  One \'toy\' she 
got was an Imperial \'Right to Bear Arms\' sticker on her patent of nobility, 
which meant she could carry just about anything that wasn\'t milspec any where 
in the Imperium.  Course, that *didn\'t* apply to her \'retainers\' (i.e., the 
*rest* of the party), but she would blow through customs just showing her 
Patent with a needle gun openly showing on her hip...

You may know the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything
(42).  But do you know the Question to which "42" is the Answer?  Read
the books.  Trust me (I\'m a US Army interrogator, I wouldn\'t lie...). 
You _need_ to read these books (or at very least listen to the original
BBC radio series).

True, but it sure beats going outside without one.

I\'m talking about planets with extreme law levels, 10+.  They *could* give her 
the run around, but her high SOC kept them from it.  She could have done just 
about *anything* and they would have left her alone.

In game effects, sometimes NPCs would do things for her for no apparant 
reason.  Like, one time, she used a sword on something and rilly screwed up 
the weapon.  It wasn\'t a family heirloom or anything, but an NPC who witnessed 
the event recovered the sword, had it mounted on a plaque for her, then 
presented it *AND* an heirloom quality sword of the same type to her as she 
was getting ready to leave.

It can be used to really *enhance* the experience as long as existing belting
isn\'t doing something foolish like smelting any old asteroid into <insert sci-
fi element/compound here>.  If something along those lines is being done, then
just disregard it.  If the particulars of belting aren\'t important (as it was
until I actually had a belter character in the campaign), then it doesn\'t
matter, either way.

My old civilian campaign was centered around an ex-belter and his partners.
The last time belting came up, Shadow basically told the same things (I have
the paraphrased dialogue printed, as a gaming reference).  Mostly, it was good
for library data and the mineralogical surveys in uninhabited systems (and the
"Belter Net" the ex-belter was subscribed too).  IMOA

Well I like the "hard science." : )  It\'s Traveller\'s "niche" IMO.  If I
swerved too far from "hard science," I\'d probably drop Traveller and go back
to Star Wars or pick up Alternity (which I\'ve seen alot of good things for...

thinking of buying it, but kinda wanted a hip pocket review, particularly if
it\'s translatable to BL/BR hexes.  A good third of the book seems to be
deckplans and designs, too, though I have no use for these, it seemed by my
quick glance, aside from trying FF&S approximations, which I\'m open to).

The Shudushaam Accords?  "They take jobs for people" (presumabley the people

After the Collapse, it\'s going to be *really* unpopular.  ;-)

Megacorp bulk freighters might be another matter.  Maybe have a suit on board.
Some mechanics/maintenance/repair types (though some of these could be robots,
too).  Maybe a skeleton crew, if there\'s a situation I don\'t want robots
intelligent enough to react to (like spill the beans on what my cargo actually
is).  The rest, robots/automation the whole way.  Far more cost effective.
Shouldn\'t affect canon much since I don\'t think the particulars of these
beasts has ever been fully revealed (at least enough to invalidate any canon).
They already dominate the trade.

How many scenarios, in canon, have there been when there is a flare or
radiation heavy environment?  Outside of canon, even?

Along these lines, I\'m interested in some simple numbers (preferably tied to
spectral type and luminosity) for radiation levels at the various orbital
zones.  Also, some gas giants will have this as an issue, too (Jupiter is
supposed to have a pretty mean field IIRC).  Also methods of protection on a
starship scale.

    'body' => 'While I\'m in the USMC, I learned the basics of the US Army\'s doctrine at the
US Army Armor Center in Ft Knox, Ky when I was getting tanker training.
Basically, it\'s centered around the tank (the M1A1, in particular, though A2s
are about 1/3 of the batallions IIRC).  Cavalry (and infantry) exist to
"protect and conserve the combat power of other combined arms forces."   Their
vehicles (M2\'s & 3\'s, in particular) have as their primary mission:
reconnaissance and security.  The greater armor and speed of a Bradley is much
more desirable than an M113.  The M113 can\'t keep up w/ the Abrams, in either
combat or road march.  It\'s a death trap (for the whole batallion) against an
enemy operated under combined arms.  Kill the security element, get in AT
crews/equipment, kill the tanks.  A Bradley is more survivable than an M113 in
that role.  Comfort?  I dunno bout the US Army, but for the Marines, mission
accomplishment is #1.  Troop welfare is *next.*  

Reference is FM 17-15, Tank Platoon.  HQ, Dept of the Army (my copy is April
1996, though i\'ve seen newbies w/ newer printings).

For the BMP-3 fan out there (can\'t remember who you are)... Being that the US
Army (and the US military, in general) is centered around combined arms
(meaning there will almost always be an Abrams around when there\'s a Bradley,
even in the cavalry troop), a BMP-3 is going to be looking at 120mm APFSDSDU
coming its way.  A BMP-3 is a tad higher on the threat list than the others.
Speaking as a tanker (and a gunner at that), this will get them killed a whole
lot more.  :-)  The smaller weapons are alot easier to ignore than the 100mm
on the BMP-3, at least when there are other targets.  The two tank platoons in
the armored cavalry troop will see to it, that is if air don\'t get it.  Course
the Army doesn\'t have the luxury the Marines have... independant air support.
:-)

Now, for the US Marines, we have it the other way around.  The tanks are
support for the infantry.   For whoever u where who was saying how fun it is
to ride in an AAV... it\'s NOT!  lol.  I much prefer being in the Abrams for
the amphibious landing and that isn\'t (much) fun either (especially after!).

Ob Trav.  The Imperial Army and Imperial Marines are likely the same way as
the US on this doctrine, except the Imperial Marines are primarily space
(heavy infantry/jump troops) rather than amphibious w/ grav tanks, APCs,
ortillery, etc as support.  See the TO&E of the Imperial Marine MArCav
regiment.  :-)  Imperial Army?  Trepidas and Astrins substituted for Abrams
and Bradleys, though TL-15 Heavy Grav Tanks for higher TL worlds, and you
should have the gist of it.  Regency Combat Vehicle Guide is invaluable for
this discussion. : )

I think that the assumption you are missing is that the Captain is the one
looking for passengers to a specific location.  At that point it becomes a
"coming along for the ride" scenario.  Basically, you post your destination and
wait for people to sign on.

The theory you\'re presenting is called Chartering a starship, and it is a
different set of rules entirely.

M2A2...i didn\'t know that was a real tank, I remember seeing in my old twilight 2k
book and thinking that it was some sorta projection or extrapolation.  the
twilight 2k book shows a weird looking picture and mentions something about a

Indeed.  The acids from fruits also help bring out the flavor of meats.

Some common examples:
Fish with lemon
Duck with orange
Beef with orange (often in Chinese dishes)
Pork with apple

Pineapple\'s relatively strong flavor (as fruits go), is especially well
suited to
balance spicy meat, especially sausage.

Ob. Trav...  This got me thinking about Third Imperium cuisine, Vilani Shugili\'s
and the like.  Shugili\'s have their secrets, but I\'m wondering if there might be some
parallels to the Kosher laws.  The one I always remember is that it is not kosher
to cook an animal in the milk of its mother (so no cooking of beef in butter).
Rastafarians have their own rules about diet.

It has characteristics of both fruits and vegetables.  Its not clearly in one
of the other.
IIRC, vegetable like because it doesn\'t grow from the blossom
of a flower.  Fruit like because it contains seeds.

The Twilight 2000 M1A2 with the casemated turret was an invention of the
game.  

The real M1A2 is a "digitized" MBT.  It looks almost the same as the M1A1
(with an extra thermal sight for the commander) but is radically rewired
internally.  Instead of lots of separate electronic systems (many of them
analog) the M1A2 has a digital data bus so that the internal electronics
can work together and an Inter-Vehicular Information System (IVIS) for
sharing position information, maps, status reports, orders, etc between
vehicles.

ObTrav: this sort of capability should be totally second nature to high
tech combat vehicles (and even battledress infantry) in the Third Imperium.
 Unit commanders should be routinely sending digital maps of planned
actions or movements, checking the status of their subordinates, holding
briefings over comm links, etc.  When you have a regiment or division
covering a whole planet, face-to-face meetings will not be practical.

No, that\'s the answer.

Say a world is law-level ten, but the family members of the ruling
oligarchy can get away with murder.  (Example: the families of high party
members in the USSR).

An Oligarch\'s son stands the same chance of being arrested for deviant
decadent behavior, but when they find out who he is (and more importantly,
who his father is), he\'ll be released with an apology.

What you as the Referee do is decide to whom the laws don\'t apply and why.
Possible reasons are religious, corruption, financial, or some other
influence.

Helicopters. Not front line fighters and strike aircraft, with dedicated
aviation roles clearly defined.

The best that the Army can do is the AH-64C.  The USMC has organic F/A-18
and AV-8B units as part of their commands structure at a far lower level
that we do.  Army units have to liase with an entirely different branch to
get air support, and that branch has different priorities.

Anyway, IIRC there\'s only one Air Cav unit left, the 6th ACCB at Ft. Hood.

Actually because Linux uses the GNU version of tar you should be able to save 
yourself typing effort and disk space using:

tar -Zxf tml*tar.Z

which will both uncompress and extract the file, without leaving the 
uncompressed archive lying around. On most other UNIXen you should be able to 
achieve the same effect through:

zcat file.tar.Z | tar -xf-

Yes, as I remember it handles the compression and the archival (ie it does 
both an uncompress and a tar).

like the basis for  a system.  Perhaps make characters on Low Law Level
Planets roll Soc or less on 2d6, Mod law planets on 2.5 or 3d6, High Law

Whatever you say, Clif.

I\'m not in the mood for having a helpful suggestion that I made turn into
some sort of argument.

Roleplay it. There\'s no rule or set of rules that will work in even a
minority of the situations of the type you requested information on. The
only solution is to wing it... Y\'know, come up with something on the fly
that is appropriate. That\'s really the only way. There are no magic rules.

There is a difference between _views_ and _ideology_ and
_espoused_positions_.  Look at any U.S. politician for proof.

Unofficially, it\'s a pretty good bet that one of the "orators" in
the debate is, in fact, Dulinor himself.  I\'ll even go so far as
to say that I will be His Grace\'s alter-ego in this debate.  But
you don\'t need to know what is views or ideology are; you need to
consider his espoused ideas, and that only in the persona context
of the debate.  I will say this, though - this is the hardest
piece of writing I have done in many years; it is not easy making
a reasoned and convincing argument for a position that one is
strongly though perhaps not viscerally opposed to in real life.

Officially, the Archduke\'s office is watching the debate with
interest, but has no comment at this time on the views espoused
by either side.  And this official position will be reflected in
the official positions of most if not all of the other August
Personages that the Press may choose to make inquiries of
concerning the matter.  That is an important aspect of the entire
premise; the use of anonymity - even blatant anonymity - is to
minimise the chances of _personalities_ influencing the debate
itself.  Certainly, there will be "leaks" from various "unnamed
sources close to" the August Personages which will indicate the
Personage\'s personal views on the matter - but deniability will
be maintained, mostly because _nobody_knows_what_the_Emperor_
_thinks,_or_how_he_will_react._  If Bzrk of Antares comes out
publicly for the activist/democratic position, and the Emperor
decides separately that this is a _very_ bad thing for the
Imperium, he will certainly be influenced toward the removal of
His Grace of Antares, as being unreliable.  Noblesse Oblige must
be given at least lip service; one does not wish to offend the
Emperor to whom one has sworn loyalty.

As I say, positions will become clear when the in-persona
postings start - which will be as soon as I finish writing
Dulinor\'s case (a difficult job for me, as I indicated above -
but that\'s part of what makes it fun for me).

The BITS website http://www.bits.org.uk/ has just been updated and now
includes the following:

102 Vehicles for Marc Miller\'s Traveller (T4).
- ----
Yes, a month after 101 Starships for GURPS Traveller, Rob Prior has done it
again. This time BITS presents you over a hundred vehicles for T4, designed
with the Central Supply Catalog rules and Rob\'s Infini-V Software for MacOS
(also available from BITS). The vehicles range from the mundane to the
exotic and should give the harrassed GM some help. And Tech Levels are
included!

Why 102 Vehicles? Because DGP had a 101 Vehicles, and calling this latest
101 Series product 102 Vehicles avoided any legal problems, and
differentiated from the DGP book.

This free download is in Acrobat format, and co-hosted with Freelance
Traveller. Size approx 460 kb. Archives page.

Armour Compendium for Marc Miller\'s Traveller.
- ----
Designed by Dave Nelson, this single page Acrobat file contains all the
different types of armour in the various T4 rulebooks, and lists the
special rules. An ideal companion to the existing T4 Combat Cribsheet on
the \'archive page\'.

Rob Prior\'s software.
- ----
All the demos for Rob Prior\'s software published by BITS are now available
via the products page. These include Infini-V, QSDS and Imperial Grand
Survey (late beta). GURPS Traveller Shipyard will eventually be here too.
All require the freeware Stuffit Expander to decompress, and at present are
only for MacOS.

Rob\'s other software is still at http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/RPS.html
and includes Metator, MegaCharacter and others. This page will be revised
in the near future to remove IGS2 and the other BITS products.

TowerCon 99
- ----
BITS are planning to be at TowerCon 99 - so far attendees planned are Andy
Lilly, myself and possibly Richard Talbot. As well as RPG demos, we plan to
have the latest version of the Full Thrust Traveller system for playtest,
and probably an ACQ demo. Details of the Con may be found via the
Travelling page on the BITS website.

Comments are welcome.

Here\'s an appetizer:


History

Vilani explorer first ventured into Dagudashagg in -8100. Mimu and Iiradli
subsectors were settled as early as around -8000, during the initial Vilani
expansion into space. As only these to subsectors were accessible from the
Vilani Main, it took some time before the jump-1 restricted Vilani could
efficiently venture into the rest of Dagudashaag, but with the establishment
of deep space refuelling stations at 0318 and 0411 around -7100, regular albeit
expensive connections were established between the Vilani and Dagudashaag
Mains. Later, around -6800, another deep space refuelling station was
established at 2338, linking the Dagudashaag Main with the Sylean Main, and
thereby opening large portions of Core sector as well as Kuriishe subsector up
for exploration and trade.

As the three bureaux were formed, Dagudashaag was assigned to Naasirka together with Gushemege, Ilelish and Verge. Records from this period shows the first uses of the name Dakhukuga Gulike Dushaage for the area. The name means "Rimward Galactic Province", and has over time been corrupted and contracted to Dagudashaag.

The rimward parts of Dagudashaag constituted part of the frontier of the Vilani Economic Sphere when the Consolidation Wars broke out in -5400. From here, the Vilani advanced on their foes with their newly developed jump-2 technology. The deep space refuelling station at 2338 was dismantled, as were other similar installations everywhere along the border, and jump-2 tenders were commissioned to service the still large amount of Vilani jump-1 commercial traffic which was still going on. The deep space stations connecting the Vilani and Dagudashaag Main were considered to be inside safe territory, and were first decommissioned several centuries later when jump-2 had come into widespread commercial use.

After the Consolidation Wars the Ziru Sirka was established in -4045, and Dagudashaag prospered and then stagnated together with the rest of the First Imperium. By -2800 the empire was slowly beginning to come apart at the seams, but Dagudashaag still enjoyed relative peace and quiet, being a neighbor to Vland and situated deep within the Ziru Sirka.

In -2422 the Solomani made first contact with the First Imperium. For a very long time, this historical event went unnoticed in Dagudashaag. First with the Eighth and Ninth Interstellar Wars, any notice was taken of the events to rimward, but even then, Dagudashaag continued on as before. As the fighting of the Nth Interstellar War drew closer, the sector mobilized, but was unable to stop the advancing Solomani forces.

In -2271 the sector saw action for the first time in the Battle of Gheesak, which marked the beginning of the first Solomani campaign in Dagudashaag. During the next 52 years the Solomani consistenly rolled over the sector in their continued drive towards Vland. In -2222 the Solomani offensive had landed in Vland sector, and by -2219 it was all over.

During the Rule of Man, Dagudashaag saw it\'s share of unemployment, civil unrest and petty wars as the new empire continued the fall of the First Imperium. Around -1600 some worlds began to form small interstellar states as a bulwark against the oncoming Long Night, but to no avail. During the Long Night, most worlds lost interstellar capabilities, and many populations died out as technology declined. The sector was hard hit.

Around -500 Sylean traders and scouts recontacted worlds in Dagudashaag. With Sylean technology many worlds again took to the stars, and trade began to flourish. Dagudashaag slowly revitalized. When the Third Imperium formed, many worlds resisted being included in the new empire, due to bad experiences from the Rule of Man. Lancian philosophy was spreading deep into the sector from neighboring Gushemege.

The Imperium first tried to win over the worlds of the sector by economic and diplomatic means, but although many worlds joined the Third Imperium, resistance was growing on many more. A technological power base with the potential to rival that of the Imperium was building up in parts of Vland, Gushemege and Dagudashaag.

As a counterstrike, emperor Artemsus launched the Vilani Pacification Campaign in 76, headed by the Archduke of Vland. Different cultural groups in the area drew unpleasant parallels to the Consolidation Wars 5000 years earlier and resisted violently. The campaign affected Mimu, Old Suns, Arnakhish, Shallows, Ushra, Khandi, Pact and Sapphyre subsectors as well as subsectors in Gushemege, Corridor and Vland, and was unusually long and bloody. In the end, the young Imperium\'s much larger production base proved an unstoppable juggernaut. The Vilani Pacification Campaign ended in 120.

The next 400 years was characterized by rebuilding and progress. In 604 the Civil War broke out, and rapidly spread to Dagudashaag due to the sector\'s closeness to Core. During the war, the Lancians continually worked to restore normalcy. When Arbellatra came on the scene, the Lancians were some of her earliest supporters. The culture used considerable resources to support her. As a recognition of that help, the empress proclaimed the formation of the Lancian Cultural Region in 639. The Region is placed mainly in Gushemege, but also encompasses Mimu subsector of Dagudashaag, as well as Sashrakusha subsector of Corridor.

Since the end of the Civil War, Dagudashaag has enjoyed a relatively uneventful existence.

Dagudashaag in the Rebellion

In 1116 emperor Strephon was assasinated by archduke Dulinor; an event which sparked the Rebellion. In 1117 Dagudashaag saw some of the first heavy fleet battles of the Rebellion, as Lucan\'s and Dulinor\'s forces clashed. Especially Argi and Sapphyre subsectors were hard hit. In late 1117 news about Strephon\'s survival began to spread widely in Dagudashaag sector.

In 1118 a new front formed as many worlds in Mimu subsector declared their allegiance to the "Real" Strephon, although no real fighting took place. The frontline between Lucan\'s and Dulinor\'s forces stabilized somewhat in Sapphyre subsector, although heavy fighting was still taking place. Dulinor launched raids deep into Core sector, with major battles also taking place in Khandi and Kuriishe subsectors.

1119 still saw no major fighting on the "Real" Strephon/Lucan front in Dagudashaag, although the two parties were involved in heavy fighting elsewhere. On the other front, Lucan\'s forces pursued Dulinor\'s fleets through Dagudashaag as they withdrew from their raids in Core. Again, Khandi and Kuriishe subsectors saw heavy fighting. Meeting determined resistance from Dulinor\'s forces in Zeda, The Remnants, Pact and Sapphyre subsectors, Lucan\'s admiral Wainfrost retreated, bombarding Biik (0323 Dagudashaag), Ispumer (1222 Dagudashaag), Dashi (1723 Dagudashaag), Ekhugush (1728 Dagudashaag), Medurma (2124 Dagudashaag), Dipa (2223 Dagudashaag), Ikapi (1929 Dagudashaag) and Durgaarur (1735 Dagudashaag) with nuclear weapons, initializing a new "scorched earth" strategy. Dulinor\'s forces halted their advances.

By 1119 all four Vilani megacorporations had successfully liquidated their assets and retreated to Vland sector. Dagudashaag, like most other sectors, was left with a massive economic and industrial vaccuum.

In 1120 Dulinors forces were pushed further back by admiral Wainfrost. Hostilities intensified in Eddum, Argi and Sapphyre subsectors, and new fighting broke out in Old Suns subsector, as clashes between the "Real" Strephon, the Ziru Sirkaa and Lucan spilled over the border from Vland.

Worlds have been laid to waste, billions of people have died and property and equipment for countless billions credits has been destroyed.

I agree - her books and the Tubbs? ones with Dumarest in.

Sargasso was my first SF novel... shame she\'s hard to get hold of in the UK
(I end up using an internet bookshop to get them). Cherryh is almost as
hard to get.

This is a TL14 High Guard 2nd Edition design.

MP-54222S1-000000-00000-0 173.5626 MCr  500 tons TL14
Passengers=0. Low=0. Cargo=255. Fuel=110 EP=10 Agility=2

Notes.

This design is a simple Jump-2, 2G starship designed specifically to haul
freight, no passengers.

The ship is designed to be partially streamlined to allow easy gas giant
skimming, with built-in fuel purification added.  Provision is made for 9
crewsophonts: Owner-Aboard, Pilot, Navigator, Medic, 2 Engineers, and 3
optional Gunners.  It is delivered unarmed, but 3 tons of space are
reserved for the fire control circuitry for 3 turrets.  The ship has 3
hardpoints, no added armor.  9 staterooms are availiable for the crew.

The ship carries a Slow Pinace (40tons, 2G) to allow the crew to visit
planetary surfaces easier.  Additionally, 30 of the ship\'s 255 ton cargo
capacity is carried in the boat during jump.  The pinnace is piloted by
either the pilot of the ship or anybody with Ship\'s Boat skill.  Its 18
MCr price tag *is* included in the total price, but no discount is given
for it, since the 18 MCr is already discounted.

This ship can be ordered for MCr 34.71252 down, with payments of KCr
723.177/month.  Salaries, assuming full compliment, are 24,500 a month,
life support is 36,000.  1/12th of the annual maintanance is 14,464, for a
total of 820,341 Cr/month.  Revenues of 1000/ton of freight come to
510,000/month, leaving a shortfall of 310,341 a month, or 608 Cr/ton/trip.

Assuming 50% freight and 50% speculative cargo, fully loaded, speculative
cargo must only clear 2217 cr/ton, easy enough if your Owner Aboard is a
Broker-2 or better.


At 174 MCr, the Van Rijn class compares favorably to a stock Free Trader
at 37.08MCr, with a Jump-2 cargo ratio of .68 to the Type A\'s ratio of
.915, and is a downright steal compared to the Type M liner\'s Jump-2 cargo
ratio of 1.225!

(Note:  I came up with a \'cargo ratio\' to evaluate designs against.  To
get the numbers, divide the list price of the ship by cargo space in
displacement tons.  Multiply this by distance in parsecs, divided by the
ship\'s maximum jump number.  The lower the number, the more efficient a
freighter you have.  For example, a stock Scout Courier at 2 parsecs has
a cargo ratio of 7.357!!)

Okay, but in my book, AH-64\'s qualify as "air support" when they can pop off

Do me a favor.  Stop asking for advice.  You never take it, and then whine
about us not understanding you.

Traveller law levels are an arbitrary code showing the general level of
official intrusion into people\'s lives.  If you, as the world-builder, want
a certain class to be immune to those laws, just write it down!

Example:  Tengalia is a Religious dictatorship.  Church officials above a
certain level have nothing to fear from the local law (level: C) as they
are "Venerated Masters", and are assumed to be working under the direct
hand of the deities.  To arrest one of them would be like arresting God!

Example: Novo Leningrad a police state with incredibly repressive laws
(level E).  High Party members and their families (who hold special
passports and ID papers) can openly do things that would get the ordinary
citizens shot.

Example: The United States.  In many cases laws are enforced less harshly
for celebrities than for the common mob.  Witness the number of Hollywood
types who get rehab for possession vs. the number of South Central kids who
get prison time for the same charge.

Amazingly enough, designing and running a Traveller game takes a little
effort and work.  Not everything can be modeled on a die roll.

But to be honest, I would think that reading *some* science-fiction would

Which does nil to the enemy artillery, command structure, fuel dumps 30km
behing the FEBA..  The Marines can hit all that, and kill tanks.  That\'s
air support.

	You\'re being a bit harsh.  Clif\'s request was a legitimate one.  Sometimes
having a quick rule to determine if your Baron is going to get through a check
point with his hidden stash of microfilm will save aggravation and bad
feeling.   Yes, if it\'s a major point like a murder trial, it should be role-
played, but if it\'s a question of traffic tickets, shipping irregularities,
lack of hunting permit etc, a die roll connecting Soc with Law Level will help
you as the referee decide how the role-playying encounter will turn out,
especially if the players have wandered out of a preset, well-developed area.

Do ME a favor and not answer my posts if you can\'t give me what I\'m looking
for.  I asked for a system, not "roleplay it".  "Roleplay it" is an answer
so in front of our nose\'s that I wouldn\'t have come to the list to hear

it"?  Okay?

I wonder if any popular sci-fi writer just sat down without a daily intake
of someone else\'s sci-fi and actually visualized and put to paper a world
worthwhile.

I bet someone did.

Some people write what most people consume.  I don\'t see why I can\'t write
fresh sci-fi without input and the influence of other writers.  Bill Gates
keeps a virgin staff.  Why can\'t my campaign be a virgin world, with ideas,
while similar to others in print, envisioned independent of outside
influence?

When I was in the Air Cav, it was our mission to be behind enemy lines,

Imagine I have a needle config ship 40 meters long. If it\'s got decks

I\'ve generally seen two reasons for parallel deckplans: either you land,

An interesting twist would be to make it an opposed skill roll, with
uncertain results.  In other words, the law enforcement types try to
roll under Law Level, and the potential harassee try to roll under
Social Standing (modified by whatever modifiers seem appropriate). 
Whichever one makes the skill roll by the most "has initiative" in the
encounter.  F\'r instance, Baron von Furstinline (Social Standing of C)
is visiting Terra circa 1100 (Law Level of 9).  Both roll 2d6.  If the
Good Baron makes his roll by more than Chief Inspector Dreyfus, then von
Furstinline is approached, and "his papers are in order."  If Dreyfus
makes her roll by more than the Baron, then Dreyfus notes some
irregularity.  This irregularity will be minor, and will normally result
in no official action (unless, of course, the PC is spooked into
overreacting >;-) .  If one party fails the roll, and the other makes
it, then events move more decisively in that party\'s favor.  Should
_both_ parties fail the roll, compare the dergree of failure.  If the PC
fails by more than the police, then there is a wrongful arrest, which is
not seen by the authorities as wrongful.  If, OTOH, the police fail by
more than the PC, then there is also a wrongful arrest, _which is
actionable_ as a wrongful arrest.  Can you say "lawsuit"?  (Or, better
yet, the noble PC has friends who can not only get him/her/it out of
trouble, but also end the career [or life] of the poor cop who made the
arrest.)

I don\'t think they have one, though I might be wrong.  IIRC, aside from their
other acquisitions in armor from various NATO powers, they\'ve focused on their
domestically produced Merkava (the Merkava III is the curent model, w /a 120mm
main gun), which basically sums up the fears they learned in the Yom Kippur
war, in particular.  Fairly formidable, if unconventional design.  A true
"infantry support" tank.  It can carry troops (4 IIRC), has a mortar, etc etc.
It\'s slow as hell, though, w/ a diesel engine.  Run and gun is how we\'d beat
it (assuming we didn\'t have air trash em).  Course, this is all just
hypothetical. :-)

The only thing on that piece of electronic trash I\'d like is the IVIS, which
is very useful.  Everythign else can go.  While I\'ve never done any sort of
operation in one, I\'ve heard nothing but bad about them (mostly from the few
soldiers (drill sgts) attached to the the Marine training company at Ft Knox).
The electronics have a really nasty habit for failure (built by the lowest
bidder and all that) and while an A1 can be fought w/o its electronics (even
w/o power!), the same can\'t be said of an A2.  Harder to drive, far too
reliant on the electronics.   The mech\'s say even more vicious things, but
they would. ;-)

Yeah.  It should be second nature really by late TL-8 or TL9 (10 tops).
Incorporating that would certainly make things easier, though they would have
to train in the "old ways" as auxilliary for the occasions that the high-tech
stuff don\'t work (for whatever reason).

RCVG says it\'s usual for an Imperial/Regency Marine Regiment to be given
responsibility for an entire planet (squads or platoons for whole countries),
which results in very low unit density.   For that reason, the Imperial Marine
Grav APC (TL-15) has a full sized, standard computer to tie in all the data
from the units and the "constellation" of orbital surveillance and
communications satellites around any word which has ongoing military
operations.    They\'re said to "be able to track, access, coordinate, and
route all intelligence, communications, and all command and control
instructions to and from subordinate and superior units."  Must be nice. :-)

If you want, I\'ll play Dulinor-in-disguise.  Or maybe one of his supporters,
if you don\'t want to give it up.  I\'ve always been sympathetic to his faction
(particularly the line in the Imperial Encyclopedia, ref\'s section, that says
"Dulinor acted entirely properly, as was his right as an archduke").  Some of
his later decisions (in Survival Margin) seem pretty weird, though its really
ironic that if Virus hasn\'t been released, he would have won (he got within
two or three jumps of Capital before his whole Coronation Fleet starts going
crazy and malfunctions) the Rebellion (as much as can be said after 14 years
of the 2nd Civil War).

You wanna be Brzk?  Stay with Dulinor (and i\'ll be the Duke of Verge or
someone).  Or who, in the era of IY 1116, do you most identify your personal
views on the Imperium with?  

I happen to be agree with alot of Dulinor\'s apparent views of the Imperium.
Especially if you buy M:0, the Imperium was corrupt, if not rotten to the
core, and shouldn\'t have winked at the petty dictators and megacorp oligarchs
IMO.  It\'s fall isn\'t so much a tragedy, in my eyes, when it\'s looked at that
way (though I almost always get that sense when I read Survival Margin...
damn, i love that book). ;-)

Hmm... if it was me, and I had everythign else in place.  I\'d have challenged
the Emperor instead of just shooting him w/o any warning.  The Illelish Guard
would\'ve still taken care of the other guards (or at least saw that they
didn\'t interfere) and I don\'t think (or at least I hope not!) that Strephon
was the type to hide behind his wife or daughter.  See if he\'s got cajones or
not.  :-)  The Aslan don\'t get pissed off by this, either and Dulinor probably
woudn\'t have gotten all the bad press from most of the Imperial public.  After
all, it would\'ve been a "noble duel" instead of murder with a cause.

Their Social Status Score might be a little odd. Recall how Muslims used
to treat the mentally ill - they were "touched by God" and were left to
their own devices. Where religion is involved, strict logic often isn\'t.
(Note: I\'m *not* trying to imply that officials of a church are mentally ill!!)
Imagine if to be a high church official on Tengalia you had to take vows
of complete poverty, but (once you achieved a certain level) you could
take what you wanted when you wanted it (but not keep it). Also, imagine 
that being a Church official gave you immunity to secular laws, as long as
you strictly followed unusual church vows. 
Your social standing might be high, but you certainly aren\'t paying the 
rulebook dictated Cr per month for it...and your social skills, administrative 
skills, and authority outside church matters might be nil. Yes, they won\'t 
arrest you for walking into a store and taking a handful of emeralds, but they 
might not let you smuggle wine through star port customs. 

I think the point was that there will be societies that arrest and punish
everybody regardless of social level, and societies that let high social
level people get away with things.

I can even imagine societies where high social level people are held to
a higher standard than low social level people...say a Soc 0 thief gets
away with a flogging, while a Soc A person gets imprisoned or worse
(because she is supposed to know better).

I was using the term ideology very loosely.  I was thought you would 
catch my drift.  But obviously not, because no one has answered my 
question.
I\'ll ask again, using your terminolgy, what are his espoused ideas then?  
Is there any previously written material on this or were you planning on 
writing it yourself?

I can imagine such things, too, but I think these are ideals and if
Traveller is pretty much based on Darwinism(is it?), you have to assign a
pecking order to every species.  The nature of government is to govern, and
you need people to govern.  (Even if robots and computers did the governing,
someone would have to program and maintain them--unless, of course, they
started programming and maintaining themselves, ala Terminator)  Those who
govern are usually above the rule systems they set in place, receiving mere
slaps on the wrist for offenses which would put other people in the electric
chair.

I\'ve had a Baron stare down a few cops before simply because they didn\'t 
want to risk the backlash of arresting a visiting noble. On some worlds, 
the law enforcement will "overlook" things for certain levels of society 
on the average. On that encounter, it would have been a task roll using 
the soc as a modifier, but we had much more fun role-playing it. As a 
referee, I am willing to give people much more leeway in attempting 
tasks if the are willing to roleplay it.

The 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat), is a standard US Army corps aviation
brigade that happens to trace its lineage from the 6th Air Cavalry Combat
Brigade of the Vietnam era. The designation is retained for reasons of
history and esprit de corps.

The Air Cavalry is, however, alive and well.

Every division in the United States Army (active and reserve) has an
organic divisional cavalry squadron, and each of these has between two and
four air cavalry troops. The 1-17th Cav (82d Abn Div) and 2-17th Cav (101st
Abn Div (AASLT)) have no organic ground cavalry assets, and so are pure
"air cav" squadrons (although not identified as such).

In addition, all three armored cavalry regiments (2d and 3d -- active; 172d
- -- TNARNG) have organic regimental aviation squadrons (4/2, 4/3, and 4/172,
respectively), consisting of three air cavalry troops, two attack
helicopter troops (AH-64), one assault helicopter troop (UH-60), and
support elements.

Finally, the squadrons of one regiment of attack helicopters (6th) carry
cavalry designations and lineage; besides the 6th Cav Brigade (which
includes two squadrons of the 6th Cav Regiment, to add to the confusion),
there is also the aviation brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. While not
strictly speaking "air cav" units, you might have a hard time convincing
them to give up their spurs and Stetsons.

This and the rest of the calculations are based on the assumption that the
character generation system produces people who are representative of the
population as a whole, which IMO is a very iffy supposition. I don\'t even
think it safe to assume that they are representative of the people who
take up the very limited subsection of careers covered by the CGS. At best
it show the subsection of members of these careers who go on to become
adventures.

And, yes, I know that most canonical adventures use NPCs generated by the
CGS, something that is, again IMO, a really big mistake.

Hey all technical RPGs are prone to this problem, when you can 
pre-select the hardware for a mission. In one (non-traveller) game at my 
games club it got so prevalent that we started to use the expression 
"When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping!".

I agree that *total* automation would get pretty boring, and if you 
allow helpful sentient computers then this diminishes the role of the 
PCs. However if PCs rely on help from non-sentient computers or even 
sentient computers with a non-human centric viewpoint then they are 
looking for trouble.

There are two arguments here. The real world one that you are referring 
to, and the Gurps robots/computer rules. 

I was originally referring to Gurps Robots & Gurps computer rules. My 
responses are a mixture of the two. 

By G:TL10(CT:TL12) robots are stronger, and even non-sentient are fairly 
autonomous within their defined roles. Gurps computer programs can 
replace most non physical roles without being sentient.

I would have thought a robot with an expert system in "battle damage 
repair" would be able to cope pretty well without being sentient. With a 
full database of previous battle damage incidents and best practice 
repair techniques it should be quicker and better adapted than a human.

With a mixture of a few living-sentient crew and a larger number of 
non-sentient robots this should be more cost effective than living crew 
alone?

>One that\'s more expensive to produce. :-)

No way. I haven\'t fully costed my 7 year old daughter 8-) but she comes 
in at way more than a $22,000 Gurps TL10 T-64 Tinkerbot General purpose 
Technical/Engineering robot (9 months lost salary, Nursery fees, ongoing 
care and "maintenance" costs and a lot more to "pay" before she is 
independant...). Even if robots cost ten time the price they would still 
be cheaper. Though I guess some form of communal upbringing would be a 
lot cheaper!

The "lead time" on humans leaves a lot to be desired :)

>Full automation that is "self-directing" gets back to the "they\'re

Well G:T specifically rules out fully sentient robots, so I was not 
proposing these. A military ship with just living command staff end 
everything else robots is doable under G:T rules. Commercial ships 
*could* be totally automated (but boring).

Gurps non-sentient Neural net robots probably come close for most 
purposes.

Of course, real life is more complicated :-)

One item is fines:

In the UK, fining someone £150 is seen as a "slap on the wrist".
If the media wants to it can get run the "judges go easy on crime"
story with the victim "demanding justice".

If you have debts and a discretionary income of about £1/month, then £150
is a lot. If you have £50,000 in the bank and a discreationary income
of £400/month, then it really is nothing.

So a few years back the government changed the rules so that fines were
a percentage of disposable incomes.

The complaints caused by £1,000 motoring offenses vs £200 for assault
totally miss the point (of course). As did people who didn\'t complete
the forms correctly and were assesed as having the default income (25K
or whatever). The changes were soon withdrawn.

===

These give a couple of options - one is the "fair" system where fines
are on a scale of Cr2^SOC and "justice" systems where fines are on a
fixed scale (Cr100 on a poor world, Cr10K on a rich world :-)

There is also the question of how players are assessed - an assumption
of 1% profit on assets might be inconvienient for your cash strapped
merchant (your merchants are all cash strapped, aren\'t they?)

And what is the penalty for not declaring all their income so enable their
fines to be properly assessed?

Maybe, maybe not, considering that fame is very transitory, and most of the

ACQ is designed for a specific thing that needs detail, combat.  Designing

IIRC the delta clipper a rocket and doesn\'t appreciate having the rocket
nozzles too near the ground.

A trav ship with contra grav doen\'t have this problem and can either
rest on the CG plates or with them about 5cm from the ground.

If the landing gear fails then it won\'t topple.

If it is so tall that 5cm is enough to make it topple, then consider
the ground pressure and tell me if this ship should really be
landing on a planet.

In any case, use a flying saucer design instead :-)

Put a stack of books by your toilet, by your bed, and on your breakfast
table. Mount a bookholder on your vacuum cleaner. Read a paragraph or two
at a time.

Seriously, that\'s what I do. Works as long as my work week stays under 60
hours (70 hours with travel time).

OK, I was exaggerating about the vacuum cleaner. The rest is when I read
fiction, though.

You can, and it can.

Just don\'t be surprised when you come up with a great new idea, and people
say "we saw that years ago". Happens all the time with Microsoft. At
least, those of us with Macs saw most \'new\' Microsoft ideas years ago.  :-)

This isn\'t a slam at you. Although I haven\'t recommended any reading
myself (because others have given you a good list), I _do_ strongly
suggest finding the time to read the \'classics\'. Partly this is to save
you time reinventing the wheel, although if you _like_ inventing wheels
then this isn\'t an issue. But the other part is that there are some ideas
that have been done so well, or so often, that there is little to add.
Stan Schmidt has a list of stories that he gets every month, all original,
yet all of ideas so common that there is nothing new in them.

I can imagine such things, too, but I think these are ideals and if
Traveller is pretty much based on Darwinism(is it?), you have to assign a
pecking order to every species.  The nature of government is to govern, and
you need people to govern.  (Even if robots and computers did the governing,
someone would have to program and maintain them--unless, of course, they
started programming and maintaining themselves, ala Terminator)  Those who
govern are usually above the rule systems they set in place, receiving mere
slaps on the wrist for offenses which would put other people in the electric
chair.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We\'ve had societies like this already on Earth, Clif.

England, a hundred years ago or so. A tradesman accuses another
tradesman of cheating at cards, one or the other gets a knuckle 
sandwich and they\'re done with it. A gentleman accuses another
gentleman of the same offense, the cheating gentleman (or the
wrongful accuser) gets a sword put in his gut by the other.

(Duelling. If you win, you must have been in the right. <G>)

Refuse the duel, lose prestige, and position in society, and business
connections, and wealth, etc...

Today, USA. A Gas Station Attendant has a consensual affair with
a part-time cashier, him and his wife settle it. The President has a
consensual affair with a member of the part-time help, he ends up in
a tangle that puts him on trial in front of the world. 

Granted, the bigwigs often skirt the law...but they are also often held
up to high standards, at least publicly.

Also, consider that in a future society law enforcement officers and
interested members of the public may have no difficulty proving that
an offense was committed. Who would get a bigger penalty for cowardice
in the face of the enemy: a private in charge of one laser rifle, or a
general in charge of the entire world\'s defense?

With greater power may eventually come greater responsibility and
greater accountability. Yup, it is a tad idealistic, but why not someday?

It depends.  Are we talking about the Dalai Lama, or just any old monk?

In other words, yes, they do.  It varies by their position within the
hierarchy, as well as the society in which they are.  A monk in the US
probably wouldn\'t be anyone special, but an abbot in \'old\' Tibet was a
bigshot.  Then there\'s the habit in some buddhist countries of males
spending a couple of years as monks, before returning to the world.  The
social status of such a monk would be pretty average, although if they were
someone important \'outside\' they might or might not get some kind of
special treatment.

    'body' => 'Toward an Imperium for the People

"Gallatin"

The history of the Imperium is one of both peace and stability, and 
conflict and instability.  Throughout that thousand-plus years, however, 
one feature stands out above all others: The Imperium exists for the 
benefit of the megacorporate interests trading between the Member 
Worlds, not for the benefit of those worlds themselves, nor for the 
benefit of the citizens of the Imperium who live on these worlds.

What _is_ the Imperium, to most?  It is a distant abstraction, that has 
no perceptible effect on their lives.  The Imperium does not "interfere" 
in the "internal governance" of the Member Worlds, allowing them to 
maintain oppressive conditions against their people in some cases, or to 
continue "benign" neglect of their needs in others.  There is no reason 
for the people to look to the Imperium, to say with pride, "I am a 
citizen of the Imperium, and my world is an Imperial world."  Instead, 
we see people identifying with their own regions, their own worlds, 
their own races - "I am Vilani."  "I am Jonkereen." "I am from 
Prometheus." "I am from Vilis."  

The people do not identify with the Imperium because they see no benefit 
from the Imperium.  In the abstract, they understand some of the 
benefits of the Imperium - protection against incursion by the Vargr or 
Aslan or Zhodani or Solomani militant rebels, the economic benefits of 
the free trade fostered by the Imperium, and so on - but little of this 
actually affects most citizens of the Imperium on a day-to-day basis.

Can the Imperium survive a fundamental crisis?  The Civil War of the 
600s was the most serious crisis that the Imperium has faced, and 
survived it intact.  Yet, at that time, the conditions facing the 
Imperium were different.  The Imperium had just defeated a Zhodani-led 
coalition; neither the Zhodani nor the Vargr represented a serious 
threat.  There was no hostile Solomani Sphere to contend with. And there 
were no divergent interests within the Imperium; there was a commonality 
of purpose in integrating the Imperium into a whole.  The entire Civil 
War can be viewed as "normal" political intrigue, although perhaps a bit 
bloodier than the norm.

The Imperium no longer has that commonality of purpose.  The rimward 
domains have a natural interest in protection from the Solomani and the 
Aslan, while the area "behind the claw" has an equal interest in 
protection from the Zhodani, and the coreward areas from the Vargr.  The 
trailing areas are interested in expansion further trailing, and have 
concerns about K\'kree or Hivers.  The Imperial core and the areas 
bordering the Great Rift are increasingly isolationist, and concerned 
with local problems, which the Imperium refuses to address, as being 
local or internal matters.  Were simultaneous attacks on two fronts to 
happen, would the Imperium be able to pull together to meet the threat?  
Were an internal crisis to develop, such as the death of an Emperor 
without a clear heir, would the Imperium survive its own internal 
stresses?

It is only in unity that such a threat can be met, or even prevented.  
The unity that we have in name, but do not have in fact.  The unity that 
can be generated only by drastic changes in the way the Imperium relates 
to its member worlds.  It is time for the Imperium to abandon its 
hands-off policy with respect to local governments; to actively engage 
the local governments and the people of the Member Worlds in making 
their lives better; to be more responsive to the needs and desires of 
those same Worlds and those same people.

This will not be an easy change. It will involve major changes in the 
attitudes of much of the Imperial nobility, and may require that 
unresponsive nobles be relieved of their titles and responsibilities, 
and those given to others who can be counted on to work with the new 
order.  It will involve the restructuring - by force if necessary - of 
unrepresentative or oppressive governments of Member Worlds.  And it 
will require the devolution of some authority to lower levels, where 
responses to changing conditions can be made more quickly.  These 
changes must come from the top; there is little incentive for the Member 
Worlds to surrender sovereignty as would be required, and little 
incentive for the lower nobles to give up their power and prerogatives.  
Perhaps these arguments apply to the top levels as well - but it is only 
those top levels who can be expected to look to the benefit of the 
Imperium as a whole, and to decide wisely to that benefit.  Time grows 
short: We cannot know what may trigger the internal stresses into 
outright breaks, so we must act quickly to reduce those stresses, and 
bind the Imperium into a stronger whole.

I don\'t think there is anyway to do this in the digest at all, since you get one
mail that comprises the ptherwise individual posts.

If you were receiving the undigested form, as I am, its a simple matter to
set a mail filter to file all mail according to different criteria.  For
instance, I have 2 TML filters.

Filter one files any message with "traveller@mpgn.com" in the sender
to my TML folder.  Filter two moves a certain individuals posts directly
to my Trash folder.  I just set the filter to file mail from
"bif@annoyingperson.com" to the trash folder.

Of course, I remove my trash each mail session.

You can\'t imagine how peaceful the TML has been since I did that.
I mean, there are real posts that are on-topic.

Too true.  There are no new plots.  There are a couple of different works
that attempt to codify the possible plots.  A very comprehensive one,
albeit with many now obscure references, is

The Thrity-Six Dramatic Situations by Georges Polti

There is another modern book, not really worth much, called 20 Master Plots.
IIRC, G.B.Shaw also wrote something on this topic.

Let me amend my statement above:

The only new plots are in 101 Plots.

I\'ll take your word for it, but when I was in school, they said it was both
a fruit and a vegetable.  Guess I don\'t know what characteristics are
"vegetile."

Actually Chris, the above poster was referring to the M1A2 which has been
described elsewhere.  The M2A2 and M2A3 are later generation (than the M2A1
or just M2) Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV) which, along with the
M3A2 and M3A3 Cavalry fighting vehicles are described and pictured at;

http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/index.html

A site which will give you generally more information than you really want
about all modern land defense systems in the U.S. Inventory.

Oh, and they are not tanks, though they\'ve been known to play ones on TV News;)

Who is the Law on that planet?  If the common proletariat has put down the
previous regime, then has the law level changed?  There is still a law level
vs. social status relationship going on there that I think could be
codified.

He would still have a social status score.  Celebrities in this country are

Oy veh.  I won\'t even pretend to be able to keep up with that kind of thing.

I understand it may be very convenient for you.  But, I probably won\'t even
read the post if it says something like what you suggest.  I don\'t have
enough
MT knowledge or materials to participant in any knowledgeable way,
so, the more complicated, the more I lose interest.

A couple of thoughts:

Considering the intensive posting nature of the TML, each post will generate

so many reponses, and those responses will get responses, that you\'ll have a

huge geometrically expanding tree of posts.  A daunting task to integrate
and
keep straight.

Since it seems to me that what you want is similar to the kinds of public
debates that went on around the time of the American Revolution, with
pseudonyms, pamphlets, etc.,  I think you might be better off using a
web page system to post coherent responses.  For example: first,
Dulinor-In-Disguise posts Comment I.  Its on a webpage and the TML.
TML will by its very nature generate many picemeal responses and
healthy discussion.  Someone will post a full Response I.  (There may be
several).
(By full response, I mean a coherent reply that doesn\'t quote and respond to

pieces of the previous post).  These kind of full responses could then be
posted
to the webpage, so that on the webpage, you get a collection of statements
from the various viewpoints.  That site could be spiced up with juicy quotes

from the discussion on TML.

That way, at least on the website, you have editorial control and can keep
the quality high by pulling the signals out of the noise (even with this
lists
high signal to noise ratio).

Thanks for sending that link. Now I have at least a chance of following
some of these military topics. I have not been in the military and
have had little interest in modern warfare (until the players in my
Traveller game started out as retired militaries. This site is going
to be very helpful.

And where was said person held up to any high standard?  I bet he could get
away with it a second time, now that American women have decided its okay to
lie about sex.  (After all, they\'d lie to their husbands to get a crack at
the Prez.  Women find power so intoxicating.  They ought to take up
marksmanship, instead.)

And I\'m saying that the general, if he was a college buddy of the Prez,
might be above the law.  The powers that be could kill the story.  Or he
wouldn\'t even get so much as a censure thanks to some legal loophole that
two opposing attorneys found as they had martinis over lunch.

Ah, but the one set of laws *no one* is above is the laws of physics. Add
to this the philosophy of fanaticism and no one is safe unless they
themselves wish to live a very constricted life. I\'ll bet on the fanatic
assassin over money and political power anyday. *That\'s* the reason
behind
the "right to bear arms" in the U.S. Constitution.

BTW, folks, Clif\'s scenario was documented this morning in the Dallas
Morning
News. Apparently, a certain tycoon in Hong Kong will *not* be prosecuted
by the
Chinese government for crimes due to the "danger of her companies
failing".

Yeah, right.

All of the above may be true, but I think you missed the point - a PC\'s
social standing from off-planet may mean diddly to those in power on-planet,
while natives (with social standings no one a parsec away gives a damn
about) may have local power over life and death. Details like this, which
IMO will be pretty common, make a straight Soc vs something test a

the difficulty by one for No Law, and increase difficulty by one per

by one step, while protected classes (permits, appropriate social

 (This is based on world/cultural concepts.)  Suspicious activity, 
extenuating circumstances, and violent environment each increase the

Thus a reason for a President to be held to a higher standard than the
Gas Station Attendant. Right or wrong, a society may see things this way.
Add in some kind of technology that makes truth easy to discover
(like Pipers Veridicator(sp?) device from the Fuzzy series) and keepers
of the public trust may be holdable to whatever standards the people
deem appropriate. 

Imagine the trap a government could place itself in, if it lacked a few of
the rights we in the USA assume (esp rights against self-incrimination).
The gov\'t makes insistences on high moral standards, then someone
introduces a technology that allows these moral standards to be strictly
enforced. The gov\'t can\'t block use of the technology without losing
the moral high ground that gives them validity as government, so they
find themselves forced to behave as they\'ve been pretending to behave.
What a perfect fate for hypocrites...<eg>

I recall a book, _Hell\'s Pavement_ by Damon Knight (IIRC). Someone
developed a mind control machine, of course only to be used with the
subject\'s consent. Judges used it to make themselves be impartial in
court. Reporters used it to make themselves maintain professional
standards. Married couples used it to enforce their wedding vows.
If you haven\'t noticed yet, the book\'s title refers to the asphalt used for
the pavement on the road to Hell - Good Intentions.

That\'s an averaged rate, and wasn\'t borne out that well in Desert Storm.
Even if we assume near-parity between forces, your `10km a day\' might
need to be done in a small window of opportunity at 50kph, not trundling
along at half that.

And I bet you\'d then leave all your infantry and all your ATGMs behind

\'Thucydides\'

Gallatin would have an Imperium that interfered with the affairs of
individual worlds, that ran the very lives of the people it is presuming
to protect.

Gallatin forgets, that this was done before, that the entire history of
the First Imperium was a long, stifling attempt to to administer each
world as part of a unified whole, as he would.

The result of that was a rigid tyranny, that determined the very lives
of each and every subject of a god-like Emperor. It was a structure that
lasted for thousands of years, yet collapsed as though a rotten tree, at
the first puny push from the outside.

Cleon the First, in his wisdom, saw that such control was impossible
over interstellar distances without resorting to opressive tyranny. he
saw that the only path to a free, open Imperium lay in a policy of
protecting the member worlds from without, that they may forge their own
destiny free from threat of invason and subjugation.

Let us remember that the present Imperium, which has withstood events
that would have torn other empires asunder, has stood, simply because it
promotes the greater good of freedom to trade, freedom to grow, freedom
form fear: a limited promise from a limited government. 

It is because of those very freedoms that people may declare themselves
to be Vilani, Vilisthian, or a Vargr in the service of Duke Brzk, or
not. Were it not for this Imperium that _does nothing_ for the people,
they would be slaves under the bootheels of a myriad despots, huddled on
their own worlds, adrift one from the other, their children staring
hoplessly up at the unreachable stars, trapped in an ever lengthening
permanent Night.

OOC> I\'m not really sure which if any faction Thucydides belongs to or
speaks for, but this is very much a traditionalist view of Cleon\'s
Imperium. The evidence indicates that Strephon had decentralized the
Imperium considerably by stregthening the Archdukes; this would
represent a continuace of this model of the Imperium. 

However, it\'s also noted in canon, that Strephon was indeed interested
in Dulinor\'s thoughts...that\'s why he elevated the man to archduke in
the first place...None of the resulting factions of the Rebellion
espoused these ideas in toto, though Norris came closest, and even he
bowed to the inevitable and unified Deneb more than the Imperium had
been.

Call him the voice of History   ;-)

IMTU I also put high restrictions on combat robots etc. This is built into
the high level brains (most of their sentient like capabilities are
hardwired) and very hard to buy on the market. Criminals (and PCs) can
avoid this by programming DumBots to fight as the lowbrow brains cannot
understand what they\'re doing
- -"Point this rod at any moving heatsource with this size"
this can lead to interesting roleplaying situations
- -"Hey, don\'t point it at me!!!!"

I think most GMs in Trav will have to come up with a handwave for why so
much is still done by humans in Traveller. Especially astrogation seems a
field that would gain much by being robotized.

Easy: Every office worker, as soon as the building catches fire. I\'ve

Define `high thrust\'. I mean, in a 3G ship, your average human is going
to be nailed to the floor by the force. This isn\'t the transient G-
forces of a manoeuvring atmospheric fighter; it\'s a steady state force.
Even 2Gs will degrade the crew\'s ability to perform basic functions.

Basically, a perpendicular deck ship doesn\'t need artificial gravity if
it\'s always going to be thrusting it\'s engines at 1G. In any other case,
it should have artificial grav. Ditto inertial compensation, unless you
want the crew bouncing onto the floor/ceiling when you turn the engines
on/off

Well yes, but the Soviet/Russian/Eastern block forces are big on
combined arms too - indeed, there has been a lot of cross pollination
between the US and Russian doctrines. A BMP-3 does draw attention (not a
good think); but to be perfectly honest I\'d take a T-90 and BMP-3
combined arms force over a same size, same training force in M1A2s and
M2s. The T-90 is just scary; and the BMP-3 has more options available to
it than the Bradley while fixing a number of the problems with the
earlier models.

Anyway, I thought that HEAT was the favoured round for not-tanks.
Certainly our lot use HESH.

If you\'re busy with heavy armour, the supporting fire from a BMP-3 is
more of a problem then from a -2.

I see the Imperial Marines as a lot closer to the Marines in the days of
sail (shipboard security, boarding actions, limited landings) than
modern amphibious troops.

Depends. You an artist?

Seriously, if I ever get GT Infini-V working I\'ll be converting the
designs over to GT format, then reposting the book with _both_ sets of

You can. I just set up the security so you couldn\'t. Call me paranoid, but

I might be able to manage if there was money in it; otherwise, simply no
time.

On an amateur basis, I might be able to contribute a few pictures for the
vehicles I like, but then people who liked a certain vehicle WOULDN\'T like
it based on my illustration.

be provided to all worlds within Jump ___ on one page, within Jump ___ on

This would allow TRUE role-playing (though by email) and some use of the
computer and the web to speed things up.  Why describe what you can depict?

Then, whenever I wanted to play a solo adventure, I could take a passage to
another webworld and meet the NPC\'s and PC\'s (who happen to be there at the

world...

I think it would require work on our parts, but it would allow one world to
be developed in detail by one person.  The results would be varied.  The
responsibility for "dying" sites could be assumed by neighboring worlds.

Well Done Jesse!  As are the rest of the renderings on your site.  This is
exciting artwork, as good or better than anything Chris Foss came out with
relating to Traveller.  I especially appreciate the detail work - that Free
Trader looks like its been in a few dirty starports over the years.

This does, however, reinforce my belief that the Donosev is one of the
least attractive vessels in the canon Traveller Universe.  Only the
Leviathan is quite so chaotic in construction.  Not that I would change a
thing.

The decided on a slow tank because the Israelis are obsessed with crew
survival due to their small population base. These tanks have frontally
mounted engines as extra armor. Of course any frontal arc penetrations (and
some non-penetrating hits), wreck and/or dismount the engine resulting in a
mobility kill. The Israelis accept this as they rather lose the vehicle and
save the crew...This is also the reason that the Merkavas have the famous
"APC" capability. She has rear crew access doors for re-ammo-ing under fire.
This is MUCH better than passing rounds down through the TC or loaders\' hatch.
Somebody figured out that if you offload 80-90% of the main gun ammo, you can
squeeze four troopers into the ammo compartment. This isn\'t a pleasant
experience, but being uncomfortable is better than being dead, and the
Israelis do this when the M-113\'s are too vunerable. Needless to say, the
tankers are not thrilled to offload ammo...Run and Gun would work all right,
but I\'d HATE to have to assault them in prepared hull down positions. This is
what the Merkava was designed for; set piece British style defenses in the
Golan Heights; ie. hopping from one emplacement to another... In the southern
Negev-Sinai border with its\' rolling desert hills, the Israelis want more
speed, and I wouldn\'t be surprised if they got a license to build Abrams or
Leopard II\'s to replace their aging M60A3\'s...I would personally go with the
Abrams as it\'s got a proven desert track record in the Gulf...

This class of ship is a standard design which is widely available
within the Imperium.  Its class name indicates that its members are
named for stars or star-connected items.  Some ship names come from
major stars (Castor, Pollux, Deneb), minor stars (Wolf 359, Dreesen,
Fonteyn\'s Star), or stellar phrases or foriegn language terms (Per
Aspera, Ad Astra, Gwiazda, der Stern, Morning Star, Iruud).

Many shipyards produce subsidized liners.  Large corporations often
build their own in their shipyards.  Subsidy providers often specify
that construction takes place in a shipyard on their world.

One of the most prolific producers of the subsidized liner is Tukera
Lines, which has constructed most of the subsidized liners in Tukera
service.  Other well-known constructers include Osten Varn Slinten of
Fornast sector, and Allied Prefabricated Ship and Vessels of Magyar
sector.

Stellar class subsidized liners feature a sleek hull with pleasing
lines to appeal to passengers, although it is not streamlined and the
ship is incapable of entering atmosphere (though built in contra-grav
units will allow it skim fuel from gas giants or land; in an
emergency).  The most striking feature of the ship is the large saucer
located forward; it serves as a passenger lounge.  It can variously
outfitted as a dining salon, a dance floor, or an entertainment area,
as the need arises.  The deck is ringed by observation ports which
give passengers a wide view of space (shutters to control the ports
are controlled from the bridge).

I have a GT design for the Shivva I\'d already done before the GT
Aliens book was published. Let me know if you want me to post it, I
think it\'s a better design than the one SJG did (though I\'m biased, of
course) and is closer to the CT design. (It includes the 40 ton fuel
barge and 8 ton fighter (I called it the Shtelfire; did anybody else
read Scott (2G) Kellogg\'s Zhodani fiction?).

Me too. I have a lot of trouble with the ships presented in the
initial GT book.

Which isn\'t a problem to play with GT ship combat anyway...

Because it´s Microsoft Word???

PDF is better becUSE IT CAN BE VIEWED ON NEALY EVERY PLATFORM; (damn caps-lock)
and because it´s a defined standard. Mircosoft Word can´t even read itself sometimes.

The subject of starship aesthetics came up just recently in the
perpendicular-vs-parallel deck orientation thread, too -- and I\'d sort of
like to hear what different people think are attractive designs.  Not in
functional terms, since there\'s more than enough of that going around
already, but in terms of style & looks.  What do you like in the shape and
layout of a ship?  Do you think certain functional roles are better
"expressed" by a certain style of design?  Should certain states/species
have immediately distinctive ship designs?

I\'ve heard a lot of adjectives used in relation to "The 5th Element"

*NOT* one of them.

Yup, just exactly the same kind of neat whirring sound made by the

1) You can if it is enabled. It defaults to on so the author gets the final
chance. I\'m not sure if Rob enabled that feature.

2) Word sucks. Big clunky and platform dependent. We may as well use
ClarisWorks which is equally ubiquitous on the Mac. Arguing for RTF which
is sort of platform independent would have been more rational, but at least
Acrobat allows you to embed fonts and preserve the layout.

The writer(s?) was a visionary man, even if it was while he was dropping

Sorry, but I\'ve never heard one of these, and by the sound of what you\'re

The Ruby Rod ("Baton Rouge" my dad said), Red Dick character was pretty

You miss the point.  Novo Leningrad doesn\'t recognize Henrich\'s patent of
nobility as anything more than a confession of being an exploiter of the
masses.  Yes, in game terms, every single Comrade on the planet has a SOC
score, but in designing the culture, you need to determine who is above the
law.  Since I based Novo Leningrad on the USSR, it\'s the party that rules
things.  I know of no "people\'s revolutions" that ever put power in the
hands of the people.

Traveller rules are, by necessity, geared for the player-characters.  A
character with Soc-C will probably not enjoy his stay on Novo Leningrad,
since he will be by *law* stripped of most of the things he takes for granted.

Imagine a world where people with different colored eyes are held to be
holy.  The cannot be arrested, but are free to wander because it is
believed that one of their eyes is used by God.  A blue/hazel baby could be
born to an industrial giant or a poverty stricken family living under a
bridge.. that would be outside the law, but one would be SOC 10, the other
SOC 2.

That\'s Inquisitor Maximus, and don\'t you forget it!

You are comparing apples and oranges, and trying to compare a cultural
decision with a mechanical one.  *If* the world recognizes social rank as a
mitigating factor, the system provided works well.  It falls apart on any
world that doesn\'t fall in line with the European concept of nobility.

Combat, on the other hand, is a simple mechanical design issue.  No matter
the ideological bent of the rifleman, bullets are going to do predictable
things when they hit a target, and combat is something that can be reduced
to a well thought out, universal mechanic.

No, except within racial spheres, thus mirroring the design conventions of

Clif, would you like a list of the authors working in the 1930s and 40s
that "Fifth Element" ripped off?  Then entire movie\'s look was taken from
old issues of _Heavy Metal_, especially the work of Mobius.

As for the ears...  from _A Relic of Empire_, Larry Niven, first published
in the late sixties:

"Piracy was only the end product.  It started a year ago, when I found the
puppeteer system."
"The-"
"Yes.  The puppeteers\' home system."
Richard Mann\'s ears went straight up.  He was from Wunderland, remember?

Actually, add all of Niven\'s stuff to your to-read list.

Absolutely.  In fact, you don\'t actually hear the shots, just that constant
ripping noise.  Very impressive.

That was an effects depart with very little imagination told to "make him
look futuristic."  Which we all know means slap something on his head.

If you want visionary film SF, go rent _Silent Running_, _A Boy and His
Dog_, _2001: A Space Odyssey_, or, best of all for Traveller players, _Dark
Star_.

Don\'t stop there.  Use VRML and you can have 3D worlds
to explore and chat in.  Check out Colony City or
Starport C3 and you\'ll see what I mean.  A character\'s
avatar (3D puppet) can look like anything from people,
to robots, and beyond.  Built-in capabilities for
images, sounds, inter-active sensors, and such allow
for a plethora of special effects.

There are even servers that allow for multi-user
shared worlds.

Blaxxun has a demo VRML/chat server you can play with.
  http://www.blaxxun.com 

If you rather try 3D IRC instead, check out...
  http://www.attitudesoftware.com/

If your browser can view VRML (.wrl files), here\'s a
quick taste of what you can do without serious effort.

Remember, manuevers in space are *not* like manuevers in an aircraft or

is that the apparent direction of "down" will change *slightly*.

That\'s quite valid. And as a matter of fact, it just hit me that thios
is one of the reasons why ships prefer to jump while "coasting". If
they are under power, they\'ve got to balance the gravity against the
thrust. And as they enter jump, acceleration should drop to zero (even
if the drive is still on!). And it may not drop smoothly.[1]

But if you aren\'t under power, you just turn on the artificial gravity

Yeah, like wearing a sweater helps in an Antarctic gale. :-)

Oh Michael, if only you knew some of the plans floating around in my

showing up on my website and elsewhere on a near daily basis.  As it is, I\'m
stuck working basically on one machine (a PII-266 w/160megs) after work and
on the weekends.  Once I get ahead of the deadline curve for "First In"
there\'s definately a few things I\'d like to play around with.  This includes
a short .avi for fun of the opening sequence of Roger Barr\'s PBEM that I\'m
involved with, QTVR or RealPicture navigatable panoramas of ship interiors,
finishing my "real" Traveller page, and finally getting to start on
vacc-formed combat armor, among other things.

Oh well, maybe if I can win the lottery I could get an SGI Reality Engine
(render farm) for the loft with a couple of Octanes for working on.  I can

Well, since the Imperium is, in my opinion, terrans in space, I think that
most 3rd Imperium designs should look like they go "zoom".  I mean, what
are people gonna slap down Mcr300 to buy?  A borg cube?  No, a slick
looking fast ship...even if it actually moves like a borovian tree slug.

Saturn had it right; "I want a car that looks like it could actually take off."

I think different species should have radically different attitudes about
ship shape.  Hell, I think that different branches of Humaniti should see
ships differently.  Another poster suggested that the Donosev was a Vilani
design; Functional, no extra features.  Solomani design, on the other hand,
could have tailfins like a 50\'s Cadillac.  Even different manufacturers
could have distinctive features thay are known for;

"Hey, is that a female humanoid on the nose of that scout ship?"

"No, That\'s Hortalez et Cie\'s idea of ornamentation."

Layout is a little harder to talk about quickly, and since I need to go
pick someone up now...

See ya.

OK, here\'s some of my (random) thoughts on the subject.

There aready exists certain racial / species traits to their general ship
designs.  These are the ones I can think of off the top of my head without
my books here at work:
1.The aforementioned Vilani.  Tend to be simple, utilitarian designs.
They\'ll get you there, but you won\'t look good doing it.  The sub-merchant
is a Vilani design.
2.Everybody and their mother KNOWS when a Vargr ship shows up on their
screens.  That\'s because of the racial tendencies to have spiky, garishly
striped ships.
3.The Aslan ships tend to be very blended, rounded shapes, with intricate
characters engraved or painted on the ships.  Their lanthanum grids tend to
be shaped in these characters as well.
4.Hivers.  IIRC they tend to be borg cube style, i.e. plain boxes.
5.The Darrians use airframed vehicles exclusively (or nearly).  This is due
to their racial fear of another Maghiz-type event, where the electronics of
everything airborne at the time went out and everything in the air dropped
like a brick and crashed.

- ----

I tend to like the swoopy, airframed style of ships (witness my Acipiter
Class and it\'s siblings), at least for PC groups.  In an emergency you can
attempt a dead stick landing with them ala the Darrians.  Also useful if
you\'re in atmosphere and the bad guys destroy your manuever and cg drives,
which I\'ve done to players before >:)

For the bulk freight carriers, I\'ve always aesthetically liked the cargo
pods on a spine look.  The modular concept of the cargo pods makes sense to
me for rapid ship turnaround.  No cargo hold to worry about, just lock the
containers onto the grapples, fuel up, and go.

Warships, IMHO, should just plain LOOK nasty to deal with.  Fear factor is
not irrelevant, especially if you flash a picture at the PC\'s and say "This
just showed up in front of you".  Done that too :)

Then there\'s always the freaky alien things to throw at your characters, as
witnessed by the Annic Nova and the time I threw a Predator ship at my
players >:D  OK, so it wasnt\' very imaginative, but it was fun.

Well, the point is that flares are pretty common. At least a few times
a year ships moving to and from the 100 diameter limit are going to be
exposed to a flare.

On the other hand, someone has found a reference that gives TL12 and
higher ships decent shielding.

It\'s more complicated than that. There\'s radiation from the star, but
flares are an exceptional situation. Sort of like the difference
between wind and a tornado. 

So what we need are some tables for determining how "active" a star is.
That is how often and how strong it\'s flares are. That will take
spectral class into account. The result would be a permanent detail for
the star. 

Then, once you have the base activity level, you\'d roll on a table to
see if there was a flare, and how powerful it is. The base activity
level would likely be a modifier on this roll. 

And technically, you\'d be rolling for *direction* of the flare. A lot
of flares occur but go nowhere near Earth. I\'d handle that by having
tow sets of tables. One for when you are dealing with the whole system

Hmm.  What passes for salsa in your neck of the woods, I don\'t really want
to know.  FWIW, my ketchup does not contain onions, jalapenos, or cilantro.

Certainly.  First, by now you\'ll have seen the "Rules of
Engagement".  That\'s the "mechanical" issues.  The debate itself
is "in-persona", that is, the participants are not Gregorian XXc
readers of the Traveller Mailing List, but are persons (probably
of some significance) in the Third Imperium, circa 1116.  The
question put, in essence, is "Does the Imperium need a new
direction, and if so, what is that direction?"  This debate
started in some Imperium-wide publication that the movers and
shakers all can reasonably be expected to read, anonymously.  It
is a good idea for participants to select a pseudo for use in the
debate; one may write in the debate as one imagines that Blaine
Tukera might, but should not sign the posts as "Blaine Tukera";
choose instead an pseudonym, perhaps "Adam Smith".  Of course,
there need be no connection between your POV and the significance
of your pseudo.

Good references:  For the form of the debate, see the Federalist
and AntiFederalist Papers, containing a similar debate over the
recently-proposed Constitution of the United States of America;
for the background of the debate, the best references are
_Survival_Margin_ and _Rebellion_Sourcebook_, although I
distinctly recall articles in either Challenge or Traveller\'s
Digest providing more information on specific factions.

Actually, I\'m enjoying the challenge.  There\'s certainly no
prohibition on multiple participants supporting the same
position, although I would hope that not everyone will choose the
same "side" in the debate.

The thing to remember here is that the Point of Departure is that
Dulinor did _not_ decide to assassinate Strephon, but instead
chose to start this debate.  That suggests a slightly different
personality than in the canonical Traveller and GURPS Traveller
universes.  This is a debate on a future direction for the
Imperium, and it will ultimately be up to Strephon whether any of
the proposed directions are followed.  (This could also be the
"root" of yet another Imperial timeline; the question becomes
what kind of adventuring becomes possible in it.)

>You wanna be Brzk?  Stay with Dulinor (and i\'ll be the Duke of Verge or
>someone).  Or who, in the era of IY 1116, do you most identify your personal

Actually, I\'ll be taking two positions in this debate; Dulinor
("Gallatin") and Norris ("Dilgaadin").  I see the two as largely
compatible, given Norris\'s actions subsequent to the closure of
Deneb\'s borders - but in a sense, Norris is far more radical than
Dulinor.

I\'d like to see others take different positions - it\'s almost a
sure bet that the Archduke of Sol or someone speaking for the
Vegan Autonomous District will support Strephon; Bzrk and others
from that region may very well support a policy of _external_
engagement; the Vilani will almost certainly argue for the status
quo of the past thousand years, or perhaps argue for
restructuring along the lines of the Ziru Sirka, and so on.
There are many viewpoints available; there are many people on
this list - plenty of room in the pool for everyone.

The rest of your article, I\'ll not comment on; it\'s more
appropriate to take it into the persona debate.

One can get an outline of Dulinor\'s position from
_Survival_Margin_ and _Rebellion_Sourcebook_.  I think there was
also at least one article in either Challenge or Traveller\'s
Digest that discussed Dulinor\'s plans, but I can\'t locate it at
the moment.  Beyond what\'s there, it\'s simply going to be the
writer\'s interpretation of the person\'s views - and that will be
true for all participants in the debates.

Actually, the only reason I\'d like this is so that I can build
the archive that you suggest.  The best key here is the string
"[Debate]"; the rest is, strictly speaking, optional, though it
would make things easier when we get to the point that there are
multiple threads originating with the same post.

Which is why the subject lines I suggested will help.  It will be
a major bear if everything has a subject line of "[Debate]
Dulinor\'s Views" or some such...

This _will_ be incorporated into Freelance Traveller (the
Speakers\' Corner), as soon as I find another site to mirror it at
- - I\'ve been blindsided from two directions at once, as NeoTown
appears to be down hard, and I just got a note from the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Brooklyn that Execnet has sevened.

Fortunately, I have a copy of the site on my own machine, and I
own at least three places that I can post it, at the cost of
losing the use of the Feedback and Ask Freelance Traveller pages
- - which would apparently be no great loss, judging from how
little they\'re actually used, but...

I haven\'t decided whether to include - or even recognize -
discussion on the debate that\'s not in-persona.  It\'s somewhat
contrary to the intent, and I\'m not sure that it can easily be
made to "fit".  But I\'ll think about it...

Actually, the son of the high party member has a lesser chance of even
being arrested. He\'ll be well known, and if a rookie cop goes to arrest
him the odds are good that another cop will pull him aside and warn
him. And if *that* doesn\'t happen, you can be sure that the son will
inform him. 

You know, the standard "Do you know who I am?" bit. And at least in the
Soviet system, the odds are rather good that he\'d be believed, possibly
having to show his ID. The system was so rigid that the mere fact of
standing up to authority was strong evidence that you *did* have high
status.

There\'s also the equivalent of "national security". Those cute "get out
of jail free" cards that the CIA used to give people in Vietnam[1].
They read something like:

	The bearer of this card is not to be interfered with
	in ANY way and is to be rendered any and all
	assistance.		XXX-XXXX

That last was a phone number to confirm things with. 

Strictly speaking, those cards are *not* legal. Nor is a lot of other
stuff that gets swept under the rug in the name of national security.

A much older example is the "carte blanche" Cardinal Richilieu gave to
Milady deWinter. Again, the legality is *highly* debatable. But in
*practice* NO ONE will argue the point.

[1]You used to be able to buy reproductions from ads in Soldier of
Fortune. I don\'t know if you still can, but they\'d make a good starting
point for a prop, as well as being fun to show people.

For the folks playing GURPS, it\'d *definitely* be a major advantage.
Notoriety or some such. It\'s not *merely* "social". It\'s a "Who YOU

Ah.

Well, that depends on the type of universe you run. Mostly on where it
falls on the scale of "rule of law" vs "rule of men".

And 2001: was so realistic that I can\'t see how it would be called
"visionary", except for HAL, which is just techno-fear blown-up.  I would
call 2001:  a landmark in film-making, yes; a masterful work of art, yes,
but I don\'t know about visionary.

I guess by visionary I am thinking "different", since you can use your own
eyes to see things that are the same.  Visionary men use what some term "the
mind\'s eye".

This is a really good look. I also personally like the "large trailer" 
look of some cargo haulers I\'ve seen. A small living space and HUGE 
drives with the ability to hook up one or more pods.

Fellow Citizens,

	Our old and glorious Imperium is a thing of wonder.  We enjoy wealth,
stability and more than our share of justice and peace.  Yet all these things
aside, it is a thing of wonder because it gives all sophonts their best
opportunity to enjoy liberty.
Furthermore, it is two policies that give this gift of liberty to the citizens
of the Imperium, namely, the Imperium\'s insistence on control of the
spacelanes, and it\'s policy of allowing member worlds to manage their own
affairs without Imperial interference.
	"How can you say this," you might ask "when local governments can be
tyrannical and non-responsive to the needs of the people."    Ha!  The
citizens of our  empire possess a powerful "right to vote" that can nullify
any local government\'s policy.   That right to vote is the right to move,
i.e., the right to vote with one\'s feet.  As long as the empire controls the
spacelanes and the extraterritorial starports, any citizen who can scrape
together 1000cr can become a Traveller and find himself a new home and a new
way of life.  The Imperial Ministry of Colonization supports this right in
other ways, giving those in need an opportunity to start afresh.
	Compare the fate of sophonts in other realms of space to those in the
Imperium.  If a Zhodani citizen rejects Zhodani culture or government, he is
considered mentally ill and is reeducated.  If a Solomani citizen rejects the
Solomani Cause, he is considered a traitor to the race.  If a K\'kree takes up
a desire for meat, he is an abomination.  If an Aslan rejects the clan system,
he is an outcast with nowhere to go.  The Hivers make it a practice to
manipulate every aspect of culture and society, from which an individual Hiver
has no escape. As for Vargr, well, they\'re Vargr after all.
	Our Imperium offers us a staggering range of diversity of culture, ideology
and opportunity.  It gives the citizen the chance to find a place of his own,
a culture of his own, a home of his own.   The day the "Ministry of Education"
or "Ministry of Cultural Compliance" begins to alter worlds and local systems,
"for the good of the people" of course, we will have lost something
irreplaceable.  
	When the Emperor or some "elected body" is given the power to interfere with
a world for a good cause, it gains that same power to do so for an evil one.
The Imperium will become more and more uniform.  The Imperium will become more
and more stagnant.  The citizen will become more and more constrained.  In
fact, when the Imperium abandons the "rules the space between worlds and not
the worlds" policy it invites the return of the stagnating vices of the First
Imperium.  Have you learned nothing?
	The path the Imperium is on now is the right one.  It is the path of choice.
It is the path of opportunity.  It is the path of open horizons for the common
man.  It is the way of Liberty.

Hey, that was cool!  I guess IE 4.0 must be able to view VRML, though when I

then it came back, those I had to reconnect to AOL IM and ICQ.

Actually, it\'s not that hard to tie almost *any* of her books together.
For example, in "Beast Master" a set of gardens in a cave system are
found (Forerunner stuff). Well, one of the gardens has a tree bearing
Astran "golden apples", which ties that series to the Pax/Astra stuff.

Likewise, several other stories refer to the "Caverns of Arzor" (the
caves I mentioned above). I actually managed to tie "Beast Master" to a
story where earth *wasn\'t* burned off with only a couple of
intermediate links. :-)

Norton wasn\'t that careful about re-using references. So it\'s best to
consider all her SF to be the *same* universe, except for the few
details that conflict. Well, all of them but the Croostime stories and
the Ross Murdoch ones. 

> Dread Companion

For the folks who don\'t remember, this one has the rather odd little
girl and her brother. The "hero" is a girl hired to be their "nanny".
They get transferred to a new world and on an outing the girl opens a
gate to another "place" which may be the basis of the legends of
elf-hills.

> Star Man\'s Son (also known as Daybreak 2250 AD or Star Man\'s Son 2250 AD)

One of the better "after the nuclear war" stories from its period.

If I thought I was good enough, I\'d ask for permission to do a GURPS
sourcebook of her SF. Getting her to fill in the blanks on her various
races and the like before she dies is something that would be a
wonderful legacy for future readers and gamers.

I also like the idea of a universe with Zacathans, the "bird" species I
can\'t rember the name of and all the minor races such as the Salariki. 
A *great* starting point for a campaign would be a few generations
after "Star Rangers". Re-expanding from an earth that now has some
aliens as well as humans on it...

You do recall correctly.

Also, the Apollo service module would *probably* have provided enough
"shadow shielding" for a flare. The real danger period (as at least one
TV movie showed) was while they were on the surface of the moon. A
*big* flare then, with a rapid rise time, could get them before they
could get back to the Lunar Module and rendezvous with the CSM.

In the movie, they\'d been pretty far out using the lunar rover. And
when they finally got back to the LM, the radiation has affecting them
enough that the pilot crashed it on takeoff. As was shown all too
clearly by the camera they\'d erected when they first set up on the
surface. 

Leaving the remaining astronaut to break orbit and head home alone. And
feel guilty for the rest of his life. :-(

Anybody remember that movie? 

BTW, the Apollo missions are the *only* manned missions to go beyond
low earth orbit.

Also, Heinlein goes into it in "The Rolling Stones". And Lee Corey (the

The most recent Russian APC has a 120mm smoothbore. Only difference
between it and the ones on their tanks is that the barrel is shorter.
That probably makes it more of a target, but on the other hand, it also
means that when they have to shoot at tanks, they actually have a
chance! :-)

I think the point they were trying to make is that social level is a
*lot* more relative than the game implies. A "noble" visiting a
"People\'s Republic" is going to be treated as having a *low* social
status whenever the locals can get away with it.

Ditto for a "People\'s Commisar" visiting a lot of other places.
Official government representatives will be somewhat immune to this.
But the less important their post, the more likely they are to get the
normal (bad) treatment.

It\'ll still break its back. Also, consider the loading on the landing
gear. Making retractable gear for something that heavy is gonna be
interesting. The stresses on the gear for a tail sitter require lighter
gear.

The folks who write those blurbs are notorious for not even knowing

<sigh>

I said "Delta-X" because the Delta Clipper does not exist (and isn\'t
likely to now). The sequences was going to be:

1. Build Delta-X
2. test to destruction (yes *they *expected that it\'d get destroyed
   *somewhere* in the process of testing)
3. analyse data, especially that regarding what destroyed it.
4. Build Delta-Y (bigger, maybe manned) modifying design using info
   from step 4.
5. test to destruction
6. analyze data, especially that regarding what destroyed it.
7. Build Delta Clipper (full size, fully functional SSTO)
8. test
9. put into service
10. *if* there\'s a Delta Clipper failure, redesign around failure or
    redefine flight paramters to avoid problem.
11. goto 8

Also, in a starport, you\'ll have "blast pits". You\'ll land with the
nozzles almost in the pit, which carries away the exhaust. After
cutoff, you extend a steel grating across the pit so that you won\'t
have to go fishing in the pit if you drop a part or a tool.

I prefer the "rounded cone" design. I also expect that landing legs
will come in sets of 6, just in case. You\'d need two *adjacent*
failures to have trouble.

One question:  Are the participants expected to play the personae of
_canonical_ movers-and-shakers circa 1120, or are participants free to
speak with the voices of the powerful in their campaigns (assuming that
said campaigns are set in the 3I circa 1120)?

Funny, I agree with the assessment of Heinlein\'s later works and like you
Pete I read the newer stuff just because...Star Ship Troopers was the very
first science fiction book I ever read (I was 26 at the time) and I was
hooked from then on.  I just classed them as another genre\' that fit into
the fast food catagory.  My vote for my favorite is Star Ship Troopers, yea
yea I know...still don\'t change my OPINION though.  BTW, I also loved the
Stainless Steel Rat series by Harry Harrison and his book that the movie
"Blade Runner" was based on.

The problem is that expert systems are only as good as the data. The
problem isn\'t the expert system. It\'s the sensor system that lets the
robot *identify* the damage. 

Also, a new weapon that creates a "unique" type of damage will fall
right through the "damage types list".

Neural nets are the *perfect* example. You see, they aren\'t
"programmed". They are *trained*. Sure, you can then copy the trained
net into a new system. But the trouble is that without spending
*enormous* amounts of time analyzing the net, you don\'t know what the
"rules" it has "learned" are. Not that it matters, since you can\'t
change the rules themselves.

Neural nets have the *same* shortcomings as people, as well as the
disadvantage of not being able to easily be told "No! You\'ve reached
the wrong conclusion!".

It also takes a lot of time to train the nets. And there\'s no guarantee
that they\'ll learn what you want. They\'ll learn the right responses to
the "test" situations (though even that can go wrong). But you can\'t
guarantee that they\'ll respond correctly to a "similar" situation that
they *weren\'t* trained on.

If you\'re referring to the BMP-3, it has a 100mm gun-launcher, capable
of firing either a conventional round or an ATGM.  Since no FSU 100mm
round can penetrate the front armor of an M1-series tank, I would expect
the ATGM to be similarly futile against the front of an M1.  (BTW, no
current FSU/Russian tank carries a 120mm gun.  T-64/T-72/T-80/T-90/T-90+
tanks carry a 125mm smoothbore gun, which is much less effective than
the 120mm Rheinmetall gun carried by the M1A1/M1A2, the Leopard 2, and
(IIRC) the LeClerc, or the 120mm rifled gun on the Challenger series of
British tanks.

debate, I tried to avoid letting my biases leak in too much.  I
attempted to summarize the views of the respective sides, without
judging directly my opinion of their validity.  Having said that, I
suggest that the following points might help resolve the debate (or at
least tone it down):

1.  Compact hull forms (spheres, cubes, etc.) are almost always best
designed as perpendicular-deck (hereafter perp-deck) ships.

2.  Elongated hull forms (needles, wedges, cylinders, etc.) may be
either parallel-deck (hereafter para-deck) or perp-deck, depending on
size and function of the ship in question.

3.  Ships of elongated hull form which are expected to spend significant
amounts of time on planetary surfaces, or within planetary atmospheres,
will be more likely to have para-decks than ships of similar hull form
which are not expected to spend much time in situations where a planet\'s
gravity is a significant influence on items within the ship\'s hull. 
Ships in the second category will have either para-deck or perp-deck
designs, depending on the function of the design, and the biases of the
architect.

4.  Elongated hull form ships of smaller size are more likely to have
para-decks, in order to ensure that each deck is of useful size.  In
other words, if the deck plan of a given perp-deck design cannot
accommodate various routine installations (bridge, individual
staterooms, etc.) on a single deck, while the deck plan of a para-deck
design can accommodate these installations on a single deck, then the
para-deck design has a better chance for approval by the purchasing
authority (whoever that may be).  On larger ships [first guesstimate: 
1000 Dtons or larger], most typical installations will fit on one deck,
and thus this factor will not be significant.  Since compact hull form
ships have fairly similar height/length/width dimensions, this
consideration is less likely at all ship sizes to be a factor in deck
configuration considerations.
 
5.  Vilani-influenced designs will tend to be compact hull forms, and
thus will normally be perp-deck designs.

6.  Solomani-influenced designs will tend to be elongated hull forms,
and thus may be either perp-deck or para-deck designs.

7.  None of the above paragraphs is definitive.  Individual architects
can feel free to deviate from these parameters as they see fit.

I have deliberately ignored the factor of inertial
compensation/artificial gravity, as the reliability of these
technologies is largely an "IYTU" issue.

Sorry Thom, but "Blade Runner " was based on the book "Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep" by Phillip K. Dick (Who also had his stories "We Can
Remember It For You Wholesale" and "Screamers" made into movies. "We Can
Remember It For You Wholesale"  came out as the movie "Total Recall"). I
would like to know what Harry Harrison book you think "Blade Runner" was
based on.

	My answer for why so much is done the way it is in Traveller is social
inertia.  It is done this way, it has ALWAYS been done this way.   I
explained this to my players before we started.  Traveller is big clunky
equipment in space.  If you go for complete automation, advanced robotics
and cyberware it would be another game.

	Distributing files in Word format would be a VERY bad idea. (IMO)  Word is
going to be a much more specialized format.  It is not going to be
supported on as many platforms.  If you use a new version of Word it is not
backward compatible.  Word files are subject to virus infestation.  PDF
files are multi platform.  You can copy and paste from them if the security
is set to allow it.  PDFs are also easier to get to print on different
paper sizes which can be important.

	There are ways around PDF security.  When this discussion started I spent
about 5 minutes checking.  I already knew the document security is
dependent on the viewer.  If someone wants to write a viewer that does not
support security they don\'t have to support it.  This having been said you
CAN extract the text from a protected PDF document.  Ghostscript with the
right addons will do it.  I have had people tell me some of the Linux
viewers have not implemented security. (Not verified at my end.)   There
are some projects on the net to crack the password.  Generally though, I
don\'t see a real reason to worry about it.  If you are using the
information in what could be construed as fair use, type it into another
document.  Rob Prior has a very valid point for not allowing people to copy
& paste from the files he has provided for FREE (Thanks).

themselves. We see a bureacracy which holds secrecy and conformity as the 
greatest of virtues. We see those who dare to speak out struck down by 
assassins in the night. This is not an Empire governed by honour and law, this 
is a depotism ruled by fear and expediancy.

Nor are our citizens ignorant of these things, despite the best efforts of many of 
those who hold power. Every year see\'s a call for change, every year see\'s 
some of those who call grow disillusioned and turn to violence. Behind the 
mask of stability lurks the spectre of bloody rebellion. How often have we seen 
the obvious potential of a junior member of the Imperial house wasted to avoid 
any potential rival to succession? How often have we seen a voice of reasoned 
change cut down only to be replaced by a demagog calling for revolution? How 
often have we seen blatant corruption or injustice ignored in the name of 
expediancy?

It is time to put an end to this self imposed blindness. It is time to move 
beyond the shakles of the Warrant of Restoration and move to a government 
based on sound legal and democractic principles. We are eleven hundred years 
removed from Cleon I, and we have likewise outgrown this scrap of paper. Now 
many will claim that this is lunacy or herecy or both. Why should we throw 
away the foundation of an Empire which has lasted more than one thousand 
years? I say the question is not why, but when. The Warrant lays at the very 
heart of our current maliase. The Warrant provided an excellant foundation to 
rebuild civilisation and roll back the curtans of the Long Night, it provided simple 
certainty and did not challange those entrenched in power. Its simple 
expediancy allowed for civilisation to return. However it could never be more 
than an interim constitution; it allows those very despots who it did not threaten 
to remain, it builds a government on the whims of a single person (and we need 
look no further than Cleon III to see where that can lead), and above all it allows 
for no disention or dispute. The Imperium is rotten at its very core, its 
foundations are built in sand. Without change the question is not will the 
Empire fall but when.

That reminds me of one of my all-time favourite jokes. It\'s from an episode
of Rowan Atkinson\'s _The Thin Blue Line_ where this young supercillious
upper-class twit who has just been brought into the police station leans
across the desk and sneers at the desk sergeant: "Do you know who my
father is?". And the sergeant replies completely dead-pan: "I\'m afraid I
can\'t help you there, Sir. Have you tried asking your mother?"

GURPS is not really oriented to random character generation; as you know
it\'s a point-build system with the emphasis on designing rather than
randomizing character design.  However, there was an article describing 
semi-random Traveller chargen in Pyramid (www.sjgames.com/pyramid/). 
(Basically, build a low-point value character and then run it through a
random system equivalent to the basic Traveller career system.

> Also, does GURPS Traveller have careers?

The G:Traveller book does have templates from many careers, but you\'re not
required to use them.  If you can imagine a character concept, you can
probably build it (assuming you have the points).

How about we tell you what\'s good about it instead?  Some of us actually
like it.  I think it does a very good job of capturing the feel of
Traveller and couples it with a very playable rules system.

You may also want to download GURPS Lite, a free PDF version of the basic
GURPS rules.  It\'s on the SJGames site somewhere.  (www.sjgames.com)

Well, it was written by Harlan Ellison.

For Traveller use, you could use the culture and setting for a devastated

Which brings up two points:

We\'ve seen in the last few years that many leaders and countries are
willing to perform in ways that invite retaliation.  Iraq has continued to
frustrate UN inspection teams, and lock on to US warplanes.  The threat
(and action) of retaliatory air strikes doesn\'t seem to faze them.

Perhaps Baron Chumley would have a "get out of jail free" card, but the
Party propaganda masters would play up the evils inherent in the system.
How dare an accident of birth allow this criminal to go free!  Chumley
would also probably be asked to leave the planet and never return, which
could be bad if Chumley happened to be Baron Novo Leningrad!

The other concept is diplomatic immunity.  In the modern day, diplomats and
their families and staffs are immune from legal prosecution in the country
they are working in.  This prevents the host nation from taking revenge on
the diplomats for the actions of their nation.

In the Third Imperium, who would have Immunity?  As I see it, Nobles who
actually do the Imperium\'s work would carry diplomatic passports, along
with their families and staff.  The Baron of Efate would be immune as long
as he was inside the Imperium and doing the Emperor\'s business.  Now, let\'s
say that the Baron committed a heinous crime.  The government of Efate
could petition the Baron\'s superior (in this case Norris) for relief and
the freedom to try the Baron.  This privilege would not be given lightly,
since it opens up the nobility to a great deal of scrutiny.

ACQ is currently being edited by that lovely BITS crew, and should be
avalible for purchase in a few months.

ACQ does not use a hit-location system, but instead gives increased damage
for attacks that roll five below and ten below the target number (double
and triple damage, respectively.)

A large tank of cleaning fluid?

Since anything that I remember about neutrinoes means that several metres
of superdense won\'t affect the sensor activity, an armoured sphere should
be fine (armoured as in ship\'s normal hull)

To get direction information, you probably need an array of these spheres.

The detectors probably have some nuclear damper technology involved
(though its weak force control not strong force that is required)
but I cannot see any reason for putting these outside the armour.

The problem for the artist is that none of this technology actually
requires detectors on the surface of the ship - right in the middle sould
work just as well.

Oops!

Reason two makes no sense. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Take a look at the Kinunir and the Broadsword. Both have small craft
that dock internally, and the small craft have a length that is a significant
fraction of the longest axis of the ship.

The Kinunir has decks paralell to thrust, and the small craft docks paralell
to thrust. You can open the entire side of the pinnace onto one deck,
accessing the entire cargo bay at once. The small craft bay is confined
to one deck, which I see as a design and layout plus. Of course, Kinunir
lands sometimes...it\'s nice to have the Pinnace able to shut off artificial
grav while the ship is landed.

The Broadsword has decks perpendicular to thrust, and the small craft
dock paralell to thrust. You have to access the cutter\'s bridge from the
Broadsword\'s bridge deck, the drives from the lowest deck, and the cargo 
from several decks (actually from open bays several decks high). 
Not to mention that thecargo bay is rotated 90 degrees from the cargo 
access area of the cutters - you have to load and service the
ATV\'s either in zero G, or while the ATV is sitting on it\'s tail. Not to mention
the fact that the forward part of the cutter\'s cargo bay is about ten meters
off the deck you access it from. Though the M.C. Escher-ish view of
people walking along the spiralled grav plates in the docking tube might
be a bit disconcerting to those unfamiliar with space travel...<G>

This is less relevant for ships that are just tossing docking tubes between

ship to do some commando work on a backwater planet and don\'t want
it seen. Would you rather it sat on it\'s tail, or on it\'s side? The latter seems
easier to hide.

Put all the shirtsleeve stuff together in the middle of the ship and it\'s
easier to circulate air and heat, so move the stuff that doesn\'t require
shirtsleeves to the outside.

Another reason to have them on the outside is easy replacement. This
ship is a sensor platform, she probably gets the latest sensor upgrades
as soon as the IISS can afford them. It may be easier to have all the
sensors on external, easy to swap pods rather than having to rip things
out of the core of the ship.

Take a look at the Kinunir and the Broadsword. Both have small craft
that dock internally, and the small craft have a length that is a significant
fraction of the longest axis of the ship.

The Kinunir has decks paralell to thrust, and the small craft docks paralell
to thrust. You can open the entire side of the pinnace onto one deck,
accessing the entire cargo bay at once. The small craft bay is confined
to one deck, which I see as a design and layout plus. Of course, Kinunir
lands sometimes...it\'s nice to have the Pinnace able to shut off artificial
grav while the ship is landed.

The Broadsword has decks perpendicular to thrust, and the small craft
dock paralell to thrust. You have to access the cutter\'s bridge from the
Broadsword\'s bridge deck, the drives from the lowest deck, and the cargo 
from several decks (actually from open bays several decks high). 
Not to mention that the cargo bay is rotated 90 degrees from the cargo 
access area of the cutters - you have to load and service the
ATV\'s either in zero G, or while the ATV is sitting on it\'s tail. Not to mention
the fact that the forward part of the cutter\'s cargo bay is about ten meters
off the deck you access it from. 

This is less relevant for ships that are just tossing docking tubes between
each other, as the tube can either be in zero-G or have grav plates in 
it that gradually adjust "down" so you walk from one ship to the other
easily, even if the two ships are using different deck orientations. Though
the M.C. Escher-ish view of people walking along the spiralled grav plates in 
the docking tube might be a bit disconcerting to those unfamiliar with space 
travel...<G>

Hmmm, I just thought of another reason for paralell-to-thrust deckplans

It\'s not that I don\'t want people to use the material. (If that was the

It\'s that I want to ensure that I get credit for my work.  Ever since my
first Internet exploration revealed one of my Traveller programs, with
someone else\'s name attached, I\'ve been touchy about this. The flaming I

Depending on yield, but probably in this range.  As a rule of thumb, figure
that secondary blast effects (from the primary beam vaporizing things) are
comparable to one kilo of TNT per 5-10 megajoules of beam energy; the low-end
values are appropriate for meson accelerators and other weapons that are
efficient at creating explosions, the high-end value for lasers and the like.

Limited by atmospheric effects, but if you\'re firing _down_ through atmosphere
accuracy is unlikely to be a problem (firing the other way is likely to
substantially degrade accuracy).

Nah.  Just determine if the ship is overhead, give the PC on the ship a sensor
task to locate the truck, a pretty easy gunnery task to shoot the truck, and
assume the truck disappears if hit.  Then have the PCs unable to find the bad
guy\'s bodies ;)

a 95-Mj laser will do about 43d6 damage to whatever it hits, with a beam
about a meter wide.  That\'s a pretty standard merchant ship laser.

Since missiles are nuclear weapons, the smallest of them is a 10kt nuke.
This is one reason why IMTU missiles are exclusively military weapons.

I\'ll tell the guy who writes me weekly asking about Lunion that you\'ve made

To be honest, I work in a very piecemeal fashion.  In one session in front

write-up, and play a lot of Nethack before I get to what I was supposed to
be doing.  When I try to force myself, I\'m never satisfied with the result.

Nah, \'destroying\' atmosphere won\'t happen.  You\'ll ionize the atmosphere and
create secondary effects near the beam path comparable to a lightning bolt,

No more so than a violent lightning strike. There will be a heckuva BANG
as the laser superheats the air it\'s going through, but it doesn\'t
\'destroy\' the air, merely heats it to a plasma state.

In fact it would probably look remarkably like a very straight lightning
bolt.

The foundations of skyscrapers prevent them from sinking into the ground.
Foundations do not provide lateral bracing, and could cause significant
damage to the surroundings in high winds or earthquakes if they did. This
has been gone over in excruciating detail previously.

Elevator shafts are more effective fire barriers than corridors because the
shafts are interrupted by elevator cars, unless the corridors have fire
doors every few dozen meters and slow traffic even more.

Or do you mean that workers in a building on fire with corridors would jump
out the windows instead of using the elevator or corridor? The desirability
of this depends on how high the building is off the ground and has nothing
to do with how the corridors happen to be laid out. Moreover, this option
is hardly relevant for starship crews.

You are truly fortunate if you have never had to wait for a corridor;
managing human traffic is a significant problem in many buildings like
schools, theaters, airports, and sport arenas. People often have to wait
for an opening in a corridor when pedestrian flows intersect or at blind
intersections. This can happen even in low-occupancy buildings which are
poorly designed. For example (pretends to think hard), that spot outside
the bridge of the Sulieman-class scout/courier where 3 doorways open into
the same hex. One from the floor. That must be real interesting in an
emergency.

I specifically stated a 1 G acceleration in my message. I agree that
inertial compensation has advantages outside of providing artificial
gravity; another poster mentioned it is necessary for jump travel.

However, in all these cases perpendicular decks are preferable because you
don\'t have to spend effort conteracting the normal operation of your ship
drives. Every G that frees up can be used for more artificial gravity, ship
acceleration, or lower costs.

knows, beyond a shadow of a doubt (see: Mr Pulver).  Because, to 
be quite honest, I don\'t know anymore.

GURPS Traveller turrets.  

If I have a turret and load three weapons on it, how many spaces 
does it take up?  One or four?  

If it is one, then can I assume that the space allocated for the turret 
contains the "slice" of reactor power and all the other things 
necessary for the weapons (missiles, sand buckets, etc), no matter 
which of the weapons I put on it?

What about Hull Mount?  It gets you nothing if the answer is one, 
except for less space (2 dTons less).  And fewer firing arcs (which 
isn\'t really a problem with the new combat system in GT).  

What is the use of Hull Mounting a Bay Weapon?  You get nothing 
there either except for loss of firing arcs (see above statement on 
firing arcs).

If the answer is four, then does that mean a Bay Weapon takes up 
100 spaces and not just 50?  Also, if it is four, then, to me, that 
explains why you can put three hull mount weapons on the hull and 
and take up the room for one "hardpoint."  You gain one space.

Hull Mounting does cost a little less, though, so I guess that would 
be the only benefit I can see from it.

As you can see, I am quite confused on this whole issue!!!  HELP!!!

Ah\'m truly sorry if\'n this\'s brung up b\'fore.

Page 80 of the MT referees manual describes the various starship weapons
and their damages, penetrations, etc.

A TL13 Beam Laser can fire from Far Orbit and do 600 damage (in personal
combat terms) with a danger space of 45 (squares, 1.5m across, in a
circular pattern, so a circular area about 10m across).  The weapon will
attack all targets in that area, with a penetration of 37.5 (75/5 assuming
the ship is at planetary range - halve once) at the center, halved every
1.5 meters from that point.

The to hit roll is an indirect fire task.  You need forward observer skill
to do this well.  The task is difficult (roll 11+ on 2D, modified by
forward observer skill) and the fire arrives at least one round after
called;  in fact in the example above (planetary range) it would arrive *6*
turns after calling it in.

In addition, what is targeted (in my interpretation, YMMV) is a particular
location on a map, not a moving vehicle.  Fire arrives at the location
specified (5 minutes after the call) and whether the vehicle is there or
not is a matter for the GM to decide.  You only need to hit within 10
meters to have some effect though (at a pen of 1 minimum), and even a low
penetration shot at anyone with any exposure would be deadly.

A ship would be much more useful in the direct fire role; The rules for
when you can use direct vs. indirect are not too clear, but I would say
that you need to be fairly close and, obviously, in line of sight to act in
a direct fire mode; say within 50km (Very Distant).  At that point the
gunner\'s skill and the Fire Controls of the TL of the weapon are used; at
TL13 (for example) at very distant this is still difficult (11+), but it
drops to routine (7+) at v.long (250-500m) and simple (3+) at medium (5m to
50m), plus you will usually have a gunner with gunnery skill, as opposed to
the relatively rare forward observer skill.

Also remember that laser need LOS all the time, whether in orbit or not.

There is no reference, by the way, to any attenuation of the possible
damage due to passing trough atmosphere in these rules (Megatraveller), and
I have no applicable errata.

Ah, yes, the old improvisational drill.  First thing to do is decide
whether the ship is in a geosynchronous orbit.  If the players didn\'t
specify (I consider making plans based on the ship being overhead
sufficient), then a "standard" orbit is more likely, which will put the
ship overhead for one-third of a planetary orbit, which, according to MT,
is equal to the size UPP of the planet (i.e. one orbit of a size 8 planet
takes 8 hours).

Also remember that if they "hit" that truck, there will be no evidence to
collect from the bodies to prove that they were, in fact, Zhodani spies and
what  they did was not, in fact, murder, but heroic action to save The
Imperium.

Most governments frown on firing starship class weapons at their planets.
would say the Imperium frowns on it too, but would accept good reasons as
above - once the investigation was over.

Good Luck!

Not that corridors can\'t give you congestion...but on a small ship, you
quickly get to a point where no elevator will be faster than a comparable
corridor (when you add in waits for elevator calls, cycling of doors,
fiddling with buttons, other people holding the elevator on other floors, etc).

There is no objective answer to this. I for example do not think anything
sucks about GURPS Traveller. Some think it sucks just because it isn\'t
"original" Traveller.


What DOES suck is impolite, offensive responses to perfectly reasonable
statements.

For the same reason people put up .html documents... so that the information
can be quickly accessed and used in another format (like for a research
paper in Word).

Looking at an online book simply means I\'m going to have to retype it at
60wpm myself.  It doesn\'t prevent me from copying it.  And allowing people
to copy text isn\'t the problem.  People who do not know how to or who won\'t
use methods of documentation are the problem.

There are a lot of unscrupulous bastards on the net.  As long as your
document has an ISBN # with the Library of Congress(and maybe it doesn\'t
even need that), it is the plagiarizers who are risking their ass.

Don\'t punish the sincere because of the offenses of those without morals.
OTOH, Traveller books aren\'t any easier to manipulate, so maybe you ARE
doing yourself a favor by making it harder to transcribe.

First, being a MegaTraveller diehard who\'s seriously
considering converting to G:T, one of the things
I don\'t like is the ridiculous amount of "advantages"
which duplicate each other or which duplicate the
effect of high characteristics. This useless 
complication of the rules really irritates me and 
I\'ve crossed out most of the advantages in my books,
leaving only the unique ones.

IMO, if a player wants the benefits associated
with a high stat, buy the high stat.

Second, there are *so many*, actually learning to
play the game can be a real pain. Basically, the
most difficult thing about GURPS is figuring out what
rules you _don\'t_ want to use. Using all the combat
rules really slows down the game.

Third, I find the use of the U.S. standard of
measurement a real pain after nearly two decades(!)
of using the metric system for Traveller and I
think the spread of technology within a single Tech
Level in GURPS is far too great. A Sopwith Camel is
lumped together with a Korean-war era F-86 jet
interceptor.

Fourth, because of the way SJG uses different
publications to focus on different aspects of a
campaign (medieval combat vs. space combat), IMO it\'s
necessary to buy multiple books in order to have
a well-rounded Traveller campaign. I\'m finding it
necessary to either copy and combine sections
from different books or rip sections out of various
books in order to have a  comprehensive set of combat
rules which cover medieval man-to-man up to 50th 
century starship combat.

Now you (and everyone) knows what I don\'t like about
GURPS. And I\'ll still very likely convert to G:T
despite it all. I\'m finding that, for me, GURPS\'
advantages far outweigh its disadvantages (no pun
intended). YMMV.

Hope this helps.

If you or anyone else want to know what I\'m doing
to deal with the above issues, I\'ll be happy to
respond.

What are you talking about?  Any person who has played a number of
role-playing games can offer his opinion and the support for his opinion,
based on GURPS internal evidence and comparisons with outside systems.
That\'s all I\'m looking for...  "I think the blah-blah-blah system of GURPS
sucks, because if you look on page ___ of ____ and compare it with page ____
of (another game) you will see that the other game is much smoother running
(or whatever)."  That\'s all.

> I for example do not think anything

Obviously, neither one of those were the types of responses I was asking
for.  "What sucks about GURPS Traveller" implies that something doesn\'t, not
to mention the fact that I ALREADY said that I was impressed by the
character generation methods.

It may have been a perfectly reasonable statement (that\'s debatable), but it
wasn\'t a logical answer to my question.

  Treat them as black boxes; there\'s no danger of any casing (or shielding?)
significantly blocking the signal that they\'re trying to receive. Most likely
a rough cube, but perhaps elongated boxes if mainly directional use desired.

Thucydides would set up the straw man of an oppressive Imperium to argue 
against a more responsive and more activist one.

The Imperium must not \'run the very lives\' of its people any more than 
it does now.  The necessity is that the Imperium _respond_ to the needs 
and desires of those same people.  Planetary governments under a 
restructured Imperium would continue to run planetary affairs, save that 
they could not, without drawing the ire of the Imperium, prevent the 
inhabitants from making known their desires, needs, and displeasures, 
and would be required to respond to them.  Different planets will 
express these differently, and attempting to force them all into the 
same mold is neither contemplated nor desirable.  It is the latter error 
that was made by the Ziru Sirka, and Thucydides is correct in noting 
Cleon I\'s wisdom in not following that model.  But recall that Cleon I 
_created_ his Imperium - _our_ Imperium - from the shattered remnants of 
another empire, in a time where the trade whose interests his 
construction protected _needed_ that protection merely to survive - and 
that protection took a far larger proportion of the resources of the new 
Imperium than is currently spent on the same functions.

The freedoms that Thucydides champions must and would be maintained; it 
is the \'freedoms\' that are conspicuous by their absence that the 
activist Imperium would address: the \'freedom\' to be a slave in all but 
name of an oppressive planetary government; the \'freedom\' to have no 
opportunity for planetary development because it is not in the interests 
of a megacorporation or a planetary elite that neither listens to nor 
cares for the masses, the \'freedom\' from the worry of deciding where 
one\'s own best interests lie, and articulating them, because the 
planetary government has decided that it is more qualified to make this 
decision.  Far from an activist Imperium forcing its people to be 
\'slaves under the bootheels of a myriad despots, huddled on their own 
worlds, adrift one from the other, their children staring hopelessly at 
the unreachable stars, trapped in an ever-lengthening permanent Night\', 
such an Imperium would be the opposite, liberating its people to realize 
their potential, to have a champion to fight for them when they would be 
oppressed, to bring the light of an everlasting Day to those worlds 
whose people hunger for that light.  It is not that the Imperium would 
say, "You may not be Vilani, or Promethean, or Lancian, but must instead 
be Imperial, no more and no less."  It is that the Imperium would 
establish conditions that would allow the people to take pride in being 
able to say, "Yes, I am Geonee, or JaeTallonac, or Githiaski, but I am 
an Imperial citizen."  Many planetary nations have had this kind of 
pride in unity; should the Imperium forsake it out of the paranoia of 
some few that see only the evils of the power to cause change combined 
with the will?

To be cautious in the face of radical change is prudent.  To fear it 
outright is counterproductive; it leads to the mindset that is best 
exemplified by the rigidity and attempted stasis of the Ziru Sirka.  As 
Thucydides points out, the Ziru Sirka lasted for quite a long time 
before its rotten structure was toppled by a single push - a push from a 
dynamic, active culture that was not afraid to intervene where 
necessary, while standing aside where appropriate - a governmental 
pattern that had served that culture for centuries, and served it well.  
But Thucydides tries to turn history on its head, and advocates the 
status quo as the route to success - when attempting to maintain the 
status quo was probably the Ziru Sirka\'s greatest flaw - while 
suggesting that dynamicism and activism - a remarkably successful 
formula for the \'upstarts\' from Terra - are a recipe for tyranny and 
destruction.

To accept Thucydides\' reasoning is to doom the Imperium to senescence 
and eventual disintegration.  Only a renewed, dynamic, and activist 
Imperium can stand the challenges that face it in the present and 
future.

Gallatin speaks of the need for an Imperium that actively engages the 
governments of the Member Worlds.  The thesis proposed is that \'major 
changes in the attitudes of much of the Imperial nobility\' will be 
required, and the \'restructuring - by force if necessary\' of 
\'unrepresentative or oppressive\' governments.

The proposed goal of strength through unity is a laudable one.  The 
proposed direction is both dangerous and insufficient to that goal.

It is insufficient in that the proposal would largely leave the Imperial 
Power in the hands of a hereditary nobility, whose interests will 
perforce lie largely with the commercial interests whose dominance in 
Imperial policy Gallatin currently decries.  A \'change in attitude\', 
even under threat of loss of patent, cannot be expected to be sufficient 
or long lasting; long habit almost invariably reasserts itself.

It is also insufficient in that no specific channel for the Member 
Worlds or the people of the Imperium to express their \'needs and 
desires\' has been suggested.  With no clear channel for these needs and 
desires to be expressed, how can the newly activist Imperium respond to 
them?

It is dangerous in that it encourages not merely the engagement of, but 
the \'restructuring\' of the governments of Member Worlds that are 
\'unrepresentative or oppressive\'.  Who is to decide whether a government 
falls into that classification?  What is the appropriate response?  
What, exactly, does Gallatin mean by \'restructuring\', and why should 
force be necessary?  Gallatin proposes a recipe by which an activist 
Imperium could very easily become an oppressive one - in direct 
contravention to one of the purposes to which the enhanced Imperial 
Power would putatively be put.

There is a danger in any attempt to restructure the Imperium; that 
danger is that the stresses of that process, added to the stresses that 
Gallatin seeks to reduce, will cause an adverse reaction.  This is, 
nevertheless, a risk that must be taken.  The question is whether the 
restructuring can be managed in a manner that minimizes those stresses.

A gradual restructuring, with old and new structures coexisting, may 
very well be the answer.  The Imperium is divided into Domains, Sectors, 
and Subsectors on a formal basis, and informally, several \'cultural 
regions\' are acknowledged, as are \'clusters\' and \'mains\' formed by the 
natural trading patterns caused by limitations of stellography and Jump 
capability.  Each of these may need restructuring, but cannot 
restructure without the lower levels being ready for it.  Thus, 
restructuring must proceed from the bottom up.  This has the added 
benefit of preserving the stability of the Imperium, while opening the 
way for new ideas, and feedback from the people who must benefit from 
the change.

Gallatin does not say so, but it is almost inevitable that a more 
responsive Imperium must be a more _democratic_ Imperium as well.  It is 
for this reason also that the change must come from the bottom up, 
rather than from the top down, as Gallatin suggests.  Democratic 
councils, able to listen to the people and to direct resources in 
accordance with their needs, must be formed to advise and eventually 
supplant the traditional nobility as the primary repository of power.  
Executives responsible to the Imperium must be appointed as a check on 
the councils, but must not be as powerful as the present nobility.  But, 
most importantly, the people of the Imperium must be educated to 
understand not just their own needs and desires, but those of the 
Imperium as a whole.  Gallatin is correct that time is short; the 
program of education, at least, must be started as soon as practical, 
with the first structural changes to follow soon thereafter.

To do less would be to doom the Imperium to destruction as a hollow 
shell.  To go beyond this would be to risk shattering the Imperium due 
to the internal stresses that make these extensive changes necessary.  A 
judicious combination of caution and boldness is indicated, and it is 
indicated now.  It is not our present that is in the balance, but our 
future.

It takes up one space. This is the "rotation space" inside the turret for
the equipment that moves it. The turret itself is outside the hull and can
hold up to three spaces of weapons.

>If it is one, then can I assume that the space allocated for the turret

The size of the weapon should ideally contain the power slice, and should
add up to 1 space total; you can put three spaces of weapons into a turret
(as the rules state)/

Hull-mountes weapons take up their number of spaces in the hull, and every
three spaces mounted eats up one "hardpoint" for turrets. Myself, I see no
advantage to them except on small craft.


>What is the use of Hull Mounting a Bay Weapon?  You get nothing
>there either except for loss of firing arcs (see above statement on
>firing arcs).


I myself would not do this.

Okay, okay!  You\'ve broken me down, you\'ve forced it out of me.  GT is
printed on recycled toilet paper, in sheeps blood, by migrant workers,
in sweat shops, with stolen ideas, from unpaid writers, utterly devoid
of any value, and possibly hazardous to your health.  I only buy it
because the Illuminati take the money from my checking account and
force me to stay quiet by threatening to discontinue my childrens\'
health benefits.  Besides, I\'m an addict and can help myself.

But other than that, it\'s pretty decent.  You will like it (or else).

        Well, I am a CT GM and here is what I told my players.  In "Chamax
Plague" they make the note that it takes 1000pts of personal laser weapons
fire onto a tight point to tear a 1m hole in a starship hull.  100pts will
pop an interior pressure-tight wall.
        So, CT pulse lasers do 4d x100 (~1500pts), CT beam lasers do 3d x100
(~1000pts) and deliver a DM of +2 to Fwd Obsvr rolls, CT missiles do  10d
x100 (~3500 pts).
        Now, these statements do not allow for Striker, since I have never
actually used those rules.  However, the idea *is* based on canon.  By
comparison, in Mercenary, a Z-Gun will do a 21d (~73pts) burst and kill a
tank or flatten a building handily.  I have had players in the strike zone
for a sustained orbital bombardment by a MercCruiser armed with 10
triple-pulse laser turret.  In an hour of constant firing (4 turns x 30 wpns
x ~1500pts = 180,000pts),  it simply flattened a pop: 300k city.

        I understand that Striker indicates that a beam laser is about the
hitting power of a 100mm CPR gun, and that may seem more sane.  However, I
am not sure if that is reasonable for a ship-killing weapon power, either.
Way too low, I think.

>

        Well, a light second detection in vaccum to 10000km in atmosphere is
pretty easy to accept.  In point of fact, in at least one instance, I have
had my players turn on the FCS *while on the ground* and used it to simply
incinerate an on-rushing TL3 horde.  Can you say "Rad-Haz"?  =)

Traveller.  You do have to buy too many source books in order to truly
exploit the full system, and I\'m concerned about the maps that have been
published so far for GT.  I just got Behind the Claw and a quick comparison
shows 2 star systems that are in Atlas of the Imperium and are not on the
map in BtC.  	
	The one reason I\'ve been considering running a Traveller campaign
using the Gurps system for several years now is the combat system.  If you
buy a vinyl hex map and get some 25mm figures and use the advanced Gurps
combat system, you\'ll never want to go back to anything else.  The tactical
elements of the system all fit together nicely, and gives a feel of realism
that few other systems have.  This, imho, is the one thing that plagued all
the other incarnations of Traveller.  I haven\'t used the starship combat
system from Gurps yet, so I can\'t comment on it.  Anyone else care to?

	The purpose of foundations is to provide a level, solid ... er ...
"foundation" ... on which to construct the building. It provides a
way to disperse the vertical weight forces of the building either
down into solid bedrock, or over a wide enough area of softer
material to counteract the weight. Not necessarily resist lateral
force. In fact, I recall seeing articles which showed buildings
resting on *rollers* on top of the foundation.

	The later versions of WinZip quite nicely handle this Unix
peculiarity. Unless I\'m seriously lost, this is a Tape Archive (tar)
file which has later been compressed, Tape Archive being a way to
collect multiple files together, unfortunately without compression.
Which is why it\'s been compressed (.z)!

MicroSloth world was way back in 1984, when I organized archives into
.LBR library files with LU, and then SQueezed them ...

Ugh. It\'s too subjective to answer. Besides, most people don\'t evaluate game
systems in terms of what they hate, they evaluate them in terms of what they
like. And an entire game system is a bit too big to make sweeping statements
about - it\'s like saying "What sucks about French (the language)?" - it\'s a
bit vague and more than a bit subjective. It could be argued that GURPS has
been designed to not suck, making it impossible to list any deficiencies
with the system.

GURPS, from my limited experience with it, is a good system. There are lots
of specific rules, all built from a good generic rule base. It\'s been beat
on by a large number of people, which is a good thing. The publisher is
unlikely to go out of business any time soon. The major difference between
GURPS and most other game systems is the point-based character generation
system, which has its pros and cons. What sucks about it? I dunno, that it\'s
not free. That it\'s not printed on tyvek instead of paper. That I don\'t get
paid to read it. I\'ve never had an orgasm from licking page 44. It\'s not
chocolate-flavoured. It doesn\'t sing. It never painted my house. It has yet
to break the world land-speed record . It\'s not Canadian. It taunts
children. It once de-frosted my refrigerator.

My suggestion is to go borrow the GURPS basic book from someone you know or
take a long read of it in your FLGS.

The turret takes up one internal space, empty or full.  If empty, you can
use the turret spaces for small cargo. The weapons go inside the turret
spaces (3 spaces per turret).

Apparently. This is (I was told) a necessary simplification. I suspect
many of us think that calculating power separately would have been better,
but that\'s a decision David made.

In _my_ Traveller universe, hull mount weapons can be fired by the pilot,
and only the pilot, while turret-mount weapons require a gunner. Plus you
don\'t need to pay for the turret. Your mileage may vary.

Again, in my TU I would rule that bay mounts _have_ to be in bays.

No, a bay has 50 internal spaces, and take up 50 internal spaces, so there
is no net saving. (Ie. bays are internal, _not_ "honking big turrets".) 
This is while I rule that bay weapons must be in a bay.

Okay, okay!  You\'ve broken me down, you\'ve forced it out of me.  GT is

No, you misunderstand. I know why people put up HTML pages. I was
wondering why people (say yourself) might want my 101 WebBooks in
text-selectable format. Ie. what will you be doing with the data once
you\'ve selected it?

There are people like that everywhere. But copyright violation is a matter
for civil courts, which means that I would have to dig up the money to
prosecute...

While I certainly don\'t wish to imply that Z.S. had any positive
functionality -- since we know that wasn\'t the case -- </sarcasm> perhaps
these two design features (and fuel purification plants, below) could be
less paranoiacally explained in terms of Z.S. having a more widespread
starport infrastructure than the 3I.  That is, every destination would
have facilities to refuel and renew life support -- making it inefficient
to lug the spares around through jump all the time.  The Vilani, after
all, were supposed to be masters of organization & efficiency...

Yes <G>.

First, there\'s not any "canonical" reference that I\'m aware of to Z.S.
limiting its citizens\' mobility.  It\'s a new creation of Andrew\'s, one
which makes little sense to me.

Which leads on to the second issue:  "divide and rule".  I think Z.S.\'s
policy would be exactly the opposite, actually:  unify and rule.  The
Vilani wanted there to be a culturally and socially homogeneous
interstellar domain, right?  A policy of \'divide and rule\' is geared to
produce a heterogeneous one -- and to me, much better describes the 3I,
with its mostly-enforced rule against multi-system states within the
Imperium yet allowance of local "cultural regions" or "autonomous
districts" as regional counterweights, settlement of power and authority
(both political & military) on local levels, etc.

Would ramble more in contrarian Vilanology, but I have to go translate a
long text on the evils of rabbits into classical Chinese, with Mencius as
the stylistic model.  Please forgive me.

  Closer to "way beyond huge naval gun firepower" - a 100mm at TL 8 is
probably Penetration ~45, tops, while the laser may be around Pen 90 or
so. Every 8 is a doubling, so the CPR/MD is down by about 98%?

I don\'t really think you can say "Ripped Off". Look at the credits. Under
"Designers" - Jean Giraud.  Who is, of course, the artist who signs his
comics work Moebius.

Damn hard for him to Rip Off Himself, no?

True. Niven is what I call an "old school" SF writer. One who worries about
the nuts and bolts of the technology he uses as well as the social changes
it engenders. In this he\'s much more like Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein than
most of the other writers of the 60\'s, when he began to be published, an
even moe so now.

No arguments on this.

I would say the problem with Fifth Element was that it was advertised to the
North American market as a Hard SF Thriller. Bruce Willis\'s name was
emphasized, and the commercials cut to show action and explosions.  That\'s
not what Luc Besson produced, and so it flopped, in part because the average
american Action movie goer took one look and said "huh? What kind of shit is
this?" and left.

It was a massive hit in Europe, where Besson and Giraud were the names that
were emphasized in the ads, and the movie was placed as a soft thriller with
visuals designed by "Moebius" - a name much more in the public eye there
than in North America. The Euro-fans got a much better idea of what they
were getting, and came out in droves.

My theory is that had this movie been done in French by some european
production company with european stars, rather than by Sony, in english,
with american actors, the subtitled version would be considered much more a
genre classic than the movie we have, with north american fans who had seen
it raving about it to those who had not. But that\'s the road not taken.

Maybe the problem is your approach. You convey this bombastic personality
online, which I\'m sure you\'re quite proud of, and some people don\'t react
well to that. If you really want an answer to your question, maybe you
should try to rephrase it in a more articulate manner.

However, if "being you" is more important to you, then by all means keep up
your current approach. Just don\'t expect everyone to readily answer your
posts.

No, you misunderstand.  For the same reason people like html for its
accessibility and ability to be manipulated, so that they can take info and
paste into a research paper and THEN document the source, players would like
to be able to take a "webbook" (.html webbooks exist) \'s text and copy and
paste it somewhere else.  For example, maybe I\'m running a PBEM and want to
copy just SOME of a bunch of vehicles\' stats from multiple sources to make a
"used car lot" for my campaign. Well, I can\'t do that with your book (or any
regular book).  No, I have to type it all in.  That\'s not a REAL big problem
for me, since I can type fast, but for others, it is going to be even more
of a problem.  Maybe I don\'t want the players to know all of the stats.
Well, then I have to do like the old days and photocopy pages and cut and
paste portions of stats onto a piece of paper and then photocopy that.

Starting to get the picture?  If your source can\'t be copy and pasted, it
becomes like any other book, and IMO, copy and pasted is just like quoting,
if you provide the references.

And what GM takes parenthetical time to comment, "I created this ship but I
didn\'t create that one.  Rob Prior did that one"?  Players don\'t care.
They\'re about to get blown out of orbit by a mysterious ship they\'ve never
seen before.

This one\'s pretty self-explanatory. Since I have
no intention of ever selling my GURPS books, I
hack/slash/markup/highlight any changes I want.

I\'m also seriously considering cutting off the
binding and organizing the info any way I want it.
A nice thing about the GURPS books is there plenty
of margin along the binding to punch holes for a
three-ring binder or to have a copying store (like
Kinko\'s in Texas) rebind it for me.

Definitely download the GURPSLite rules, playtest
and learn them, then add in the rules you like. 
Unfortunately, this can take quite a bit of time to
playtest but, in the long run, it\'s worth it.

IMO, the most critical GURPS books for this are:
Basic Rules
Compendium I
Compendium II

Don\'t get either of the Compendiums until you\'ve
identified all the Basic Rules you do/don\'t want
to add onto GURPSLite. The Compendiums contain
rules taken from other publications which have
proven most useful across the most campaign
backgrounds (the rules, not the publications).

Once you\'re finished with the Compendiums, *then*
look at the individual publications. BTW, I\'m
referring strictly to those publications which
you\'re considering for additional rules. If you
want just background, by all means, pick up
the publications which grab your interest. 
"StarMercs" is very good for this (and not just
because I playtested it) as is "Behind the Claw".

These two issues require some work. To keep my
work down, I\'m rounding US measurements to their
nearest metric equivalents. Example: "cubic yards"
become "cubic meters" and damn the difference.
I\'m playing a game, not modeling reality for an
employer. I make sure my players know this up
front and give them my blessing as GM to do the same.
Any arguments between a player and me which arise
from these differences are settled by high die
roll. If I lose, I lose.

Re: TLs, I\'m looking into the use of "fractional"
TLs. As an example, assuming propellor aircraft is
first available at TL7 with 1990\'s jet aircraft
available at TL8, I\'d would place WWI-era propellor
aircraft (Sopwith Camels) at TL7.2, WWII-era props
(Spitfires/P-51 Mustangs) at TL7.4, subsonic
jets/rocket aircraft (Me-262 German jets?) at TL 7.7,
supersonic jets (F-86 and better) at TL8.

This methodology was first discussed in one of
the old JTAS\'s.

"This is not a bug, it\'s a feature."  ;-)
This is handled the same way as Issue #1 above.
The fact that SJG has published generic rules
in the Basic Rulesbook, then expands/replaces
them in a more focused "milieu" book is actually
beneficial in the long run. I personally like
the Martial Arts book over the more generic
judo/karate definitions in the Basic Rules.
I still pick and choose the MA rules I want to
use and will trash these rules in favor of
playability in a heartbeat. It all depends on
what my players enjoy the most.

If I do combine pages from various books, I make
sure I label each page as to which book and
version it came from. Cuts down on arguments and
helps me upgrade to a better version.

Clif, I am a CT player from way back and a GURPS player sence the boxed set
so perhaps I can help.

If you mean how it compared the CT.

Good things about Gurps.

Characters do not die in creation.
Charaters all all about equal.
Rules have more depth.
More suport products.
Charaters develope in a reasonable way in a reasonable time period.
Realistic combat.
Players get their points by playing their character.

Bad.

Charaters all all about equal.
Charaters effectiveness often depend on the player ability to tweek them.
Rules are more complecated.
Having to buy the support products.
Characters can become so powerfull as to upset the game. (GM shood take care.)
Deadly combat.
Point pandering by overplaying obnoctious disadvantaves. (GM can fix this.)

Anything else you\'d like to know?  I sorry if this it not what exactly what
you asked for but I thought a comparision would be helpful.  I like both but
generally prefer GT because of the greater support products and that
characters can grow in a controled and meaningfull way.  

If you want a \'sucks\' problem then it would be how gurps deals with very
high skill levels (25+) and that it is difficult to balence high damage
weapons and character suvivability in a realistic campain.  Most who play
GURPS learn quickly that combat can and does kill the careless and unprepared.

GURPS rules work OK, some folks think they\'re great and others dislike them.

Without getting into the "what\'s real traveller" issue, I can say that the

So; in my own opinion, the only one I can reliably quote:

>Call him the voice of History   ;-)

Actually, if we (as XXc list members) look at the extant material
on the Rebellion, it becomes possible to suggest several options
for Thucydides\' identity.

First:  Consider the actions of Margaret in the Rebellion.  Her
faction, with the support of Tukera, essentially maintained the
former Imperial structure unchanged, with the same lack of
activism that \'Gallatin\' wishes to change.  Thucydides could
therefore be Margaret, any of the nobles who would have supported
her in the Rebellion, or any of the megacorporation movers and
shakers, as it is their interests that are served by the current
Imperium.

Second: Thucydides argued for maintenance of the status quo, as
you point out.  That\'s a very Vilani attitude.  Granted, it\'s not
the Vilani model that\'s being supported, but it can be argued (as
Thucydides does) that the Vilani model was a failure (although
the Vilani would maintain that this was because the upstart
Terrans, without due consideration, tossed out all of the Vilani
traditions without providing stabilizing substitutes).  So, the
next best thing would be the status quo - and hey, it\'s only been
used for the last thousand years; shouldn\'t we give it a fair
trial first?

The other thing to remember is that events didn\'t fall out here
as they did in the TNE universe - so those events don\'t influence
the thinking of the \'major players\'.  Given that Dulinor was the
instigator in the TNE universe and that Norris did his thing
without direct involvement in the Rebellion, it\'s reasonable to
assume (as I did) that their attitudes won\'t necessarily change
much - and Norris went far beyond what Dulinor _said_ he wanted.
Thus, \'Gallatin\' (Dulinor) and \'Dilgaadin\' (Norris) are both on
the same side, but Norris feels that Dulinor is being too timid.

I think we\'re off to a reasonably good start on this; I hope
others choose to join in.

1) You will be able to buy ACQ via SJG once we have laid it out into the
101 book, completed any illustrations, printed it and shipped it to the
USA, and then had SJG add it to their catalog. This assumes that they order
it straight away and don\'t wait for a re-order.

2) ACQ doesn\'t use hit locations, instead it has increased damage hits if
you go above the target number. Kind of MT-like if I think about it...

Can you give me some examples to see what you mean?

If I wanted a character that could run a long way but was not very strong
I\'d take high running skill and extra fatigue, not a high strength score.

You are right about having to buy a lot of book though, but then again there
is a lot of information in those book that can spur adventure ideas.

Perhaps you would have gotten more usable responces if you would have
phrased your question more diplomaticly like, "What are the weaknesses in
the Gurps system?"

When you ask for \'what sucks\' you put people in a negative frame of mind and
make them defensive and warry.  One of the secrets to successfull
interogation is to develope a positive or \'yes\' attitude in the person you
are questioning or as the old saying goes, \'you catch more flies with honey
than with veneger.\'  People generally preffer to be conversed with instead
of cross examined.

If you are wondering about GURPS Traveller,  I would suggest that you go to
the site 

		WWW.RPG.NET

	and go to the review section and look at the reviews there (click on reviews,
look at datbase sorted by company, look under Steve jackson Games).  There are
several reviews of GURPS Traveller there, some positive, some negative, but
you\'ll get a good idea of what to expect.

			Dave Nelson

P.S. my personal view is the basic GURPS Trav book is a waste unless you
actually want to play GURPS system rules (which I don\'t)--but StarMercs is
great for any version of Traveller.

	I don\'t like the character generation system.  For me, without the random
career system it just ain\'t really Traveller.  The library data is well
done--but if you\'ve been playing raveller awhile, it\'s old news.    If you\'re
not going to use the GURPS rules, then the second half of the book is useless
to you.  (But I repeat, Star mercs is awesome, even if you\'re not using GURPS
rules).

Defensive of ...?  Me?  I was the one who ASKED! And since when is

sucks and I WANT them to be in a negative frame of mind so that they can

I\'m not cross-examining them.  I was asking for sincere opinions (hopefully
followed by support).  You people act like the Mafia owns GURPS or
something.  What are you afraid of?  Don\'t let your freedom of speech slip

Well, I\'m not sure there\'s necessarily a distinction, as there
will be many movers-and-shakers that have never actually been
mentioned in canonical material.  Consider: there are probably
about a dozen megacorporations, nearly the same number of
domains, plus prominent people like Imperially-syndicated
journalists, respected military leaders, prominent sector dukes
of prominent sectors, Imperially-respected academics from
Imperially-famous institutions, and so on.  If your campaign\'s
m&s are in a position to read "The Journal of Imperial Governance
and Policy Debate", or whatever it would actually be called,
there\'s no reason that they wouldn\'t be able to participate.

  I phrased it nicely THE FIRST TIME but got a bunch of bullsheist non-answers
  which didn\'t fit within the parameters of the question as a response, so the
  "nice" approach doesn\'t seem to be working, Mr.!

What _I_ saw was you getting testy before anyone else (like people who
read digests less frequently) got a chance to reply.  Count your
"bunch" of answers, disregarding those which are replies to your
followup posts, and you\'ll see what I mean.

By the time I had, your own statements had persuaded me not to.

	- Robert Ringrose

ObTrav:
My problems with GURPS Traveller are that it (a) uses an alternate
timeline (b) uses GURPS.


Many of these gripes aren\'t unique to GURPS.
Many of these gripes can\'t really be addressed.
But here are some of them.


It\'s too easy to min/max -- power goes to the person who made their
character better.  And somehow, that\'s never me. :>

It takes ages to generate a character (or fleshed-out NPC) without
computer support.

Some GURPS things are not as balanced as I would want (were I to run
GURPS, there would be no editic memory, for example).  The importance
of different skills varies between genres and even games -- a generic
system won\'t reflect that in prices.

The usefulness of the stats isn\'t in proportion to their cost.  Would
you rather have strength or dex in a modern game?  Which costs more?
Similarly, GURPS skills are related as "hard" "easy" etc., and cost
appropriately.  I\'d rather see them cost according to their in-game
_usefulness_, whatever that may be.

Then there\'s the gripe I have with point/skill systems in general:
Everybody ends up with a little of all the important skills.  The
medic (for example) isn\'t special, because everybody has a _little_
medicine.

Combined
with a "you can get improvement in the skills you use" (and I\'ll admit
that I don\'t know GURPS will enough to know if they advocate this
approach) you end up with the following unrealistic situation I\'ve
encountered in RuneQuest:
Character gets hurt.
The entire party lines up to try and bandage him, lowest skill first.
After all, if the high-skill medic does it, he\'s likely to succeed and
nobody will get to try.


With fewer slightly more quantized skills, you get around the
"everybody has a little of everything" somewhat.  And Traveler\'s
character generation means you don\'t get complete skill choice, so you
cannot (at least initially) have a little of all the important
skills.  And a good ref can go a long way to solving these problems.
But GURPS, by itself, does not.

	afraid or dead in GURPS.
3.	Apparent lack of research on the part of the GURPS Traveller
	authors.  Either that, or my Supplement 3 and Spinward Marches
	Campaign books are different from others.
4.	Apparent acceptance of Leviathan.  I\'ve only heard the phrase
	"Outrim Void" from British Traveller fans and Leviathan.
	At least they edited out the jump torpedoes.
5.	Lack of research into canon guidelines for the starship design

susceptible to toppling:

If you put bricks in the bottom of a tall thin box, it won\'t topple.  But
is a ship really comparable to this?  Let\'s say you have a ship that\'s
10x1x1 in terms of dimensions (basically a long needle).  Let\'s say the
ship is TL 15 and has J6 M6 P6 under High Guard.  That\'s 7+17+6% of the
ship that\'s drives, or 30%.  Let\'s say this all has a density of about 3
tons/m^3 and that the rest of the ship has a density of 1 ton/m^3.  That
means that in a ship that\'s 1000 m^3, where all drives are at one end,
you\'ve got 900 tons in the lower 30% and 700 tons in the upper 70%.  Yes,
it\'s bottom-heavy, but it\'s not exactly a box with bricks in the bottom. 

Another thing to consider is that a tall thin structure is going to
provide more leverage with which to knock it down.  That is, forces acting
at the top (say enemy weapons fire or wind) are going to have an easier
time toppling the ship.

Finally, regarding the foundations of buildings, they are there to prevent
the building from sinking into the ground.  But a stronger foundation is
necessary because there\'s more pressure per unit of base if you make the
building tall and thin as opposed to short and fat. 

Basically, all other things being equal, I don\'t think one can argue that
a tall thin structure is not more vulnerable to toppling.  Now, I\'m NOT
saying that you can\'t build stable tall thin structures of course.  It is,
however, more difficult to do.  Thus, it would be more difficult to design
a stable tall thin spaceship than a stable short fat one.

Someone said it wasn\'t original.  I have no quarrel about this.  It was

a certain genre of SF.  That\'s why it\'s great (I won\'t use "visionary"

didn\'t do well in the US was that it\'s a genre not too many people there

A couple of Trav web sites have already gone for this layout. I\'m even
thinking of modifying my site so that it is based on Tavonni - I\'m still
playing with the format to try and work this out. The biggest problem is
splitting the real-life sections from the fictional role-playing sections,
so that it is obvious which is which.

If you\'re restocking ammo while under fire, something is very wrong.  One,
anyone with a brain is gonna rake machine gun fire over the ammo truck (can
you say boom?).  Two, that means you\'re almost out of ammo.. I don\'t remember
the Merkavas capacity off hand, but the M1A1 holds 40 main gun rounds (34 in
the turret: 18 ready, 16 standby).   Burning through more than 18 rounds (and
if the job is being done right, 18 targets) means there\'s a whole lot of \'bad
guys\' out there.  Especially cause we go with the leader-wingman concept (and
platoons of 2 elements are the smallest flexed unit by SOP, though necessity
might dictate otherwise), means you have *at least* 36 rounds if not double or
6 times (a full company) that.  With a full reload and 4 from each tank in the
hull.

Loading through the loaders hatch isn\'t that bad.  Just have to have the free
bodies.  That\'s what loaders and drivers are for when we\'re not moving.  :-)

A good gunner (like say, yours truly) :-)  can hit a turret just as well as a
full tank. lol. Speed is essential in that sort of thing (what I meant by Run
and Gun: firing on the move; *not* ahem... going away... from the enemey) :-)
Having Air soften them up or (and tell us where they\'re at or even kill em)
never hurts, though. 

> Ob Trav: What are the different design philosophies between the various
> Imperial grav tanks?

The Trepidas were described in Challenge and RCVG.  Basically the 74 Mj fusion
gun of the Mk I model was upgraded to a 125 Mj "Mk II", but at the cost of
ammo capacity and ROF.  This lead to a further redesign to the Mk IIb for less
fuel and more ammo (to bring ammo capacity in line with fuel endurance).  Post
Collapse, the Regency completes the Mk III version (renamed the "Norris Battle
Tank") with a 175Mj fusion gun and a VRF gauss gun coax (which the previous
models lack).

There was debate in the Imperium about a "Lancer" all purpose vehicle that
held the a 125 Mj RF fusion gun, twice the armor of a Trepida and could hold
24 troops.  The design wasn\'t given, but i\'d probably put the sucker at 20dt
to match the TL-15 heavy grav tank, which would mean the 10dt logistics for
the Trepida/Astrin to go bye-bye.  Besides, all of the TL-15 APCs are 12dt
(including all of the Marine vehicles).  

Hmm... Maybe I\'ll design a prototype company or so to be used by Solee against
the Coalition.  :-)

Not that i\'m gonna ignore the damn thing if I can help it. ;-)   Seriously,
rounds (especially KE) are getting to the point where *no* armor can stop them

True except for the LeClerc, and I can\'t remember w/ the Challengers (I or
II).  The froggies put their own gun on the LeClerc.  It\'s 120mm smoothbore,
but they don\'t use a bore evacuator (the bulge in the gun tube if you don\'t
know) as one very significant difference (they use CO2 or something IIRC).

Course you could have it go down a checklist.  For a robot brain, w/ an
electrical/digital/dynamic kind of link up, it could probably go pretty
quickly.  Not how a human could do it, but I do get your drift.  :-)

Once you hit "autonomous" logic systems (and up), things shouldn\'t be quite as
limiting as a nomal dumb-bot is looking at.  That\'s TL12.  It means the robot
may be able to "figure out what you meant.  It can analyze data and arrive at
some very simple obvious conclusions."  -Book 8: Robots, pg 35.     High auto
at TL13 allows more inferences and instructions can be very vague.  Needless
to say, TL17 brings true AI, which means "it can exhibit truecreativity and
unporgrammed inspiration apparently through reasoning."   Wanna talk bout

The T-90 is another piece of trash, though they\'re finally going in the right
direction.  As an aside, they\'ll probably never be able to produce enough of
them to be any kind of threat (not that I consider a T-90 te be really much
better than a T-80).  The Ukranian T-84 is much better than the T-90 IMO.  

IMO, the BMP-3 is going on the other extreme from the M113.  The M2 is a nice,
happy medium, though I don\'t respect the "IFV" concept much.  YMMV.

It is or rather was.  We\'re phasing in the MPAT round.  It has an air switch
to be used against helo\'s and air targets, though really if we ever have to
*really* be concerned bout them means something is VERY wrong.  lol.    Think
super-shotgun.  It\'s a bigger & heavier round, but quite impressive.  But
first u use what\'s in the pipe.
 :-)   And have the loader put the appropriate round next.  I think a sabot
round would work pretty decent against a BMP-3.

Won\'t be busy long, even w/ T-80s or T-90s, much less T-62s or T-72s.  :-)
If they had heavy armor around, our tank units would be dueling them.  I was
referring to the MBTs attached to an army armored cavalry troop (2 platoons,
though given the current levels, it might be one or even an "element" of 2
tanks).  IIRC, Warsaw Pact units didn\'t operate *that* way, though the current
training focus isn\'t on the Russians anymore, but rather petty and lower tech
types like Iraqis and North Koreans.

They certainly do that role, but one major tactic in canon would be contrary:
the meteoric assault.   Ships troops duties do come from the Imperial Marines,
but jump troops have a very important role in Traveller planetary combat.
First wave comes in by Jump.  These are probably almost always spearheaded by
Imperial Marines w/ certain high caliber Imperial Army units next.  Then the
bulk of the Imperial Army by troop transports, etc.

I have to disagree with you slightly on this one, Doug. The way the
Imperium is described, I believe that Imperial ranks _have_ to be respected
by the locals. You might get a situation where the locals arrest a noble
and won\'t allow them to contact off-planet Imperial authorities, but the
locals would be in trouble if the noble ever escaped. Part of being a
member planet of the Imperium, I believe, is respecting and acknowledging
the Imperial rank structure.

From "Government, Imperial" in the Library Data:

"Generally, decisions affecting one area of the Imperium are settled by the
 nobility in
that area. The nobility is allowed this power primarily due to the
communications lag
which exists when trying to control such a vast area as the Imperium;
requests and
orders take too long to reach higher authorities and return."

"Nobles are regulated through standard codes of behaviour known as
protocols. Protocols
aside, nobles have few obligations in terms of provision for one another,
notwithstanding
the payment of taxes, attendance of summits, and settlement of disputes
that fall within
each other\'s jurisdictions. Members of the nobility are largely autonomous
and have few
restrictions on their activities, especially if they are in a backwater."

[snip bit about the peerage & Moot]

"The Imperial bureacracy lies under the nobility in terms of official
power. It is made up
of a number of "ministries". Each ministry has offices in each subsector of
 the
Imperium. This lessens the likelihood of sector-wide power bases forming,
and provides
more opportunities for patronage."

Now, although most of this refers to the power that an individual noble is
able to throw around while within their respective (Imperial) arena, surely
this must also mean that local authorities MUST show a certain amount of
deference to _Imperial_ nobles?

You said:
>You miss the point.  Novo Leningrad doesn\'t recognize Henrich\'s patent of
>nobility as anything more than a confession of being an exploiter of the
>masses.

However, even in Soviet Russia, the authorities treated visiting
dignitaries with the same respect as members of the Politbureau (sp?). In
effect, they are granted an honourary Social Status under their system -
that is, one that commands respect, but not necessarily obedience. You can
certainly rule that some privileges (such as the right to bear arms) are
NOT allowed on a particular world. Freedom of movement, for example, was
restricted in the USSR - also China and Japan last century. Perhaps a
better rule might be to allow a noble to "negotiate" (Liaison or Diplomacy,
Your Trav Rules May Vary ;-) what they are allowed to get away with. For
example, they may be able to carry arms from two levels below the local Law
level with some dice-throwing "discussion" - modified by good role-playing,
of course!!.

Anyway, I really appreciate the discussion and rules suggestion that this
thread has generated. While I agree that you should put the time in to
detail a world\'s attitude to law, you also need to pin down some rules or
guidelines about it. The rules suggestions proffered so far both allow
off-the-cuff decisions and provide pointers when creating detailed rules
for one system. Thank you all.

Oddly enough, I\'ve never been that thrilled with HTML. Especially the
cutting and pasting part. If only there was a way of encapsulating the
source forcut-&-pasted information... (Every semester I have to spend
hours tracking down copied material, so that when the kid & parents
threaten lawyers I can show them that I have proof that the essay was
plagarized. Gets real tricky when kids fail their final year because of
cheating...)

It is, if you do, _and_ if you have permission to do so. (Which I grant in

Oddly enough, I do. Not aloud during the game, but almost every one of my
documents includes proper attribution, when I know it. Player handouts,
especially for players who aren\'t personal friends, include all applicable
copyright notices. It\'s not much extra work, but it\'s the least I can do
for the hundreds of people who have contributed to my Traveller game over
the years.

Each weapon mount uses up one space of the turret. If you don\'t use all

A hull mount is really only useful on small craft that cannot mount a

I just print a range (ie. pages 1-5, then print again for pages 6-10, and
so on). These settings are in the standard Print dialog on both the Mac

That\'s how I had to print the SJG license agreement, because I didn\'t have

Easily solved with a calculator and your average dictionary, which usually
has conversion tables in it. GURPS is en established game system; they
shouldn\'t have to revise everything to conform to Traveller, especially when
it can be easily done by the user if desired. Myself, I don\'t care about
metric or English..it\'s a game unit. I adapt.

Realistic combat is good. It promotes more thinking and less shooting on the
part of the players. And there are ways to make it less deadly.

Trying to keep track of 20 years of stuff that your company didn\'t even
publish is not easy. That being said, I don\'t see any major errors that get
in the way, and besides..it\'s an ALTERNATE universe. I rationalize it by
saying that in this alternate timeline, some things happened a bit
differently.

4. Apparent acceptance of Leviathan.  I\'ve only heard the phrase

> At least they edited out the jump torpedoes.

Leviathan was published by GDW right? That makes it "canon" (I hate that
term). The problem here is the same that afflicts the other Canon..people
want to pick and choose what\'s "real canon" and what isn\'t.

it\'s a different system with different assumptions. You can\'t expect things
to work exactly the same. That being said, I think it does a good job of
modelling Traveller tech and ships except in those areas where consistency
with GURPS made more sense than what Traveller did. But it had to be done
with an existing system (GURPS Vehicles) so some things will change. Again,
it is an alternate universe.

The Lancer was an MT design, fully detailed in DGP\'s 101 Vehicles. I could
try looking it up after work, if you like. Nasty stats for MT (AF 50 as
opposed to the Trapida\'s mere 40, for eg), but maybe just a high-value

No, you came out and asked us to list "what sucked" about GT.  That\'s
leading with a negative.  Did you even think of asking for reviews or
opinions?  Let me show you what a "nice" approach would have been:

"Anybody have reviews/comments about GURPS: Traveller?  I\'m especially
interested in any problems you may have encountered and how you solved
them.  Thanks!"

You demand, belittle, and whine.  I\'d also insult your taste in sf, but
from what I\'ve read, you haven\'t read enough for you to have formed any taste.

OK, lets say that I *hate* points based systems.  I just don\'t like them.
So, when you ask "what sucks" about G:T, I\'m going to answer "character
generation is point-based.  it sucks."

Any question, especially one phrased as you phrased yours, on the merits of
an entire game will draw completely subjective opinions that can be argued
to death.  

Over in rec.games.frp.misc there are several flame wars going over the
merit/failings of AD&D.  Persoannaly, I\'d be happy if I never got close to
a DnD game again.. ridiculous assumptions, horrid rules, etc, etc..

But for many people, AD&D is a great game, the things I despise are the
things they love.

You weren\'t around for the Great Task System War, when this list split
apart over the task system for T5.  Trust me, you can ask a question on
mechanics and get an entire list of complaints that someone else will jump
on.  Earlier in this thread, someone gave a list of problems with G:T.
Would it surprise you that I disagreed with much of that list?

I. WebSector

I read Clif\'s post with interest.  It would be cool indeed if
each Traveller page had a \'front\' with a world from the Spinward
Marches, and on that page, jump-links to some of the closer
"neighboring" webPlanets.  Some obligatory basic info about
the world would be there, plus whatever comes into the owner\'s
head over time.  Of course, other Traveller content on the site
would be accessed via the world\'s Library Data, or the local
TAS hostel, or a network uplink (etc etc).

Who else wants to do this?  Let\'s pick a subsector in the Marches
- -- say, one of the center ones like Lunion, or (of course) Regina --
and see how far the "net" can spread.  One world per site,
whaddaya think?  Who wants to start?  Next person to agree gets
first pick!

Obligatory data:
   1. UWP line, copied straight from GAL or CORE or...
   2. list of nearby worlds;
       "owned" worlds link to the appropriate site.

Nice-to-have data:
   3. Star system fleshed out, perhaps in a table or list.
       A graphic map might be really nice!
   4. The system\'s history.  As brief or long as you want.
   5. People to meet there.
   6. Government officials and people you won\'t meet but
       will hear about.
   7. Job offers?  Etc...

This might be a really really cool way to get library data on
the worlds fleshed out big-time.  Needless to say, we may
have to be careful about copyright law.

E-Mail me if you have more ideas, and of course post
to this list!


II. GURPS

Though I haven\'t immersed myself in GURPS yet, I see one
obvious advantage to character generation -- the quirks and
disadvantages.  A great way to add depth to your character,
a way to codify his or her personality to some degree.  That\'s
a great advantage.

Another advantage I\'ve heard of is that the combat system is
unified.  You know how much damage a meson spinal mount
does to an infantryman in battle dress (yes, we all know it
vaporizes him and the city he lives in, but it\'s much much more
convincing to the character\'s owner to be able to show the
hard numbers to him in a sourcebook).  And you know how
many hits a starship hull can take from a PGMP-13 before
it melts away.  Sorry, I like to have those numbers without
having to guess or calculate.  Shouldn\'t they be there?

III. Astrogation

Astrogation should be an active role, with room for role
playing.  For instance, the player should, based on his
astrogation skill, sift a number of routes from the computer\'s
myriad calculated routes, each with a probability of mishap, time
delays, and perhaps fuel efficiencies or time in jump.  More
rolls may improve or hurt route stats, and then the astrogator
decides on the "best" one for the moment.  Doesn\'t this
sound like it would increase the human involvement in
astrogation?  If one assumes that the jump calculations do
not point to quantitatively superior solutions, then human
interaction can be superior to automated astrogation systems.

This leads me to...

IV. Role Playing

Y\'all have seen the pictures: two people have one line of
interaction; three people have three lines; four people have
six lines, and FIVE people have TEN lines... four terminals
from each person.  Now, map that to a free trader:

Captain/Pilot
Astrogator
Sensor Guy
Gunner
Engineer

During a battle, you have 10 interactions here: reasonably
chaotic, and great fun.  Remove the astrogator, and a
significant part of the fun is gone.  Merge in roles, split
out roles; we find that one absent position makes a big
difference in enjoyment.  In fact, six roles can get downright
messy; of course, it can still be great fun.

I wonder if this is why the ideal Traveller group is 1 ref and
4 to 5 players?

I add the possibility of locking a turret in a fixed orientation and
letting the pilot fire it like a hull-mounted weapon.  This is helpful if
you are short gunners.

This has been errata\'d, hasn\'t it?  A 50-ton bay is supposed to take up 20
spaces (not 50).  

One other advantage of fixed-mount bays is that they don\'t add surface area
to the hull.  This could be handy in heavily armored designs.

Welcome to the Internet.  Contrary to your expectation, I\'m not here to
cater to your every whim.  I\'m here for my own enjoyment.  

There are things I\'m not fond of in G:T, and things that I have changed and
will change, but those are mostly style things.  I\'d be hard pressed to
point to anything that "sucks." 

BTW: did the fact that I answered your other questions *and* gave you a
pointer to a place that would help you draw your own conclusions (i.e.
GURPS Lite) mean anything at all?  Apparently not.

As opposed to power going to the 6-term veteran with 16+ skills, when you
failed a reenlistment roll after one term and have only two skills? :-)
(Hey, it\'s happened to me.)  Min-maxing is possible, but in my experience,
GURPS parties will be a lot more balanced than most CT parties.

Of course, I\'m in it for the roleplaying; I don\'t generally care too much
about whether my character is "more powerful" than another character.  I
care whether I like playing him.  Mostly, that comes down to personality,
not power. 
 
One trick that may help make GURPS work for Traveller is using an optional
rule that is unfortunately not in the Basic book.  Give 45-50 extra points
but don\'t give points for Disadvantages and Quirks.  Have players pick only
the disadvantages they need to make the character "come alive."  this kills
one major source of min-maxing.

> It takes ages to generate a character (or fleshed-out NPC) without
> computer support.

This becomes much easier with experience and templates.  I can do a basic
character within about half an hour and the process forces you to produce a
personality to go with the stats.  That\'s about the same as rolling
extended chargen for a CT player and them piecing a background together out
of the various rolls.  The nice thing, IMHO, is that the system tends to
produce characters with more personality and plot "hooks" than the classic
system.  It all balances out.  However, I\'ll admit it does take practice;
I\'ve been playing GURPS on and off for about a decade.

This is a fairly common criticism, and one I can sympathize with.  Low ST
characters abound in high-tech campaigns because ST isn\'t worth the points,
even though modern weight training may make high ST relatively easy to come
by.  I\'m not sure what to do about this.  Maybe halving the cost of ST and
HT might work?  
 
On the skills front, this has never struck me as a real problem.  Assigning
them costs based on usefulness would be even worse, IMHO.  Even within the
Traveller universe, the relative importance of different skills will vary
from campaign to campaign.  In a mercenary campaign, for example, combat
skills will be much more valuable than in a merchants and traders game.  I
don\'t see a viable way to adjust this without lots of work, so difficulty
is at least a consistent measure.

FWIW, it seems realistic to me that people in dangerous professions, like
Travelling, will pick up  a smattering of emergency skills.  Compare with
the military, which instructs everyone in First Aid, basic survival, gun
training, etc.  To make specialists valuable, remember to assign negative
modifiers to skill attempts in difficult cases.  The half-point skill 11
wonder is in bad shape with a -4 on an attempt while a skill 16 specialist
is in much better shape.

They don\'t advocate this approach at all.  Points are awarded for a session
or adventure and are pooled; they can generally be used for anything the GM
approves.  The GM can always veto a point expenditure and has the option of
directing some points to skills used significantly in the game.  Note the
significantly, this sort of munchkin tactic can be easily vetoed.

I think a good referee, along with some intellectual honesty form the
players, is critical to prevent any system from being abused.  GURPS may
demand a little more, but it offers more in return.  

The big thing GURPS offers is flexibility.  Frankly, it is a game for
people who like to tinker with the rules.  People look at the mass of rules
in GURPS and assume that you\'re supposed to use them all.  Not so; they\'re
all options, not mandates.   If you want details, you\'ve got them.  If you
want a quick and dirty off-the-cuff adventure, skip most of them.  I\'m
doing a very "space opera" version, with high adventure, lots of
"cinematic" touches, and less realism.  GURPS supports this much better
than CT, IMHO.

No, you didn\'t.  You started with a fairly rude phrase "what sucks?" is not
polite discourse where I come from.  Then you decided that, because you
didn\'t get answers that precisely suited your rather nebulous demand, you
would insult the people who responded politely and in good faith.

You want to know why relatively few people have really  harsh things to say
about GURPS.  I think it\'s because it\'s a pretty good system.  That\'s why
it\'s lasted going on 15 years, which is an amazingly long run for an RPG
system.

I\'ve lurked here a while and seem people complain about you.  I was
inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt.  Unfortunately, you have
today confirmed many of the worst things people have said about you and
earned a permanent place in my kill filters.  You need to grow up a bit and
learn to accept that what you want may not be what other people want to
give you.  That\'s life.

I have tried this in the past and it takes a huge amount of time to 
do right.  I have also found that there is little interest in dynamic 
sities.  It may be a novality when first encountered but soon like 
all internet sites people stop coming to the sites.  This may be my 
pessimistic side but those who know about my efforts with the ISBA 
site and mailing list know how hard that really was.  
	But hey if you are interested in furthering the idea I ll give what 
every advice and help I can.  I still think the internet is a great 
tool for roleplaying and offers chances for gammers and GMs alike 
who want to interact with others outside their locale 
community of gammers.  They can also provide vast amounts of 
background infromation that can be absorbed into any game.  But
I have seen few (including my own) sites that do this right for 
any game. Dont give up hope though Cliff and I wont. Besides I am an 
optimsit by nature

Again, I apologize.  Yahoo Mail faulted out when I tried to send the

gazzillion posts are showing up.  I was affraid to try any more posts,
so I just logged off and went to do something else.  I was an

ago.  And of course it had to happen with an annoying post. <sigh>

Sorry Doug, there\'s not enough interest among young teenaged girls in
Traveller.  :^(

Perhaps a Traveller movie with D-Leo (I learned from my local newspaper
that\'s the nickname that his buddies use for him) could generate such
interest...

I can see it now: Leonardo as a young ne\'er-do-well rogueish character. He
meets a young, busty redheaded noble girl on a subsidized liner... they fall
in love. In the process she scorns the man she was meant to marry, a dashing
noble... then the liner hits a huge comet and many perish as a result of too
few survival bubbles.

Cameron could direct it, it could combine the sensibilities of both Aliens
and Titanic. Of course, we\'d have to hire Celine Dion to do the theme
song...

It would be an instant hit.

[From an article of mine based on one from the Traveller\'s Digest]:-

Efficacy depends on the material and its thickness.
Alpha particles travel 5-7cm in air, betas 2-8m. 
Fast neutrons (energy > 500keV ) may have more penetration than

Composites or plastics containing elements with good neutron 
capture or absorption properties eg. boron, cadmium, silver, 
indium, graphite, beryllium, and hydrogen will have better values 
than plain composite laminate. 
Alloys containing depleted uranium and similar heavy atoms will be 
at a penalty due to induced radiation (eg. neutrons may cause 
fission). 

Crystaliron (TL 10), and superdense materials (TL 12+) may have an extra
advantage in protecting from cosmic radiation, 
due to the presence of the stabilising current, or its magnetic 
properties (crystaliron hulls are effectively a single magnetic 
domain). A protective belt of charged particles will form around the 
ship.

Background radiation (basal solar and \'cosmic\' sources) :-
Baseline 2.7 rem per year (unprotected) - range 27 millirems to 7.3 rems 
per year. 

X1000 for Jovian gas giants and their magnetospheres.

Up to 500-600 rems *per hour* for flares (solar proton storms), with

    'topic' => 'Re : Muscle Power (was return of SAYBOOM)- long',
    'body' => 'How much power can manly men (or the rest of us) generate?
Some good suggestions have been proposed.

Given a brief review of physiology textbooks and the good old \'Guinness
Book\', the following data may be of interest :-

* The overall mechanical efficiency of skeletal muscle ranges from 0
(isometric contractions) to 50% (isotonic contractions e.g. weight
lifting).

* Human skeletal muscle can exert 3-4kg force per square cm of
cross-sectional area. The gluteus maximus (largest single muscle in
body) can exert a tension of 1200kg force.

* It is estimated that the total force that could be developed by all
muscles pulling simultaneously in an average adult male (70-80kg) is
about 22000kg force.

* In young adults, power output from slow walking (~1.3m/sec, 5km/h)
generates 150-175W per step. This is the total power generated - given
the mechanical efficiency of muscle, at least half of this is waste
heat.

* Considering the following physical activity scale :-
(PAR : Physical Activity Ratio - energy expended as a multiple of basal
metabolic rate)

PAR      Activity
1.0-1.4  Reading, writing, eating, standing at rest
1.5-1.8  General office work, washing dishes, ironing
1.9-2.4  Dusting, cooking.
2.5-3.3  Walking at 3-4km/h (1.9-2.5 miles/h), vacuum cleaning,
         making beds, operating machine tools, painting and
         decorating.
3.4-4.4  Walking at 4-6km/h (2.5-3.7 miles/h), gardening, window
         cleaning, mopping the floor, sailing, golf, bricklaying,
         carpentry, motor vehicle repairs.
4.5-5.9  Walking at 6-7km/h (3.7-4.4 miles/h), dancing, slow
         cycling, swimming, chopping wood or felling trees,
         labouring, hoeing, road construction.
6.0-7.9  Walking uphill with load or cross country ; climbing
         stairs, average jogging, cycling, football, energetic
         swimming, tennis, downhill skiing.
8.0+     Marathon running, biathlon, cross-country skiing.

The maximal power output we could expect is in the neighbourhood of 500W
with extreme sporting activity. Remember that only half of this is
useable for mechanical work, however.

Note that this is a sustained power output (more than 20 minutes).

* Bursts of activity e.g. 100m sprint, powerlifting, etc. can develop
very large transient wattages.

Consider Donovan Bailey\'s world record for the 100m. To accelerate to
his final velocity of ~10m/sec over one second requires 4kW assuming he
masses 80kg (conservative estimate : ignores air resistance).

The world powerlifting record (squat, 125kg class) is 455kg. Assuming a
final height of 2m, this is 9100J of potential energy. Power requirement
is in the vicinity of 2kW.

* How can we capture this wide range in game terms?
(very provisional scratchings from this point)

1. Baseline power output (W) - for average strength (7) :-
upper limbs (mass in kg/2)
lower limbs (mass in kg X (2/3))
(This assumes that muscles are 50% efficient, and gives the power
available for mechanical work).

This situation is comparable to (encumbrance <= STR X 1).
Power output can be doubled or tripled, with the same effects as
increasing encumbrance.

Above this, there should be a task, or a significant penalty for making
the attempt. Hmm...

2. For strength and endurance values above 7 :-
X1.2 per point above 7.
STR/END  8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15
Bonus    1.2  1.4  1.7  2.1  2.5  3.0  3.6  4.3
The bonus for each characteristic is added together, so an STR 8, END 9
character gets a 2.6 multiplier to base output.

3. Athletics skill should factor in here too. +10% per skill level (+5%
per T5 skill level)?

An example :-
Our world record breaking 125kg weightlifter has STR=END of 12, and has
Athletics (Weightlifting) - 4 (8 for T5)

His upper limb power output is (125 X (2.5 + 2.5)/2) X 1.4 = 437.5W
His lower limb power output is (125 X (2.5 + 2.5) X 2/3) X 1.4 = 583.3W

for a combined total of 1020.8W.

To successfully lift the 455kg weight in the approved manner, he needs
to lift it (and himself to a standing position) over a period of five
seconds (say).

Total work = (455 X 10 X 2) + (125 X 10 X 1) = 10350J, taking g as
10ms^(-2) and considerable liberty with our weightlifter\'s centre of
mass.

Power output = 10350J over 5 seconds or 2070W.

He needs a brief burst of power (X3 basal) to successfully lift the
weight.

Propose :-
To maintain power output at a given level :-
(End + skill) > Difficulty
 
Power output	Difficulty	Recheck Frequency    Example
Basal           Average            30 minutes        average walking
pace                  
Basal X 2       Difficult          5 minutes         marathon, biathlon
Basal X 3       Formidable         10 seconds        100m sprint, power
lifting.

The time increments are based on muscle energy reserves and likely
metabolism. At the end of 10 seconds, anaerobic metabolism must switch
to aerobic to replenish muscle ATP and phosphorylcreatine, and remove
lactic acid.
At the end of about 5 minutes, glycogen stores start running down, and
fat tissue needs to be \'mobilised\'.

Comments and constructive criticism welcome.

The MT stuff that was adopted from the Traveller\'s Digest (in Player\'s
Manual?) is a very good start (e.g. STR X 15 for maximum lifting
capacity, etc).

I\'ll hijack these, and add two more of my own:

Not necessarily.   Arent\' such "programs" in canon somewhere?  It isn\'t much
of a big stretch to stretch the robot rules to this (which from this thread is
what I believe GURPS has been indicated to do).  The reason there\'s a person
"behind the wheel" for important things is tricky situations, events that the
programmers can\'t conceive of and/or program ability to respond to.  Once TL17
(and true Artificial Intelligence) is reached, even this can and should start
to fade since the equipment can essentially become just another NPC, if not
PC.  

Having cabs and stuff be like from Total Recall is something that *should* be
the province of TL12+ worlds if the setting is to actually be done justice or
the game being played is "the 20th century with starships."  Having the Vilani
be obscenely conservative in their culture works too, but it shouldn\'t be
handled in a fiat and irrational manner unless you just don\'t care.  :-)  The
same thing for cybernetics, biotechnology, etc.  The Traveller universe is a
big place.  Something is probably going on nearly anywhere.  Course nanotech
probably has to be beyond the common tech levels of the Imperium, and that
doesn\'t seem unbelievable (to me anyways).

My answer for Anders is that jump calculation is not just number crunching.
It requires at least a little bit of inspiration.  Kind of like Integration by
Parts and picking which choices will be U and DV (and thus which integral will
be easier to evaluate).  You get good at it and you get a "feel" for it.  A
computer can just plug and chug very fast, but if you get to an area that
*requires* intuition of some kind...  

You gonna trust the "feel" of a computer or program?  Maybe after AI\'s been
proven, which is TL17-18 in Traveller.

Depends what rules you use.  Someone\'s already posted CT and MT.

It\'s very simple in TNE.  Shouldn\'t need to reference any special tables.
Damage is one system for vehicles through starships.  There\'s a simple
translation from character scale to that (divide or multiply by penetration
rating based on which end you\'re converting from.  In this case divide).

>	. a vehicle?
>	. a house?
>	. a large building?
>	. a block?
>	. a manufacturing complex?

Depends on what the particular item is made of.  There are armor values for
common forms of construction material and cover in the TNE book and FF&S.   I
dunno bout FFS2 or T4.  Also could have some static defenses to deal with.

>	. a town?
>	. a city?

Outside of high level strategy type games, I\'d treat these as the componet
buildings/constructions (see above).  There is a table for nuclear warheads
and their effects in atmosphere which would pretty much wipe out a whole town
(though none have the high yields to completely vaporize a city).  

>Similarly, how good is the targetting through an atmosphere?
>Obviously, in vacuum the targetting has to be damned good to hit other
>ships at Traveller ranges.  But through an atmosphere?

Range is a factor (as it always is).  The DSR has modifiers for sensors.  I
dont\' recall anything in BL or BR, though I haven\'t referenced any books.  I\'d
probably say +1 or +2 Diff Mods.   For line of sight lightspeed weapons (like
lasers) it shouldn\'t be any harder IMO.   PAWs have the problem of whether
they\'re atmospheric or space.  There is a problem switching from "neutral"
(the space weapons) to "charged."   Missles have a UWP size digit in Striker
II turns (1 hour per?)

You know, I\'ve been reading the commentary and don\'t think they have to be
assumed to be from the alternate universe/timeline.  Why can\'t Dulinor have
instigated or participated in that kind of debate in the "real" timeline?
Certainly, it seems the MT materials are clear that his methods and desires
were sticking in the craw of the nobility who despised him as an upstart...
It would have to be more than a universal draft, and devolution to bit players
in his govt, woudln\'t it?  This is the sort of thing that would piss off alot
of nobles.  What\'s INI going to bout it?  He\'s an archduke and with the
devolution of local authority, he probably has tabs on everything going on in
his domain anyways.  The key has to be that the assassination is unexpected.
His dicontent with the existing structure of the Imperium was well known,
though not the severity.

Another thing, isn\'t the basic premise of G:T that the only event that isn\'t
in synch with the official universe/timeline that Dulinor\'s gig gets blown up
(which I don\'t think will every be "officially" ever explained (leaves room
for Ref\'s who wanna head that way), that keeps him from plugging Strephon and
Family (and Aslan ambassador)?

I\'ve been noticing that.  Course my knowledge of where Norris actually went
might be coloring the lenses.  I should think Norris would\'ve been more open
minded to Dulinor in the official timeline, but alas Arrival Vengeance didn\'t
even try to stop in Ilelish, despite it being his closest neighbor (aside from
the Vilani, who the Denebians end up trading blows with in Corridor).

Yeah.  Me 2.  Kind of what I was looking for awhile back when I asked what
faction people would support.  Of course, with hindsight being 20/20 things
would look different.  But who would people have supported if they were in
1116?  It goes something like is said in the Rebellion Sourcebook.  For the
timid, they wouldn\'t challenge the power in their area.  For the visionaries
and the brave, though, it becomes something else.   They could fight and be
deposed (if not killed) or could migrate to the faction that espoused their
belief.

Except we\'re not talking bout grav tanks, but ground tanks.  Egg shaped tanks
would be kind of silly for TL-8 and tracks wouldn\'t it? :-) 

FF&S takes a much more believable approach by allowing you to slope and vary
the armor.  :-P

Well they have the typos that seem to plague the first printing of anything
Traveller. 
There seems to be an issue with the actual physical quality of the books
(anyone have an update?).  Mine are holding up well, though I\'ve taken my
copies off the shelf only a couple times, but I have heard bad things even
bout the hardback of G:T.

Behind the Claw is pretty good, if you want to run a campaign in the G:T
Spinward Marches.  If you\'ve got a rules set and you\'re happy w/ it (and have
or don\'t need the data entries and alien info) then that\'s all u probably
need.  Add Aliens I and the G:T book if you lack the previous materials.  Add
Star Mercs and numerous GURPS suggested-haves if you want to use GURPS rules.

But since *I* am asking the question, I have the right to decide WHAT I\'m

had stated this in the opening post) and NOW (to balance my view) I only
wanted to hear the negatives?  It\'s my right to ask what I like.  If you
want to go on about the positives, start a "positive" thread.  All I ask is
that if I ask for the negatives, you answer with what YOU see to be
negatives; otherwise, start your own thread or don\'t reply.

If a teacher asks the student for the date of Columbus\' "discovery"(well,
for him it was), it would be inappropriate (and certainly not contribute to
his grade, or, at least, the teacher\'s perception of the student) if the
student answered with the day that man first stepped on the moon.  It would
be just as inappropriate if the student had asked the same of the teacher
and got the same reply.

Actually, I was ONLY interested in the problems and I wasn\'t asking how they

It is perfectly acceptable and actually makes more sense to say "thanks"
AFTER you get the replies, especially when dealing with some of you chaps.
It\'s like saying "Grace" BEFORE the meal.  Maybe the meal will require you
to have your stomach pumped.  I wouldn\'t be too thankful, then.  (On a
sidenote, the Old Testament actually teaches to thank the Creator AFTER the
meal.)


>You demand, belittle, and whine.

Demand?  Yeah, right, with what authority?  You\'re daft!

Belittle?  Yeah.  (just did, I guess)  People tend to do that when they ask
one question and get answers that don\'t even fit within the parameters.

"What do you wanna do tonight."

"I saw your mother sleeping with your Dad\'s boss."

"What the fuck are you talking about you psycho fuck?"

>  I\'d also insult your taste in sf, but
>from what I\'ve read, you haven\'t read enough for you to have formed any

Yeah, and some very well-read people would be so ashamed to be seen with me
because of that.  Get the %&$* outta here!  Your idea of condescension makes
me laugh.  You\'re like some chick trying to impress me with her Avon
jewelry.

Personally, I\'m not impressed by much at all.  When it comes to other men
walking this earth, I like them based on how they treat the "old rags" of
humanity (and on their capacity for and expression of truth, which I have
seen you are capable of). You might say that I would then hate myself, being
as abusive as I am, but if you observed me you would see that I am not
abusive towards people UNTIL I see them abuse the little men and women.

That you did this or that, or that you own this or that, or that you\'ve
slept with her or the other really means nothing to me.  And what that means
for YOU, Doug, is that as long as you\'re humane to the little man, you never
have to worry about impressing me, because I have nothing against you.

The rest doesn\'t mean shit to me.  Men who have done the same are now
pushing up daisies.  Show me a man whose has conquered death based on his
own merits, and THEN I\'ll be impressed.  Death is the great equalizer and
the ONLY true meritable boast in my eyes is to do your best to make the
world better than it was when you were born into it or to AT LEAST not
contribute to its decline.

You can do this.  I can do this.  If we all can do this I\'ll be impressed.

I\'m not hearing any post-Reformation taboos.  Where I come from, "what

And you need to grow up and accept that fact that while I still have my
freedom of speech (in actuality, you always do, unless they gag you) I am
going to point out the fact that an answer doesn\'t fit within the parameters
of the question and re-ask it.

How is this "random" and how is it an "outburst"?  If anything, I was trying
to express my exceptance of Dough, giving him the benefit of the doubt in
assuming that he is not the sort of person who looks down on people because
they aren\'t as well to do as he is.

Actually Traveller books are just as easy if you have a scanner
:-)

If I can\'t be bothered hacking the security on the PDF file, then PDF
file is more "secure" than the book, as I have to print the PDF and
then scan it, whereas I just have to scan the book.

BTW, Rob was asking why people want to cut and paste.

My major use of my scanner and online documents is for putting
together convention scenarios.
The last scenario I did, I scanned lots of character sketches from
various RPG\'s and scanned character descriptions from several
locations, then made minor modifications, plus plot related details,
resulting in a unique  collection of characters with less work than
writing them from scratch.

Another reason, often, in a game, one wants to provide only _some_of
the information in a book, so a scan or cut-&-paste is much better
than a photocopy or full print-out, especially when there\'s some
additional detail, such as the advertising brochure I put together
once a ame set on the  "King Richard", which included quite a bit of
text from the original, but more pictures and colours.

Unless the planet is low tech, I\'d say the first the PC\'s hear of the
response will be the missiles or lasers of the planetary defense
system vapourizing their ship, or at least disabling their power plant
and drive.units.

Starship-class weapons being fired at a planet without prior
governmental clearance by anything other than an obvious Imperial Navy
ship in hot pursuit (and even then they\'d normaly at least _request_
clearance before firing)  is an act of war or piracy, and will be met
with lethal force.

"Weapons, get me a firing solution on that truck"
"Yessir"
"Comms, get me COACC"
"On line"
"COACC, this is Captain Hieronymous Kurzweil of the Imperial Navy Ship
Ingenue requesting permission to fire on a planet-bound vehicle
engaged in an Imperial crime according to Naval Regulation 5043,
section 5, paragraph 12"
"....Er, right, um, excuse me, sir, while I contact my supervisor"

Weapons, fire when ready !
It\'s good the Book just requires us to _request_ permission before
firing, isn\'t it gentlemen ?  "

want we should mess up the territory around it a bit more ?"
"No thank you, Weapons, I have no desire to indulge in landscape
gardening. Comms, I\'ll be in my cabin when the ruffled feathers call"

I\'d say the only way the player\'s could avoid damage to the ship would
be to immediately broadcast a surrender and power down the drives to
minimum required to hold station. Even that might not be enough.

Although I\'m not one to point out spelling errors, I did have to take a
double take on the above: "my exceptance of Dough," it\'s unrelated and not
terribly insulting to you, but I chuckled. It has a humorous double meaning.

<Summary Follows>
The Imperium is a joint creation of many species.  These include Humans of
many kinds, Vargr, Vegans and many others.  Despite this, it is dominated
by humans, and human nobles are prone to view it as a human empire.

It is a characteristic of human intellectuals to worship the status quo,
and regard their own societies as constituting the ultimate development of
social organisation, or the "End of History".  Vargr do not share this
prejudice.

It is commonly believed that Vargr are incapable of creating stable and
organised societies.  This ignores the existance of at least two states,
composed, like the Imperium, of a mixture of Vargr, humans and other
species, that have existed for a duration comparable to that of the
Imperium.  These are the Julian Protectorate and the Domain of Antares, and
especially the League of Antares, itself.  Antares is a true sovereign
power, obedient only to the Archduke Brzk, and the mighty Emperor Strephon,
to whom alone Brzk defers.

It is a foolish human conceit to believe that any remote authority can
impose an arbitrary model on every world in the Imperium.  Such faceless,
uncharismatic powers can only fail in the face of more charismatic local
leaders.

To reform the Imperium, it is necessary to reconstitute it along more
Vargr-like lines.  By permitting more freedom from arbitrary and remote
centralised authority, it will be more possible for local uncharismatic
tyrants to be removed, rather than having them supported by a central
authority and its blind diktats.  Freedom can not be established from
above, it can only be seized from below.

The strength of the Imperium lies in the partnership between the species
that constitute it.  It is time for the human dominated nobility to
recognise this.  Brzk is the embodiment of this partnership.

Brzk is the mightiest of all Vargr leaders.  Brzk defers only to Strephon. 
Brzk is loyal to Strephon.  Brzk is mighty and charismatic.  Brzk deserves
his power.  Follow Brzk, the only leader who can save the Imperium!  Brzk
deserves your respect.  Brzk is charismatic.  

Brzk is charismatic.

Aside from the characteristic Vargr posturing, these sentiments, while

Analysts:
<Omitted> 

Out of character:
My brain isn\'t quite working, so this doesn\'t quite constitute a cohesive
position.  Too bad - not all positions will necessarily be cohesive.

I have used this format rather than attempting to simulate the bombastic
style of an extremely charismatic Vargr.  Such a style would, I suspect, be
deeply annoying to read.

Anyway, the key elements are that Brzk was one of the more liberal leaders,
with a clearly pan-sophontist style.  However, I can\'t see a Vargr buying
the idea of a remote central authority having the power to interfere in
local affairs.

Comments etc are welcome.  If anyone objects to me grabbing Soegz, create
your own Vargr leader.  It\'s guaranteed that there will be more than one
Vargr viewpoint!  And it\'s only a guess by Naval Intelligence that \'Soegz\'
is Brzk...  He may not be.

  This only happens, if you have a gaming group of munchkins. Every system
I\'ve ever seen can be abused by a determined enough power player, and
GURPS is no expection. The easy solution: play with people more interested
in playing their roles, than creating maximized killers. GURPS offers a
very powerful set of tools for creating in depth character personalities 
you\'d never get by randomly rolling a character. (Just IMO, of course.)

  It\'s all about how you play your character. My GURPS-based character in
the Traveller campaign where I\'m a player (I also GM my own camapaign) is
absolutely the weakest of the group if you look at skill levels or total
point value (some 25 pts below the next lowes one), but somehow he still
seems to be the one who actually gets things done. Accomplishing things is
more a matter of attitude, than point values. (Of course my character is
more than a bit nuts, and I fully expect him to get killed sooner or later
with all the stupid risks he takes, but that\'s all part of the character
concept I happened to come up with.)

I\'ve been using GURPS for about 2 or 3 years now, and I can put together
an NPC in about 15 minutes. A PC would take maybe 20 min to half an hour.
That\'s just for the numbers of course, coming up with a concept takes a
varying amount of time before that. That\'s actually one of the things I
like about GURPS: it forces you to come up with a pretty solid concept,
before you start putting anything on paper.

  The example you picked happens to be one I agree with. Eidetic memory,
as it is written, is patently ridiculous. That\'s one of the very few
advantages/disadvantages I\'ve had to disallow, though.

  We\'ve done just that in our games, works for us at least. Also we have
recently converted to a varinat skill system, where skills are bought at a
base of 10 (instead of being based on a stat), and you might get some
bonus to the roll from whatever stat the GM deems applicable to the
situation at hand. This nicely eliminates the worst min-maxing technique
in GURPS system. (Who needs points in skills, I\'ll just buy DX and IQ 14,
and I can get away with 1/2 pt in each skill.) With the ten based system
you can play a character with all the stats at 10 and most points dumped
into skills, and do just fine. (There are people like this in real life.)

  GURPS puts a lot of responsibility on the player to pick skills, that
actually make sense. Of course the GM can disallow any skill he feels the
character couldn\'t have learned with his background, but if everyone
understands the object og the game, this reaaly should not be necessary.

  I totally agree, that interstellar travellers, mercenaries and the like
should have a wide selection of skills at low level besides their actual
specialty. You pick up the strangest things moving around a lot. (A frined
of mine comes to mind. He\'s served in the british armed forces, travelled,
quite literally, around the world, and done maybe a dozen odd jobs in half
a dozen different countries. A GURPS character based on him would have low
values in literally dozens of skills, some of them _very_ strange.)

  Specialization still counts for something, even with people having a lot
of low level skills. Being a competent doctor, for example, takes 40-50
pts worth of skills, and there are many situations where nothing short of
a qualified medical specialist will do.

  We use a slightly more controlled system. Most skill ponts we get are
from training. (Lots of time for this during jumps.) When someone
accpomlishes something especially noteworthy with a skill, the GM might
award 1/2 skill point for that sprcific skill. This is not very common, on
the average, our 4 person PC group hauls in a net total os 1/2 to 1 1/2
pts for a full length session. This simulates real life rasonably well
IMO. (Remember you get 50% of work hours as training, we get a steady
income of points just by doing our regular jobs on the ship.)

  Once again, if people actually concentrate on maintaining the roles of
the characters, no one will even consider trying a skill just for the
chance of scoring a critical and being awarded a skill point.

  Customizability is the main atrraction GURPS has for me. You go for the
cinematic feel, and GURPS gives you excellent tools to do just that. Our
games are the polar opposite of this. We try to make everything as
brutally realistic as possible, and once again GURPS easily bends to our
wishes. (Of course, our version of GURPS is so haevily customized, that SJ
himself might have trouble recognizing it, but the again I guess most
peoples\' GURPS campaigns are that way. As you said, it\'s a system for
people who like to tinker.)

I think its chicken and egg. The policy wouldn\'t work without an extensive
infrastructure, but I\'m also sure that the Vilani would not have been unaware
of all the benefits of such a policy.

Well my reading of materials says "heraditary caste system with works
tied to their locations" (or some such wording). However I don\'t think the
general population were formally restricted as such. Its just that since
most people had no reason to travel, they generally didn\'t.

Here Kenji and I disagree. I agree my ideas of divide and rule are wrong.
However I don\'t think the Vilani did have a deliberate policy of assimilation.
We apparently have large numbers of cultures which survived more or less
intact throughout some 1500+ years of Vilani rule. If the Vilani did have a
policy of absorbsion they would not have survived. Now it might be that all
these cultures were reconstructed during the RoM and/or Long Night, but to
me that doesn\'t make sense either. To start with, linguistically they would
be about as far removed from Vilani as the French are from Latin which
does not appear to be the case. Also their cultures should (IMHO) show a
far greater Vilani influence than appears to be the case. My theory is that
this concept of the "evil" Vilani deliberately attempting to crush local cultures
is a much later representation (a propoganda ploy by the RoM) driven by
political motivations. IMHO what actually happened was that the Ziru Sirka
placed heavy restrictions (including travel) on non-absorbed races (precedent:
the Vegans) and imposed additional taxes (to pay for their "repression") on
them and imposed Vilani governors to organise them to "efficently" pay these
taxes. But that is as far as it went, there was no deliberate policy of
"Vilanification"; it was just to be a part of the Interstellar community, you had
to play by the Vilani rules. Now there may well have been some cases where
an individual race was judged to be too dangerous to "Interstellar stability" to
be allowed to exist and these races may well have been deliberately
"assimilated" (precedent: the Leoskalth); but as a general rule, the many
alien cultures the Vilani conquered during the Consolidation Wars were
allowed to continue to exist so long as they did not threaten overall Vilani
dominance.

I think this was a BMP (or was it BTR?) *6*. Something they are
producing for export, because they can\'t afford it themselves! The
specs are from a TV program covering modern armor, and since the
Russian gear they covered was being shown to prospective buyers, I
think the info was correct.

Whatever it was, it had 8 wheels and was a *fast* SOB. They were
running it at speed up over an earth mound (15-20 feet tall) and it
went *flying over the top and hit ground again about halfway down the
slope. <shudder>

Police forensics tech testifying at trial:

"Samples of air were collected in a grid centered on the probable last
location of the vehicle. Analysis showed a distribution of elements
consistent with the destruction of a large truck and several bodies by
a medium ship\'s laser. Some DNA fragments were recovered. While they
were insufficient for ID, they are not inconsistent with the DNA of the
purported victims."

Well, as I understand it, SJGs contract restricts them to a universe where
Strephon didn\'t die. Just how that came about is shrouded in mystery, but
assuming for purposes of argument that Loren has settled on one single
divergent event from which all differences flow (so much more elegant than
multiple differences), the event must take place quite a while before 1116,
since in the OTU Strephon had not decided to make Norris an archduke when
he died whereas in tht GTU he had done so long enough before to have
summoned Norris to appear at Capital in late 1116.

Of course, if Loren don\'t want to mess with the \'single divergent event\',
all bets are off and any amount of differences are possible. But if he does,
conditions in the GTU should in most cases be identical to conditions in
the pre-Rebellion OTU.

Not that I know of. Last time I checked, a 50-ton bay takes up 50 internal
spaces, and can mount 50 spaces of weapons.

Mind you, I heard rumours that David Pulver thinks bays should be "honking
big turrets", so I built a switch in "GT Shipyard" that will let the
designer decide whether to follow Traveller rules (which have always
treated bays as being internal) or GURPS Traveller rules (if they ever
deviate from Traveller in this, which AFAIK they haven\'t yet).

That\'s two good reasons for putting them on the outside I hadn\'t thought
of.

So a sphere of superdense, possibly with mounting brackets at the base.

superior system to say ADnD..I don\'t want to get off topic. :)
GURPS world books can be used by a GM too...If some was in a 
Trek/traveller "mood" then a GM could transport the players to a world 
based on Ming China or Rome...
That\'s just a few pluses I see...Now back to the flame war :)

Scores of 4 (the minimum on a 4-20 scale).   I have the feeling that if stats
were point based in Traveller everyone would end up with a SOC score of either
2 or 12--I mean unless you\'re noble, what\'s the point wasting points on SOC.

Hmmm....  Young D-Leo boards the ISCV King Richard, and spots his ONE True
Love (Kate Winslet) boarding as a High Passenger.  Leo dreams of meeting
her, and showing her that a SOC 3 dweeb can talk her out of her clothes
just as well as her SOC 10 jerk fiance.  This fantasy continues right to

Clif, leave the trash talk to the B-ball players.  If you expect any of
us to take you seriously, you have to act and talk like an adult.  Get
off the proselytizing (sp?), and maybe you\'ll get some answers to your
questions rather than getting brow beaten.

What I ment by a negative frame of mind is that, they are NOT going to
answer you in the way you hope they will, not that their answers will be
negative.  Their responce is what is negative not thier comments.  Oh, and
when you ask \'what sucks\' it does sound troll like in that it it is
confrontational and inflamitory.

I have never been afraid of expressing my oppinion but you did not ask for
an oppinion.  You asked for \'what sucks\'.  Words convey ideas.  When you ask
\'what sucks\' the idea infered by your reader is, \'he hates the systems and
needs proof of why he hates it,\' or \'he is closed minded and has already
decided to hate it.\'  When you ask about a systems weaknesses you seem to be
\'testing the waters\' and people will be more helpfull and the information
you get will be more usefull.

	This is only my opinion & no flames are directed towards anyone.  Written
communication on the net does not carry the same messages we pickup from
verbal communication.  It pays to be careful about offending people.  I
have found it actually DOES pay to say "Thanks" when you ask the question,
after all you are asking people to give up their time to answer a question
that YOU want answered.  If they give you a good answer, then thank them
again.  I am normally  a lurker on this (& other lists), but I have been
here for a fairly long period of time.  This is one of the best lists I am
on.  I constantly amazed at the wealth of knowledge people reveal for the
sake of a polite question.  The best reason to be polite is because you are
, the second best reason is so that people treat you the same way.  If you
follow the second reason long enough you will probably find it becomes the
first reason.  Just a point to ponder.

The idea that a Traveller "party" should be balanced gives me the
heebee-geebees.  Sounds like old AD&D where you had to have one of
each class in the party.  Yuk.  If I\'m running an archeology campaign,
then I want a bunch of characters with the same skills, but differing
capabilities, thereby letting the the PLAYERS\' personality differences
come through.

On the opposite side, if we are unsure of what we are going to be
playing (adlib games are my favorite) then it is part of the adventure
to see what the characters turn out to be.  How the skills and stats
come out will determine where the game goes.  I love to see good
players RPing something totally different than they\'ve ever tried
before.  It\'s a stretch for the Ref, too.  Great fun.  I don\'t know
that that would necessarily be lost if a point-based system were used
exclusively, but the randomness of the Traveller CharGen system has
surprised and delighted me over the years.

Well, IMO, there was *one* worse instance: Leroy Guatney\'s brief membership
a year or two ago. Fortunately, most of the members including myself
shouted him off the list after he annoyed everyone with his pomposity for a
couple months.

Clif here is another animal altogether. He seems to be about 17-19 years
old and suffers from a malady that\'s all too common in the e-mail world. He
figures since no one will ever actually see him face to face, he can act
however he pleases. So, in effect you have this guy running amok behaving
like a virtual 3-year-old.

Me, I\'m just gonna ignore him. He doesn\'t seem to have anything valuable to
offer anyway. If he continues to assault the list with a dozen belligerant
posts per day, however, we may want to ask the list admin to throw the bum
out.

Mention not that name!  He might come back <shudder>

Actually, Leroy was immortalized in some early drafts of ACQ.  In the
animal section he gets butted by a Denebian Tree-Ox, and when I need a name
for a poisonous vermin, it became the Guatney.

In personal e-mail Clif told me enough that I actualy believe he was in the
service (for how long I\'m not sure), but then he told me that his life was
the basis for that Harrison Ford movie about the IRA man hiding out in
America, and I gave up in disgust.

Actually, all the information on this is f*cked up.  A 50-ton bay is actually
supposed to take up 10 spaces.

Gee, Doug, with that "insider\'s" scoop, I\'d say that you ARE a "Templar

It is my own opinion that Clif\'s posts are often ill-considered and rude,

couple, but from now I intend to follow a policy of simply ignoring anything
said in an offensive manner, or anything phrased in the "what sucks" style.
I don\'t intend to answer, to criticise or to even refer to any such posts.
If the gentle in question speaks civilly, I\'ll answer.

If others do the same then we\'ll at least not have to read endless
discussion of Clif\'s latest antics. And Clif will have to learn to speak
civilly to his Traveller brethren, or be ignored. OR become so offensive in
order to get a response  that he\'ll be removed from the list.

So manoeuvre for flank shots, if you really must engage the M1s (which
is really the job of your T-90s). On the other hand, the M2 crowd are
going to be really put out if they have to go up against the BMP-3.

Define effective. That 120mm Rheinmetall gun can\'t penetrate the armour
on a T-90, even with an APFSDS-DU round.

Of course, if you think that you\'ll be holding the position after the

For another example, look at the UK\'s AS90 self-propelled artillery
piece. Ok, different mode of employment - but the rounds are loaded
through the rear doors since it\'s far quicker that way. The army also
trains to fight off ammo dropped behind the vehicle, with the on-board
stuff as a spare.

There\'s bound to be four - mobility; lethality; survivability; and
balanced.

There is much truthi in this, I think. I have yet to be verbally assaulted
by anyone on the TML for any reason, despite a modest amount of posting.

Hmm. I wonder why that could be. Certainly it\'s not my good looks. ;-)

ObTrav: What are the external dimensions of a standarard Imperial cargo
container (as mentioned in 102 Vehicles)? Is there anything significant
about their looks (i.e., external hooks, grapples, insignia, etc.)?

You don\'t seem to get it.  Despite what people think, I WAS NOT taking sides
for or against GURPS.  I had said I was impressed with it and now I wanted
to hear "what sucked" about it.  I was trying to achieve a balanced opinion
of it, plain and simple.  You guys are the ones who take two words, "what
sucks" and instead of answering the question turn it into some kind of
springboard to talk about me and fret about the dangers inherent(?) in the
words "what sucks".  I don\'t give a hoot whether you talk about me or not.
I\'m on this list for information.  If you were on the Space:1999 list (also
filled with Sci-Fi discussion) you would see that my presence there is
altogether different.  This is mostly because the people on that list are
much nicer and not so eager to prove to everyone how smart they are.
Despite what you say to the contrary, a number of you quickly became biased
against me and it continues to this day.  I am subscribed to this list for
information, not for attention, just as I am with the Space:1999 list.  If I
ask a question and I receive answers that fit within the parameters of it,
then the thread will soon be over.  I don\'t demand answers anymore than I
can force you to click your mouse (what a bizarre excuse!).  If you don\'t
want to answer, then don\'t!  If you\'re a bunch of ninnies to me, than you
can predict what is going to happen.

Joseph, you mean I somehow missed you?  You must have an awfully low stealth
signature...  ;^)

Well, I searched my in-box and found two other messages from you where you
answered my questions in a rational fashion, and rather politely, too.  I
could learn something from you.  : )

It all does seem pretty common-sense, doesn\'t it?  As much of an "equal

have missed you?  You weren\'t an ass.

1) The broad TLs (but someone already said that).

2) The need to buy soooooo many books to cover the rules that CT/MT used to
have.

3) And this is the killer for me - the lack of a task system. I dislike
modifier driven games and prefer the change the task difficulty option.
GURPS feels clunky to me. Imagine MT as a third generation RPG? Well, GURPS
feels like a second generation game, reworked, formated and updated and
released as a third generation game. It lacks, IMO, a certain elegance and
simplicity. Too many rules.... YMMV of course.

but....

1) GT is a good book and could be run with G:Lite

2) BtC, AR1 and SM are all superb supplements and useable for previous
Traveller editions.

I like the work SJG have done, but I\'m not enamoured with GURPS as a
system, which may be a personal thing. However, it isn\'t a *bad* system,
and appears to work okay.

Quick, call off the dogs of war. Stop the fleet! What do you mean they\'ve

Don\'t worry..... it hadn\'t been enough posts to be truly annoying.

I am often reminded of old saying "an armed society is a polite society"
when reading posts on this list. We are all "armed," in a certain sense,
when it comes to such nettiquette faux pas as trolling, flaming and the
like. By simply avoiding refraining from saying what immediately comes to
mind, I think much misery can be avoided (when misery is defined as a high
noise-to-content ratio on the TML).

It is not what you said or what you meant, but what the other person
*thinks* you meant that counts. Of course, you can\'t always account for
what other people might think, but you can certainly minimize your risk by
following some simple rules.

Here is a very concise, unbiased webpage on the subject:

http://www.primenet.com/~vez/neti.html

A web search will turn up thousands more like it (my Alta Vista search
turned up 49,635 of them).

Many of the higher-visibility posters who also avoid verbal assault follow
these rules, and it serves *everyone* well (after all, who\'d want to be on
the receiving end of an insult someone the likes of Leonard or Anthony
could come up with?).


Part the second -- ObTrav

Where can I find some good, reality-checked figures for fuel consumption
for an int comb (diesel) power plant. I was trying to build an M113 in MT
and kept on coming up with outrageous figures (the .16 MW power plant had a
consumption rate of 10 liters/hour -- at this rate, an M113\'s
three-hundred-something liter fuel tank would allow it to run for much
longer than it does in the real world).

FFS1 gives different figures, but they also seem suspect (too high, IIRC).
Alas, I have not FFS2.

BTW: I haven\'t checked GURPS Vehicles 2 ed. yet, either. This is mostly
because of a) laziness, and b) the icky US measurements it uses (personal
preference only, YMMV).

Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hmm... actually I am very interested in some info... not necessarily the whole
nine yards (though others here might be).  Alot will vary due to differing
design procedures, but i\'m very interested in the displacement (volume) and
the description.  Also the basics, like weaponry.  I know what RCVG says the
main weapon is and the troop capacity.  Just if there are secondary or
tertiary weapons but don\'t need game info.  Just enough to design a relatively
faithful FF&S conversion.  I appreciate it.

    'body' => '    I do not use GURPS game system, and I bought the GT books just 

	for the background material. I found the text content to be 

	quite good, but there is some problems:


- - Remember: this IS a differeng gaming system.  GURPS had been around a long
time before they picked up the Trav contract.  Some of your objections amount
to, "It\'s not CT."  Which is true, it\'s not.  Also, all the problems you
raised are discussed in the G:T book.  A certain annoying person asked "what
sucks" about it; the answer is, it\'s different.


	1) GT uses alternative background setting. I have been playing 
	Traveller for a long time, and have absolutely no intention of 
	switching into alternative timeline. This means that only those 
	parts of the GT backgroud dealing with pre-rebellion times are 
	relevant to me.


- - As far as I can see (from the books that are already out) the only
difference is the non-Rebellion and non-Virus.  That\'s really restricted to a
few sidebars.  If you want Dulinor to off Strephon, go for it!  He might still
do it IMTU... (See the intro on p4.)


	2) GURPS uses old measurement system (feet, pound, furlongs per 
	fortnight, etc), and sometimes mixes them with SI-system 
	(kW/cubic feet, etc). Descriptions of OIU measurement units and 
	their SI conversions can still be found in dictionaries, but
	sometimes there is multiple definitions for one measurement 
	unit with different values (English, US and Russian definitions 
	may differ).


- - I agree.  Too bad I live in such a backward country, but here in the US,
most people just get confused by metric units.  People are stubborn.  SJG is a
US company, and they\'re publishing for a (mostly) US market.  I guess they had
to compromise.  (See the sidebar on p13.)


	3) GURPS copied the idea of technology levels form Traveller,
	but uses different scale. In GURPS Traveller they replaced the 
	original Traveller Tech Levels with their own versions, thus 
	making it harder to use old Traveller material with GT.


- - I have long suspected that GURPS borrowed tech levels from Trav.  It is true
that G:T TL is incompatable with CT TL.  But then again, it\'s compatable with
the hundreds of GURPS books already published.  I guess they had to
compromise.  (See the conversion chart on p107.)


Also, to reply to AveNelso:

    I have the feeling that if stats

    were point based in Traveller everyone would end up with a SOC score of
either

    2 or 12--I mean unless you\'re noble, what\'s the point wasting points on
SOC.

    For me, it\'s just not Traveller without the Traveler character gen system.

- - That\'s not the case in my PbeM.  We have a minor noble (Status 2 = SOC 11)
and four ordinary people (Status 0 = SOC 7 maybe.)  What you\'re describing is
called (among gamers) "munchkinism."  It\'s true, designed characters can be
optimized, and some people (mostly kids) enjoy winning more than they enjoy
role-playing.  But most of my players are over 25, and have outgrown that kind
of behavior.   Over on rec.games.frp.gurps, they discuss munchkinism all the
time.  The answer, usually, is that kids under 12 should stick to D+D.
Subtlety is for grownups.

In GURPS, Status and Wealth and Reputation are separate items; so instead of
having a flat "SOC 9," you could be a rich merchant (high Wealth), or a poor
noble (high Status), or even a penniless drifter who is hailed as a hero (high
Reputation).  All of these might be "SOC 9," but they are very different
social locations.

FFS2 gives .25 m^3/hr/MW for an regular and Improved IC, for your .16 MW
plant, that comes out to 40 l/hr. The Advanced IC has .20 m^3/Hr/MW,
giving 32 l/hr. With a 300l fuel tank that gets you about 8-10 hours of
running time. Since I don;t know what the RW figures are, I don\'t know
if this is realistic or not.

Sadly, none of the extant systems really model RW engines well, because
the model\'s too coarse. Are we talking about diesel, gasoline, ethanol
powered? Fuel Injected or carburetted? Normal, turbo- or supercharged
aspiration? On the road or off road? Heavy or light vehicle?

All of these factors drastially affect fuel consumption. I could
probably design several different RW powerplants and vehicles, all with
the same nominal power output, that would all have different fuel
consumption.

  What part of "various Imperial grav tanks" do you not understand? :)  FWIW,
I think the MT all-round armour design step is third-rate, as any thesis that
supports grav tanks simply fails to address ground-based suspensions and the
(historical) vehicles they create (i.e., M1\'s, T-72\'s, M-113\'s, T-34\'s, etc).

>FF&S takes a much more believable approach by allowing you to slope and vary
>the armor.  :-P 

  Yeah, but I\'ll probably stick with Striker and make the best parts of FF&S1
reverse compatible. FF&S1 is, IMHO, a _very_ good book; technology-wise, it\'s
also pretty much a campaign-design sourcebook, whether you want cyberpunk, a
2300 AD clone, or any of the myriad Trav worlds at any point in their histories.

DGP\'s figures are suspect*, but here is the pertinant info on the Lancer:

Disp=20(!!!), for a volume of 270 kl.
Config=1SL; streamlined wedge.
Armor=50G, equal to 80 cm hard steel.
Mass Unloaded=251 tons, Loaded=258 tons
RPY-15 Rapid Pulse Fusion Gun x 1
TL-13 Beam Laser (25 MW power req.) x 1 (maybe x 2, since there are 3 gunners).
Crew=5 (driver, commander, 3 gunners)
Passengers=25

*One of the main gripes I have about 101 Vehicles are that the vehicles
described therein are just too big for their corresponding illustrations
(and in many cases, their described functions).

For example, the Lancer, if one is to believe the illustration, looks to be
about 12 m long and 2 m high. On top of this is a turret about 5 m long and
1 m high. Pulling numbers out of the air and I will assume these two boxes
are 2/3 as wide as they are high. Doing some quick math with lots of
rounding up, you still get a total vehicle volume of only about 210 kl.
And the Lancer is not even a box, but a wedge (with correspondingly less
volume).

The G:T errata states that the last column on the TURRET AND BAY TABLES
on pp 151 sould read "Internal Spaces".  This now cleary states that
Bays use 20 internal spaces and turrets use one internal space.

The ARMAMENT TABLE on page 156 shows that the bay holds a 50 space bay
weapon. The text states that: "Bay weapons may occupy an entire bay or
take up space in the hull".

So fully movable (360 degree mount) bays are 20 spaces inside the hull,
and 30 spaces outside. Limited (45 degree swivel mount) movement bays
use 50 internal spaces.

Thanks Bruce. I think these figures are about what it they were in FFS1,
IIRC, so maybe it\'s not so far off. The operational range of the M113 seems
to indicate that it has about a 7-8 hour duration, so maybe it isn\'t *too*
far off after all.

I\'ll have to scrap the MT pwrplnt figures, though. Interestingly, before
they errataed the MT fuel consumption figures (because they were "too
inefficient") a .16 MW improved int comb pwrplnt. used about 50
liters/hour. Hmm.

BINGO! This is one of my two big complaints about GURPS in general.

> I dislike  modifier driven games and prefer the change the task difficulty > option.

I tried to get discussion leading up to this topic here a couple of
months ago and we had a few posts, but I got busy elsewhere and didn\'t
follow things up.  

IAC, what do you think of the following idea for a GURPS task
system...particularly a system for GT?

Task Task
Mod  Level
- ----
 +6  Easy
 +3  Routine
  0  Normal
 -3  Difficult
 -6  Formidable
 -9  Staggering
- -12  Hopeless

Determine the difficulty of a Task and add the modifier to the
appropriate Skill or Attribute and other modifiers, then roll against
3d6.

Example:  

1.  Ricardo (skill 14) attempts to gain control of an air-raft
spinning out of control. 

	[Formidable, Grav-Craft, Immediate]

	14 - 6 = 8, Success on a roll of <= 8 (~25% chance of success)

2.  Jaren (skill 10) attempts a simple landing of an air-raft

	[Routine, Grav-Craft, Immediate]

	10 + 3 = 13, Success on a roll <= 13 (~83% chance of success)

3.  Kelly (skill 11) attempts to pick a simple lock in the dark with
an average toolset.

	[Routine, Lockpicking, 2 min]
	[ mods: -2 levels for the dark..task becomes Difficult]

	11 - 3 = 8, Success on a roll <= 10 (~25% chance of success)

The modifiers could be different, of course, and they could be taken
from the die side rather than the skill side, but my gut feeling is
that this would work.

Now, my other big problem with the GURPS system is the point based
character generation system. This is entirely a matter of taste.
Although it seems perfectly serviceable (given proper GM supervision)
it just isn\'t a system *I* prefer.  The fix for that is to develop
some Traveller style Career systems for GT...and that is a Staggering
task! ;->

Sounds like you\'ve never been to JRTC (maybe NTC, too?) in the Army.  They
give you a first aid pouch at the beginning of the conflict with a sealed
card in it telling you where your wound is located, how it debilitates you,
and what will happen to you if you aren\'t treated in a certain period of
time.

My S-2 officer let two enemy OPFOR that a certain crazy specialist had
captured (not me) expired from their wounds without interrogating them, per
SOP.  I believe their wounds kept them from running, but they could shoot
people if they got hold of a weapon.

would love to be a part of this type of project, and find it very
interesting indeed.  You can count in my support for one system at

a little more spread out.

	One other item I would like to add my two credits worth into.  I think
that the \'basic\' interface for the sites on this \'jump ring\' should form
a similar appearance.  One of the best options that I can think of off
my head is a frames based \'front end\'.  Each site conforming to a given
specification in regards to the frame\'s location, size, color, content,
etc.  would help in giving the navigational tour a more modernized and
uniform appearance as you might think you would find in a library data
handbook, or TAS membership brochure.

	Think of how they transferred information in Star Trek TNG.  They used
data pads which were custom configured for the application.  They were
all the same data pad type, with the same basic functions (kinda like
windows or MacOS), just the content is a little different held in the
main frame.

	I have cooked up an example of what I am talking about if anyone is
interested in looking at the site.  Again this is only an example, and
could be changed anyway we would see fit.  The example is at:

I agree, completely!  

But now that *we*, the Traveller Community, are potential consumers of
GURPS, *we* can bitch and complain and try to convince SJGs to come up
with Trav style character generation systems for us.  Or more likely
to succeed, create them ourselves.  

The character generation process needs to generate numbers for skills
and attributes (personally, I\'m not a fan of only having 4...and 2 of
them being *so* important) that work with the rest of the system. As I
posted earlier, creating good Career style systems is a Staggering
task, but not an impossible one.

I can never forget my complaints.  "The Anti-Gunner" was a Soviet Intel

he tried to fire it.

Ob. Trav, are hi-TL energy weapons idiot proof?

Thats a fair criticism of Traveller chargen, in general.  And why I much
prefer extended chargen.  I made some stuff for extended Naval T4 chargen
and still have drafts of how to do extended chargen for all of the basic
T4 careers.  One more thing in the "To Do" list.

Hmm.  Thats interesting.  It is certainly demonstrably easier to increase your
Strength than to increase your Intelligence, so there is a good case for this.
In a SF campaign, there are actually good reasons to have a high strength:
minimize effect of muscle atrophy in Zero-G, tolerate higher G environments
(different than tolerating Gs from acceleration which has more to do with
Head-to-Heart distance than muscle mass).

Yep. Ultimately it comes down to choice. Some people enjoy playing a
character that the dice gave them, while others enjoy characters they
carefully crafted.

I personally think that T5 should include both in its character creation
system. I\'ve always thought that the random character creation helped with
the "feel" of Traveller, and to a large extent I\'ve missed it, expecially
with G:Traveller (the article in Pyramid was a nice starting point to coming
up with a new one).

On the other hand, I also enjoy crafting characters from time to time, and I
wouldn\'t mind if the option was open in a preplaytested fashion. Ultimately
I\'d like to see two systems that come out ultimately balanced. You can point
build a character that\'s a little above "character" average, or you can roll
and get one that\'s in between.

I fundamentally disagree with your argument that advantages and
disadvantages help with roleplaying as opposed to rollplaying. In fact, such
systems ultimately open themselves up to munchkinizing. "Welp, I\'ve got this
blind, albino leprous dwarf with one eye, but check out his hand to hand
skill!" That\'s not to say the system is broken, but that ROLLplayers can
find a way to ply their trade in any system. Then again, so can ROLEplayers.

The full datasheet can be found in MegaTraveller Journal#3. 

From memory (I designed it years ago), 54 kL volume, 11 to 2 tonnes mass
(varies with tech level), and about 9kCr. (This is for the sealed model.) 
Dimensions were 3x3x6 metres.

I will add the description (and design) to revision 2 of 101 Starships and
102 Vehicles.

Um...might I point out that mechanically speaking, there really isn\'t any
fundamental difference between task-based systems and modifier-based systems? 
Its just a question of the difference in the signs.  If you really want to you
can swap the numbers out -- instead of normal success requiring rolling under
your skill on 3d6, have it require 21+ on 3d6+skill.  You have to muck with the
critical success/failure system slightly, but otherwise its statistically
identical.

Shrug.  Depends on your definition of \'idiot\'.  In GURPS traveller, a
well-maintained energy weapon will have a malfunction of Ver., which means in
order to malfunction you need to critically fail on your attack roll (slightly
under 2% chance for most people) and _then_ fail an additional skill check. 
For someone halfway trained with a gun (skill 12, say), it works out to around
0.5%; someone totally untrained (using default skill of 6) will fail around
4.5% of the time.  If this fails the weapon is jammed...and isn\'t horribly
difficult to unjam.

However, a sufficiently talented idiot can break any weapon system.

Unlike some parts of the world the EU has some (often extensive)
consumer protection legislation - no Maxwell House 13 oz pounds of
coffee over here.  The product described as "jam" is made from fruit and
certain amounts of added sugar, but the Portuguese make something
similar from carrots (ugh!) so to comply with the regulations about the
contents of jam etc, carrots are fruit.

Likewise some people are upset that British chocolate (which often seems
as though it has never been near a cocoa bean, and consists in large
part of vegetable and milk fats) is called chocolate, and they want it
called "vegelate".  Continental chocolate contains much higher levels of
cocoa butter and is much richer - I can only get through 3 bars of
Suchard dark chocolate before feeling queasy, whereas I\'m sure I could
attempt a 1 kg Cadbury\'s in one sitting.

This is very similar to the system I use for my GURPS Traveller game.  I 
also use a chart with the same numbers to determine the degree of 
success (i.e. making a roll by 3 is an extra degree of success while 
making the roll by 6 is two extra degrees of success).

Better re-print a copy then. I think your data is out of date. I just
looked at the most current one, dated Feb 9, 1999, and it clearly
calls, in that same page, for the bays to be 50 internal spaces.

That\'s my job, Bruce. ;->  This comes from an event in the PBEM I\'m
running. Someone planted an explosive in the air-raft the party was
flying. It blew out one of the 4 grav-units and threw the raft into a
nose down spin at 1000m.

And the task in the game *was* harder than a simple Formidable roll,
smoke from the fire and having one quadrant of the raft blown out made
the task Staggering instead of Formidable for one thing. If you want a
task breakdown here\'s what Ricardo was up against...overcome surprise
(Difficult) at the explosion to act quickly, then control the nose
down spin (Staggering), then get control of the drop in altitude
(Formidable) and *then* get the raft over the trees into that open
field (Difficult), and he only had so many chances at each task before
time ran out. He almost *didn\'t* get control of the spin, but I won\'t
tell you how close a thing that was...or if I had to fudge any rolls.

of unrepresentative and unresponsive Member World governments
with the attitude \'so move!\' - or perhaps it would be more
appropriate to characterize it as \'love it or leave it\'.  It is
saddening to think that anyone could be so ill-informed of the
state of affairs in our Imperium to believe that this is a viable
solution for everyone.  True, passage off-world - off any world -
is only Cr1000.  True, the Ministry of Colonization is supportive
of all efforts to build new lives and new worlds.  But
colonization is not for everyone, and there are worlds that
control immigration, and worlds that control emigration.  And it
is the Member Worlds that control ingress and egress to the
starports - there is no requirement that a Member World admit any
specific person to their territory, and the Starport Authority
has neither the jurisdiction nor the will to compel planetary
authorities to permit any of its own citizens to enter the
extraterritoriality zone of the starport.  Clearly, the
admonition to vote with one\'s feet is simplistic, to the point of
being useless and wrong.

This is followed by a comparison of Imperial culture with that of
the surrounding states.  In the case of the non-human cultures,
The Old Marquis ignores the fundamentally different psychology
that accompanies the fundamentally different physiology, and
reduces each race to a caricature - a technique favored by
racists throughout the Imperium, and by the \'government\' of the
rebellious Solomani Sphere.  As to the human cultures of the
Zhodani and the Solomani, it is clear to anyone even minimally
schooled in psychology that their actions are less those of a
tyrannical minority than of a culture that is largely unwilling
to face change - they hide behind conformity, and claim that
non-conformity is \'treason\' or \'illness\' or any of a whole host
of other negative behaviors.  Would The Old Marquis have us
follow them into fear of change?  Change is not to be feared; it
is to be embraced when needed, and carefully considered always.

Then, the straw man of a controlling Imperium is raised - an
interfering one, rather than a responsive one.  The purpose of
the reconstruction of the Imperium is not to control the worlds,
but to act as a check on them - to prevent them from oppressing
their own people, and to ensure that the benefits of Imperial
membership come to the world.  Cultural uniformity is not the
aim, nor is it to be desired, except to the extent that it may be
a natural outgrowth of exposure to offworld influences.  But that
is all that we speak of: influence.  Never has the Imperium
directly ruled worlds; never shall this be its purpose.  The
cultural diversity that The Old Marquis celebrates is indeed one
of our strengths; there is nothing to be gained by attempting to
control it.  The new Imperial mission is to respond to the
expressed needs and desires of the people; not to dictate them.
It is only in this manner that the Imperium can overcome its
weaknesses, and promote its own unity.

    'body' => 'Prometheus paints a dark picture of our Imperium, attributing
nepotism, politics, and assassination to the Iridium Throne;
corruption, greed, and secrecy to the Imperial establishment;
thuggery, despotism, and injustice to the Member Worlds.  This is
followed by a bombastic essay that falls little short of a call
to bloody revolution, in the best tradition of the demagogues
that are named as a symptom of the Imperium\'s problems.

Let it be noted that, while there _are_ revolutionary movements,
they are few and far between, and aimed generally at the
governments of specific Member Worlds, rather than at the
Imperium as a whole.  Certainly, these movements are not as
ubiquitous as Prometheus would have us believe; such
revolutionary activity would require the whole of Imperial force
to put down, sparing none for even border actions against Vargr
raiders.  Clearly, this is not the case; and it takes little
effort for one who wishes to truly be informed to determine that
the Imperium is largely peaceful.  Prometheus brings us fire, in
the tradition of the chosen name, but instead of bringing it as a
gift to man, a tool that can be used for mankind\'s betterment, it
is brought as a weapon, and a force of destruction.  The original
Prometheus was punished by the gods for giving man the tool; our
Prometheus is merely a man, and can be punished by mankind for
bringing untruth, distortion, and destruction.

Yet even in such blatant distortion, there is an element of
truth: the Warrant can as easily be a recipe for enabling
despotism as one for enlightened autocracy.  We have been
fortunate in that, for the most part, enlightened autocracy has
been our lot.  But what of the future?  Could not an ambitious
younger Imperial Heir Prospective, eager for power and disdainful
of the rights of elder siblings or the Crown itself, use the very
tactics Prometheus decries to gain the Imperial Power, and abuse
it to personal benefit?

The Warrant served to promote the gestation of our nascent
Imperium, and to provide a framework within which it could grow.
But the Imperium has outgrown it; no longer are we in the womb of
consolidation, or the childhood of expansion.  We have reached,
if not our maturity, our adolescence, and the rules must change
for an adolescent.  We are ready now to take on additional
responsibility, but we still require a firm hand of guidance -
perhaps more than formerly, as we test our limits in many ways.
This is, ultimately, the heart of the need to restructure the
Imperium, and for the Imperium to take a more activist stand.

But that does not mean that we must abolish the current
structure.  Prometheus calls it a \'foundation...built in sand\';
Dilgaadin attributes to it \'long habit\' that \'almost invariably
reasserts itself\'.  Perhaps there is something to be said for
both views.  But to create a new unity would add mortar to the
sand, strengthening it, and habit can be broken through the
development of replacement behavior.  More, to retain the extant
structures minimizes the stresses that will be added to those
that necessitate the changes proposed.  To do more is foolish; it
places at risk the entire Imperium.  A course of moderate change
is the best way to strengthen our Imperium, that the past
thousand years shall be like a single day in comparison to its
future.

  {
    'body' => 'Fellow Sophonts:

I have been reading the current debate on Imperial political structure and
policy, and I have to point out one glaring flaw in this arguement.
Thuycidides has obviously taken the "Vilani-traditionalist" point of view. My
ancestors have shown the Vilani the errors of this line of thought. Gallatin
has an intereresting line of thought; i.e. the correction of the planetary
"hands-off" policy. I agree that this is desirable, but he doesn\'t go far
enough. I have a radical new preposal: FEDERATION!

I propose that the the entire Imperial political structure be revamped. An
interstellar Feudal aristocracy does not work for one main reason. It\'s
hereditary, and is thus vunerable to the great flaw of inherited rank-
mediocrety. Eventually unsuitable and/or incompetant persons inherit the
position, and are rarely removed form their positions. It\'s after all, human
nature (and probably Vargr nature, and and other races for that matter...)
that those brought up in priviledge eventually become spoiled and pampered and
neglect their responsibilities, since the are not held accountable for the job
they do. As long as they keep the "lid on" and don\'t let their subsector fall
apart, they can ignore paperwork for the vacation palace....

Thus I propose that the Imperium adopt a WRITTEN constitution, with carefully
deliniated Imperial-Federal powers, checks and balances, and limits and
responsibilities between the Federal-Imperial powers, and the local-"state"
powers. I use as an example of an excellent working Constitution, with a
proven track record; the Constitution of the Ancient Terran nation state of
the United States of America. This nation state lasted from it\'s inception all
the way untill it\'s absorption into the unified planetary government (of which
I may add the American governmental system had a major influence).

The American Constitution had a representive legislative body (with two houses
to protect the rights of both states with large populations, and states with
small populations), an elected chief executive to enforce laws created by the
legislative, and a judicial that reviewed these laws to determine their
constitutionality. The constition purposely designed these three bodies as a
system of "checks and balances". Lastly (and as many have considered this the
most important part of the document) there was a "bill of rights" attached,
which listed a series of basic rights of each citizen. Government couldn\'t
violate these rights, and most importantly in regrards to this debate: states
couldn\'t write laws or commit acts that violated the Federal constitution.
This allowed the Federal government to interviene in state affairs to protect
citizens and the constitution. 

In addition, I propose that Imperial and local nobles/officials be elected by
a popular vote of all adult Imperial citizens of each appropriate area.

As an example, we will take the case of Terra. We see a pyrimidal structure
(local municipalities, nation states, planetary government, subsector, sector,
domain, Imperial). At each level, elected officials govern, and their are
legislatures made up of elected persons representing the entire region). Thus
a person living in North America votes for executives and legislatures at all
levels: local. planetary, etc.). Thus at the Imperial level, we would have an
elected President (or some other name for the position), and a congress that
represented the entire Imperium. The Emperor would either have accept a
figurehead position (like many ancient Terran nation states after they
democratised), or allow the position to become elected. For the sake of
Imperial cultural continuence, I suggest the former idea...This would take
place at all levels of Imperial politics: all political positions MUST be
elected and non hereditary...

I realize that this is a very controversial position, that even most of my
Solomani brethren don\'t share. I submit to them that Solomani aren\'t destined
to rule all other humans, but that Solomani government (via representive
democracy) is...Commentary and/or criticsm is welcome...

From what Marc sent out a while back there will be an alternate system for
designing characters where you choose the age of the character and you get
told what default skills you\'d have for that career plus how many skill

A wee bit American-centred aren\'t we? An ISBN, as such, doesn\'t matter a
damn to most of the countries in the world. They rely on standard copyright
laws - which America has its own version of. Its the copyright that counts -
and you don\'t need to do anything for that to apply.

It doensn\'t have to.  Isn\'t the G:T TNS entry announcing his intent to elevate
Norris (and Isis?) *after* he would\'ve been assassinated by Dulinor, in the
OTU, which could\'ve been what Strephon was going to have done anyways, if he
hadn\'t been plugged by Dulinor.

Even assuming there was a massive preparation beforehand, there\'s nothing to
say it didn\'t happen that way for the OTU, either.  For example, OTU timeline:
Strephon sends notice to Norris to get his crap together and on such and such
date he\'s going to announce his intention to make him Archduke of Deneb.  Keep
quiet, a task force is en route, blah blah.  Norris gets the message and gets
ready.  Dulinor pays his little visit to Capital in the OTU.  The task force
gets there, but there\'s no trigger signal or instead (though I\'m assuming
there\'s no cruiser like the Sargon sent, and but rather a J4 naval task force
[Dulinor\'s Sargon is said to be J6, though it could be a "cruiser" in the
Broadsword sense instead of the Azhanti High Lightning]) one of the TJs gets
to Norris and the Domain nobility, where they gather to discuss "economic
matters" (in another TNS entry).  Norris hangs on to the task force and
sequesters the crews.   Norris forges the patent of nobility.

Well, the official announcements about G:T (especially the web page) all lead
me to believe that it\'s the same background up to 132-1116, the same
undercurrents that lead to the Rebellion are still stewing (though it won\'t
happen Imperium wide cause of the contract), there\'s just no Assassination,
which doesn\'t unravel the whole thing.  Strephon\'s program to strengthen the
Domains continues.

The alternate universe was postulated as part of the \'ground
rules\'.  Remember that in the "real" universe/TNE direction,
Dulinor killed Strephon not long after receiving the archducal
coronet.  In the "real" universe/GURPS Traveller direction,
Dulinor died in what would have been his assassination mission.
There wasn\'t _time_ in either universe for this debate.  That\'s
why I had to postulate a third time line.  The rest of your
commentary is interesting, and might have validity - but either
way would preclude this kind of debate having happened, simply on
the time factor.

Well, yes - but that has such major ramifications.  It\'s what the
gang over in soc.history.what-if calls a "point of departure" or
POD.  Things progress _differently_ from that changed event.

There\'s the issue of regicide.  Norris was clearly loyal to the
Imperium in the abstract, and to Strephon personally (this can be
gleaned from Arrival Vengeance).  That would change his attitude
in the Rebellion universe - not to mention the danger of the AV
mission to start with - a detour to Dlan may not have been
justifiable.  With no regicide, Norris might have been (is) less
set against Dulinor, and willing to discuss the issues.  Again,
the One Event makes a difference.

In a way, that\'s what makes threads like this so interesting (at
least to me) - it\'s an opportunity to explore the possibilities
of What-Might-Have-Been in depth, and, in hindsight, makes the
decision to split the timeline a good one.

Maybe when this thread winds down, I\'ll do some research, and
find some other PODs for discussion...

LOL.    No flames, but best?  Um... faster, quieter (engine), better main gun,
better fire control system (at night, too... the thermals we use are alot
better than the FLIR on the 60s).  Longer max eff. range.  Thicker and DU
armor.  And we heft bigger & heavier rounds than you ever had to do, for the
personal stuff.  :-)   Now mind you, i\'ve already stated my opinion of the
M1A2 and you probably only saw vanilla M1s...

Course if you\'re referring to the army types, they\'re training is really going
down hill.  Almost felt sorry for some of em when we left the Armor Inn
littered w/ their bodies.  And some genius thought up a hand to hand training
encounter...it lasted a whole 5 seconds w/ some poor soldier getting his arm
broken.  Then some good brawling in Radcliffe (Sparky\'s on "legs night") and
Louisville (some frat house party).  Fortunately, we never got caught (always
boogied out before the MPs got there), though CO told us to stop messing w/
the soldiers once (and our NCOs were alot less... diplomatic... about it, to
put it mildly).  In fact, I remember the big ruckuss that arose when we...
acquired... one of their guidons right before one of their ceremonies...
*That* was amusing.   :-)  Next up would be the time they were marching to
chow (must\'ve been the *4th* damn time that same company recycled while I was
there) and we were in the way and had no intention of moving (word to the
wise, don\'t EVER try to break a unit\'s ranks).

I remember when there were some Canadian Marines (which I didn\'t know existed
prior to seeing some) hanging around Knox for awhile, we thought something
would end up going down, but they wouldn\'t let us near each other, though some
of their NCOs came to one of the classes to share knowledge.  Ahem, I digress
too far...

Usually.  Course zero times 2 is still 0.  That Kentucky windage you old
timers used just isn\'t as good w/ a really fast tank.  We pull up the battle
override and zoom!  lol.  Seriously, I know what u mean, but hull down can\'t
put a longer range on ones guns.

T80s?  C\'mon...  A hunk of trash.  LOL.   We can hit them and an M60 outside
of those tank\'s max effective range.  I know the mech\'s always complain that
the hogs never had the "black box type" electronics boxes and could fiddle w/
everything.  Trackwork (ugh) is supposed to be alot easier on 60s, too.  Add
all that extraneous stuff and we won\'t break a sweat on M60s, T80s, T90s too.
We know all the weaknesses on the old hogs too.  Remember the Marines were
using them up to and including the Gulf, though one batallion (IIRC), of the 4
USMC tank bn\'s, got M1s at the time.

Imperial Marines?  Meteoric assault.  Blow everything to hell.  Leave.
Imperial Army comes in somewhere along the line and garrisons the joint.

That\'s me; I suppose that now would be an appropriate time to
make a general announcement:

It appears that the service hosting Freelance Traveller has
either crashed hard (i.e., mucho hardware replacement necessary)
or folded up shop and gone away.  I\'m frankly not surprised
(though disappointed); from its TOS it was clearly a charity site
(i.e., nobody was paying for it).  I\'m in the process of locating
other space for it, hopefully with TOS that will not be too
repugnant in terms of required links, banners, pop-ups, et
cetera, and with adequate space and support for CGI and/or
FrontPage.

I\'m working as fast as I can on this...

I tend to agree with you.  What does ACQ have?

Months ago, someone on TML had a quick and dirty way
to do it.  IIRC, he used a bullseye overlay, with a roll to see
exactly where you hit.  It was centered mid-torso if no location
specified, otherwise, on the desired location.  It may have had
diffent bullseyes for different body parts,


If someone\'s got that, could you repost it?

Umm, how do you "unjam" an energy weapon?

While we\'re at it, could the average TL-15 energy pistol be turned into
a grenade by the Star Trick of putting it on "overload"?

These rules are intended for Quick NPC generation, but work just as well
for Quick PC generation.  I love \'em.  You can pick the skills you want
(always an option IIRC), not worry about survival and injury rolls, etc.

Also interesting are the under-18 chargen rules.

OOPs, sorry.  The correct URL is:
http://ww3.ncweb.com/scspieker/traveller/websector/index.html

	One thing I would like to point out.  I am starting my own ISP
business, and I would like to offer some web space for anyone who would
like to join this project.  I can even offer to host an entire server to
this project.  The ISP business will be turned up May 1.
	I would suggest that we make this a first step by making one or two
sites, then as the ISP rolls out, then we move those sites into the
proper positions on the dedicated Traveller server.  The new service is
called FiberStream.net (if anyone really cares).
	I would also like to offer to store any traveller related web sites
and/or resources on that server as well.  One stipulation of course,
there has to be some form of virus scanning stage within the process of
posting items.

I\'ll look over the map and see if I can think of an interesting spot to
start at.  I think the initial location should be a group decision,
since we are trying to generate interest in others joining the effort as
well.  No sense in picking some place that is already detailed to death.
IMHO.

	Does anyone else have an opinion of where to start?

	You do not see that the advantage the Imperium has, in respect to the
happiness and liberty of its citizens,  over the other great powers is the
freedom from a governmental orthodoxy.   If the Imperium chooses any
interventionist policy in local affairs to check "local oppression", then who
is to define "local oppression"?   If the Imperial government can interfere at
will, then whose will operates?   If the government choose a program for
change, then who charts that direction?   An interventionist policy either
leads to a policy mandated from Core, leading to the same ideological
orthodoxy present in all the other great powers; or it leads to a patchwork of
local action where local "committees" or "councils" or "governors" intervene
in world events, which would lead us to chaos, the breakdown of standard trade
and communications and Vargr-like instability.
	The empire is to large, the population too large to make an elected official
any more of a true "representative" than the nobles currently are.  You have
complained of the unchecked power of megacorporations, but who is more
independent of megacorp control, a noble with estates and income of his own,
or a local politician who must look to funding his next election?
	You have asked me whether I would join the Zhodani in fearing change.  I
would ask you whether you would join the Hivers in putting your vision of the
future over the wishes of trillions of sentients?  The Imperium exists for the
security of the member worlds and the maintenance of trade among them.   Yes,
I fear a change in that arrangement,  just as I would fear a bodyguard who
begins to question my methods of educating my children, or an accountant who
had the power to comit me to an asylum.
	Finally, you have stated that "Cultural uniformity is not the
aim, nor is it to be desired"  but the problem is that when someone is given
the power to intervene "for a good cause", when the "cause" is gone, the power
always, yes always, remains.  When power is available, it will one day be
used.  The power to intervene in world affairs will invariably and unavoidably
lead to a greater and greater conformity across all the member worlds, at the
point of the bayonet.  It will not be fast, it will not proceed at a uniform
rate, but it is unavoidable.

	Gentlebeing, you are mad.    If the Imperium had one "representative" per
world, the "Senate"--yes I believe that was the old Terran term--would have
10,000 members.  I don\'t even want to begin to count how many representatives
would be needed if we wanted any type of real, responsive legislature.  
	Nothing prevents a world today from having a democartic system, many worlds
do,  but the only hope for a free empire lies with a "hands-off approach" to
what goes on on a world.  Replacing nobles, who look to the long term, with
opportunistic politicians who must needs be responsive to temporary passion
and powerful monied interests, would lead us to  a peak of corruption and
conflict.  The greed of the Terran Confederation legislature led to the
creation of the Second Imperium\'s noble regime in the first place. 
	 It is a comforting conceit among those in popular societies that aristocrats
are drooling twits. But there are thousands of examples of vibrant, long-lived
aristocracies, while democracies rarely last more than a few centuries.  Also,
democratic societies are not necessarily more humane or intelligent than
aristocratic ones.  Since you are fond of Ancient Terra, look at the conflict
between the early states of Athens and Sparta.  The Athenians were democartic,
yet they were arrogant, wasteful, foolish, tyrannical to their allies,
merciless to their enemies and eventually lost the war.  The Spartans were
aristocratic, yet individually they were widely known as honest, courageous
and virtuous.  The Spartans treated their allies well and were merciful to
their enemies, and in the end spared defeated Athens, when the rest of Greece
demanded its destruction.

Not sure what the average energy pistol is.  In any case, its probably easier
to just remove the power source and set that off.  Basically, for high energy
weapons powered by an EPG/PPG/FPG, you can set off single shots (with roughly
the same effect as single shots from the weapon), multiple shots would probably
be a tricky demolitions job to make work together.  Some forms of batteries
(particularly rapid discharge batteries) will explode.  Any HPG or capacitor
can probably explode, though the yield probably won\'t be very impressive; these
are typically part of the weapon rather than part of the power source, but can
probably be easily removed.  GT power cells by the rules can\'t explode, though
realistically they should explode quite violently, as they are capable of
near-instantaneous discharge and have enormous power densities.  The fuel tanks
for chemical fuel lasers will probably catch fire if punctured, and could
probably be coerced to explode more vigorously.

I suggest reading the MTJ (IIRC, could be TD) by Joe Fugate on the use of
task levels not DMs.

My personal take is that task levels are more intuitive, and a whole string
of DMs is a pain.

I realise that there isn\'t a big difference, but there\'s a mental leap
between \'that\'s a difficult task\' and roll 3D6 and add/take
<numberofyourchoice>. And that gets in the way. Why have to remember a
whole range of modifiers *for each skill* when you can have a basic roll
which you mod by task difficulty (changing target number or changing the
number of dice).

Eris can probably argue this better than me.

BITS proudly announces the release of GT Shipyard, the latest MacOS
software by Rob Prior. The demonstration version, which is fully funtional
except for save, print and export features, may now be downloaded from the
link off the product page on the BITS website.

http://www.bits.org.uk/

The software implements the GURPS Traveller Sourcebook Modular System
(including errata) and also includes the GT:StarMercs Modules, and the
forthcoming GT:Far Trader Modules. It is operated through an intuitive menu
driven interface, and allows export as text, tabbed text and html. There is
scope to add a further 10 custom module types built in.

Tested under MacOS 7.01 onwards, and on processors from the 68030 onwards,
the quickest way to check compatibility is to download and try the software!

The fully enabled version costs £10 GBP, or $20 USD/CAN and is available
either directly from Rob Prior or from myself, acting on BITS behalf for
Europe.

Just a quick thing: 
I think most poeple don´t really object to what you are saying,
some post are really worthwile, but rather to the way you say some things.
Using words licks sucks, brain-dead, and others like that (you probably get
the drift)
gets people on the edge and makes them respond to you in a similar tone,
which you in turn, don´t seem to like either. 
So what i am suggesting to you is:
Try to be a bit more civil in your posts. 
This is a list of Traveller fans, and most of the time, we think of
ourselves like a big family.
Sure we have our disagreements, but we try to solve them in a civil way,
politely.
Try to talk to us the way you talk to your parents, grandparents, children,
best friends, whatever. 
I am sure the list will respond a lot better to any of your posts in the
future if you do so.

Hi Clif!

I think the "problem" some people are having is that they are used to
*very* polite language on the TML. We have managed to avoid the excesses of
some of the newsgroups, so when someone begins to be even slightly abrupt
or confronting, we are surprised (I know I am surprised if someone even
_swears_ on this list - one nice thing about the TML is that most people
have a wider vocabulary with which they can express their views). That
surprise sometimes turns to defence, if people think they are being
attacked.

The problem, as someone said earlier, is that sarcasm or even friendly
banter doesn\'t translate well to text. We miss the 90% of the message that
comes from the accompanying body language.

People on the TML have, therefore, adopted a certain polite style of
language. For example, instead of asking "What sucks about GURPS?", they
may well phrase it differently: "I\'ve had a brief look at GURPS - can
someone tell me what its bad points are?". This is more understated, but
you should get the same result without getting people\'s backs up (BTW for
those who said "there are NO bad points", I kinda find that a bit hard to
believe - every system has its set of "Murphy\'s Rules" ;-).

Another suggestion is to respond more slowly - for example, the good rules
responses about using Soc vs Law came along in later digests, but I
received them all on the same day. This means that people *were* responding
to your query in the way you wanted them to - you just need to be a little
patient, and allow a few days to pass before saying you didn\'t receive any
useful info. People aren\'t on-line all the time, and anyway it may
(*should*) take some thinking time to come up with good and useful
responses.

The Soc vs Law question you raised started a very interesting thread, and I
know I gained a lot out of it - from quick rules to guidelines for
designing worlds to people\'s views on how the Trav universe could/should
work. The TML is a mine of useful info about Traveller, and this example
demonstrated the excellent range of info that can be gleaned on a
particular topic.

In the Bond system, which uses percentile dice, most of the weapons which
also exist in the real world (not speaking of Q branch gadgets) have jamming
percentages which are so far below the smallest chance of 1% that you
actually have to make the weapon MORE unreliable to permit any opportunity
for jamming into the game system for that particular weapon.  The Walther
PPK is one of the few that has a significant chance of jamming.  From my
experience, the notoriously jam-prone Walther PPK (and variants) do so
because the marksman is not gripping the weapon tightly, which is required
if the blowback operation is to function reliably.  Once you train yourself
to do this, it rarely jams.

Myself being a case in point.  I forgot to put the buffer spring in the
stock of an M-16A1 in A.I.T., when I charged the weapon the... man, I\'ve
forgotten the term...but the piece that houses the firing pin jammed back in
the stock.  This also prevented breaking the weapon open to free it.  I
botched it good.  I seem to recall a scene where the weapon\'s barrel was
being bashed into the floor by a Drill Sergeant in hopes that gravity would
free the firing pin housing.

A nice touch would be to make them look like d12\'s or better still, d20\'s.

I don\'t think we want it all in one place.  For one, wouldn\'t that give some

What have you got against AD&D? Gee, I even wrote up Trav-to AD&D rules!
;-)

To me, "balanced" means "having enough skills in the party to complete the
mission". In AD&D you do this by having different classes, because the
skills are inherent to the class (secondary skills notwithstanding!). In a
skill-based game such as Trav, Rolemaster, or GURPS, it is a lot more
difficult to "balance" the party when you have more skills to choose from.

The danger you need to avoid is to have the party run into something they
do not have the skills to solve, but the MUST be solved if they are to
complete the scenario.

We want to be careful about putting all of the sites on one server, as a
bogged down server will mean that all of the sites are bogged down (unless
you have Windows 2000), and that a server crash will take out the whole
sector at once.  If they are on different servers, then if one server goes
down you can always jump to another world.

Any place where we can attempt to be original in our world creations.

Also, I think that we need to have links for Jump 1 on one page and for Jump
2 on another page, etc., cumulative, of course, as you increase in ship
capability.  A list of world names could be enough to click on to jump and
you could have an alternative "system map" (an image map) would you could
click on worlds to jump there.  A few undefined links could be available for
"misjumps".

I _almost_ agree.  I would word it as, "Point-based is one thing T5

Thats the abomination that the M-60 used in the cupola.  IIRC, a converted
aircraft mg that *allways* jammed at gunnery.

Actually, the M-60A3 TTS had a way better thermal sight than M-1/M-1A1s,
except it seemed a lot less reliable. Whne they worked, however, they gave a
better picture. The ballistic computer was slightly harder to use, but just
as accurate.  I served for 3 years on M-60s and 2 on M-1s.  Both ALLWAYS hit
with every round, given an average gunner and a good boresight.  Also, as my
unit had a lot of oldtimers in it, I got to listen to a lot of nostalgia for
the old APERS round- that and HEP.  The lack of a good anti-personel round
for the M-256 is, IMHO, its only real flaw.

Yeah, the Army thinks ONE day of h-t-h training is sufficient...for
enlisted.  Officers get none (though, a 4 hour block on bayonet fighting,
for "morale").  Whoo-boy.

Just for the Army\'s honor, I would like to point out that 4out of5 USMC
officers i my AOBC class failed the written English test.  The one who
passed was a reservist.  OTOH, Someone from the Tennessee ANG showed up with
his branch insigina on upside-down.

UUh, we had wind sensors, lead, etc.   Note that the M-60A3 wind sensor was

Agreed.  Now, an M-60 in turret defilade from a fighting position can move
up and fire in about 3-4 seconds.  That\'s how long you have to see it, react
and pray.  A T-80, well, it\'s going to take longer, fire slower and less
(much) accurately, and expose more turret.

>We can hit them and an M60 outside
>of those tank\'s max effective range.

Well, a 105 probably wouldn\'t penetrate a M-1A1(HA) frontally at ANY range,
so you\'re probably pretty safe.

 I know the mech\'s always complain that
>the hogs never had the "black box type" electronics boxes and could fiddle

That\'s the M-60A1- coincidence RF and all that.  We had plenty of toys,
though not as many as the M-1.

>Trackwork (ugh) is supposed to be alot easier on 60s, too.

Hallelujah!  Replacing road wheels, too.

OBTRAV:  Do planetary militaries get hand-down Imperial stuff?  Based on the
length (time-wise) of a TL, this could lead to some reserve units with
REALLY old stuff, especially in the interior.  Thinking of that , does Core
sector have subsector navies?  Seems a waste.

By double-checking to ensure that the power source is properly connected
to the weapon.

It depends.  Since one would not expect to see weapons that
spontaneously self-immolate on a routine basis (unless, of course, one
is playing PARANOIA), I can see three ways in which an energy pistol
could be made to blow up "on-call":

1.  The "overload-to-detonation" setting is designed into the weapon,
for just such a use.  IMHO, this is rather implausible, but YMMV.

2.  Setting such a weapon to "overload-to-detonation" requires tinkering
with said weapons innards (and thus a skill roll), based on either skill
in the weapon in question, or Electronics.  Takes a bit more time, but
it\'s more plausible.

3.  An anti-tamper device, built into the weapon, causes catastrophic
self-destruct if the weapon is handled by an unauthorized user.  Not
quite "on-call", but still fairly useful (until enemy troops learn to
leave such weapons alone).

The question is, how much volume will this critter require on my
starship?  The Displacement rating tells me that I have to allot 20
Dtons to move one of these beasts.  In this case, it doesn\'t matter how
any m^3 the actual design displaces, the required cargo space would
likely be a box with dimensions of length x width x height.

I truly hope that you meant that the Deuce failed to follow SOP, which
called for interrogating wounded Enemy Prisoners of War [EPW].  The
other way that this can be interpreted ("IAW SOP, the S-2 did not
interrogate wounded EPW, and instead let them assume room temperature")
implies that your unit had formalized war crimes in its written
policies.

As a 97E with 15 years of service, I would find the latter
interpretation disturbing (mainly because EPW are too good a source of
intelligence to waste!).

ObTrav:  During gaming sessions, I prefer not to handle the
interrogation of captured NPCs (after all, I see no point in taking my
work into a gaming session).  I prefer to watch my fellow players
attempt to question said prisoners, and only step in after they have
failed to gain any useful information.  (I do make sure to have an
interrogation-related skill, so that I can question prisoners
in-character.)

ensued.

I\'ll try and work on Vincennes.  Granted, some of it was done in MTJ, but I
have a few TL-16 designs that I\'d love to post, and this would be a great

I\'m working on one now. Basically it gives a character a base level of points 
which can be used to purchase skills from a "background pool" then you get 
more points per term to purchase from the "career pool". When you fail your 
survival roll you pick up a disadvantage (note there is no "payback" for a 
disadvantage, its just bad luck). And then you get to mustering out points to 
purchase from the "mustering out" pool. I\'ll post it when I\'ve finished it (which 
given that I\'m currently studying for two degrees, running a PBEM, working on 
the UCP and trying to raise two children might be awhile).

Tim,
A website is really great for a PBEM to make sure everyone has the same 
information, and can have a good grasp of the items at hand.
Jesse has one we have been using one just recently for deckplans, and 
have been adding more information to keep the players updated.
It works, and its fun to see it grow...
:)

Actually, I think it is more of a case of SJG finally emptying their

the other two could probably say the same thing.

According to MT ship construction rules you have to allocate 150% of a
vehicle\'s volume for stowage aboard a starship, which I thought was supposed
to take this into account (so you actually need 30 dt for a Lancer). Of
course, I could be wrong about this.

However, the displacement rating -- and the volume derived from it -- is
used to determine things like cargo storage, fuel tankage, passenger space,
and all of that (did I mention that the Lancer also has 5 cubic meters of
cargo space and 30,000 liters of fuel tankage?). In this case, it *does*
matter how much volume the actual design displaces.

Sure, it\'s a matter of 5-6 dt or so, but I would like to have seen the
illustrations reflect the vehicles (and vice versa).

Don\'t get me wrong -- I *love* 101 Vehicles, complete with it\'s cool illos
and all of that. It\'s just that I am frustrated by little details like this.

Someone beat you to it.  Pyramid (SJG\'s online magazine) already ran an
article that merges GURPS with a chargen system similar to Classic
Traveller.  It\'s supposed to create roughly 100-point character after 3-4
tours, although this can vary pretty widely.

If you are a Pyramid subscriber, check out: 

http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.cgi?462

If you aren\'t a subscriber, think about it.  It\'s a good source for general
gaming material and it\'s only $15 a year for something like 200 articles
(3-5 a week).

Indeed it does.  They changed the bleeping errata on me.  Aargh.  Well, at

There will also be a range of standard containers in G:T Far Trader (in

Great!  I am too, sporatically, although I keep getting detoured by

Please do, and if enough of us are interested in Trav-style Chargen
for GT maybe we should be working together on it.  Maybe this is a
subject for a specialty mailing list, like onelist.

The approach I\'m trying to take is going to be more random.  A quick
prelim...

1.  Attributes:  ((2d6)/2 + 7), round up [range 8 to 13, mean 11]
    Not as big a variation as Traveller, but it fits with GURPS, I
    think.

2.  No 1/2 points on skills, and each level is ONE point not a
    variable number.  Skills start at (lower at the player/GM\'s
    option):

      Skill         Level        When there 
    Difficulty       One        is a Default
    ----
     Easy        Attribute      Attribute-2
     Average     Attribute-1    Attribute-3
     Hard        Attribute-2    Attribute-4
     Very Hard   Attribute-3    Attribute-5

    The Attributes can be raised, or lowered, during career
    generation, but the base number rolled here is what is used for
    acquiring all subsequent skills.
    
3.  Advantages and disadvantages balance against each other, period.
    You can take either at any time, as long as the GM agrees and
    the points balance.

4.  Run a standard Trav-style career path for the character.  I\'m
    thinking 2 year terms, rather than 4.

    a.  So many background skill levels for the first 17 years of
        life (I think 6 levels with no skill receiving more than 2
        would be good, might be too high.)
    
    b.  Enlist/draft into a career -- first term
    
        1.  Choose/roll an Occupation within the career (branch, MOS
            or specialty)
       
        2.  Get core skills for this career and occupation (This
            will vary based on career and occupation, College and

Mechanically speaking you are generally correct. ;->  Task Systems just try to make uniform and easy to handle what ad-hoc modifier systems do. CT was based around ad-hoc modifer rules, of course, however DGP introduced the idea fairly early on and, Task Systems have been an integral part of Traveller ever since...for a lot of us anyway.   

Whether you prefer one or the other is obviously personal choice.

It\'s TD, I believe, but I\'m not going to pull out the box and dig through my old copies and check tonight. ;->

This is where I think Task Systems shine, they make stating tasks more uniform and completing them more intuitive. As a younger GM, way back when, I always had problems deciding whether a mod should be a 1 or a 2...or maybe a 3...and even worse, I wouldn\'t be as consistent as I should have been, I\'d forget I used a -1 DM last time and say it was -2 leading to occasional "discussions" with the players. ;->  OTOH, for *me* it was easy to judge that a Task is Routine or Difficult or Formiable and I found it easy to stay consistant, too.

I doubt it! ;->  

You know, it *really* isn\'t a problem to graft a Task System onto GURPS.  When 4th edition comes out I certainly hope that will be one of the "improvements" we find in it.

The model actually isn\'t too bad for IC engines. Some of the external
combustion stuff as written in FF&S2 is more than 100% efficient,
though...<G>

IC Engines get a little more efficient and a little more energy dense
with increasing TL.

TL Type          PowOut  Mass   FuelRate   Efficiency
4  Primitive IC   0.25    1      0.3        0.34
5  Internal Comb. 0.33    1      0.25       0.41
6  Adv. IC        0.5     2      0.2        0.52
7  IC Turbine     0.59    1      0.2        0.52
8  Adv. IC Turb.  0.77    1      0.2        0.66
 
PowOut - MW per m3, Mass tons/m3, Fuel rate m3/MW-hour. TL 7 and 8
engines run on HGHCD (=diesel), earlier engines on gasoline.

Efficiency - energy available for work as a fraction of fuel energy.

The big improvement where ground vehicles are concerned is in
transmission efficiency, and the FF&S model seems to fit well for this
too.

Changing fuels changes the required fuel tank size and some
characteristics of the engine (e.g. startup time, which is not discussed
in the design books -?in MT Player\'s Manual??). 

Diesel and gasoline actually have about the same energy content :-

Fuel      MJ/L
Gasoline  35
Diesel    36
Methanol  15.6
Ethanol   21.3

Fuel injection vs. a \'carbie\' should affect engine reliability, and
could be \'smoothed out\' of raw performance data.

Similarly, turbo and supercharging increase thermal -> mechanical
efficiency a little (max. 20%) with increased engine unreliability
(shorter maintenance intervals).

Suggest :-
TL     Maximum Supercharge/Turbo Bonus to plant efficiency
5      +5%
6      +10%
7      +15%
8+     +20%

with reliability penalties of +4/+3/+2/+1 (using a T4/4.1 type system as
per the \'Emperor\'s Vehicles\' book).

Engine price should be increased by 10% per % of supercharging.

So a TL 8 advanced IC turbine with an optimised \'turbo\' costs 200% of
base, has an efficiency of (0.66 X 1.2) or 0.8, so its fuel rate
decreases to 0.165m3/MW-hour when the turbo kicks in.

Off-road vs. on-road : apart from borrowed (rented?) cars, purpose built
off road vehicles have a lower ground pressure. Due to the limitations
of the extant models, the easiest way to simulate this is to build a
bigger vehicle to get bigger wheels (tyres).

But it kind of works out OK anyway ; you can build a Range Rover or Land
Cruiser with FF&S/VDS/GURPS Vehicles ; VDS requires the least
\'tweaking\', GURPS Vehicles will yield the fastest car!

Extremes of vehicle mass are not modelled well (except in Greg Porter\'s
Vehicle Design System).

I propose the following \'patch\' for FF&S :-

Maximum ground vehicle speed (road) (km/h) =
1000 X transmission efficiency X sqrt(thrust efficiency X motive
power/vehicle mass),

where motive power is in MW, vehicle mass in tonnes, and unstreamlined
hulls have a thrust efficiency of 1.

For extremes of vehicle mass, multiply by the following \'fudges\' :-
Mass (tonnes)   Fudge factor
 < 1             0.625
 >=10	         1.2
 >=20	         1.6
 >=40	         2.0
 >=80	         2.4

This works well for vehicles ranging from bicycles through Formula 1
cars to main battle tanks (halving the FF&S2 efficiencies for track
transmissions).

Constructive criticism is welcome, as always.

Ground Vehicles, v1.1

This design sequence should enable you to create anything from a
travois to a Tech Level 15 walker.
FF&S (1 or 2) rules are required - [for the moment].

* 1. Hull
i. Choose hull size from the Basic Hull Size table.

* Typical vehicle dimensions (metres)

Type                        Length   Width     Height
Motorcycle (no sidecar)     1.6-1.8   0.4      0.9-1
Small car (2 door hatch)    3.8-4     1.5      1.2-1.3
Medium sedan                4.2       1.6      1.3-1.4
Large sedan or estate wagon 4.5-4.6   1.7      1.4
4WD or minivan : as per large car with height to 1.9m (very high ground
clearance 4WD)
Light truck or minibus      5-7.5     to 1.8   1.4 to 2
Prime mover                 7-9       1.8-2.2  2 to 3
Bus or semitrailer          ~15       ~3       ~4 
Mark One tank (GB)          9.3       4        2.4
WW2 (and later) tanks       6-9       2.7-3    2.5 to 3

* UK Motor Vehicle Dimensions (maxima permissible for UK roads)
Type                                  Length, m
Wheeled                               12
Track laying (e.g. plant equipment)   9.2
Motor vehicle and trailer             18
Motor vehicle and trailer (goods)     18.35
Motor vehicle and two+ trailers       25.9

                                      Width, m
Motor vehicle                         2.55
Refrigerated                          2.6
Locomotive (prime movers + trains)*   2.75
Trailer (mass more than 3.5 tonnes)   2.55
Other trailer                         2.30
Agricultural trailer or appliance     2.55

[*on UK permanent way gauge 1432mm = 4ft 8.5" - same as U.S.]

ii. Choose configuration :
The basic configuration for most land vehicles is a box with
an aspect ratio of (4-5:2:1), or the slab.
Tanker trailers and cement mixers are 3.5 to 5:1 cylinders.
Motorcycles and bicycles can be regarded as close structures, unless
enclosed in shells, etc.

iii. Streamlining : motorcycles have a base streamlining of nil (thrust
efficiency 1) ; other vehicles have a base streamlining of simple. Some
high performance vehicles may require fast subsonic airframes
e.g. Formula 1, rocket cars and similar land-speed record threatening
devices.

iv. Armour : The minimum hull thickness for ground vehicles is 0.25cm.
Motorcycles and bicycles don\'t have \'outer skins\', generally.

Options for box configurations
a. Increased armour on particular faces.
There are two ways of doing this : calculate area of various face(s)
individually, or use the following fudge :-

Face	Increase in volume per cm additional thickness
Front or rear	+10%
Top or bottom	+20%
Sides (both)	+30%

b. Sloped armour : by angling the armour, the effective thickness is
increased.
This uses up a lot of volume in waste space though.

Effective increase in armour value = baseline/cos(slope angle measured
from vertical)
Effective increase in volume = (w X [h^3])/[2tan(slope angle)]

So:-
degree of slope 20  30  40  45  50  60  70  80
volume mult     1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.9 2.4 3.8
armour mult     1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.6 2   2.9 5.8

Volume mult - multiply base volume by this to determine actual volume.
Armour mult - multiply base armour rating to determine effective value. 

v. Structure : A minimum 1.5G structure is required. Faster vehicles
(e.g. sports and racing cars) may need further reinforcement, depending
on their acceleration
(see below).


* 2. Locomotion
i. How Much Motive Power Do I Need?
One conversion to remember : 746W = 1 horsepower.

Motorcycles :-
Displacement  Horsepower range     Kilowatts
250cc           30-45              22.4 - 33.6
500cc           45-65              33.6 - 48.5
750cc           65-75              48.5 - 56.0
1100cc          100-175            74.6 - 130.6

Cars :-
50-80 horsepower (30-60kW) per litre of engine displacement (ignoring
turbocharging)

Extreme examples :-
Lambourghini Countach : 447 horsepower (333.46 kW)
F1 cars : 500-600hp (! - 373 to 448 kW)

Heavy Vehicles :-
truck (prime mover) 250-500hp
Mark One tank (GB) : 105hp - 28 tonnes, top speed 8km/h
Chieftain MBT (UK) : 760hp
M1 Abrams : 1500hp

ii. Velocity and acceleration 
The maximum speed of a ground vehicle is dependent on its power to
weight ratio.

Base maximum speed = 1000 X (trans effy) X sqrt(thrust effy X motive
power/mass),

where motive power is in MW, and vehicle mass in tonnes.

There are further effects for extremes of vehicle mass. These do not
apply to vehicles with walker transmissions.

Mass	Multiple
< 1     0.625
>=10	1.2
>=20	1.6
>=40	2.0
>=80	2.4

* Acceleration (on the flat) :-

9 X [motive power/mass]^(0.33) ms-2

Acceleration is often expressed in auto magazines in terms of time to
100km/h, or 60mph.

iii. Transmission Types 

There are five basic transmission types.

Volume is in m3/MW
Area m2/MW
Price MCr/MW
All have a base mass of 1 tonne per m3.
Optimised transmissions can be constructed ; halving transmission mass
doubles the cost.
Minimum transmission mass is 1/4 base mass.

Friction
Sled and skate blades, skis. Best on low friction surfaces like ice and
snow. Performance in other environments is poor.

1	1.4	3	0.01	0.25
2	1.0	2	0.008	0.3
3+	0.8	1	0.006	0.4

Wheels
Wheel and axle, powered or unpowered. Carriages drawn by animals require
a transmission equal to the peak power output the animals can generate.
Wheeled vehicles have a fair off road capability.

TL	Vol	Area	Price	Efficiency

7	1.4	6	0.041   0.6
8+	1.0	5	0.025   0.7

Tracks
A belt of metal segments looped over a series of driving and guide
wheels. Steering is usually effected by locking one track and pivoting
(slewing) the vehicle.
Excellent off road capability ; the transmission of choice for heavy
vehicles like construction equipment and tanks.

TL	Vol	Area	Price	Efficiency

7	2.1	10	0.2     0.25
8+	1.5	9	0.12    0.275

Hover
The vehicle is held a few centimetres off the ground on a bubble of air.
Hovercraft have true all-terrain capability, but can be difficult to
steer, especially in windy conditions.
The power requirement becomes prohibitive in thin atmospheres ; values
below are for one atmosphere pressure.

7	2.5	15	0.013   0.4
8+	2.0	10	0.01    0.5

Walker
The vehicle moves on legs like an animal. Walking vehicles can move over
broken terrain which is not possible with any other vehicle type.
An electronic \'nervous net\' is required to effectively co-ordinate
the mechanical legs, hence the relatively high Tech Level requirement.

TL	Volume	Area	Price	Efficiency	Leg Volume
8	8	22	0.8	0.1	        0.2    
9	4	18	0.6	0.2	        0.2
10	2	15	0.4	0.25	        0.2
12	1	10	0.2	0.3	        0.15
14+	0.5	10	0.1	0.35	        0.1

Leg volume is total leg volume as percentage hull volume, per leg.
(first volume figure is transmission contained within hull).
Area equals hull area required and ground contact area, for simplicity.
Leg armour and structure should be determined as per the hull. There is
no free volume in the legs for other equipment - it\'s assumed that this
is taken up by control machinery, etc. 


3. Sensors, Commo, Navigation

<Consult relevant tables>

The following items are commonplace at the listed Tech Levels :-
TL   Feature
4    Headlights
6    radio receiver
7    2-way radio (oh, the funky days of CB...)
8    cellular phone
9    navigation computer, heads-up display (civilian ; TL 7-8 for
military)


4. Weapons

Turrets : enclosed rotating weapon mounts, usually placed on the top of
the vehicle.

A superstructure equal to the required size should be constructed.
Main turrets have a volume equal to 10% or more of the base chassis
volume. Only one can be mounted on the vehicle.

Small turrets have a volume less than 10% of base chassis volume.
If manned, the turret is a cupola (requires at least a cramped crew
position), otherwise it is a remote mount which requires a gunner.

Chassis mounted weapons are attached to some facing of the vehicle.
Pintle :- a post or rail to which a light weapon is attached e.g. a
machine gun.
Open :- a chassis mount on an open-topped vehicle.


5. Controls, Crew, Amenities

<refer to the relevant tables>

Amenities :-
Vehicle air conditioning can be regarded as \'minimal life support\' for
the passenger compartment.

Controls and their effects on Ease of Use :-
TL  Type                    Modifier
5   Automatic transmission  -1
6   Power steering          -1
7   Anti-lock brakes,       -1 each
    Cruise control
8   Traction control,       -1 each
    full control from
    steering wheel

Crew positions :-
Small vehicles don\'t require access space around seats.
Description   Volume/m3
Cramped       0.8
Adequate      1.0
Roomy         1.5
Luxurious     2.5

Most car manufacturers assign 1m3 volume per person for an average car.
Large vehicles are allocated 1.5m3 ; NASA allocates this as the volume
required for a vacc-suited individual to comfortably operate controls.


6. Power plants and fuel
Ideally, there is sufficient volume to fit
all the desired goodies into the hull and have power for them too!

Racing engines : like transmissions, these should be optimisable -
perhaps halving the mass at 10X the cost would be a good starting point
(ceramic engine blocks, etc?)

A. Endurance Class     Fuel supply at maximum power output
1. Civilian/Sports       2 hours
2. Endurance I           6 hours
3. Endurance II          8 hours
4. Endurance III         12 hours
5. Endurance IV          >12 hours

Most vehicles would fit into class 1.
Military vehicles (tanks and APCs) would make it to class 4
(most 2 and 3).
Class 5 vehicles are unlikely, for safety reasons (all that explosive
fuel, unless nuclear or battery powered).
 

7. Design Evaluation
a. Maximum velocity and acceleration : recalculate now that overall
vehicle mass is known.

b. Range = maximum speed X endurance

c. Ground clearance
Generally :-
Overall height = hull + superstructure height + ground clearance

*Wheels and tyres
i. Wagon wheels, trains : wheel area as shown.
Contact area is small :- wheel area/constant
Vehicle mass (tons) :-   constant
0.1-1			 50			
1-10			 30
11-100			 20
101+			 10

ii. Tyre + wheel area (sidewall) = 2.5 X area given (TL => 4)
This is for standard aspect tyres, 2 per axle.
Multiply area value by 2.5 for every additional 2 tyres per axle.
E.g. an 18-wheeler has a sidewall area of (2.5 X 2.5) = 6.25 X base area

\'Slicks\' (low aspect tyres) have an area multiple of 1.25.

Total contact area = (tyre + wheel area)/constant
values in square metres
                               Tyre Type
Vehicle mass (tons) :-    Standard    Slicks
0.1-1                       30         10
1-10                        20         6
11-100                      10         3
101+                         5         2

Can divide up amongst number of tyres.

Ground clearance (m) = k X sqrt(sidewall area / (number of tyres X pi))

suggested values k :-
0.1 - race car (F1/Indy)
0.3 - minimum for sports car, low-rider or similar street vehicle.
0.4 - minimum for unmodified road vehicle.
0.5 - minimum for 4WD or similar \'all terrain vehicle\'
k should be no higher than 1.5.
 
* Tracks :-
Track contact area = area calculated
Ground clearance (m) :- overall height / 20

*Walkers :-
Leg length = total leg volume / (total contact area X number legs)
Ground clearance = leg length (the transmission volume is contained
within the hull, then the legs start).
Maximum height jumped (m) = (2 X max power to legs / vehicle mass X g)
power in MW, mass in tons, g 10ms^(-2).
This ignores air resistance and assumes reasonable leg structure values.
(on the order of 40G+ - may have to consider rules for shock absorbers).

d. Ground pressure :-
The weight of a vehicle influences what terrain it can move over.

This effect is exploited by friction transmissions on ice - the pressure
exerted over the contact area of the blades causes the ice to liquefy,
dramatically improving traction.

Ground pressure (kPa) = Vehicle weight (kN) / contact area (m2).

Hovercraft have an effective ground pressure of zero.

GP, kPa  Off-Road Speed Multiplier	Terrain Restriction?
<=5	        1.0
<=50	        0.8	                None on land!
<=100	        0.6 - tanks (70-80)	can traverse sand, mud
<=200	        0.4 
<=400	        0.2 - car (201)
<=800	        0.1 - truck (650)	can traverse clay, packed earth
<=1600	        0.05	                only on sealed road
> 1600	        0.025	                only on specialised pavement		

Comments :-
Anti-personnel mines are usually set to trigger
with a threshold pressure of 21-84kPa.
Anti-tank mines are usually set to trigger with a
threshold pressure of 70-560kPa.

The actual ground pressure equation is rather complex :-

GP = [Kc/b + Kp]^(1/(2n+1)) X [ 3W / ((3-n)b(sqrt(D)))]^(2n/(2n+1))

GP in psi, per tyre (pounds force per square inch)
b tyre width, inches
W weight in lbf
Kp (actually phi) - frictional modulus of terrain deformation
Kc - cohesion modulus of terrain deformation
n - exponent of terrain deformation
D - tyre diameter, inches

Example values for constants :-
       Sand        Clay
n      1.1         0.73
Kp     3.9         24.5
Kc     0.1         16.3

So : higher n more deformable
     higher Kp - more traction possible
     higher Kc - material less likely to break up or non granular.

Mud intermediate n, slightly lower Kp and Kc compared to clay
Rock or road - low n, higher Kp and Kc compared to clay

the personality conflicts that seem to dominate the list of late!

Theoretically possible, but far less likley when it has less distance

Not really. See how the Hercules and Starlifter handle it.

That\'s not correct.

A tail sitter requires each piece of landing gear to handle more
stress,
because there\'s less of them due to the lack of surface area for
mounting them.

It does if you think about it.

It makes sense for the same reason that RORO freighters exist in the
real world, it\'s easier to
move cargo more or less horizontally in one plane.

Now you could argue that grav makes this unneccessary, but if you are
trying to move cargo between the two different types we\'re talking
about here, the move requires either at least two 90 degree direction
changes, or the moving of the parallel freighter vertically up each
deck of the tail-sitter, with loading hatches on each deck

Actually,  moving cargo between two tail-sitters is twice as difficult
as moving from a parallel to a tail-sitter, which should make it
obvious why tail-setters would be uncommon for cargo ships.

    'body' => 'I\'m utterly flabbergasted at the flak Cliff\'s getting for his question
about Gurps Traveller

He asked "what sucks about GT?"

That\'s a perfectly reasonable question, phrased in normal
conversational English.

It doesn\'t imply that  GT is necessarily bad, and it doesn\'t insult
any member of the list (unless sucking has some
non-politically-correct meaning insulting to a specially-abled
minority in this context that I am unaware of  )

He _didn\'t_ say  :
"Yo muthafuckers, which of you zoned-out crackheads is going to tell
me why GT should be inserted sideways up Clinton\'s ass?"

though some of you are reacting as if he did much worse.

I wouldn\'t find the latter example personally insulting either, or
grounds for the sort of comment Cliff is getting for his innocuous
question. Though I can see why grandma\'s sewing circle might be upset
by it, and I would agree that it\'s not particularly polite, it\'s
pretty common language most places.

His later responses about people being afraid to post negative comment
are, while somewhat paranoid, I feel justified by the reaction his
comment got. To an outsider it would seem that many people were trying
to stifle negative discussion about the subject.  To someone\'s who
been around the list for a while, well, it\'s just the sort of
prissiness and holier-than-thou attitude one has to expect on the TML

For me, anyway, the positive benefits of subscribing outweigh having
to put up with such attitudes from some of the members.

Oh, and BTW, to the person who threatened to leave the list :
"Like, we care ?"

That threat was another example of the sort of old boy snobbishness
involved, implying that if a regular member of the list got _so_ upset
the he felt like leaving, we simply _must_ deal with this reprobate,
post haste,  eh what, old bean ?

Basically, the people complaining about Cliff need to grow up, get a
life, and realize they\'re not in kindergarten anymore, and that the
TML is a forum for people to discuss things related to Traveller, not
a discussion group for Mrs Beatson\'s Guide to Etiquette,  Mannerly
Living, and the One Hundred and One Things a True Lady Should Not  Be
Seen Doing In Public

<obTrav  : Now _there\'s_ a 101 book for DGP.....>

And before you reply to Cliff again about how you think he should
phrase his posts, (or before you respond to this post, for that
matter) just think about the supposed principles of free speech in the
country many of you hail from, the Vulcan IDIC principle, and then ask
yourself who died and made you god ?

Uh uh, <wags finger> don\'t hit that reply button,   I said _think_
about it, not regale me with your opinions about it.

BTW, I\'m fully aware of the irony of preaching against preaching, so
don\'t bother commenting on that one either.

One method of determining hit location which does not slow combat down
at all is reversing the number rolled on the percentile dice to hit.  If
you roll a 37 to hit your opponent then you have hit them in location
73.  You then look at the little picture on the charecter sheet  and see
that this is a hit to the body.  This method is used in the Warhammer
Fantasy Role Playing Game and it works quite well there. [Warhammer FRP
is a game that, like Traveller, has a better setting than system.] The
system has only 6 head locations head, body, l arm, r arm, l leg, r
leg.  Hit location does not make much of a difference for most wounds
but for critical hits (wounds that dammage you beyond your hit capacity)
location can make a big difference.  A minor critical to the arm might
make you drop your weapon where a minor critical to the head might leave
you too stunned to fight for a few rounds.

The concensus is that doing 9 g with a 6 g compensator exposes you to 3g.

How many gs you can take depends on which *direction* they are in. For
example, anyone in decent health should be able to handle 3g flat on
their back for a fair amount of time. Folks in good condition should
be able to handle it for *hours*. This is because the altitude
difference in your body is a matter of a few inches. Not much "uphill"
pumping for your heart.

And "flat on your back" *is* the way most accel will be in space
fighters, and even in larger ships (assuming they have intelligently
designed accel couches). 

Aircraft get the "positive gees" (ie head to foot) and occasional
"negative gees" (foot to head). These cause major problems due to blood
pooling in the legs and abdomen (g-suits squeeze this out) or pooling
in the head (bad news, strokes can occur!).

Limits for head to foot accel are 2-3g for a few seconds (some of the
more extreme carnival rides) for "average" people. For folks in *good*
condition, I\'d say maybe as much as 10-15 minutes at 3 g down to
seconds at 9 g (a *hard* pullout in an aircraft). 

Side to side accel is somewhere in between.

Nobody has located any *hard* info from NASA or the Air Force, but the
above is derived from things mentioned in passing.

Oh yeah, the record is over 80 gees for a few seconds in the "on your
back" config.

For laser pistols, just open it up, and smear some vaseline or the like
on an *inside* surface of the optics. It won\'t show unless the weapon
is disassembled. But the optics will do a good grenade imitation when
it\'s fired. A trip-wire hooked to the trigger makes it into a booby
trap, otherwise, rig a delay circuit.

If the "vaseline" intercepts as little as 1% of the beam energy,
that\'ll be more than enough bang. :-)

In that case Norris would have been on his way to Capital when the assasination

Assuming that it\'s overheated: either you wait for it to cool down or
you\'re going to need some coolant.

Possibly a can of "InstaCool" is in the service kit,
or you use some water from your canteen,
or you substitute another liquid that\'s available and you can afford to
spare.

Clif,
	Well, I don\'t think that I am the best choice for that position. 
Especially with trying to get the ISP business going and all, I will
have very little time to devote to managing a project such as this. 
Normally I would be honoured, but I don\'t think it would be fair for the
others if I were to do it and then let it drop as such a silly thing as
money get in the way... :-)  I think I would rather remain as just an
enthusiast at this point.

Any volunteers?

  {
    'body' => 'Here are a few suggestions about how an energy weapon might be 
"jammed."  Please keep in mind that these are based on only a few 
minutes of creative juices flowing after catching up with my TML 
reading this morning.  If any of these make sense, great!  If not, 
I\'d like to blame the fact that I\'m not fully awake yet.  (I can\'t, 
of course, but I\'d like to.  :)

All of these excuses should require about the same amount of time to 
recover as a "jammed" firearm.

Eight Different Reasons Why An Energy Weapon Might Be Considered 
Jammed:

1.)  Rapid or vigourous movement causes short/disconnection to power
pack/power supply.  Connection must be re-established before the 
weapon can become active.

2.)  Magnetic firing control becomes hyper-polarized and is frozen
in open position, and must be replaced or "degaussed" before the
weapon can be used again. 

3.)  Through faulty manufacture or usage, a portion of the firing
optics becomes fused and opague, rendering the weapon ineffective
until replaced.  (Lasers)

4.)  Faulty power source/power meter falsely indicated a full power 
source, but source is now empty/depleted.  Must replace power source.

5.)  Trigger mechanism breaks and is not responsive to activation.  
Mechanism will need to be replaced or repaired.  (Could be as simple 
as a small spring or lever that\'s slipped from position, but weapon 
must be dismantled to fix it.)

6.)  Cooling system/power source overheating, rendering the weapon 
inoperable until repaired or brought to a lower temperature.

7.)  Rupture in housing renders weapon ineffective for focusing 
laser/containing fusion or plasma reaction, and continued operation 
of the weapon becomes hazardous to the user.

8.)  Rupture in housing exposes internal mechanisms to exotic or 
corrosive atmosphere/atmospheric taints, which causes the weapon to 
seize up/become inactive until repaired or replaced.  (Non-standard 
atmospheres.)

I\'m sure there are other suggestions, but this is all I could come up 
with in ten minutes.  Referees are encouraged to be creative in the 
descriptions of any of these events when presenting them.  With 
enough pseudo-science techno-babble, it brings home the flavor of a 
good s/f game to the players.  And that means more enjoyment for the 
entire group.  (As well as a healthy respect for the fallibilities of 
even advanced technology.  Nothing\'s perfect.  :)

Hope this helps.

Yup. Mine took from about November or December. Looks like they have things

Nothing.

Does that mean that GT has no problems?  No.  I dislike Imperial
measurements.  That does no "suck" however.  It\'s a minor annoyment.  The
system questions are fairly irrelevent to me, since I use CORPS.

For a good example of a Traveller product that does "suck", try Emperor\'s

Carlos Hathcock wasn\'t just the most successful sniper in American military

>I tend to agree with you.  What does ACQ have?

ACQ uses an Action Point system.  You can spend AP to raise the target
number of the T0-Hit task.  If you roll 5 below the To-Hit task, any damage
that gets through armor is doubled.  If you roll 9 below, you do triple
damage.

Example:  Shooting a pistol at Short range, your To-Hit number is 11 or
less on 3D.  You spend 4 AP to raise the target number to 15.  If you
rolled 9, you\'d do 2D damage.. assume no armor.

The damage rolls are a 3 and 5.  Since you made the To-Hit by more than 5,
those are doubled (to 6 and 10) before applying them to the characteristics.

You can also declare an attempt to hit a particular body part (such as a
gunman\'s had), use the target size rules to figure the difficulty adjustment.

Charles,

From my personal experience with MT, some players
and GMs find the text description easier to 
visualize than a string of DMs. In some cases, it
helped standardize the DMs rather than leaving them
up to a GM\'s whim, thereby providing everyone with
a reasonable expectation and avoiding some of the
arguments which arise when players perceive the
GM as being capricious (word for day :-) ).

Ah, but I can say to my players after a session or two: \'It looks easy to
do that\' or \'That\'s staggeringly hard\' and they automatically reach for the
right dice and the narrative flow is maintained. You don\'t get the roll nD
+DM jolt of reality with it. YMMV - It could just be a matter of style.

Hmm. It\'s got the standard Russian tank problems (duff autoloaders,
terrible crew ergonomics). It\'s also got armour that will deflect a
120mm APFSDS-DU round (Kontact-5); and an anti-missile system to die
for.

So where do you see the US going for the Bradley replacement? More IFV
or back to basics?

MPAT looked to me (on the noddy diagram I saw) like a smart-fused HEAT.
As you say, if you\'re trying to plink helos with a tank cannon then
something is already badly wrong.

Assuming that the next war will be similar to Desert Storm? Dangerous.
Vilani thinking, even.

Tanks versus the enemy recce element isn\'t fair. Good news for your

Pretty much - Marines take and hold a dropzone, then the Army rolls in -
as opposed to the WWII use of Marines to take and clear entire islands.

I guess there are 97 vietnamese families, probably full of wonderful 
persons, who really don\'t care about don\'t seeing the likes of 
that man again. Sorry, but please realize that somebody could find 
this Off Topic american comment offensive. I do not want to start a 
flame war here, and I apologize if my comment in time offends 
somebody, but people who kill people in RL are touchy subjects which 
are better off-list. I read enough about killers in the newspapers. 
Let\'s go back to Traveller, please.

Carlos (not Hathcock), who personally finds more interesting the life 
of Carlos, the Jackal, but will not post here about him when he dies.

You\'ll be wanting my World Builder Deluxe software. It generates extended
details from a UWP based on the rules contained in the World Builder\'s
Handbook. It also generates Encounter Tables, Psionic Instititutes details
and Economic details. The program will automatically create Extended World
Details for an entire Sector using standard SEC files.

I am currently working on the next version which will expand the generation
System wide. It will also generate the military capablities of the World.

The program can be downloaded from my website listed below.

I would certainly be interested in being involved in the Websector project.
I have been working with a few other TML members, Derrick Jones, Tom Bont
with the goal of creating a standardised extended file format for world,
system, subsectors and sectors. Perhaps we should set up a working group to
discuss it further?

	I think the point is to get a feeling of the differences in 
difficulties, discretizing the 2+, 3+, 4+, .... 15+ range into 
something more manageable.

> In MT (IIRC) each diff level had a target 3 higher than the one below it.

	4 higher. 3, 7, 11, 15

> Isn\'t this the same as saying "a -3 DM makes things hard, a +3 easy"?

	Yes, but it works both ways. You can get rid of the diff levels, or 
of the DMs. I switched to a system "3-Task System" where levels are 
3 higher (6, 9, 12, 15, 18). Then, it makes few sense to have more 
than a +1 or -1 DM. But, rather than getting into the DMs without 
diff levels as you seem to suggest, I concentrate on the 
diff levels. A better set of tools makes the Difficult task Average. 
Bad observation conditions make the Difficult task Formidable. And so 
on. Instead of thinking in DMs and increase/decrease diff levels, you 
think mainly ony in changing diff levels, with occasional DMs for 
"refined" effects. Of course it IS the same tha having +3/-3 DMs, but 
you discretize things at a simpler level and play is quicker and 
ref\'s work easier. IMHO, of course. I rarely use DMs, normally change 
diff levels.

> I guess it just seems like an extra step to me.  Why tell a player "It\'s a

That\'s a good point. But after a while, you get used to translating 
the diff levels into numbers, and there are fewer (3+, 6+, 9+, 12+, 
15+) and it is easier to get a feeling. There is a "cognitive 
dissonance" in discretizing directly to the numbers and ignoring the 
intermediate values.

	Yes, but having a more limited number of targets makes the ref\'s 
life easier (and that of players, too). I can\'t really get a feeling 
for the difference between 7+ and 8+, but there is a big enough jump 
between 6+ and 9+ to name them "Easy" and "Average" and keep them as 
two consecutive levels. Human mind is limited, specially when you 
want quick&dirty rules.

	Yep! Exactly the way my 3-Task System works. Want to share 
experiences? ;-)

Actually, the MT task system set a series of target numbers that were 
spaced 4 apart.  The skills listed were applied directly as modifiers 
to the 2D6 roll.  Thus, under MT (and CT, too, if you use the DGP 
Task System), Difficulty determines the target roll needed to 
accomplish the task.

The difficulty determining target remained the same in TNE, but was 
changed to number of dice in T4, I think.  (I don\'t play T4, so I can 
only guess from books I\'ve flipped through.)

In other words, the game mechanic shifted from one specific die roll
with mods vs a variable target (CT/MT), to variable die rolls vs a 
(specific or variable, not sure) target (T4/T5).

Either way, the difficulty levels provide a systematic means of 
documenting and referencing die rolls within the specific system, and 
establishes a common mechanic that can be used to predictably 
evaluate a character\'s performance when attempting certain tasks.

Before the task system concept evolved, CT had seemingly arbitrary 
selections of die rolls and modifiers that changed from skill to 
skill and situation to situation.  While some gamers like that level 
of freedom, others prefer a more structured approach.  It\'s all a 
matter of taste, though.

I hope this helps clear up the concept a touch.  Good luck, and Happy 
Travellin\'.

It takes far less intelligence than your average igneous rock to talk like
this.

The problem was not the question "what sucks about GURPS Traveller". The
problem was and is the abusive responses to people who expressed their
opinion that NOTHING \'sucks\' about it. Some of us chose to say that despite
what others perceive as problems, we don\'t think it sucks. Rather than
calmly replying, or better yet rephrasing his original question in a less
inflammatory manner, Clif chose to do what you have done; acted like an
idiot. That ticked me off.


>Oh, and BTW, to the person who threatened to leave the list :

Since you like this kind of talk, I don\'t give a rat\'s ass whether you care
or not. I have the right to protest what I feel is INAPPROPRIATE and
ANNOYING behavior from a bunch of trolls who don\'t have two brain cells to
rub together and are just trying to cause trouble.

The Vulcan "IDIC" principle was a marketing gimmick made up by Gene
Roddenberry to sell some pendants he wanted to market through Lincoln
Enterprises. If you really think Roddenberry believed that crap, go back and
look at how he treated women in both the original series and TNG. And Most
of us don\'t build our lives around a philosophy created for a TV show..those
of us with brains anyway. (I do like Star Trek, but this irritates me)

I suggest you get something done about this severe case of rectal-cranial
inversion before you pop off about something else.

Because a lot of people find the words are easier to understand than the
modifiers.

In many of my games I rolled all the dice myself, especially with
beginning players. I described the task ("That looks hard, easier if you\'e
dexterous and a trained medic"), they decided if they\'d try it, then I
rolled dice. The concentrated on role-playing.

A lot of people get confused/bothered by numbers, even if it is the same
thing. Just look at the endless half-die debates!

Just because we\'re not in Kindergarten is no excuse to act like you are. 
Seriously, if you expect to be heard reasonably, you have speak and act
reasonably.  In public, we could simply leave, but thats not quite so
simple here.  Frankly, if we spent a little more time in this country
worrying about what WAS mannerly, we\'d be better off, rather than being
worried about our supposed rights to free speech.

Vulcan IDIC.  Get real.  We live in a country where, fortuantely, we have
a great latitude of action.  However, some of us forget that such
latitude is no excuse to do whatever we want, wherever we want, whenever
we want, and to hades with the rest of those around.  
You and Clif are the ones who need to get a life, and stop scampering
about acting like foul mouthed pre schoolers.

In my part of the globe, that\'s considered rude. (OK, teenagers don\'t
consider it rude.)  

I\'ve been cautioned by my administration about using this kind of
language. (What I _wanted_ to say was a lot more pungent, given that I was
being assigned work that should have been done by someone who was paid
millions yet hadn\'t delivered. IIRC, I\'d been given enough duties to bring
me up to a 70-hour week, and I\'d muttered "that sucks" to myself in a
private meeting.)

ObTrav? Consider that normal phrases in one part of the Imperium might be
insults in another. A wise Traveller will adapt himself to his
surroundings, and consciously avoid giving offense. Rather than claiming
loudly that "\'gutwap\' is acceptable where _I_ come from" he will find a
less loaded term.

For example, suppose there\'s a planet where the word "roger" means
intercourse, in a rather crude manner (ie. "f**k"). Now imagine your
average military type on a mission, getting in trouble for obscenity when
he says "roger that" to his patron.

For added fun, pick a common word and force the players to talk in
character!

What, are you some kind of idiot? This isn\'t a newsgroup. There are rules,
written or not, on this list and you\'re breaking them with your
hypothetical profanity.

As for your apology, Allen, none is required. Pitt here should be the one
apologizing, but based on the tone of his post, I seriously doubt he has
the humility to know when he\'s done wrong.

I am reminded of a quote, from Disney World\'s Magic Kingdom, of all 
places:

"In Nature, there are no such things as rewards or punishments, only
consequences."

To make this ObTrav, I suppose I should add that this is the
philosophy of the universe, at least as portrayed by science
fiction. The vacuum of interstellar space is cold, unforgiving, and
uncaring. An ill-maintained ship is eventually going to misjump;
that\'s not a reward or punishment, but a consequence for a chosen
action.

Then again, so many things are...

Trapped in a random thought,

I witnessed a little debate when I was in Knox.  Our platoon sgts (who had
been in the Gulf in 60A3s) had said something similar but some of the other
experienced ones had said they felt differently.  My class was going through
when the Armor Conference was there (kinda like a fair... all kinds of
sparkling clean AFVs hanging around...).  So they took practically the whole
company and a General Dynamics Land Systems guy was there and he gave a hip
pocket class.  I can\'t remember the point by point of it, but even the "old
guard" platoon sgt\'s were convinced.  I think it had something to do the
phosphorous smoke and our current tactics with it, as well as the fires caused
by the wells the Iraqis lit, but really don\'t remember the particulars.  The
new systems have been "cheapened" a bit to make them more economic, too.

Not PC right now. : )  Besides, giving the current financial considerations
they\'re even talking of removing large groups of personnel from HEAT/MPAT and
"tank like targets" from sabot rounds.  Use machine guns for personnel is what
we\'re being told now.  Not a problem w/ the main gun.  Just lacks the round
and many argue we don\'t need it.

Oh, i\'m completely good natured about it.  Don\'t take it personal.  When I
call the soldiers that I personally know \'buttcrack,\' it\'s meant
affectionately.  ; )  *One* (of the 3) Army drill sgts attached to our
training unit at Knox has to be one of the hardest mothers I\'ve ever run into,
including my own DIs.  He said he wanted to lat transfer to the USMC, but they
were going to make him go to Marine boot camp (where he would have a real fun
time, no doubt), take rank from him, and were going to make him an admin POG,
so he obviously didn\'t do it.  He was always punching and hitting us
(especially in the gut).  And he would thrash the hell out of us when someone
errantly stepped on an EGA that were numerous on the deck of our barracks, far
worse than any of the Marine NCOs (and they weren\'t fun, by any means).

When was this?  I\'ve looked into a few commissioning programs in various
branches and becoming a USMC officer is, by far, the hardest, mentally and
physically.  College requirements et al.  In fact, I thought for awhile bout
going through an army or navy commissioning program cause they\'re alot easier
(though i decided I have far too much pride and respect for my core values to
actually do that).  Basically all my enlisted training is useless.  
For the Marines, I\'d still have to do 10-12 weeks of OCS (depending on the
program), 6 months at The Basic School, and then MOS all over again.  For the
army program, for example, I\'m not required to do the basic (because of MCRD)
and just have to do a 2 week "muster" kind of thing and then go to MOS (AIT,
whatever) and that\'s basically it.  The Navy was about the same IIRC.  All of
these after the college degree, of course.

When I saw all that, I gained a whole lot more respect for my officers, which
has always been high.  Can\'t recall any officer I\'ve ever been under who\'s
been less than outstanding.  I remember seeing army officers who wouldn\'t
stand a chance and navy officers who were fat and nasty as hell.  I\'d have a
real hard time respecting them.  My training should not have been harder than
those who are leading me.  YMMV.

Yes.  We just call it \'MOS school,\' to my knowledge.  Only time I\'ve had any
opportunity to "mingle" with army.

I know.   I was being silly.

Colonial forces are said to be hand-me-downs.  Core sector does indeed have
subsector fleets.  Capital itself has 4 extra as an "Imperial reaction force,"
which makes sense.  As far as having 16 regular and 16 reserve...  Piracy must
*really* be non-existant there!  And then some!  Or the fleets could be some
kind of reserves.  Keep headquarters for each up and running, etc w/ various
smaller units (couple squadrons at a time per fleet) going through "training
cycles", anti piracy sweeps (in response to ebb and flow of interstellar crime
or something), etc and they get called up when there\'s a war or something...
having the core sectors have full military forces would seem to be kind of
silly and unnecessary...  kinda analogous to the US putting a full fleet
(maybe just a single carrier battle group) on the great lakes and not going
anywhere except when there\'s an actual war.
