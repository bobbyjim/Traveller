 ...

 The "Fl" in the Spinward Marches listing stands for Florian
League, a rather opportunistic state sitting between the Imperium and
the Zhodani Consulate.  In my local campaign, nobody much likes them,
but most everyone tolerates them to some extent.  I don\'t expect the
League to survive to the New Era (but I could be wrong; it\'s happened
before :)
 The subsectors of the Spinward Marches are named in the MT Player\'s
Manual, on the inside front cover.  In case your edition doesn\'t
have this (I notice you\'re coming from Italy), they are as follows:

 First row (across top): Chronor, Jewell, Regina, Aramis
 Second row: Querion, Vilis, Lanth, Rhylanor
 Third row: Darrian, Sword Worlds, Lunion, Mora
 Bottom row: Five Sisters, District 268, Glisten, Trin\'s Veil

 I have not perused the Classic and MT world stats so thoroughly that
I can catalog the changes.  Most are Tech level changes, a few will
be population changes, and the entry for 2632 is a duplicate of 2602
(Corfu).  2632 doesn\'t exist.

  As one of those who responded privately put it, this list has trouble
seeing the difference between the rules and the background of TNE. It
makes perfect sense to me that Challenge no longer takes articles
written for the MT _system_.  It\'s no longer the current edition of the
game, and there are significant changes between editions.  Supporting
those _rules_ is pointless.
  On the other hand, the timeline of the Imperial universe has merely
been _advanced_, not rewritten (though some would argue this point).
If Challenge has a spot for pre-Rebellion or pre-Collapse material,
I wish you only good luck in getting your material published.

 As an aside, last week someone complained about the Traveller
material in Challenge 71, and how they could not tell the difference
between the editions of the articles except by careful reading.  Please
look at the inside bottom corner of each page.  "Space Race" IS labeled
as a MegaTraveller article.

  The rule from Classic Traveller was that your Computer Model Number
had to equal or exceed the rated Jump range of the ship, or it was
incapable of calculating the jumps.  "Bis" type computers counted
as one model# higher for this purpose (Thus the jump-2 Type S mounted
a 1/bis).  This rule was entirely absent from MegaTraveller, replaced
by the CP multiple.  The model number ceased to mean much at that
point, but was kept for sentimental reasons that you can thank DGP for.
Model number was removed entirely for TNE, and installation is now
based entirely on tech level and the number installed.

 Thank you for the rundown, the clarification of my "No Loitering"
label, and the information about the pocket archives.  I stand
corrected.
 All of the enthusiasm, whatever system it\'s for, that the folks on
the Pocket list brought to the TML is now absent from the TML.  That
is my primary complaint.


 Continuing, Keeper Of The Lint <darkstar@chopin.udel.edu> says a
variety of things I agree with, so I won\'t quote him extensively.
 Those of you upset with the change from "bell curve" to "linear"
can certainly change to 2d10, which is just as much a bell curve
as 2d6 is, and allows you to use the rest of TNE pretty much
changeless.
 "TL15 Han Solos"?  Yes, I\'ve got one.  Well, he\'s from Lunion (TL13),
and he\'s not much of a pilot (MT level 1), and he sleeps a lot (CON 3),
and...


 Scott Kellogg (or is it someone named Britta?) asks a gravitics
technology question I\'ve already answered to my satisfaction:  short-
duration gravity focusing is one of the elements accounting for the
_rather_ high efficiency of the HEPlaR drive.  It\'s just not documented
that way...


 And finally, PPUGLIESE@pimacc.pima.edu reiterates his opinion of TNE
in an unanswerable and inarguable fashion. I will not try to change his
mind, but neither will he prevent me from discussing TNE on this, the
CT/MT/TNE/2300AD Traveller Mailing List.  To each his way and mind.

never played or ran the latter. I really feel that TNE is a better system than
either of the others; it has a better character creation system that gives the
characters more skills and increased options. It has a smoother task resolution
system than MT (from appearances, at least). It has a more adaptible system
than MT, and the vehicle design sequences are much easier to understand. The
fact that it\'s incompatible with CT or MT doesn\'t really bother me; I use the
TNE rules for all my Traveller adventuring in whatever era.
   That being said, I do think GDW is making a mistake in not supporting the
fans of the older games by providing-early on-sourcebooks to allow TNE to be
used for campaigns in the Third Imperium or the Rebellion period. Also, a lot
of the new folks might not have access to the wealth of historical data from
the original game, and could use the sourcebooks to increase their knowledge
of the rich history of the Traveller universe. In my own Star Vikings
campaign, the characters are exploring the Khulam subsector. In the process,
they have come accross many situations based on earlier events in the Traveller
timeline. It lends a neat sense of history in the campaign; there are now TWO
lost cultures to rediscover; the Ancients and the Imperium.
   On the subject of the Star Vikings background: I treat them more as an elite
force than as regular military; rank isn\'t as important as respect. They think
of themselves more as explorers and, in a sense, protectors than as soldiers.
The Star Viking background is more action-oriented, and I like that. (I thought
THE ONCE AND FUTURE EMPEROR was an excellent adventure!) I always had trouble
coming up with things to do in a merchant-oriented campaign, and merc stuff is
not my style.
   Someone said something about not liking the Regency because it\'s "closed".
It\'s been made pretty clear that it isn\'t staying that way. For one thing, GDW
said in a recent Challenge that it is working on a book which will tell what
happens when the Regency and the Reformation Coalition meet; I\'m assuming this
meeting will take place somewhere between them, in the Wilds. I am currently
working on an idea for an adventure in the Regency where a group of characters
are sent on a secret scouting mission (in a manner similar to ARRIVAL VENGEANCE
by "stealing" a ship) beyond the blockade, to determine if Virus is still a
threat, and also to try to recontact certain worlds. It also was made clear in
the material in the game that the Regency economy cannot survive if the borders
are not opened; economic reality dictates an end to the Blockade. It will have
to happen; the question is when?
  I certainly have no qualms with anyone who enjoys Classic Traveller (I still
run it on occasion myself), but I myself prefer TNE.

Playing devil\'s (or at least, GDW\'s) advocate here, the answer as I see it
is that yes, you can.  Allow the "Thruster Plates" alternative maneuver
drive technology in your game, and there you have it.

Actually, there are a couple of "holes" that science-knowledgable players
and referees can poke in the "gravitic laser focussing" pseudo-explanation.
One is the above, that such sophisticated and powerful gravity manipulation
should enable a "reactionless" thruster technology.  Another is that any
gravity well that could focus laser light on a target that far away could
also focus small sensor arrays with very high resolution on such targets,
obviating the need for large-diameter sensor arrays, just as the magic
gravitic focussing obviates the need for large-diameter laser mirrors.

There is only one real answer to this dilemma.  The "magic" laser focussing
was introduced for a specific game purpose: to increase the range of space
combat to the point where the distance and time scales involved made
spacecraft maneuver fuel an important combat consideration.  This makes
Brilliant Lances space combat *much* more "interesting", and is the only
reason for including the technology.

If your players (or your scientific training ;) give you too much trouble
with the gravitic focussing, you can try the following handwaving to try and
clear up the trouble:

Any forces exerted by the gravity field on objects in the field, have a
reaction force, exerted by the field generator on it\'s mountings.
Therefore, a spaceship can\'t accellerate itself using the gravity field,
because any net force exerted on the ship by the field will be countered by
an identical and opposite net force exerted on the ship by the generator.

The gravitic focussing can\'t be used to improve sensor minimum array sizes,
because the amount a photon is bent depends on it\'s frequency.  So a field
which focusses one wavelength of EMS radiation on the detector array would
scatter all the others, making broad-spectrum analysis (which makes the EMS
sensor what it is) impossible.  Gravitic focussing works on lasers because
they are monochromatic (all one freqneucy) and therefore won\'t be diffracted
by the gravity field.  While I realize that this isn\'t much of an
explanation (after all, different frequency bands could use different
focussers and detectors), it might be enough to argue that this approach
isn\'t practical for sensors.

Finally (and if all else fails) you can disallow the gravitic focussing in
your campaign universe.  This will certainly remove the objection.  The
"magic" gravitic focussing is a "physics nullifier" anyway - it\'s just more
subtle about it than say, Dean Drive is (I suspect that just about any
"physics nullifier" can have dire consequences for all of physics, if used
in tricky, devious ways - some are just more subtle than others).  On the
other hand, if you go this route, then be prepared to have to rethink many
of the things that "published" sources take for granted.  Things like ranges
in space combat, for example, will be vastly different (either that, or
starships will look very odd).

I\'m in the final stages of organizing a Traveller: The New Era campaign, and
have a few slots for players.  No prior experience with Traveller or
Traveller: The New Era is required, and newcomers and experienced Traveller
players alike are welcome to join.

If you\'re familliar with the official "Imperial Space" universe, the setting
will be familliar.  The campaign will be set circa 1200 (as reconed by the
old Third Imperium calendar) in a small "pocket empire" called the Gralyn
Union.  All characters will be members of, or specialists attached to, the
Gralyn Union Exploratory Scout Service.  During the course of the campaign,
the players will be assigned to the starship FIDELITY for exploration and
re-contact missions.

Current plans are for two game sessions per month, on weekend evenings, and
will be held at my house (exact dates and times can be adjusted for the
mutual convenience of everyone involved).  I\'m located in the Aspen Hill
area, which is near Rockville, MD, and in the Washington DC metro area.

However, there is no info at all on them in the IE.
Anyway, it happens in the "remarks", and not in the allegiance column.
There are Fl worls marked as Non Aligned, Client State of the Imperium
or even Aslan New Lords. BTW, I don\'t recall any mention of the new
lords either in the Imperial Encyclopedia or in the Aslan Alien
Module. Is it something post-rebellion (in which case I\'ll dutifully
ignore it)?

Anyway, I only have the Encyclopedia, and not the Player\'s or
Referee\'s manual; I use Classic rules.
I am collecting all Classic traveller material I find, but I can\'t

I see, thanks for the errata. Any changes in allegiances? All my
information about District 268 comes from the Tarsus box, which
doesn\'t say much about allegiances; were they changed?

Part of it I\'m willing to chalk up to T:TNE being a (relatively) new
product.  For people with established campaigns, I doubt that very many are
switching rules systems, at least until the current campaign is over.  And
while sales of T:TNE have been good, I wonder how many T:TNE campaigns are
starting up.

This would be interesting enough that I\'m willing to put some effort into
making a tally.  Everybody out there who\'s currently running or involved in
a campaign, send me a quick e-mail message and tell me what kind of campaign
you\'re running in, and which rules system you\'re using.  Just a quick note,
some thing like "I\'m playing in a Classic Traveller campaign in the official
GDW universe".  Send it to me at wildstar@quark.qrc.com, and I\'ll tally the
results (# of Classic/Mega/NewEra in GDW/Other universes) and post back
here.  I\'m interested to know how many of you are playing what.

The limited distribution of the FF&S preview/playtest material was at GDW\'s
request.  I created a mailing list to facilitate communication between the
various people who recieved the FF&S "preview", and to try and cut down on
the number of redundant comments we generated and sent to GDW.

If ANY Traveller author wants us to review your material and send you some
relevant and constructive commentary, contact me and we will do our best to
help you.  The administrative address is gdw-beta-request@quark.qrc.com.

Membership in GDW-Beta is deliberately kept small, for two reasons.  One is
that it\'s a working group: lurkers don\'t contribute to the group\'s function,
which is to provide pre-publication feedback to Traveller writers.  The
second is that the group\'s mail is handled by a machine where I work, and
that will only be allowed for as long as the total traffic on the group
doesn\'t interfere with quark.qrc.com\'s business uses.

Although the original preview/playtest materials themselves are not
available to the general public (again, at GDW\'s request), the discussions
and commentary *are* archived, and available from the TML archive site.  FTP
to sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca, and look in the pub/Traveller/GDW-Beta directory.
I try to compile the archives monthly, and the December update should be
uploaded to sunbane before the end of the weekend (although it may take a
few days after that for Dan to make them available).

Now that FF&S is out, and we are unlikeley to have more than the occasional
Challenge (or maybe TTC) article to review, the group (like all
institutions) has developed a secondary function.  We are trying to put
together a "Designers\' Companion" for FF&S, consisting of "house rules" and
additional options, and lots and lots of examples.  Expect to see some
interesting and useful stuff from us over the next month or so.

These certainly aren\'t the only projects possible, nor there much "off-topic"
discussion on either list.  One main reason for making sublists is that
IMHO, most of the readers of TML aren\'t really interested in the details of
Aslan-Solomani-Imperial peace treaties as regards to colonization in
Reavers\' Deep in the late 900\'s (an actual example of a recent subject
thread on TNE-Pocket).  If you are interested, or want to pick up ideas
for your own campaign, you can follow the action blow-by-blow in the
archives of the appropriate group, which are available for public access.

Well, I wanted to tell you what was going on, and why the separation was
done.  I also agree with you on one point: TML has been pretty quiet lately,
and could use some enlivening!

So, before I go, I\'ll kick out a couple of questions intended to start some
discussion:

Has anyone besides me noticed what wonderful enemies the Star Vikings make?
It seems like the background and history was tailored to make the RCES
nearly perfect bad guys in all sorts of scenarios.  They\'re even better at
it than the Solomani were!

What about hivers?  Do you think that they deliberately cause the Rebellion,
or did they do it by accident as they were trying to Manipulate the
Imperium?  They sure didn\'t expect the Virus, or did they?  They certainly
seemed to recover from it quickly ---- almost like they knew what to expect!

What do you think happened to Terra?  My personal feeling is that another
Old Earth Union is too much to expect; given the wars of the Rebellion and
then the Virus, my personal choice is that Terra is probably recovering from
a severe Nuclear Winter right about now.

     The Fl stands for Fluid oceans. The idea here is that Methane or Ammonia
or some other nasty stuff has precipitated out of the atmostphere and formed
oceans that consist of something other than water. Check it out in the MT
Ref\'s guide. Don\'t know exactly where. Hope that helps.

     In response to Bruce E Johnson <bej@gas.uug.arizona.edu>, I\'d just like
to add an overwhelming nod of agreement. Mix and match. I have no idea what
TNE is like as I have never perused a copy, but I\'m seriously thinking of
picking up a copy. There appears to be a lot of stuff in there that could
become very useful. I\'m not much of a Ref really, but I like to be a rules
lawyer at times. I like detailing a game system. To me, the Virus idea stinks.
But that\'s just my opinion. The RULES system does seem to fill in a lot of
blanks. If you don\'t like it, change it, or don\'t buy it. Don\'t b*tch about
it. Hey, why don\'t we all get together and design a new role playing game?
Collectively we all have enough knowledge of SF to do it...

	 By the way, Loren, if you\'re listening, I\'m not proposing a conspiracy.
More a creative endeavor.

     And finaly , but not leastly, thanks goes out to James Kundert
<j.kundert@genie.geis.com> for his further reply on that missing Jump Rule.
Boy do I have a few designs to change!

     Anyhow, gotta get to bed.

  If you\'re referring to the designation used in CT (the little
  black books), then a M/1bis was for all intents and purposes a
  M/1 with the mass storage subsystems of a M/2.  It seems that
  "bis" was used in the same manner that it is in
  telecommunications, i.e., fits the basic spec, but is enhanced in
  some way (cf. V.32 versus V.32bis with regards to modems...).  In
  that sense, one could say that a M/anything greater than 1 was in
  fact a M/1bis, but since there was already a M/2 et cetera, the
  M/1bis was simply used to designate the hybrid.  If you consider
  today\'s typical MS-DOS PC as being a M/1 (not really accurate;
  see other posts on the computer thread), then a M/1bis would be a
  PC with the kind of mass storage that you see on major bulletin
  board systems (cf. Exec-PC, in the midwest U.S.) or large
  departmental servers (i.e., storage measured in GB, not MB).

  Or so runs my interpretation; as is usual in RPGs, your mileage
  may vary...

Well it seems as though what everyone around here is saying is that they
like the TNE rules (for the most part), and just hate what GDW did with
the story.  So, someone had a good suggestion, and that was having
stories/adventures that take place during the Hard Times, the Rebellion,
between Hard Times and TNE, but have these adventures use the TNE
system.  Well, if these mailing list have any type of input with GDW (I
know that they are aware of a few of the other Traveller lists), then
why don\'t we let them know how we feel?  Why don\'t we organize something
like a letter or a statement or something silly like that sign it, and
send it to them?

Oh well, enough ranting.

I\'ve been playing around with FF&S and decided to build a TL 5 cargo
Zepplin.  I\'ve completed it.  It carries a 100 tonnes of cargo at a
max speed of 180 Kph.  The design currently rests on a desk blotter
sized peice of graph paper.  I\'ll redo it on a spread sheet and post
the results here.
   The cargo bay is a 100 Displacement Tonne gondola.  The 100 tonnes
of Mass is figured into the lift equations.  This cargo area could be
replaced by passenger cabins (air liner), hanger space or bomb racks.
   Oh ya...It\'s a hydrogen gas bag.  A helium version would have a
slightly bigger gas bag.  Once I get it spreadsheeted, I\'ll work out
the size of a helium version.

TL 5 Cigar shaped Rigid Airship (Hydrogen)

Useful Lift: 1365 Tonnes
Thrust: 100 Tonnes (TL5 Propellers)
Max Speed: 200 Kph
Cruising Speed: 150 Kph
Combat Move: 27.8
Travel Move: 600
Endurance: 120 Hours
Range: 18,000 Kilometers
Volume of Envelope: 227,576.54 Displacement Tonnes
Cost: MCr 184.60367

This Airship has 6 Gondolas.  The control, cargo and four engine.
Each Gondola is a a simple airframe.

The Main Gondola consists of:
  Flight Deck:
   Open Crewstations for:
        Pilot
        Co-Pilot
        Navigator
        Radio Operator
        Flight Engineer

   TL 5 300 Km Radio (0.1 square meter antenna)
   TL 5 Navigational Aids
        Gyro Compass
        Barmetric Altimeter
   TL 4 Search Light (6 attached around the gondola)
   TL 5 Improved Internal Combustion Engine; 0.25 m^3; producing 0.1 MW
        Main Gondola power requirements = 0.0215 MW
   3 Kiloliters of HCD fuel to power the engine for 120 hours
   1.75 Tonne ships locker.

The Cargo Gondola consists of:
  1400 m^3 of cargo space.

Each of the four Engine Gondolas consists of:
  1 44.642856 m^3 TL 5 Improved Combustion Engine producing 35.714285 MW
  TL 5 Propeller
     This combination produces 25 tonnes of thrust.

The four Engine Gondolas produce a total of 100 tonnes of thrust.

The fuel for the 4 propulsion engines (1071.4285 Klt) is stored in the
Envelope (76,54 diplacement tonnes were added when figuring the weight
of the envelope)

Notes:
  The 1.75 tonne ships locker is fudge space for weight.  Light weapons
can be added or 3 crew bunks or more radio/sensor equipment.

  The cargo Gondola is has 100 displacement tonnes of open space.  100 tonnes
of Mass were figured into the lift equations.  There are several options
available besides flat cargo space.

 - More engines and propellers can be be added.  The ship is at the maxium
   speed already, but adding more thrust will improve handling (adding
   modifiers to piloting rolls).

 - Cabins (and a small engine to handle the power requirements) can be
   installed, turning this craft into a passenger liner.

 - Bomb or missle racks can be added.  I personally would suggest replacing
   the hydrogen with helium of this is to be taken into a combat zone.

When I get this spreadsheeted, I will upload the 1-2-3 format file to the
main TML archives.

the actual silicon beasty can\'t travel to the other machine and re-write
it\'s circuitry. It\'s made explaining my worlds a bit easier. There\'s
also the point that they can still \'write\' their own virus\'s to carry
themselves to points unknown, etc. Anyway, the campaign.

I used the near star map (the closest 26 parsecs that folks have been
talking about occasionally here) and started detailing out star systems.  I
picked a system (#587 for those of you who have the list) and detailed it as
Joydel, a TL8 system rediscovering JumpDrive from the ruins of a scout base.
There\'s other details as they go - but I generally run a campaign like some
SF writers write in a Universe: A number of stories (adventures) set in a
common universe (area of space) - sometimes with the same characters.
Allowing the players to switch characters between adventures keeps them
happy with one game system longer from what I\'ve found - and I said they
could develop any of their contacts into full PCs to run at a later date.

If anyone\'s interested - I\'m keeping VERY close notes of the setup and
would be happy to share them. It\'s essentially a 3D space traveller, using
the destruction of the Imperium to allow me to easily map a small area of
\'what could have been\' imperial space for the purposes of some adventures.
Hey - so it goes. I\'m also hoping that some of these adventures will show
in TTC or Challenge... we\'ll see.

Anyone else have a campaign or adventure happenin\' in TNE?

I just dug into the small arms section of FF&S.  It lists the basic
size of several popular rounds, 7.62x51mm, 7.62x25mm and 18.5x70mm.
Off the top of my head I came up with 7.62x39.  Could someone in the

9mmP, .22 Long Rifle, .38 Special, .44 & .45 Colt, .45 APC and 30-06
would be nice.

Two points:

A 4 guage shotgun is over 20mm in bore diameter yet \'technically\' can not
be designed.  (A friend made the valid point that it isn\'t really a small
arm as much as a cannon though)

The rules say that you cannot have necked cartriges in a grip magazine.
The Soviet Tokarev used 7.62*25mm NECKED cartriges.
My junior gunsmith friends say that necked cartriges actually feed better in
Autoloaders.

I\'m planning on submitted this to GDW as well, so maybe (just maybe) it
might even be official someday.

"Standard" computers in TNE are the mainframe/supercomputer/server analogs
to todays machines. These machines run multiple programs and store
tremendous amounts of information - and are meant to be connected to other
machines which serve as terminals. According to FFS (Fire, Fusion, and
Steel) these machines can serve as diagnosticians for flight ships and
reduce maintenance levels.

A more compacted (and cheaper) version of these machines are "Flight"
computers. These machines are streamlined for special purposes - anything
from database functions to calculating the proper lift surface configuration
for flight. Flight computers have their volume, power requirements, and mass
divided by 10, and their price divided by 1000.

There are also FiberOptic version for both standard and flight computers.
These machines are largely immune to the effects of radiation damage
(according to the original Traveller rules). TNE mentions that usually one
of the machines onboard a ship is FiberOptic. FiberOptic machines have their
volume, mass, and price multiplied by 2.

     "Implant" computers (FFS, page #84)
Model#    TL   Mass(kg)  Price(MCr)
  7M       12    1.0       0.5
  8M       13    1.0       0.4
  9M       14    1.0       0.4
  10M      15    1.2       0.6
  11M      16    1.4       1.0
  12M      17    1.6       1.2
  13M      18    1.8       1.8
  14M      19    1.6       2.4
  15M      20    1.4       3.0

"Implant" computers are the relatively equivilant to flight computers. These
machines primarily direct any cybernbetics and interface directly to the
brain. Like flight computers, they can not reduce the maintenance levels for
starships & the like, but can calc jump parameters and allow a person to fly
a starship. Details on how it effects abilities are below.

  EXTRAPOLATED DATA for smaller (& larger) machines.

 15D      17    2.8     3.5        .12

These machines are roughly equivilant to the mainframe computer of two tech
levels earlier. They can be interfaced directly into starship systems and
it\'s possible to use them to reduce maintenance levels as per their model
number. FiberOptic versions are available at twice the volume, mass, and
cost. Flight versions are also available at half the volume and mass and one
fourth the cost. The flight versions of these computers are often used as
powerful terminals in connection to the larger "standard" computers for
their tech level.

Handheld computers are the smallest computers (aside from inplants) readily
available. The handheld models function equivilant to flight computers from
four tech levels earlier. At tech level 13, Handheld versions equivilant to
standard models can be found for twice the volume and mass and three times
the price.

Some rules for using computers:

In FFS, there are some comments about using the implant computers to make
queries regarding general and specific topics - and a description which
identified them as essentially flight computers for comparison. From that,
I\'ve worked out some general rules:

For the purposes of answering general queries - the flight equivilant
computers have an asset of 8, and the standard equivilant computers have an
asset of 12. A general question regarding well known information would be an
easy or average task, a specific question would be a difficult task, and a
very specific question would be a formidable (or impossible) task -
depending on the referee.

An additional rule (mentioned in FFS) is that players can "optimize" their
computers knowledge base around specific topics before a game. The number of
topics they can optimize around is based on the (model# - 6). i.e. a TL9
computer could be optimized for three topics. This decreases the difficulty
of the task by one for those specific topics (how specific is left
unspecified), and increases the difficulty of the task for general
(non-topic) questions by a DM of -2.

For purposes of involving the "software" skills for those with a implant
computer or a direct neural interface, you can optimize the computer around
that specific skill (instead of a topic) and gain a -1 difficulty when using
"intelligence" based skills and a -2 difficulty when using "education" based
skills.

  For those happily hacking away with their copies of FF&S and have access
to USENET news groups, I would like to make a suggestion.  Read the
Sci.Military newsgroup.  There was a great thread on powered personal
armor about two years ago (I\'ve got a copy.  If you would like it, email me.
If there is enough response, I\'ll post it.)
  Currently there is a thread on light tanks, their past, their proper use
and how to build a good one.

    'body' => 'My two cents follow on reasons for hating T:TNE (which I do not).

Go on if the discussion has tired you out.

The problem I am having with T:TNE is, in fact, that it is different.

I don\'t know about the rest of you, but I have spent some
serious dinero on gaming over the past 10 years or so.  One
of the first games I picked up was Traveller, because I could
add to my material for as little as $3.00 (for one of those
half sized \'Books\' or \'supplements\' or \'Adventures).

I have kept up with the products ever since.  I think Traveller
lasted about 12 years, 1977 to 1989 (corrections please?) before
the release of Megatraveller.  MT was not a serious departure,
which was good since by then I had about 35 books, supplements,
and adventures, as well as Judges Guild Subsector maps, alien
modules etc. etc.

Megatraveller went up on the shelf in \'89, I immediately bought
the basic set ($25 or so).  Then each of the supplementary
source books (Ref\'s companion, Fighting ships, rebellion sourcebk)
at $10.00 each.  I wrote an Appleworks, then a lotus, then an excel
spreadsheet for starship construction.  I generated a full sector
of planetary detail and made my own map for it.

The thing is, MT was \'easily` compatible with CT.  The ships
could be converted in about 15-20 minutes, and performance of the
CT ship would (usually) work in the MT ship.  Characters and worlds
were similarly convertable.

I Like T:TNE.  It\'s a good game.  It is not \'easily\' compatable
with the CT  and MT material I have, which is a tremendous waste to me.
It seems like T:MT was not allowed to develop and florish as it
should, as CT did.  4 years is quite a short time for GDW to give
it.  I\'m not ready to give up all the work and money that has gone
into MT!

There, I vented.  Now maybe I can get on with my gaming life.  Maybe
I should go back to AD&D.  WHAT? You say there\'s a Second Edition?

While TNE may be selling well, and a fair number of TNE campaigns may
be starting up, I\'d be willing to bet that the health of the TML is a
more serious issue than most people suspect.  A significant number of
TML\'ers are diehard Trav Classic/MegaTrav players and have no plans to
purchase and use TNE.  Thus they probably will not be participating
in any of the current discussions.

Only a couple years ago, Mike Metlay and I were two of the most vocal
and frequent posters to this mail-list.  I have posted less than ten
notes in the last year, and Metlay has completely dropped off the list
(he hasn\'t been a subscriber for a year or so.)  The reason for this
is very simple, and has nothing (or not much, at least) to do with
the change in rules: They (GDW) killed the Imperium.

The Imperium was what made the game fun for us.  The rules were so-so.
Some were good (we kept them), and some weren\'t (we fixed them).  Then
they introduced that stupid f**king virus, shattered the Imperium, and
assassinated Brzk to boot.  They could have fixed the broken rules without
doing all of that.

The rationale is that they wanted to introduce new blood into the game
and lure in new players.  The mechanism they used appears to have worked,
but at the cost of disaffecting most of the old players.  That wasn\'t
necessary.

Why not use the new rules and keep the old campaign you ask?  Simple.
I don\'t buy GDW Traveller material for the rules, I buy it for the
richness it adds to a game universe I\'ve grown to love.  I now know
that I\'ll never again see another new adventure or supplement published
that enhances that universe (unless Metlay ever finishes and publishes
his "It Never Happened" module.) It\'s been utterly eliminated, and a dark
munchkin paradise has replaced it.

If you think the TML is in sad shape, then you\'re right.  The chief cause
of the problem is located in a small office in Bloomington, Illinois.

old distinction between "Major" and "Minor" sentient races has vanished.  The
little guys like Vegans and Ael Yael are in exactly the same boat as the big-
league species.
	In fact, they may be better off in some cases.  Low-tech sentient
races will hardly be affected at all by the crash.  Their civilizations will
continue as before, only without any interference from starfaring busybodies.
And the homeworlds of minor races might recover quickly from the Collapse --
much faster than any colony world.  (A couple of months ago I posted a mini-
essay on why Terra probably weathered the Virus better than almost any other
planet.)
	So intrepid explorers venturing into the Wilds are likely to find a
fair number of pocket empires centered on the homeworlds of minor races.  But
if they have a pocket empire, well . . . they aren\'t very "minor" anymore, are
they?  It would be excellent if the ongoing history of the Traveller universe
saw a shakeup in the roster of "Major" and "Minor" races.  Perhaps the old
distinction between Solomani and Imperials will vanish, so Humans will make up
a single race.  And maybe the Vegans or whoever can attain Major race status,
as the Aslan did during the Long Night.

The arguments I\'ve heard go as follows:

A:	2D sucks, I use 3D

B:	Yeah, but when you use 3D you have to throw out the Imperium and
	all its history.  I like the 2D, I rationalize it by saying that
	jump space is 2D, and doesn\'t map directly into 3D.

C:	I don\'t rationalize or worry. 2D maps are far more useful from a
	playability standpoint.  Ever try to map out 3D jump routes, or
	have players flip through pages of maps just to "connect the
	dots" on a 3D map?

A:	Well, that\'s true, but I\'ve had my computer at sessions, and
	have it display the 3-space, and when I don\'t have the computer
	around, I have a report listing all my systems. Each system
	contains a list of other systems that can be reached with a J-1,
	J-2, etc.  Of course, I\'m a computer enthusiast, and no-one else
	can run this program effectively...

 ... and so on.  Take your pick.  Me, I\'m in the C category.  BTW, I\'ve
shared this reply with the TML.

  Hadn\'t really thought of trying this one,  but you\'re both right.  First
  suggestion would be to bend the rules some,  and design it as a small arms
  weapon anyway.  One note when designing shotguns:  design the round as a TL-4
  round.  GDW apparently did that when they re-did the TNE stats,  and it gives
  you reasonable numbers for the weights and length of the reciever.
  ( I had to drop the TL on a number of the rounds while re-doing my 2300AD
    conversions. It\'s a good way to drop the energy of a round, IMO. )

  In the notes at the beginning of the Small Arms section it talks about these.
  I don\'t think the game performance of the rounds is that different than the
  \'straight\' round would be.  I think GDW opted to slide the necked pistol
  rounds into the \'straight\' category for simplicity.  Loren might now for sure,
  this is simply an educated guess.

Comments: The 5631 model Police Spinner replaced the 5620 model used by the
NeuBerlin Metro Police Force in early 5631. It is entirely constructed on
Neubayern, and is one of the first vehicles to use the new TL14 fuel
cells that went into production that year. The Police Spinner is a
variant on the Randall Motors Scorpio, a civilian spinner that carries
additional passengers in place of the Police Spinner\'s sensor suite and
armour.

The Police Spinner is shaped somewhat like a Y, with the narrow end being
the nose of the Spinner. There are three wheels, which are retracted
flush with the bottom of the vehicle when airborne. The passengers sit in
the broad rear section of the vehicle.

> I just dug into the small arms section of FF&S. ... Could someone in the
know please list some other stats for popular rounds?

Sure Mark!  By the way, some tips for all of you:

FF&S small arms design tip #1 - Converting Real World Cartridges.
In general, converting rounds to FF&S using the cartridge dimensions doesn\'t
work very well.  In the real world, cartridge dimensions and nominal muzzle
energy are (of course) related, but in the there is a much greater variation
of cartridge size and shape than FF&S recognises (for example, necked pistol
cartridges that FF&S treats as straight), and amount of powder actually loaded
(you don\'t have to fill the case to maxiumu capacity), and even types of
powder (each different powder has different burning characteristics).  All of
these factors affect the practical amount of energy you can get out of the
cartridge when fired from a real gun.

The *best* way to "design" a specific weapon in FF&S is to arrange the
actual muzzle energy of your designed weapon to match the actual muzzle
energy of the model "real world" weapon.  Work the cartridge design backward
from there, and the weapon design forward from that point.  This is,
however, a large pain in the posterior to *do* (I\'m working on deriving some
formulas to make it easier - more later!).  Another tactic would be to use
the real world weapon information (you\'ll need muzzle energy, loaded mass,
and a few other statistics) and compute only those game statistics you need
(like damage, penetration, and recoil values) from FF&S formulae.  In this
case, you will have rated a 100% real weapon for Traveller.

The next best (and much easier) method is to design a cartridge that yeilds
an "average" energy about what the published energy is for the real world
round that you want to duplicate.  This is easier, but introduces some small
error (because the FF&S "average" barrel length will nearly never match the
length of the standard test barrels that the real world manufacturer uses to
rate the ammunition).

FF&S small arms design tip #2 - Don\'t Sweat It.
FF&S (and the T:TNE role-playing system in general) paints small arms with a
pretty broad brush.  The differences between roughly comparable real world
small arms is more-or-less negligable when designing weapons in FF&S.  All
weapons with about the same energy will come out about the same mass, and
with about the same penetration and damage.  The rest is just "color":
"Well, the InStellArms R-352 \'Lacerator\' is a bull-pup design with integral
optic sight; it\'s certainly adequate, but notice the superior design and
quality construction on our MegaKillCo IIW-321 \'Mauler\', which is very
similar in features and price."

FF&S small arms design tip #3 - Use the Breakpoints, Use the Breakpoints!
If you look at the formula for damage, and the table which is used to find
penetration, you will see that certain energies will produce the most damage
or penetration for the least muzzle energy (and since just about everything
in the FF&S small arms sequence is based on energy, this translates into a
lighter, cheaper weapon).  There\'s nothing wrong (and lots of things right)
about \'tweaking\' a design up or down a few percent to take advantage of a
favorable breakpoint (and yes, there are energies which are particularly
inefficient, and tweaking down is more practical than tweaking up).


Now, here\'s a table that gives dimensions in mm, and the "common name" of
just about every round that was readily available for research.  You can
figure out the diameter in inches by dividing the size in mm by 25.4 (this
is an exact conversion).  I also listed some of the more common weapons that
use this ammunition, in the hopes that either the common name or a weapon name
would provide a memory handle you can use to relate everything.  Pistol and
rifle rounds are listed together on the list; you will notice that pistols
generally have shorter cartridges, though.

The "Designation" follows the NATO standard for such things, and is simply
the diameter of the projectile by the length of the cartridge case, both
measured in millimeters.  So, the .357 Magnum is 9mm in diameter, and the
cartridge case is 33mm long.  The letters at the end of the designation
indicate the style of the rim at the base of the cartridge.  No letter is
a standard rimless cartridge as used in most modern designs (rimless
cartridges feed better through belts and magazines).  A "R" indicates a
rimmed cartridge, which is a very old style and commonly found only in
revolvers.  "SR" indicates a semi-rimmed round; this is a compromise between
the easier extraction of a rimmed case and the easier feeding of the rimless
design.  A "B" indicates a belted case, used on very powerful rounds to
give the cartridge extra strength.  And last (but not least) a "C" indicates
a caseless round.

The "Energy" is in thousands of joules (kilojoules, or kj).

The "Name" is the common name of the round.  "ACP" stands for "Automatic
Colt Pistol", used in several different calibers of automatic pistol
ammunition (the Colt "Government" .45 Auto is .45 ACP).  Decimal numbers are
fractions of an inch, the usual non-metric way of measuring a weapon\'s
caliber.

The "Used In" column mentions some (but by no means all) weapons which fire
the ammunition.  Note that some weapons are available in different calibers,
either from the factory, or due to conversion kits, or because some
ammunition is "upward compatible".  One example if this is .38 Special and
 .357 Magnum.  Revolvers chambered for .357 Magnum can also fire .38 Special
(but *NOT* the other way around!).

Comments: a couple of rounds on there aren\'t in production, or are from
experimental or developmental weapons.  The XM645 was for an experimental
rifle developed during the 1960\'s.  While not a practical weapon, it could
be taken as an indication of what Gauss weapons should be capable of.
Similarly, the G-11 caseless round has been changed since my reference has
been published, but I don\'t have newer data.

Source: _The Armory_, by Kevin Dockery.  Kevin has a new book on small arms
available; it should be in game stores now.  This book (I haven\'t read it
yet - FF&S is taking priority) appears to have enough data to convert any of
the weapons listed to T:TNE.

I\'ve been fiddling with high-tech striker and high-guard, and I thought that
a battlefield meson accelerator would make a nice addition to a 50ton company-

I noticed a few ambiguities, namely regarding weapon accuracy and range.  If
anyone\'s dealt with BFMGs in striker before and already resolved this, I\'d
really appreciate some feed-back.

Loren:  If this could be fixed in "striker-2", I\'d send you fan-mail for at
least a month...  :)

BTW, I wasn\'t planning on an an anti-ship weapon, just anti-personnel and anti-
"armor", but it seems to me that the battlefield meson accelerator has quite a
bit going for it as a ship-to-ship weapon if some thought were put to it.

would work.

Crewing a ship. You don\'t *have* to have 2 Maneuvering pilots when the only
two drives on the ship are Jump & a Fusion Rocket (or HEPLar, or whatever),
so I dropped the Maneuvering position down to 1.

Electronics is currently calc\'d at #Comm + #Sensors x Computer Multiplier.
Well - okay - to run everything all the time, you might need someone. But
there\'s not reason to run ALL of it all the time, so you might figure the #
req\'d in combat and general operation - and it usually falls much lower. For
example, if you had a Densitometer, Neutrino, and NAS all stuck in the ship
- - there\'s three sensor\'s you\'d never use on an emergency basis (actually -
I\'ve seen the Densitometer used that way, but...). Anyway - that takes down
three, plus I almost *alyways* keep multiple comm links in a ship (2 Maser,
1 radio) and PCs rarely use more than one at a time, which removes another
2... you get the idea.

Gunnery - I leave it at simply a person for each weapon, instead of
including one for the MFD. My view of that box is something along the lines
of the targeting system in modern fighters - it just let\'s you know when
you\'re on target and have a lock for missles. Each gunner can choose to work
with it or not, but it\'s not something that requires a person manning it.

Engineering I pretty much leave as is. It\'s based off maintenance points,
and without re-writing all those rules (which I kind of like anyway), I
leave the engineering staff as is. I very often have extra engineers as NPCs
on boats anyway - they\'re a good place to put humor&/or intrigue (or just
plain cannon fodder) when needed.

All these details are for Brilliant Lances/FFS supplements to TNE (which are
the bits that include the rules for calc\'ing a ship\'s crew requirement).

Anyone else have mod\'s that they use to help out PC\'s running a ship?

Your suggestions make good sense for \'small\' ships crewed by player
characters.  Most referees want to keep the number of NPCs down, and so the
players will frequently be the only crew of a small starship (typically
ships of 100 to 400 tons).  So, operating these ships with reduced crews is
important to many campaigns.

One way to treat this in the game is to assume that the crew requirements
calculated according to the design rules are the "official" numbers, based
on the various rules and regulations (of the Imperium, a Pocket Empire, the
Navy involved, or whatever).  You *can* operate a ship with a minimum crew
much smaller than this, though.  As long as you\'ve got a Pilot, Astrogator,
and some Ship\'s Engineers, you can make the ship go (you\'ll probably want
someone to run the sensor too, though) although if you don\'t have enough
crew to make the ship\'s maintainance, you will have serious problems in the
long run.

Presumably small "tramp" ships operated in private service aren\'t inspected
often (or at all) for infractions of relatively minor things as the crew
complement regulations (although operating with a short crew is a great way
to harass PCs that need it).  Annoying starport officials is a good way to
trigger an inspection, I\'ve found.  Larger ships are a different story, though.

Large military vessels are generally operated by a military or paramilitary
organization (like the Navy, Scout Service, Patrol, or a starmerc unit).
In general, unless you want a career-killing performance review, you\'d
better operate "by the book" unless you have a *very* good excuse (like the
entire rest of the ship\'s complement are casualties of your last
engagement).  If you\'re running a military campaign, this generally isn\'t a
problem unless the referee wants it to be.

Large civillian vessels are generally operated in commercial service.  As
the value of the ship, the number of passengers, and the value of the
cargoes increase, so do the frequency and zeal with which the regulations
are enforced.  Failing to keep the proper crew complement on the books can
result in fines, groundings, and loss of insurance coverage.  If you\'re
running a merchant campaign, all of these things can be tossed at the PCs to
make their lives complicated.

With the T:TNE starship weapons and MFDs, I\'d work it a little differently.

It seems to me that the gunner in the turret can operate that turret by
local control, while the gunner in the MFD (which I imagine as a sort of a
fire control center located on either the main bridge or on a fire control
bridge).  The one MFD controls all of the weapons in it\'s battery (that is,
the group of weapons it\'s linked to), and is operated by one person, the
battery director.

To operate at full effectiveness, you\'d want to have both the MFD and the
turrets manned.  The gunner in the MFD would ordinarily fire the whole
battery (much like the gunnery director [a person] in the fire control
center of a battleship) and thereby get the bonuses for central fire
direction through the MFD.  The gunners in the turrets can fire under local
control if need be (for example, if the MFD is knocked out, or if the
battery has to engage multiple targets at once - up to one for each
turret) but then they don\'t get bonuses for the MFD.

When reducing the crew, one gunner in the MFD can control the entire battery
without needing to have the turrets manned.  However, if the MFD is knocked
out, then none of the turrets can fire.  You could also leave the MFD
unmanned, but then you wouldn\'t get it\'s benefits.

Depending on the TL and wear value of the ship, PCs operating with a reduced
crew may have their hands *very* full keeping ahead of the maintainance.

> Anyone else have mod\'s that they use to help out PC\'s running a ship?

A couple of obvious ones: A ship that doesn\'t have any high passengers
doesn\'t need any stewards (the PCs can eat their own cooking, or at least so
they hope).  A medic can be dispensed with if need be, and any PC with the
appropriate skill can handle the small craft (Air/Raft or Ship\'s Boat).

  I was playing around with the smallarms design rules  last night.  It\'s
pretty stright foward.  The trickest part is designing the round.  That\'s the
key part.  The round determines muzzle energy, which effects your damage and
recoil.
  My first attempt was a .45 caliber (11.43x23mm) semiautomatic pistol.
I decided to have some fun and made it a TL9 ETC round.  Things looked
great till I figured out the recoil. It was just over six!  I switched
to a heavy receiver (weight modifies recoil) and added a muzzle break.
Recoil dropped to 5.98. :-)  Form my next trick, I\'ll drop the TL to 5
and try to make a Colt 1911 pistol.
  It shows promise for a decent carbine though.  Longer (and heavier)
barrel, longer muzzle break, shock absorbing stock and changing from a
grip magazine to a box magazine (this will increase the size of the
receiver.  Hopefully the extra weight will help also).

It\'s using a Fusion Rocket for it\'s primary

it only produces .5G Thrust for 2 hours - enough to simply move away

Variations might include using part of the cargo hold for fuel -
another  280kl would allow another Jump1. Fuel purification machinery
might also be installed in the hold. A 60kl fuel processing plant
would process 320kl in 19.2 hours, or 600kl fuel in 36 hours.

I created this ship with the idea of the classic \'flying saucer\' - and
incorporated a design easily modified to suit a variety of \'frontier\'
needs - including combat. The 200MW power plant will easily drive a
laser, sandcaster, or missle launcher in the extra turret. In
addition, the hold could be converted to carry any number of small
vehicles - up to approx 23 displacement tons (giving a 1.6x leeway for
being in a cargo hold)

I\'ve done some work on the TNE crew level problem (how much it differs
from previous levels).

My solution was to use something Wildstar outlined, but with some modifications.

(obligatory dopey acronym:)

HAIS  (High Automation Integrated Systems)

volume= vol of (powerplant+J-drive+M-drive+sensors+weapons)*0.01
   (maybe change to something less, this needs design testing)
mass  = volume (in tonnes)
cost  = 1 MCr/14kl
power = (still needs testing, figure something between a flight computer
         and the basic controls requirements. Ie: something token
         [thanks joe])

Minimum Size: TL9-: 5 (displacement) tons. TL10-12: 2tons, 13+: 1ton

Engineering Crew: FFS formula * 0.25 (round fractions up)
Electronics Crew: FFS* 0.25 (round down)
Maneuver Crew: no change
Gunnery Crew:  see below
Maintainence :  FFS * 0.25 (round down)
Ship\'s troops: no change
command : no change (FFS based on modified numbers above)
stewards (no Change)
medical  (no change)

HAIS ships divide their maintainence points by 4, after all other
MP calculations are done (round fractions up)

Gunnery Crew: on ships with HAIS, weapons fire can be conducted
    completely from MFD\'s, and due to the combat advantages of
    doing so, it usually is.  Many (if not all) local weapons
    crewstations are left unmanned, serving as emergency backup
    only.  When the ship is designed, the designers figure "usual"
    battery arrangements, install MFD`s to suit, and base gunnery
    crew levels on that.

Specific requirements:

Black Globes: BG\'s are always fully manned
Meson Screens: Meson screens are always fully manned
Damper turrets and screens: Always fully manned
Turret weapons: May be left unmanned, and controlled by MFD, within
                MFD limits (only like weapons at one time, etc)
Larger weapons: any weapon with a crew greater than 2 may not be left
                unmanned.(ie: crew of 3+ means no leaving it alone)

Note that larger weapons, like a spinal mount with a crew of one,
may be left unmanned locally, but likely will have an MFD unofficially
dedicated to its exclusive use.

Crew is the number of MFD\'s, plus the number of local weapons crews
the designers feel necesary to include.

I tried this with the Midu Agaaaawhatever 3000 ton destroyer,
and got the crew down to 46, with the ability to lose a few more,
depending on how many gun crew I want.  CT crew was 33, MT was 47.

Pre- Virus:

HAIS is common in all Vilani, Zhodani, and Solomani-influenced regions.
Among aliens:

Aslan do not commonly use HAIS in ship designs.
K\'Kree never leave home without it.
Hivers use it
Vargr usage varies widely (did you expect any different?)
Droyne: ? maybe yes, maybe no, ref\'s discretion.

HAIS ships are highly vulnerable to becoming Vampire ships in the
event of Virus infection, due to the high level if connectivity
and automation.
When non-HAIS ships are infected, the Virus is limited to only the
infected sub-system.

The Imperial Navy and Zhodani Navy designs presented in Brilliant Lances
are actually the post-Virus refits of those designs, eliminating the
HAIS systems.  The volume gained using HAIS is mostly devoted to
extra fuel. Weapons load remains unchanged



Thoughts?

Something that tends to get glossed over when calculating crews is the
different shifts needed  eg 3 x 8 hour shifts for full 24 hour a day
operation.  If pressed you can man 2/3 of your systems all the time and
wake the other 1/3 for emergency or combat.  I use thirds so you can
stagger and overlap shifts but on large ships you may want 4 or 5 shifts.

What do they do onboard real world destroyers, cruisers, etc?

Short period travel vehicles of less than 48 hours would be exceptions
to the crewing rules eg fighter planes, trains, trucks etc.

It\'s ok to say you can get by on 1 pilot for two drives but how long
will that pilot be actively piloting.  This is not a 9 to 5 job and you
will need a co-pilot even if just for those times you\'re navigating
through an asteroid belt and the pilot needs to go to the loo 8^}.

I suppose you could set course and hope the early warning system wakes you
in time to avoid that pirate or asteroid.

The polite thing to do is to copy what the other fellow said.  This
allows: 1) other people to see what they said and 2) prevents you from
misquoting them.

I wasn\'t upset.  Anthony Neal said:

You answered yourself there :-)  But I do have a copy of Survival Margin.

Then you said:

Right so far...

>Now, you said that ships transferred okay between Classic and MT, but

>and MT were radically different.

Hmmm... I know I THINK this, but I couldn\'t find where I posted this
on this list, so I\'m not sure if I\'m being misquoted or not ;-)

Right, the RULES were different, but the results were largely the same:
everything still fit on the hull, so Kinunir and Broadsword conversions
left the ships with the same characteristics.  Under TNE, things like
triple turrets and particle accelerator barbettes are gone, so if your
ship had them in CT and MT, how do you explain to your players that
they don\'t exist in TNE?

Other missing things that carried over from CT to MT but not to TNE are:
Effectively unlimited ship movement
Crew Sizes (they increased slightly with MT, but doubled with TNE)
How Nuclear Dampeners work
Anti-Grav devices providing thrust
etc.etc.  Duplicating CT ship designs was easy in MT: nothing "disappeared".
This isn\'t the case with TNE.

Anyway, I\'m recapping this stuff because you\'re new to the list.  Most of the
other people on this list are bored to tears/sleep/death by this topic.

You go on to say:

>Ships in MT (and their creation rules) weren\'t compatible with High
>Guard and Trillion Credit Squadron.  All of the CT ships had to be
>completely reworked to fit into MT.

Not really, see above.  Redesigned, yes.  Re-explained, no.

Nah.  They majorly changed the game.

But can your players?

You conclude:

>As for the rules of play, well, they\'re different enough that you need

>to the old rules.

Except that combat isn\'t as dangerous, you run out of fuel in
space combat, in system transit times are alot slowers, blah blah blah.

I _LIKE_ TNE, but I\'m trying to convert an existing campaign. Had they
retained alot of the building blocks of CT and MT, they would have alienated
fewer long time players and made conversion MUCH easier.

Thank you, I actually *have* SM, but haven\'t yet waded through it
(I just finished T:TNE).

I should clarify, my point (after reading T:TNE, but without even
*seeing* FFS or BL) is that the weapon systems and general concepts
between CT and MT are pretty much identical, but are changed in
T:TNE.  In other words, Yes! the design system was changed
radically.  However, no weapon systems or propulsion systems
were eliminated, major components took *about* the same amount
of space and were the same general configuration.  By playing "fast
and loose" with the rules and doing some "backward engineering" I
could come up with a Kinunir Class Cruiser that would be familiar
to the players who went through Adventure 1 with me, pretty quickly
too, but compatible at least in terms of game balance with MT.

Now TNE comes along; gone are shipboard fusion, plasma, and particle
accelerator weapons (again, I do not know if these are in BL/FFS). Pro-
Pulsion technology is seriously revamped.  Crew requirements increased
greatly (with concessions to the discussions of how to reduce crew needs
currently going on) I can not fit my Kinunir reasonably into the TNE
universe (or the several dozen craft I have designed myself).

Again let me say; Thank You all for putting up with my venting.  It
feels good to be able to bitch about these things to an audience
which can help/understand/sympathize (and even respond to the contrary
KOTL).  I *will* be switching to TNE (as soon as I get get my hands
on FFS, BL, and others), but I will be facing the problems that
most of you will be or have faced.

By the way, has anyone come up with a computer based vehicle or
character generation program?  for IBM PC specifically.  Or a
world generator?  (are worlds still compatible?)  If so please
put them in the archive and announce

I will probably try to develop an Excel model for ships & vehicles
as soon as I have the materials.

I\'ve cooked up some "Rules of Thumb" from the FF&S rules to aid designers.


Custom Turrets:

For the dimensions of non-standard turrets and barbettes,
the radius of the turret is equal to the cube root of the
volume in cubic meters, multiplied by 0.515:

r=0.515[V^(1/3)]

The Diameter of the turret = 2*r
The Height of the turret   = 2.3333*r
- ----

Particle Accellerator Length:

The minimum length of a PAW for its effective range to be equal
to a given range (in BL hexes) goes by the following formula:

                  [     H      ]^(1/3)
       L = 13.47* [---- ]
                  [  Ml * Mfa  ]

L= minimum length of PAW in meters
H= desired range in BL hexes
Ml= Length Multiplier (see table pg. 113)
Mfa= Focal Area Multiplier (see table pg. 113)
- ----

Meson Gun Length:

The minimum length of a Meson gun for its effective range to be
equal to a given range (in BL hexes) goes by:

                 [  30 * H  ]
            L =  [----]
                 [    Ml    ]

L = minimum length of Meson Gun in meters
H = desired range in BL hexes
Ml= Length Multiplier (see table pg. 117)
- ----

PAW Penetration:

If a PAW is operating at the maximum Mj for its length, its
penetration value within its effective range is equal to:

          Pv = 5 * length (in meters)
- ----

PAW design notes:

If a PAW operates at the maximum Mj for its length (and most will),
the damage it can do depends on how long it is.  This is not affected
by tech level.  Tech level affects the effective range only

For example, a TL 9 PAW can have an effective range of 80 BL hexes
(ie. maximum combat range) if it is at least 112 meters long.
A 112m PAW can deliver up to 12,544 Mj, and will do so even if
the PAW is TL 15, not TL 9.

However, the TL 9 PAW _MUST_ have its maximum bore (1/8th length)
to acheive this range.  Higher TL versions have the option of
reducing the focal area (and thus the volume, making for a more
compact weapon), or keeping the range overcapacity to improve
the weapon\'s performance during planetary bombardments.


The effective range of a PAW grows (most of the time) by leaps
and bounds with increased tech level.

For example, here are the effective ranges of a 16m long, 2m bore,
256 Mj N-PAW (suitable for 100ton bays) at TL\'s 9-15:

Tech Lvl        Eff Range(km)          Improvement over previous TL

A few comments:

     1)  Still no editting being done.  Typos all through the product.

     2)  Only one noticable problem in the starship rules - the
"Subspace" rules give a method for computing "subspace velocity", but
doesn\'t bother to provide clues as to what units the velocity so
generated has.  Parsecs per day?  Parsecs per hour?  Furlongs per
fortnight?  Feet per Candle-Inch?

     3)  Who managed to hose up the small arms design rules?  I notice
after only a few minutes of study that the most accurate round for a
given barrel length is a large caliber pistol (straight case) round.
This does not match reality very well.  I also notice that the lower the
muzzle energy, the more inherently accurate the round is.  Very odd.

     4)  In the same section, I notice that the arbitrary barrel length
limits (0.2 to 2.3 times "average") preclude the design (within the
rules) of the Thompson submachine gun, the longer barrelled variants of
the Uzi and the Luger, the Ruger 0.44 caliber carbine, the M3
"greasegun", and almost all other WW2-era submachine guns.  And the
sawed-off shotgun, of course.

     5)  In the Gauss weapon section, I notice that the rule for
determining projectile mass produces reasonable numbers as long as the
caliber is 5mm or less.  By the time you get up to 20mm (the limits that
the rules apply to), you are firing something shaped rather like a
hockey-puck out of your gauss weapon.

     6)  No rules for something like a Gyrojet or the old 10mm ARL.
This can be fixed by using the rules for large rockets and scaling down,
if necessary, but this is really no more accurate than using the
artillery rules, scaled down, for handguns...

     7)  And finally, the example ACR in the back (which I notice is now
the "Generic" ACR for TNE) is not designed in accordance with the rules
presented in the small arms design sequence.  How come?  And does that
mean that the other new weapon stats provided in their little insert are
not designed properly either?  Do I detect a hint of "Shattered Ships"
in here?  Did the same guy do both sets of designs?


On to the good (or not so bad) things:

     1)  The maximum speed in atmosphere as a function of acceleration
has finally been fixed.  You no longer need to give your fighters 4+G\'s
to match the performance of an F-15 (1.25 G\'s).  On the other hand, the
new system would allow an F-16 (1.25 G\'s) to pull Mach 3.5 clean.
     Admittedly, I find erring in this direction slightly more appealing
than erring in the other direction, but would it have been too much to
ask to get something that comes close to the real world?

(minor related quibble)  Why can\'t any of the people who do "Vehicle
Design Rules" (GURPS, Trav in all incarnations) put a fudge factor in
dealing with the "sound barrier"?  In every one of these systems, there
is absolutely no problem with designing a vehicle that can ride right at
the speed of sound.  This does not match the real world all that well...

     2)  The fusion rocket STILL has performance much better than
reality.  But it no longer has an FTL exhaust, so it doesn\'t just blow
my suspension of disbelief away like it used to.  Looks like it will be
the drive of choice for warships, since it allows for a lot more delta-V
than the Heplar does, even with the larger size of the fusion rocket
taken into account.

     3)  I really like the addition of alternate "realistic" thrusters.
I\'ve already worked up a usable Bussard ramjet warship, which I MAY find
a use for someday.

     4)  Likewise the rest of the "alternate" technologies.

     5)  Cybernetics - these seem cribbed heavily from 2300AD, which
doesn\'t bother me at all.  The 2300AD rules were mostly pretty decent,
and the change from the 2300AD system to TNE system mostly makes the
cybernetics work better (I always thought that the stat-enhancing
cybernetics were pretty useless in 2300AD, since they mostly required
that you have a stat just below a breakpoint to get any meaningful
effect (other than the removal of some tens of thousands of credits from
the PCs)).

Nothing else really stands out one way or another.  Yet.  I\'ve only had
about three hours to look at it so far, and undoubtedly further study
will produce more commentary, which I probably will not bother to make
publicly...

Oh yeah!  The Heplar (insert caps where approriate - I don\'t remember
where they belong) drive description includes a pretty neat bit of
misdirection.  It states (more or less) that the exhaust is not
especially harmful because it isn\'t radioactive.  Well, that makes the
Heplar a REALLY HUGE PLASMA GUN, as opposed to the REALLY HUGE FUSION
GUN I originally thought it was.  It\'ll still trash a city quite
handily....

And now a word from Dave Nilsen:
   Re: Gravitic focussing of light

   Guy is correct in pointing out that the only reason for
   adding in the gravitic laser focussing is to allow Traveller
   to retain its long-range laser weapons and still be able to
   attach it to real-world optics. (I reasoned that this was a
   nice feature for players who would like to build their own
   TL-8 SDI programs so that they could get realistic results,
   rather than having the long-range fix embedded in the design
   sequence so that it was impossible to build realistic TL-8
   SDI lasers.)

   Gravitic focussing is nothing more or less than a fudge
   factor, and we have called it as much. However, reasoning
   that players would rather have a science fiction
   rationalization for it, I called it gravitic focussing
   because the manipulation of gravitic and pseudo-gravitic
   effects is a common crutch in science fiction and Traveller,
   notwithstanding the fact that it is nonsense. Artificial
   gravity and anti-gravity appeared at about the same tech
   level that we required long-range lasers, so it was natural
   to consider this as another application of the technology
   that is embedded in just about everything else in Traveller.

   James Kundert correctly points out that breakthroughs in
   one area will be embedded in other technologies so that we
   can assume that whatever makes the lasers really good also
   makes the HEPlaR (not to mention EAPlaC, has anybody seen
   how phenomenally good that stuff is?) really good, along
   with your TL toasters and hair driers.

   However, the fact that the fudge factor is called one form
   of nonsense rather than another form of nonsense (if anyone
   invents real anti-gravity or reactionless thruster plates in
   my lifetime, I owe you all a dollar) seems to be bending
   some people\'s noses out of joint.

   I have a solution. Don\'t call it gravitic focussing, call
   it fairy dust.

   Do you believe in Tinkerbell? There isn\'t an Emperor
   Strephon either, and there never will be. Fortunately,
   having fun with Traveller doesn\'t require us to believe that
   that is exactly what the future will look like, because

  A) It won\'t, and

      B) ain\'t none of us gonna be around to find out anyway.

      This is supposed to be fun, not Nostradamus.

  As I recall, the Broadsword gained 10% in volume (from 800 to 880
tons) in official print (granted, it was broken), and the Kinunir
was _never_ well converted because several of its systems never had
hard numbers.  The one attempt in Challenge to convert the Kinunir
did so by taking the High Guard stats literally.  Never mind the
Drop tubes and the AI computer.
  As for converted ships keeping their characteristics from CT to MT,
I can give only qualified agreement.  The addition of power
requirements for all things resulted in ships nearly always loosing
their high Maneuver engines.  Until the concept of variable-load
powerplants was hit upon (at roughly the same time here and on GEnie:
variable load here and "booster plants" there), and the exclusion of
life-support from fuel tankage, MT ships could not measure up to CT
and HG ships.

 >Other missing things that carried over from CT to MT but not to TNE are:
 >Effectively unlimited ship movement

  There are several solutions to this.  If you assume that outer
systems are still settled as heavily as Scouts/World Builder\'s made
them, it\'s a short hop to using in-system jumps to get around.  With a
gas station on every moon, this isn\'t a real problem.
  Second:  FF&S _does_ include the Thruster Plate option.  No reaction
mass to worry about, lots of range (especially with powerplants using
fuel by the year instead of by the month).  Just like old times.
  Third:  take more time.  A Hard Times game I ran brought up the
question of in-system trip times.  Even under constant thrust, the
Armored Gig (Gazelle model) that was the group\'s first spacecraft
took a fair number of days to travel from orbit 5.5 in to orbit 1.
Megatraveller was not nearly as fast-thrusting as you might think.
  Fourth:  Assume that TNE HEPlaR drives have a gravitically dependant
Stutterwarp equivalent built in (so no third drive, and no more
engineers) that allows much higher speeds in the zone between the
Primary\'s 100 and 1000 diameter limits.  The drive _requires_ some
local gravity to work, so can\'t be used for star-to-star travel.
This opens up the outer system for a fraction of the hydrogen.

 >Crew Sizes (they increased slightly with MT, but doubled with TNE)

  The "private/commercial/military" post from yesterday, or the HAIS
post (also yesterday) will handle this nicely.

 >How Nuclear Dampeners work

  How often do you use these?
  Actually, they just got better explained.  They did not change
appreciably.  Dig out Striker and read the section on Dampers.  MT
never bothered to tell us that Dampers required surface exposure,
probably because they assumed that dampers were "matter-transparent"
technology.  GDW says no, they require an antenna, so we now mount
them in turret cans. With the hardpoint limit gone, this is a non-issue.

 >Anti-Grav devices providing thrust

  To nit-pick, the new Contra-grav does provide the equivalent of
thrust by taking care of the craft\'s weight.  MegaT\'s Anti-grav
had to be purchased above and beyond the craft\'s mass before it
would work.  If you take the Thruster Plate option, your tanks
will still fly on Anti-grav.

 >Duplicating CT ship designs was easy in MT: nothing "disappeared".

  I will agree that mixed turrets (not just _multiple_ turrets, but
mixed ones) were annoying to lose

  This one at least won\'t be a problem:  the Kinunir has a page
in Brilliant Lances.

  The high energy weapons are _very_ short-ranged from the space
combat point of view.  PAWs are in FF&S, but I haven\'t played with
the numbers to see if the old PA barbette is doable.  With Laser
barbettes reaching to maximum combat ranges for a measly few
megawatts, I can happily leave PAs in the spinal mount and in bays.

 >...I can not fit my Kinunir reasonably into the TNE

  This is my biggest conversion complaint.  All-cargo ships are
very difficult to build so they are worthwhile.  The cargo capacity
of the Type R in the TNE book is not (very far) off, and is only
about half of what it used to be.  Starship economics are considerably
bleaker than before because of this.

mgood@mit.edu had this to say:

:A few comments on Jerry\'s recent post to th TML:
:
:Jerry (darkstar@bach.udel.edu) sez:
:
:> First off all, to the guy who was upset that MegaTraveller doesn\'t
:> transfer well into TNE terms.
:
:The polite thing to do is to copy what the other fellow said.  This
:allows: 1) other people to see what they said and 2) prevents you from
:misquoting them.

You\'re absolutely right.  I was too lazy to go back and quote from the
article.  And look at all of the problems that it caused.  After all,
you\'re not even the guy I was talking about/to.

[tirade about cross-compatible designs deleted]

:You suggested that:
:> Pick up a copy of Survival Margin.  It\'s purpose is to provide a
:> bridge between the two games.  Now, this is only in respect to
:> characters.  It tells you how to convert MT characters into TNE
:> characters
:You answered yourself there :-)  But I do have a copy of Survival Margin.

Gee, well then I guess that if you have a copy of it, then you know
what\'s it\'s used for.  I was talking about converting EVERY aspect of MT
to TNE.  And who would\'ve thought that characters actually are part of
the game.

:Then you said:
:> As for vehicles, I\'m afraid that you\'ll have to convert them all by
:> hand by recreating them using the FF&S rules.
:Right so far...
:>Now, you said that ships transferred okay between Classic and MT, but
:>that these designs are too radically different to be easily converted
:>to TNE rules.  That\'s a bunch of BS!  The ship design rules between CT
:>and MT were radically different.
:Hmmm... I know I THINK this, but I couldn\'t find where I posted this
:on this list, so I\'m not sure if I\'m being misquoted or not ;-)
:Right, the RULES were different, but the results were largely the same:
:everything still fit on the hull, so Kinunir and Broadsword conversions
:left the ships with the same characteristics.  Under TNE, things like
:triple turrets and particle accelerator barbettes are gone, so if your
:ship had them in CT and MT, how do you explain to your players that
:they don\'t exist in TNE?
:Other missing things that carried over from CT to MT but not to TNE are:
:Effectively unlimited ship movement
:Crew Sizes (they increased slightly with MT, but doubled with TNE)
:How Nuclear Dampeners work
:Anti-Grav devices providing thrust
:etc.etc.  Duplicating CT ship designs was easy in MT: nothing "disappeared".
:This isn\'t the case with TNE.

Okay, well first of all, let\'s look at what Survival Margin and the TNE
rulebook said (after all, if you have it, then you must have read it).
Computers were redesigned to deal with, and be more resilient to Virus.
Both books said that the computers became less centralized, and now had
more stations and checkpoints.  Gee, I wonder if that could be why you
now need more people to crew a specific station?

In FF&S, reactionless thrust has been put back in.  Use it, I know I do.

:Anyway, I\'m recapping this stuff because you\'re new to the list.  Most of the
:other people on this list are bored to tears/sleep/death by this topic.
:You go on to say:
:>Ships in MT (and their creation rules) weren\'t compatible with High
:>Guard and Trillion Credit Squadron.  All of the CT ships had to be
:>completely reworkedto fit into MT.
:Not really, see above.  Redesigned, yes.  Re-explained, no.
:> Thats just the way it works.  With each of these revisions, they\'ve
:> found a few more holes to plug, and a few more bugs to spray.
:Nah.  They majorly changed the game.
:> But, in MT\'s defense I have grown accustommed to reactionless
:> drives and multiple weapon turrets.  It\'s a good thing that they put
:> at least one of these back in FF&S (I can live with single weapon
:> turrets).

Oh please, in High Guard/Trillion Credit Squadron, I could design a ship
that had lots of G\'s, big guns, jump-100, etc, and fit it into 100 tons
of hull!  Geez, and then when MT came around, you couldn\'t do that
anymore.  Now, you actually had to think about maximizing your space,
and doing some other things.  Granted, most CT designs could transfer
with the only big losses being losing some maneuver G\'s, and cargo
space, but the entire concept behind ship design still changed.

:You conclude:
:
:>As for the rules of play, well, they\'re different enough that you need
:>to learn them, but not different enough that they don\'t "feel" similar
:>to the old rules.
:
:Except that combat isn\'t as dangerous, you run out of fuel in
:space combat, in system transit times are alot slowers, blah blah blah.

So, are you upset because it\'s not as easy for you to off someone, or
because it\'s not as easy for your character to take the big dirt nap?
Fuel in space combat?  Hmm, well, it seems more realistic.  Yeah, it
takes some getting used to, I guess you\'ve actually made a good point.
If you don\'t like the new in system transit times, then use the old
ones.  Who knows, new ship rules, new transit times?

:I _LIKE_ TNE, but I\'m trying to convert an existing campaign. Had they
:retained alot of the building blocks of CT and MT, they would have alienated
:fewer long time players and made conversion MUCH easier.
:So in the future, if you\'re going to flame at someone, PLEASE use basic
:courtesy and quote them, OK?  We\'ll all be better internetters for it.
:Of course, I\'m only assuming you were flaming at me ;-)

Well, obviously this proves the old adage "when you assume, you make and
ass out of you and me".  Listen, my previous post wasn\'t directed
towards you.  I\'m sorry if you took it the wrong way.  You\'ve got a
pretty thin skin if you considered my response flaming.  Now this
response was a flame (I tend to actually be sarcastic when I\'m flaming).

Thank you for welcoming me to the list in your very special manner...

Comments: The Mobile Command Center is used by government agencies and
large companies when a mobile, self-contained base is needed. The large
cargo bay can carry a variety of equipment, allowing the Mobile Command
Center to carry out a variety of specialized missions.

The flexibility of the Mobile Command Center has led to its use in a wide
variety of different roles. For example, MCCs were used by Division
commanders during the Topas Annexation of 5627, by Randall Industries for
prospecting on the colony worlds of the Schlesien Belt, and by the
NeuBerlin Metro Police Force\'s infamous Advanced Police Department in
various crisis situations.

Like I said in a previous message, I\'ve been playing with Striker and
High-Guard recently.  My current direction has been toward a highly
maneuverable, very flexible, highly effective strike battalion.  Other missions
would not be turned down, though...  :)

Before posting the whole thing (quite long), and since I haven\'t hammered out
_all_ of the details to my satisfaction yet, I thought I\'d post a "feeler" to
see if there was any interest.

My basic concept of the unit centers around the availability of TL 12-13+
equipment, but quite a bit of it can be made to work at TL 9+ (and I will
include the various modifications for variant TLs.)

The driving force behind all of this was to provide a background for an SF
novel, but I thought that others might be interested as well.  (Did you ever
wonder how disruptive an elite force of hi-tech warriors could be in a given
operation?  Did you ever wonder how much (little) it would cost?  Now\'s your
chance!)

Star Trek Starship Combat Simulator, Star Fleet Battles, etc. If they have to
do a little song-and-dance with physics to get the lasers to work, let \'em.
The game is FUN, that\'s all that matters, right?

I bought this under the misguided impression that it would have the
second printing of the rulebook (for some reason that was my impression
based on past discussion on this list).  I\'m sending this message
incase anyone else on here made the same assumption I did.. the rulebook
in teh Deluxe box is the SAME existing 1.0 edition.

There are 2 books and 1 booklet in the deluxe box:  TNE rules, FF&S, and
an "upgrade" booklet that covers changes to the main rules that have
been made by the creation of FF&S.  It says that "updated rule books
will have the designation version 1 mod 1, dec 1993 on the title page".

So, now i have two copies of the TNE mod1 rulebook.. anyone want to buy one?

as the S.A.S.A. would they effectively give you a laser with the same
dish diameter as the S.A.S.A.?  In other words can the nine laser turrets
function in concert forming a "Big Dish" Laser for long distance target
engagement?

On another tangent.  Is it possible that the hivers have recovered from

what they did to the K\'kree?

On another subject;

Whatever happened to Steve Higginbotham\'s TCS campaign?

If it\'s over with or otherwise finished, I\'d be greatly
interested in a "historical" account.

I\'d also be very interested in seeing some of the ship designs.

    'body' => 'Hello there:

	 In the midst of sorting my thoughts out about the Computer Thingy, I have
come to a question that I have been skirting around for a while. In the case of
future Tech Level advancements on technology, how should I deal with the
miniaturization issue? For certain, we have seen advances in our lifetimes of
epic proportions in computer hardware and even common domestic equipment. I
Just received a Discman CD player for Christmas, that has even more features
than my previous CD player (Which was the size of your typical stereo
component) and is the size of two and a half CD cases stacked on top of one
another... Quite a reduction in size, and we haven\'t even advanced a Tech
Level!! ;->

	 So I have been thinking if maybe we should have a formula for this. One of
the more sensible formulae that I have come up with over christmas has been
this ...

                           Introduction Tech Level Attribute Value
Modified Attribute Value = ----
                               (Current Tech Level - Introduction Tech Level)
							 10

     This seems to work in one instance I can cite - the infamous TL 11 Hand
computer. It says that it has a volume of 0.2 litres. Cool. Now, taking into
account the modifications expressed in the Starship Computer Tables in the
Referee\'s Manual, we have a value of 200 kl at TL 5 (or 200,000 litres) and
a weight of 50 t at TL 5 (or 50,000 kg). Now, applying the formula, we come
up with:

              200,000 l      200,000 l
	  0.2 l = ----   = ----
				(11 - 5)          6
              10                10

               50,000 kg     50,000 kg
	 0.05 kg = ----  = ----
                 (11 - 5)          6
               10                10


     Now, there is a whoops there. The mass is supposed to be 0.5 kg, not 0.05.
However, this could be due to the resident battery pack, which is by far the
most heavy piece of the device. As for the pricing of the computer, I don\'t
have a contingency as of yet. Now, The rule seems pretty reasonable to me for
physical aspects of equipment, but I\'d like to know what you all think of it.

	 This would yield advances in the size of Robot Brain components also. The
idea that Linear CPU\'s, for instance, do not change in size from one tech level
to another is simply ludicrous! The Linear CPU and Storage Module would have
the following stats at TL 11:

Type           Vol (litres)  Wt. (kg)  Price (Cr)  TL
- ----
Linear CPU       0.0002       0.0001    0.5        11
Storage          0.0005       0.0001    0.25       11


	 This, in keeping with the idea that the robot rules should meld with the
computer rules, makes it possible to construct a Hand Held Tl 11 Mod/1 computer
with the proper number of CPU modules and Storage modules. In fact, this brings
the question forward of what are the module requirements for each of the
models of computers. I haven\'t bothered with the idea of how much memory should
reside in a Storage module as of yet. The various real world/Traveller Computer
correspondences are necessary, and I will have to do some research on the
various "most advanced computers" of the times. Don\'t ask me about the Control
Points thing... 8-(

     I eventually want to be able to extend these rules to the handling of
hardware add-ons. I kinda like the idea of actual computer construction rules.
I\'m working in that direction.

	 Anyone want to comment?

Once upon a time, before the sinking of F.G.U. and the rise of Star Wars
licensed products, there was a game called Traveller. It came in three small
booklets and it was good. But with the waning of the years of innocence GDW did
look upon the face of their sales, and lo, begat Mega Traveller of Many
Colours, and did fill it with many fine and strangely crafted rules. But yeah
the people of the Imperium did look upon the new creation wrought in the image
of the three books and lo saw that it was flawed. Listening to the torment of
the multitiude GDW did release errata sheets; and they were legion. And the
people did name the Many Coloured One "Typo Traveller" and were filled with
dismay.

With the passing of the age of Innocence came \'The New Era\', and there was many
wiping of slates clean. And lo the sides of the die did multiply thricefold and
more, the Imperium was swept away, and the people did weep. Yet from within the
lamentation the people did look upon the new book and did like the new
uncluttered task system and rejoiced over character generation. And yeah they
threw down their laser carbines for they were as nought in the face of the
enemy, and picked up rifled muskets for they had better penetration at small
range than the ACR with DS rounds.

And yet in this moment of triumph \'Errata\', the Evil One, did once more spoil
the party with seditious mistakes and inconsistencies.

And it is Now, and I that speak to you from the far distant land of England. A
land that has not yet seen the light of FF&S or indeed this:

 U> From: gt6963c@prism.gatech.edu

 U> There are 2 books and 1 booklet in the deluxe box:  TNE rules, FF&S, adn

With confusion and a sadly dwindeling bank account, I seek T:TNE Errata to fill
the holes in our blessed book. Sages of the TML, answer me:

   What errata is currently available?
   Where may such wise lore be found?
   Does this involve more than changes to system travel times?
   Will GDW slay Errata for good with version 1 mod 1?

I can only watch and hope.

Range and Performance

Cargo: 	1551.008 m^3 (110.78 tons standard), 244.608 m^3 more than Type R.
	This is 17.5 tons standard *more* than the FF&S Type R.

Range:	2 Parsec, 15.5 G-Hours, and 1 standard year
	1 Parsec, 23.5 G-Hours, and 1 standard year
	In-System 32.0 G-Hours, and 1 standard year

Mods:	A maximum-cargo model (classified as Type R21) is available as a
	special-order from several shipyards.  Using the higher efficency of
	the J-2 drives, this version increases the available cargo space.  A
	total of 529.445 m^3 of fuel tankage is converted to cargo space,
	and the maximum performace becomes 1 parsec and 15 G-Hours.  Since
	this modification retains the R2\'s drives, 75-ton drop tanks can
	still be carried at no performance or cargo penalty.  This increases
	the total cargo to 2080.453 m^2 (148.6 tons).

Comment about merchant operations: From a quick perusal of the relevant
rules in T:TNE, it appears that successful operations to and from a world\'s
surface can be carried out on about 2 G-Hours of fuel (1 G-Hour each way).
If we assume that a reasonable allowance for stellar and planetary orbital
motion is 2d6 G-Turns (2d6/2 G-Hours), then the 7.5 G-Hour fuel allowance
for the J5 crossing is tight but doable.  Performed as 2xJ2 and 1xJ1, such a
crossing would be time-consuming when compared to a J-3 or J-5 ship, but not
at least full cargo capacity is retained.  For more routine operations, a 12
to 15 G-Hour maneuver reserve was assumed to be standard procedure.

The basic formula seems to work quite nicely, with a problem from the
published rules - the computers don\'t decrease in size consistently through
the TL\'s, and are assumed to include \'synaptic processing\'. When I created
the rules for the laptop and desktop comp\'s for my game, I just incremented
the TL and based the sizes, prices, etc off the published equivilants. For
example, the desktop/laptop models are 2 TL\'s behind the \'standard\' comps
and the handheld\'s are 4 TL\'s behind the \'standard\'s. I made some allowances
for \'flight\' versions of desktops - which essentially become laptops.

Anthony, I think you\'re really shooting yourself in the head trying to keep
the Traveller computers close to Real-World (tm) values. This is something
that\'s been \'broken\' for a long time, and they\'ve not gone back and
re-worked it to match. The component pieces for robots, etc are great - but
as soon as you try to match it to real-world data, you\'re going to have more
agruments than ever over \'how things work\'. To give an example - Scott 2G
Kellogg had come up with some comments a while about about thin-film diamond
processing and the possible effects it might have on computer technology. It
was really something! (Although I don\'t remember all the details).

I\'m not saying \'don\'t develop the components\' rules, but rather just don\'t
match them too closely to the real-world. Even Book 8 didn\'t try to match
them all up, and simply relied on a table of \'skill X requires 3 storage
points\' per level of skill.

BTW - I like the component conversions!

There are some definite problems with layout, but I don\'t think that \'typos
all through the product\' is an accurate description. The largest problem I
had with the book was some formulas are clearly stated and some are embedded
into the text. It can make things very difficult sometimes. :)

A little bit of errata that Susan posting somewhere had the V representing
parsec\'s per hour. I understand she\'s working on a subspace ship just to see
how it works out. There\'s also errata concerning the multiplication for ship
combat. The reference in the same section to x200 should be x50.

Could you post your obvious errors? Derek Wildstar and the GDW-beta kinda
folks actually posted some designs that came out -very- close to the real
thing. Although I\'d defer to him, I think his biggest complaint was that the
weapons came out heavy when you got into the high-power range. If you\'ve
come up with more obvious errors, I\'d like to see them - maybe work up some
fix.

I believe that\'s perfectly reasonable. The Gauss weapons in CT and MT where

Unfortunate, but true. Derek Wildstar and John Bogan both made some yelping

Isn\'t this supposed to be part of the \'good things\' list? They say straight

rockets don\'t match reality, and that if you\'re interested in being a
reality bug, stick to the ramjets & rockets.

Yet another bit of oddness. I don\'t know why they went to HEPLaR as opposed
to gravitics - but the TL15 grav vehicles are using them for thrust in the
atmosphere. Yep - a plasma gun it is, but If you think of it, this has been
been an aspect of SF for a long, long time - as well as beaten to death on
this list the same amount of time. :)

Greetings all, found something interesting here.

Tomorrow morning I start graduate classes in MEdical Physics, so, I
was starting to peruse the books.  Radiation Biology.  (neat stuff)
The first few pages included one particular fact that has kinda blown
my mind in regard to Traveller.

LD50 (a dose of radiation that will be fatal to 50% of a population)
is 4 Gray, that is, four joules of radiation per kilo.  My text goes
on to say that the equivalent energy of this in heat is 67 calories.
(Not the diet Kilocalories, but calories)  Which is about the amount
of heat your body would pick up from a sip of hot coffee.

Now, consider our X-ray lasers.  I know in TNE the lasers are no longer
x-ray lasers, but lets think about them anyway.  Ok, now these lasers
do their damage primarily by hitting the target and causing severe burns
through heat.  (Flash heating tissue to steam, vaporizing bone... etc)

Ok, now if the heat of one sip of coffee is the deadly mark, imagine
how much energy is in the x-ray beam that can cause the kind of damage
we are supposed to expect of an x-ray laser rifle.  I\'d imagine it
would be many thousands of times LD50.

No wonder GDW got rid of hand held x-ray lasers!

But we still have the detonation x-ray lasers.  Well, with such a piddling
amount of energy being deadly, and the det-lasers ability to chew through
coherant superdense armor, consider what it could do to the humble human
frame.  By my guess, the X-ray laser should cause some SEVERE radiation
casualties.  Perhaps we better go back to the Imperial "No Nukes" laws.

As to particle accelerators...  If only a TINY amount of radiation leaks
through your hull armor.  Boy are you dead in one big hurry.

I think that one of the basic assumptions in a lot of Trav\'s technology
is something along the lines that objects remain about the same size, but
their capabilities increase with advancing tech level.

Why?  Well, a TL 15 hand computer with the same capabilities COULD Be made
as a bulkier TL 11 hand computer.  And indeed it could be made a lot smaller.
But one thing that won\'t change is the hand that operates it.  The person
using the TL 15 computer still needs it to be big enough so he can hit the
keys (or jack in or whatever)  Basically, things have an optimal size.
As you go higher in tech you still have to retain that size, but you can
pack MORE capabilities in there.

Of course this only holds for hand held technology really.  But if you
look at other Traveller technology, it holds out across the board.  No one
wants to worry about items that take up a lot less volume than a single
liter.  (.001 M^3)  Anything smaller than that might prove a pain to
replace.  (Imagine fitting your hand under the hood of a Japanese car to
get at the oil filter and you get the picture)

I remember something similar coming up with Bertil\'s hand gun designs.
Ordinarily, you needed a certain weight of hand gun to keep recoil
under control.  He found that at TL 14-15, the superdense barrel and
trigger mechanisms of his gun weighed in at less than the optimal weight.
Solution?  He put lead in the handles to make it weigh more!

Ah!  But you\'re forgetting something!  If you build one brain at TL11,
and another brain at TL 12 using identical components, the TL 12 brain
will get a +1 to its apparant intelligence that the TL 11 brain won\'t
have.

As to storage medium, you are right!  The \'standard\' storage components and
\'synaptic\' too remain the same capacity and so forth all across tech levels.
10 storage units will have an education of 1 no matter what TL you\'re at.

>...Quite a reduction in size, and we haven\'t even advanced a Tech level!!
	(talking about CD players in specific, and computer and electronic
technology in general)

	Well, to get picky, you CD player analogy is off a bit...if you
look inside a tabletop CD player, most of it is either empty space, or
power supply.  The actual electronics and mechanism are generally much
closer in size to your Discman.  Of course, Sony has made a long corporate
history of miniturizing things.

	However, some of the stuff can\'t go down.  Recall, for instance
your "Infamous"  model hand computer, that at Tl11 is 0.5 kg, vs 50,000
at Tl5. Much of the weight is in things that cannot be reduced, like
keyboards, and readable screens, or at least touchpad areas large enough
to be useable. This limit has already been reached in our day and age...we
can make computers that\'ll fit in a matchbook (AMD has a complete "XT on a
chip"- all you add is memory and a battery, and the various connectors)
The problem, as many companies have found when marketing them, is that
humans have not miniturized well enough to keep pace, our fingers are
still those comparatively pudgy things that get in each other\'s way when
typing on a small keyboard (or like mine...when typing on a normal
keyboard ;-).  So size will not continue to go down...I suspect that in
truth, size will hit a certain plateau, while function continues to go up.

	Besides, a 100 mg robot brain (a true peabrain!!) is pretty
ludicrous...the miniturization required there pushes stuff way beyond
physical limits.  At that complexity/size ratio, you can\'t use electrons;
they\'ll just tunnel around rather than stay in their appointed circuits.
Photons would have similar problems. And biology, well, biology does
pretty well at brains that size, but I\'d be scared to let something with
the brainpower of a pigeon control anything!

	Maybe I hit upon the answer earlier...use something like a
complexity/size ratio rather than size alone.

	Of course if Cadillacs followed the same technology/pricing that
computers have, they\'d cost about $0.05 apiece (in quantity, more on
carriers for suitable surface mounting :), and be 1/4" in size!

Subject: Technology & incremental improvements


    TNE provides an reasonable list of technology levels and equipment
    available; with size and cost, etc

    However, once you have technology X it is assumed to be static in
    characteristics until the next technology jump (to Y) occurs.

    TNE doesn\'t show it but I believe there should be scope in the game
    for incremental improvements.  These improvements (or MARK numbers)
    may infact improve a tech level X object (to MARK 22 say) that actually
    outperforms a tech level X+1 object (at MARK 1).  Of course the cost
    of the incremental improvements would eventually become more than the
    cost of the X+1 technology.  You could take a tech level to MARK 99
    but at some point it becomes more cost effective to take the tech
    level rise ... always assuming you know how to upgrade to the next
    tech level.  It is usually cheaper to retool a factory to build the
    next MARK level rather than retool for the next tech level.  Imagine
    running into a society thats been stuck at tech level 10 for 100\'s of
    years but have refined their weapons to be as effective as tech level
    12 or 13.

    How effective the MARK increments are would need to be determined
    and how many MARK levels are technically possible for an item for a
    tech level would need to be set.  You might want to allow for
    10 MARK increments between tech levels so a tech X MARK 10 would
    perform like a tech X+1 MARK 1; and allow for 1 to 25 MARKs as the
    maximum range developable.  A tech X MARK 21 item may be enormous
    and expensive and look nothing like a tech X+1 MARK 1 item but it
    could do the same function.

    The MARK levels would allow for different vendors to push the
    advantages of their new releases etc.

    The only example of this that comes to mind is how the Russians
    continued refining and using valves rather than switching to
    transisitors (and silicon?) as quickly as the USA.  I\'m not big
    on electronics so I\'m not sure if this is a good example but it
    was something that came up a while ago in a tech talk with friends.

    I assume that FF&S don\'t have anything like MARK increments within
    tech levels?

    I haven\'t done any vehicle/item building but from looking at the
    small arms and weapons there doesn\'t seem to be much scope for
    variation.  However, the recent computer discussion might want to
    consider incremental computer improvements to account for size and
    function variations.  The example of the DiscMan CD player being as
    function rich as the stereo version might be explained this way.

    Comments?

Design notes:  The laser sight is on the FF&S version for two reasons.  One
is to have the targeting advantage.  The other is the added weight.  With
out it, Recoil jumps to 3.
The FF&S version is twice the weight, but carries 5 more rounds, has a
recoil of 2, rather than 3.  It does the same damage with a slightly better
range.  The combination of Laser sight, lower recoil and larger magazine
allow for more accurate substained fire.

    'body' => 'A known phenomenon in the various incarnations of Traveller is that high-
technology goods often increase vastly in cost with each TL rise while income
does not. This leads to peculiar artifacts of the system such as in High Guard
TL15 starships are so expensive that not enough of them can be bought to
overcome greater numbers of lower TL designs of equal cost (I think I remember
this referred to). Also in many cases the utility of the high-tech device does
not justify the cost. The extreme here is the TNE plasma rifle, which requires
ammunition, is short-ranged, guaranteed to give away the firer\'s position, and
in general inferior to an auto-grenade launcher, which happens to be much
cheaper ( The old main advantage of the man-portable fusion/plasma guns was that
apart from the prototype they had infinite ammunition, and that is now no
longer the case).

There is a case to be made that high tech-level civilizations should be very
rich compared to lower TL ones, apart from any details of exchange rates. In
this case the high costs are affordable and the equipment is seen as being the
minimum standard (while lower-tech equipment is seen as cheap, shoddy and of
course old-fashioned.) Massive automation and computerisation at all levels
would make the average TL15 individual richer than the richest TL8 individual
in terms of comfort and lifestyle(much as the average TL8 individual is better
off than the richest TL3/4 one). The income of people with equivalent jobs
would increase significantly at each TL.

This is not a traditional Traveller idea, and it would change the old Imperium
background in interesting ways (this is not hugely relevant to TNE except in
the Regency and the most advanced of the pocket empires). If high-tech planets
are comfortable and rich their inhabitants will not want to leave them for
barbarian(as they see them) planets, as they would have too much to
lose(extended lifespans amongst them). High-tech cultures will probably have
zero population growth, which makes colonisation difficult. Also, colonists
have historically been those with little or nothing to lose, such as the poor,
refugees, and dissidents; adventuring types have been a very small fraction.
High-tech planets would use resources prolifigately, even assuming recycling,
and would probably have to import raw materials from other systems. These raw
materials would come from poorer worlds who would probably not be paid much for
them. This could produce a rich country-poor country divide, much as is
becoming visible in the Northern/Southern hemisphere divide today.

I can see it now, stolid TL8 barbarians fighting against the effete high-tech
invaders who are attempting to replace the legitimate government with a puppet
regime, so that they can siphon off the planet\'s valuable natural resources at
way under a fair price. Thanks to TNE they have the benefit of superior TL8
weaponry over the invaders ineffective laser weapons and plasma rifles. Down
with the evil RCES........  oops, sorry, got carried away there :-)

Hi, my name is Roger Sanger.

I love this "mailing list" concept.  Pen pals galore.  More Travellers to
ramble to!

I\'ve been playing Traveller and several other RPG\'s on and off for the past
12 years.

Of all of the approaches to running a campaign, I\'ve found the following to
be the most enjoyable and least frustrating:

Simply wait until a campaign is fully developed (or at least extensively
developed) by the publishers before you start running it.  That is, I
purchase each "module" as they come out, but don\'t start reffing a
particular campaign until there is sufficient background material.

A slant on this approach is to collect the entirety of a (large) campaign /
game system which has already run its course.

The pros and cons (as they occur to me):

Con:  Waiting can be hard for the impatient.
Pro:  Less development work for the ref.
Pro:  You don\'t have to worry as much about published materials obsoleting
      your custom changes to the campaign.
Con:  Your "investment" lies dormant.
Con:  Expensive if you try to collect everything at once.
Con:  Many veteran Traveller players have already run through the
      older adventures.
Pro:  There are lots of role-players unfamiliar with Traveller

This approach occurred to me when running TSR\'s World of Greyhawk (fantasy
setting).  I couldn\'t use much of the published material because I had by
necessity already developed much of the Flanaess -- I pretty much allow the
players to go wherever they want, and try to stay ahead of them whatever
direction they choose to head off in.  Running Greyhawk was frustrating,
especially when the City of Greyhawk and the Council of Eight (Tenser,
Mordenkainen, Bigby, Otiluke, etc.) were finally described, because they
were nothing like their namesakes in my campaign.  Also, waiting for the
Temple of Elemental Evil to finally come out put a major crimp on the
development of the related regions, especially since I had already run the
Village of Hommlet.  Now that Greyhawk is extensively developed, it
wouldn\'t be a bad campaign to start up (assuming you could find its now
out-of-print supplements and modules).

I was having the same difficulties in my (Traveller) Spinward Marches
campaign, but on a much larger scale.  Much of the material conflicted with
my custom developments and either had to be discarded or extensively
modified (especially world descriptions and rumors referring to worlds).
Also, it seemed like the material being produced for the game became
available in a mere trickle.

Eventually, for entirely unrelated reasons (reality impeding with its
demands upon my time), I put Traveller aside, and shifted my participation
in RPG\'s to being a player rather than a ref.  Eventually, this led to a
serendipitous discovery.

Eight years went by...

Recently (about 15 months ago), I started getting involved in Traveller
again.  I began by collecting as much material relating to Traveller as I
possibly could (my collection has just passed the 350-item mark).  Then,
about 6 months ago, after I had collected almost everything pertaining to
the Spinward Marches that was ever printed, I started a classic Traveller
campaign.

I\'ve found this approach to offer a wider range of gaming options, due to
the wider selection of support material that has accumulated over the
years.  A large collection gives you many more options available
at-your-fingertips.  Many more than a fledgling game, for instance.

I started the campaign in the year 1100 Imperial (the very beginning of the
Classic era of the Traveller time line), and have been having a blast
running the various original Traveller adventures (though I use the newer
rules sets, from MegaTraveller and Traveller: New Era).  I have found much
of the background material developed in MegaTraveller (Rebellion era and
Hard Times era) and even much of the material in the New Era products to be
fully applicable to the "classic" era (the time frame of the adventures The
Kinunir, Twilight\'s Peak, Secret of the Ancients, The Traveller Adventure,
the adventures in DGP\'s Traveller Digest, etc.), simply because most
Traveller material (whatever-the-era) is written from an historical
approach about things that existed in or prior to the classic era (1100 to
1115).

Most equipment, ship designs, technology explanations, aliens, world
backgrounds, and much material on the inner-workings of the Imperial
bureaucracy and its various agencies, even though written for Meg or NewE
is quite applicable to classic Traveller settings.

I now have so much material to choose from (including literally hundreds of
adventures), that I\'ve tried a new approach I call the "player survey."  It
consists of a set of questions via which the player(s) decide what kind of
scenario and in which kind of setting they would like to game.  I then go
through my collection, find the closest match (or design one), and about 2
to 3 weeks later, run them through it -- most of the time, I can find a
fairly close match.  As I get more of the collection read, I\'ll be able to
do this on-the-spot.  This process generally takes place simultaneously to
whatever other scenarios are currently being run (I spring the questionaire
on the hapless players during breaks, between sessions, etc.).

==========================================================================

Well, there you have it.

Caution:  The above survey can cause you a lot of work if you don\'t have a
large collection to draw upon (because you\'ll have to design adventures to
fit), or if you haven\'t read your collection.

Note that the interpretation of several of the scales can overlap or even
contradict each other, depending on the answers chosen.  Thus, another reason
for the emphasis on finding the "closest match."

I\'ve found the survey method of scenario selection to trigger thought about
adventure scenarios in much the same way the UPP (Universal Planetary Profile)
triggers ideas on the make-up of a world.

The use of the survey in my campaign has had some interesting results:

- ----
One player, who chose an "insane, exotic, heavily alien (9),
starship-based, start-in-the-action" scenario, wound up as the human
captain (of Solomani descent) of a ship with a crew of aliens and
minor-race-humans, and an even more bizarre passenger list, with a few
rather exotic pets thrown in.  (The aliens on-board consisted of a potpouri
of published "official" aliens, of both major and minor races, from the
vast array of Traveller products written over the years, along with a dozen
or more aliens of my own design).

The cargo consisted of exotic foods, medical supplies (including drugs),
anagathics, and some weird zoological specimens.  Placed in the Far
Frontiers Sector (two sectors spinward of the Spinward Marches, and thus
out of familiar territory for the player), the ship had just misjumped into
deep space (an empty hex), and had completely short-circuited its
jump-field-grid, yet it had enough fuel for a long sublight journey.  It
would take 130+ years to get back to civilized space, or more depending
upon the duration and degree of acceleration chosen.

The player\'s character was very old chronologically speaking (102),
and so had already maxed-out on anagathics.  Since he was growing an extra
thumb as a side-effect of his anagathics use, he had to decide between
either dying in deep space (he obviously didn\'t have that many years left
to live), or go into cold sleep.  He was also faced with the dilemma of
saving the rest of the sophonts on board, and had to (while avoiding a
potential mutiny) determine who got to go into cold sleep, who had to take
anagathics (assuming he broke into the cargo), who had to go into
hybernation (with medical "fast" drugs), and who had to live through it on
meager rations.

To make matters much much worse, there were many idiosyncracies within the
crew members and passengers.  One of the sophonts was a photosynth (i.e.,
he needed light for energy), which had to be taken into account when
considering the conservation of the ship\'s fuel and use of emergency
lighting.  There were couples or "mated-for-life-pairs" onboard who didn\'t
want to be seperated, and a passenger who had a symbiotic relationship with
his pet (i.e., he didn\'t want it sacrificed for food).  There was
bickering/fighting over supplies and equipment, the use of luggage, etc.
And the details went on-and-on.

While taking into account the language-barriers, the cultural differences,
the physiological characteristics (one of the passengers consumed
carbondioxide and produced oxygen when he "breathed"), the racial
prejudices and preferences, the uncertainties (at first, it wasn\'t even
clear that there were enough resources for them all to survive), and the
personal agendas and conflicts, the player was almost driven out of his
mind.  I however, had a blast.  And I loved his reaction when he came out
of cold sleep and saw how the situation had changed in the intervening
century!  (There were several interesting cross-breeds on board, and one of
the mated pairs had bred like rabbits; fungus had gone rampant, and his
ship was a total wreck)!

- ----
Another scenario inspired by the survey form above where an "exotic,
ship-based" scenario was selected, follows the adventures of a mercantile
captain who raised a litter of Vargr pups from shortly after birth to young
adulthood, giving them his (notably human) culture.  They\'re his crew.

The answer "Surprise Me" to the genre suggestion question resulted in my
running "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" on the planet Junidy in the Aramis
subsector of the Spinward Marches. For practical purposes I set the
adventure 50 years in the past (circa 1050 Imperial).  None of the players
escaped, but one came close -- though he sacrificed himself to save the
starport from falling to the pod people and thus saved the Imperium.  In a
future scenario, if the players ever visit Junidy again, they\'ll see the
giant memorial statue erected in his honor.

Those players of mine that did not participate in that night\'s session,
have been extremely paranoid that I shall spring the same scenario on them.
This makes it almost impossible for me to run a pod-people adventure with
as much impact (it caught the original group of players completely by
surprise), but I intend to use the atmosphere of paranoia to my advantage
by springing another closely-related movie-based scenario upon them, say
"They Live", or that episode of Star Trek NG where everyone got hypnotized
by a videogame brought back by Riker from his vacation-leave.  Zhodani mass
mind-control is another possibility.  The players\' misassumptions could
have an interesting effect on play.

- ----
The survey has also been quite useful in selecting worlds upon which to
adventure.  "Imperial, Orbital, High Population, Heavily-robotic,
High-Tech" describes Glisten to a tee.  The selection "In-the-action,
War-torn, moderately Alien" resulted in a scenario dealing with the
evacuation of the Darrian bread-basket planet Roget, which had been
mysteriously infested with the Chamax Plague.  "Familiar, Imperial,
Mid-Tech, Non-robotic" fits Regina quite well, especially if you use it as
a standard mustering-out location.  Venejen works well as a "moderately
exotic, low-tech" setting, but adds even more playing options when
Adventure 2 is used.

  ----

Another benefit of an extensively developed game setting is that you can
accomodate just about every combination of players that turn-out to your
gaming sessions.  My campaign typically has 20+ branches going at any given
time, each one accomodating a different combination of the 8 players who
participate in the campaign.  Having hundreds of scenarios available makes
all the difference.

Thus, I\'ve had to keep a "Campaign Roster" listing the combinations of
players and the scenarios currently being played by each.  The roster
includes the names of the players, a title for the scenario, the date that
branch of the campaign started, and where in the Traveller universe it
started.  When the players show up for a session, I simply look up on the
roster the scenarios applicable for the particular assortment of players
present, pick one, and away we go.

Of course, they\'re not always in the mood for a particular adventure (e.g.,
bug-hunting hordes of little nasties can get old real fast), so I always
have several scenarios in reserve, and can always fall back on the player
survey method.

  ----

Now that there is a lot of material available for the Traveller game
setting (albeit most of it out-of-print), it gives the referee who has it
more of a feeling that there\'s "a whole universe out there to explore"
rather than the ominous chore of "there\'s a whole universe that\'s supposed
to be out there that I need to create".


                                   Any comments?

P.S.:  A comment concerning punctuation:  My peculiar usage of quotes is
on-purpose.  I use for them the same logical rules as pertain to
parentheses.  This is to avoid the ambiguity that can be caused by placing
punctuation marks such as commas, periods, colons, and exclamation points
within a quotation, when they actually belong to the overall sentence and
not the quote itself.  Therefore you\'ll see such symbols inside and/or
outside the quotation marks, depending upon context.  Simply stated, the
customized grammatical rule followed is:  "Don\'t include anything within
the quotation marks that is not a part of the quotation!"

Standard quotation punctuation is just a little pet peeve of mine.

Hi, Rodge here.

This is in response to Jerry Alexandratos\' letter about receding into pocket
empires.

I strongly disagree with your claim about playing New Era in the Regency.
Playing in the Regency is indeed a viable option, and for die-hard Imperium
fans, offers the best environment for roleplaying in the New Era.

As for venturing into the wilds from there, getting into and out of the
Regency is not that hard.  The border blockade is only 6 or 7 systems deep,
and patrolling the deep space (empty hexes) between occupied systems is not
only NOT easy, it is near impossible, meaning that by stockpiling fuel in deep
space, you could easily cross back over into the Regency after leaving it. I
assume black marketeers and pirates do it all the time.  Even the Virus could
use this method, which means that very strict contact protocols would have to
be mandatory throughout the entire Regency.

As for the big picture, of all the interests concerned with reclaiming the
wilds, the Regency by far has the biggest advantage.  It has the necessary
technological base (including some TL 16 worlds) to thwart and weed out the
virus wherever they find it -- they\'ve even been breeding the Virus, mutating
it to serve their needs.

Not only that, but the basis of the Regency is the keeping of the flame, and
the restoration of the Imperium.  To the people of the Regency, the "Imperium"
isn\'t even considered to be dead.  In a territorial race between the Regency
and the Star Vikings, who do you think would win?  My bet is on the Regency,
its civilization of many billions, and its state-of-the-art fleets.

With the mounds and mounds of materials written for the Spinward Marches, I\'m
glad that they didn\'t blast it out of existence like they did the rest of
developed space.  My campaign is proceeding ahead (circa 1105 in the Spinward
Marches, Foreven, and Far Frontiers sectors) without any undue acceleration --
I doubt if any of the present characters will be alive by the time the New Era
begins.  Heck, I haven\'t even put them through the Fifth Frontier War yet!
This will give the game developers plenty of time to flesh out the new
campaign enough for me to play it without requiring too much custom
development effort from me.  I\'ve got enough Traveller and MegaTraveller stuff
to last me many years.

So far, I\'ve found 350+ items written for Traveller.  Its going to take me
some time to play them, let alone read them all.

Anyways, when my campaign finally gets to the coming of the Virus, it will be
quite interesting to see how the players respond to Armageddon (sp).  I fully
intend to play it out.

- ----

Now to cover the issue raised by some about fleeing this message conference:

My attitude is this:  The more Traveller-related conferences the merrier!  I
collect them all anyways.  Adding another script to one\'s comm program just
ain\'t that hard.

If you are worried that this conference is waning because the participants are
moving to other conferences, then you are getting too political.  Enjoy this
conference, and make it more enjoyable, and people will flock.

By the way, 442 members ain\'t bad!

how economics worked - mostly for income & ships for the planets in a TCS
game - but here\'s what I\'ve worked up.

Now... these are all guesstimates, but seem to work for realities sake in
my game.

For the number of Naval ships in/around a planet, multiply the population
code by the trade # (the table in Traveller that rates exchange rates -
TL15, Starport A = 1). Some examples of this calc: Jenghe (Spinward Marches)
would have 4 naval ships, Regina: 8, Efate: 10. For naval ships - I had in
mind something along the lines of a TypeT patrol ship or SDB.

The number of merchanter\'s in port / orbiting at any given time is given by
the same calc (Pop Code x Exchange Rate) x (6+1d6-1d6). This gives a range
of the same number of Naval ships to 35x the number of naval ships.

I\'m sure someone else has similiar ideas... anyone?

Comments: A product of the Alliance Free Trade Agreement, this grav car
is built on Neubayern, but depends on a New Home fusion reactor for
power. The 350gsc\'s thruster plates are far more powerful than they
really need to be--the extra power makes this car well suited to perform
fancy maneuvers in crowded terrain. It\'s basically a grav equivalent of
the aircraft used for pylon races on Earth prior to World War II.

This model is aimed primarily at rich enthusiasts, although several have
been sold as courier vehicles to large companies and government agencies.
Anyone buying this car must have an Aerospace Fighter license, which is
in itself rather expensive.

Comments: The F-6 Wyvern is the standard gunship of the Neubayern Army.  It
entered service in 5618, and has been used in several recent conflicts.
The Wyvern\'s mission is primarily to engage ground targets and provide
close air support for friendly troops. It is also good at air superiority
missions, although this role is usually left to aerospace fighters.

Wyvern pilots have a huge missile load at their disposal, and are taught
to use it extravagantly. When engaging enemy aircraft, Wyverns generally
fire a dozen or more air-to-air missiles to keep the enemy busy while the
Wyvern maneuvers in for the kill. If the enemy aircraft tries to return
the favor, the Wyvern\'s 30mm cannon is equipped for point-defense fire.

Design Notes: Designing a useful turret gun for this gunship turned out
to be a major headache. None of the design sequences in FF&S produced a
totally satisfactory gun--the high energy weapon sequence was especially
bad. To get the 30mm gun here, I designed a mass driver \'by the book\' and
multiplied its range by 10 and its damage by 3.

Does anyone have any idea why the book design sequence gives a 30mm
cannon with a muzzle velocity of 6000m/s good penetration, but less
damage and range than a .50 M2HB machinegun?

Last call for the Traveller Campaign Survey!


In response to some traffic last week, I decided it would be interesting to
know how many of (correct me if I\'m wrong, James) TML\'s 440-odd members are
actively playing or refereeing a Traveller campaign, and what they\'re
playing.

I\'m making a second call for responses, because I simply can\'t believe that
only 15 of you (16 counting myself) are actually playing Traveller!

If you are currently (or in the recent past or very near future) playing
Traveller, please send me a short, quick email message and let me know what
rules system you are using and what background you are in.

Send e-mail to: wildstar@quark.qrc.com

And tell me:

1) What Rules System:
	a) Classic Traveller		This includes Traveller and Deluxe
					Traveller (the black books in the black
					box), The Traveller Book, and Starter
					Traveller

	b) Traveller:2300		This includes Traveller:2300 and 2300AD
	c) MegaTraveller		You know, the Rebellion-era stuff
	d) Traveller: The New Era	This includes Traveller: The New
					Era and Deluxe Traveller: The New Era
	e) GURPS			GURPS Traveller (GURPS rules and a
					"Traveller-esque" background are
					aparrently a popular alternative)

2) What Background Universe:
	a) The Third Imperium		Classic Traveller\'s background
	b) The Shattered Imperium	MegaTraveller\'s background, also
					known as the Rebellion
	c) The New Era			T:TNE\'s background, with or without
					the Virus.
	e) Custom			The referee\'s own universe

Allen, why don\'t you try a twist on creature contest idea mentioned recently?
 The next planet your group stumbles upon was once used for  hyper-reality
gaming where gaming computers assisted in running various gaming scenarios
using robots for NPCs and monsters played by patrons visiting this world.
When the Virus hit instead of the usual effect it corrupted the gaming
computers so that injury is now possible for those in the games, and the PCs
now find themselves in one!

You could then use modules from other games, Call of Cthulhu or TW2K could be
interesting or even Cadillacs & Dinosaurs (or is that Air/rafts &
Allosaurs?).  The gaming computers could be in such a state of disrepair that
the group would have to work through many scenarios before locating and
gaining entry into the main control building where they could shut down the
system (if they ever determine exactly what is happening!)  Maybe they\'ll
just be glad to find their way back to their ship and run to fight another
day!n

after the arrival of FF&S, I am back alife. Okay, here are the results of
the german jury:

At first the positiv remarks...they are a bit shorter!

- - I like the variety of FTL Travel methods.
- - I like the different Maneuver drives...especially the reintroduction
  of thruster plates. This includes the Dean drive...though I suppose
  it has nothing to do with Rob Dean ? ;-)
- - The addition of PNF Piezo nuclear Fusion is wonderfull!
- - I like the rules for Cyberware.
- - Wow...they used the metric system...I think I should mention that,
  because very few game companies do use this system in their design
  rules. Something to praise is the table on page 5!

Well let us change to the bad ideas.

Guys at GDW, what do you think about announcing a book full of technological
rules which cover all parts of technical problems, and then forget about
wet navy ships ? I am planning a campaign for such an environment since
TNE came out. And what happens? They do not include the required rules,
though they put in some artifical gills in the cyberware rules and even
aquatic skin! But how can I use such things without submarines ?

What the book does include are 62 pages full of weapon design rules, complete
with ideas how the weapons work and on and on and on and on.... all those
shit I do not like! Well I know that this is my own impression, but gee...
following the discussion on this list, even this thick book of rules is
not complete.

Some of the design sequences give me some trouble, but more detailed comments
on this in later postings.

All in all I was dissapointed by this source book. I thought I would get
more technic, and less weapons then I got.

Does anybody out there know the basis for the size code To Hit
modifiers in HG?  You know, ships less than 100T (Size 0) get a -2 to
be hit, <2000T gets a -1, <20,000T gets a +0, <75,000T gets a +1,
bigger gets a +2.

This looks sort of logarithmic.  However, it\'s not reduceable to an
equation.

So, I thought it might be based on the surface area of the sphere
whose volume is the tonnage.  Unfortunately, this didn\'t work either.

Has anybody else been concerned enough about this to figure it out?

Thanks.

the first thing I tried to do after getting FF&S was building a light
Helicopter. Browsing to the book, I found a special Lt MTR assembly, for
Helis with less than 2 tons. And so I start to build one using this
rotor assembly. I checked a source for actual (1994) Helicopter designs,
to find a base for a start.

Here is a list of the IC-Powered helicopters available on the market today:
                        Power  un/loaded weight  speed    range   Weight/
                       (in KW)        (in kg)  (in km/h) (in km)  Thrust ratio
Robinson R22 Beta        119          379/621     180      592      5.22
Rotorway Exec 90         113          420/646     153      290      5.72
Brantly B-2B             134          463/757     145      400      5.65
Schweizer 300C           142          474/930     153      360      6.55
(source: Flug Revue,January 1994, p.75; ISSN 0015-4547)

For my design, I take the following data:
loaded weight: 720 kg; range: about 500 km...so I get a performance between
the R22 and the B-2B.

I start using the Lt MTR construction, which provides a Thrust/Power-Ratio
of 4. Using 720 kg as base, we need a 180 KW engine...very big in comparison
to the numbers above. Next step is the engine weight: The improved
Internal combustion engine weights 450 kg...ups...only 270 kg left
for those necessities named Frame, Pilot Seat and Fuel. And because the
engine needs 112.5 kg of fuel per hour, I would get an endurance of
less than 1 hour if I would like to load at least two pilots (75 kg each).
Obviously this figures do not work.

The obvious problem is the weight of the engine and the Thrust-to-Power ratio
of the Light Main-Tail-Rotor assembly. To get the things running, I used
a Thrust-to-Power ratio of 6 instead of 4. The following design is the result:

projected weight: 720 kg; TL: 6
Power Plant (120KW)     300.00 kg      600 Cr (!) imp.IC
Lt MTR Assembly          54.00 kg     5400 Cr
Airframe (Simple)         7.20 kg     7200 Cr
Basic Mech. Controls      0.00 kg      200 Cr
2 Cramped Seats          40.00 kg     2000 Cr
TL-5 Flight Avionics      1.00 kg    10000 Cr used, because no power req.
Radio (30km) TL 8!       10.00 kg      250 Cr requires 1 KW! ridiculous!
Fuel (2h)               150.00 kg
                      ----   ----
                        562.20 kg    25650 Cr
=> 157.80 payload, pilot and passenger.
Thrust: 120*6*0.1 = 72 tons => G-Rating: 72/720 *0.85= 0.085
Max Speed: 3500 * 0.085 = 297.5 kph => Cruising Speed = 220 kph
NOE Speed = 40 kph => range: 440 km.

Note that the TL-8 Radio is required, because it is small enough to fit in
the Helicopter. The power consumption of the Radio is - as mentioned -
ridiculous. My RC-sender uses 0.5 Watt (!) for a range of about 1 km.
And a CB uses between 1 and 4 Watts for ranges up to the horizon. Why
do I need 1 KW for a range of only 30 km ?

The sheet of this Helicopter looks like this:
TL: 6(8 for Radio)
Price: 25650 Cr   (compare to $113850 fly away price of a Robinson R22)
Size: 43.2 kl = 3.1 tons (Mc)
Mass: unloaded: 562.2 kg, loaded: 720kg max.
Power: Improved IC=120 KW, Lt MTR assembly creating 720 kg of thrust
Maint: how do I calculate this ?
Controls: Basic Mechanical, TL-5 Flight Avionics
Commo: Radio (39km) TL-8(!)
Sensors: None
Life Support: None
Cargo: 157.8 kg, pilot and passengers included !
Crew: 1
Passenger: 1
Speeds: Max: 297.5, cruising: 220, NOE:40
Travel Move: 880, Combat Move: 41 ...what ever this will mean in such a case
Fuel Capacity: 156 liters = 156 kg
Agility: 4

I did not bother to calculate any other combat factors, because this thing
is likly to come down if hit by something more serious than a pistol bullet.

The problem of this Helicopter is the fact, that it is much too fast for
its power, but according to the rules, we have no choice.

Any comments are strictly encouraged!

P.S.: I will check the design of heavier Helicopters too. They have
      turbine engines as power plants. Perhaps those have a better
      weight to power ratio than the poor Improved Internal Combustion
      engines. Note that a 100 KW imp.IC engine weights 250kg. A bit too
      much if you ask me.

here are some more complaints about FF&S:

1. A serious question to GDW: I though NOTaR is a Trademark of Hughes/
   McDonnel Aircraft corporation. Is this true ?

2. What about wingtip powered rotors ? They do not need any counter torque
   rotor. All those alternative technology, and such an easy variant of
   rotors is not available ?

3. High and Ultra High bypass Turbofans are easily available today. What I
   cannot understand is the low weight to thrust ratio of the engines you
   show in the design table (p.70). A thrust of three tons for 1 ton of
   engine mass is indeed not state of the art today. What about this:
      TL  Type  Th   MCr    MaxT  FC   FT   Airframe
       8  UHBT  10  0.0800  100  0.09  HCD  Fast Supsonic
   I think this will fit to the engines used on an Airbus A330.
   This engine is build for best performance at subsonic speeds!

4. What does EAPlaC mean ? A solid fuel technology I assume ?

5. I thought MHD is a method of moving a ship. Is it possible to
   use the method the other way around ? I wonder because MHD is
   counted as chemical power plant (p.63).

6. Why is the Glide ratio for Helicopters treated as nil ? The autorotation
   is similar to the method of flying an autogiro use.

7. Do workstations include the weight of the operator ?

I hope I can do some designs soon...perhaps I can go around some of
my troubles with the FF&S rules.

Yes and no.  In BL it states that larger installations of Nuclear Dampeners
can attack all incoming targets, but no rules for such a device are provided
in FF&S.  You can make bigger turrets, yes, but not a large "screen"

Even in Bays, they have questionable value ;-)

Anthony Neal\'s article on minuaturization was neat!

Graham.Spearing@gspear.mettav.royle.org asked:

Several sheets and a booklet.  If you get the booklet that comes with
FF&S, that should bring you up to date GDW-wise. You could mail GDW and ask
them for the booklet, if you aren\'t planning on buying FF&S.  I don\'t know if
they\'ll send it to you, but I assume that they will.

I can\'t answer that ;-)

>  Will GDW slay Errata for good with version 1 mod 1?
I would vote no ;-)

I don\'t recall saying that the Regency wasn\'t a viable option.  If I
did, then I\'m sorry, I gave you the wrong impression.  Hell, what am I
saying, my campaign is starting out in the Regency.

But, the impression that I get from reading Survival Margin, and the
background of the Regency in the TNE rulebook is that this is definitely
a *closed* system.  I mean, the way everything is written, I get the
impression that Norris has ships covering every literal inch of his
border.  Also, the problem that I forsee is venturing to Regency worlds.
How is one suppossed to be able to land on them, if their ship doesn\'t
pass inspection?  Granted, a ship could start in the Regency, venture
out into the Wilds, and then sneak back into the Regency, but that isn\'t
the "closed" Regency that I\'m talking about.

It seems (to me at least) as though GDW has made the Regency a block of
space that share the old Imperium history, and has nothing to do with
the rest space.

AA-32SR  12 Homing  100  Dam: 66    1058   7811  10415  8 Cr12,019

Comments: The AA-32SR is the standard short-range missile of the Neubayern
Army.  It is normally used against aircraft, but can be used against any
other target as well.  The AA-32SR has a superdense penetrator warhead, and
tracks its targets with imaging radar.


AP-15I  12 Inertial 10  C:7, B:26 85C   19460   1390  5 Cr4,090

Comments: The AP-15I is Neubayern\'s standard anti-personnel weapon for
aircraft.  Its inertial guidance carries it to a location selected when it
is fired, and once there the SEFOP warhead ejects a parachute and drifts to
the ground.  The warhead looks for targets with an IR sensor, and when a
target is found fires into its top armour.

Subject: Small helicopter


    Haven\'t got FF&S yet.

    Saw a helicopter on Beyond 2000 last night.  Designed/built by the
    guy who designed that expensive Italian car - Lamborghini (?).

    It is a real one person helicopter, not a gyro-copter.

    It weighs 175 Kg.

    Can you come close to building that in FF&S at tech 8-9 ?

Just a note, but Scott should check the *time* until death associated
with the LD50 he quotes. Last time I checked, it was around 30 days, and
the time until 50% dead were reached was halved every time you doubled
the dose (and vice-versa, which led to the interesting observation that
approximately 50% of the people exposed to "background" levels of
radiation would die after 70 years. :-)

Another factor is that this is the *absorbed* radiation dosage. People
don\'t absorb X-Rays and gamma rays very well.

My books are packed, but I was *very* interested in these sort of
figures back when we were designing shelters 20 years ago.

   I think that the closed border is a fact more in the minds of the
   citizens of the regency than in actual fact.  From reading survival
   margin, I get the impression that the governing forces in the regency
   would like to "officially" get back in contact with the rest of the
   old imperium, but that they are treading cautiously because of the
   virus fear in the general populace.

   There probably would be opportunities for campaigns based around this
   internal debate within the regency, with players coming down on
   either side, although I imagine most would take the side of expansion
   into the wilds, unless of course the virus was proven to somehow
   still be a threat, maybe throwing them against the powers that want
   to open the borders.

   As for the Star Vikings.. I don\'t like these guys.  They feel like
   both pawns of a Hivers game, plus their economy is based on piracy
   and stealing from other cultures/societies wealth.. very much like
   some of the European powers in the past.  I almost wish they could
   run into a new Solomani league.

   I\'m really curious what happened on Earth/Terra.  YEs, it was
   probably terrible, but Earth should come back a lot faster than most
   places assuming there wasn\'t a nuclear exchange or something.  There
   are real non-compter based libraries on earth from which to rebuild,
   unlike on may more recently settled worlds.  I wonder what would have
   happened to the Solomani movement.. if it woudl have survived.. or if
   it would be even more rabid given what was unleashed by the Imperium
   with the virus.

	Hi people, this is the first ever mail message I\'ve sent across the
net so I hope that this gets through. I\'ve been reading this mailing list
for about a month now and have decided to throw my tuppence worth into the
ring.
	First, I GM TNE and love it, despite the bugs. I also GMed CT
and MT in my murky past and found that the one thing that the Universe
lacked, for me at any rate, was a Frontier. Somewhere to go for things
like first contact missions. Somewhere for the thrill of discovering
lost civilisations, being somewhere no-one had been for a while etc.
The wilderness gives that. Thanks.

	Second, I too think that the RCES will make good bad guys. I
can see their \'become one of us or we\'ll shoot you\' attitude contrasting
violently with the IISS (remember them?) when they come out of their
self-imposed retirement in the Regency. What happens if the RCES come
across not a TED but a well-organised society that is perfectly happy?
Don\'t knock low-tech equiptment. The Lea-Enfield .303 rifle first came
out at TL4-5, has more stopping power than an M16 and an effective
range of over a kilometer. Contrast that to to 400m or so of modern
assault rifles. A British soldier of the period was trained to fire 15
AIMED shots a minute with that beastie, a feat that can seem like
auto-fire to those on the other end (cf Germans at Mons 1914).
	Come to think of it, a Brown Bess musket fires a ball a solid
inch in diameter. Not pleasent.

	Next, a personal plea from little me, for I am an ecologist
and know little of the arcane arts of technology. It seems to me that
quite a few people out there are somewhat hardware obssessed. The point
of an RPG is surely to interact with people/aliens, not to lose
sleep over the finer points of aiming lasers. Now I enjoy the use
of large guns at certain times as much as anyone (although I consider
the moral point raised in Challenge 71 that blowing large hole in someone
is nicer than blinding them a bit suspect to say the least), but there
is more
	I would like to see more on the various culture people have come
up with. The purpose of Travellers is travel. This pursuit will rapidly
lose its interest if everywhere is like late 20th century America. My
current campaign is run on Atsa, which I\'ve given a very Russian feel
to - including the names. It immediately makes the PCs feel like
outsiders. What have other people done - I\'m sure there are far more
original cultures people have come out with that I could steal - please
post them!

	Ranting over. One final thing. To the outside world the difference
between the Black Curtain and the Regency will be nil. Nothing that goes
in is ever heard of again. Something to consider when trying to hire
a Free Trader in Deneb.

ToryArms 3-Pack System:
 Early in 560ti, the Imperial Navy put out a request for Proposal for a new
modular weapons system.  Several companies entered into final bidding in late
561ti,  and the Navy accepted the ToryArms bid before years end.  As the Navy
expanded,  and the Scout service accepted the 3-Pack, ToryArms had more and more
trouble meeting Imperial orders.  The First Frontier war created a huge demand
for 3-Pack systems,  and ToryArms couldn\'t meet it.  In desperate need of more
units,  and under extreme pressure from several megacorps,  the Imperial Navy
releases the 3-Pack specifications to the public.  As more and more
manufacturers started producing 4-Pack systems, they became cheaper and more
common.  As the years passed,  the 3-Pack became the standard turret system
built and installed on almost all ships.

 The basis for the system is the 3-Pack turret.  The turret combines three
modular bays and an appropriate Tech Level of workstation.  The turret is then
fitted with up to three modules.  Most modules are completely self contained,
except for power input.  Self contained modules are available for lasers,
missile launchers, and sandcasters.  Both fusion and Plasma guns are available,
but require an additional Ammunition module.

 During the rebellion, as the Imperial Navy splintered and production centers
were bombed,  the 3-Pack began to be replaced by a wide variety of weapons
systems.  With the collapse of the Imperium,  the 3-Pack system has become even
more rare.  Without the high level of Imperial standardization,  and Imperium
wide mass production,  the 3-Pack has been replaced by other designs.  The
3-Pack system can still be obtained at many spaceports in the Regency,  but
availability outside of the Regency is unknown.

 Fire control limits allow mixing of different weapons only on ships with ten
or less turrets.  Fire control on larger installations of mixed turrets hampers
effective weapons control.  All weapons tasks become 2 levels more difficult on
ships with mixed weapons turrets and more than 10 turrets.

	I have to differ...if it was truly closed tight, then they
wouldn\'t be able to tell that " But there is increasing evidence that the
Virus has largely died back in the Wilds..." (TNE manual, p 171) I suspect
that the Regency is far more open than anyone but the highest authorities
and the smugglers know.  Granted, this is reading between the lines of TNE,
but it\'s supported by the the section on the Regency Economy on the
previous page, that it\'s already known within the Regency that they have
to open up or collapse.

	Since, realistically, any blockade of interstellar space is going
to be as leaky as a sieve, and the book states that "..it [Quarantine
measures] has evolved into an efficient system of taxation and revenue
generation.." (TNE p. 168), I would suspect that in many places,
particularly the inner portions of the Regency, less exposed to the Wilds,
and amid impending signs of economic collapse, the whole process is quite
open to evasion and corruption.

	This woould make a good basis for a campaign in the Regency; the
players could be smugglers, or the cops trying to catch the smugglers,
all, of course an the QT, since \'officially\' there ARE no smugglers.

Well, my point was that the Traveller hand held x-ray laser (be it pistol
carbine, or rifle) is going to hit a person with many many many orders
of magnatude more x-ray energy than an LD50 of 67 calories.  You can\'t
even heat a milliliter of water to boiling with 67 calories, nevermind
vaporize someone\'s skin with it.  I would estimate that it would be on
the order of more than a THOUSAND times the LD50 value.  Probably more.
Probably much more.

And in order to do as much damage as those lasers are supposed to do to
actual body tissue (burn off and or vaporize arms, legs, heads and other
useful extremities...)  We are clearly working with energy densities where
the radiation absorbed IS a thousand times more than LD50.

I admit that I am only a week into the Grad program here in Radiological
Sciences (Medical Physics) but the time scale we\'re talking about here
says death occurs in hours to days.

Someone else (who\'s name I forget unfortunately) pointed out that the
dose of x-rays was incidental to the initial damage done.  Who cares
about radiation poisoning when you have all that medical tech hanging
around at those Tech levels.  Well, I\'d say that the x-ray laser of TL13
is rather like the cyanide coated bullets of today.  If it hits you, you
need treatment IMMEDIATELY or you will die.  If it hits you in the hand,
or the foot, you are just as dead as if it hits you in the chest.

A low powered x-ray laser would make the perfect assasin weapon.  You hit
someone with a tiny x-ray laser.  They don\'t see it or feel it.  (Not if
LD50 is only 67 calories)  Unless they\'re carrying an x-ray detector on
their person, and unless the beam hits the detector, they won\'t even know
they\'ve been hit till they start feeling sick.  (Too late)  And if you
can put an x-ray laser inside a pistol that can punch holes in walls, I\'d
guess you could put a low power one inside your hand computer or digital
watch.

I have a rather large amount of info for a campaign set in the universe of
Steve Higginbotham\'s just-ended TCS game. Most of it is still to disorganized
to make sense to people who weren\'t in the game, but some of it can stand
alone (more or less), like this file.

The city of NeuBerlin is the capital city (indeed, the only city at the
moment) of Neubayern, and was founded in 4517 AD. The population in 5641
(1120 Imperial) is approximately 2.56 billion, and the city covers 350,000
square kilometers.

Disclaimer: The following information is only a rough draft, and ia not
guaranteed to be complete or logical. Any suggestions are welcome.

                NeuBerlin Metropolitan Police Force (circa 5641 AD)

The NeuBerlin Metropolitan Police Force is the largest law enforcement
agency of the Neubayern Federation. It was established shortly after the
founding of the city, in 4520 AD. At present the NMPF employs around 5.8
million police officers, making it one of the largest metro police forces
in the Cluster (possibly even the largest).

The NMPF has divided the city into sectors, each of which is roughly 625
square kilometers--there are 560 sectors in NeuBerlin. A sector is
patrolled by a police division, which has around 7000 officers (officers
in the starport sectors like to remind Marines that the NMPF has more
than ten times as many divisions as the Marine Corps).

Each division has a sector headquarters that serves as a base of
operations. In addition, some of the more crime-ridden sectors have
additional stations located throughout the sector. Each sector HQ contains
offices, holding cells, interrogation rooms, forensic labs, weapons
lockers, parking garages, hangers, firing ranges, and everything else
needed for the day-to-day operations of the police division.

Police officers normally patrol in a two-seat police spinner. When
arrests are made, officers call for a grav van to take the prisoners back
to the sector HQ. In addition to the officer\'s sidearms, each spinner
normally has an ARC-10 stored inside. If the patrolling officers
encounter anything they can\'t handle with the ARC-10, they call in one of
the NMPF\'s numerous special units.

                            Special Units

In addition to the patrol officers, the NMPF has a number of departments
which handle special duties. Many of these departments enjoy a high
degree of autonomy, a fact which sometimes leads to resentment from the
regular NMPF.

                    Special Weapons and Tactics Department

The SWAT Department is the special unit with the closest ties to the
regular Force. Each sector HQ has one or more SWAT Teams assigned
permanently--these teams are dispatched to deal with any crisis (defined
as citizens who shoot back). SWAT officers wear combat armour, and carry
ARC-10s, Police Blasters, and an assortment of allegedly non-lethal
weapons. Whenever SWAT runs into something they can\'t handle (citizens
who shoot back with bigger guns), they call in another special unit--the
Advanced Police Department.

                        Advanced Police Department

The AD Police are a relatively small unit, with only 15,000 officers.
This is the unit with the highest funding and training standards, and it
shows in their performance and equipment. The ADP is organized into
Mobile Forces, each of which is equipped with a wide variety of heavy
weapons. AD Police officers normally use Police Hardsuits, a lightweight
class of power armour which has slightly less protection than Imperial
Battledress but much greater maneuverabiity. When facing criminals with
especially heavy firepower, the ADP uses an unusual type of Armoured
Trooper which is designed to either operate independently as a police
robot or be worn over the Police Hardsuit.

In addition to their role as a response force, the ADP is also
responsible for investigating acts of terrorism and crimes involving
unusually dangerous perpetrators.

The ADP is largely autonomous, and its high visibility makes it a natural
target for criticism from assorted advocates of civil rights. Although
most residents of NeuBerlin will never personally see the ADP in action,
the violent nature of its activities ensures that virtually anything ADP
does will get on the news.

                        NeuBerlin Highway Patrol

The NHP is the largest of the special units, and like the AD Police it is
somewhat autonomous. However, it is more closely tied to the regular
NMPF, with NHP stations generally being located within NMPF Sector HQs.
NHP and NMPF officers often work together, and it is not uncommon for
NMPF officers to transfer to the NHP and vice versa.

The NHP is responsible for patrolling NeuBerlin\'s highways and flyways.
To do this, the NHP uses a tremendous variety of vehicles, ranging from
wheeled motorcycles to police spinners to FA-1 fighters discarded by the
Navy.

The NHP is somewhat unappreciated because many citizens blame them for
NeuBerlin\'s chronically bad traffic problems, but they actually manage to
keep the roads pretty safe.

                        Network Police Department

The Network Police Department (NetPol) is responsible for investigating
crimes conducted using the computer network. NetPol has somewhat broader
jurisdicion than the rest of the NMPF--it is responsible for all computer
networks on Neubayern, not just in NeuBerlin. This jurisdiction dates
back to the early years of Neubayern when NeuBerlin was the only city
that really needed police for its network. Before the Serendip War, other
cities had lobbied to make NetPol a Federal agency, but the destruction
of those other cities has ended such efforts.

NetPol employs a small number of highly-skilled investigators. They
generally have little street experience, and whenever they expect to
encounter armed criminals they bring local Metro officers along for backup.

                        Esper Crimes Department

Since Esper Crimes aren\'t very common, this department (also called ESPol)
has jurisdiction over all of Neubayern space.  ESPol is the newest special
unit, having been formed in 5640 after the Imperial forces were ejected.
The ESPol normally looks into crimes commited by espers, although it can
look into other crimes at its discretion.  ESPol is very powerful, and
recruite are required to be responsible and never abuse their power.  ESPol
is familiar with the Tavrchedl\', and is determined to never act anything
like it.

There has been some tension between AD Police officers and ESPol
officers. The ADP officers feel that esper crimes should fall into their
jurisdiction (as they involve unusual and dangerous perpetrators), and
regard the creation of ESPol as something of an insult.

                        NMPF Patrol Officer Equipment

A Metro officer\'s uniform is dark blue with a badge and equipment belt. A
ballistic cloth vest is worn under the uniform to provide protection.
Although the equipment is much improved, the uniform itself is basically
identical to those worn by Southern California police deparments in the
late 20th century.

NMPF officers are armed with SGP-22 "Police Blasters," and they carry two
spare magazines. They also carry superdense handcuffs, a tonfa, and a
hand computer (which includes communication equipment).

                        NMPF Patrol Vehicle Equipment

The police spinners used by the NMPF have a larger computer, a long-range
radio, and active and passive EMS systems.  They also carry heavier armour
(generally breastplates and helmets), an ARC-10, and several magazines for
the ARC-10.  Although not officially authorized, many Metro officers manage
to pick up a rifle grenade or two for use with the ARC-10.

                            Police Powers

Police power is somewhat limited by the fact that Neubayern\'s legal
system has a split personnality. For most of its history, Neubayern was a
socialist republic very much like those that existed in Europe when the
colonists left Earth. Under this system, police powers had substantial
limitations, and many of the "victimless crimes" such as drug use and
prostitution had been legalized.

Neubayern\'s legal system, like everything else, was substantially altered
following the first attacks by Serendip Belt starships. When the current
system of government was instituted, the ruling class became interested
in increasing police powers, but only where such an increase would not
affect them.

Because the rulers wanted to remain a _charismatic_ oligarchy, they
needed to find ways to increase police powers without making the common
people unhappy. To do this, they resorted to a method which had proven
successful on Earth millenia ago--they began a "War on Drugs." This
basically involved producing lots of propoganda about how evil
recreational drugs (and people having anything to do with them) are,
making them illegal, and then passing lots of laws that basically let the
police do whatever they want to. However, they included exemptions for
all members of the ruling class in their new laws.

Law enforcement agencies still want to keep the people happy, though, so
when they decide to ignore someone\'s civil rights they are careful to
feed the media lots of stories about how the target is an evil drug
dealer/terrorist/child pornographer/hacker. In this respect, they have
much in common with American federal law enforcement in the 20th century.

The most important restraint on police power is the fact that members of
the ruling "samurai" class (which makes up almost 10% of the population)
still have rights. These people can say what they want, are innocent
until proven guilty, can\'t be searched without a warrant, and are exempt
from gun control laws. Because of all this, the police leave them alone
unless they actually do something wrong.

The Imperial Occupation didn\'t interfere greatly with Neubayern law, but
nevertheless once the Alliance drove them away the government decided to
restrore many of the rights that had been taken in the years before.

First, thanks to those h/w freaks who post their designs to the list. Since
I lack the patience to work through designs most of the time I appreciate
having a source I can steal extra designs from.

Now, to address AFP123\'s request - I not an expert on culture so I\'ll just
give you some scenario settings I have used:

Probably the most memorable Traveller I ever ran was based on Western
movies. Simply called \'The Mexicans\', PCs were members of the scout service
of a colony descended from Scouts/Colonists. Their culture was \'Hispanic\',
whenever we needed details. However, they as PCs were the \'heroes\',
wandering around an area loosely based on the Hollywood version of the
American West. There were also some 1920s gangster elements mixed in. So,
at least a little different: late 19th/early 20th century America.

Another scenario was based on Western Europe in WWII. A lot of WWII war
movies provided background for that. The plot was sort of borrowed from
Star Trek: a Balkanised planet within an area known as the Neutral Zone was
being used as a testing ground by one of two rival planetary alliances.
Each of these alliances existed within an overall body known as the
Commonwealth(it wasn\'t a standard traveller universe). Meddling in the
Neutral Zone was of course a no-no as far as the Commonwealth was
concerned. The PCs were \'special forces\' types (ie MERCENARY generated
characters) sent in by the alliance which was losing to gather evidence of
the other alliance\'s meddling in the Neutral Zone. Their tech was of course
limited to that of the locals, except for some miniaturised high tech comms
gear.

Both of these worked quite well. Both were different - not just the fact
that both were lower tech than Imperial norm either. I hope you can make
use of them.

Another setting I have used in SF is inspired by the 3 Aliens movies plus
Blade Runner. This for me tends to define what the Early Stellar tech code
is like. While it may not be standard Traveller, I don\'t have a problem
with modifying \'low passage\' a bit to allow for passengers and crew to
travel relatively safely.

As you can probably guess by now I get a lot of inspiration from movies: I
find they are a good way to convey \'look and feel\' and the general \'spirit\'
of a setting to the PCs. And with the availability of films etc on video,
if people didn\'t see the movie that is something fairly easily remedied.

Anyone else have some good settings/cultures they\'d like to share?

I love it!  A hand computer with the ultimate interface - point it at

So did Britta B. Damwitz or Scott 2G Kellogg write what I quoted?  Or is

You touch on a pet peeve of mine. IMO those TL to Terran dates mappings
are NOT meant to be taken to litterally. The dates are only a rule of
thumb to help Refs estimate the TL of stuff that isn\'t explicitly
mentioned. Anything explicitly mentioned is independent of Terran dates.
Thus I believe that a TL 8 computer corresponds to the state of the art
on Terra today. We may be at TL 9 or 10 already  -  with respect to
computers. We obviously aren\'t wrt. space travel. Single-shot rifles
are TL 4, and will remain so even if historians discover a working
medieval single-shot rifle (design by da Vinci, perhaps? ;-).
(Incidentally, rifles were used in the Napoleonic war; some multi-shot
pistols were made in France around 1760 (They were revolved by hand,
and never really caught on)).

According to my references, about 680 Megabytes, although recent
technological breakthroughs promise to push the capacity of optical
storage up to over a Terabyte per cubic inch.

Regarding Stewart Johnson\'s comment on tech levels:

"Aren\'t the TLs a bit out
at lower levels? TL4 is c1850 whilst TL5 is c1930. Thus WWI was
officially fought at TL4 wasn\'t it? I tend to find it easier to
think of TLs in terms of weaponry and the first single-shot rifles
can into service c1860-1880. Certainly we Brits were using Martini-Henry
rifles in 1879 to fight Zulus with, and the Winchester probably
predates that?"

I agree with the points Stewart makes.  Regarding tech advances between
1855-1920 in the non military fields there are many examples of a rapid
increase in technology.  The emerging fields of microbiology and
immunology made possible the first rational medical treatments for
diseases of civilization i.e. cholera, syphilis,  and the first vaccines
for things like rabies.  The explosion of breakthroughs in chemistry led
to the ability to make nitrogen compounds from the air (instead of bird shit)
which in turn drove the agricultural (fertilizer) and weapons(smokeless
powder, dynamite, TNT) revolution.  All the the advances between 1870-1914
allowed populations to increase, people to live longer and specialize in
these new technological fields but at the same time new fears emerged that
worsened and reached its peak in the nationalistic 30s.
I would consider the time between 1855 and 1930 and interim time
between tech levels 4 and 5.  You have to draw the line somewhere.  So
tech level 4 is coal and steam driven industrialization.  Tech level 5 is
technology uninfluenced by atomic and subatomic physics that brought on
the atomic age.
Of course you cannot pigeon hole an entire civilization into a
"tech level".  Part of the fun of going to a civilization is the surprize
twists you can have in the plot when the players encounter say germ
warfare in a tech level 4 society.

YES!  Finally some meat to the TML!  I love hearing about other people\'s
scenarios.  I\'ve felt very much a novice in this list because I have a very
old version of Traveller and haven\'t played for years.  However, I have
designed a Rimworld scenario that I feel might provide some interesting
possibilities for other gamers.

     Omega Rim is a small imperial outpost on the rim of the galaxy which
orbits a Type K star.  The station consists of a series of domed sectors
and is under military rule (Imperial).  While on a routine sweep through
the sector, 3 civvies are rescued from an escape pod and tell an unlikely
story of hijacking and aliens.  Apparently, the liner "Penelope" (which has
been missing for about a month) was hijacked and taken to an uncharted star
system near Omega Rim.  The captives (those who survived the hijacking)
were told they would be kept alive as long as they cooperated.  The
Hijackers then sent them down in an unarmed ship\'s boat to the uncharted
planet\'s surface where they encountered a pyramidical stone structure.
After touching off an automatic door mechanism by mistake, the party finds
a (formerly) sealed control center which appears to have been on this
planet for centuries.  Reptilian skeletons adorn the control room in
attitudes that indicate they were struck down in mid-duty.  One of the more
medically-inclined of the survivors discovered that the aliens were killed
by strange lightning-fast virus. All of the survivors have noticed a change
in their eyesight since entering the pyramid, but no other effects.

The control room is STILL ACTIVE and some fiddling reveals a starship and a
sealed chamber with an intact alien in stasis nearby.  They give the alien
a wide berth and decide to use the starship to escape the pirates.  As they
power up the ship, a loudspeaker chimes and crackles in some alien
language, then the entire complex comes alive - literally.  The alien wakes
up and starts shooting.  The civvies escape (barely) and as they leave the
planet, they notice the tell-tale lights of other ships leaving the
planetary gravity well.  The ships are identical to their own.  The last
sight they see before slipping into hyperdrive is the Penelope being
vaporized by blue-white light.  The alien ship gets them close to Omega
Rim, but they discover that the ship has a radiation leak that is
life-threatening.  Their last desparate act is to launch the escape pod
before finally, the ship explodes.  They are convinced that the planet was
host to a forerunner outpost or the advance party for a centuries-old
invasion that may have been stopped by the virus.

The commandant of the outpost doesn\'t believe a word of their story. He
puts them in quarantine until he can verify the story.

The questions that remain to be answered:
(1) What happened to the other alien ships that launched from the planet?
(2) What long-term effect did the virus have on the humans?
(3) Why were the pirates interested in the first place?
(4) What\'s being done with the alien escape pod?


Let me know what you think of this scenario and I can email you
(separately) more of the particulars for Subsector Carina at the galaxial
rim.

Subject: Traveller Questions

Traveller Questions(Long):
==========================

I have been doing some preparation for when my Traveller campaign comes out
of cold sleep later on this year. This has prompted the following
questions. I\'ve sketched out some answers I\'ve thought of and would like to
know what other people\'s views are, for and against - any feedback would be
appreciated, especially from the point of view of the \'Classic\' Third
Imperium, c.1100-1115

Q: I can\'t remember where it is stated but it is my impression that once
you go outside the boundaries of the starport on the world you are subject
to that world\'s law level. So what happens if/when PCs get in trouble? Can
the Imperial gov\'t intervene, and does it? How would this relate to the
Imperial Ministry of Justice as described in a Challenge article some time
ago?

A: It depends on the circumstances of the treaty by which the world became
a member of the imperium. A standard agreement would be that no world could
harbour an \'Enemy of the Imperium\' - ie wanted for an Imperial offense. In
return, those guilty of local crime are extradited if caught back to the
planet, with the exception of status B (nobles) and above, who can elect to
be tried by an Imperial court - typically for the crime of \'Conduct
prejudicial to the good of the Imperium\'.

Imperial military have better things to do than hunt down any but major
criminals, so bounty hunters are likely to do a thriving trade. There are
also likely to be extradition agreements and police cooperation agreements
between many collections of systems, \'brokered\' as it were by the Imperium:
perhaps by the Imperial Ministry of Justice?

As for the idea of the Imperial Ministry of Justice, except for such
Interstellar Crime and influence on Military Justice I don\'t think it would
have much say about what happens locally.  I\'m not real sure: I can\'t find
the article in my collection so I could be remembering incorrectly.

Q: If the law & government level describes the world outside the starport,
what determines what is the law level and government type -in- the
starport?

A: Law level and Government are based on the applicable subsector capital.
Note however that appeals could be made to the Sector Court at the Sector
Capital, and are likely to be influenced by the Sector Capital\'s law/Gov\'t
type.

Q: If you assume the UWP is describing the world and not the starport, what
tech level should the starports be?

A: Average Stellar, or world tech, whichever is higher.

Q: If a world is TL\'n\', does that mean that outside the starport the PCs
are limited to TL\'n\' equipment? If not, how do you deal with the effects of
having PCs with high tech equipment on low tech worlds? And what about the
reverse?

A: Yes, characters are limited to equipment in the same tech code. Why? so
they don\'t disrupt the local society and economy too much. Political,
social, and economic stability are valued highly, and having all three most
of the time is probably why the Imperium lasted as long as it did.

I must disagree.  I like the RCES (or Star Viking..)  the setting
will let you have more freedom to create whatever
 background that you want.  develop the service as you wise
 and more.  About the Hivers, well, they help the RC to get back
on their feet, but the Hiver do not control the RC.  about Piracy..
 well, their are other good points for the service (RCES) like
 recontact lost worlds, help rebuild them, help develop the RC,
to raise the level of living within it and around it (the near wilds
 area).  basicliy, a young coalition building it\'s self.  I like the
 settings/RCES

You are right.  GDW created T:TNE while thinking
 about all the Mega/CT players..  "You want to continue
 playing in the Imperium?..  Use the
 Regency.  You want to play in a kinda Imperium
 (young Imperium, where you can control it\'s development?..
 play the StarViking.
 you want to play your own game, use the Pockets.."..
 thus, opening T:TNE for all levels of players.  ofcourse
 there are a few changes, but a CT adv. can still be
 played if people want to in T:TNE rules/history.

Yap.  it also helpful if a group of people want to talk about a
 spacific subject like T:TNE Pockets empires and stuff.  So if
 the reader is intersted in Pockets, they can join that group
 for more detailed  information.  As it was said before, it would
 be nice to get some updates reports back to TML.

Take care,

Hi there, well to answer your questions (whatever I can...)
1.  they are out..  I\'ve already seen them at my local RPG store..
2. no idea..
3. as last i read (from the package GDW sent me when I
 asked for a list of products)  they consider a few writers,
 but no date is set for release) common day words:
 I\'ll buy it for my grandkids (and i\'m only 18 :-)

take care,

A discussion that recently appeared in one of the Computer magazines I
subscribe to (PC World or PC/Computing) theorized that computers could become
smaller by using small screen that could be worn like eyeglasses and
positioned in front of the user\'s eye when in use.  In Traveller hologram
projecters would be another alternative to screens  to permit miniturization.
 An alternate method of input that is within reach today are computers that
accept voice commands and eliminate the need for keyboards.

Granted there will probably be limits to miniturizing computers but smaller
devices than currently present in official rules are within reason.

Keep those two down, and you can get results akin to CT and MT.

That was the goal of that HAIS system I posted. I just have time
for quick notes right now, so I\'ll post the revised version
on another day.

an open note for Loren: This disparity in crew levels between
FF&S/BL and previous editions is a real obstacle for those of
us who want to use NEW ERA rules in an Imperial setting.(and/or
gamemasters who don\'t want to keep track of 15-20 NPC crew)

I would REALLY like to see something "official" (ie. usable by
most Traveller players, not just my own house rules) on this.
I suspect many "old" Traveller players will be making their
own house rules on this point also, and the more everybody\'s house
rules are in line with the published rules, the more usable
published designs are for everybody.

"Why MERC:2000?....because our customers wanted it"
    --Loren Wiseman, Merc:2000 designers notes (possibly slightly
                        misquoted, but not much)

The Traveller customers are wanting.

Well, I\'d stick Tom Peters right up there in to top bits, and follow him up
by Rob Caswell (who I understand isn\'t doing SF art anymore) and Blair
Reynolds (who I can\'t seem to find within the borders of the US). I like the
old Keith brother\'s stuff - although I tend to like the previous artists a
little better these days. I really like Blair\'s figures and aliens.

I have reviewed T:TNE rules and I can not find any movemnt penalty for
charaters carring equipment up to there load  level (did I miss anything?).

For example a Character carrying up to 36Kg (79.2 lbs), with a STR and CON of 6
each, moves as fast as  as when he is carrying no equipment.  I spent 12 years
in the Infantry and I know life doesn\'t work that way.

I don\'t know the exact errata fix for this but maybe the following:  Any amount
over 1.5 x (STR + CON) in Kg. carried requires the expenditure of 1 fatigue
point per combat turn to run (trot and slower no penalty).

I\'d be interested in hearing your thoughts.

    'body' => '          How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Virus:

     Okay.  I\'ve read _Survival Margin_.  I\'ve read _Arrival
Vengeance_.  I\'ve read _Hard Times_, the Rebellion sourcebook,
and the New Era rulebook.
     And somehow I\'m still not convinced that destroying
thousands of (albeit imaginary) worlds and killing trillions of
(admittedly notional) sophonts is the right way to go about
revising your rules system.
     Like many of the people on this list, I\'m a bit
uncomfortable with the Virus.  Here\'s why:

     I *like* the Third Imperium.  I agree with Strephon:  "Shall
not perish...shall not perish."  The idea of a community of
autonomous worlds, each free to chart its own path under the
umbrella of a benevolent Imperium, is an attractive one to me.
     The Rebellion Era background, it seems to me, is informed to
a large extent by the American Civil War.  By that I mean:  the
issue, ultimately, is in both cases to decide the fundamental
nature of a federal government "conceived in liberty".
     That may sound like a boring question, but it really isn\'t.
The workings of government are the game mechanics of freedom, if
I may be excused for drawing such a metaphor.  They\'re important.
     Unleashing the Virus put the brakes on how that issue gets
resolved, in our fictional Traveller universe at least.  And
that\'s an unsatisfying resolution to a rather dramatic story.

     "But who won?" one asks.
     "Oh," says GDW.  "Nobody.  Everybody dies at the end."

     Dave Nilsen (I think) has Dr. Kuligaan seemingly argue in
_Survival Margin_ that to resolve the Rebellion in victory or
compromise would be to fool (imaginary Traveller universe)
humanity into believing that it could routinely walk along the
brink of the abyss without plunging over.
     So to make this point absolutely clear, the logic seems to
be, we have to kill *practically everyone* in Charted Space and
send most of the rest back into the Stone Age.  I dunno.  I think
there may be a better way to make PCs, at least, understand how
high the stakes are.
     Because the question of how to best rule 11,000 worlds
hasn\'t been resolved, and seems to be part of what drives
the RCES\' Star Vikings and the Regency, with its newer, more
democratic institutions.  But the Virus isn\'t necessary for
either of those.  The Regency was already isolated "behind the
Claw" by vargr corsairs, and the Wilds existed as early as
1125--the Reformation Coalition could have begun as one of Chuck
Gannon\'s "emergent autonomous polities".
     The only thing you really have to wait for is whatever it is
from Project Longbow that\'s closing in at lightspeed on "Meridian
78, Prime Radial" (where ever that may be).  My guess is that
it\'s the 57th Century\'s equivalent of the telegraph.  Sub-space
radio, anyone?  Let\'s see...90 years plus 1115 is...1205.  Not
much longer, now.  I guess all those years in cold sleep will be
worth it, after all.
     My prediction is that it will be a technological fix that
will solve the problems of governance that plagued Strephon,
Dulinor, and the rest of the leaders of the Shattered Imperium,
and make a reformed New Imperium possible in the official GDW
future history.
     My point is simply that the Virus is extraneous to the drama
that was being played out in the Traveller universe 1117-1130,
and in fact detracts from it, IMHO, and that\'s why I dislike it.  If I
took too long to say so, I apologize.  I would appreciate
whatever comments anyone cares to make, even it\'s just an "Oh,
shut up."

 There are two articles about Imperial law--Law In The Imperium in
 Challenge 50 and Imperial Law in MegaTraveller Journal 4.  I haven\'t looked
 at either in a while but I believe that the MOJ is talked about in the
 Challenge article.

>Law & government level type in the starport

 In Far & Away 1 the article The Complete Starport says that the local
 law and government types within the starport is derived from the
 interstellar authorty.

>Starport tech level

 I don\'t remember where but I did read that the minimum tech level for any
 class A or B port is 10.

If my players want to buy an item that is at a higher TL than the planets I
look at the starmap and find the highest TL within a jump3 and that is the
highest TL they can buy.  I also charge a higher price and add shipping
charges and sales tax.

I have the Scouts enforce a law that you cannot bring any item that is 3 TL\'s
higher than the planet; outside the starport of course.

  Re-  Bill White\'s comments on The Virus

    A round of applause from this corner, I think you put your finger on
   another reason the virus felt wrong. I also liked the Rebellion (but then
   again, plenty of old Traveller players didn\'t, and said they would never
   use the new background and rules- history tends to repeat itself :) )
   and stopping it  dead (and a half) with the virus was a bit of a anti-
   climax, especially since the virus only came along *because the Rebellion
   failed to sell* - rather like those big disasters that come along in soap
   operas when the viewers start disapearing (Traveller 90210?)
    Anyway, here is a question for all those sad people who remember MT and
   maybe joined HIWG when it\'s brief was to detail the course of the Rebellion.
    The question is- What would have been the course of the Rebellion if the
                     virus had never been created? (discuss)
    This is not something that was ever decided (to my knowledge)- for example
    the original post-rebellion map indicated the destruction of Margarets(sp)
    faction, but their HIWG supporters persuaded GDW that they were in too
    good a position for this to occur. Another reason for the virus?- with no
    plan for the Rebellion it was just getting too big to handle.
     So do people think that- 1) does Lucan roll over the Third Imperium
                              2) do the Solomani land on Capital?
                              3) do the K\'Kree take over the Universe?arrghh
     ....any suggestions?

                    ----

  Oh, and just to prove I\'m not an old stick-in-the-mud, yes I have got FF&S,
  and it looks quite good. (not Traveller though- Fusion Gun Ammo?)
   Just a few notes for people making the consumer choice- HEPlaR or Thruster?

   1. take a 1 ton vehicle, with a HEPlaR drive and 1MW power source (note that
      FFS says that Fusion ISN\'T needed- we\'ll use TL15 Ever-Ready.)

   2  Run the drive for one second

   3. The power plant has produced 1 MJ of energy. The vehicle, however, is
      now moving at 200 m/s, and has energy of about 20 MJ. And then they dare
      to explain why Thruster Plates are against the laws of physics.

      ie. Thruster plates require no more suspension of disbelief than HEPlaR
         (OK- this only proves that HEPlaR is a Fusion drive, but I find both
          means of propulsion equally improbable)

   And if you DO use thruster plates, remember that HEPlaR is 10 TIMES more
   efficient per ton of drive, at 2/1000th the cost, with power being cheaper
   than thrusters at high TL, it is actually more weight and price efficient
   to use HEPlaR for short (a day or two) duration vehicles.
   I might use HEPlaR after all...

   One minor quibble (pedantic, moi?)- on page 64 it says that Fusion has only
    been achieved in H-Bombs... not exactly right. That whole Fusion section
    was useless- it didn\'t help illustrate how *Traveller* fusion reactors
    might work.(Not that anyone knows)

   And finally- I like the TNE jump fuel rules; the only part of Classic Trav
   I could never accept was that ships automatically emptied their fuel tanks
   every jump. The new rules also make large jump drives more efficient,
   an interesting change.
                       Off to see the Magistrate...

Partial Quote Follows:
"Combat Engineer (Engineer-CON): This skill alows the construction and
demolition of obsticals, minefields, and field fortifications, and the ability
to enhance mobility by building temporary bridges, ramps, and causeways across
or around natural obsticals."

In the American Army a Division, about15,000 troops, has one Battalion, about
850 troops, of Combat Engineers.   They are very handy on both the offensive
and defensive.  For Traveller, it is always nice to have a character that knows
how to blow things up.

    'body' => '  Mr. White\'s opinions on the Virus and the New Era background in general were
very thought-provoking. Of course, he is entitled to his opinion, and it isn\'t
my intent to change those opinions (I doubt if I could anyway), but to present
some of my own on the New Era background.
  I will certainly agree that the Third Imperium was a wonderful background for
a science-fiction roleplaying campaign; one needs only look at some other SFRPG
to see how widely it\'s been imitated. One nice thing about this is that if one
still desires to use that background, one can.  GDW owns Traveller, and they
can of course do whatever they like with the published background-but once YOU
buy the game, you can do whatever YOU want with it. If you feel that the saga
of the Third Imperium should have a different ending, then it can.
Hopefully, GDW will realize that a lot of others feel this way, and when the
New Era materials have been established, will put out sourcebooks for those who
prefer to game within the confines of the Imperium.
  That being said, I must say that throughout the original Traveller writings,
I always had a feeling that the Imperium was stretched to it\'s limits, and was
in danger of the very thing that happened to it with the Rebellion. The vast
areas that needed to be governed, and the vast diversity of interests which
were present in Imperial Space virtually assured that the Imperium would fail
in a major way someday. While Virus and it\'s effects may not have been part of
a master plan (if indeed there was one, whether by Marc Miller or someone else)
it always seemed to me that the disintegration of the Imperium was virtually
assured. I think it\'s important to point out that a careful reading of Hard
Times points out that the Third Imperium died long before the Virus. Virus
trashed interstellar civilization as a whole, not just what was left of the
Imperium.
  The AI Virus was an act of desperation, somewhat akin to the fears that
people had that the Soviets might have a "doomsday device" which they would use
to destroy civilization on Earth should they be losing a war. The fact that it
was set off by Dulinor rather than Lucan is immaterial; it was still Lucan\'s
doomsday device, although he didn\'t intend it to be. Catastrophes happen. Not
all stories are allowed to proceed to a logical conclusion. The very act of
conceiving of the Virus proved that Lucan, like all the other factions in the
Rebellion, was thinking only of his agenda. ARRIVAL VENGEANCE clearly showed
that there was no hope of ever reuniting the Imperium. The logical conclusion
to the story would have been that a series of squabbling interstellar states
would have settled into place, and that somewhere down the line, someone would
have tried to unite them, with a huge war which would have killed trillions.
The Virus, whether by accident or by Hiver design, as some have suggested, has
wiped the slate clean, teaching humanity an abject lesson and hopefully making
sure that the state which replaces the Imperium will be better governed.
  Or maybe that should be states! The Regency will eventually begin expanding
outward, and will run into the Reformation Coalition at some point. It\'s been
hinted in CHALLENGE that there will be a supplement dealing with this. When
they meet, they may make bitter war at first. Eventually they may become like
the United States and England are now, because despite some differences, they
both beleive in the same thing; the importance of returning humanity to the
stars, and the fundamental rights of all beings. Whereas one mighty Imperium
couldn\'t rule the stars effectively, two smaller but allied powers just might
be able to make it work.
  I too like the Third Imperium; I also like the New Era. That\'s why I run in
both. As gamemaster, I can keep or throw out whatever I like. If you like the
Imperium, and wish to extend it\'s history beyond 1116 or 1130, by all means
do so.
    Sorry about the length; I guess I had more to say than I thought.

The aldersen Drive could be discribed as a Jump Drive.
Probebly Jamp-4 or 5 ?.. not sure.  and the Black
Globe thing, well I don\'t think it\'s the same as in
Traveller, but a nice device indeed.

Are you planing on running a campaign based on
Mote\'s in god\'s eye?

As you said in your own answer, much of this will be dependent upon that
planet\'s relations with the Imperium. Some will be like the city/county/state/
federal hierarchy of the modern US; others may actively resent Imperial
"meddling" and either stall or negotiate their dealings with the Imperium;
depending on a criminal\'s crime, he may be welcomed (secretly) by members
of certain worlds! But generally, I think local laws, including ordinances
mandated by the Imperium, will be enforced by the local constabulary, with
the Imperium retaining the right to arrest criminals who have broken Imperial
law elsewhere (whether offworld or in space).

I think extradition between worlds (i.e, you run a stoplight at Matewan
and flee to Jamaica but the Imperium has no rule against running stoplights)
will not involve the Imperium except in unusual circumstances (hostility
between worlds, for instance)

>Q: If the law & government level describes the world outside the starport,
>what determines what is the law level and government type -in- the
>starport?

I\'ve always taken them to be inclusive of the starport, and assumed that
starports (but not naval bases and the like) fell under the purview of
the local planetary or stellar government.

>Q: If you assume the UWP is describing the world and not the starport, what
>tech level should the starports be?

Again, I find it easier to put them at world TL; if that is not high enough
for the construction of a starport, make it the minimum needed.

Don\'t be silly. If I gave a fusion gun and you have bows and arrows, who\'s
going to stop me from going wherever I want. (flippant answer).

Seriously though, this will again be dependent upon the world. I believe that
many worlds allow people to walk around with their own equipment, 1) to
encourage trade and 2) it\'s too difficult to keep all that stuff out. Granted,
in many instances there will be provisions regarding high-tech assault weaponry
(the aforementioned fusion gun) which will likely be prohibited anyway, and
enforced (if need be) with specialized paramilitary units or by petitioning
the Imperium to enforce the law. Whatever the case, however, I believe it
will be different from planet to planet.

>What does a Combat Enginner do?..  Could you discribe the skill a bit?

Combat Engineers construct platforms, dig embankments, build bridges, and
create other structures and fortification in a battle area. They also destroy
said structures.

Such a skill would involve rudimentary knowledge of demolitions, structural/
civil engineering, and possibly mining (they started out as diggers who built
tunnels beneath castle fortifications, and later moved to constructing
earthen embankments that could withstand the recoil of early field artillery).

Ah, but how does one initiate commands in say, a word processor? I think a
small unit consisting perhaps of nothing but control/alt/delete will be
neccesary so that the computer knows you want to "save" a document, not add
word "save" to it.

>Granted there will probably be limits to miniturizing computers but smaller
>devices than currently present in official rules are within reason.

Essentially, the control devices will mass more than the processors themselves,
except in the case of neural implants. Maybe in the future the computer will
be carried from point to point, plugging them into whichever peripheral is
handy.

Yes.  It was called "The Gripping Hand" in the US I believe, and "The Moat

It\'s pretty good as a sequel, but of course like pretty much all sequels
it\'s not nearly as good as the original.

   The test design Frank worked up differs from yours in minor

  not TL-8.

   As a side note, the TL-5 .357 magnum revolver I designed

  length, weapon mass, etc...only ammo mass was off by a bit.

Yes!  It\'s call the "Gripping Hand" and it\'s out on paper back.  I
personally perfer the original but GH is still quite good.

I thought the Alderson Drive is more like the Wormhole drive mentioned
in FF&S.  Specifically the closed type.  You right in that the
principle for the Lanston Field is different than the Black
Globe...but I always though if it quacks and walks like a duck, it\'s a
duck.

Also I think the "mote"\'s universe haven\'t mastered control of gravity
yet.

Good Luck!

I see we\'ve abandoned reality in the rules again. First I see the post
about the HEPLAR drive violating the conservation of energy. Then I see
Loren\'s post regarding the 1 kw required for a 60 km range on a radio.

Let\'s hit the radio first. Loren stays that the 60km is "short" range,
and that the range bands double until you reach extreme range at 240 km.
Sorry, but that won\'t work.  Amatuer radio operators are limited to 1
kw. And they *routinely* achieve "planetary" range at *AND BELOW* those
power levels. A *5* watt CB can routinely achieve 30 km ranges, given a
decent antenna. And when "skip" is a dactor, they can make
intercontinental contacts (not reliably though!).

So *two* changes need to be made for radio. First, the power levels
need to go *down*, or the ranges need to go up. Second, somewhere
between 20 and 100 MHZ, the signals quit bouncing off the ionosphere (if
the planet has one). At that point, range is *restricted* to
line-of-sight. Below it, you can reach whatever range you have the power
for. Oh yeah, the amount of interference has a *major* effect on
*usable* range. :-)

Now for the drive problem. This is a twofold problem also. Reaction drives give 
a vehicle velocity by imparting velocity to reaction mass, which goes in the
  other direction. So a constant power input gives a constant exhaust velocity, 
and a constant acceleration.

Reactionless drives are converting power plant energy into kinetic
energy (via some sort of magic, as this violates a couple of
conservation laws). But the problem here is that kinetic energy is
proportional to the velocity *squared*. So the amount of energy that it
takes to go from 100 m/s to 200 m/s is 4 times that required to go from
0 to 100 m/s. That means that you *can\'t* get a sustained acceleration
at a constant power output!

If you can convert power plant energy directly to *momentum*, then you
could get a constant acceleration from a constant input energy. But
you\'d be breaking more laws.

Here\'s the kinetic energy of 1 ton at various speeds:

m/s     MJ
- ---- ----
100       5
200      20
300      45
400      80
500     125
600     180
700     245
800     320
900     405
1e3     500

For a reaction drive, the acceleration is equal to:

sqrt(2*(power plant output)*(drive efficiency)/(mass of ship))

So a 1 megawatt plant in a 1 ton hull with a 100% efficient drive
will give:

Sqrt(2*1e6*1/1e3)=44.7 m/s^2 of acceleration.

That\'s about 4.6 gravities.

With a nore reasonable drive effieciency, things drop rapidly. (You *don\'t* 
want to know what the efficiency of an internal combustion engine is. :-)

  The Solomani have the largest single government in Human space.
  Furthermore, there is a high level of popular support for the
  "reliberation" of areas "occupied" by the former Imperium.  The
  capture of Terra provides a much-needed morale boost to the
  Solomani, with the result that there is less internal dissent
  making itself felt.  Solomani irredentist societies are being
  formed throughout the "occupied" area, and are major players in
  planetary governments in Old Expanses.  Further Solomani gains
  can be expected.  There are two problem locations for the
  Solomani:  Muan Gwi, where mistreatment under Solomani domination
  is almost a racial memory among the Vegans, and Daibei under Duke
  Craig.  Craig is a comparatively charismatic leader, and he has
  shown that he intends to lead the people of the Federation of
  Daibei in a viable direction.  The Solomani cannot have the
  example of a successful former Imperial state on their borders;
  too many of the "reliberated" areas might start getting ideas.
  If the situation in the Old Expanses can be stabilized, a major
  effort against Duke Craig is inevitable.  With no allies, Duke
  Craig will either have to fight to the death (of his state), or
  reach an "accommodation" that would leave him merely the titular
  ruler of Daibei as a Solomani Client State (or perhaps
  Protectorate, putatively against future aggression from Ilelish
  or the Aslan), and would also force him to abandon the Vegans
  (part of any treaty would be that he is to close his borders to
  Vegan "terrorists").  It is unlikely (despite Solomani
  representations to Craig) that the Aslan would choose to become
  militarily involved in this area unless provoked, and the
  Solomani know that they cannot take on the entire Hierate.
  Similar concerns with respect to the Hive Federation will exist,
  though here, it would be more a concern with higher technology
  and psychohistorical manipulation (Naively, the Solomani believe
  that they are not being targeted for manipulation at this time.
  The Hivers have not and will not reveal anything, either way).
  Look for an increasingly militant Solomani Confederation, though
  one that will be increasingly paralyzed by internal debate as the
  "occupied" areas are "reliberated" and the decision must be made
  as to whether to expand further into Human space, or to start
  worrying about the "alien problem."

  Summary:      Regency:        See New Era, but no sealed borders.
                Core:           Increased tyranny, no fundamental
                                changes.
                Ilelish:        As Core, though the Verge Combine is
                                something of a wild card.
                Usdiki:         Non-issue.  Eventual absorption by
                                Ilelish.
                Ziru Sirkaa:    Eventual stasis and dry rot, behind
                                borders strong enough to hold off
                                Ilelish and Core while they play
                                with each other.
                Antares:        Balkanization, with Human worlds
                                being absorbed by Julian
                                Protectorate and Core, and Vargr
                                worlds balkanizing further.  Those
                                that survive the race wars, anyway.
                Delphi:         Stability until one of the other
                                factions or the Solomani come
                                calling.  Accommodation probable,
                                rather than fight to the death.
                Daibei:         Too dangerous (as an idea) to the
                                Solomani.  Bye-bye, as soon as
                                they can divert enough attention
                                from Delphi and Old Expanses.
                Solomani:       Continued expansion to the "real"
                                borders, followed by internal
                                paralysis over the Alien Problem.

  Other matters:  Since we don\'t know what the Black Curtain is, or
  what caused it, no comment on whether it even exists.  The
  "border incident" with the K\'kree is played down; neither side
  really wants a full-scale war.  Instead, the Government of the
  Two Thousand Worlds quashes the splinter state that sent the
  mission (see Lords of Thunder [I think...]).  We had an inkling
  that the Zhodani were having problems of their own; they still
  are in the revised history, but we don\'t know any more on this
  timeline than we did on the other.  Strephon and Norris are still
  the sole "custodians" of JumpStart and Longbow; we know no more
  about them than we did before.

  I see it as follows:  In no particular order:

  After the assassination of Bzrk in Antares, the cohesiveness of
  the factional society would have disappeared, and local
  infighting would have become the order of the day.  With racist
  organizations on all sides, both Vargr and Human, massacres and
  race wars would have been common, and eventually, there would
  have been "Vargr" and "Human" worlds.  Shortly thereafter, the
  Vargr worlds would balkanized the way Lishun sector did, and the
  Human worlds would have been absorbed into either the Julian
  Protectorate or Lucan\'s Imperium (Referred to hereafter as the
  Core Tyranny, or just Core).

  The Ziru Sirkaa (ZS) would have continued to concentrate on
  consolidating its hold and forming secure borders.  With Core
  attempting to absorb Antares, there would have been a reduction
  in border incidents between the ZS and Core.  By the time that
  Core was ready to turn its attention to the ZS, the ZS would have
  been able to hold them off, and a long war of attrition would
  have started.  Within the ZS, the Vilani mind set would become
  well-established, and the ZS would sink into the "dry husk"
  stasis that allowed the dynamic Terran Confederation to triumph
  over the original Ziru Sirka.

  The Regency (which still would have been called that internally;
  recall the Arrival Vengeance mission) would be much the same as
  it is today.  More open borders would have been the case (no
  virus fear), but the same kind of multiracial rapprochement
  between the area Vargr, Aslan, and various Human states
  (including the Zhodani Consulate) would likely have occurred -
  strictly in the name of economic self-interest.  After the Vargr,
  Zhodani, and Aslan Ihatei situations were stabilized, an effort
  to reopen Corridor, and contact with the ZS would have been the
  next step.  A push for spinward exploration would be unlikely, as
  it would provoke the Zhodani (recall the reasons for the Frontier
  Wars).

  Strephon\'s Imperium (Future references: Usdiki) was already of no
  consequence, and the Arrival Vengeance mission made it clear (at
  least to the Regency government) that Strephon had in fact
  abdicated from the throne.  I believe that a small principality,
  under the Marquis of Usdiki, would have survived until either
  Core or (more likely) Dulinor\'s Imperium ("Ilelish") turned its
  attention to it.

  Ilelish is having its own problems.  A continuing war of
  attrition with Core (across the wilds, and therefore both sides
  will also have to contend with renegades and "pirates"), plus
  internal problems with the so-called Verge Combine, limit its
  ability to cause mischief.  If the Verge situation is controlled,
  Ilelish is most likely to clean up the loose end at Usdiki next.
  Like Lucan in Core, Dulinor in Ilelish will become increasingly
  more autocratic and tyrannical, and for the same reasons.  The
  only real difference is that Lucan is additionally of
  questionable sanity.  The Coronation Fleet expedition did make it
  to the Research Station at which Virus was being developed, but
  Lucan had enough force there to fight off the Coronation Fleet,
  and Dulinor, knowing that he would have to face further battles
  on his way to Core, elected instead to turn back.  In the process
  of attempting to break through the Core forces, the Research
  Station was destroyed, and the Virus project was abruptly
  terminated, and set at nought.

  Duke Craig (Daibei) is not a factor in Ilelish calculations.  An
  arm of the Rift separates the two factions, and a much more
  pressing matter to Daibei is the Solomani Confederation, and the
  influx of refugees from Muan Gwi (the Vegan Autonomous District).
  This will be further addressed in the Solomani outline.

  Margaret\'s concentration on "making the trains run on time" will
  prove to be her undoing.  Concentrating on strictly economic
  development, without regard for human rights and dignity, and
  having no "head" for military or intelligence policies will put
  her at a severe disadvantage with respect to the Solomani,
  Ilelish, and Core.  Additionally, she does not have the strong
  loyal following that Dulinor and Lucan have, because she is not
  as public a figure.  The general perception seems to be that
  Delphi is ruled by committee.  The Solomani annexation of Old
  Expanses places a threat on that front; trade with the Hivers
  through newly developed routes in the Hinterworlds furthers her
  economic goals, but does nothing to relieve the military threat
  of the Solomani.  Expect Delphi to either fall to or reach an
  "accommodation" with the Solomani.

Actually, it IS possilbe to get non-line-of-sight signals reliably
through at frequencies around 4-5 GHz.  The effect is known as
troposcatter.  The US Army uses this for medium range multi-channel
radio shots.  Typical ranges are in the 50 to 200 mile range.  For
up to around 50, the Army uses line-of-sight radios, and above this
range, the Army uses satellites.

It is very true that interference has a vast impact on ranges.  Another
factor influencing range is terrain.  In Desert Storm, the Army
discovered they could get longer ranges out of their line-of-sight
radios than it was rated for when used over the sand.

I do agree with you that for the radios listed, the power consumption
is way too high.  The highest power radio the Army uses is the Tropo
radios.  Those have a power consumption in the 1-2 kW range.  All
other radios are less than that.

One of these days, when I get time and get settled in my new house,
I\'ll try to organize some of the information I have on Army radios
and send it out.

Subject: Traveller NewsPaper

I have been thinking of producing a \'newspaper\' as a prop for my Traveller
Campaign. Aside from putting in TNS articles from Challenge and JTAS, I\'d
like to include such things as a Positions Vacant (job advertisements) and
Jobs Wanted (people advertising their skills) column.

Any suggestions on content, format, production etc appreciated.

I\'d also appreciate material for inclusion.

If anyone would like to post me what they think would be a good sample
advertisement I can include that. An advert offering the services of one of
your favourite PCs, or NPCs, or a job advert that you might like to see in
a Traveller game (jokes accepted, but serious adverts would be nice) are
suggestions. Patron descriptions along the lines of 76 Patrons would also
be ok.

If I manage to produce an edition I\'ll post it to the list. Just think - If
1 in 10 lurkers produced 1 item I\'d probably be swamped with material -
which if you post to the list rather than just me direct, everyone can take
advantage of.

Subject: TV series question

I recently started a \'GURPS Traveller-esque\' adventure which had characters
being agents for an intelligence agency. As a change, a more flamboyant
atmosphere was requested. So, based on an American TV series whose name we
can\'t remember, the team is posing as a group of models and photographers.

The question is: what is the name of the TV series. All we can remember
about it is the female lead ran this group of models, and the male lead who
was pretending to be a model was ex-army or something. They basically
operated in Europe rescuing Americans who had gotten themselves into
trouble and so on.

I think the male lead was the actor John Eric Hexum(sp?), who accidentally
killed himself with a gun loaded with blanks.
- ----
Now, the typical work and lifestyle of models and journalists are not areas
I have a great deal of knowledge on. Any suggestions on typical work
activities and for appropriate plot ideas taking advantage of this setup
would be -greatly- appreciated.  Or good source material (books, films,
etc).

In response to the idea about a Traveller Newspaper and the kinds of ads
that you would put in, I suggest you check the Journal of Commerce for
examples of ship listings.  My father used this when he would look for
ships to carry cargos.  I haven\'t looked at it in a long time, but I
remember the listings were heavily abbreviated (like auto ads for instance).

Good luck, and why not post the results of your first effort to the list?!

The plot idea for journalists are limitless. covering stories for a
newspaper tend to make the reporter chase one lead after another.
There are plenty of examples in mystery novels. Model is a bit more
difficult, a friend of mine is a model. She travels frequently for
photo shoots. It will give the character a lot of oppunity to travel,
perhaps he/she runs arcoss something during the travel.

Hi All,

I was looking over CT material as I prepared to code a set of Traveller
Utilities when I realized I\'ve misunderstood some things for years. I was under
the impression that Jump Drives "worked" by storing huge amounts of energy in
zuchai crystals and releasing it to enter jump space. The only fuel needs seemed
to be that which the powerplant required to generate the huge amount of energy.

Then I noticed in High Guard under the section on Black Globes, page 43

"If a ship absorbs enough energy to make a jump, and is supplied with
sufficient fuel, it may jump at the end of the turn."

Why is additional fuel required? How much is needed? I never noticed this before
because I never used Black Globes that much. I figure that someone who has
gamed with TCS has to have encountered this at some point.

It seems as though you have to pay twice. Does anybody know why?

TTFN

the Gripping Hand or the other name?

umm.. a wormhole.  my impresion from the book was that it
 seemed more like a jump drive, dunno..  maybe you\'re
right.  about Black Globe: yeah, it\'s close enough :)

I have a question for you, do you remember if in the book
there discussed about the kind of ships that the Motes had?
like what it was made of ?.. i don\'t seem to remember.

I would like to try to design one :)

He went on to say how he liked Reynolds\' aliens.

Blair\'s MT art came as a surprise to me.  I was more familiar with
his current topic.  Blair\'s been doing Cthulhu art for a magazine called
"Unspeakable Oath" by Pagan Publishing: if you like Call of Cthulhu, I can\'t
recomend this magazine enough.  According to UO, Blair lives in Alaska,
and sends his friends at PP frozen dogs heads.  See the mag for more details.

His Cthulhu stuff is some of the most gruesome, revolting (read best) horror
artwork I\'ve seen in awhile.  I liked his Traveller stuff too ;-)

PS-- I second the vote for Donna Barr as a great Traveller artist, but I
think most of her time is being taken up by The Desert Peach, a comic about the
Desert Fox\'s gay brother.  She did a musical on this topic, too.

Alternate traveller timelines:
Here\'s the one I was going to go with, but have now discarded:
1119 Antares re-allies with Julian Protectorate to form a new
republican federation (Coreward Federal Republic). Brzk is elected
first president with little opposition. The Menderes Corp granted a
series of federal monopolies to keep them quiet.
1120 Margaret concludes pact with Dulinor. Her domain emerges as a
Hiver client state - the Hive is attempting to establish a stable
buffer state to protect military and trade interests between the hive
and the Imperium.
1121 Military coup in Illelish. Dulinor assassinated. "Pact of Dlan"
brings together CFR, Daibei, Margaret, Vland, Illelish, Gushemege and
Core factions to agree ceasefire. Verge is reincorporated into
Illelish.
1121 Daibei overrun by new Solomani push. Craig disappears. Solomani
agree border with key Aslan clans in return for land grants in the new
Daibei and Reaver\'s Deep territories. The Aslan are effectively given
those worlds with the largest non-human minor race populations to use
as they wish. In return for the peaceful concession of Daibei, the
Solomani agree terms - "Peace of Terra" - for ceasefire with remaining
factions, basically legitimising wartime gains. The entirety of Daibei,
Reaver\'s Deep and the Rim, along with Diaspora and the Old Expanses as
far as the old Solomani border are ceded to the Confederation.
1122 new Zhodani core expedition
1122 Deneb joins the Pact of Dlan. The treaty is extended to seek
agreement on the reunification of the Imperium, possibly under a
successor to Lucan. All parties except Vland agree to abide by the
conclusions. Two years of relative peace see Vland, Deneb and the CFR
force back Vargr forces in Lishun and Corridor.
1124 Gushemege falls to Lucan\'s reconstructed Vengeance Fleet.
Strephon disappears. Pact of Dlan collapses. Margaret agrees private
terms with Lucan. Remaining factions (CFR, Vland, Illelish and Deneb)
unite to declare renewed war on Lucan.
1124 partial return of Solomani home expeditions with word of a new
major race with a vast empire two sectors spinward of the hierate.
1126 Pact fleets retake Capital. Lucan flees but is found and killed by
bounty hunters some weeks later. "Pact of Kashuggus" establishes a
Fourth Imperium consisting of Lucan\'s remaining possessions, Illelish,
and Gushemege under the commander of the Illelish forces. Vland, CFR
and Deneb acquire their independence. Margaret declines to join the new
Imperium, and her domain becomes a semi-autonomous region of the Hiver
Federation.
worlds are barely sustainable, and the remaining powers are in no
economic condition to repair them. The results: a massive refugee
problem; piracy; general economic collapse. There are relatively rich
and safe areas around Capital and Dlan, but they are all the more
resented for that. On the other hand, the CFR, Vland, Deneb, Delphi and
the Solomani Confederation are all fairly stable, albeit quite
distinct. Each of them is primarily occupied with reconstruction,
especially the Solomani, whose political rifts are becoming more and
more pronounced. Oh, and:
1125 A ship misjumps into the Palasha system, Massilia. All the crew
are dead, and half of them were Hivers. Transponders and flight
documentation indicate the craft is set off from Usdiki in 1124, bound
for Glea. Further investigation indicates that the human crew are IRIS
agents. In the hold is a highly sophisticated pseudo-biological robot,
with the features of the late emperor Strephon ....

Why discard it? I decided to stay with the GDW program ... The intro to
Survival margin implies a fairly stable political arrangement 60 years
after the Star Vikings; I\'m hoping that GDW sees the light and
publishes at least SOME details of that stage of the timeline by the
time that the Virus hits my campaign. Any guesses, anyone, on what
happens next?

Alastair\'s TV question:
the series was Cover Up, according to a colleague at work ... the theme
tune was Bonnie Tyler/Jim Steinman "What I Need is a Hero" (or
something like that) and Hexum was replaced by his (Australian) best
mate after he accidentally shot himself.

Finally:
Picked up FFS at the weekend. Am I mistaken, or were there not meant to
be rules for robot design? And they\'re not there?

I couldn\'t manage to pass up an opportunity to reply to
William White\'s thoughtful post.  Thank you, William; you\'ve
made one of the most intelligent and reasonable posts that
I have ever seen on the New Era / Virus issue.

And it\'s one of the more important and thoughtful questions that Traveller
has ever raised.  And this from a game that has, like it\'s source material,
Science-Fiction literature, frequently addressed moral issues that many
games ignore.

Early role-playing games had built-in black and white morality: The PCs were
Lawful Good, and the bad guys were Evil, so it was OK to slice and dice them
on sight.  Traveller was one of the first games to break away from that mold
entirely, and present a universe that had as many shades of gray as the
referee and the players were prepared to deal with.

Even within the confines of the Third Imperium, there was a great variation
on what level of detail you could play at, and what kind of universe you
played in.  You could explore issues from animal testing (Research Station
Gamma) to saving the whales (Nomads of the World Ocean) and from meddling in
the affairs of worlds for fun and profit (Divine Intervantion) to saving
worlds from ecological disaster - like it or not (Chamax Plague/Horde).

And then a very interesting question was posed: What holds the Imperium
together?  How do you govern something that large?

"Nothing holds it together", or "You can\'t".

Not very dramatic, and not very heroic.  And there\'s nothing that the PCs
can do about it.  While Dominic Flandry\'s ultimate goal, holding the Terran

To continue the Civil War metaphor you introduced above, the American Civil
War showed the people of the United States that they can routinely walk the
abyss?  I don\'t think so.  Did the fact that the Jews, as a people, survived
a monster like Adolf Hitler mean that we should be willing to allow another
such madman to come to power?  I sincerely hope not (although the current
Balkan situation is enough to make me pause before I say that).

In the Traveller universe, the Third Imperium was the greatest social
construct Humaniti had ever created.  The Rebellion was the greatest blow it
had ever been dealt.  Had some faction won, had Avery Alkhalikoi re-united
the Third Imperium in 1160, the effects of the Rebellion, even without the
Virus, would still be felt for hundreds of years.  Like in similar conflicts
before, the horror and bloodshed would be enough to remind humaniti: "Never
Again".

Are you sure about this last?  When I read the Star Vikings material, I see
an interstellar government that is *LESS* tolerant that the Imperium.
According to Traveller: The New Era, worlds that survived the Crash have had
to embrace the Leader Principle: a government, typically a charismatic
leader who makes the hard decisions, and is willing to implement them for
the good of all of the people.

 The
The Reformation coalition thinks nothing of toppling governments that it
doesn\'t approve of, or institutions that could become potential obstructions
to it\'s expansion plans.

Note the "could become" - a government or institution doesn\'t actually have
to be malignant before it is removed.  It can even "... do a lot of good
 ..." and "... be successful in moderating the worst excesses of the local
warlords ..." or "... be quite popular with the people ...".  It would still
need removing, if it is in the way of "... an ideal site for establishment
of a RCES hub base ...".

It\'s also worth noting that the toppling of governments and institutions is
so routine and accepted within the Reformation Coalition that these
decisions are not made, or quite possible even discussed, at the top level.
A relatively small staff, operating out of a planning bureau, can order up
such missions relatively informally.  To put this into perspective, it\'s as
if the U.S. military operation had been undertaking without the knowledge or
approval of the President, but instead on the authority of a Marine Lt.
Colonel operating on a planning committee somewhere.

I\'m currently working on several FF&S spreadsheet for Quattro Pro

for design of lift vehicles and ground vehicles.  I can try to port
it over to Lotus or Excel format.  But I incorporate grapics (lines

well those will go through.

BTW I don\'t use gravitic focusing for the laser designs.  I\'ll
include an explaination with the upload if it ever gets to that

It\'s like a Wormhole mainly because it\'s a \'geographic\' element
in that universe.  The Jump Drive will allow one to go FLT anytime
they\'re 100+ diameter out.  But with a Wormhole drive one gotta
find the \'hold\' and open it...much like the Alderson Drive.

I recall the ship was described as some kind of metal-ceramic mix.
The drive was like a overgrown MagnetoPlasmaDynamic drive so in
FF&S it\'ll be like a Fusion rocket with a smaller danger space.

It\'s "The Mote Around Murcheson\'s Eye" here.  (Here, being the U.K., counts
as "elsewhere" in Shane\'s text. :-)  Enough other people have mentioned
"The Gripping Hand" on TML to convince me that for some reason, the U.S.A.
does indeed have a different title for the book.  As for what to look for -
take no chances, look for both! :-)

MegaTraveller: it\'s pretty good as a sequel, but of course like pretty much
all sequels it\'s not nearly as good as the original.  The same goes double
for TNE. :-)

You can only jump between specific points linking pairs of star systems with
an Alderson drive.  A jump drive works from anywhere to anywhere in range.

Customised!

> I would like to try to design one :)

Good luck!  The Moties rebuilt the thing on the fly.  A High Guard profile
of the ship would basically be a row of question marks.  If the players
got their hands on one, either because it had been abandoned or because
the Moties inside were dead (possibly as a result of interaction with the
PC\'s ;-) then you could draw up a design for its final state.  Otherwise
the ship is purely a matter of referee\'s discretion, and liable to change
at any time.

Get hold of the "Maximum Metal" supplement for Cyberpunk 2020.  It has pretty
good design rules for powered suits and I had no trouble integrating them
into my Traveller campaign.

Just be careful about what you let your players get their hands on:  The
armour that my Imperial Marines wander around in shrugs off most ammo under
20mm, and has built in a 7.62 minigun, a 30mm rifle, and an auto grenade
launcher ( among other goodies ).  And if they need more firepower they can
always carry a FGMP ( except of course that since the armour gives them
about 10x strength it can be rather larger that the average FGMP :-)

Good question.  Unfortunately the mechanics of jump drive seem to have changed
with each new generation of Traveller, and never quite got a full explanation,
with _detailed_ rules that weren\'t ambiguous.

Here\'re my house rules for CT and MT:

In order to jump, a starship must have a jump drive (high output power plant)
powered up and producing energy.  The first faze of the sequence is to divert
energy into the jump capacitors.  After the (zuchai crystal) capacitors are
fully charged (generally during the relatively low-output "power-up" cycle of
bringing the jump drive online), energy from the capacitors is shunted to the
lanthanum grid along with remaining output from the J drive.  The remaining
several (mili?)seconds of the jump initiation is sustained by the J drive
alone.

Graphically:

Chart 1 represents the output produced by the Jump drive.  Chart 2 represents
the input of energy into the lanthanum grid.  Neither is to scale, since I
postulate a lengthy "warm-up" phase.  It\'s this warm-up phase that the
black-globe rules allow you to "ignore,"  but you must still have a jump-drive
online and ready to roar (with a full [maybe 95%] fuel supply for the jump.)
In my campaigns, it\'s assumed that the drive is being brought online during the
phases previous to the jump.

In any event, it\'s all hand-waving and magic...  :)

(Especially since the MT Starship Operator\'s Manual states pretty explicitly
that this rule no longer applies.  Just goes to show that you can\'t trust an
old Vilani fart farther than you can smell him...)

My personal feeling is that capacitors were intoduced without much thought, and
that they haven\'t been exploited in standard designs enough.  (Enclosed is my

The Ape class fighter, while small in stature more than makes up for its
diminutive size with its blazing fusion gun, uncanny agility, and thick hide.

The 8 ton needle-shaped fighter is available (with slight modifications) at
tech level 12 and higher.  The fighter mounts maneuver-6 and power plant-6
which produces 0.48 energy points, providing an agility rating of 6.  Fuel
tankage is minimal, at 0.04 tons, giving a duration of 2.5 days constant
operation.  Fuel scoops allow for easy refueling, and the craft may burn
unrefined fuel directly.

Much of it\'s 20% size reduction is due to the 1.5 ton capacitor that it leeches
engergy off of in combat situations.  The capacitor can provide enough energy
to the craft\'s fusion gun for 27 turns of combat.  A missile rack rounds out
the armament.  The hull is armored to a strength of 13.

The fighter has no bridge, but does carry a Model/1 computer.  For crew, the
craft carries a pilot/gunner, requiring one couch.  As no gunner has been
provided for, the pilot may only fire one weapon at a time.

Many commanders are willing to endure this short duration in exchange for the
25% increase in guns (and the comparative strength of the fusion gun) that can
be brought against the enemy compared to conventional 10 ton fighters.

The TL 14 variety is same basic configuration, except that the armor factor
drops to 7.  The volume obtained by the reduction in armor is used to
supplement the power plant.  Double the cost of the power plant, but reduce the
cost for the armor.

The TL 13 variety is the same as the TL 14 version except that the armor factor
drops to 3, and the fusion-gun rating is reduced to 4.

The TL 12 variety is the same as the TL 13 version except that the maneuver
drive, power plant, and agility ratings are all reduced to 4, and the missile
rating is reduced to 1.  The volume obtained by the reduction in the manuever
drive is used to supplement the power plant.

Below TL 12, this class of ship just isn\'t possible...

Design notes:  As it stands, the only rules that were bent were the 1-ton
minimums on the fuel requirement, and the provision of two different weapon
types on board.

Oh yeah, the capacitor rules are on pages 31 and 42 of my edition of High
Guard (c) 1980 under the headings "Screens" and "The Black Globe",
respectively.  I think this design is a logical extension of those rules.

The US edition is definately called "The Gripping Hand" ( or possibly
"Gripping Hand" but you get the idea ).
The edition I have ( UK ) is most certainly called "The Moat around
Murcheson\'s Eye" ( which IMHO is a much better title :-) & I\'ve been
told by a usually reliable source that this is the title being used on
all non-US editions.

Your best option would be to look for it under both titles I guess.

If you can find players :-(

    And A word from Loren c/o GEnie:

GDW.SUPPORT [Loren W]        at 22:17 EST

  Announcing, the FF&S/RCEG Design Search

  GDW is seeking designs for items of equipment to be featured in
  their upcoming product, the Reformation Coalition Equipment
  Guide. This book will deal with the standard personal equipment
  of the Reformation Coalition Exploration Service, as well as the
  equipment they are likely to encounter on the various worlds they
  contact, as well as recovered Imperial equipment.

  There are, of course, some ground rules:

  1. We don\'t need very many more small arms. If you have a
  really neat gun that you think will beat out everything else
  under the sun, go ahead and submit it, but bear in mind that we
  already have designs for a great many small arms, and we are
  likely to get a lot more. This applies less to heavy weapons, tac
  missiles and such weapon systems. We are primarily looking for
  personel equipment, although small vehicles, non-starships, or
  similar designs will be considered. Likewise, we are not looking
  for starships, but we will consider non-jump spacecraft that are
  particularly interesting or innovative.

  2. All designs must use the standard Imperial campaign
  technology as described in FF&S. Designs using optional or
  alternative technologies (even though included in FF&S) cannot be
  considered. Likewise, all designs must follow the rules in FF&S
  to the letter...no house rules or variants will be acceptable.

  3. The highest tech level of the coalition is 12 (C for you
  folks who insist on alphnumerics). Equipment in the hands of
  other groups will probably be lower than this. "Remnant" Imperial
  equipment will be TLs 13 to 15 (D to F).

  4. Show your worksheets. We need to see every calculation,
  simply printing out a spreadsheet design will not be adequate, as
  we cannot always tell from such things which values you have used
  for various variables, where and when you rounded, etc. Be neat
  and legible. E-mail entries are OK, provided we can decipher
  them.

  5. The only payment you will receive is the inner sense of well-
  being resulting from a job well-done, your name on the credits
  page of the RCEG, the fawning adulation of your peers for getting
  your name in print, and a free copy of the book if we use one or
  more of your designs.

  6. If you want to send a sketch or drawing to help our
  artists illustrate your brainchild(ren) feel free. GDW\'s art staff
  is unable to decode electronic sketches, so these will have
  to be sent to us on paper...sorry.
  7. All submissions become the property of GDW, Inc., and cannot
  be returned (but we will try to acknowledge receipt of each). GDW
  reserves the right edit and/or alter any design as we deem
  necessary.

Diaspora Sector, two infolios, one that has UWP data for 1119, one for 1200,
character cords that have such info as skill by attribute, etc, and a little
gem of a booklet that changes some of the TNE equipment and weapons as
redesigned using FF&S.  All together, possible the best valued boxed set from
GDW since the original Deluxe Traveller.
The minis are superb, bringing back memories of some of the MArtian
Metals minis.  There are two ships in this pack (for $6.75 US).  Each has four
parts: the ship body, two fins, and one turret.  The minis are made of the
100% pewter stuff, not lead.  Again, they done good on this one.

Recomendations:
Deluxe T:TNE: Get it if you are going to play TNE.
Minis: Excellent.

  `The Gripping Hand\' is the title it was released under in the US.  It\'s
out in paperpack and the SF Book Club was giving it away in hardcover.
"The Moat around Murcheson\'s Eye" is the title it was released under in the

   It\'s out.  I saw it on the shelves of a local gaming store last week.
I liked the cover of the box.  It\'s the old CT boxed set cover, but ripped
(like a Christmas package) to show the TNE basic book cover beneath.

I\'ve had that idea myself. The Neubayern army is a heavy user of small mecha,
which were inspired by designs from the Bubblegum Crisis series. I posted the
two most common types to the TML a while back, in fact. However, these aren\'t
anywhere near the size of the mobile suits. To be believable, big mecha have
to have some reason to exist, be it Minovsky Particles, Zentraedi, or
whatever, and no such reason exists on Neubayern.

I\'d recommend that you design your mecha using GURPS and then convert them to
TNE. That\'s what I did with the small mecha, and it worked quite nicely. FF&S
is a good product, but it was simply never meant for mecha design. I also
recommend getting a copy of Guns! Guns! Guns! (3rd edition) to help convert
from one system to the other.

As usual, this is not by any means the final version of this article, and any
comments are welcome.

       NeuBerlin (circa 5640 AD)

NeuBerlin is the major city of the planet Neubayern.  It was settled in
4517 AD, one year after the _Van der Lubbe_ reached Neubayern.  NeuBerlin
has a population of approximately 2.2 billion people--considerably higher
than the population thirteen years ago, due to the concentration of the
planet\'s population after the Serendip War of 5631.  The population of the
city is presently growing at a rate of 4% per year, in response to the
government\'s policy of encouraging population growth.

The city has a population density of 6500 people per square kilometer.
This density is a bit higher than Tokyo in the late 20th century. The city is

spread across 340,000 square kilometers--an area slightly smaller than
the area of California on Terra. Despite the similarity in population
density, residents of NeuBerlin actually have considerably larger homes
than residents of 20th century Tokyo. Buildings in NeuBerlin are very
tall, giving residents around four times the living space that Tokyo
residents had.

Aside from being generally larger, most buildings in NeuBerlin would not
have looked too out of place in a major Terran city of the 20th century.
In recent years, though, there has been a trend towards buildings that
incorporate gravitic technology. Some examples are buildings that lean
over at a 45 degree angle and buildings in the shape of the owning
company\'s logo.

NeuBerlin is laid out in a grid pattern. Streets are laid out at 500
meter intervals, and run either north/south or east/west. These streets
include pavement and pedestrian walkways at ground level, and flight
bands above the streets for grav vehicles. Larger streets, placed at 5
km intervals, mark district boundaries. These streets have broad medians
which are covered by decorative vegetation.

Vehicles travel on the right side of the street (or flight band) on
Neubayern. Speed limits are generally low for surface traffic, never
above 100 kph even on major streets. The lowest flight band begins 30
meters above the street, and is 10 meters thick--it has the same speed
limit as the street. There will often be additional flight bands higher
up allowing faster travel, and travel along paths other than those
followed by surface streets.

In addition to the surface streets (and their corresponding flight paths)
there are many highways that facilitate rapid travel around NeuBerlin.
These highways are often two-level structures, often suspended above the
surface streets and buildings by grav generators. There are also
high-speed, high-altitude flight paths known as "flyways" that serve as
highways for grav vehicles.

There are broad spaces between each flight band. These spaces allow
access by government traffic, provide the equivalent of "turn lanes" for
grav vehicles, and give space for special traffic such as flying
billboards.

Civilian grav traffic is restricted to following designated flight paths
for the most part. Civilians with sufficient cause (i.e. political pull)
can get permits that let them fly outside flight paths. Also, these
restrictions do not apply to police and emergency services traffic.
Small spacecraft are allowed to fly over NeuBerlin, but they must first
pass a safety certification (basically, the same certification required
for ordinary grav vehicles). Many spacecraft are denied certification
because they are too large to navigate the flight paths, which often pass
between buildings.

NeuBerlin has a very efficient public transportation system which
combines a subway network for short-distance travel with a gravitic
bullet train system for long distances. There is also an extensive bus
system and many taxis.

Despite the availability of public transportation, many residents of
NeuBerlin prefer to own private vehicles. The high standard of living
enjoyed by citizens of Neubayern allows almost anyone who wants one to
own a vehicle. Unfortunately, the large number of private vehicles has
led to a rather severe traffic problem, both on surface streets and in
the flight paths. To counter this, NeuBerlin has a sophisticated traffic
control system which attempts to keep traffic moving by adjusting the
upper and lower speed limits, placing restrictions on ground or air
vehicles allowed through a district, and issueing traffic advisories to
travellers.

Ground cars remain very popular on Neubayern, largely because they are (on
the average) so much cheaper than grav vehicles. They are also easier to
maneuver in enclosed areas such as tunnels and indoor parking structures.
On the down side, they are slower and can be trapped by gridlock.

Grav vehicles have the advantage of speed, but they are more expensive
than ground vehicles and less maneuverable in some situations. Also, the
laws regulating grav vehicles are more strict, since an accident
involving a grav vehicle can cause much more damage than one involving
only ground cars.

A third type of vehicle which is popular on Neubayern is the spinner--a
hybrid vehicle that can function as both a ground car and a grav vehicle.
Spinners have become especially popular since the government began
placing restrictions on numbers of ground or air vehicles that can pass
through a district, since spinners can simply land or take off to avoid
the restrictions. Spinners also combine the speed of grav vehicles with
the close-quarter maneuverability of ground vehicles. They are slightly
more expensive than grav vehicles, and remain the least numerous of the
three types.

Sizeable areas of NeuBerlin were destroyed in the Old Islands War and the
Serendip War.  Most of these areas have been reclaimed and now hold new
districts accomodating the increased population.  Portions of the remaining
destroyed zone have been occupied by criminal elements (who are not greatly
alarmed by government warnings that they might suffer leukemia in 90 years)
and by an assortment of bums, misfits, and people to stubborn to leave
their damaged homes.

In 5630, the government began making long-term plans to build a beanstalk
in NeuBerlin, and a 100 square kilometer area was set aside for the beanstalk

complex. Construction began on Neubayern\'s beanstalk on January 3, 5636,
and is expected to finish in 5646. Although the beanstalk has not yet
been officialy named, it is widely known as \'Spirals.\' This name
originated as an inside joke among project engineers, and gradually
caught on among the general public.

The destruction of the two wars and the resultant social and
economic upheaval has led to skyrocketing crime rates in NeuBerlin,
although during the Imperial Occupation crime stayed fairly low--during
this period, social unrest was directed mostly at the occupying forces. The
NeuBerlin Metropolitan Police Force has been steadily growing since 5628,
and has begun purchasing high-tech equipment from other Alliance worlds
to equip various specialist units.

Neubayern\'s technology is advanced enough to allow mobile
(grav-propelled) buildings to be constructed. This has led to some
unusual phenomenon in recent years. First is the "drive-by" fast food
restaurant. These fast-food buildings cruise along the flyways selling
food to commuters, who place their orders via personal datalink and dock
with the restaurant briefly to pick up their food.

A even newer development (within the past sixten years) is the commuting
building. Some companies have begun providing housing for their employees
in a specific housing development. Every day, the company\'s building
commutes to the housing development from it\'s normal location (usually
near the financial district or spaceport). The NeuBerlin government has
just decided to begin discouraging this practice, as it has begun to
aggravate the city\'s already terrible traffic problem.

Neubayern\'s center of government is located in NeuBerlin, in a huge
building which resembles a metallic volcano. Government Center is a tower
three kilometers high. It is three kilometers at its base, and tapers to
a diameter of 1.5 kilometers at its top, which is flat. Government Center
contains all the workings of Neubayern\'s government, although everything
is duplicated in other, less conspicuous locations.

The Museum of Terran Culture and History is a major tourist attraction in
NeuBerlin. The Museum contains copies of all information that was brought
from Terra by the original colonists, and has assorted displays of what
life was like on Terra throughout history, up until the colonists left.
In addition, the grounds of the Museum hold many reproductions of famous
buildings on Terra. Some examples are the U.S. Capital, Wawel Castle, the
Tower Bridge, and the Imperial compound in Kyoto.

The _Prussia_ Monument is another popular location with tourists. The
_Prussia_ was a sublight warship of the Neubayern System Patrol during
the period when the Serendip Belt first developed jump drive. It played a
major role in defending Neubayern against the Serendip Belt\'s initial
onslaught, and was the only armed Neubayern vessel to survive the first
attacks. The _Prussia_ was the first flagship of the NFN, although it was
retired shortly thereafter and placed in a park adjacent to Government
Center as a monument to those who had died in the fighting.

Neubayern University is located on a bluff overlooking the bay at the
center of NeuBerlin. Founded in 4580, the University is the oldest and
largest institute of higher learning on Neubayern, and attracts students
from all over the Cluster. The University presently has around 200,000
students enrolled.

My wife says the series name was "Cover Up."  There is also a sindicated show
that just started called "Alcupulco H.E.A.T."  that has a similar premise.

Some suggested work activities would be various undercover missions (adapt
James Bond or Top Secret scenarios), counter-terrorist work, guerilla-warfare
(use the cover to enter a world to perform demolition, kidnapping, or
assassination mission).

1.Size related details step 9 (p 62) states "P" is in standard
days; should be hours, as in the example that follows it.

2.WBH strongly implies that the orbit number of a satellite is in
central planet diameters (e.g. step 8a on page 62); it is in fact radii
(e.g. MegaTraveller Refs Manual, old Book 6).  The same error also
appears explicitly in Travellers Digest (e.g. TD 19 p 35).  So halve
orbital distance in radii to get distance in diameters.

3.The definition of gas giant size is inconsistent with TNE,
MegaTraveller Refs Manual [e.g. p17), old Book 6, and other DGP
publications (e.g. Terra system writeup).  Small gas giants should range
in UWP size from 20 to 74; large gas giants should range from 75 to 140;
brown dwarfs start above that.  I use the table below which corrects
these problems (as far as I know!).  It also categorises gas giants from
the Terra system correctly (i.e. matches previously published official
writeups).  Saturn (UWP size about 80) and Jupiter (about 90) are large
gas giants; Uranus and Neptune are small gas giants (UWP size each about
30).  Previously, even Jupiter was a small gas giant according to WBH.
Don\'t use brown dwarfs without reading up on them first - they are
complex beasties (e.g. the more massive they are, the smaller they get).

Yes, that\'s right.  The same people who brought you the Reality

reality checks bounce!

And don\'t forget about our patented Reality Patches with Extra-Strong

It seems as though GDW assumed that both the transmitter and the reciever
would be using low-efficency omnidirectional antennas, and if you want to
get any sort of directional antenna, you have to buy a \'maser\'
communicator.

Seriously, though, I\'ve got an off-the-cuff suggestion to "fix" the radio
range problem (and yes, it *is* a problem).  What about the following:

Unless special conditions apply, any planet with a thin, standard, or dense
atmosphere (tainted or not) has an ionosphere.  The referee should determine
the presence or absence of an ionosphere in other cases (none, trace, and
very thin normally don\'t, while exotic, corrosive, and insidious normally
do).

Radio communicators should be designated as \'space\' or \'planetary\' when
constructed (this is a rough idea of it\'s frequency capabilities).  \'Space\'
radios are designed to take advantage of radio windows in planetary
atmospheres to be able to line-of-sight broadcasts through the ionosphere.
\'Planetary\' communicators take advantage of the ionospheres to bounce
signals around the planet.  For existing designs, spacecraft are assumed to
be equipped with \'space\' radios, while planetary vehicles are assumed to be
equipped with \'planetary\' radios.

\'Planetary\' communicators of 1kw or more can be recieved anywhere on the
planet, as if at long range.  \'Space\' communicators follow the standard
rules.

The second change I would suggest is that the range of the *transmitter* be
used to determine the range (the range rating of the reciever being
irrellevant in this case).  Of course, if you are trying to establish 2-way
communication, both sides will be transmitting, limiting the range of 2-way
conversation to the shortest of the ranges of the communicators involved.

However, you should be able to use the energy gathering qualities of a dish
antenna, combined with powerful low-noise amplification provided by a maser
or the more efficient TWT (travelling wave tube) amplifiers, to improve the
eception range.  This is assuming that the FF&S radio communicators are
designed assuming an omnidirectional antenna on both the transmitter and
reciever, and that FF&S \'maser\' communicators represent any radio with a
directional transmit or recieve antenna.  The change I propose is as
follows:

You may use radio communicators and maser communicators in together.  The
short range of such a combination is the longer of either half the short
range of the maser communicator, or the shorter of the ranges of the two
communicators.  For example, if a radiocomm of 60km was used to communicate
with a 30,000km masercomm, the short range would be 15,000km.  On the other
hand, the short range of a 30,000km masercomm and a 30,000km radiocomm is
30,000km.

No, it\'s not perfect, but it just might be a \'quick-n-dirty\'
fix.  Any other comments?


> Now for the drive problem.

Well, Traveller maneuver drives have never conserved energy.  Violating
conservation of energy makes interplanetary travel much more \'interesting\',
in that it doesn\'t take unreasonable amounts of time to get where you\'re
going.

The HEPlaR drive as detailed in FF&S is *COMPLETELY* and *TOTALLY*
impossible, and breaks at least three different physical laws.  If this
bothers you, work out some guidelines for "reasonable" drives (you\'ve gotten
off to a good start in your post) and go ahead and use them.

However, HEPlaR drive makes Brilliant Lances space combat interesting and
playable.  Other drives would profoundly affect the game, and you should
consider the playability effects that this would have (not to mention you
would have considerable work to do to prepare new ship designs and new rules
for your new drive).

If HEPlaR bothers you only a little bit (and that\'s about the category it
falls in for me), slap a reality patch on it, and buy some overdraft
protection for your reality checks, and then you don\'t have to worry about
it ;-)

I just bought it (and subscribed to this group).  The errors ARE
NOT CORRECTED.  The Update book is included, but I\'d rather they had
waited until the second printing (December 1993, according to the Update
book) to put the deluxe box together.

I\'ll reserve critical, or other, input until I\'ve caught-up on
some of the old bundles (up to 509 from 500).

Quick question for you all. When determining safe 100 diameter jump distance
for your ship, how many of you check out whether you are also within the stars
100 diameters as per Scouts Book 6
p.42?

It struck me that for many main planets who circle at orbit 0 around dim M
class stars the 100 diameter thresh hold of the star would be far more
important than the world\'s. Thus for each world generated using the more
detailed stellar information found in \'Scouts\' a special calculation of the
safe jump distance from the star would need to be
made.

         i.e. +0.876kg  +100Cr.  but Bulk drops to 3. Recoil remains the same.
          And don\'t forget that recoil drops to 1 if you use the bipod....
 Minor Note- it may not be a good idea to let PCs use this on NPCs, for the
             following reason....
             With ROF 50 it fires as ROF 10 but every hit counts as 5 normal
             hits. Even if the target is wearing 16 point armour, the blunt
             trauma effects of each HE or HEAP bullet are 8 points of damage
             8*5 = 40 = remove NPC from board. And it fires 50 of those shots
             a turn...
                          Hope this is useful to SOMEONE out there

Thought I\'d post a message letting everyone know that
THE TRAVELLER CHRONICLE #3 is out! It came back from the printers Jan. 14
and Kevin mailed copies to suscribers last week. The table of contents
for issue #3 follows:

The Far Frontiers
The second installment of the Far Frontiers Sector by Dale Kemper
(with subsector maps for: Taermerlyk, Inverness, Wulfek)

Bonnie Mess
A Traveller: The New Era adventure by Mark "Geo" Gelinas

Lady Charlotte Class Yatch
A complete TNE ship including deckplans by Mark "Geo" Gelinas

Mercury Quest
The conclusion to Ridpath\'s quest by Gary A. Kalin
(More about this later)

Astrogator\'s Update to Diaspora Sector
Continuing the Diaspora Sector update by Charles E. Gannon


All good stuff, especially the Traveller Fiction . If anyone likes the
Traveller fiction that Gary Kalin wrote as much as I did - then PLEASE
write a short note encouraging him to produce more. Due to a change in
jobs, he doesn\'t plan on it - but maybe we can change his mind! Send the
notes to either Kevin or myself, and we will see that he reads them.

I\'d also like to Thank Geo for the excellent adventure, and hint that if
all goes well, you will be seeing his work on a regular basis... (a column
is in the works).

The Keith brothers have contacted us at last!!! They are presently swamped
with book contracts, so do not have the time to write anything *new* for
us yet.... HOWEVER, they have given us permission to publish some of their
older, little known material. I\'ll keep you posted as things develope in
the future...(we might be printing something as soon as next issue). I
would just like to add - if you want to see some NEW material from the
Keith brothers....then write \'em a note requesting it! I mean, it can\'t
hurt right, and just might tempt them to set aside those book manuscripts
for a couple of days...

  ** CONTEST ** CONTEST ** CONTEST ** CONTEST ** CONTEST ** CONTEST **

We are having a little contest starting this issue....let me quote Kevin:

"Lastly, in issue two, I promised there would be a new contest and here it
is. I want you to send me something little that can be put in the
magazine. A  fake classified ad (like the one in this issue), an ad for an
item in the Traveller universe (like the Zilan Eiswein ad in issue two),
an identification badge, whatever! Be creative. You don\'t have to be a
mojor artist or writer to come up with something witty or funny. Just try.
The prize is a grab bag of old, odd Traveller items, including
the Cardboard Heros from Steve Jackson Games [all three sets, complete],
the Traveller Badge Set from that company \'down under\', and more! So send
in those entries...."

I would like to add that if anyone has an odd, interesting NPC that would
make a good \'casual encounter\' article, then send it in!


** NEWS FLASH ** NEWS FLASH ** NEWS FLASH ** NEWS FLASH ** NEWS FLASH **

The Keith brothers still had some of their old folio adventures on hand
and Kevin obtained as many of them as he could. They include FLEETWATCH,
SALVAGE MISSION, and FLIGHT of the STAG..... They are good stuff, and
Classic Traveller... and here is what we are going to do with them:

We are going to give them away... :)

The first thirty people to suscribe or renew their subscription will
receive a free copy of EACH one of these adventures.

One last thing, and then I will head out systen...

I would like to thank all of the people, many of you TML\'ers, for helping
make TTC#3 a reality. Things were real iffy when issue #2 first came out,
but then subscriptions picked up, and word has spread  and we are still
here and going strong! We are not ready to take the money and run quite
yet (altho if you know of a cozy garden planet with lax tax laws...) - but
Kevin informs me that issue #3 is the first one he has not had to take a
loan on to get it printed...anyways, we are at the break even point, and I
want to thank all our suscribers.

The Traveller Chronicle is also available from four distributors (with
more one the way). They are:

Armoury
Wargames West
Everything Unreal
Liberty Hobby Distributors

Until issue #4...(due out first week of April), take care and
Happy Travelling!

Strephon Lives,

I think the show you\'re looking for was called "Cover Up".  It had
John Eric Hexum (the actor who shot himself with a blank pistol).

It most definitely wasn\'t Knight Rider.. and unless Fabio has
killed himself recently (we can all hope) it wasnt\' Acapulco Heat
either.  Cover up (if I\'ve got the name of the show right) ran in
the early/mid 80\'s, and ended kinda quickly.. the guy they got to
follow up Hexum was an awful actor.

In case you\'re not sure who Hexum was, he also played the Pirate
time traveller in "The Voyagers" (I think)..where he had the side
kick, and they\'d go through time fixing things (kind of a predecessor
to Quantum Leap, except that instead of Al with a palmtop terminal,
they had a very ambiguous stop-watch type thing called "the omni").

Anyways, hope I cleared something up (and sent this to the right
addy).

I hate to say it, but no it dosen\'t.  Such a vessel would be useless for
anything other than planetary bombardment or beating up on free traders.
Even a large target with agility-0 and a TL15 computer could not be hit.
That\'s a very unlikely target, but it illustrates how futile it is to build
fighters that have no bridge and a comp mod 1.  I have designed fighters at
TL 11 that could mop this TL 15 design up, and never take a single hit in
return.  Of course, my fighter designs have a tendency to be somewhat costly,
but that\'s OK as you lose far less of them.  Against an opponent of equal
TL, of course.  If you run up against an enemy fighter with a computer just
2 factors higher, you\'re dogfood. :-)


Thank God, CT.  Something I can comment on! :-)

I also have a question concerning blast radius for HEAP rounds.
The printed rule states that the blast radius is half that of an HE round.
This sounds right to me, as a HEAP round is a shaped charge and would vent
more energy in one direction.  My question arises from the update booklet
which "corrects" the blast radius to equal that of an HE round.  Is this
correction correct?

Has anyone addressed the issue of overpenetration?  You can fire a
DS round (small arms) at someone that has a large amount of energy, but if
it is slender enough, it will pass right through the target without
transfering most of that energy.  I guess my question might be, what is
the AV of a Human/Aslan/Vargr/etc. ?

I thought about this a while ago, as I was using Scouts to work out 100
diameter limits from the central star.  This can cause difficulities,
especially for large stars, where the typical habital zone is way within
the 100 diam limit.  I had one world which had to be about 40+ days from
the jump point to me reasonably habitable!

So, thoughts: The 100 diameter rule was originally intended to apply to
planets, coming as it does direct from CT (where stars were just pretty
lights in the sky).  This means that the gravity at the jump point is
0.0025 % of the surface gravity.  Now stars (taking the Sun as a model)
are less dense than planets, so the diameter for a given mass is far
greater.  This means you have to travel *fewer* stellar diameters to
reach a safe jump point.  I put some figures together to come up with a
rule of thumd, and I reckon that you can jump at only *20* stellar
diamters.  Gas Giants turn out to have a similar density (near enuogh for
this sort of rough rule), so I\'ve adjusted the gas giant jump point also.

Of course, this has some sonsequences for increased use of micro jumps
closer to the star, but I think the whole thing works better.  Also, this
*is* only a rule of thumb; if the jump distance depends on gravity, then
it would vary dramatically between small, icy bodies, and large, extra
dense bodies.

  For the person who asked about the volume capacity of battledress
last week, there isn\'t any.  The volume of all added gear is _in_addition_
to the base Storage Volume listed.  The only controlling factors are
weight (by exoskeleton class) and power (by power supply).

 Onwards...

 > I\'m a new Traveller player/gamemaster and I intend to do a campaign which
 >will include some mechas. ( Yeah, like the Mobile Suits in the Gundam

  I first had this idea back when Robotech was new.  Unfortunately, all
I had to work with was a combination of MegaTraveller and Striker.  I\'ve
still got a page of "ideas" around here somewhere for integrating
humanoid transforming vehicles into the Traveller rules.
  Fortunately I discovered Mekton soon after.  This game allowed me to
play with "mecha" in an otherwise straight SF setting and not worry
about the mechanics mix.
  The next edition of Mekton (called Mekton II, though it\'s really the
third edition) was even better for this, since it came right out and
said that since mecha combat _looked_ like two guys in funny suits, it
should be played that way.  Mekton II uses the same set of mechanics for
both scales (human and "giant robot") with differences only for scale
and such things as catastrophic powerplant failure.  This idea will
drop into TNE (or any earlier edition) without any problems.

  I\'ve always been of the "What a NEAT toy!" persuasion regarding
Traveller in general and vehicles in particular, and thus I prefer my
mecha small.  The various hardware in the Robotech conglomerate of
stories (Macross, Southern Cross, and Mospeada for the initiated) is
about as big as I want to get, though I confess to a fondness for Dynamo
Joe and the Gunbuster.

  But to business.  What Traveller is missing first and foremost if
you want to do giant robots of any sort, is _arms_.  The arms presented
in the Robots rules (both versions) are too small and too poorly
described to be of much help.  Instead of sitting down and working out
the whole spectrum of possible sizes and strengths, you should limit
your work to the range you intend to work in.  Unfortunately, this range
is rather broad even in the Gundam material (The "O"\'s secondary arms
all the way up to the Alpha Azire; gulp!).  Find a smaller range or
risk loss of interest.
  Arms should be defined by inherent characteristics (volume, wt, power,
cost), and by how much volume and/or weight can be added to them in the
form of hardware.  The Armor building section in FF&S does this correctly
for our purposes: Volume is calculated last, based on the Storage Volume
(Volume of the skeleton, armor, power and control for mecha) plus the
added volume of other stuff (weapons, flight systems, streamlining, etc).

  Another point of definition is the "quality of movement".  Do your
Traveller mechs move like Anime mechs (ie. like humans in funny suits),
or are they stiff, slow, and of precarious balance?  A good example
of the two classes would be Ultraman vs. an Imperial ATAT.  If you
just want one of these then the Legs in FF&S (and earlier rules) require
no modification.  If you want both at the same time (but in different
mechs) then two classes of legs will be required, as well as a provision
for "Agility" in the MT Starship sense: more excess power = better
ability to dodge, weave, and otherwise parrot human motion.
  The Anime motion style gives its own excuse for the existence of
large humanoid vehicles:  a vehicle that can react to terrain, dodge
shells, and aim weapons as fast as a human can will earn a place on the
battlefields of the future.  If you go for the ATAT style of movement,
then your designs have to have some other advantage of survivability,
(ATATs have unreasonable amounts of armor, for instance) or they\'ll
never get very big.  Conventional vehicles with turrets and heat- or
laser-guided munitions will hit a slow-moving, clumsy and TALL mech
every time.

  While I have considered going further in this direction, I find that
I can get away with designing my desired suit in Mekton II (using the
Mekton Advanced Construction Manual for odd stuff), then convert the
armor, weapon damage, and range scales to Traveller.  Mekton already
has a characteristic which will convert nicely to TNE Initiative,
and which already applies to both human and giant scales.
  Note that Mekton and the ACM produce results similar to the Cyberpunk
Maximum Metal book, but slanted toward the Anime style instead of the
\'Punk/realist style of MM.  I haven\'t tried the GURPS approach, but
I understand that it will produce a few more of the details that
Traveller designs often have: powerplant Megawatts, tonnage to some
decimal value, etc.  It really depends on what feel you want for your
mecha.

HO time:  I too like the TNE rules and universe.  I think that the
rules are an improvement, and well, the universe is more to my like.  The
background preference is very subjective, and so I do understand the
feelings of those that have posted stating their dismay at the fall of the
Imperium (how many are in denial?).  It would be nice if GDW marketted
three different lines of product, one for each universe (3rd Imp, HT, and
NE).  Figure the odds.  Well, someone can always compile an e-magazine for
the different subject areas.
As to why I like TNE...I have to echo someone else\'s opinion about
a universe with a "frontier".  That\'s what I like in an RPG. This is why
my opinion is MY opinion.  The CT universe (I never played MT) provided
for a wide variety of play options, but most of them did not appeal to me,
and the frontier-flavor ones that did seemed like they made the rest of
the background unimportant.  There also just weren\'t that many real
frontiers.  In TNE there are nothing but frontiers...and I am happy.
I also must sympathize with (at least) one of the CT players that
does not have time to synthesize everything himself now that the Imperial
universe is in ruins.  In my case, I\'m lacking the time to set up a
campaign in TNE, and it\'s a supported product!

I finally remembered what my fix for this was:
    density * 10 or 100 = actual diameters of jump thresholds

For low-density bodies like GG\'s and stars, the "100-diameter"
mark is now at 20-40 diameters, which in most cases makes the
problem go away.

with stellar-scale fusion reactions....

for anything better. In fact, my fighters were at the wrong side of that
equation from his fighters at the beginning of Steve\'s TCS campaign, before
the Alliance.

And now, the War Channel presents, "Wings of the Neubayern Federation." :-)

FA-2B Asp  FH-0606C51-000000-00003-0 MCr74.42  45 tons
bearing                          1   Crew=1
batteries                        1   TL=12(13)
Fuel=6. EP=6. Agility=6.

Has fuel scoops, bridge, and small craft stateroom.

The Asp was the mainstay of the NFN fighter force when the TCS campaign
ended, although it was being phased out of service. Over 2000 were also in
service with the Alliance Navy. The Asp was actually only marginally better
than Sansterre\'s Barracuda fighter, but it was more than capable against the
fighters the Alliance faced early on. Since the Alliance couldn\'t count on
the rest of the Cluster keeping their junk fighters, several heavy fighter
designs were built.

FA-5 Krait  FH-0606G81-000000-00004-0 MCr175.25  90 tons
bearing                           1   Crew=1
batteries                         1   TL=12(14)
Cargo=.41. Fuel=7.49. EP=14.4. Agility=6

Has fuel scoops, bridge, and stateroom. The Krait uses some non-standard
technology that was developed by the more technologically advanced members of
the Alliance, specifically an NH3 fuel system and a dual missile turret
system.

The Krait was slowly being phased in as the new standard NFN fighter when the
game ended, a process made slow by the great expense of refitting carriers
that were built for 50-ton fighters. Although it normally carried only the
pilot, it could also carry a gunner who would guide in extended-range
missiles (a Sansterrean invention), which could be launched from ships well
outside normal weapon range. It\'s capabilities are very similar to
Sansterre\'s Pike fighters, which carried two missile gunners instead of the
second turret. The Krait, and the other fighters like it, were so superior to
non-Alliance fighters that they could be expected to go up against ten times
their number or more and come out victorious with no losses. However, they
were not the end of Alliance fighter development.

FA-5B Streak Krait  FH-0606(C)N81-000000-00004-0 MCr185.45  90 tons
bearing                                      1   Crew=1
batteries                                    1   TL=12(15)
Fuel=19.96. EP=19.8. Agility=6(12).

The Streak Krait is outwardly identical to the Krait, but with the additon of
a TL15 enhanced output maneuver drive and afterburning power
plant--technology that was still in the prototype stage on St. Hilaire when
the game ended. When using afterburners (that is, using the power plant as a
fusion rocket), it could reach 12G acceleration and Agility 12. In practice,
it wouldn\'t need to go above 10G/agility 10 to be essentially unhittable with
conventional weapons. It carries 9.66 tons of fuel dedicated to the
afterburners, enough for almost 16 hours at 10G. St. Hilaire\'s Shark fighter
program was working on a similar fighter.

The NFN Fighter Design Bureau had designed the Streak Krait fighter knowing
that the TL15 drive systems would not be available for a year or more, and
went ahead with production of the Krait in the meantime. Krait fighters were
to be converted into Streak Kraits as soon as enough replacement engines
became available. Afterburning fighters would doubtless become the standard
during the Cluster Liberation War against the Imperium.

Although afterburning craft (there were plans for cruisers and battlecruisers
as well) seem invincible by virtue of their high agility, there are
apparently some weapons that were being developed at the end of the TCS game
that could hit them. What those weapons were exactly remain a mystery.

In FF&S Dampers are designed by range.  What\'s the cutoff?
The TL-15 damper shown has a range of 40,000 km.

If I build a range-10 damper, can I engage all missles within
10 hexes, even if I don\'t know if it is targeted on my ship?
(range difficulty modifiers are applicable here, of course)

If I have such a damper, but a fighter is braving defensive
fire to bring the missle in close, could I focus the damper
on it\'s missles while they\'re still on the launch rails?

For that matter, if I\'m using a damper powerful enough  to
have that kind of range, could I damp the figher\'s fusion powerplant?
What if it\'s using a fission plant?

Don\'t use the 0.0025% G-threshold.  For our Sun it occurs at 500 diameters.
I know that sounds weird, but I worked through the gravity equations
several times just to convinvce myself. The distance (in diameters) to
a given g-threshold winds up being _inversly_ related to density.

ie. if one body has a density one-fifth that of a second body,
a given g-threshold of the first body will be at five times the
diameter-distance as the same threshold from the second body.

But my solution was the same as yours, and I just chucked saying
it was tied to anything other than density.

Agreed, although it really is a cost/benefit equation.  I can bring three Ape
class fighters to bear for _each_ model 5 computer that your fighters are
equipped with, or 5 Apes to your Asp.  (Really only 4, but much closer to 5.)

In other words, you\'ll hit one target on an six or better (penetration on a
zero or better.)  Hits will be scattered on the Surface damage table from 9-19,
centered around 14, with fuel hits being the most critical (I\'d require a
Jump-drive hit to affect the Ape\'s capacitor, though), so at the very worst an
Ape would last three turns (assuming two weapon-2 hits on the fusion gun, and
one on the missile.)

Note that the TL-15 ape will last substatially longer than the TL-12 variety,
but what did you expect?...  :)

In the mean time, you\'ve got four fusion guns that are\'nt going to hit you,
ever.

Excellent analasyis, and something I noticed quite a while back, but forgot
sometime between then and now.

I think I\'ll have to go and re-design most of my small-craft (again...)

Did you include the bridge in your designs?  I haven\'t reverse enginerred them,
so I\'m just wondering...  I\'d guess that yes you did, because: by the time
computers start requiring energy points to maintain, it becomes cheaper/more
space efficient to include a bridge in the design.

Actually, _my_ extrapolation of the M-Drive tble shows that M-12 would be

curve could be just about anything, but my assumption was three-Gs per TL.

Do tell?  I once designed a vessel that was "invulerable" do to it\'s agility.
I wound up compromising on the design, since I wanted it to be able to perform
in atmosphere as well as hydrosphere, and I didn\'t think that pulling 10 Gs
underwater was advisable, so I added lots of armor and trimmed the maneuver
drive back into the realm of the standard tables.

Note that one can still design TL 14 craft that are impervious to "small arms"
(anything but a spinal mount, or a nuclear missile.) based on armor factor
alone.

[All of the above related to CT/HG, and had nothing to do with MT or TNE.]

A question for GDW: Why are there arbitrary limits on the range of available
drives?  Rather than having to extrapolate, I\'d really like to see official
numbers/ratings posted or in print.  (Thanks Loren!)

  When I asked the question about how the Rebellion might have turned out I
 was a bit lazy and didn\'t make any suggestions of my own- mainly because I
 didn\'t have any strong opinions (of anything, ever).

  Thanks to those people who made suggestions, they were very interesting.
 Here are some other aspects of the Rebellion I was considering-

 1) The most likely result, as Jeff Zeitlin detailed, seems to be a lot of
    not-very-nice states who are eventually forced to cease attacking each
    other by economic collapse and internal dissent. The \'Very Short Night\'
    falls. The Rebellion won\'t actually be \'over\' for generations.
    Someone will eventually try to reclaim all the Wilds- probably Deneb or
    the Solomani. I can see a whole new war around 1200 with two basic power
    blocks- one including Deneb and one the Confederation.

 2) The Catastrophe Theory- things are more interesting if you assume that
    something unexpected happens to chuck a spanner into the whole business
    The virus did this- here\'s another option...

    1128- Lucan, unlike most mad dictators through history, is assasinated at
          a war meeting. The brothers of Varian claim responsibility

          An underground Moot reveals itself and once again declares itself
          as ruler until an Emperor is decided upon. A Military Coup is only
          just avoided (many military staff are afraid of court martial)
          when the Moot declare amnesty for those that support them.

          \'The Real Lucan\' appears- twice- one is shot by a fleet admiral and
          the other gets a fleet to join him and flees the Imperium.

    1129- After meetings between Core and Delphi it is agreed that Margaret
          will become Empress if it is proved her son is Strephon\'s

    1130- Core, Delphi, Deneb and what remains of Usdiki are now united under
          Strephons son.  The resulting alliance effectively ends the civil
          war since the combined force is able to rebuild it\'s economy much
          more effectively than any other and will *eventually* win
          There will still be years of fighting, and maybe the Imperium\'s
          problems are only dormant, but at least it will recover. What happens
          with the Confederation and the smaller states, and Dulinor, could
          not really br predicted.

    PS- Total deaths in the Rebellion where around 1% (calculated by HIWG)
        So much for Hard Times

   3)   The Aslan could decide to do something more than attack Deneb with
        TL12 Light Cruisers (Target Drones for TL15 Imperial ships)
        They could just be waiting for the right time to get the person who
        they REALLY have a grudge against- Dulinor.
         There is also the possibility at any time of the old Aslan-Solomani
        fight breaking out, considering how well the Solomani might do out of
        the Rebellion the Aslan may feel thay have to stop them now...

                           __________________________

      Minor TNE comment (or \'DID YOU KNOW THAT\')
          In FF&S the Grav Tank has over a quarter of it\'s mass devoted to
         Fusion gun ammo. If the \'Reality\' in TNE is that different to that
         in CT why bother using GDW rules at all? I may try GURPS now :)

The following may be way off the deep end but ...

  When Lucan claimed the Iridium Throne he prevented the Moot from
meeting for quite some time.  There were limits to the length of time he
could do so and eventually they did meet although nothing was decided.
No definite validation for any of the potential rulers of the Imperium
was made: not quite half the Moot was divided between Lucan and Dulinor,
Norris received the next largest support followed by Margaret and a few
backers sided with Strephon in addition to a number of abstentions.
  The Moot then broke down into arguing, shouted threats, and ultimately
several brawls.  Eventually enough order was restored to adjurn.  The
members of the Moot (and this meeting included one of the largest turn-
outs ever) then went their separate ways - seeking those whom they
supported to claim the Iridium Throne.

  Intense fighting among the four factions broke out and continued for
the better part of a decade.  Norris, for many varied reasons, did not
enter the fray.  During this period no one within the bounds of the
former Imperium if caught by those from a different faction ( and
travellers from outside the Imperium were attacked by all the factions).
  During this period of civil war Margaret\'s faction was reduced to the
point of continuing only as an underground liberation/terrorist
(depending on your point of view) movement.  Stephon\'s forces also took
a beating and was confined to a few systems and a handful of ships in
various states of disrepair.
  The remaining two factions each ended up controlling roughly half of
the remaining central Imperium.  No clear victor emerged and both
continued to claim the mantle of the Third Imperium.  Both factions
carry on limited actions against one another.
  The situation is not unlike Europe of the Dark Ages with petty nobles
attacking the other faction to prove their mettle.  Barons and Knights
often use this method to try to gain repute and ingratiate themselves
himself or herself with their superiors.

  Viva la freedom!  Although "Burning Bright" by Melissa Scott was a
well written book concerning virtual reality role-playing gaming the
only drawback to her idea of gaming was that everyone was restricted to
using the official universe.  We don\'t have that limitation although the
farther removed a game is from published material the more difficult it
is for a game master to use such material - obviously a balance must be
reached.

Part 2 of 2:
  The first part dealt with my hypothesis for the central Imperium while
this installment details the fringe zones and other empires.

  The four factions of the shattered Imperium concentrated their efforts
against one another and so not much was done to the seccessionists -
Antares, Daibei, and Vland.  What little was marshalled to return these
areas to the fold was ineffective; Antares wwas able to call upon the
Julian Protectorate for help, Vland was mostly overlooked as Dulinor
spent his efforts on Daibei, which was pushed toward the Aslan Heirate.
Daibei gained about as much in this direction as they lost to Dulinor.
Eventually they stiffened resistance to Dulinor\'s attacks as they
increasing came into conflict with the Aslan on their opposite border.

  Taking advantage of the Imperium\'s internecine wqarfare the Solomani
Confederation once again expanded to reoccupy the full Solomani Sphere
but went no further.  For reasons not well understood the Solomani left
the Vegan Autonomous District mostly intact.  The Aslan and vargr also
made small scale encroachments at this time.
  This had the most impact on the area "behind the claw."  After
initially meeting little resistance both the Aslan and Vargr met fierce
counterattacks from Norris\' forces.  Initially Norris was slow to
respond because he was involved with diplomatic negotiations with the
aim of maintaining relations with the Zhodani.  He also had to contend
with an increasingly agressive Vilani Ziru Sirka which did severed
nearly all contact with the central Imperium, on top of communications
hampered by the effects of the civil war.  Norris, out of contact and
unsure of who really was the true Emperor, established the Archduchy of
Deneb nearly a decade after Dulinor\'s power play.

  The other interstellar governments (Zhodani, K\'kree, Hivers, and even
the Solomani) saw the turmoil unleased within the Imperium.  The
consensus seemed to be that this was a symptom the the unwieldy size of
the Imperium.  They therefore refrained from seeking to greatly
enlarging their empires, especially at the expense of a impotent
Imperium.  Additionally the powers began to form various alliances which
were aimed at maintaining a balance of power - when one seemed to become
too strong alliances were made to reduce that threat.  Norris never
allied against either Dulinor or Lucan although at times he delayed in
assisting them in these alliances.
  Events continued in this manner even after the deaths of Dulinor,
Lucan and Norris.  Fifty years after the shattering of the Third
Imperium the known universe was a more diverse place with a number of
evenly sized empires, quite a nember of which were largely human in its
various forms: Solomani, Vilani, Zhodani, Denebians, and former Imperial
(Rimward Imperium and Spinward Imperium).

A (relatively) recent discussion on TML got me thinking about campaigns.
What do Traveller players and referees currently play?  So I asked that
TMLers who are currently in a campaign (as either players or referees) to
send me some e-mail saying which rules and what campaign background you are
using.

I got a total of 42 responses, describing 52 campaigns (two people were
involved in three campaigns at once, and six were involved in two campaigns
at once).  Several people described campaigns which had just ended (finished
and unlikeley to continue) or ones that they *would* run if an opportunity
presented itself - I didn\'t count either of these cases.

I can draw some interesting observations from the results.  First of all, 42
responses is a statistically significant sample of the TML population.
While I have no way of knowing if the sample is random or not (the sample
is those people who responded to my survey), there is also no reason to
believe that it is *not* representative of the TML as a whole.

I\'m on more shaky ground when I try to extrapolate the results on TML to the
game-buying population as a whole.  I would suggest that TML is representative
of the older segment of the game market (college students and young adults),
while it virtually ignores the younger segment of the market (high-school-age
buyers).


SUMMARY:

The envelope, please:

The rule set with the most campaigns is _TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA, with 50% of
the vote, and more than twice the number of the closest runner-up.

The background with the most campaigns is CLASSIC THIRD IMPERIUM, with 48%
of the vote, and slighly less than twice the number of the closest runner-up.


RULES:

RankTitlePercent

#1Traveller: The New Era50%
#2MegaTraveller21%
#3"Classic" Traveller19%
#42300AD 6%
#5GURPS 4%

I was suprised to see MegaTraveller get more votes than Classic Traveller,
although the result is quite close (one vote!).  From TML traffic, I would
have expected it to score significantly higher.


CAMPAIGNS:

RankEra or BackgroundPercent (*)

#1"Classic" Third Imperium48%
#2"New Era" Campaigns27%
#3Rebellion12%
#4Other10%
#52300AD 4%

(*) Does not sum to 100% due to rounding.

This result was suprising, particularly in light of the above.  I would have
expected that the New Era campaign background would have been more popular
with New Era purchasers, but only a small majority (54%) of those who use
T:TNE play in the official T:TNE universe.

Traveller: The New Era 9 314----26
GURPS 1---- 1 2
2300AD---- 2 1 3

TOTALS25 614 5 252

What\'s interesting here is the depth of support for the "Classic" Third
Imperium.  No matter which rules set you are talking about, it seems that
there is a significant percentage of those people playing in a 3rd Imperial
background.  It would be interesting to compare sales to date of T:TNE with
total sales of Classic Traveller and MegaTraveller, I wonder if it
correlates with the numbers of campaigns currently being played?


CONCLUSIONS:

I note that the largest single segment of the Traveller campaign "space" is
the T:TNE rules and the "official" Post-Collapse background.  But this
is internally fractured, and (for example) RCES or Star Viking materials may
be of limited utility to people who are running a Pocket Empire or Regency
campaign.  These "New Era" campaigns also represent slightly less than 27%
of the Traveller campaigns currently being played.  While there\'s no larger
single rules/setting combination, there should be a way to reach a broader
part of the Traveller players.

If it were up to me, I\'d certainly put some effort into a "Classic" Third
Imperium campaign supplement.  Potentially, such a supplement could be
impetus to cause new sales of the T:TNE rules, be "converting" people who at
present see no advantage to changing rules systems.

Again, IMHO (In My Humble Opinion) there\'s not a whole lot of point to the
other segments of the market.  There\'s no effective way to write for the
"other" segment - FF&S comes about as close as you can get to targetting this
population with it\'s alternative technology rules.  The Rebellion represents
a small market (11.5%), and in addition, "Third Imperium" materials may
still be useful in a Rebellion-era campaign.

The numbers for 2300AD may not be reliable.  TML is composed primarliy of
Traveller players, and discussion doesn\'t usually apply very well to 2300AD
topics; therefore the game and it\'s background may be significantly
under-represented in the survey.


NOTES:

"Traveller: The New Era" includes two rule sets: Traveller: The New Era and
Deluxe Traveller: The New Era (referred to elsewhere as T:TNE and DT:TNE,
respectively).

"MegaTraveller" is just that.

"Classic Traveller" is a number of rules sets and options: Traveller (the
original boxed set, Books 1-3), Deluxe Traveller, The Traveller Book, and
Starter Traveller.  Any or all of these rules, in combination with Books
4-8, Striker, and/or the DGP Task System (described extensively in The
Travellers\' Digest prior to the publication of MegaTraveller) - these all
were aggregated under "Classic" Traveller, because they were effectively the
same game.

"2300AD" includes Traveller: 2300 and the revised edition, 2300AD.  No
respondents reported that they are using the original (Traveller: 2300)
edition.

"GURPS" is, of course, a Steve Jackson Games product; it was included
because I have heard considerable anecdotal evidence that it is a popular
choice for people who don\'t consider Traveller a viable game system, but
want to continue playing in a Traveller-like setting.  It is aparrently not
as popuar as word of mouth would have it.

The definitions of the campaign backgrounds are or course more subjective.
In general, I went with whatever label the respondent chose for his or her
campaign.  In a few cases it was a tough call, but I put the response in the
category that seemed to fit best.

"Classic Third Imperium" campaigns are those set in or around the
Pre-Rebellion Third Imperium.  Some referees indicated that they may implement
the Rebellion in their campaigns.  Just like hypothetical or future campaigns,
I categorized campaigns based on what is happening *now*, and not on
future plans which may or may not be realized.

"New Era Campaigns" are those set in a Post-Crash universe, whether it be
the official RCES and Star Viking setting, or referee-developed Pocket
Empire, Free Trader or even Regency campaigns.  I would like to provide a
breakdown of the different types, but in many cases there isn\'t enough
detail in the responses to say for sure which category is applicable.

"Rebellion" campaigns are those set anywhere in Imperial space in any time
after the assasination of Strephon to the Crash.

"Other" campaigns are those in original referee-generated universes, or
universes modified beyond recognition.

"2300AD" campaigns are those that use the Traveller: 2300 or 2300AD campaign
settings.  There don\'t seem to be many of these around anymore.


If anyone has additional questions about this, send me some E-mail and I
will be happy to answer questions about this survey.

One thing I\'ve noticed in the "didn\'t consider the extremes" department
is in crewing ship PAWs and Meson Guns.

Unless you\'re giving it a range overcapacity for improved planetary
bombardment performance, ship PAWs only need to have an effective
range of about 50 hexes, since once range DiffMods are factored in
(+1 per 3 hexes), 50 hexes is the absolute maximum range you can
hit anything, given an 800 RoF and a Gigantic target.

Cruiser-sized PAWs with an effective range of 50 hexes may be
200+ meters long, but less than 2 meters wide. PAWs have a maximum
bore per length but no minimum (both rightly so, IMHO). However,
since the crew requirement is directly tied only to the volume, the
volume of a EffRng=50 PAW yeilds a crew of one or two at tech 15.

The crew of a Meson Gun of comparable energy will be in the hundreds,
since its bore is related to the discharge energy. If the PAW had
its bore close to 1/8th its length, it would also have a crew in the
hundreds.  But the minimum crew is only one, not per-length or
per-megajoule, so you wind up with widely differing crew levels.

This also shows up with lasers, since they seem to only to require
a crew of one if crewed at all, no matter how big it is.

That means if you build a laser spinal mount (a laser lance with
megajoules comparable to big PAWs or Meson Guns), it only requires
a crew of one, no matter how big.

In fact, they seem to have given no thought to lasers as anything
other than small secondary weaponry. But check this:

At 40,000 Mj, a PAW has a maximum PV of 1000.  However, if you\'re
willing to make the armor thick enough (and this is fairly cheap
and easy in terms of space and cost), you can stop it.

A Meson Gun of the same energy will have a maximum DV of 1000, but
due to the way they work will have an effective range far shorter
than a PAW. In addition, a sufficiently powerful Meson Screen will
make hitting an Impossible task.

Now get this.... A 40,000 Mj laser will have a maximum DV of 500,
but it will have an effective range out to whatever it can hit (50+hexs)
and will slice through armor like it almost wasn\'t there.
The penetration rating will be 1/160, so it will only lose 7 DV
chewing through 1000pts of armor. That leaves 493 to do internal
damage, and you don\'t even have to bother with any silly ole\' screen...

Without some effective countermeasure, big lasers become the best
way to deliver damage to a target. Even with MFD-linked sandcasters,
you need a lot of them to stop this kind of damage.

What\'s needed is heavy-duty sancasters.

I disassembled the basic turret sandcaster into three components:
workstation, cannister magazine, and sensor/launcher package.

I don\'t have my "build your own sandcasters" list here, but
I simulated barbette and 50-ton bay sandcasters by using multiple
turret casters.

The barbette had two launchers, one crew workstation, and without the
need for the second workstation the magazine could hold an extra
seven volleys.  Whatever the number of dice rolled for a turret
sandcaster for DV reduction, you rolled twice that many dice.

The 50-ton bay worked out best with 18 launchers, one crew workstation,
and it worked out that this also produced room for an extra seven
volleys in the magazine (note that one "volley" is 18 cannisters for
this bay, or 2 canns for the barbette).
If I remember right, at TL-10 it would on the average stop the
40,000 Mj laser above completely, or at least mostly.

One thing that becomes important with this is how the laser sensor
works.  Does it just know that you\'re being targeted, or can you
determine which ship or how big a weapon is targeting you?
If the former, you might wind up blowing an awful lot of canns
on small lasers, lest you risk getting hit with a big one.

Glenn (a player in my campaign) and I noticed some problems in the Slug
Rifles and Carbines table (page 8 of the "Upgrade Booklet").

The 7mm Rifle (TL-5) is listed as having a magazine of 20/0.317, and an ammo
price of 0.44/9.8 but when we multiply it out, we get 20*0.44=8.8
(aparrently a typo).

The 7mm Civillian Rifle (directly below) is listed as having a loaded mass
of 4.967, an empty mass of 5.077, and an ammo mass of 0.44 (suspiciously,
the same ammo weight for 5 rounds that the military rifle has for 20
rounds).  The ammo weight when we calculate it works out to 0.11 (another
typo).

Are there any more errors in the errata?  We don\'t know, but I\'m thinking
that there might be.  Stay alert!  Trust no errata!  Keep your laser handy!

    'body' => 'The recent survey results posted here show one thing rather powerfully, at
least in regards to the Traveller fans on this list; the Third Imperium still
holds a lot of interest for a lot of people.
  Knowing that the powers that be at GDW read this, I would like to address
this to them, and explain why I feel that a Third Imperium sourcebook would be
valuable at this stage in the development of TNE.
  1.) A lot of the older fans of Traveller still want to use the Imperium as a
backdrop for their adventures. Even I, as vociferous a supporter of the New Era
background as I have been, find myself wanting to run side adventures in the
"Classic Traveller" setting. I think this is more than just nostalgic longing;
the Imperium is a very compelling idea. You folks did a great job of making it
live as a setting for science-fiction roleplaying. Many people feel that there
are still stories to tell there. Traveller has a loyal fan base unlike any
other I\'ve seen in gaming except AD&D; a third Imperium sourcebook would be an
acknowledgement of those long-time fans.

2.) By virtue of both Traveller\'s long absence from the forefront and the fact
that TNE is essentially a new game, a lot of people will be experiencing the
Traveller universe for the first time. Many of them will not be inclined to go
and ferret out the older materials to get a sense of the rich history of the
universe. I have found that understanding that history actually enhanced my
enjoyment of the current materials. A Third Imperium sourcebook could be
written as a history book; "this is the way things were; this is what we lost."
It would bring new players "up to speed" with the universe better than the well
written but neccesarily breif sections in the TNE rulebook do.
  I\'m not asking that GDW support the Imperium setting beyond a sourcebook;
that isn\'t neccesary. Perhaps a licensee could be found that could do that.
Maybe they could even do the sourcebook. for that matter. But I really do feel
that it would be a good idea, and I\'m fairly certain it would sell.

The following are just a few possible entries in the local starport news
files:

HEALTH WARNING
An outbreak of  Pharenaemia has occurred in the Garibad system. Travellers
intending to pass through the system should contact the starport pharmacy for
supplies of the latest innoculation. Anyone having visited Garibad within the
last twenty days should contact their personal medic for a check-up. The
symptoms of Pharenaemia are: stomach pains, followed by severe diarrhoea for
up to five days. The virus which causes the disease is easily transferred by
touch (sweat and other bodily fluids).

AIR POLLUTION WARNING
Air pollution levels have risen by 17% as the planet enters the summer cycle.
All off-planet visitors and persons of weak health are advised to wear their
face masks at all times. (Off-world visitors should check that their
accomodation has suitable filtering on its air-conditioning systems).

FUEL CONTAMINATION
The starport has been advised that a single tanker of starship fuel was
accidentally contaminated with metallic impurities during refinement. The
appropriate fuel bunker has been totally filtered but ships which have
refuelled in bays 19-48 will be visited by a port Technical Inspection team
within the next twelve hours. These ships should not, under any circumstances,
switch their power plant out of \'standby\' mode until the team has checked
their fuel. Legal redress is already being sought with the fuel suppliers.

MISSING PERSON
Minor John Garlick Roberts, age 14, is missing, believed run-away. It is
thought that he may have gained entry to the starport in the hope of stowing
away on board a ship. Imperial edict 1032.6c prohibits the unauthorised
transport of minors; the crew of any ship discovering the minor is required
to hold him and contact starport security immediately. Aiding the minor in
any way is a criminal offence. The minor\'s parents have offered a reward of
CR5,000 (Nb$7,546) for his safe return. Stpt Dat Ref: 87623/NM2 for a full
description and holograph of minor.

TERRORIST WARNING (CUSTOMS SEARCHES)
Following the bombing of the Excelsior hotel (06:45am this morning) the
starport has been informed of the possible presence within the port of one or
more members of the Umis terrorist group (Red Soldiers of Death) believed
implicated in this monstrous attack. All starships due to leave port are
required to be searched by a starport security unit prior to leaving their
bay. Crews are warned to report any unauthorised personnel entering their
bays or observed in suspicious circumstances elsewhere in the port. Do not
attempt to restrain any such suspects - the terrorists are believed armed
and dangerous. Updates will follow. Please cooperate with the security teams.
The starport administrator would like to apologise for any delays this may
cause.

The following is intended to provide some ideas and background
for referees running Star Vikings campaigns.  Is it of any use to
any body?

In 1115:

Quarry DI2933 B99A343-F    Ni Wa Lo Rs A      104 Im M9 V

     RS Alpha, on Quarry in Diaspora P (Khulam), was a large
underwater research facility investigating the diverse marine
ecology of the planet.  It also served as a test bed for a number
of advanced submarine craft and equipment designs -- non-military
in nature, of course, but high-tech and with potential
applications on other water worlds.  Additionally, the basic
research conducted here promised exciting payoffs in terms of
underwater techniques, technologies, and a better understanding
of water worlds in general.
     The pre-Collapse population of Quarry consisted primarily of
scientists, technicians, and starport personnel.  The planet
itself has a 98% water/water ice surface; its atmosphere has a
high oxygen content requiring protective equipment to prevent
oxygen intoxication.  A large moon exerts strong tidal forces on
the planet and, like most water worlds, the planet itself is
subject to violent, tsunami-like storms.
     It is assumed that the scientists of RS Alpha were evacuated
or departed Quarry sometime during the Hard Times.  The starport
is known to have been hit several times by corsairs.  The
possibility exists, however, that some equipment at RS A was left
behind, and, due to the underwater location of the station,
remains intact and available for recovery by RCES personnel.

     RCES administrators admit that this is not a very likely
possibility, but are willing to assign a small team to recon the
station, cold recover interesting (and portable) items of
equipment, and tag anything else for later extraction if such a
course seems worthwhile.  The PCs\' team is given the mission,
such data as is available (the above notes), and some TL 8-12
SCUBA gear.

REFEREE\'S BACKGROUND:

In 1200:

Quarry DI2933 X99A252-3    Ni Wa Lo         B 404 Wi M9 V

     The player info given above is incorrect in one respect:
the station was not completely evacuated, even in the face of a
nominal Solomani occupation, repeated corsair attacks on its
starport, and the Virus.
     Among the research endeavors here was a gene-mod program
intended to produce an amphibian human strain capable of extended
periods of underwater activity.  A small population of these
"mermani" exists, along with the descendants of their intended
"trainers" -- the intelligent dolphins genginereed by Terrans
during the Second Imperium.  The mermani now roam the seas in
small family groups, basing themselves around islands, reefs, or
on small boats; their dolphin partners serve as guides, scouts,
and occasionally "mounts" (actually, the "rider" merely holds on
to a set of reins and is pulled along behind the dolphin, if you
can believe that).  The mermani do not have gills, but can
somehow "hold their breath" for periods of up to 12 hours.  They
have large webbed feet and webbed hands, no external ear, and
flattened noses which reflexively "seal" when underwater.  They
otherwise resemble standard strain humans.  Their hearing extends
into the range utilized by their dolphin companions.
     Other communities of standard strain humans exist on some of
the scattered islands on-planet; the largest is at the ruins of
the starport.  These natives are somehow immune to the harmful
aspects of the atmosphere--PCs may chalk this up to adaptation,
but it is actually the work of self-replicating "scrubber"
nanomachines, living as symbiotes in the natives\' bloodstreams.
A Quarrian blood sample might be the most valuable thing a Star
Viking team could recover from this world, as it would be
possible to breed the things for injection into other humans.
However, the nanomacs aren\'t 100% safe -- sometimes they cause
problems for their host (see Adventure Plots, below).
     The natives at Starport Village are the descendants of the
scientists who survived the Collapse here on-planet.  Realizing
their predicament, the original survivors emphasized establishing
a viable low-technology culture.  The present government relies
on "Consuls" selected by a consensus of the community (there are
no elections as such; a man or woman of sufficient experience or
talent is simply acclaimed or accepted as Consul, much as
Kentucky colonels were once appointed).  Education, in addition
to survival skills, provides most children with a grasp of basic
science.
     The Starport Villagers rely on a local seaweed to create
alcohol-based fuel for their generators and other equipment
(mostly fabricated from material scavenged from the starport) and
have a small cache of TL 15 sensor and commo equipment, including
a handheld densitometer and an NAS set.  They may be willing to
sell these, in exchange for items of real or practical value.
The decision to sell, however, will be made in council if at all,
and there will be a faction against the trade on principle.
As a community, the Starport Villagers are practical, honest, and
level-headed, with a great deal of pride in their heritage as
scientists and challengers of the unknown.  The referee can
either play it straight, or play \'em for laughs:  imagine
Gilligan\'s island where _everyone_ acts like the Professor.
     The site of RS Alpha is about 100 km from the small island
on which the starport existed.  It is on the sea floor, several
hundred meters beneath the ocean surface, near where the seabed
slopes abruptly downward into abyssal deeps.  It is essentially a
framework of cylindrical modules, each about 10 m in diameter and
50 m long, linked by elbow-, tee-, and cross-shaped connectors
and laid out in a haphazard, almost maze-like configuration.

UPON ARRIVAL

     Detecting the research station\'s location from orbit is very
difficult with standard sensors (Formidable: Sensors).  Reduce
the difficulty level by one if the crew uses a densitometer while
scanning.  However, the first pass over the planet will detect IR
signatures from the old starport consistent with a low tech
chemical power plant of some kind.  Apparently, this world has
survivors!
     If the PCs stay in orbit for more than a few hours, it is
possible that the Starport Villagers will use relic technology to
send a radio message to the PCs ship.

     "Come in, alien ship...come in...this is Romeo Sierra Alpha,
calling unidentified craft in orbit...how do you read, over?"

     The referee must decide how likely this is; the villagers
will have to detect the ship through a dense atmosphere using
only TL 3 telescopes (unless the referee decides that one of the
Consuls has a pair of relic binoculars).

GETTING TO THE STATION

     At this point, it is up to the players to decide what to do.
If they were unable to detect the station\'s location, they will
have to go the natives and ask.  If they have located the
station, they may or may not contact the natives, either before
or after investigating the station.  Possibilities:

1A)  The Starport Villagers know of the station, but not its
precise location.  However, they have contact with the mermani,
who trade with them, and will introduce the PCs and act as
translators and help them negotiate with the mermani.  They may
demand some form of consideration or remuneration, and it is
possible that the deal could include some of the high-tech cache
owned by the Starport Village.

1B) While negotiations are under way, the daughter of one of the
Consuls (as the leading men and women of the village are called)
falls very ill with the "lung sickness".  The disease is
mysterious and almost inevitably fatal.  Its symptoms are
consonant with oxygen shortage or hypoxia.  If the Arsies can
cure her, the Consul will be very grateful and help the team
however he can.

[This is a good way for the players to discover the nanomacs the
natives possess.  Apparently, the girl\'s symbiotes are not
releasing sufficient oxygen into her bloodstream; she is short of
breath and will eventually lapse into a coma.  Brain damage may
occur if a cure is not found.  Possible options include filtering
the girl\'s blood so that it is free of nanomacs (though this
would mean that the girl can no longer live on her world without
a filter mask) or giving her a transfusion of normal blood with
healthy nanomacs.  The referee must decide whether any of the
player\'s plans will work.]

1C)  The mermani will agree to lead the PCs to RS Alpha, but will
not enter, as they believe it to be cursed.  In exchange, they
will demand some "strong ocean medicine"; that is, an item of
technology which can be used underwater and which is truly useful
to an essentially sea-dwelling culture.  If the PCs can\'t think
of, or do not possess, such an item, the mermani will swim away,
muttering about starmen who will not share their magic.

                                    OR

2A)  The land-dwelling Quarrians know where the station is, due
to old maps and journals, and will provide transport to the site
(via a small but seaworthy sailing vessel).  Dangers en route
include hostile mermani attacks, large flying predators, and
mechanical difficulties with the Starport Villager ship.  Once at
the location, the Quarrians promise to remain on station as long
as possible, but (see those clouds?) a storm seems to be on its
way.

2B) During the dive, the PCs are attacked by either some sort of
marine predator (perhaps a marine filter that moves by hydraulic
jet propulsion, sucking in anything that happens to be in the
way) or a "vampire sub" -- use the stats for PR 317 robot on p.
262 of the TNE manual, but give it only tranq ammo and call it a
"remote piloted submersible".

     In any event, the PC team will eventually arrive at the site
of the research station.  They make their dive, and discover....

INSIDE RESEARCH ALPHA

     The following possibilities are presented for referees to
consider as examples of what might await the team inside Research
Alpha.  In most cases, the team will enter through an airlock or
a "diving chamber", in which divers enter an air-filled module
through a hole in the floor, which (from inside the module) seems
to be a pool of water.  In some cases, the team will be able to
enter through a hull breach.
     There are a few interesting and potentially recoverable
items here, including perhaps a TL 15 auto med, two or three hand
computers (Virus nests?), deep sea diving suits (as protective),
TL 15 vehicle batteries intended for submersibles (100 hr
duration), and whatever else the referee feels is reasonable.
     If the referee has any remnant NPCs he wishes to introduce,
the medical low berths in sick bay are a good place to put them.

1)  The station was hit by a Suicider virus which destroyed the
station\'s data stores and automated systems, but left everything
else largely intact.  The scientists were able to evacuate to the
planet\'s surface fairly easily; while the station is dank, dark,
and cold, there are no bodies or other signs of Virus-committed
mass murder.
     The team will have to find and restore power to the basic
environment and life support systems unless they prefer to rely
on flashlights.

2)  The station was hit by a Samson-strain virus which not only
scrambled data but flooded some modules, raised oxygen levels in
others in order that a spark would cause an explosion, and caused
remote submersibles to ram still others.  The team may be able to
enter through a hull breach.  There are bodies in most of the
modules and full life support cannot be restored to all modules.

3) The station was hit by an Empire Builder virus which is still
active and which will attempt to lure the PCs into a trap of some
kind -- generating a woman\'s voice over the intercom:  "My God,
is there somebody there?  Please come help us, we\'re trapped!"
Canny PCs will be put on guard, and the Virus will attempt to
kill or drive off the intruders by flooding chambers, raising and
lowering air pressure, or whatever else you can think of.  The
PCs should be able to find and destroy the Virus\' location in the
main computer, but they should feel as if they\'re racing the
clock to get there.  The Virus may have other tricks up its
sleeve, as well, perhaps including labor droids now wired for
mayhem, so to speak.

WRAPPING IT UP

Once the PCs have finished exploring the station, they can take
what they want and head back to their ship.  The referee may
introduce complications as desired, including offended native
sensibilities and natural disasters.  Otherwise, they return to
base, where members of a rival NPC team make fun of them for
going on a "cakewalk mission".

Darrian \'psionics\':
        The Traveller alien module 8 on Darrians has very little
(read no)
information on Darrian psionics.  But it seems to me that the
Darrians
should have advanced knowledge of psionics for the following reasons:

1) They have a very advanced brain physiology, having a thicker
\'corpus calloseum\' than other species of humaniti.
2) They are close to the Zhodani Consulate.
3) The Solomani settled Darrian space before the times of Psionic
Suppression came.  Also, the Aslans settlers are capable of psionics.
(there is a table for this in Darrians, go figure)
There are 2 chirper worlds close by.
4) Darrians are curious by nature, and would certainly submit
something
like psionics to scientific study.

        For all these reasons, it should be easy to find a psionic
institute using the Darrian\'s research networks.  I would give a DM
+2 to
find an Institute over there.

5) Darrians are allies of the Imperium and share some of the same
views.
6) Darrians consider anything as difficult to control as Psionics to
be
dangerous to their society.  (Remember the Maghiz? :)

        For these reasons, Psionics in Darrian society would be
regarded
with very extreme disgust.  Psionic researchers and especially
research
subjects must submit to many controls and gain many licenses, before
they can go on with the experiments.  Psionicists without a license
may
be subjected to emprisonment pending investigations on their past
activities and psionic talents.

Special talents:
Because of their metabolic adaptibility, Darrians should get a DM +1
when rolling to see if they get the Awareness skill.
There is a rumour that Darrians can mask their infrared emanations by
manipulating their metabolism.

        Mmm, also, is it possible that except for their headdress,
Darrian women can be mistaken for men unless they are pregnant and
milking?  Just a thought. :)  It might explain somehow why the Aslans
got along well with the Darrians.

        ***
        On another note, I received the Subsidized Merchant and
Patrol
Cruisers figurines.  I had to wait for at least a month because no
distributors keeps them in stock (here in eastern Canada anyway), but
the
Akkigish-class Merchant (4.50$) was worth the wait.  It\'s
well-detailed and
has a good size.  The cruisers were a bit flimsy for my taste.
Rafm should come up with various 3-character packs soon.

Along the same lines as this would there be enough interest in Third Imperium
historical sourcebooks?  There are lots of periods of interest present in what
is known about the Third Imperium\'s past and I for one would happily purchase
sourcebooks detailing this history.

The radiation rules can be found from the Twilight:2000 2nd Edition. In the
T:2000 is also the rules for the diseases and sample diseases. I haven\'t used
these rules myself yet, but I am going to.

I have understood that movement reduces the character\'s strenght value
for recoil handling purposes.

The ammo weight works out to -0.11 if the above figures are used.  Is this

This is in response to the Quarry adventure last nights list
presented...


Most recently I was at WARPCon and though I fully intended to play
the Traveller:TNE competition..I was approached by the organiser Rob
Cosgrove (see the T;TNE credits for helpful comments and kibbitzing)
and asked to RUn the adventure.

In this adventure we (RCES) were investigating Kiepes which was a
dictatorship and the rulers nephew was kidnapped and brought to
Quarry....to the USS Montana, a 30 000 ton staship which since has
been renamed FREEPORT.
It was a very good adventure IMHO though my hasty rendition of it
didnt do it justice and it was a wee bit linear...but what the hey.

Just added that as it was last weekend and there was a quarry
adventure listed last night.....

- --A real problem I found with running a competition game is that for
those of us who really wish to try out THE NEW ERA there is the
problem of those Classic \'travellers\' who rather than being the new
starfarers on the brink of glory prefer to mull about how life was
better before they spent 80 years in coldsleep or whatever. At every
opportunity the \'oldsters\' griped about not having reactionless
drives, about how you cant mine space...(for details of this last
arguement ask me later), about how the new era is tacky and crap....

Now I wouldnt mind so much if these individuals were playing
characters from the old days but they were playing brand new
hopefuls.

I admit, when Megatraveller came out I ignored it and used my old
black and red basic set and a few A5 books which i had managed to
pick up for exorbitant prices wayback then. Traveller didnt have
background then...just pretty pictures that gave hints. The most hi
tec weapon we used was the Laser Rifle...but we had fun.

On a new subject...read this months RPI for an interview with Dave
Nilsen..line manager for the New Era...and if there are GDW people
out there...they should do a Space 1899 sourcebook in the vein of
the Cadillacs and Dinosaurs sourcebook....it may not be mainstream
but there IS interest out there and its an untapped market
especially seeing as S1899 is gone now. Besides...the hokey drive
systems from FFS could be used...ie the ones that dont really work...

This was my first post to this list this time around.

Matt.

Well, my problem is that I can\'t tell an unloaded weapon from a loaded one
(the above *should* read: "... an empty mass of 4.967, a loaded mass of
5.077 ..."), while GDW\'s problem is that they can\'t subtract (they get
5.077-4.967=0.44).

Does that help?

All I can say in my defense is that when I get tired, my tang gets all
tungled up, my finigers camr tripe, and I spoon in speakerisms.  And I did
warn you ---- didn\'t I say: "Stay no laser handy!  Trust alert!  Keep your
alert!" ... or something like that?  ;)

 One of the former Soviet-block allies is exporting something called the
 "Strike-Force" bullet intended for law-enforcement, but not restricted, yet.
 Apparently, the bullet has a "fluted jacket" design that allows the jacket
 to "peel" off the bullet (similar to the Black Talon) as the center portion
 of the projectile (heaviest "harder-lead" portion) continues into the target.
 Thus, you have several razor-sharp "slivers" peeling off in different
 directions while the main portion of the bullet (which is a patented alloy,
 with "unique physical properties that allow unequaled penetration", according
 to the manufacturer) does the most damage.

  This is almost exactly the way the gauss rilfe ammo in Classic Traveller
was supposed to act. A soft hollow point jacket with an interior heavy metal
penetrator.


  I\'ve been thinking on how to model them but so far I\'ve only reached
a conclusion for 3G3 and not FF&S: The bullet is treated as a combination
of normal hollowpoint and saboted round, it has in effect two concurrent
DV\'s. One is the straight DV from the bullet, it behaves like a hollowpoint
DV, ie 0.7 before armour and 1.5 or whatever behind armour.
  In addition there is the DV from the penetrator, this is computer as if
the penetrator was a ds penetrator (sg18 probably) and the rest of the
bullet a sabot with sg11. Divide the energy between these two components.

manufacturers (but the larger packs like the Steiner Laser unit
match better).
Star Wars figures make good civilians, military and police.  The
disadvantage is that most of the figures are recognizable as being
from the movie and this detracts from the Traveller feel.
The Battlelords line has some good figures, but many are way too
overdressed for use in Traveller.
The Aliens line has a number of very good military types and
I couldn\'t resist getting a loader for the station.
    Finally figures are where you find them.  With the new era many fantasy
and historical figures can be very useful for doing lower tech planets.
We use a number of fanatasy and horror line figures in the station as well.
Our cantina has a german feel cause we liked the barmaid from one of the
horror line.  We even used Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (they run the

They\'re sort of implied on the next page, but they\'re goofy, if my analysis is
correct:

A vessel in subspace moves at 200 .01-parsec wide hexes per turn X its
subspace velocity from the formula.  That means that a ship with a velocity of
1 can move 400 hexes per hour--that is, 4 parsecs.  So the units for the
subspace velocity formula turns out to be parsecs per quarter-hour.  Do we
call this Warp One?

Now for my real question:  What volume should be used for the fuel pellets
used by the Daedalus-type STL ship in FF&S?  Liquid hydrogen, or hydrogen
rocket fuel?  Since the fuel usage is based on mass rather than volume, it
would be nice to be able to go with the denser of the two, but the book
implies that "normal" liquid hydrogen values are used, except for the higher
cost.

It\'s not really important, but I can\'t seem to get a single stage craft that
can get anywhere in less than a millenium or so.  Anybody out there remember
"Starlost"?

Good Luck finding them!

Much of the info in the basic books (1: Characters & Combat, 2:Wolds and
adventures, and 3:    ) is simply straight rules: all are also contained
in The Traveller Book.  (I should explain that I see the value in the CT
materials as adventure background material and rules not included in the
current rules).

Other Books: Mercenary (book 4) containes "extended" traveller character
development rules (for army, marines) plus rules (sketchy ones) for large
scale combat.  Also some long-awaited (by some) heavy weapons specifications.

 High Guard (book 5) is for large scale ship to ship combat and extended
character development for Navy Characters.  Also rules for design and
construction.

Book 6: scouts has ext. character info for, you guessed it, scouts.  Also
extended world detail generation stuff (further extended by Grand Survey
and Grand Census, Third party products).

All of the above seem IMHO to be of limited use to a TNE or MT player, but
are essential if you wish to play CT.  Now for some more useful stuff.

Book 7: Mercenary Prince: lots of trade and commerce info.  Very useful for
its "Cargo Contents" charts to a MT or TNE player.

Book 8: Robots:  I was so excited when this first appeared.  I wasn\'t
disappointed either.  Rules here for creating any robot you wish and
the costs associated with them.  I have not checked compatibility with
TNE (I don\'t think I want to know) but to me the rules seem to stand
perfectly well on their own two feet (or however many feet you wish to
add).  Volume is expressed in liters and weight in Kg, so adding TNE
equipment to a CT generated robot shouldn\'t be a problem.  (the problem
actually is lack of reactionless drive in TNE for CT robots using grav
as motive power).

Supplements:  of course I do not remember all of these; There were something
 like 20 of them.  I will break them up by usefulness.

Useful;

76 Patrons: Quick adventure ideas with introductions and a character sketch
for each Patron, plus 3-4 possible outcomes.

Traders & Gunboats: Deck Plans for several standard trading vessels, a System
Defense Boat (with a jump module) Close Escort (Gazelle) and scout service
vessels (X-Boat, X-Boat Tender, Scout/Courier).

Azhanti High Lightning contains Supplement 5 and is an excellent source
for adventure and has detailed, large deckplans for a 60,000 ton cruiser.
(a pretty good MT adventure called Arrival Vengence uses the same ship and
also provides _some_ of the deck plans in a much smaller format).  I have
also heard that the AHL boxed set is very expensive when it is available
at all.

The Spinward Marches : starmaps for said sector

The Solomani Rim : as above; both are, of course, pre-rebellion but are
perfectly serviceable in MT and TNE.

Library Data A-M
Library Data N-Z  : one is diminished in value without the other, lots of
data is simply good source material for adventures.  Some is voided by
the MT and TNE history.


Not so useful (Unless you\'re playing CT)

Citizens of the Imperium : character generation for several non- or
para- military careers.

Fighting Ships : lots of military vessels in High Guard format.  Some neat
some silly.

Animal Encounters : I didn\'t use this too much when I _was_ playing CT.  That
may be my fault though.

Veterans :  A list of characters with their stats in CT format.  Good for
off-the-shelf heavies.

That\'s all I can remember at the moment; I have probably missed at least one
important one; perhaps others can fill in my memory.

Adventures;

I have not found a single adventure that _could_ not be useful.  Every one
of them had either deck plans or maps which could be adjusted to some other
venue.  Here are a few tested ones;

Adventure 1: Kinunir : setting is a 1000 ton frontier cruiser.  An excellent
vessel with drop tubes, several subcraft (including a fusion armed G-carrier)
two particle accelerator barbettes.  Good ship.  Unfortunately a bit too
good for characters to use.  Makes a great setting, however, and if you
do a bit of damage and allow a substandard character engineer to do repairs
everything can malfunction constantly-restoring some game balance.
Incidentally inserting quite a measure of amusement (at least for the GM).

Nomads of the World Ocean : the cultures in this one seemed to play
especially well.  It included specs for a few water-craft too.

Signal GK : contains deck plans

Research Station Gamma : deck plans for lab ship.

Annic Nova : good aventure ideas, deck plans and ideas for a totally
alien vessel

I\'m sure other people can review other products so I\'ll stop now

Hope this helps...Pete

Merchant Prince.

I believe this included power plants which burned hydrogen, producing
waste water and giving us the first robots in SF history which had to
stop and take a leak. :-)

Especially if you bear in mind the computer\'s limited artificial intelligence
which, in the hands of a creative GM, should also provide some game balance.

great having a battlecruiser to play with!"

propable that the ship would have at least one malfunction per jump.
T:TNE says that if the malfunction occurs, it can cause the jump drive to
malfunction. Now, if the jump drive malfunctions it usually ceases to work
and shuts down.

The real problem I have is: what happens next? Does the ship need constant
output from the jump drive, then the ship would drop out from the jump space
in the middle of nowhere. If the ship only needs the start boost and then
drops out from the jump space according the course, then the ship would
return from the jump space normally at the destination and is not able to
jump before the repairs are made.

I think that the ship only needs the star boost or there would be lots of
wrecks between the stars and star travel would not be very cost effective.
But I hope somebody can tell me how the jump drive -officially- works.

 Re; Mike Basinger, who wants  to know which books of old lore to look for.
             (Sorry-new mailer with copy command coming soon!)

   Well it\'s good to see that T-TNE has gotten at least one person interested
  in Traveller. I haven\'t actually met any of the hordes of them GDW keep
  telling us exist- maybe it\'s better in the colonies :)

   Now- which books you might want to look at depends on what you want to
  know (wow- what a profound statement).  If you wanted to see what the old
  Traveller rules were like, then you would have to check out a lot of the
  old Classic Traveller books Peter Brenton mentioned yesterday, and most of
  MegaTraveller, and then you would probably find that Classic Traveller had
  the best rules and end up playing with rules written 15+ years ago...
  (ha ha only serious)
   However, I assume that what you want is information on what the Imperium
  was like before Skippy the Virus reduced it to dust, to help you actually
  play the game, so I\'m just going to mention a few books that may help

  1) Anything by Digest Group Publications, ie
     MT Aliens Books 1+2            - info on 2 important races per book
     The MegaTraveller Digest 1-4   - big magazines
     The Flaming Eye                - Rebellion Era adventure book
     World Builders Handbook        - more world details and survey rules

     This stuff is probably your best bet, since it\'s fairly recent, DGP did
    some of the best stuff ever written for Traveller, and it is unlikely to
    be republished by GDW soon. Not many superceded rules in them either.

  2) For a guide to the Imperium, look for either the CT Supplements 8+11
     that Pete mentioned, or it could well be easier to find the MegaTraveller
     book \'The Imperial Encyclopedia\' - one of the books in the MT box but
     available seperately. Basically a revised reprint of the earlier Library
     Data Supplements.

  3) For a guide to the Rebellion, try the MegaTraveller book \'The Rebellion
     Sourcebook\'. Not perfect but lots of background, and it\'s better if you
     don\'t have the piles of older material it repeats. And Survival Margin
     of course....
  I\'ll stop there before the list gets too big. It really does depend on what
  you want, and how much effort you are prepared to spend finding it.
  Really, except for the old adventures it\'s probably not worth getting
  any CT material (even if it hurts me to say it). MT gives you most of the
  same information but is easier to find. Peter Benton gave a good guide to
  what\'s worth getting from the good old dsys if you are able.
  WARNING- There is a dangerous product still on the loose, called
  \'Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium\' for MT. This product should not
  be approched. Not a single ship design is error-free, and it is of course
  useless for TNE. Report to the Errata-Police if found.
   Finally- If you have any general Traveller questions don\'t forget that the
  TML is full of old Traveller players for whom the phrase \'GET A LIFE\' means
  rolling up a new Traveller character- what more background do you need?

        Anyone else got \'I\'d even murder the previous owner\' books?

being unwilling to ask any questions until I am sure that the question hasn\'t
already been discussed/answered.

However, I saw an opportunity to add to the discussion of the CT materials:
books, supplements, and adventures...

Peter Brento covered several things to answer Mike Basinger\'s request, here
are my thoughts/additions:

I have almost all of the supplements and rule books for CT.  I also have
almost all of the JTAS up through about 18 or thereabouts, and the bulk of
the Challenge mag that replaced it.  I am still using deck plans from those
resources in my TNE campaign I\'m running now (and will until GDW publishes
new deckplans).

I agree with Peter that just about all of the adventure books have useful
things.  The Double Adventures had a bunch of neat things:

Mithril/Bright Face described the basic ATV very well and had some
interesting environments to travel through.

Marooned/Marooned Alone had some good survival stuff and described the
survival kit.

Death Station/Argon Gambit had some deckplans - don\'t remember if a lab ship
or an interdiction station.

full Adventure Broadsword gave deckplans for the 800 ton mercenary cruiser,
and had some scenarios suitable for Striker (the miniatures rules -
predecessor of FF&S).

Also, there have been a ton of stuff from 3rd parties for CT.  Judges Guild
and FASA both put out a lot.  FASA had some excellent supplements with
Striker vehicle designs and equipment books, and their Scouts and Assassins
book came out before Book 6 and includes a different outlook on Scouts (you
gotta love the "Tin Hemorrhoid").  They had a couple of really good
adventures: the Sky Raiders trilogy and another with an odd title where the
characters are basically Lawrence of Arabia on a alien planet (train the
desert nomads with their vaguely Muslim religion and fight the oppressors- TL
5 and 6 mostly).  The only I ever purchased from Judges Guild was a
supplement of starport maps, but it was kinda neat.  Also, there was some
alternate mags - High Traveller for example - that had either a world or a
adventure detailed in each...

I guess that is enough for now - have fun!

Traveller Newspaper Update:
- ----
I\'ve gotten several more submissions for the newspaper. Thanks to all those
who have provided articles and ideas so far. More items gratefully
accepted. It will be a little while yet before I get it all together for a
publication though - life has become a bit busier just recently.

Advertisements for new & used equipment have been useful extras I have
received. Anyone doing an FF&S design might like to include some sales
blurb in their submission to the list, and I\'ll include in the paper.

What was the name of the minor race that looked like big rhinos with

boxed set also had one, along with an Ael Yeal (sp??), another

Where is the original material on them?  I think it\'s in An Issue of

They were the Virushi; and are detailed in _The Journal of the Travellers\'
Aid Society_ (Issue #12) and were written by J. Andrew Keith.  They are
native to Virshash, an Imperial world in Reavers\' Deep.

     They are detailed JTAS #12.  Strength and endurance are rolled on 1D+10

They were called Virushi, and my copy of the Contact! where they first
appeared  is in Best of the JTAS 3, which means it was originally
published in one of JTAS 9 to 12.  Great minor race, big as a K\'kree in
battle dress, and v. gentle; also v. stubborn, there is no way you are
going to easily make one of these things do something they don\'t want
to.   The article says they originate in Reaver\'s Deep, so maybe whoever
was creating the T:TNE pocket empire in that region will know more.  Did
DGP re-publish the information in the Traveller\'s Digest?

They are (were?) the Virushi. Home planet in Reaver\'s Deep sector, as
far as I recall. They appeared in a Contact: article in JTAS #16 or
thereabouts -- I don\'t know if it ever got reprinted elsewhere.

They were interesting as NPCs and to add colour to a campaign, but
nobody in the campaigns I was involved in ever made use of them as PCs
- -- they were extreme pacifists and not too maneouvrable to boot. Hope
this helps ...

Just to add to the CT adventure list, I have used the Divine Intervention
(double) scenario to teach players how to do a military infiltration job
_without_ blowing away everyone (if the bad guys know the players have been
there then the mission will fail). Also the Night of Conquest (I think that
was the name; might be the other half of the Divine Intervention booklet) is
the opposite: the players get caught between two TL5-6 warring nations and
probably HAVE to blow their way out.

I cannot rate highly enough a combination of 76 Patrons (CT) and the small
adventures from the original (A5-size) Travellers\' Journal; in total a huge
number of adventures, all of which can be played as minor sidelines and
distractions or fleshed out into complete scenarios.

I agree with the FASA Scouts & Assassins comment: Tin Haemhorroid awards
are a favourite, and you get the extended Scout ship design and deckplans.

When mentioning supplements (CT), I would add 1001 Characters (pregenerated
NPC stats) although stats is all you get. Still useful for those \'1d6 Thugs\'
random encounter rolls.

Did anyone mention the Traveller Digest magazine? It\'s an extortionate price
over here but the material inside is good. :)

Our White Dwarf magazine used to have a few Traveller articles (good one
on starports) but that was years ago when it used to do AD&D; before it
became a flagship for Warhammer 40k and Space Crusade.

  First, my entry in the \'name the minor race\' game- the big rhino things
 are Virushi, from Virshash/Urlaqquash  (Reaver\'s Deep 2724). I think they
 were in one of the first four JTAS, and the first \'Best of\'- unfortunately
 I have none of them. I think there was a short article on them in one of the
 later Digests, but it may just be memory playing tricks on me again...

 Next, for the person who asked about Maintanence Points on Starships- don\'t
 try and use the rules as written-  I mean they were intended for Twilight
 2000 (...washes mouth out....)  so you could work out if your Jeep would
 break down as you fled across Europe shooting commies. They have no relevance
 to Starship Ops at all- GDW, as usual nowadays, wrote a naff rule. It will
 (probably has) been fixed in the Errata (boxed set available soon :) or you
 could just wing it- ie ignore it unless the ship is undermanned or behind for
 overhaul, if so then roll only once per week of system use- it depends on how
 dangerous you think worn-out equipment should be. Warn you players :)

  Notes-
     FMA is a major weapons maker on Medurma (Dagudashagg Sector), and as well
     as the usual military equipment produces toys like this- Medurma has a
     freer availability of weapons than most Hi-Pop worlds due to the presence
     of a duelling code, even if most weapons are intended to be non-lethal
     (the code is partly a result of assimilation of Aslan culture). For more
     detail see Signal-GK the fanzine.

(1) I join my voice to Lucifer\'s in asking for equations for the Hull
Size table.  I have a pretty good idea of how they SHOULD be worked out,
but some of the figures don\'t seem to match.  For example: a rate 1 hull
has a volume of 14 m^3.  Given V=4/3 x PI x r^3, this gives r = 1.495 m
or so, so the diameter ought to be 2.99 m.  Taken against the 3.2 m
given in the book, this is a 7% error - too high for implementation.
What gives?  Similar problems arise for the material volume
calculations; I\'m assuming you take the volume of a (x) metre sphere,
and subtract it from the volume of a (x + 0.01) metre sphere, but again
it doesn\'t seem to work.

(2) Thermonuclear pulse drives.  Fuel efficiency is not "one order of
magnitude higher".  It\'s 0.000333 tonnes per tonne-hour of thrust,
just a little better than the fusion rocket\'s 0.0005 tonnes per
tonne-hour.  Is there a standard erratum for this?

(3) AZHRAE.  Has anyone managed to design a tech 9 AZHRAE ship that can
reach orbit?  My assumptions:

* I\'m using the ramjet fuel consumption figures, since the turbojet mode
isn\'t used for long, and the rocket mode consumes a LOT more fuel.
* I\'m ignoring such things as hull mass and controls, and just working
out whether the engine can get itself into orbit, given that it has to
accelerate all the fuel it\'ll be using.
* I\'m assuming I need 0.64 G-hours to reach orbit (p.71).
* Rather than integrate a fuel consumption equation, I\'m splitting the
burn time into tenths (p.71 again).

Variables

mf = mass of fuel (tonnes; assumed HCD @ 1 tonne/m3)
me = mass of engine (tonnes)
T  = thrust evolved (tonnes)
   = 6 x me
FC = fuel consumption per hour
   = 2 x T
   = 12 x me
BT = burn time (hours)
   = mf / FC
   = mf / (12 x me)

So far, so good.

m* = fuel mass remaining at time t
   = mf - FC x t

A  = acceleration (g) at time t
   = T / (me + m*)
   = 6 x me / (me + mf - (12 x me x t))

So if I integrate this from t = 0 to BT, I should get the total g-hours
of thrust.  Right?  Well, taking specific cases, I\'ve found that the
total thrust seems to peak at 0.614371 g-hours, when mf/me = 7.23 or so.
(Note that the ratio seems to be the only important part - well, that\'s
fair enough.)  Also, this thing can only burn for 0.6 hours, making it
pretty much useless for long-distance flights.  What I\'m aiming for is a
NASP as in Dark Con; I realise that I\'m never going to get Mach 25
performance under the existing rules, but this problem seems very odd.

Any thoughts?

Hello.  This is my first post to the mailing list, so forgive any etiquette
problems.  I have been reading the list for a couple weeks now, and have a few
questions for all the Traveller players out there.

1. I own a decent amount of CT (Books 1-6, some adventures, etc) and
   a fair amount of MT as well.  I am considering buying T:TNE, and
   was wondering if it is worth it.  I would buy the Deluxe box, and
   would just like to know if it is worth the money.  (The local store
   is having a sale :-)).

2. Is the Fire, Fusion, and Steel book good?  I like tech stuff, and
   like to design things, so from what I have read it sounds
   interesting, but I\'d like to hear a first hand opinion.  How big
   is the book (pagewise), etc.

3. Is the game system in T:TNE similar to CT and/or MT, or will I have
   to learn a whole new system?

4. Are there any sourcebooks available for the system?  Also, what
   sourcebooks are planned for the near future?

5. Lastly, are there any Traveller campaigns in the Purdue area that
   are looking for players?  Because I\'m dying to actually play...

That should be about all for now.  Thank you in advance to all those who reply.
I appreciate the help.

Again, another question I can comment on!

The Virushi were described in JTAS #10.  They are very large centauroid
aliens that resemble rhinos to some degree.  They are described as
"centaurs with tank blood" or "intelligent bulldozers", but are very
pacifistic.

I can try to scan in the article if you really need it.

(and yes, I remembered the name before I went back and found the article!)

Every jump takes about a week. In that time a starship can have about 21
potential breakdowns. A starship with wear value of 6 have a 60% chance
of actual malfunction 21 times per jump. So it suffers averagely 1.26
malfunctions every time it jumps from one system to another.

TNE als says:

Because misjump usually occurs when using unrefined fuel, I think that most
malfunctions occur in (jump) drives. If the malfunction occurs in jump drive,
what happens next? A malfunctioned jump drive propably shuts down and ceases
to work and drops down from jump space (if jump needs constant output from
the jump drives). In that case the poor ship (and its crew) ends up somewhere
in space and can\'t jump because nobody knows where they are and don\'t have
enough jump fuel. Have you ever considered how many starships are out there
ended up in space between stars because their jump drives malfunctioned?

Anyway I\'d like to know how the jump drive works -officially- in TNE and
how to handle the malfunctions.

  The Deluxe box is pretty good bang for the buck.  It includes a *BIG*
main book, which covers a lot of ground.  It can\'t however cover over 10
years of previously printed Traveller material.  One of the biggest lacks
is details on Alien PC generation.  It does however have a good character
generation section.  Explaination of skills, three mini-adventures, a
decent equipment section, some common vehicles and spacecraft.
  The box also includes errata for the book.  The book needs errata, but
it\'s a lot cleaner than the old MT books.

The book is good.  There are some holes but in all it\'s fairly good.  I\'ve
designed a TL 5 cargo Zeppelin and small arms from TL 5 to 9.  I\'ve seen
some good grav vehicles come out of it (posted here).  I\'ve heard some
complaints on designing small helos though.

  The mechanics are the same GDW\'s TW2K/Merc2000/DarkCon/C&D.  What they
call the `House Rules\'.  I\'ve seen a lot worse (Space:1889 springs to mind).
The system isn\'t overly complex.  You should be able to pick it up quickly
if you understood the MT rules.

>4. Are there any sourcebooks available for the system?  Also, what
>   sourcebooks are planned for the near future?
  FF&S is the basic source book out now.  GDW has posted a release
schedule here and in Challenge.  You sound in good shape with all the CT
and MT stuff you have anyway.

    'index' => 'al254',
    'body' => '
Since there were some questions about FF&S starship designs in recent issues
of the TML, I thought the following might help.  This is a complete and
detailed, step-by-step guide to building FF&S hulls.


OK, let\'s get unconfused on this hull issue.  Going into FF&S, I see:

"As indicated above, the base values for hulls assume a spherical shape.  As
all hulls of the same rate have the same interior volume, hulls in less
space-efficient shapes than spheres will have more surface area, greater
length, and require more hull material to achieve an equivalent volume.  The
Hull Form and Configuration Table (pp.12) indicates the various hull forms
available and the effects on length and material volume."  ---- FF&S pp.10

"Note also that the hull form will affect the surface area of the hull.
Note at this time how much surface area is available.  Surface area is used
for the attachment of weapons, sensors, communicators, launch ports, etc.
Keep a running record of how much sirface area is used as the ship is
designed." ---- FF&S pp.11

Unfortunately, the explicit formula for surface area *isn\'t* included, which
makes things confusing.  Here\'s my take on the whole thing:

Hull Plating:

AVmin = (Gmax * 10)
where AVmin is the minimum armor value for the hull, and
Gmax is the maximum allowable accelleration in Gs

Hpv = (AV / Thm) * Mv * Mvm
Hpva = (AV / Thm) * Mv * Mvm * 1.3
whereHpv is the hull plating volume (in m^3)
Hpva is the hull plating volume (in m^3) for airframe hulls
AV is the desired armor value (but not less than AVmin)
Thm is the toughness of the selected hull material
Mv is the hull material volume from the Hull Size table
Mvm is the MV modifier from the Hull Form & Configuration table

Hpm = Hpv * Mhm
Hpma = Hpva * Mhm
whereHpm is the mass in tonnes of the hull plating
Hvm is the hull plating volume in m^3
Mhm is the mass of the selected hull material
Hpma is the mass of the hull plating for airframe hulls
Hpva isthe hull plating volume in m^3 for airframe hulls

Hpc = Hpv * Sm * Phm
Hpca = Hpva * Sm * Phm
whereHpc is the hull plating cost in MCr
Hpv is the hull plating volume in m^3
Sm is the streamlining modifier from Hull Form & Config table
Phm is the price of the selected hull material
Hpca is the cost in MCr for airframe hulls
Hpva is the volume in m^3 for airframe hulls

Hsa = Mv * Mvm * 100
Hsaof = Mv * 100
whereHsa is the hull surface area in m^2
Mv is the hull material volume from the Hull Size table
Mvm is the MV modifier from the Hull Form & Configuration table
Hsaof is the hull surface area in m^2 for open frame hulls

Hl = L * Lm
whereHl is the hull length in meters
L is the length of a spherical hull form the Hull Size table
Lm is the length modifier from the Hull Form * Config table


Interior Structure:

Isv = (Mv * Mvm * Gmax) / Thm
whereIsv is the interior structure volume in m^3
Mv is the hull material volume from the Hull Size table
Mvm is the MV modifier from the Hull Form & Configuration table
Gmax is the maximum allowable accelleration in Gs
Thm is the toughness of the selelected hull material

Ism = Isv * Mhm
where Isv is the interior structure mass in tonnes
Mhm is the mass of the selected hull material

Isc = Isv * Phm
whereIsc is the interior structure cost in MCr
Phm is the price of the selected hull material


The total available interior volume of a hull is given on the Hull Size
table.  The volume of the hull and the internal structure are subtracted from
the available interior volume (both the hull and the interior structure take
up space inside the vehicle).  The mass of the hull and the interior structure
are added to the total mass of the vehicle.  The cost of the hull and the
interior structure are added to the cost of the vehicle.  The surface area
of the hull plating is the available surface area for mounting weapons,
electronics, and other components that require surface area.  The length of
the hull is used to determine characteristics of certain sensors, defenses,
and weapon systems.


Does this help clear things up?

    'body' => 'There are actually two problems with the wear and breakdown rules as
presented in T:TNE.  The first, as someone on the TML noticed, is that even
a wear 1 starship has an extremely high chance of generating a fatal
breakdown at some point during a week-long jump.

The following entries from my T:TNE errata file should help the situation:


NIT: pp.241, Potential Breakdowns
The wear and potential breakdown rules are presumably to be applied to
starships as well as other types of equipment.  However, there is a rather
sticky problem: consider a starship in jump space.  If the ship\'s power
plant fails, life support will stop, and everybody aboard the ship will die
in a number of hours.

Fix: Unlike vehicles, starship systems are be designed for 24 hour a
day, 7 day a week performance.  Roll for potential breakdowns twice per
week (once on leaving orbit, and once on exit from jump space) instead of
once per 8 hours.

Alternate fix: Assume the starships vital systems (power plant and life
support as a minimum) have integral multiply-redundant internal backups, so
that breakdowns are not life-threatening unless ignored for more than a
week.

Commentary: There are 21 8-hour periods in a typical 7 day jump; for a
power plant with a wear value of 1, this is a 74.5% chance that a potential
breakdown will occur within the first 4 days of the jump.  Assuming that
the engineer has a relevant asset of 10, there is an 87.5% chance that
there will be an actual breakdown sometime during the next day.  Overall
about a 65.2% chance of a power failure sometime during the jump.
---- GG

NIT: pp.242, Increasing Wear; last paragraph in the section suggests
generating wear values for individual components of a vehicle.  When
keeping separate track of the wear value individual components separately,
care must be taken to keep the combination under control.

Fix: When tracking the wear value of components separately, the referee
should assign wear values that are no greater than the overall wear value
of the vehicle.  Each period, only one die roll is made.  It the number
rolled is greater than the overall wear value of the vehicle, no potential
breakdown occurs.  If a potential breakdown does occur, the referee must
randomly choose one component from all those components with a wear value
less than or equal to the number rolled.  As component wear values change,
the vehicle\'s overall wear value is the same as the highest wear value of
any of the components.

Commentary: For example, a vehicle with wear value of 5 is broken down into
4 components, each of which are given a wear value of 5.  If 4 rolls, one
for each of the components, are made each period, there is a 93.75% chance
that at least one of the components will have a potential breakdown each
period; effectively a wear value of 10.  With the fixed rules, potential
breakdowns still occur only 50% of the time.

dangerous than before. The boxed set should also have the newer rulebook with
all the corrections.  FF&S is a book I enjoyed a lot also. I haven\'t gone
over all the design rules so I can\'t comment on the faults others may have
found. I used Brilliant Lances for Starship construction with no problem.

The one thing I did notice is that Plasma and Fusion guns as starship weapons
are gone.  Read the articles in Challange 71 to see why laser and starships
are the way they are now.

One question for everyone out there. What do you all think of the Starship

I didn\'t even notice the omission.  What I would use as a guide are either CT
or MT items or check out Cyberpunk by R. Talsorian Games.  I\'ve tried a few
weapons conversions and the stats are converted easily enough with a little
though. for example a traveller armor value of 1 AV1 is roughly equivilent to
a Cyberpunk SP of 20.  Other Cyberpunk supplements might be very useful also.
Deep Space would be a good depiction of TL8-9 space hardware. And Maximum
Metal has some awesome armor esp. the powered armor.

I\'ve noticed that FF&S\'s cyberware chapter conforms closely to Cyberpunk
equipment.

I hope this helps.

One last comment.  Games like Cyberpunk give the GM\'s a lot of specific info
(like manufacturer, model number) where Traveller has always left that up to
the GM to devise.  I prefer the Traveller method.

 Actually, all I ever did was convert then-current NYC metro prices

Subject: Flechette in FF&S

Our gaming group has only recently had access to FF&S and the new weapon
tables. Someone noticed the stats for a 2cm LAG firing Flechette:

                                                _Recoil_
                          ROF  DAM  Pen Blk Mag  SS  Brst   Rng
                          ----
2cm LAG Flechette(Short)  SA    24   1   6   5    2    -    210
    Medium-Long           SA     1  Nil


Is this for real. If so, this will toast people in battle dress! I didn\'t
think flechette rounds were quite this effective.

Is this a mistake?

Any helpful comments from the list appreciated.

Well, a 10-ton fighter massing abt 75 tonnes or so and moving 42 km/sec
is about 7E13 joules, 70 terajoules.  Around 10 megatons.  Even assuming
a very glancing blow that only delivers about 10% of that energy to
the target ship, that\'s having a megaton class explosion on your outer
hull, which puts even the far end of most midsized space stations within
the total destruction radius.  I don\'t think a bunch of rolls quite
covers the scenario; more like "Set the Character Sheets on Fire".

>BTW, do fighters have ejection seats? :)  I think I\'ve been
>way too generous with players who pull extremely stupid stunts. :)

Mine do, for various reasons.  These little tiny 2 ton escape capsules,
in fact...

However, you should consider the difficulty in tracking down all the

their side won the battle and has time to track them all down.

    'body' => 'Hi,

In answer to the query about costs of basic items in Traveller (i.e. food,
accomodation, etc.) I definitely advocate the pound/dollar to credit
algorithm. If you set a credit value at about 50 UK pence or 1 UK pound per
credit (in the US: 50 cents or a dollar) then you have a very easy
conversion rate that both yourself and the players can use.
It means you don\'t have to get out a calculator (either to convert from
dollars to pounds, or from our currency to credits) and thus the players
can instinctively get a feel for whether a planet seems expensive (or if
they\'re being ripped off).

I see no point in making up a big list of items with prices. This _is_
required for a game like Dungeons and Dragons where the relationship between
cash and items is not so clear to player or referee. But in Traveller, you
ought to be able to make do with a direct 1:1 conversion of local (UK/US)
currency to credits. To add spice, either consult the trade tables in the
MT Players (or TNE equivalent) or just roll 2D for a price variation:
Roll Price Adjustment
 2   -50%
 3   -40%
 4   -30%
 5   -20%
 6   -10%
 7     0
 8   +10%
 9   +20%
10   +40%
11   +60%
12   +80%
13+  +100%
For the player who\'s buying, ADD any reaction adjustment by the seller (if
he doesn\'t like the character, add between 2 and 4 points to the roll; if
he is enchanted by the player, deduct a couple of points); then DEDUCT any
appropriate player skill (bribery, liaison, carousing, possible admin, legal,
broker, etc.).
Note that just like the real world, the table is biased towards getting as
much money as possible out of the characters. The seller will never drop
his price below 50% unless he\'s selling you something which doesn\'t work and
isn\'t even worth its value in scrap - he\'s no fool (unless he has a
particularly low Intelligence, in which case... well that\'s up to you!)

I\'ve made a stab at converting my Campaign Ship to FF&S/TNE format.
So here it is, the whole design sequence just the way GDW likes if: it
shows each calculation, and can serve as a guide for others.

This ship is an attempt at converting the Azhanti High Lightning Class
Cruiser, originally presented in Azhanti High Lightning (808), with
Suppliment 5, Lightning Class Cruisers by Frank Chadwick and Marc
Miller.  A MegaTraveller conversion was presented in Arrival Vengance
by Greg Videll w/ Dave Nilsen.

The basic design peramerters were as follows for the Frontier Cruiser
config:

TL 14, 60,000 ton Hull, Jump 5, Manuever 2, a TL 15 Spinal Meson Gun,
24 TL-15 50-ton Partical Accellerator Bays, 100 triple laser turrets,
100 triple sandcaster turrets, 80 Fusion Guns, Nuclear Dampeners, A
Black Globe, Meson Screens, 2 launch tubes for 20-ton craft, hanger
space for 60 fighters and 6 gunboats, and 4 400-ton fuel shuttles.
Various Docking capibilites were specified in the CT version, but did
not appear in Arrival Vengence.  I\'ve gone with the CT version.

The Fusion Guns are no longer a space combat weapon (the plasma/fusion
bolts don\'t travel at close to light speed: please don\'t ask me about
this one, physicks = magick to me ;-) )

I would LIKE to have a Large Nuclear Dampener that can stop all
incoming missles, but since FF&S doesn\'t contain clear rules for this,
I went with a number of Dampener Turrets. I\'d replace them at the drop
of a hat ;-)

About the 50 ton bays: Even if you can pack multiple Partical
Accelerators into one bay, they don\'t really have the penetration to
effect big ships.  I would, to make the ship more survivable (as
opposed to being true to the old design).  A TL 15 50 ton Laser Bay
would have a DV of 125, and would be able to penetrate an AV of 5000.
This type of bay would be a MUCH better ship killer than the Particle
Bays.  But hey, my players think they have Particle Bays.

I\'ve tried to indicate where the formulas diverge from FF&S, and where
the errata came from.

PLEASE if you find any errors in this design sequence, please let me
know.  I hope that others can use this to make ship design easier of
new designers.

All items TL 14 unless noted otherwise in the text.

{ The CT form was "Close Structure", and the MT form was "Box"
I chose Slab because it matched the picture on the box ;-) }
Hull Configuration: Streamlined (Streamline Modifier (Sm)=0.7

(Note Well: the Surface Area is dependent on the Material Volume from
the Table, NOT the Final Material Volume as indicated in the
Traveller\'s Player Forms. This has been confirmed by either Dave
Nilsen or Loren Wiseman in e-mail to a member [who??] of the gdw-beta
list.  If it WERE based on the FMV, it would be essentially free,
volume-wise).

I used interpolation to find the values for TL-15.  If interpolation
between TL is illegal, than the values are wrong and will need to be
recalculated. I basically took the average between the two values.

c. Fire Control
{From the way the original batteries were set up, I would say that
there were 10 MFDs each for the Lasers, Sandcasters, and Missles,
1 MFD for each Particle Accelerator, 1 MFD for the Meson Gun.  Nuclear
Dampeners weren\'t arranged in batteries before, but since I assume you\'d
want to be SURE you\'d hit with one, I gave each one a MFD as well.
Also, I couldn\'t see anything that indicated that Sandcasters could
use MFDs.   Because I have multiple fire control decks, I multiplied
the number of MFDs x4, (except for the Nuc. Damp. MFDs) for redundancy.}

Pencil beam sensors for MFDs multiply the power requirements and antenna
size by 0.1 and the cost by 0.5.  The volume and mass remain the same.

7. Power Supply

I arrived at a power need of 73,775 MW through my spreadsheet.  You
should actually perform this step AFTER the Manuever Drive step,
unless you want to allocate Power Plant specifically for the drives.

Vol= MW of Desired Output/ MW of Output per Cubic
Meter=73,775/3=24,591.67
Mass=Vol. of Plant x 3 = 24,591.67 x 3 = 73,775
Price=0.2 x Vol. of Plant = 0.2 x 24,591.67 = 4918.33
Fuel= MW of Output x 0.1 = 7,377.5 kl/year

The Players Forms are quite helpful for this section.
Thrust Megawatts = 0.5 x Hull Displacement (tons) x manuever Gs
60,000=0.5 x 60,000 x 2
Acceleration Rating Gs = (ThMW x 2)/Hull Displacement Rating
2=60,000 x 2/60,000
Reaction Mass = ThMW x 0.25 m^3 per hour = 60,000 x 0.25 = 15,000 m^3
G-Turns=maneuver Gs for 21 hours x 2= 42 G-Turns.
Volume= 21 x 15,000 = 315,000 m^3

Recombustion Chamber for HEPlaR
Vol= 0.1 x MW of Power devoted to Thrust=0.1 x 60,000 = 6,000
Mass= 1 x vol = 1 x 6,000 = 6,000
Price= vol x 0.001= 6,000 x 0.001 = 6 MCr
Surface Area = thrust (tonnes)/200 = 20 x 60,000 / 200 = 6,000

I have not seen TNE rules YET.  When I ref a CT/MT game all of the
starships have triple redundancy (three of every critical components).  That
means they can have system failures without possible leaving the party in an
irrecoverable position.   Sometime the backup system might not be 100% so the
system might have to be \'tweaked\' or \'babied\' until they can repair the primary
system that has failed.  This way I can keep my players busy without possible
endangering the game itself.

pierre-louis constantine <constanp@DMI.USherb.CA> was asking how to handle
ship to ship collisions.
My suggestion would be to simplify the physics into a two body collision at
right angles. In that case the 10 ton fighter would have about 8,820,000,000
kilo Joules of Kinetic energy to disperse. Compare with equivilent laser
damage and you\'re right. That would hurt!

for the curious: Kinetic Energy = .5*m*v*v
               m=mass in Kg  1 ton = 1000Kg
               v=velocity in m/s
               also 1 Joule = 1 kg * m * m / ( s * s)
               thats 1 kilogram meter squared per second squared.

Overly simplified but should give a ball park figure.

Also missiles are now X-ray laser weapons not kinetic kill weapons. (see
reasoning in Challange 71 )
Maybe a particle beam is a better model for distributing collision damage?

     I was reading through some of the old bundles and I noticed
that a few people were as puzzled as I was by the cryptic
reference in _Survival Margin_ to "Meridian 78, Prime Radial".
     What, pray tell, could that be?  Let\'s see:  It\'s obviously
a *place* (nice work, Bill) -- referred to in terms of some
coordinate system that you and I have never heard of before.  The
word "radial" seems to indicate some sort of polar system, and
therefore "meridian" must be the distance along the radial.
     Given that this is true, we have three problems.  1) What
units do we measure meridians in?  2) What is the prime radial?
and 3) What is the point of origin?  [Note that we don\'t care
whether radials are measured in degrees, mils, or percent of pi;
we just need to know what 0 is in this system].

Three Assumptions:
1)  That meridian 78 is 78 parsecs from the origin.
2)  That the prime radial is the direction to the galactic core.
3)  That the origin is Capital/Core.

     That means that meridian 78, prime radial is....Meshan 2120.
Does this tell us anything?  I don\'t know.  I don\'t even know if
there\'s a _planet_ in that hex.
     Of course, any one of my three assumptions could be wrong.
Meridian 78 may be 78 ly from the origin.  The prime radial may
be in a different direction.  The origin may be somewhere other
than Capital/Core.
     Of these three assumptions, the one that seems the least
firmly grounded is the point of origin.  Suppose the origin is
Kaggushus (that is, _Hub_/Ershur -- this coordinate system is an
old Second Imperium convention) or even Reference (as in point of
reference -- get it? :) )  These are closer to the "center" of
the Imperium, and meridian 78 in either case would be right on
the border in Lishun sector.
     This actually makes more sense than if Capital is the center
of this coordinate system.  The message then becomes:  "Heads up,
Strephon!  That thing you and I were talking about before is due
to arrive on your doorstep in 90 years."
     But you can be damn sure that Norris\' heirs are going to
launch a mission to intercept whatever\'s coming (There\'s a New
Era adventure idea for free --  "Arrival Vengeance II:  Into the
Wilds").  And whoever\'s running the show in the Black Sphere
might know about it as well, and think it a real good excuse to
come out and play.
     So the question is:  what will the crew of this Arrival
Vengeance mission find at Rad 0, Mer 78?  I\'m voting for Lishun
0305 as its location...any other candidates?
     Couple of other questions:  Why has the Black Sphere gotten
bigger (and messier) from Survival Margin to the T:TNE rulebook?
And what the hell is Humphrey Bogart doing dressed up as a Star
Viking (p. 244)?

     I\'ve been thinking about a New Era pocket empire that uses
psionics...and I mean _really_ uses them.  Picture, if you will:

     After the Collapse, the Psionics Institute on the central
world came out of hiding and took over, aggressively recruiting
and developing the psionic potential of the younger generation as
well as inculcating them with a sense of mission and/or manifest
destiny.
     The psions, by virtue of a breakthrough in the research
they\'d been conducting for the Imperial Navy, then constructed a
few of those psionic-transfer drives from the alternate tech
section of FF&S, installing them in some relic hulls.
     After seventy years, they\'ve managed to conquer or
assimilate most of the worlds in a four or five parsec radius
(why, that\'s practically a *subsector*)...and now they\'re ready
to expand.  They\'ve got psionic idiots-savant instead of
computers, they ain\'t afraid of no Virus, and they think they\'re
the _real_ heirs of the Third Imperium.
     Perfect for the nemeses in your Star Vikings campaign, since
the Zhodani are just too darn far away.  The RCES just wants to
recover old technology...but these guys are the former Imperium\'s
version of the Butlerian Jihad, for one, and they want young,
talented minds to train as sort of interstellar janissaries.
Rather a cross between the Zhodani and the Borg.
     Center this pocket empire on Terra, and you again have
Solomani that you can love to hate.  Call them Nusolomani, or
Solomani Nuevo, if you like.

     [Note that, as written, PT drive ships spend one hour per
parsec in jump...which makes them much more strategically
manueverable than their opponents.  This is a neat idea, with
interesting ramifications, even if you change the formula to 1
day per parsec jumped (as I suspect is a good idea).
     However, PT users have a much tougher time crewing these
ships with psipilots than standard shipowners have with regular
pilots.  Therefore, the psions would have a greater tendency
towards "smash and grab" tactics of the "hit \'em where they
ain\'t" variety than even the Star Vikings... because they have to
warm up the drives for hours before they can jump, and once in
normal space they\'re evenly matched with their opponents (at
best).
     So they\'re tough, and _spooky_ --  "How the hell did that
ship get here?  Last we heard..."  (See _A Talent for War_, the
author of which I disremember, for some ideas about this) -- but
not invincible.]

     Or, hell, make \'em Droyne.  I don\'t know if Grandfather
would approve, but you could do it.
     Or you can use the Psionic Pocket Empire as your campaign
background to run that Adventure on Arrakis ("...the only source
of naturally occurring psi booster in all of known space...")
you\'ve been thinking about.

     [BTW, you can say that the PT drive doesn\'t really break the
"one stardrive per universe" law, since you can call it a version
of psionic teleportation, albeit amplified, which already exists
in a standard Imperial campaign.  On the other hand, if such is
the case, then why haven\'t the Zhodani discovered it?  Maybe they
have, but don\'t use it because jump is more economical from the
standpoint of resources and personnel availability...but then why
does it make sense for our pocket empire?  Maybe the Zhodani just
weren\'t desperate enough.  Oh, well; if you like the idea, you
can justify it.  If you don\'t, than you don\'t _need_ to justify
it.]

Speaking of psionics:

     Q.   How fast do telepathic signals travel?  Speed of light?
     A.   Check out _Survival Margin_ p. 7 and tell me if it
          implies what I think it implies.

I remember reading about the first gyrojet firearms.  They
were supposedly developed for situations similar to France and other
occupied countries during WWII.  Light, cheap, easy to parachute-drop
into occupied countries for the resistance fighters, but also easy to
control, since they used a unique type of ammo only available from a
single source (the U.S.).

This was in a generally nifty book about the future of weapons
technology - although I think it had a quote in the front of the book,
from Einstein that runs "World War III will be fought with atomic
bombs; World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones." (I\'m probably
mangling this horribly - I read it back in 1985).

First, I need to also credit the gdw-beta list for help on the
Lightning design, especially Guy Garnett and John Bogan for their
helpful suggestions, and Allen (Shock?) for his encouragement.

Peter Brenton asked if I was using 20 ton fighters instead of
Ramparts.  The ship was designed so that it can carry 20 ton fighters.
I figured this would be more flexible, and also it would fit the
original concept of the gunboats being fired out the launch tubes.  My
concept was that the ship would carry 9 ton Ramparts like those in
Brilliant Lances.

The Gunboats are designed to be flexible craft: transport, troop and
fighter recovery, recon, and occasional heavy space support (the
turret in the gunboat is about twice as dangerous as the laser lance
on the Rampart).  The Gunboats are not meant to be primarily fighters.
I think of them as being similar to a large helo for a surface ship.

I will post soon the operational aspects of the Lightning Class,
although essentially I\'ve tried to make them as much like the CT
versions as possible.

If all my posts are annoying you, please let me know:

mgood@mit.edu

and I\'ll stop ;-)

although I don\'t anticipate any more huge posts anytime soon.

time somebody started an alt newsgroup? (alt.games.rpg.traveller?)

Hi, Rodge here:

In reply to Allen Shock\'s query about various Traveller products,
I\'ve learned a little that might interest you:

In a phone call to GDW about their Imperial Lines newsletter (it
has been cancelled as of issue #2), I also learned that Challenge
#72 should be hitting stores by the end of February.

The ref\'s screen should have hit the shelves by now.

As of Aug. 31, 1993, GDW\'s release calendar looked something like this
(source: AAB Proceedings #22):

   Path of Tears                Jan 1994
   Smash and Grab               Jan 1994
   Vampire Fleets               Feb 1994
   Vehicles Book                Mar 1994
   Brilliant Lances Express     Apr 1994
   The Longships                May 1994
   Striker II                   Jun 1994
   Vampire Ship                 Jul 1994
   Free Trader                  Aug 1994
   Aliens of the Rim            Oct 1994
   TNE Armory                   Nov 1994
   World Tamer\'s ________ ??    Dec 1994

According to the person I talked to, they\'re about 2 or 3 months behind.

I have written most of a PC Windows-based MT character generator.
It will generate Army, Marine or Navy characters using the _advanced_ MT
rules. I\'m hoping it\'s a bit more advanced than anything previously seen:
each \'random\' event - assignments, resolution, etc. - you get to roll
the dice but you can also opt for automatic success or failure, \'high\' rolls,
use of Brownie points, etc. On assignments, skill rolls, etc. you can ignore
the dice roll and just pick the option you want.

What I wanted to do was to upload this simple version to TML and, if people
like it I might do some more work on it. If GDW liked it, perhaps they\'d like
to pay some nominal sum (I\'d settle for a few thousand dollars or c. 40 pounds;
the latter would allow me to buy TNE & FF&S) :) to do a complete program
including all the basic character types and possibly the racial specialities
(as detailed in the Vilani/Vargr and Solomani/Aslan supplements). If they
sent me a free copy of the deluxe TNE (including the 1 mod 1 updated rule
books, of course) I might consider writing an equivalent program for TNE ;)

I don\'t know how many people out there use Windows on PCs but I\'d be very
grateful if anyone who is interested, and downloads the program, could give
me some feed-back (directly rather than filling up TML) on errata, usefulness,
etc. The program is TCH.EXE (a self-extracting ZIP v2 file) and is found as
follows (thanks for the info James):

Host Symbolic:ftp.engrg.uwo.ca
     Numeric:129.100.100.12
     Alias:sunbane.engrg.uwo.ca
Directory:/pub/traveller/software
File:tch.exe

I must emphasise it is only an _alpha_ test program intended to get feedback.
However, any comments are appreciated. One last point, I could only fit
everything on the screen if run in 800x600 mode (16 or 256 colours). If this
really mucks things up for a lot of people I\'ll try to squeeze the next
version into 640x480.

TO CAT USERS/MEMBERS:
I did send off to join you guys and got two confirmatory messages back but
I can\'t remember where to mail or anything. If any of you are watching this
space, please contact me! Obviously this program may be more appropriate to
yourselves and I\'d like to get in touch again.

If there\'s anyone from GDW out there, I\'d appreciate your comments as well.
Are you looking for an equivalent TNE character generator?

See ya round,

Hi, Rodge here.

A Nazi-based empire would work well in TNE.  You could have the homeworld of
the players invaded.  Or better yet, give the Star Vikings a bit of their own
medicine -- or much worse.  But who\'s the "Adolf Hitler" behind it all?  How
about a mutant strain of the Virus that became fascinated with the history of
Germany and the Hitlerian regime, and then went power crazy.  Sig Heil!  Who
would be the jews?  Aliens of course (hivers, etc.), their allies (RCES
agents), and anybody else who got in the way!

Long live the Virus!

My reply to that was:

:I strongly disagree with your claim about playing New Era in the Regency.
:Playing in the Regency is indeed a viable option, and for die-hard Imperium
:fans, offers the best environment for roleplaying in the New Era.
:
:As for venturing into the wilds from there, getting into and out of the
:Regency is not that hard.  The border blockade is only 6 or 7 systems deep,
:and patrolling the deep space (empty hexes) between occupied systems is not
:only NOT easy, it is near impossible, meaning that by stockpiling fuel in deep
:space, you could easily cross back over into the Regency after leaving it. I
:assume black marketeers and pirates do it all the time.  Even the Virus could
:use this method, which means that very strict contact protocols would have to
:be mandatory throughout the entire Regency.

Jerry, again:

- ----

Like I said previously, getting in and out of the Regency ain\'t that big \'a
deal.

If I\'m not mistaken, the sensors on starships can only scan a few light
seconds at best in every direction.  Even if sensors could "see" light MINUTES
away, it would take many thousands of ships to canvas the 3+ light years in a
single hex (there are 525,600 minutes in a year).  And that\'s just with a
linear defense strung out across a 2-dimensional plane.  If you take into
account the 3 dimensions of space, well, then your blockade would need to take
the shape of a planar grid, so square the previous number of ships needed.
And if you take into account that alerts must be sent by ship, then you need
more ships to man the front while the reporting ships travel to and fro.

Now, let\'s say our ships have super sensors that can detect up to light years
away.  The data received is still only travelling at the speed of light and
will therefore be as old as the distance the data travelled.  Any data on an
intruder received from over a few light days away would probably be useless
(as the vamp would likely be long gone by the time you even detected it, and
you wouldn\'t know where the detected intruder jumped in from, or where it
jumped out to).

And if by some magic, you\'ve aquired sensors that can detect objects faster
than the speed of the light emitted or reflected by objects detected, then
you\'ve just developed a non-starship FTL communications system, and have
blown the main underlying premise of the game (that there is no communication
faster than the mode of travel).

Inorder for any "blockade" of the Regency\'s space to work, extremely strict
protocols and quarantine procedures would need to be in effect throughout ALL
of Regency space, not just along its edges.  A smart virus (I assume some of
them are much smarter than humans) could theoretically figure out what the
defenses of the Regency were, fly right in, sneak past or fool the guards, and
wreak havoc.  (Hey, not a bad adventure idea!)

As for inspections, well, what if the vampire ship couldn\'t care less about
inspections?  It might never land, but could still attack!  You\'d have a very
dangerous corsair on your hands.  With properly orchestrated supply lines
(deep space fuel caches), a vampire ship would be hard to stop from getting
in, and once in would be hard to stop period.  A vampire FLEET could be
devastating.

Then there are the "listening stations".  If strategically located, such as
near gas giants to prevent vampire ship refuelling and near stars to prevent
solar re-energizing, ambush patrols could prevent blatant attempts to
cross-over into the Regency.  But when you take into account the alternate
methods of refueling, such as taking water from ice asteroids or comets, or
transforming matter into energy with a black globe, point defense becomes
infeasible for protecting against these methods of entry, and you have the
problem of scale (the number of ships needed to canvas the area concerned
being to great) once again.

I assume the Regency has held up so well over the past 80 years because it has
been lucky enough not to be in the vicinity of the really dangerous virus
mutations, such as the "Empire Builders".

    'body' => 'Traveller:TNE does carry information on colliosions between
starships/aircraft. It is located on pages 301-302 in the Planetary Combat
section. The collision damage is equal to the tonnage times the net speed. A
random roll is used to determine hit location. The damage value is used as a
penetration value versus the hit location\'s armor value, the result being
used on the vehicle damage resoulution table.

So A Rampart fighter travelling at 42kps and hitting a stationary cruiser
will have a penetration factor of 38,503,500. 42 kps = 210 km per 5 second
combat turn and the mass of a Rampart being 183.35 tons unloaded. At any
rate, 38 million points of damage should wipe out almost any ship.

Also looking if FF&S. Couldn\'t we also consider the colliding ship to be the
projectile of a Mass Driver?  This approach might have some merits as it will
give the ship a penetration value of it\'s energy in Mj times 4 (PV=Mj x 4)
646,858,800 = 161,714,700Mj x 4. About 17 times more damage that the
collision procedure given in the rulebook. So I guess that the rulebook take
into account the loss of energy through structural collapse.

Sorry if I beat this topic to death :-}

The orders the RCES players are getting are becoming
more and more Imperialistic and violent.  Pretty soon
(or eventually-depending on how the GM plays it) they
begin to realize that the gov\'t of the RCES has changed
due to the machinations of the charismatic president.

After awhile the "President" declares herself
"President for life" or somesuch.  The rest, as they say, is
history (or herstory).

The players may react in one of several ways;  Altruistic
or goody-goody players will somehow express outrage over
the atrocitys being committed (not to mention their own
orders) and will, in the end, divorce themselves from the
RCES, presumably hijacking some equipment along the way.

Other players (the normal characters) will need to be \'pushed\'
out of the RCES.  The point being to make the PCs Anti-Coalitionists.
This could be difficult in some of the campaigns I have played.
I have known *Characters* (as opposed to those who played them)
who would have done almost anything to become \'personal assistants\'
to leaders like the one described above.  Although this also has
adventure opportunities, I wouldn\'t want to give Traveller the
reputation D&D got when it was found that \'Devil Worship\' was an
important possible aspect of the game.

To me this opens up a LOT of possibilities.  How about an
anti-smash & grab????  Prop up a democratic leadership
that the RCES (now Nth Reich or somesuch) is trying to
topple.  Run arms to planets taken over by the RCES to feed
rebellion.

I think under any of these circumstances the PCs will need a \'base\'
to work from, and some NPC support; traders in the wilds, a gov\'t
on a threatened planet, etc.

I think I would probably use a blasted hulk of a large warship as
a base to work from (probably Matt\'s Azhanti High Lightning update).
This would give an overall goal (scrounging parts to make the thing
operational) a good defensive, but somewhat mobile base (keep 20% of
the weapons and 1/2 G manuver).  Besides, I have the deck plans.

btw   Hitler was BAD.  He was evil, but playing a game with a similar
person as a _character_ is not a bad thing to do.  Exception: I would do
nothing to idealize the evil leader if there were an immature person
playing the game (i.e. 16 yr old or less).

The Forever War (by Joe Haldeman) included a fairly detailed description of
G-Tanks.  His ships accelerated at extremely high G rates (like 25 G\'s),
and the troops and crew were protected from this in a couple of ways.  They
wore pressure suits in a chamber that filled up with fluid.  The chamber
itself was pressurized up to the equivalent pressure of 2 nautical miles
under sea, and the people wore suits that countered this pressure (included
pumping a fluid INTO them).  The only problem here was that while in the
chamber, they weren\'t interacting/controlling the ship.  The computer ran
the ship during high G maneuvers.  There were a limited amount of crawling
units that were 1 man acc-chambers, but they were only mentioned, not
described.  One of the weird things was that the fluid that was pumped into
you was a fluorocarbon mix, and it filled up your lungs and every thing.  I
guess you basically "died" to some degree??

A couple of other short stories had G-tanks of sorts, typically water or a
denser fluid, and you required life support equipment.  However, these were
intended for lower G tolerances (like 4 to 6 sustained).

One of the interesting things I see is that the standard G-comps just
reduce to 1 G.  Several things I have seen in studies and pseudo-science
novels (those with large basis in fact) is that people can endure and work
in higher G settings for extended periods of time.  So, if you had 3 Gs of
compensation, you could accelerate at 5 or 6 Gs and not lose any ability to
work at a workstation (seated, manipulating controls).  Now, of course, you
wouldn\'t want to move around too much, and you would get fatigued faster,
but you could do it.

Just some thoughts!

watched ROBOTECH...the Sentinels.....well the invid travelled in
thier pods didnt they and they were filled with fluid...although it
was more of a nutrient bath....another idea would be a bulky self
contained suit like the pressure suit in The Abyss....

What a GTank would look like.....basically a jacuzzi with a lid.
Scaling the densities of the liquids would be easy enough even using
salt solutions and substances such as CsCl....but to get the sort of
densities you are looking for then you are talking about heavy metal
salts and those are toxic..I can see it now....

"help Medic...the Pilots drunk his G-Tank dry and we\'re entering the
gravity well...."

A full-body suit would be advisable for two reasons.

1 When the pilot got out he would be covered in the gunk and
although salt crystals look great on tanned skin (oooer) they can be
a serious health hazard.

2 His skin would be all wrinkly and he\'d look like a prune all
over...bleah.

Now I personally like this idea as its the sort of hokey thing that
a few lower tech worlds would use. Again I\'m not sure of the exact
physics of it but it works for me as a concept and I\'m waiting to be
shot down by all those experienced Travellers out there who have

A quick calculation gives the kinetic energy of the ship as equivalent to
a 38 kiloton nuke!! I\'d certainly *hope* that\'d ruin any ship!

161,714,700/4.2e15 = .0385035 Megatons or 38.5035 kilotons :-)

For an interesting description of the pros and cons of G-Tanks, I recommend
the SF Novel \'The Forever War\' by Joe Haldeman, especially \'Sergeant Mandela\'
chapters 2 and 4 for low tech G-Tanks, and \'Major Mandela\' chapter 3 for how
they might develop.

     Joe Haldeman\'s novel _The Forever War_ relies pretty heavily
in one section upon g-tanks as a plot device, and so he describes
their workings in some detail.  Essentially, all passengers are
fitted with a valve in their hip.  They strip down, enter the g-
tank, and both the tank and their innards fill with a spongy,
oxygenated foam that somehow cushions them from the stresses of
high-g accelerations while not preventing them from breathing.
The things can malfunction, however; apparently if not properly
"fitted".

     Haldeman mentions that, while passengers are essentially
cocooned within their shells, the crew\'s tanks are mobile or
possess waldos that enable them to control the ship while in the
tanks.

     Getting in and out of the tanks is a big deal, so most of
the time his ships coast or thrust under constant acceleration.

     Some indication is also given of how the tanks get better at
higher "tech levels", but you\'d probably have to make the numbers
up yourself.

  I\'d been thinking about the recent article on psi-based
  interstellar travel, which ended with the question of why the
  Zhodani don\'t use it.  I\'ve come up with a hypothetically
  plausible explanation of the phenomenon:

  PsiJump, although not _apparently_ different from a high level of
  teleportation, is in fact qualitatively different.  There are no
  definite conclusions as to why, but the currently "accepted"
  hypothesis has to do with the involvement of other psionically
  aware minds interacting over interstellar differences.  This
  explanation is not considered adequate at this time, and research
  is continuing.

  Because of some quirk in the general psychological makeup of
  humanity (and quite likely all known sapients), teleportation and
  psijump talents never appear in the same individual.
  Furthermore, psijump is extremely rare; the typical planet at the
  height of the Imperium\'s power could be expected on average to
  produce one psijump talent in a generation.

  Worse, psijump is more stressful, even proportionally, to the
  individual than any other psionic activity.  Heavy use of the
  talent (regular commercial use - once per month or once per
  two weeks) has been shown to have severe detrimental effects on
  life expectancy even under ideal circumstances, and any kind of
  psionic mishap during a psijump attempt has a high probability
  of being fatal to the individual.

  There are no recorded instances of any psijump going to a
  destination other than the intended one.  Even when a mishap
  kills the individual, the psijump, if initiated at all, completes
  without error.  More often, the mishap prevents initiation of the
  psijump, and the ship goes nowhere.

  It is because of the high cost in life that the Zhodani do not
  routinely use this method.  However, the Consulate Military does
  in fact utilize this technique in capital flagships, as a
  last-ditch measure to get flag officers out of an otherwise lost
  situation.  This is _not_ known to the general public, nor even
  to crew members of the affected ships.

  Just my take on the idea...

Actually, the fluorocarbon mixture was based on current technology
as a replacement for air.  The mixture is used to carry oxygen and CO2
into/out of the lung.  I know they\'ve kept rats alive for periods of time
using this technique, and I think they\'v e even done dogs, as well.  The
research has lots of implications for things like smoke inhalation injury,
since the fluorocarbon mix allows a higher O2 concentration to pass the
membrane (I think, it\'s been a while since I\'ve read anything about it)
allowing the damaged lung tissure a chance to heal without drying up and
scarring.  The advantage in the tanks in _The Forever War_ was that this
equilibrated the pressure inside and out, without having nasty things like
N2 dissolving in the bloodstream.  Even helium will cause the bends at such
pressures.  The book describes that the people in the ship as sedated
during transit, as this kind of treatment would produce some SERIOUS
claustrophobia and sensory deprivation while under way.

This would, though, make a neat premise for a really alien
world...fluorocarbons instead of nitrogen as the major component of the
atmosphere. This\'d be a gas giant that humans could nonetheless walk
around on with no pressure gear.  Heck, we could probably fly by
strapping on wings and flapping. :-)  It would be LOTS of fun, from a
sadistic GM viewpoint (is there ANY other?): crash your party on the
planet, tell em their pressure gear failed.  Then wait till they\'re
halfway through rolling up new characters to say "Oh, yeah, I forgot.
You\'re all still alive!" <GRIN>  The inhabitants of this planet probably
couldn\'t survive outside of the atmosphere, though.

    'body' => 'Subject: An idea with a bug...

  I was reading Piers Anthony\'s _Triple_Detente_ today, and thought
  it would be a neat idea for a pocket polity.  I started to
  "translate" it, and quickly realized that if it\'s ever actually
  _used_ in a campaign, there are some severe problems.

  For those of you who haven\'t read the book, it starts off with a
  space battle about to come off.  The commander of the Human fleet
  discovers an alien spy in his crew, and without letting on that
  he knows, makes it known to the spy that he is amenable to
  working out their differences.  We don\'t see the actual
  resolution of the battle, but the next scene occurs on Earth,
  where the alien fleet has landed.  The aliens establish a regime
  that is on the surface cruel and genocidal, but turns out to be
  beneficial to the planet later on - in comparatively short order.
  At this point, an apparent rebel movement starts its small
  annoyance, which quickly flops.  In the process, one of the
  revolutionaries, the son of the commander of the destroyed Human
  fleet, is approached by the chief of the alien overlords, and
  asked to show an alien female around.  At about the time that the
  revolutionary realizes that the revolution has flopped, he is
  recruited by the aliens to govern _their_ world.  It is
  explained to him that fifteen years ago, at the time of the
  defeat of the Human fleet, the two fleets instead declared
  peace on each other, met, and came to an agreement that
  resulted in the Human fleet governing the alien world, and
  vice-versa.  Outside of the two "occupation governments",
  nobody knows the truth - not even the native bureaucracy.

  The book does not end there, but that\'s not important.  The dual
  occupations was the idea that intrigued me.  I had pictured
  putting these worlds in the Great Wilds, one parsec apart, in an
  area that was off the pre-Collapse trade routes because of being
  at least jump-2 from the nearest other stars.  Both worlds
  clawed their ways out of the ruins that they were left in due to
  the Rebellion and the subsequent attacks by Virus, and have
  made it back to jump-1 capability, with jump-2 visible on the
  horizon.  Shortly after they achieved jump-1 (in an amazing
  coincidence, almost simultaneously), they met and went to war.  A
  farsighted captain from one planet managed to open up a
  discussion that resulted in the kind of secret arrangement
  described above, and the result has been peace and prosperity for
  both planets.  The occupation governments have not allowed
  development of interstellar flight beyond the jump-1 level,
  because they only too clearly perceived my problem.  Other than
  that, this polity is at a solid tech-11 to tech-12.

  The problem:  The PC\'s ship is capable of jump-3.  This pair of
  planets sits across a great shortcut for their travels.  They\'re
  bound to come in for fuel, and see much in-system activity.
  Contact is almost inevitable.  No matter which planet they come
  into, they will come into contact with members of both races.  If
  they choose to visit the second planet, or if one of the
  occupation soldiers lets something slip, the PCs will quickly
  figure out just what the situation is.

  The polity\'s problem:  How to prevent the secret from being
  blown?  How do we salvage the situation if the secret does get
  blown anyway?  Can we afford the risk of not blowing away
  outsiders?  Can we guarantee that we _can_ blow away any
  outsiders?  If we can\'t guarantee that we can blow away any
  outsiders, what can we do to make it in the outsiders\' best
  interests to keep quiet?

  Other problems for the Referee to consider:  What happens when
  the RCES come calling?  Is this a government that they will like,
  or will it be "necessary" to overthrow it?  If this world is
  placed in, say, Coreward Corridor, what will be the reaction (on
  both sides) when the Regency comes calling?  Or the Ziru Sirkaa,
  if it manages to resurrect itself?

  Certainly a lot of grist for the campaign, but I need ideas on
  how to handle it.  If anyone wants the "Encyclopedia Galactica"
  entries for these, let me know, and I\'ll finish fleshing them
  out, and post them here.

   The bolt action has better range than the lever-action - all the modifiers
on that table are cumulative.  Thus, a bolt-action rifle would have a range
modifier of 1.1x1.3 or 1.43.  A lever action rifle would only get the 1.3 mod
for being two-handed.

MCr0.0005 is Cr500 (multiply by 1 000 000).

Hi, Rodge here:

I have some comments about the equipment breakdown rules in
T:TNE.

If a check for equipment failure must be made every 8 hours, then
the device can\'t have been constructed very well.  I can see how
the 8-hour rule would apply to equipment that has been sitting
around on a dead world for 80 years (due to general oxidization,
rust, and corrosion, etc.), but not for equipment from worlds
that have rebuilt their industrial base.

Put a good machine shop aboard a starship, and a skilled
technician could have the ship purring like a kitten in no time.
A dedicated mechanic wouldn\'t rest until the ship was in tip-top
condition.

I have minor repairs done to my truck only about twice per year,
and its over 20 years old!

Hi, Rodge here:

One comment about your ideas concerning gaming on the surface of
a gas giant:

The gravity on the surface of a gas giant would be sufficient to
literal crush a human, or even a starship.  They are typically
MANY thousands of times greater mass than the earth.

Theorhetically, you could build something that could withstand
that kind of environment, but humans wouldn\'t be able to go,
because the maximum G-level that can be nullified is 6 g\'s.

The main problem with pulling too many G\'s on the human body is
when the pull of gravity is greater than the heart\'s ability to
pump the blood against it to the brain.  This results in not
enough blood reaching the brain, and results in the subject
blacking out.

In extreme gravity situations, providing oxygen would be a moot
issue, because the various mechanisms of cellular metabolism
would be hampered too greatly by the force of gravity to function
properly.  Just as you wouldn\'t be able to move due to your own
incredible weight, neither would your mitochondria.

As for the flourocarbon fluid... When cells receive either too
much or too little oxygen, free radical molecular activity
increases.  Free radicals are atoms or molecules which have an
unpaired electron in orbit, making them highly reactive and prone
to pulling an electron off of an adjacent atom or molecule
inorder to re-establish an even number of electrons.  The
molecule which just lost its paired electron has thus become a
free-radical, and the cycle of electron stealing repeats itself
in a harmful chain reaction.  Oxidation, rancidity, and
autoxidation (oxidation occuring in liquid, from the oxygen
molecules contained therein).  Free-radical activity can damage
cells, and has been linked as a cause to cancer, heart disease,
acne, dandruff, hair loss, and many other illnesses.

When a person stops breathing for so long that they are in danger
of sustaining permanent brain damage, the reason is because
free-radical activity has increased due to the lack of oxygen (a
condition known as hypoxia).  The drug Hydergine, which is a
powerful anti-oxidant, prevents autoxidation and thus can prolong
the amount of time you can go without air before sustaining
permanent brain damage to as much as 10 to 15 minutes (rather
than the usual 7 minutes).  It is used by paramedics in Europe to
reduce the risk of complications caused by circulatory failure
and trauma (insufficient blood to deliver the necessary amount of
oxygen to the body).

Hi, Rodge here:

I called GDW about their back stocks, and they reported that
they don\'t have any CT stuff left.

You can call them yourself to check, if you\'d like.  Their
customer service phone number is (309) 452-3632.

I have some open statements, and some questions for you, Mr.
Giles:

Glad to see your name once again.  I thought The Security Leak
was dead.

To the limits of my knowledge on the subject, you put out
Security Leak as a Traveller newsletter first, then as a magazine
dedicated solely to Traveller, where the newsletter ran from
issue #1 to issue #3, and the magazine ran from issue #1 to issue
#5.  Is this correct?

I admit this next question may be motivated by wishful thinking,
but can we look forward to seeing your publication revived, with
forthcoming new issues?

Here\'s hoping,

I doubt that you\'re the only one who is confused about this part of the FF&S
weapons design rules, so let me help straighten things out here.  First,
let\'s take a look in FF&S, and see what the rules say:

FF&S pp.96, first column, reads: "Cm: Configuration Modifier, as shown below.
If two configuration descriptions apply to the same weapon, multiply them
together to determine the total configuration modifier."

OK, that helps.  Since the design sequence is for small arms, either the
"one-handed" or the "two-handed" modifier will *always* apply.  The other
modifiers, for "bullpup", "bolt action", and "smoothbore" may or may not
apply.  This results in 8 canonical configurations for weapons:

configurationtotal cmcomment
rifle1.3
rifle, bullpup1.17
rifle, bolt-action1.43
shotgun0.65all 2-handed, smoothbore small arms
pistol0.4
pistol, bullpup0.36not a very likeley combination
pistol, bolt-action0.44the Remington XP-100 is an example
shot-pistol0.2a 1-handed "sawed-off" shotgun?

The following combinations are not "offically" allowed (because the rules
say "two configuration descriptions", making any weapon with more than two
applicable configuration descriptions un-official).  The bullpup shotgun
in particular sounds reasonable to me for a semi-auto or full-auto
military design (sufficiently so that I\'d be suprised if it\'s never been
tried in Real Life).

configurationtotal cmcomment
shotgun, bullpup0.585reasonable for a military shotgun
shotgun, bolt-action0.715

In addition, various other unlikeley combinations are probably "possible",
but I doubt that they\'d be used.  Combining bullpup and bolt-action doesn\'t
make much sense, because this would move the handle of the bolt back to a
location that would make it very incomvenient to operate the action.
Bullpup pistols also don\'t make much sense to me, nor do bolt-action
shotpistols, so I won\'t list the cm values for these combnations.

A good, well-explained example would have helped; unfortunately, the one
that\'s in FF&S not only has very little explanatory text, but it also has
an error in this calculation.  The designer of the example has performed
the "cm" calculation correctly, but then rounded the value before using it
in the formula for short range.  This is incorrect; the "cm" value should
not be rounded before use, but the final short range should be rounded to
the nearest meter.

Corrections to FF&S: pp.155, top of the first column, the "SR" line should
read: SR = Sqrt(E)CmBlm = 69.303679 * 1.17 * 1 = 81.0853 = 81m.  This
correction changes the short range from 83m to 81m, and will affect the
other short ranges comuted in subsequent lines.

In general, this also points out a question that many non-engineers will
have trouble with.  How many significant figures should you keep in your
calculations.  As a rough rule of thumb (and the the engineers out there
will probably cringe), keep one more digit than the number of significant
digits in your answer.  This will keep any rounding or truncation errors out
where they won\'t change the results of your calculation.

For small arms ranges, our answer will be in the tens, or sometimes hundreds
of meters.  This is two or three significant figures in the answer; so we
should use three or four significant figures in our calculations.

For example, in the SR calculation above, the figures could have been kept
to three significant digits: 69.3 * 1.17 * 1.00 = 81.1, which rounds to 81.
Two significant digits (which is what the designer of the example used when
using a value of 1.2 for cm) won\'t work: 69 * 1.2 * 1.0 = 82.8, which rounds
to 83.  More significant figures that the "rule of thumb" suggests will only
increase the amount of work you have to do, and won\'t improve the accuracy
of your answer.  Fewer and you will get bad results as in the example above.

Other computations will have answers with different numbers of significant
figures.  However, for Traveller, we should never need more than about 4
significant figures in our answers; accuracy greater than this is probably
irrellevant to the game.  So keep the first 4 or 5 digits that your
calculator displays, and ignore the rest.  Going back to the above example
from FF&S, we can get by with SR = 69.304 * 1.17 * 1 = 81.086, which rounds
to 81m.  Note that this is slightly more punching on your calculator to
achieve the same results as when we kept only 3 digits, illustrating the
point I made earlier: more significant figures only adds work, and doesn\'t
increase the accuracy of your answer.

Check your math again.  MCr is an abbreviation for MegaCredits - millions of
credits.  MCr1 == Cr1,000,000; therefore MCr0.00050 == Cr500.  Expressed in
millions of credits, Cr0.5 is MCr0.0000005.

Hi, Rodge here:

I have some comments about the equipment breakdown rules in
T:TNE.

If a check for equipment failure must be made every 8 hours, then
the device can\'t have been constructed very well.  I can see how
the 8-hour rule would apply to equipment that has been sitting
around on a dead world for 80 years (due to general oxidization,
rust, and corrosion, etc.), but not for equipment from worlds
that have rebuilt their industrial base.

Put a good machine shop aboard a starship, and a skilled
technician could have the ship purring like a kitten in no time.
A dedicated mechanic wouldn\'t rest until the ship was in tip-top
condition.

I have minor repairs done to my truck only about twice per year,
and its over 20 years old!

Yes, T:TNE is worth the money.  The rule system is well done.
Though the campaign (New Era) is very sketchy.  Time will likely
solve the latter problem.

I couldn\'t stand it.  I don\'t have time to design jack.  I was
hoping there would be a collection of vehicles and equipment, but
we\'ll only have to wait until March (theoretically) for vehicles,
and until late \'94 for GDW\'s planned weapons sourcebook.

Traveller for the most part is modular.  T:TNE upgrades all of
the subsystems of the game rules, such as task resolution,
character generation, etc.  You can substitute just about any of
the rules subsystems in place of those used in CT or MT.  T:TNE
is quite compatible with the Traveller universe, and I use many
of the rules for my CT Spinward Marches campaign.

Unfortunately, if you want to run a campaign in New Era space,
you\'re virtually forced to start from scratch, unless you run a
Regency campaign.  Only a small region of space is presented in
T:TNE, and so your players\' characters could easily go off the
map unless you rigidly control their movements by giving them
orders through the RCES chain of command.

As for upcoming sourcebooks, this was GDW\'s production schedule
as reported in AAB Proceedings #22:

I talked to someone at GDW over the phone, and he said they\'re
running about 2 or 3 months behind.

Hope my answers and opinions help.

Hi, Rodge here:


I got a such a kick out of your comment:

 >And what the hell is Humphrey Bogart doing dressed up as a Star
 >Viking (p. 244)?

(It made me go into giggle fits for some reason) so I just had to
look it up.  Somehow, Traveller just doesn\'t evoke images of
Bogart, as I tried to visualize good ole\' Humphry in his stock
and trade overcoat and broad-rimmed hat, sporting a Machiavelli
ZZT laser cannon like it was a tommy gun and wearing a pair of
light intensification goggles, saying "Pal, this is the end of a
terrible relationship."  *ZZZZZZZZZT*

I don\'t think he looks all that much like Bogart, but thanks for
the laugh, I needed that.

In answer to your question, I\'d say he\'s looking up into the sky
at another ship that has just taken off, and that the reason for
his grim expression is that it\'s his ship, and it\'s left him
behind!

Though I think he looks more like Marlon Brando (especially when
you cover up his RCES head sheath with your left hand).

Are there any Traveller players on the TML from SEATTLE?

There are some openings in my Saturday Traveller campaign, and I
also hold an occasional Friday night gaming session.

I run a Classic Traveller campaign, heavily customized, set in
the Spinward Marches.  I\'m also preparing to run adventures in
The Far Frontiers, Foreven, and Deneb Sectors.

The meetings are held in North Seattle (Northgate area).

If you are interested, drop me a note.

wastewater treatment plant which TNE would consider "heavy equipment" and it
is very realistic for breakdowns of one form or another to occur at least
once
per day.  Many of these are easily repaired by our maintenance crew
(essentially the task roll to avoid an actual breakdown was successful).

  With regards to jump drives I rule that they function by generating
sufficient power to open the J-Space tunnel which the ship is then inserted
into to permit ftl travel.  Once the ship is in J-space the drive unit is no
longer running.  Under this system if the drive malfunctions the ship is
still
in N-space.  This may not be the "official interpretation" but it certainly
simplifies a potentially sticky problem.

I think you mean the *pressure* is immense on the surface of a gas giant,
rather than the gravity.  Though gas giants may bethousands of times more
massive than earth, they are typically also much larger.  Surface gravity
increases linearly with mass, but decreases with the square of the radius.
So, a planet 1000 times more massive and 20 times larger would have a
surface gravity only 2.5 times that of Earth.  This a high gravity
situation, but not beyond all help from technology.

Gravity becomes practically insignificant at such small scales.  The
square-cube law comes into play (gravitational force is proportional to the
cube of the length, while strength is proportional to the square).  For a
cell-sized structure the strength/weight ratio is about 1 000 000 times
greater than for a complete human body.

Where does the energy come from in this chain reaction?  I would expect
that only molecules with lower binding energies would be susceptible to
free radical damage, and hence less able to remove electrons from further
molecules.
Certainly free radicals damage biological molecules, but is it really a
chain reaction?

on, so if this is duplicating someone\'s previous post, I apologize.  I used
an Excel sheet to crunch this, and if anyone is interested, I can email to
James to have it uploaded.  I am almost finished with my small arms
spreadsheet.

El Armero Viejo (EAV - in Galangic, The Elderly Gunsmith) is a company
incorporated on Aubaine (Old Expanses 0738) a few years back that recently
completed some contract deals for the RCES.  Their weapons include a
replacement for the old snub pistol design, and a SMG using the same round,
and also a heavier variant of the popular LAG.  Recently, they have
branched out into support weapons, and this RAM AutoGL is a fine design to
expand their line.
It uses the standard 4cm RAM grenades, and their own 4cm grenade line is
shown at the bottom.

Grenade Launcher Design   (EAV Mdl-2 AutoRAM)
- --> For comparison, a 4cm TL8 Low Velocity AutoGL was also designed, and
where it differs, the values are shown in []. It uses the same munitions as
the shoulder-fired GL.

NOTE - this is usually mounted on a vehicle, and as such, has neglible
recoil in that mode. These recoil numbers are for when fired from the field
mount. If anyone is curious, removing the gyroscope reduces the weight by
0.5 kg, lowers cost by Cr300, and raises recoil numbers to 2/5.

I made the assumption that the receiver length mod for RAM was the same as
LV, since the muzzle velocity of the two was the same(and RAM wasn\'t on the
chart!).

EAV 4cm RAM (TL-10)
   HE    Damage - Contact 4, Burst Radius 15m (primary), Pen Nil, Cost Cr 48
  HEAP   Damage - Contact 3, Burst Radius 15m (primary), Pen 41C, Cost Cr 72
Each grenade weighs 0.48 kg.

Low Velocity 4cm grenades (for those without FF&S)
   HE    Damage - Contact 3, Burst Radius 15m (primary), Pen Nil, Cost Cr 2.4
  HEAP   Damage - Contact 2, Burst Radius 5m (primary), Pen 33C, Cost Cr 3.6
Each grenade weighs 0.24 kg


*** ERRATA NOTE ***
The grenade info on the back cover of the little pamphlet included in FF&S
shows 4cm RAM shoot-through grenades as weighing 0.24 kg.  I believe this
to be incorrect, and that the 0.24kg weight is for Low Velocity Propelled
Grenades, not RAM.  If someone can prove me wrong or show me where RAM
shoot-throughs get their weight divided by 2, please show me!!  This would
also throw off the cost, which would jump to the same costs as my grenades
above. Also, the HEAP-9 round should have a Pen = 41C, not 33C.

You just extend the handle forward to a more convenient location.  I\'ve used
on a number of occasions a bolt-action bullpup ( converted from an old .303
Mk IV Enfield for anyone who\'s interested ) which is a lovely gun to fire.

notes:

This is basically a TL14 craft, but I used a TL13 power plant for
maintenance reasons, since it was just as good for the purpose. The TL15
equivalent power plant is 13 m^3, 26t, and MCr2.6 so is definitely
worthwhile, unless used where maintenance of TL15 will be a problem.

The TL15 version of this craft costs approximately the same, but the
power plant, the computers and other electronics are smaller, so it has
an additional 15 m^3 or so of space available for cargo or other use
(fuel purification machinery for example). Also, at TL15 the control
points are sufficient that an electronics crewman is unnecessary.

This design is intended to be launch-bay interchangeable with the
standard ship\'s boat. (The standard ship\'s boat is considerably heavier,
due primarily to its TL12 power plant.)

It\'s fairly common to run this with two crew. It\'s also fairly common
for double occupancy staterooms, so up to six (including crew) can travel.

Higher jump capability actually works out to about the same overall
space, due to increased fuel efficency. for a jump/4 version the jump
drive becomes 21 m^3. Reducing the fuel capacity to 150 m^3 still allows
four parsecs of jump plus 24 gturns, plus we\'ve gained 12.6 m^3 of space.

Summary of TL15 version: jump/4, fuel scoops & purification, slight
increase in cargo space, increased flexibility in crewing.

Do you know of any others?

I need help in completing this table!

For those publications listed as "occasional", I need to know
which specific issues contained traveller material (I already
know the answer for Dragon magazine).

And if you haven\'t already guessed, I\'m after those issues which
I do not already have.  Perhaps we can work out some kind of
trade?  I have an extensive Traveller collection of about 450
published items to draw from.

            Any help you could provide would be appreciated.

Do you know of any others not listed above?

I need help on filling in the above chart!

I\'m also looking for information on the current status, publishers,
number of issues published, issue # of the last issue published, date
of publication, # of pages, etc.  Ordering addresses for active
fanzines would be a blessing.

And If you actually HAVE any of the above that I don\'t have, I\'d like
to talk to you -- perhaps we can work out some sort of trade, for
originals (or photocopies of out-of-print issues).  My Traveller
collection is extensive, containing about 450 printed products, mags,
and fanzines.

                      Looking high and low,

                      Roger Sanger


P.S.:  I will gladly post the charts again when they are more complete.

    'body' => 'After reading the article from b.borich I remembered a series of novels
by Anne McCafferty (which have nothing to do with Dragons) about psionic
interstellar transport.  One novel was called "The Rowan" and all
of them were quite good.

The psionic travel was accomplished by a stationary psion who used some
kind of energy turbine (mechanical!) to give her or him enough energy
to "hurl" vessels between stars.

I seem to recall that it was necessary for there to be a psion at the other
end of the journey to "catch" the vessel.  My subconcious may be making this
up, however, since I think it may be a good idea.  Of course if there is no
psion at the other end then the vessel has no way of returning!

I envision a small interstellar culture (ie pocket empire) who haven\'t
developed a "real" interstallar drive (due to lack of need), but occupy
several planets.  Should make a fun culture.  One way of introducing
such a culture would be for RCES scavengers to find a "driveless" ship
crashed on an abandoned planet-how did such a ship get there if it had
no jump drives?  Characters are sent to recover useful parts and investigate.

Other details from the book(s)
Psions powerful enough to throw ships were very very rare (say 20 in a
society of 10 billion).
Less powerful psions were employed as assistants to the more powerful ones
or as other kinds of specialists (including planetary teleportation)
Psionic interstellar travel took _time_ (weeks between planets)
Psions had an "allergy" to travelling that made such an event very traumatic
more so for more powerful psions (read the book if you want to know
why)


Someday I\'m going to have my own campaign and will stop giving away all
my best ideas...

Hi All,

I was just wondering....

Does anyone know if Poul Andersons Technic series is still in print?
I remember reading an old library copy as a teenager, but I\'ve never
seen it in stores.

I know that Trader to the Stars is not in print in the United States.
(I checked). For a long time I\'ve looked in used book stores, but
no luck yet.

So many people made reference to "The Forever War" that I went out
and bought it.  The valve-in-hip level of g-compensation seems a
little extreme for Traveller.  My hope was to find something that would
allow for some G-compensation at the tech level 9-11 range that wouldnot
too radically change the nature of space travel.  Having people
immersed in oxygenated flurocarbos doesn\'t seem too bad, but fitting
everyone with a valve does.
FF&S also makes reference to worksation G-tanks.  How much mobility
would someone in a G-tank have?  The Forever War indicates that even
in the lower-tech "clamshell" model they were essentially immobile, though
concious.  What would a workstation be like under these circumstances?
The U.S. Army Apache helicopter has a special helmet for the gunner
that uses small lasers or some such to sense the direction the gunner
is looking and automatically aims the guns in that direction.  Combined
with some armrest controls and a VR or HUD type environment, would
this be sufficient for performing normal ship functions while still
getting around the mobility problems in G-tanks?
Also, what about waldo-controlled robots for damage control
and the like.
What pressure do you need to compensate for each G and at
what pressure would you have to start worrying about gasses dissolving
in your blood and other pressure related problems.  How long would
it take to depressurize enought that you could safely leave the tank?
Basically, I\'m trying to get an idea of what these things might
be like in play.
Thanks in advance. :)

 Not necessarily.  The "archetypical" gas giant is in our own solar
 system, named Jupiter, and has an (estimated) surface G of 2.65.
 Larger gas giants would have higher surface Gs, but remember that
 gas giants are much less dense than your typical terrestrial
 planet, and surface G increases as the radius does; mass increases
 as the cube of the radius, assuming constant density.  Atmospheric
 pressure seems to be a different issue; we are talking about
 hundreds if not thousands of standard atmospheres.

 ... which, see above, is well above what a Jupiter-type planet
 will offer.  Saturn, if I recall, has a surface G of 1.17, and
 Uranus and Neptune are slightly lower than Saturn.  Again, we\'re
 looking at a pressure problem rather than a gravity problem.

 Which can certainly be a problem even in 2.64g, as the body is
 acclimated to 1g.  A person on Jupiter _could_ work, but only for
 short periods, and would have to spend a lot of time lying down,
 and get up or lie down _slowly_, to avoid fainting.

 Again, see above.  In 2,64g, this is probably not going to be too
 much of a problem, though extended exposure is clearly not
 recommended.

 The stuff on free radicals and fluorocarbons was interesting; I do
 want to note that I have seen (on TV, for what it\'s worth)
 information that seems to indicate that they have had small
 mammals survive quite nicely for "long" periods breathing
 fluorocarbons.  For game purposes, I wouldn\'t rule it out totally.
 It\'s plausible enough.

Re: Magazine FAO Roger Sanger,

White Dwarf is still around, but is now exclusively devoted
to Games Workshop material, namely Warhammer in all its guises.
You\'d have to go back at least 3-4 years to find any non-GW stuff.
(Come to think of it, who does publish Traveller in the UK? Answers
on a e-postcard please...)

There is (or was) an new(ish) independant magazine in the UK
called GM. It was of excellent quality, covering all aspects
of roleplaying, with articles on many systems, including Traveller.
I\'ve got #2-30 at home. I\'ll have a look.....

     The term "hurl" is a close description, what the psion does is use
     both telekinesis AND teleportation to throw the "cargo" toward their
     destination.  Most of the time it is only half way.  They get an
     energy boost by mentally tapping the \'field\' of the \'generators\' (the
     electromagnetic field energy is uniquely compatible with human
     bio-elctrical energy, thereby convertible by the psion into psionic
     energy)

     >I seem to recall that it was necessary for there to be a psion at the
     >other end of the journey to "catch" the vessel.

       the "hurled" ships and cargo pods being pushed as far as the first
     psion could push it, was then pulled by the catcher insystem.

       One minor point, the manned ships had some form of _insystem_ drive.
     those ships \'hurled\' past the range of nearest Psion had to use the
     insystem drive to get back in range in order to be \'picked up\' and
     returned to base.

     one other point is, in that world all children are tested to see what
     "talents" they posses and at what level. the combined results are given
     a number. This becomes their \'T rating\'.  The hurlers are T1\'s.  They
     posses at least 3 talents (telepathy,telekinesis, and teleportation)
     and a very high mental strength (even in traveller that combination is
     very very rare), and they go down from there to those with the barest
     "trainable" talents receiving a "T10" rating.

     My players have enjoyed their encounter with a culture like this (but
     that was MT date 185-1116).  They have yet to reestablish contact
     (Current MT/T:TNE date 010-1201)

Here\'s another NEW ERA point that\'s come to mind:

Exactly what distinguishes a class B starport from a class A?

Previously, the answer was obvious-- class A\'s could build jumpships
while class B\'s could only build non-jump ships.

What complicates things is the fuel limitations of HEPlaR ships.
Previously, with thruster plates or some unspecified "maneuver drive",
in-system travel times were in most cases short enough that most
in-system travel could be done with non-jump ships.  Sure, you needed
microjumps to get to the outer system quickly, but even there, if
time wasn\'t critical, multi-week journeys were only for the longest
of trips.

That\'s not the case now (and this "now" includes all 10,000 years of
star travel in Imperial space).  Under BL/FF&S, normal-space in-system
travel times are much, much longer.  The most timely way to get
around systems in almost every case will be to use microjumps.
It\'s not even feasable to send low-priority cargos by mass-driver
sling, because they\'re too vulnerable to theft:  A jump-capable ship
jumps in near the cargos\' trajectory somewhere deep in interplanetary
space.  Match vectors, take it aboard, and jump away!  The odds of
any ship being close enough to intercept in time is vanishingly
small, even provided the sling-route is patrolled at all.

So, what has been traditionally thought of as "in-system" ships
will actually be capable of microjumps (using a jump number of "0"
for building its drive). Ships that are not jump-capable will
at a practical level be limited to planetary interface roles and
subordinate craft to a mother(jump)ship.  Under the traditional way
of viewing starports, this means the bulk of ALL insystem craft
have to be made at class A starports.

This _REALLY_ doesn\'t sit well with me.

Here\'s a modified starport classification that seems reasonable to me:

A:  Capable of building starships with 1+parsec-jump drives.

B:  Capable of building ships with microjump-only drives.  There
    is some (unspecified) engineering hurdle that class A ports are
    equipped to deal with but class B\'s are not.  THIS HURDLE IS
    _INDEPENDENT_ OF TECH LEVEL.  Note that this works well with
    class B ports\' ability to do the annual maintainence on starships.

C:  Given the greatly reduced utility of normal-space-only ships,
    I think class C\'s of sufficient tech level should be able to
    build non-jump ships.  This also works well with class Cs\'
    ability to do the annual maintainence on "non-starships".

Like I said, it seems reasonable to me.  Your milage may vary.

 You misunderstood what you were told. We don\'t have any in
 regular stock, because we don\'t have enough to offer through
 normal distribution channels (distributors are not interested in
 carrying things they cannot get in large quantities). However, we
 do make some items available via mail order, but quantities vary
 almost daily, and we cannot guarantee the availability of any

This is not Frank\'s intention. Any number of configuration
descriptions can apply to the same weapon (you multiply them all
together for a final Cm value). Clearly, there are some
combinations which are mutually exclusive, such as two-handed and
one handed. There are others that are not likely, but we leave
that up to the individual to determine. BTW, I believe both bolt
action and bullpup shotguns have been created, although they are
not very common. There is even a lever action shotgun, as
observant viewers of the film _Terminator 2_ will be aware. I am
unaware of a bolt action bullpup weapon, but I see no reason why
one could not be made.
           A GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT
If anyone wants any designs posted here to be considered
for inclusion in the RCEG, you must specifically inform me so by
Email. Anything that\'s gonna go in has to be in my hands (or the
electronic equivalent thereof) by 1 March (preferably before).

I seem to remember that part of the Azhanti High Lightning supplement was an
adventure set in the atmosphere of a gas giant.  A High Lightning class ship
was ambushed while refueling and was now disabled and floating at the point
in the atmosphere where it was boyant.  The adventure part was to get down to
a deck where a special cargo was stored and then make it back up to the
gooseneck for retrieval. The enemy was these blob like creatures that had
entered through breaches in the hull. It was a simple intro to the system.

As for the questions about starports. As far as I understand the
classification system is still the same as with CT/MT.  In the Unity of
Suffren module in with the referees screen, they make an exception of
Suffren\'s Class A port. Stating that it has repair capability only.

As far as a short jump to make insystem travel quicker, GDW changed the
M-drive mechanics in order to make the game more realistic. I agree with that
viewpoint.  But then using 2300 style stutter warp drives would solve that
problem.

Just my 2c.

Anyone care to speculate on how the Virus would interact with Artifacts

Was the Ancient site at Shelagyote (1620 Diaspora) ever formally described?

Has anyone else noticed that Ililek Kullgaan and the Hivers a.k.a. the
Imperial History Club of Manchus were BOTH at Vaward/Old Expanses on
122-1127?  This is the most suggestive evidence that the Hivers were
already laying the foundation for recovery from a second long night.
Notice that the only frontiers listed on the TNE map are in the Old
Expanses.  This is the same sector where the I. H. C. of M. was

  For those interested in my opinion TNE is a much
improved Traveller and while I may not have a gaming
group to actually run the game it is a very welcome
addition to my gaming library.  Not only is the
character generation and task resolution improved but
I believe the spacecraft maintenance and combat rules
have the right amount of detail for a sci-fi rpg.
  I am somewhat disappointed that the melee weapons
are still left in the dark ages (the highest Tech

collapsible batons, plastic knives (from the
MegaTraveller computer game), and even vibro knives
and laser swords a la "Space Opera".  After all even
the Millenium Falcon made it to page 81 of the

The psionic energy created by the convertor would then need to be
controlled and processed by several psions, all of whom would have to
have the teleportation skill at an advanced level. The psions would also
need to be very familiar with each other since they would have to be able

trained and developed their psionic skills together also.

I think you misunderstand my point.  I\'m not griping about the change
in maneuver drive mechanics, I\'m trying to square a major problem
that emerges from the change at the system strategic level.

To illustrate the point: under CT/MT, a Dragon-class SDB could
be reassigned from Earth to Neptune, and take up station within
a week.  Under BL rules, even if it burned every last gram of fuel
accelerating and decelerating, it would take the same ship about
2.5 MONTHS to make the same transit.

Merchants need to move ships to generate revenues in excess of
their expenses.  The Military needs to be able to redeploy ships
quickly.  To move things around in a timely fashion, especially
outside of orbit #4, in-system ships NEED to be able to microjump.

Under the "standard" starport classification, most merchant ships
that operate in the outer system, as well as virtually ALL
military boats and monitors will have to be made at class A starports.
Not just in the New Era, but during the Rebellion, the Frontier Wars,
the Interstallar wars, at the dawn of Vilani star travel, during ALL
of the history of Charted Space.

That means most of the sorts of ships that class B ports built now
have to be handled by A-class ports.  Like I said, that doesn\'t sit
well with me.  My solution was to redefine the capabilities of
starports slightly to shift the relations between ports and
in-system craft back to what it used to be:

Class A\'s build _starships_ (ships with a jump number if 1+)
Class B\'s Buils _non-starships_ (ships with a jump number of 0)
and slightly different but it seems to be a natural progression:
Class C\'s can build non-_jump_ ships

in all cases provided the technical base exists.

Just arrived in the mail from J. Andrew Keith:

the manuscripts for the unpublished

LETTER OF MARQUE
A PILOT"S GUIDE TO THE CALEDON SUBSECTOR

Both are huge, and will take several issues to print. They are both set
within the Reaver\'s Deep sector. Not sure which issue we will start
printing these in, but just thought I\'d pass on the good news :)


TTC #4 & 5
Work on TTC #4 is going well, and should be at the printers next
week....look for it in your mailbox (or your local gaming store) the
first week of April. Be prepared for a new look - TTC #4 will have a full
color cover! The price will increase to $3.75 per issue (subscription
prices will remain the same).TTC #4 will contain a couple of adventures
dealing with the Vargr...I will post the table of contents shortly.

TTC #5 will introduce an excellent new minor race; the Mermani, from
the keyboard of fellow TMLer Bill White.

I was overjoyed to read Paul Sanders\' announcement that
Sword of the Knight Publications has aquired the manuscripts
for the never before published adventure Letter of Marque and
the cancelled Gamelords supplement Pilot\'s Guide to the Caledron
Subsector.

It looks like they plan to run each of them as a series of articles
in the fanzine The Traveller Chronicle.

I was wondering what everyone\'s opinion was on the form of presentation
they would prefer most:

Would you rather read them as a series in a magazine, or would you
rather purchase them as complete stand-alone products?


Just curious,
Roger Sanger

We had some discussion on this topic on TNE-Pocket.  Without going into
too much detail, we figured that the tech 25-35+ Ancients\' sites would
_almost_ always defeat the TL-16 Virus.

HOWEVER, the times where it DIDN\'T defeat it would prove VERY interesting.

Design what ever you want for the adventure, just make sure it isn\'t either
too powerful for your players or isn\'r
able to get into their hands

Subject: Traveller 90210

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE:
- ----

Recently I agreed to run a filler campaign to help out a friend whose own
campaign had to be put on hold for a while. The group decided to try some
SF.

So I chose Traveller 2300, at least \'officially\'. There might be a
Traveller crossover later on - just to fool the guy who knows all about
Kafers. Maybe they\'ll meet the First Imperium!

The players then decided during character generation that they were going
to base their characters on personalities in the series Beverly Hills
90210, which I have never seen. They are playing Brandon, Andrea, and
Dillon.

If any TMLer is familiar with the series and has any suggestions for
adapting the characters to 2300 I\'d be most grateful. Also, deep dark
secrets from the characters in the series past, a synopsis or two of a plot
they\'ve been involved in in the series, who their friends and enemies are,
etc would be helpful. The characters will be starting on the island of
Madagascar off the coast of Africa.

Meanwhile, I may have to watch an episode or two, just for background.

Any help appreciated.

Thanks,
Alistair.

I have cut and pasted over four pages of such items
from the MegaTraveller rules.  The following data is
from Traveller Book 3, Worlds and Adventures:

FOOD AND OVERHEAD

  The following are indications of the prices for food
and basic survival:

   Basic Cuisine on a Daily Basis: Food is available
in a variety of forms and qualities.  Prices indicated
are per person.
  Restaurant meals of ordinary quality cost Cr10 per
day.  Excellent qualtiymeals range in price from Cr20
to Cr50 per person.  Travellers" Aid Society
facilities provide excellent quality meals to members
and guests for Cr20.
  Food purchased from vendors for preparation at home
costs about Cr5 per day and weighs about 1 kg.
  Preserved foods for rations on expeditions may be
canned or packaged (Cr20 per day, weighs 0.5 kg) or
dehydrated (Cr25 per day, weighs 0.2 kg, dependent on
locally supplied water).

  Subsistence on a Long Term Basis:  In situations
where time passes quickly, personal survival or
subsistence costs can be assumed to be the values
given below:
  Starvation Level - bare minimum of food, Cr60 per
month.  Dismal lodging, Cr60 per month.
  Subsistence Level - reasonable food, Cr120 per
month.  Acceptable lodging, Cr180 per month.
  Ordinary Level - good food, Cr200 per month.  Good
lodging, Cr200 per month.
  High Living - excellent food, Cr600 per month.
Excellent lodging, Cr300 per month.

  Ship Crews - Individuals living on ship-board have
ordinary lodging and food taken care of, but generally
spend much of their salary for expenses and other
costs.

In partial answer to my previous grubling about the
lack of high tech melee weapons here are the stats for
the plastic knife from the MegaTraveller 1 computer
game extrapolated by me to TNE standards:

Plastic Knife: This knife is similar to a regular
dagger, but constructed of a dense hydrocarbon
plastic.  After the weapon has been melted or
misshaped, it can return to its normal shape by
tapping it sharply against a firm base.  This plastic
weapon cannot be discovered at starport weapon
detection areas.

9   0.2 liters 0.1 kg  Cr300  S       +2        1D6


- ----
I also have found some more suspicious items in the
T:TNE rules.  In the Autoguns weapon listings for the
VRF Gauss guns I have the following stats which seem
to be slightly transposed:

                        ----Weight----
Caliber              Empty    Loaded Ammo  Magazine
- ----
VRF Gauss gun (veh)   26.68   41.68  15    30000C/2

VRF Gauss gun (veh)  4213     0.01/320
VRF Gauss gun (mp)   5103     0.01/915


Somehow it just seems counter-intuitive that the
vehicular weapon weighs less.  It seems that most of
the above numbers for the veh model with the exception
of ammo wt. and magazine cap. should be switched with
the mp model and vice-versa.

Another item: what is the mass of a sand cannister and
what is its volume?  I assume the improvement in beam
reduction by sand casters is a result of the electro-
magnetic field generated and not because of different
types of sand.

I agree with the problem John identified, but in order to avoid changing
the way that starport B\'s and C\'s have always been, why not just have the
companies on starport A worlds export jump drives to the companies of
starport B worlds.  The starport B takes care of the rest (as they have
always been able to do).

In a small way, it adds to adventure possibilities (pirates want to hijack
a shipload to repair damaged ships, lower-tech rivals like the Zhodani
or even TEDs want to steal higher tech Imperial or Regency or Hiver
drives, some merchant captain disappears with them and the party are hired
to get them back, or whatever).

This also avoids having to come up with all the stats for a jump-0 drive
(unless it is in Brilliant Lances, which I don\'t have).  Have GDW ever
shown support for micro jumps, incidentally?  I know it is "official"
(DGP, wasn\'t it?) but I can\'t remember ever seeing GDW using them.  If not
in Brilliant Lances, maybe Loren could give a ruling.

Somebody asked about cash base value for Average Stellar TL.
In Traveller Players\' Forms it is handled like Advanced Stellar i.e.
Cr5000. In fact as a mean GM I used Cr1000 base value before I got TPF.

Thank\'s to those who answered to my Starship malfunction problem but I
would like to know how the jump drive works officially. Whether it uses
constant output to stay in jump space or does it just open a window to the
jump space and then shuts?

I have thought that it have to pay somekind of a tax or membership fee to the
RC or to the world which have made the contact. It must probably give up
it\'s rights to the relic technology.

In return the new "colony" world\'s population would receive education.
It is also possible that the planet would have regulated rights to it\'s
relic technology or imported technology to rise it\'s TL.

Maybe the planet would be at first a client state to the planet which made
contact (conquered it). After certain period of time it would be granted
full membership of the RC.

I\'d like to know if anybodys Star Viking campaign has reached this point
and if so, what happened. My players have played only The Once and Future
Emperor.

Could somebody also tell me what kind of status is Client State.

If there is somebody who wants scenario ideas, here is some.
- - Tosaga corporation from Aubaine is planning to scavenge Seliga and hires
  PCs to help and transport their Tosaga\'s agent. Tosaga doesn\'t have a
  starship of it\'s own at the moment.

  Schall is also interested in Seliga and has hired a scavenger team to loot.
  When these two teams meet there is high possibility of conflict.

- - Before collapse there used to be a Naval base in Keipes. There is even
  now B class starport so I believe that the Naval base have survived at least
  partly. That\'s good news. The bad news is that it still have nukes.
  Maybe local party or some terrorist or criminal group is investigating
  the site and finds those nukes and starts to blackmail. PC\'s job is of
  course to disable those nukes and neutralise the bad asses.

I haven\'t used neither of these ideas yet, but thet Seliga thing is next on
the list. If you use these ideas I\'d like to know what happened and how you
modified them.

My only problem with this change (and it is a DRASTIC change when your
players move about a system) is how to explain the transmogrification of the
starship to the players when they finally thaw from their 60+ year sleep.
Telling them it takes weeks to travel a distance a distance it only took days
to travel in the old system does not contribute to campaign realism and
consistency (not to mention the disappearance of the triple-beams).
Of course, according to Mr Nilsen\'s rant from january, were should all just
throw pixie dust out the back of our ships.

Mr John H. Bogan states:
>To illustrate the point: under CT/MT, a Dragon-class SDB could
>be reassigned from Earth to Neptune, and take up station within
>a week.  Under BL rules, even if it burned every last gram of fuel
>accelerating and decelerating, it would take the same ship about
>2.5 MONTHS to make the same transit.

This severly undercuts the usefulness of SDBs and other non-jump
capable ships.  Even with microjumps, the micro-jdrive and fuel (for at least
two microjumps) cuts into their efficiency.

>Merchants need to move ships to generate revenues in excess of
>their expenses.  The Military needs to be able to redeploy ships
>quickly.  To move things around in a timely fashion, especially
>outside of orbit #4, in-system ships NEED to be able to microjump.

Since the microjump takes you out of the picture for a week, the
situation will certianly change by the time you get there.  There will be no
n-space chases, piracy will be curtailed, and the planets in a system will be
more isolated from each other than from neighboring systems.
What this also does is almost completely eliminate the strategic
usefulness of gas giants for military operations.  No longer will a system have
to scatter its now-crippled SDBs amongst the system covering gas giants, they
can orbit a primary planet shoulder to shoulder and wait for the enemy to come
to them.  But, when the enemy gets there, they\'ll be short on fuel.
This really cuts down on planetary invasions (difficult already) while
changing the strategic movements of a fleet.  Why show a system has a gas giant
when its going to take you a month out of the way?

Why not? Since the physics of the universe has change for TNE, why not
the history of it as well?  This time, GDW has shown that it doesnt care about
the established history of Traveller, much less my TL13 \'just add water\'
mercenary unit. (Fusion gun *ammo*? Geeeze..)
(Personally, I often wonder how Mr Nilsen can stand to berate
reactionless drives as being unrealistic while giving us the \'fudge factor\' of
gravitic focusing then telling us to \'get over it\'.)  Realism? Ha.)

Have you noticed the cost increase of an SDB if microjump drives are
added?  Less SDBs per system, but no problem, sice all you have to
patrol/defend now is the primary. Given the drastic changes in the universe of
the New Error, your change seems to be the easiest and most sensible change.
As for me, our gaming group is keeping the MT ship rules, heavilly modified to
use weaponry as designed in Striker.  We\'ll probably change the weapon design to
FF&S, but with different damage/pen ratings (weve already changed the slug
throwers).  As a quick change to keep the \'feel\' of the game similar, I\'ve
contimplated dividing the fuel use of HEPLAR by 10, therefore multiplying the
g-turns of a ship by 10.  This gives the SDB boat from BL (112*10=)1120 g-turns,
or (1128/48=) 23 days of thrust.
(Interestingly, this also changes the g-turns of the sub merchant to
600 turns, or 12.5 days, the far trader 10 days, and the free trader 11.7 days,
all close to the 2 week duration I used to design into my MT merchants.)
If I can convince myself of this change, *then* I\'ll get rid of reactionless
drives. Of course, IMHO, TNE would have been a better game if it hadn\'t been
called Traveller.  (Does that mean I\'m stuck in my ways?:))

                   A Traveller\'s Wish List
   (of products and game aids that do not currently exist):
 
AN INDEX SPANNING ALL TRAVELLER MATERIAL WRITTEN, seperated into
categories (such as starships, equipment, astrography, character
generation, NPC\'s, news items, etc.).  You could then see at a
glance just what has been developed for the game (what, where,
who).  Picking and choosing equipment would become easier, rather
than the current method of searching through book after book and
mag after mag.  The main benefit though would be that you could
more easily find everything ever written about a particular
world.
 
ALL TRAVELLER MATERIAL ON A CD.  Linked via hypertext with
several menu interfaces, tables of contents, and indices to allow
easy access.
 
ILLUSTRATIONS AND DECKPLANS OF ALL STARSHIPS for which there are
stats. Running an adventure with a ship you can\'t show to the
players has always been rather infeasible for me to do.
 
ADVENTURES WITH SUPPORT MATERIAL (MAPS, ILLUSTRATIONS, etc.) as
extensive as the James Bond adventure series.  To save the ref
the time needed to make floorplans, city and regional maps,
starport layouts, etc.
 
A COMPREHENSIVE EQUIPMENT CATALOG.  Including items from every
tech-level, and including a major section on robot models and
another on cybernetic enhancements.  Leave the "how-to design"
rules in FF&S.
 
A COMPREHENSIVE ASTRONOMICAL ATLAS, with writeups on all worlds
included in the game.  Something similar to the planet write-ups
included in the Flaming Eye Campaign Sourcebook.  Or at least
covering an area large enough that players aren\'t like to wander
off the edge of the map (and into undeveloped territory) anytime
soon.
 
A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF EVERY TRAVELLER ARTICLE EVER WRITTEN.  I\'ve
always wondered just how much has been written for this game.
 
A PHOTO ALBUM INCLUDING ALL ART EVER CREATED FOR TRAVELLER.
Indexed by what is included in each picture (see "index" entry
above).
 
          Any comments?

   To get a DV of 6 with dart ammo requires a muzzle energy of 8100 J.
Required energy at TL 10 is 3 times that, so for 500 rounds you need a
magazine battery of 122 kg (8100*3*500*0.00001).  For 30000 rds, you\'d need a
mag bat of 73 _tonnes_.

   The mp (man-portable) version includes the mass of the battery powering
the weapon.  The vehicle one is assumed to be plugged into the vehicle\'s
power system or other separate power supply.  Unfortunately, there is no
mention of what power input is needed.  At its maximum rate of fire (5 bursts
of 50 shots per 5 seconds) the gun should require 1.215 MW (8100*3*5*50/5).
A 2-tonne TL 10 storage battery would power it for 120 000 rds at full ROF.

   Sand canisters mass 0.5 tonnes in a volume of 0.5 kL.  The improvement is
from both reasons.  Higher tech levels use gravitic as well as/instead of
magnetic fields, which allows the use of more effective sand.

Someone was wondering if GDW has ever officially sanctioned "microjumps", or
at least Jump-0.  In the first case, at least, the answer is yes.  In the
Solomani Aliens module the Jump drive was originally used to cut down on
travel time between the outer system planets.  Of course, this was probably
just a Jump-1 Drive jumping insystem and never stated to be a "jump-0" drive.
(I\'m assuming that a J-0 drive would not have a one parsec range -- Since
a J-1 Drive is possible at TL9, it seems that if range was an issue it was
probably one of power production and not Jump drive efficiency...)

Just my Cr0.02...

	My own solution concerning maneuver drives was to make HEPlaR 
technology dependent on the society\'s TL, in the same way that other 
jump and maneuver drives are based on TL. By the time the society was TL 
15 or 16, the efficiency of their HEPlaR drives would enable them to achieve 
the travel times mentioned in MT rules and TML letters. And concerning 
gravitic technology, lasers, and the "fudge factor" S_DMOODY mentions, I 
think that GT is a reasonable way to make lasers more effective without

Yep, I know of at least one occassion in which GDW made good use of
the microjump method of insystem travel. It was in their campaign
"KnightFall" for Megatraveller. At the start of the campaign there
was a detailed account of how a deep penentration invasion force
used a microjump to travel from there jump entry point (well outside
the planets scanning range to the primary planet. This bypassed all
insystem defenses and gave no warning of the imminent attack by the
fleet. It was a crucial element in the adventure, so who knows
maybe it was just used as a convient plot device. It\'s been a while
since I\'ve looked over my MegaTraveller books, so i\'ve no idea whether
they previously covered this.

How about adjusting the system generation a bit.  Move the companion star
into the habitable orbit with your main world.  Place the world in a 
trojan orbit 60 degrees ahead or behind the companion star.  If the 
companion star is M class it should have little effect on the temperature
but the tides will be impressive.  

The companion star could have a few worlds orbiting it mostly similar to 
moons around a gas giant.  If you wanted to justify the amber rating you 
could have asteroids locked into the trojan points as well making 
navigation to your main world hazardous.

If you did this you could have a thriving industry on the main world as 
they sent out pilots to direct incoming and outgoing ships through the 
asteroids.

 I had the same question, and asked Loren about this
(via GEnie) several weeks ago.  The numbers _are_ correct,
as the "man-luggable" version needs batteries (HEAVY
batteries) to fire all those rounds.  The vehicle-mounted
weapon draws power from the vehicle, and thus doesn\'t need
batteries.  The "Man-Portable" VRF Gauss Gun is really the
high-tech equivalent of an emplaced machine-gun, and is not
man-portable in the same sense that the PGMP and FGMP are.

 These are in FF&S, page 58 ("Defensive Systems"). A
cannister masses 0.5 tonnes and displaces 0.5 m3. The
improving performance is due to increased control at first,
but the switch to gravitically controlled sand allows
nonmagnetic (and more efficient) sand to be used.

obviously very aproximate too.
  But I\'m interested in it as indicator of what is resonable and what is
not.

  So, do anyone know the proper time periods for the various hierarchical

Alex Holt asked:
 
 >1) Which one of the Traveller rules sets is the best in terms of
 >playability?
 
I\'d say it\'s a mixed bag.  I use subsystems from each of the eras
of Traveller.  The task resolution system of TNE seems the
easiest to use for me, though I employ a more gradiated
difficulty scale than they do, modifying their chart by adding
intermediary levels of difficulty (a modifier at each interval of
1/8th).
 
The character generation systems of each of the games are too
cumbersome and time consuming for me, plus players tend to wind
up with characters they aren\'t happy with, so I use the following
2 methods:
 
Method 1:  I determine what careers, skills, skill-levels, and
equipment would be unacceptable for the scenario/setting to be
played in, and make these off-limits.  Then I let each player
choose his character\'s career and the number of terms he\'s been
in it (sometimes I put a cap on terms).  Stats are rolled
normally on 2d6, ignoring entrance requirments.  Then each player
rolls a 6-sider to determine the number of skills he gets per
term, then he spends his skill points on whatever skills he wants
from the the skill charts for his class in the MegaTraveller
Player\'s Manual, except for chart 4 unless or until he has the
requisite education level.  Mustering out is done normally.  I
find that this system cuts out a lot of dice rolling.
 
Method 2:  Takes more prep-work on the ref\'s part, but once the
prep-work is done, this saves precious game session time, and
gets the players into play much faster.  The ref simply generates
a bunch of characters in advance (the more the better), and lets
his players choose which ones they want to be.  Variations on
this theme I\'ve used successfully are giving discretionary skill
points for the players to spend to customize their characters a
bit, or a limited number of edits for the same purpose.  I keep
the changes allowed down to minimum (say 2d6 points worth) to
reduce time spent in character generation.
 
The experience system in TNE is a good concept, but much too
generous.  I basically use the same system, but grant smaller
rewards.
 
As for combat, I often just wing it.  The players don\'t know the
difference, as my nose is always in the book.  I like the TNE
combat system best.  In my game, I use the task-resolution system
with several modifications.  As for ship damage, I note the
game\'s rules as guidelines, but above all try to keep it
cinematic.
 
2) Do people enjoy playing in space (ie from world to world) vs.  on a
single world?
 
In my experience, both.  It all has to do with how good your
background material is.
 
For instance, Glisten/Glisten/Spinward Marches was written up in
one of the Traveller\'s Digests.  It makes for a very rich
campaign setting:  A high-tech high-population civilization
living in an asteroid system, with lots of in-system traffic.
One of my campaign branches deals with a pair of Scout
Intelligence Operatives posing as employees of a company based
there, for the purposes of finding and tracking enemy spies.
There\'s been so much activity there, that they\'ve had no need to
leave the system.
 
On the other hand, travelling around is handled well in The
Traveller Adventure, with encounters and mini-scenarios along the
way.
 
Hope that helps,
 
Roger Sanger.

Roger Sanger reported a problem with the main world being one orbit inside
of a companion star.

Assuming you\'re using T:TNE rules, check out page 192 at the bottom right
corner, step 12.  Certain orbits are prohibited from being occupied
by planets depending on the orbit of the star.

I fyou are not using TNE, stable orbits are available within roughly 1/3
of the separation between the two stars, and outside of 3 times their 
separation.

Also note that the "companion" star doesn\'t really orbit the primary star,
the two stars orbit around a common center of mass.  Putting the 
companion in one of the primary\'s orbits is just a simplified way of noting
the separation between the two.

Planets in the orbit numbers greater than the companion star actually orbit
the center of mass of the two stars.  Again, noting their position as
the "primary\'s" orbit numbers is just a way of keeping the record-keeping
simple.

My advice:  Move the star further out or closer in, so that it doen\'t 
interfere with the orbit of the main world.

I\'ve ranted about this before, but here\'s some constructive help
I\'ve rationalized from my Campaign:

HOW TO EXPLAIN MAJOR CHANGED IN TRAVELLER TO YOUR FRESHLY THAWED PCs

In my campaign, they had to have the Hivers of Spica (the Six Hexed
Nest) do a major refit of their Azhanti High Lightning Class Ship.

They did the following:

Replaced the (now useless) Particle Accellerator Bays with more
splufty Laser Bays for political reasons (they couldn\'t repair PAs).

Replaced all the "worn out" turrets with new ones: they replaced
triple turrets with Barbettes.

Replaced the Mysterio Drives (whatever powered CT M-Drives) with less
efficient (but less potentially dangerous) HEPlaR Thrusters.  Y\'See,
at the OLD velocities, the E-VIL Virus could pulp everyone in the 
ship... and, um, these drives don\'t need as much computer control...
see?

If you do a direct conversion of CT ships to TNE ships, they have
about 50 g-turns of fuel WITH THE SAME FUEL CAPACITY AS THE CT SHIPS
because of the way PP and JD fuel consumption has changed.

They are slower though.  Don\'t have any scientists in my group,
though (whew!)

"Ship go real fast ZOOOOM!!"

"How far away is the other ship?"

"6,000 kilometers. No WAIT, _60_000 kilometers..." says I.

Vanya say:

One of the cool things about TNE (and I don\'t know if this was true of
MT) is that there\'s all sorts of economical ways to defend a system.
Lots of teeny-tiny mines hooked into a sensor grid patiently waiting
to blow up anything that doesn\'t meet a well defined list of
parameters...  but I think this issue has been pretty well covered.

Your point though, that the STRUCTURE of space defence has changed, is

You can STILL do a "Just Add Water" unit, you just have to shift
gears from Fusion to Lasers.  The end result (enemy go BOOM!) is 
still the same, and you still don\'t have to worry about making ammo.

I\'ve completed a Tank design along these lines, I just need to pretty
it up for ASCII transport...

  I was looking through the list of upcoming products that Loren was
nice enough post.  There was no mention of a FF&S follow.  On page 4 of
FF&S, it\'s noted that it didn\'t cover as many subjects as they liked.  Some
of the topics listed as up for future work are: "wet" ships, robots,
primitive transport, and genetic engineering.
 
  The "wet" ship design is the biggest hole, IMHO.  What is the
offical word on addressing these topics?  Is GDW still planning on
releasing a"FF&S II"?  It would be nice to drop us some tidbits before
hand.  Challange Mag is a good forum for this.  Wet ship design could be
published in a one or two peice article.  Followed perhaps by basic robot
design.

When last we left our heroes, Mark Urbin had commented about the lack
of Wet Navy ships in FF&S.  Although I agree that the "generic" vehicle
design sequence is sort of crippled by the lack of a major class of
craft, I personally missed Robot rules more (especially considering they
decided to include Bionics).

Really, the whole lack of Robots is connected to a sort of major hole in
the Imperium-as-published:  Major cultural elements which are described
as such are provided with insufficient coverage.  Robots are one
example, Aliens are another.  Consider the lowly Bwap.  Although this
minor race has been spacefaring since the First Imperium and enjoys a
wide dispersion throughout the Third (having been described as common
merchants) I had never heard of them until I stumbled across a copy of
The Best of the JoTAS...Robots, more or less described as Ubiquitous at
TL of 13 and up (at least), have also only put in minor appearances.

<Grump, grump>

Granted that these quibbles are less applicable to a TNE campaign where
robotics and automation may play a lesser role, they remain issues in
the Regency...

I currently own copies of the TNE rules and FF&S, I was put off buying BL
by the combat system in the roleplaying game. I resoned that if they were
capable of putting such a roleplaying-hostile set of rules in the RPG, the
board game version would be even less playable in a roleplaying context.

I don\'t want to denigrate the excellent work that has gone into the TNE
background an rules, but there do seem to be a few anomalies which I would
like to see cleared up. The principal problem is with HEPLAR propulsion.

HEPLAR drives are not a recent idea, Larry Niven\'s stories have
included a similar system for a long time, the basic idea is just to put
a hole in a fusion reactor and bigo - instant fusion drive. (Simplified,
but that\'s the theory). Another axiom from Niven\'s Known Space series is
that the efficiency of a propulsion system is directly proportional to it\'s
efficiency as a weapon. If you work out the exhaust velocity of a HEPLAR
thrust jet, it approximates to one quarter of the speed of light! There are
two problems with this: a) I very much doubt that a fusion drive is capable
of generating exhaust velocities even approaching this. b) If I were
responsible for planetary space traffic controll, I would not allow a HEPLAR
drive inside the orbit of the moon, let alone land on the planet\'s surface.
Even worse, Some of the example planetary vehicles use HEPLAR propulsion!
Anyone care to calculate the weapon statistics for a typical HEPLAR drive?

There is a way round this : use a denser fluid as the exhaust gas. The most
suitable medium is probably water. By mixing the exhaust hydrogen with an
inert medium you actualy increse the efficiency of the drive. A lot of the
energy in a pure hydrogen exhaust would be lost as thermal radiation and
gamma rays, contributing no thrust. These would be absorbed by a dense
exhaust agent and so increase efficiency. Also, water is denser than hydrogen,
so the volume of reaction mass would be reduced.

Hi folks,
	I have a couple of problems regarding a few things in FF&S (hats off to
all involved in its making - darn good product, crawl, crawl, bootlick, etc.).
	First off, does anyone know what Maintenance Points are, and how they 
are used? I can\'t seem to find any reference in the TNE main rules (or the FF&S
ones, for that matter) about them, other than whats stated in the ship design
round-up bit.
	Is it me, or do you actually get two different values (through two
different calculations) when determining Maintenance Points. One calculation
is the aforementioned one that is one of the final steps in the ship design 
sequence at the start of FF&S, which adds up the total mass of the ship minus
that of its hull shell, then divides it by various numbers. The other 
calculation is in the crew calculation step, when you\'re finding how many 
Maintenance Crew you\'ll need on the ship (i assume these are Technicians, as 
opposed to Engineers). I seem to get different numbers for each of these 
calculations, so which one do I use, and which one is stated whenever I see
a complete ship description (where it says \'Maint: 123\' (or whatever). HELP!!

	One other thing - what exactly are Stewards, and why do you need them
on non-passenger ships? I can guess that on a military ship, they function as 
Quartermasters for the Ships Troops, and they serve an obvious function on a 
passenger ship, but what are their duties on say, a Scout Ship?
	BTW, I\'ve got lots of new rules (of my own devising) concerning Gravitic
Technology, which might be useful regarding this little kerfuffle that seems 
to be going on about microjumps. If anyone\'s interested, then do email, or say
so on any replies to my queries on the net!
	That\'s all for now, I\'d really appreciate any help on these questions.

I have a few questions about 2300 and Star Cruiser that I decided to post
to the TML and also directly to the members of the 2300 list.  I would like
to receive some feedback from these on what format they would like the
list to work.  I also got a few "undelivered message" so if you\'re reading
this on TML but not through direct mail let me know.

# To Dean Gilbert: I read your request for 2300 info on the TML and decided
to include you in this list.  Let me know if you prefer to be removed.

# To the TML administrator:  I\'ve been contacting people in the computer
center to create a ftp site for 2300 here in Lisbon.  But in this place
everything happens very slowly.  What do you think of creating a 2300AD
directory in the TML site (maybe there is one already, I haven\'t been there
for some time)?

Now for the real stuff:
    I tried out a few star cruiser scenarios and found out that a ship
with average crew quality has no chance of repairing any damage but power
plant damage.  How do you handle this?
    On the same game, is there a errata for it?  The ship design book is
loaded with mistakes and omissions (for example there was something about
determining weight or area of a weapon\'s fixture that was contradictory between
the rules and the examples but I don\'t remember the details).

    About 2300 does anyone have any information from "Invasion" in computer
form (an on-line version from GDW would be really nice).  I discovered that
it is out of print and I haven\'t been able to find a copy anywhere.

    I have been designing a few vehicles for the game and came up against
something apparently inconsistent: the price of the Swift Songbird utility
hover seems a little too high.  It costs Lv20 000 which is more expensive
than a limousine (Lv15 000) and terribly more expensive than another hover
from Matsu, the Snow Demon costing Lv4000.  The later is smaller and slower
but is a difference of 5 times acceptable?  (even a large wheeled transport
is cheaper than the songbird)

Sticking to the GDW definition of Plasma Physics,  You\'re absolutely
correct on both points!

> Even worse, Some of the example planetary vehicles use HEPLAR propulsion!
> Anyone care to calculate the weapon statistics for a typical HEPLAR drive?

When within a planetary atmosphere it should behave like a
plasma/fusion weapon of similar output.  However, it should also be as
harmless as a fusion gun in space.  All the charged ions from the
plasma will repell each other once outside of the confines of the
power plant\'s magnetic containment field, thus instanting dissapating
the exhaust.

The amount of additional thrust from this would be minimal when
compared to the *incredible* amount from the HEPlaR drive.  Once the
water is heated to a certain point all you\'ll get is increasingly
ionized hydrogen and oxygen without any increaing gains in thrust.

All thing considered, I\'ll stick to the HEPlaR as it is.  If you look
too closely at the \'science\' behind Traveller you\'ll find all kinds of
problems with it.

Remember to have fun and leave the \'Hard science\' out of Traveller.

 The Bwaps (or Newts) first appeared in JTAS #11 (pub. 1981), and have
only appeared once or twice in print aside from their Contact article.
I agree, this is a shame.  The reason for their effective disappearance
is fairly obvious, however, once you look back at the MegaTraveller
era and all of its problems.  The two people who created the Bwaps
were not really part of the Megatraveller period.  Both had other
projects to pursue (Battletech for one), and DGP found another
race (the Vilani) to take over the role of instinctive bureaucrats.
Of the two creators, one has come back to TNE with a vengeance, while
the other is trying his hand at the SF (non-gaming) market, having
exhausted Battletech\'s potential.  The two are Loren Wiseman and
Bill Keith.  With Loren back in the arena, we may see the Newts again.
Here\'s hoping.

 Actually, with a map, counters, and _visible_ movement system, BL is
easier to pick up.  The hard part is designing ships, not using them.

  TNE Rulebook, pages 241-244.  Maintenance points are the number of
hours per week a vehicle or other piece of hardware requires to run
risk-free.  For even small starships, this amounts to a full-time
job for several people.  Fortunately, many TNE skills are now both
\'use\' and \'maintenance\' skills, when they were just \'use\' skills in CT
and MT, so there are more maintenance personnel on-board a ship than
first appears.

  The number under "Calculating Maintenance Points" (the final step
in ship design) is the one to use.  As a house rule, you may want
to calculate this value both with and without Cargo mass included, to
give a better idea of the "ship only" maintenance requirements.
  Yes, the Maintenance Crew are "Technicians." They are hired for
their Mechanical, Electronics, Gravitics, Communications and related
skills, though Ship\'s Engineering is certainly appreciated.  Ship\'s
Engineering is non-optional for Engineering Crew, and the Chief should
have a touch of Starship Architecture as well.

 >...what exactly are Stewards, and why do you need them on
 >non-passenger ships?

  Even adventurers and Scouts appreciate someone who can cook.
  The formula for Stewards is such that you must be designing some
BIG ships to get Stewards without passengers.
  The Steward position is filled based on the Service skill (the
TNE equivalent of Steward) as well as other skills based on the
nature of the ship.  Stewards often double as Supercargo and Purser,
meaning Marketing, Liaison, Admin/Legal, and Bargain skills would
be important, plus whatever skill would serve to allow the Steward
to "perform maintenance" on the Cargo (I admit I\'m at a loss here).
They can also serve as assistants to the Ship\'s Doctor, making a
bit of Medical(Trauma Aid) handy if they serve on a large liner.

You said the TNE rules said use 2d6 + world size for atmosphere.

The old rules (CT and MT) both use 2d6 - 7 + world size.

I would assume the TNE rules have a typo (the other possibility being that
you read the rules wrong; I don\'t have TNE so I can\'t check this out).

    'body' => 'Hi, the following might apply to CT, MT or possibly even TNE?

This is probably a subject that went out with the ark (well with the start of
TNE anyway) but I wondered if anyway had ever simplified the MT combat system.
All the multipliers seemed to create either little or an excess of damage,
while being too complex for my bunch of (Wookie-IQ) players to handle.
So I came up with the following system (just in case anyone\'s interested):

1) Roll to hit as per the rules.

2) Damage is P + D - A + X where:
P = Weapon penetration value
D = 1 dice of damage per \'damage point\' given in the MT Player\'s book
A = 2 x Armour value
X = 1 extra dice of damage per category by which the To Hit roll exceeded the
    value required.

e.g. Bonzo\'s pistol at medium range happens to be rated as pen 2, dmg 3 and he
needs a 7 (Routine) to hit his target who is wearing a flak jacket (armour 4).

He rolls 10 which, including his skill of 2, gives 12 - a hit, and a high
enough roll to enter the next hit category ( Difficult: 11), hence getting
a bonus die on his damage to reflect a well-aimed shot.

He rolls 4d6 (3 dmg + 1 for the good dice roll) -> 14. Add penetration -> 16.
The armour effectively absorbs 8 points of this damage, so his target takes
8 points of damage.

3) Applying damage to stats
My characters use a Hit Point system (Yuck! That\'s for D&D players isn\'t it?).
The hit points are divided into two parts: the number of points of damage that
can be taken before causing unconsciousness, and the number beyond that to cause
death. The first value is the sum of the 2 highest attributes out of STR, DEX
and END. The second value is the remaining 3rd attribute.

e.g. Bonzo\'s target was Bilbo. Bilbo has S5 D7 E6, giving him hitpoints of 13/5
(i.e. once he\'s taken 13 points he\'s KO\'ed, if he ever takes more than 18 total
damage then it\'s tomb time).

Bilbo can happily take Bonzo\'s pistol shot without dying or even being KO\'ed
(assuming he had not been previously damaged).

However, there is an additional rule which deals with the shock effects of
being hit... any character taking _more_ damage in a round than his highest
atttribute value, is stunned for a round due to hydrostatic shock, etc.

So, Bilbo\'s highest is 7 (Dex) and he took 8 damage. Interpreting this for the
players, I tell Bonzo that he took aim and squeezed off what he thought must 
be a pretty good shot - it hit the target and knocked it over backwards. I then
tell Bilbo that he was hit and although the armour took half the damage, the
bullet penetrated and is wedged in his upper arm (area chosen at random), the
shock of the impact having caused him to fall over backwards. He will have to
lie there for one round, probably groaning and twitching a bit before his
head clears! If he\'d taken only 1-3 points of damage I\'d probably have said
that the bullet didn\'t penetrate but he took bruising damage.

The stats are usually written down as boxes or circles for each hit point, with
the points after unconsciousness being in a different size:

Bilbo: Hits: OOOOOOOOOOOOOooooo (Shock 8+)

Just cross \'em off as you take damage...

The system seems to work well with the players (I give them their doubled
armour values at the start to speed things up).

If you\'ve any thoughts, please don\'t hesitate to call...

technology has been changed in TNE -- if it\'s the Imperium I want
thruster plates :-). Certain planets in the region I\'m designing will be
quite detailed, using sections of DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook and my

However, there are instances where my own skill and judgement doesn\'t
cover the gaps in what I want to do. Specifically, has anyone either
any pointers or any views on how a star affects life on its planets in

          you\'re  clicking up almost 1000  kph.  Then  radar
          shows two traces converging on you. Their ID\'s are
          local police, but a Gauss blast soon shows they\'re
          not  about to hand out a speeding ticket....
          Referee:   The  speeders  are  modified  Venery\'s,

          of Hilary  would throw her company, and a sizeable
          part of the world\'s business, into disarray. In an
          economic coup Lucan\'s followers will take control,
          and so save the expense of a bloody assault.

life, mutation rate, etc.
 
My only suggestion (besides DGP World Builders handbook) is a BASIC program
published back in the days of Creative Computing.  You would select a main
sequence star and put in some basic info about your planet and the program
would generate min and max yearly temps, suggested climate, and suggested
lifeforms.  The program takes into account the effects of the planets moons,
axial tilt, and orbital eccentricity.  A fun program to play with.  I cannot
handle planets orbiting gas giants.  Only earthlike planets orbiting single
stars.
 
Does anyone know if this program exists in a ftp archive somewhere?  Another
good place to ask would be sci.space.
 
Worse comes to worse I could find my copy of the program (TRS-80 BASIC or
GWBASIC (I said the program was old) ) and uuencode an ascii basic version of
it.  It was basic BASIC which should run on any computer with BASIC.
 
Hope that helps :-)

  Nope. I\'m looking at indexing TNE for in-office use (and if I

Someone wrote a while back about Stars and how they affect life on their
planets. Here\'s my 0.02 800-pound chariot wheels on the subject...
Hotter stars emit more harmful radiation than cooler stars - this means 
that life on planets orbiting Type F stars (and G0 and G1 V stars) would
either mutate more quickly (assuming their planet\'s ozone layer was about
as thick as ours), or there would have to be a thicker ozone layer over
the planet. Presumably, type K and M stars would emit much less UV 
radiation (being redder), so ozone layers wouldn\'t have to be quite as thick.

Potted guide to planetary systems (a la Hard Science)...

The more massive the star, the more short-wavelength radiation it emits (ie.
UV - although there\'s not that many stars that are hot enough to emit 
X-rays!). However, the more massive the star, the shorter it lives - it burns
up its fuel much faster. From what I can gather, a Type O0 V star will have
a total lifespan, from birth to death as a black hole, of less than 1 million
years!. On the other hand, the lowest mass stars (ie. M9 V\'s and VI\'s) will
stay as Type V\'s for well over 60,000 BILLION years. This is far greater than
the age of the Universe (about 15 billion years), which means that any Type M
stars born 15 billion years ago (at the start of star formation in the 
Universe) would still be in their infancy.

The age and lifespan of the star makes a big difference to the formation of
planets around it. High mass stars (Type O and B) burn their fuel so rapidly
that they destroy themselves as Supernovae well before any planets even have
a chance to form in the dust clouds that surround them, so no planets will be
present around these stars (apart from the odd captured planet). Certainly,
no life can exist around these stars (if only due to the torrent of UV
radiation emanating from these stars) - no ozone layer could shield a planet
in this situation.	
	Type A stars are more moderate than their larger cousins. They can 
exist for timescales of a few million years, while late Type A stars (A5 V +)
break through the one billion year barrier. These stars probably have planets
in tow, there being enough time for them to coalesce around their stars.
However, these worlds probably won\'t have any life. Life on Earth has taken
about 3.8 billion years to reach the level it has today - advanced multi-
cellular lifeforms first appeared about 700 million years ago at the 
earliest. Assuming this is the case for all potentially life-bearing
worlds, the planet (and oceans) would have to exist for at least 3 billion
years to evolve multi-cellular life, while single-celled organisms and amino
acids could start to form around 800 million - 1 billion years after the
planet formed. So, the earliest Type A stars (ie. A0V to A5V) won\'t have life
(probably) while the later ones (say, A7V - A9V) will probably have simple
single-celled organisms, assuming oceans are present on the planet. However,
these organisms will not have time to evolve into higher organisms because
their Primary star will turn enter its Subgiant and Giant phases only a 
billion years after its formation, killing off all life on the planet.
	Type F and G stars are those most likely to possess highly evolved
life, having a long enough lifespan and emitting bearable amounts of radiation.
I think that F8 V stars are the first to have main Sequence Lifespans longer
than 4 billion years, which means that life may have evolved to current (Terran)
levels by the end of the star\'s useful lifetime. Type F stars emit more UV than
our own Sun, which is a Type G2 V star. The Sun has a total lifespan of about
10 billion years, and we\'re about halfway through. It has existed for 4.6 
billion years or so.
	Stars less massive than Sol (the Sun) have a longer lifespan - they 
also emit less radiation. As a result of their longer lifespan, some examples
of these stars were born early in the history of the Universe. There are two
types of star - Population I and Population II. The earliest known stars
are Population I, and most of these are Type K and M V stars. These are
\'first-generation\' stars, and as such are composed entirely of Hydrogen
and Helium, with very little heavy elements. This is because they formed
before any massive stars had exploded as supernovae, releasing heavy elements
into the interstellar medium. (Actually, the more I think about it, the more
I think that Population I stars are actually Subdwarfs (type VI), since these
stars are also metal-poor). The net result is that if the stars are composed
of Hydrogen and Helium, then so too should their planets. As a result, all the
planets of these stars would probably be Gas Giants, with very few solid bodies
in the system, since no rock or metal is around for them to form.
	Population II stars are those stars that formed in a metal-rich 
intersellar environment, such as the one present today. These include all stars
that have formed in the past 10 - 12 billion years. Since low-mass stars can
form in this time period (not all had to form in the earliest days of the Unive se), then there are plently of Type K and M stars out there with rocky 
planets around them.
	Type K stars are probably the borderline for habitable planets. Type M
stars are just too dim to generate enough heat to warm planets at distances
beyond 0.2 AU. HOwever, it is interesting to note that during their Subgiant
phase (type IV), Type M stars spend a total of about 4 - 5 billion years. In
this stage, they can warm planets for long enough to allow life to form. THe
only problem is that no Type M star (not even one born 10 billion years ago)
will turn into a Subgiant for another 50 billion years!!!!
	OK, that\'s it. Any comments, opinions etc are welcome. Hope it helped.

He asked me to delist him from TML, because his "address was going

Hi All,

I recently received the CT items that I ordered from GDW from Loren\'s
TML post. I think that this is a great way to find out what GDW has in
stock without harrassing them regularly. BTW, reading through some 
new (to me) CT materials has cleared up something I\'ve wondered about.

I was 16 in 1983 when I bought the majority of the GDW traveller 
product line. Since then I\'ve always felt that those materials were
superior to anything put out since. There was a feeling of optimistic
adventure to those supplements, rulebooks, and adventures. I always
attributed this feeling to the fact that I was 16 when I refereed 
those materials. But, 10 years later I find that the feeling is still
the same. 

I guess maybe I wasn\'t just a silly teenager to have loved this stuff.
Or, maybe it\'s just that now I\'m a silly adult.
 
Anyway....

I\'d like to recreate that environment in TNE. I noticed vanya\'s post 
recently concerning boosting starship G-turn endurance by cutting 
the reaction mass by a factor of 10. I\'ve tried this, and it does help.
Now, I\'d like to reduce the overhead in crew requirements back to 
previrus conditions. Maybe then a tramp freighter will be able to 
earn a living in this universe again.

TTFN

I didn\'t know there was software to help ease some of the tedious part of
Traveller.  I assume it helps with world generation, character generation
and other lengthy tasks.  Can anyone tell me more about it?

be overwhelmed with questions and debates over what are, IMHO, minutia.

other games like 2300AD.)

I\'ve never been one to be too concerned with details of the rules.
(I just hold to the First Rule of Role Playing:  If the Rules Don\'t
Work the Way You\'d Like - Change Them - It\'s Just a Game.).  I\'m more
concerned with the `Big Picture\'.  Is there anyone else who thinks
discussions about weapon penetration, craft design, and planetary
science is a little moot in a two-dimensional universe?

(I\'m not trying to hassle you `rules junkies\' - I\'m just looking for
some like-minded-souls of my own.)

In an effort to start a `Background\' discussion, here\'s a question:  What
is there to recommend TNE (vs. MT or CT) from a `background\' point of
view?  Forget the new rules and such, is the new campaign an improvement
over the ante-Rebellion, Rebellion and Hard Times eras?  (For the sake 
of discussion let\'s ignore the hard, cold reality that TNE is the only
campaign being supported officially.)

Cordially,

Not to contradict our beloved TML admin, but I\'ve been on and off
Sunbane, Prism, and Nova many times over the last week, including
an ftp to Sunbane just minutes ago, and it works just fine.  Maybe
it has something to to with the path from Sunbane to you folks,
rather than a problem on the Sunbane end.  Or...

 ...maybe you should switch brands of coffee. :^)

BTW, I haven\'t heard from Dan Corrin for a *loooong* time.  I sent
him some mail over a month ago and *still* have received a reply.

FADE IN:


CROWDED ARCADE
Long lines of people queue and lights play over colourful posters of 
RealVision\'s latest Bughunt on Rlyeh game. Excited players emerge and make 
graphic gestures. Shops sell paraphaneila.


V.O.
Few people have missed the excitement generated by the recent RealVision game 
released by Red Wizard. In the simulated environment of the arcade players were 
armed with predictions of where current trends in current military hardware are 
tending.


CUT TO:


PAN OVER a COMPUTER SIM of platoon of troops wearing battle dress and hand-held 
fusion guns fashioned with the imperial starburst.


V.O. (CONT)
Even with such hardware no group of players were found that were a match for 
the aliens. 


CAMERA FOLLOWS the paltoon and we see them being cut to bits by aliens.


V.O. (CONT)
In keeping with Red Wizard\'s True-To-Life garuntee the game was assured to 
strictly adhere to the defined RealVision standards of simulation. So how was 
such a devestatingly powerful creation discovered?


CUT TO:


COMPUTER LINE DRAWING of the previous fight scene. After the scene is played 
through it freezes on the alien which then changes slightly.


V.O. (CONT)
In every dynamic system there exists maximum points. Points of possibility 
where the parameters give ideal results for the desired result. Through 
infinate regression tests and self correcting simulations the idea parameters 
for a creature of destruction within the RealVision simulated environment was 
found.

FREEZE FRAME on final alien.

FADE TO

poster of Alien in the same pose with some players frozen in animated 
converstation before it.


V.O.
The same techniques used for this game monster are not solely applicable within 
the realm of Virtual Reality. Within the operation of our reality and through 
the medium of genetic codes the same regression tests have produced similar 
results.


FADE TO BLACK. MUSIC PLAYS.

COMPUTER GEN PIX: Deep space, a b.g. of stars. Centered is AN ALIEN, sideview, 
curled into a fetallike ball. 


V.O.
Humans suffer from self-centered notions as to the nature of life.


The Alien slowly uncurls. MUSICAL STING.


V.O. (CONT.)
Humans assume that alien life forms should conform to standards that match 
their own, including logic and mortlity.


The Alien is uncurled in its full glory now. Slowly it rotates to face the 
camera. MUSIC CONTINUES OVER.


V.O. (CONT.)
Even among humans, mortality is ignored when expedient. Why should we expect 
more from an alien life form than we demand from ourselves?


The Alien stretches out its arms and legs and tail so that it becomes a parody 
of the man\'s-reach-should-equal-his-height illustration by Da Vinci. PUSH IN 
SLOWLY. The Alien expands to fill the screen.


V.O. (CONT)
If we know nothing else, we must know this about aliens: First, they will not 
be like us. Secondly, truly understanding them will be almost imposible.


THE ALIEN fills the screen; DIAL DOWN MUSIC and PUSH THROUGH TO BLACK.


CUT TO:


EXT. ALIEN WORLD -- DAY -- ESTABLISHING


Here is a bleak, rocky planet. Very little greenery, vast stretches of nothing.


V.O.
From the dense exoskeleton of the alien and its demonstrated adaptbility, we 
can see that it is at home even on a planet that is a harsh, desolate place.


CUT TO:


EXT. HIVE


This is a ridged, antlike mound rearing up from the cleared area around it, a 
thing composed of alien spittle, laced with local plants and the exoskeletons 
of alien prey.


V.O.
We know from simulation that the aliens have a queen-based hierarchy and that 
they form hives to protect their eggs and young hatchlings.


INT. HIVE -- EGG CHAMBER


The giant QUEEN, monstrous egg sac attached to her rear, depositis eggs on the 
floor of the chamber.


V.O.
At the proper time, drone workers provide host bodies for the newborns.


TIME CUT TO:


INT. EGG ROOM


A GROUP OF PREY BEASTS held in place by WORKER ALIENS are attached by 
HATCHLINGS IN THEIR LARVAL FORM. (These are hand-shaped lumps with fingers and 
tails, the latter of which wrap around the prey beasts\' necks to secure them as 
the ovipositors are extruded and inserted down the prey\'s throats. See 
comp-image #3 for stock footage.)


V.O.
The parasitical breeding process is offensive to some in the military community 
but completely natural for aliens living in a harsh environment.


CUT TO:


PREY BEAST


Its bellly bulges from within. It screams, but silently, (MOS).


V.O.
Birth of the next stage is violent and fatal for the host.


C.U. -- PREY\'S BELLO


The skin bursts, tissue spews, and A BABY ALIEN, looking like a fat snake with 
sharp teeth, emerges.


V.O. (CONT.)
The young alien chews its way forth, where there may be a battle for dominance 
with other newly born aliens.


A GROUP OF BABY ALIENS


rip and tear at each other.


CUT TO:


EXT. G-CARRIER


The carrier lifdts from the planet\'s surface.


V.O.
Humans rely on technology to the point where they beleive it has made them 
invincible. When dealing ith creatures who have been adapted to extremely 
hostile evironments, such a belief can also prove dangerous.


CLOSER -- ON THE CARRIER


Clutching a strut on the carrier\'s underside is AN ALIEN.


V.O. (CONT)
Because an unsuited human cannot survive in the vacuum of space does not mean 
that some other complex life form cannot.


INT. PATROL CRUISER -- CARGO BAY -- HIGH ANGLE


Across the bay walk TWO TROOPS.


POLL BACK TO OTS (OVER-THE-SHOULDER) -- ALIEN


It watches the troops. Drool drips from its lethal jaws.
ALIENS\'S POV -- THE TROOPS


It moves in. They react in horror as it attacks. BLOOK SPLASHES, blanking the 
VP.


CUT TO:


INT. AIRLOCK


The hatch opens and the Alien is ejected by the outward blast of atmosphere. 
TRACK WITH IT as it flies into space, turning slowly.


V.O.
From the simulations we can deduce that they have simple imperitives that 
control their lives. They kill, they breed, and they survive.


THE ALIEN


floats int he vacuum. It should be dead by human stantards, but it slowly curls 
intoa fetal ball, tail wrapped around the massive claw-hammer head and spiky 
body.


V.O.
Properly utailised, such aliens would make excellent warriors. Research into 
the synthesis of their composition could yield advances in armour, chemical and 
biological weapons, and perhaps even new ways to induce suspended animation for 
frozen watch troops.


PULL BACK -- THE ALIEN


Dwindles into a tiny dot, then vanishes altogether into the cold blackness.

There\'s nothing much wrong with the information in the Souts book.

the main reason why some things were changed in World Builders\' Handbook
was to make it _easier_ for world builders.

If, for instance, you want to calculate a world\'s albedo, Book 6 lets
you do it.  WBH gives you a table, in case you DON\'T want to HAVE
to calculate it.

Just be very careful if you use BOTH books.  Sometimes the WBH formulas
were simplified for ease of use.  The formulas in Book 6 are more complicated,
but more accurate (and more flexible, which from a GM\'s perspective
is _really_ the important point).

Howdoo All!
	Yet another questionette for you all. I notice that Thruster Plates
do not require fuel (directly) to operate - they just burn up power plant
fuel when they draw their operating power. Since they don\'t themselves
burn any fuel like HEPlaR does, then does this mean that the concept of
G-Hours goes out of the proverbial window for Thruster Plates?
	I did a bit of calculating, and found that at TL 12, Fusion Power
plants use 0.15 kl of fuel per year (actually, I wonder if this is the
fuel consumption per kl of power plant, and not for the plant as a whole).
If say, the Thrusters required 187.5 MW of power to run, then this means
that they require (187.5 / 0.15 =) 28.125 kl of LHyd fuel to operate for 
one whole YEAR!! So, effectively, one G-hour of fuel in this case works out
to be 0.00107 kl of fuel per hour of continuous operation. This seems to
indicate that you don\'t need to carry around much fuel to use your 
thruster plates, and if the fuel tankage is large enough, you\'d only need
to refuel your maneuver drive once per year at most!! Thus, you have an
effectively infinite number of G-hours of fuel.
	Does this make sense to people, or am I barking up the wrong tree
completely here?! If I am right, then what does this do to the G-Hour
concept, which seems to be rather important in Space Travel as it stands in
TNE and FF&S? 
	Opinions, comments etc on a postcard please....
PS. Further to my previous (LONG!!!) post (Stars and Planets...), I forgot
to mention a rather good book called \'What If The Moon Didn\'t Exist?\', by
Neil. F. Comins (published by Harper-Collins, price $20). This book is 
excellent for any prospective planet-builders out there, as it goes through
lots of \'What If\' questions about the Earths that might have been. 
Specifically, it tells you what life would be like if: the moon didn\'t exist
(natch), the moon was closer to the Earth, the Sun was more massive, the 
Earth was tilted at 90 degrees, the Earth was smaller, a star went Supernova
near the Solar System, a Star passes through the Solar System, a black hole
passed through the Earth (?!), and if the ozone layer didn\'t exist (very
topical!!). So, if you want to know what the environment would be on planets
that you build that don\'t have any moons, or orbit bigger stars, or any of
the above, this is the book for you. Its very \'reader-friendly\', and doesn\'t
throw any equations or anything like that at you. Its basically a VERY good
book.
	Also, you could do no worse that have a look through \'Astronomy\'
magazine. Every now and then, somebody writes an article that exercises the
imagination (a lot of the things in the aforementioned book appeared in this
magazine first). Also, there is the occasional article about stars and the
different type thereof (James B. Kaler writes some good articles on this
subject, and has published a rather good book called \'Stars and their 
Spectra\' which is good but assumes some previous astronomical knowledge. He\'s
also written a book called \'Stars\' which is the same sort of thing, but much
simpler. Both books are very good if you want more info on Stellar 
Evolution).
	I hope that\'s helped anyone who\'s interested in some background
reading, or just plain interested in astronomy.

notes: 

This is basically a TL14 craft, but I used a TL13 power plant for
maintenance reasons, since it was just as good for the purpose. The TL15
equivalent power plant is 13 m^3, 26t, and MCr2.6 so is definitely
worthwhile, unless used where maintenance of TL15 will be a problem.

The TL15 version of this craft costs approximately the same (if
available), but the power plant, the computers and other electronics are
smaller, so it has an additional 15 m^3 or so of space available for
cargo or other use (fuel purification machinery for example). Also, at
TL15 the control points are sufficient that an electronics crewman is
unnecessary.

This design is intended to be launch-bay interchangeable with the 
standard ship\'s boat. (The standard ship\'s boat is considerably heavier,
due primarily to its TL12 power plant.)

It\'s fairly common to run this with two crew. It\'s also fairly common
for double occupancy staterooms, so up to six (including crew) can travel.

Higher jump capability actually works out to about the same overall
space, due to increased fuel efficency. for a jump/4 version the jump
drive becomes 21 m^3. Reducing the fuel capacity to 150 m^3 still allows
four parsecs of jump plus 24 gturns, plus we\'ve gained 12.6 m^3 of space.

Summary of TL15 version: jump/4, fuel scoops & purification, slight
increase in cargo space, increased flexibility in crewing.

  Thanks for the update, Loren!  Is the Aliens book you mentioned the
`Aliens of the Rim\' book listed in the upcoming product release list?
  From the way you mentioned the Newts, the contents of that book hasn\'t
been finalized.  I know Vargr aren\'t `Rim Aliens\', but they are frightfully
popular (at least with Traveller folk I know).  Player Character generation
rules for the Vargr would be `A Good Thing\' to have.
  As for aliens along the Rim...Hivers (and their reptilian mercs), Aslan,
and Vir...how do you spell that?  The big rhino sized pacifists from Reavers
Deep.
  Speaking of Aslan, the RC should run into Aslan Clan ships or bases on or
about the same time they contact Regency scouts.  What\'s the RC view on
Aslan expansion?

more errata published as I believe I found a minor error with the PAW design
in FF&S but no mention in the errata ?

 Being a design weenie from way back (Striker and High Guard were two of my 
favorite books from CT) I set out to build something from FF&S. As I hadn\'t seen
any PAW bays in Brilliant Lances I figured I\'d design one (I\'ll post the designs
in a later message). I really like how we can design all sorts of weaponry now.
The minor error I mentioned is to do with damage calculation. Meson guns and 
lasers explicitly say that 1/R^2 can\'t be greater than one, but the PAW design
sequence doesn\'t. It makes sense that PAWs should be the same and the PAW 
spinal mounts in BL seem to follow that rule.

 I also played a game of BL with a couple of friends. As none of us had played
it before it was fairly slow going to start with, but even after we had got 
the hang of the rules, the damage calculation part seemed quite time consuming.
We all came to the conclusion that it would benefit greatly from computer
assistance. The critical hits are also quite brutal. We played with a 
Chrysanthemum class Destroyer Escort versus three Gazelles. The Chrysanthemum
didn\'t have any missiles (to simplify things) and didn\'t use the sandcasters
(because I forgot 8-), but was able to waste the Gazelles because the 1000Mj
PAWs were doing two critical hits if they hit hull without surface features.

 Before I finish, how could I comment on TNE without mentioning The Virus. I\'ve
never been quite as violently opposed to The Virus as some members of this 
list ;-), but I have to admit it is _really_ depressing looking at those 
before and after subsector listings and seeing all those XXX000-0 planets that
used to be thriving societies.

In response to Loren\'s surprise at the interest in Bwaps -- Mine, at least,
was fueled not so much by the specifics of Bwaps, but the fact that they
were supposed to be commonplace in the Third Imperium and, if that\'s the
case, we know a pitifully small amount about them.  Ithklur are
likewise somewhat underrepresented when their frequency is considered.

Robots and certain Minor Races are underdeveloped in terms of their
described frequency in the Third Imperium culture.  This is probably
more a side effect of not having wholly developed the Third Imperium
setting in one lump.  Allowing it to evolve has in some ways made the
background flexible but has also resulted in what I\'d term continuity
holes.

Although I\'m interested to learn that Robots are going to be covered in
the as yet un-named supplement about the Virus, I\'m also curious to know
if the supplement will permit the construction of non-Virus infected
robot systems and AIs...

     I certainly am.  I\'m always looking for good ideas for scenarios.
The people I play with tend to be rather creative and inventive, so I
have to run full speed just to keep abreast of them.  ;-)

     Not necessarily.  It can be quite a bit of fun, if you\'re a
technology junkie like I am.  Of course, the system has quite an
influence on this, as well as the background.  Actually, the background
has an influence on every part of a game (even the rules lawyers).

 >from a \'background\' point of view?
 
     Bear in mind that answers to this question will be unavoidably
subjective.
 
     In my honest opinion, there is *nothing* to recommend the New Era
background over MegaTraveller or Classic Traveller.  To my mind, the
Virus environment is a giant step backward.  Technology has *regressed*.
This is not something that I am prepared to tolerate.  I\'ll probably
change over to the new rules system (mostly--G-turns?  I don\'t think so.
Virus?  Nope--ain\'t going to use it.), but the Virus-ridden low-tech
background goes out the window for me.  My game is going to very
abrubtly diverge from the officially supported one.  Heck, as far as my
game goes, the Rebellion never happened, either.
 
 >Forget the new rules and such, is the new campaign an improvement
 over the ante-Rebellion, Rebellion and Hard Times eras?
 
     Well, no.  Not for me, anyway.  Technology has always been the
primary focus of my interest in Science Fiction.  The new background
severely cripples the technology that I have become accustomed to.
 
     So, I have to fix things before I can use them.  Oddly enough, the
fix requires reversing many of the changes.  I find that rather ironic.

 While I admit to being a fan of TNE, my answer to this question must
be "it depends."
 The New Era has, thanks to the surviving Regency, more variety than
the previous eras.  It has old, well established civilization. It has
endless battles against a foe that nobody likes (even that foe\'s
relatives).  It has exploration and reclamation, salvage and new
construction.  Everywhere you look, there is an exploratory frontier
(as opposed to a political one, the only kind the previous eras knew).
 Granted, there are those Traveller players who _want_ a wide expanse
of "predictable" Imperial civilization, who want an Imperium at peace.
Depending on the scope of their games the Regency might be enough, but
probably not. I accept that.

 New Era: scrabble for basic supplies.
 Classic Era: scrabble for the next ship\'s payment.

 Classic Era: be shot at while breaking the law.
 New Era: be shot at while making the law.

 Classic Era: "It\'s two years cruising to Capital.  Who\'s going?"
 New Era: "This ain\'t the King Richard, boy, and that ain\'t a
    Customs cruiser.  Shoot the Vampire before it shoots you."

 Classic Era: "Time for annual maintenance. Where\'s the nearest A-port?"
 New Era: "Captain, we only made that jump because the coils like me.
    Unless you want to depend on that friendship, you\'ll find us a
    junkyard or a wreck I can plunder for new coils."

 Classic Era: "Hmm. The Second Survey must have missed these guys, but
    they sure look intelligent, don\'t they?"
 New Era: "Everything the old records say is suspect, and we can only
    verify the stellar type..."

 Classic Era: adventurers\' lives are a lesson in bad Karma.
 New Era: Live fast, kill Virus, make history. Screw Karma.

 Ahem.

  One of the biggest complaints about the Rebellion period was that it
quickly became "the largest spectator event in history".  By comparison,
Classic Traveller was going nowhere, doing nothing.  An ambitious
referee could chart his own major events for two reasons: the developed
parts of the Imperium were its frontiers, not the important stuff
around Capital; and there were no other major events that had to be
conformed to.  Every group has its own Imperium from that period.
  Then came the Rebellion, and MegaTraveller.  Most of us old Classic
players can remember the cold shiver we got when Traveller\'s Digest
#9 hit the stands: "Emperor Strephon Assassinated!"  We knew, even
then, that "our" Imperium had been taken away from us.  Most of us
looked on as MT supplements appeared, moving the Rebellion forward
while leaving us behind.  No more home-cooked "major" events; here
was the future plotted in detail.
  Finally came the news: The New Era.  DGP retreats in disarray. GDW
takes back Traveller.  There was much rejoicing... But what\'s this?
GDW says they\'re going to finish the job the Rebellion started, and
tear down the Imperium completely.  70 YEARS?!?  Caused by a COMPUTER
VIRUS?  Thus we arrive at today.  What is different from MT, you
ask?  Here we sit while GDW puts on the "Let\'s Rebuild the
Imperium" show.
  Unlikely. At best. Recall, those of you who have the material, that
the Spinward Marches were settled by the expanding Third Imperium
in the 300\'s!  This was during an era of optimistic expansion and
exploration, with no Virus to slow them down. Three HUNDRED years
from Capital to Regina.  In this light, I don\'t think the maps will
change much, except to get more informative, unless GDW keeps
the calendar going breakneck.  Lines of communication will open
within the first 40 or 50 years sufficient to allow the historical
quotes in the TNE book, but actual sovereign borders will change
very slowly.  Pocket Empires will boom to a point, then discover that
quarantine is impossible on an expanding border. The RCES makes no
bones about expansion, but suffers the same problems of secure
borders.  The Regency won\'t advance a single parsec without extensive
cleansing operations and establishment of new links in the Quarantine
Line, and will reach the trailing end of Corridor to face the realities
of a Line that is not just advancing, but expanding as well. All while
recalling that the Line is held by charisma-happy Vargr in places
beyond the Regency\'s control. Enough to give a Regent nightmares.
  No, the map will not change quickly.  And when it does, there will
always be areas of the Third Imperium that will not come under the new
flag for centuries or more. Pick the right spot for your campaign and
have no interference from GDW, major events or no, for 50-150 years.
I strongly suspect that the interior of the Regency will be one of
those areas, barring initial development for the New Era.  Each
group can have "its own" New Era, knowing (and caring) only that
the universe gets a little bigger, and a little more Virus-free,
with each passing year.

   Thruster plates supply thrust as long as you feed them juice, without
the need of reaction mass.  They have effectively unlimited g-hours.  These
are the reactionless drives from classic/Mega Traveller.

That\'s the fuel consumption per year per MW.

Hi, Rodge here.
 
 
I agree with David Johnson.
 
My head is spinning.  I just read buns 543 to 553 (1 month of
messages).  I\'ve heard of getting bogged down in the rules, but I
never imagined just how far that concept could be taken.
 
Just as David pointed out, the emphasis here lately does indeed seem
to be in the intricacies of the rules (equipment and how it works, the
laws of physics, critiques of rules releases, politics, etc.).  All
very fascinating to be sure.
 
But something seems to be missing.
 
To me, the word "Traveller" evokes thoughts and feelings of...
 
    DANGER!                 FACING THE ENEMY!
        ACTION!                DEATH DEFYING FEATS!

                     (just kidding)
 
 
In a word, "roleplaying."

What adventures have you run lately?
 
Any cool stories to tell?
 
How did your players wriggle free from the grasp of death?  Or
did they die wimpering on the end of a spit?
 
I for one would like to hear your ongoing storyline, or any portion of
it you would like to tell.
 
And, if you are interested, I\'ll look through my game log for a juicy
adventure or two to tell.  That is, if you like to talk about these
kinds of things here (playing the game).  I run a Traveller game
session (almost) every weekend, so I\'ve got quite a few scenarios
piled up.

    'body' => 'David Johnson(djohnson@geds01.jsc.nasa.gov) asked for more postings on 
assessing and using the TNE background as opposed to rules discussions.

It is quite natural for there to be a lot of rules discussion when a new rules
set comes out, especially when it modifies the previous history of the
Traveller background to the extent that TNE did. With time these postings will
decrease in volume.

Concerning the TNE setting, its strengths are its weaknesses. The major
advantages of TNE over CT/MT are (a) no knowledge of previous history is
necessary, reducing the amount of reading for new players; (b) apart from 
the Regency, everywhere is a frontier zone ripe for re-exploration and 
rediscovery; (c) the Virus, although mostly under control, is still an
ever-present threat and has massively reduced automation, putting emphasis back
on the skills of people. The disadvantages are that (a) previous history and 
technology is changed, to the detriment of continuity for some campaigns; 
(b) apart from the Recency, nowhere is really safe as everywhere is a frontier
 zone; and (c) the Virus is a flagrant Plot Device, and questions such as 
 whether something as complicated as a starship could be operated by manual 
control with minimal computer assistance are ignored.(I can just see the
astrogator tapping in the millions of parameters for a jump from one computer
to another by hand without any mistakes(no error-checking, that would be too
dangerous) :-).  

I personally do not like the TNE background, and think there are gaping holes
in the logic behind it. GDW seem eager to encourage a "Merc 2000 in outer
space" mentality in an attempt to attract new players. They are a business and
want to make a profit, so that is their right. They are also more comfortable
with wargames than with RPG\'s and wish to stick to their area of expertise.
Anyone who seeks a non-military style of play will probably have to do most of
the work in setting up such a campaign themselves. Still, now we\'re stuck with
it, and live must go on.

However, TNE can and is being used for campaigns right now. Playing in a
"Return from the Dark Ages" campaign could be very interesting, depending on
how it was run.

Our gaming group consists of two factions. The newbies and those who
know who Strephon is/was.

The new era has allowed me to reconcile these groups without
frustrating the oldies too much. The newbies play HIver techs and
Thugs etc and the others play Pre-Collapse Revenants.

I learned more about the Imperium from reading Survival margin than
from any other book...I deemed the Rebellion sourcebook to be a bit
of a waste. The old Empire wasn\'t alive the way TNE is. The Imperium
has a wealth of background and what isnt there can be created by
those people who are inventive enough. Most of my campaigns in the
past were almost exclusively hard Times...not because I had the
Supplement because it hasn\'t been seen here in Sunny Northern
ireland. The main reason was that I knew a bit about it and decided
that giving the players a HARD TIME rather than a soft cushy empire
was infintely preferable.

I was cowed when I played Traveller with other groupos
though..especially at Conventions. Rules are made ot be broken but
those old timers who didnt like the new RULES system were also
determined to give the background a good dig as well. 

I feel the system is an improvement. Old timers dont have to play it
and they don\'t have to play the new background. Isn\'t that nice of
GDW to give you a choice. You KNEW what is was going to be
like...from the release of Survival Margin...you knew the system was
going to be amalgamated with Twilight and dark Conspiracy. 

You didnt have to buy it.

If you did anyway...who\'s fault is it? GDWs?

Well thats my ...uh six guineas, three shillings and sixpence.

Well it looks like all the moans about GDW\'s massive incompetence
and discussions over obscure traveller/science facts has all moved
to the gdw-beta list. Pity, that\'s what I really liked about the 
TML, but I\'m sure all the TNE players out there wouldn\'t agree...

I just thought I\'d try answering a few questions people asked 
yesterday. (It\'s either that or my \'why TNE is trash\' flame, and
I\'m still collecting evidence for that)

"Michael A. Masten" asked
>I have a question about the Virus that keeps getting mentioned in TNE.
>What is it and where did it come from?

What is it?-  A computer virus that turned every computer bigger
 than a desktop into an A.I. and then destroyed that computer,also
 using any devices that computer controlled to kill as many people
 as possible (which with computer controlled life support systems,
 vehicles and weapons meant a LOT of people). It spread throughout
 inhabited space, except for the area spinward of Corridor which
 somehow managed to isolate itself by preventing infected ships
 entering. Most planets simply died without high technology or
 trade, the rest went back to the dark ages.

What is it?2- depending on peoples point of view, it is also-
  1) a way to turn Traveller into a \'Dark Future\' RPG, while still
     being able to say \'No, it\'s about REBUILDING society, honest-
     we only need the Fusion Rifles for our own protection\'
  2) a way to release a new Traveller set that didn\'t need new 
     players to learn the whole Imperial background (destroying
     90% of it may have rather overdone the idea)
  3) a way to clean out a background that was just too big and 
     complex for the new design team to cope with.
  4) a way to destroy the Imperial background... just because they
     could.
  5) a way to annoy me- personally :)

Where did it come from?- The Imperium designed it itself (I think
 it was an Imperial Naval Inteligence project originally). The 
 A.I. routines came from the Cymberline (sp?) intelligent silicon
 chips out of the old Signal GK adventure- it was claimed they had
 actually been discovered years ago but covered up while the 
 research was underway. Designed as a Doomsday weapon,
 it was accidently released during the Rebellion. 

Where did it come from?2- again, depending on who you ask-
   1) TNE designers-  Frank and Dave (the Game Guys)
   2) several other people- but don\'t claim GDW nicked any ideas
      off you, or they\'ll sue!
   3) someone who didn\'t know squat about computers or the Traveller
      background 
   4) a bad dream


   And, if you ARE considering changing to TNE, be warned that the
 only things that changed over from CT with no real changes are the
 planet generation and trade rules, and with most of the Imperium
 having a population code of 0, what use are they?. It is annoying
 when weapons change weights, prices, ammo etc- even moreso when 
 ships change cargo space, crew etc.

Good point about the 2D Universe.

Well I\'d put myself more in the rules-junkie area, but like most
Traveller players (I suspect) I\'ve stuck with it because of the
background, not the rules. 

As for the merits of various backgrounds, the only \'merit\' I can 
see in TNE is that the \'area of interest\' i.e. the area that the
published background covers, is less \'civilised\'. PCs have more of
a chance to act as bloodthirsty criminals and get away with it, with
smaller governments or no government in most areas. It has an
advantage- with all these smaller ponds PCs have more chance to be
big fish, which should suit some people and could be interesting
if they use this power for anything other than stealing chickens.
However, most Arses background I\'ve seen implies they prefer to
\'shoot people with big guns\'- I get the impression it\'s this that\'s
making TNE so popular (not on this mature list of course :>)
 That you could do all this in CT, just outside of the Imperium,
means TNE has no real improvement over CT. But, again, it depends
who you ask...

I liked your article on Star/Planet types- I\'ve never seen an RPG
that dealt clearly with the issue of steller lifetimes and heavy
element distribution- the \'star wars\' style players may not need
it but some of us try to fit a bit of realism inbetween the FTL drives
and reationless thrusters. Those notes you did look quite useful,
thanks for posting them.

 Now, HEPlaR vs. Thrusters... Oh boy, when did you get here?
You certainly missed the big fight over Fusion Drives when TNE 
came out. Here\'s a short history of Traveller Drives-
 1) Classic Traveller- Drives move your ship from 1-6G, it\'s left
    to the Ref to descibe how they work. Some assume Scramjet and
    Fusion, some use reactionless thrusters, some ignore it etc.
    It all seemed to work fine (I suspect most Refs used some form
    of safe drive after the players started trying to use it as a
    weapon.)
 2) First Edition High Guard- for this one book, there was a mention
    of drives using fusion. It was removed in the 2nd Ed. Maybe they
    realised how dangerous that was.
 3) MegaTraveller. Thruster Plates are Official- put the power in,
    your ship goes. Forget about reaction mass. Nice and safe.
 4) Traveller-The New Error. Fusion Drives are back again, except
    they call them HEPlaR and claim they are safe, even if they do
    produce exhaust as hot and fast as any Fusion Drive. Rough
    calculations showed that any 100T+ ship could incinerate a city
    from orbit. The arguement over whether to -ignore physics and
    make it useless as a weapon/ stick with thruster plates/ use
    the drive realistically and give players a reusable nuclear
    weapon - was the closest thing to a flame-war seen on the TML
   
   Basically, you are barking up the right tree. Thruster Plates
  work by converting electrical power into thrust, breaking lots
  of Physical Laws, no reaction mass needed. No fuel for the Drive
  AT ALL. Run them off batteries or Solar Cells, no fuel or reaction
  mass need be in the vehicle. This is much more useful than
  HEPlaR of course, if you read FF&S it basically explains why
  Thruster Plates are so bad (never mind they used to be in
  Traveller). Actually I thought FF&S explained most of what you
  asked, but being GDW it\'s STILL difficult to follow unless you\'ve
  read everything from CT Book 2 ,then Book 5, then Striker
  then MT.
   Final Note- Remember that Thrusters no longer exist in the
  \'official\' Traveller background. Thruster Plates are so useful
  that HEPlaR is obsolete if they exist. Still, it\'s so much
  cheaper that it has uses...

   Re; Constantine\'s question on Thruster Plates-
I\'ve already sent a post where I waffle on about Traveller drives (I haven\'t
recieved any sign it reached the list yet, I\'ll assume it has). Anyway after
reading the TML at more leisure I realised I was so busy talking about the 
drives I never answered your question on whether G-turns apply with Thruster
Plates. The real answer is that G-turns don\'t apply with Thruster plates at
all, the amount of time that ship can thrust just depends on how long you can
keep that power plant running. And yes, that is a year if you use a fusion
plant. 
 Also, you are right in assuming it uses fuel PER KL of power plant... actually
in the old days it was measured PER MW of power plant, so check that table
carefullly.
                  Don\'t you wish people would actually READ the posts they
                                                           reply to?

placed on the nightly digest list.  I think it will be more mangable.
     I have been a Traveller player for quite a long time and just recently
started GMing.  I think your newsletter is just what I have been looking for.
 
     One thing that I did not quite understand is are you asking for my home
address or just my electronic address.  I am still very new to Internet and
get confussed rather easily on the Electronic Super Highway.  I still haven\'t
found a good map to guide me.

Thank You

    YES! While I loved CT\'s rules, and find T:TNE workable, it\'s the
background that\'s drawn me over the years. I guess I just get lost in hi-tech
discussions of the physics of systems that defy the laws of physics as we
know them. Most of the time, they really don\'t even affect the game that
much.
    For my 2 crs worth, I loved CT\'s background, but never really saw why the
Imperium\'s grasp on its world was so tenuous as to allow for interstellar
mini-wars. I think the new setting works much better as an area for
adventurer exploration....though I\'d love to see more info from the Spinward
Marches. Call me a romantic, but I miss the old Empire. I still think of the
Zhodani as the ultimate enemy. 
    And while I can accept two-dimensionality on the Imperial maps, 2-D
Brilliant Lances seems rather more silly at times.

 Sigh.  To put the record straight, the term "G-Hours" (or "G-Turns")
has two uses.  One of these _always_ applies. Repeat: Always.

 Acceleration in TNE space combat is measured in G-Hours.  No matter
which thruster technology you decide to use, this is so.  Your Maneuver
Drives produce so much thrust, and (for combat purposes) does so in
periods measured in hours or half-hours.  One G of thrust for an
hour equals 1 G-Hour. Clear so far?

 Most Maneuver Drives require something to spit out the back end of the
ship.  This reaction mass is also, for convenience, measured in G-Hours.
That way there is supposedly no confusion about how much fuel the ship
has available.  HEPlaR drives use reaction mass, as do Fusion Rockets.
Thruster Plates do NOT use reaction mass.  This usage of "G-Hours"
does not apply to Thruster Plates.

 So: Yes, a Thruster ship still accelerates using G-Hours of THRUST,
but requires no G-Hours of FUEL to do so (aside from what the power
plant is using).

Between watching Babalon 5, old episodes of Gundam Mobile Suit,
and just plain dreaming, I was trying to think of a way to design
an O\'Neill type colony using Traveller Starship construction
rules.
  
Megatraveller and CT had the Planatoid/Asteriod Hull type.  That
could be adapted to a space colony fairly easily.  This type of
construction seems to be missing in TNE.  I haven\'t tried to adapt
MT/CT rules to TNE yet.  Does anyone have any suggestions on
designing a space colony.  Orbital colonies don\'t seem to be a
part of the traveller universe and I really don\'t know why.
Especially in asteroids fields.
 
About as far as I got on a colony design was the size/volume.
Since you need a diameter of about 1.7km to get a rotation rate of
1 RPM to produce a centripetal acceleration of 9.8m/s^2, my basic
hull was a cylinder 1.7km in diameter and 5.2km long. Roughly
700 million displacement tons.  Add a fusion reactor an fuel for a
year, some storage space for supplies and you have a space colony.
  
My problem? What to use for the variables in the hull materials
table.  The colony still needs a hull AV of 30 to protect from
radiation.  Also, solar cells instead of fusion.  Why centripetal
acceleration for gravity instead of grav plates? In order to
reduce the energy required to power the colony.
  
Any thoughts? comments? suggestions?

I have always been attracted to traveller because of the background. It
is this attraction to the campaign background that I think generated so
much heated argument over the TNE background.

Well... when I first realized that GDW was killing the Imperium and much
of known space and history, I was shocked.  After a while though I\'ve
come to believe that the Imperium had to be killed.  

MT and CT has explained away much of the mystery of the ancients, and as
others have said, there were few frontiers.  The only really interesting
exploration seemed to be part of the Zhodhani core expiditions.  Of the
frontier and ancients mysteries, the ancients "history" particularly
bothered me.  Am I alone, or does the grandfather story sound lame?  I
never liked that story line, and it ruined the "ancient" mystery for me.

So, there was no mystery, and the imperium seemed impregnable.  They
intriduced the Rebellion to "liven" the setting up.  It was pretty
evident after a while that they were heading towards a dark age.  The
virus simply quickened things so they could start anew much sooner.  

With the TNE setting, the entire imperium is a mystery outside of the
Spinward Marches or whatever little pocket empire you use as your
setting.  We don\'t know what the jeck the black curtain is.  We don\'t
know what happened to the Solomani.  We don\'t really know what\'s going
on in the Aslan Hierate.  There is a lot of mystery out there, lots of
stuff to work with.  

While I have problems with timing (I don\'t buy some of the timing
elements associated with the spread of transponder technology necessary
for the virus to have spread; I also think the timeline should have been
advanced another 100 to 200 years to have allowed for more alien
cultures to have evolved in isolation) I think the background changes
offer greater potential for different types of adventure

I wonder if Project Longbow may be the reason they chose to advance
history to where they did.  Probably.  

Despite my timing reservations, and questions about the virus, I am glad
they restored mystery to the background.  I still have a strong love of
the old imperium, and I do think that the old background is useful for
planning a new era campaign.  It can be fun trying to figure out what
happened to various worlds.

What I DO get annoyed with is people who seem to forget that this is FICTION.
So what if Virus is scientifically impossible? JUMP DRIVES are impossible! The
damn thruster plates are impossible! All of the best science-fiction I\'ve ever
read was about PEOPLE, not things; things work just because they work.
   Also, a lot of people have been complaining that TNE is just T:2000 in space
and I submit that this has to do with emphasis placed by the players and the GM
in the campaign, In my campaign, the Star Vikings are an EXPLORATORY force.
They view themselves as descendants of the IISS. They are combat-trained, yes,
and they aren\'t afraid to use that training, especially when pursuing their
secondary goal of recovering lost technology, but reexploration and rediscovery
is the primary emphasis. My players don\'t even LIKE to use Fusion Guns-too
hard to use in close quarters. The favorite weapon is the ACR with DS ammo.
Keep in mind that some of these "low tech" worlds in the Wilds can be as high
as tl 8-10! Enemies can have some pretty effective weapons, and even spaceships
at those levels.
   I think the griping about the changes in the Traveller universe tech is
about 50% legit and 50% simple complaining by people who can\'t tolerate change.
I am annoyed with some of the rules glitches (and some things that aren\'t
glitches, such as firearms skills being based off STR and the autofire rules)
but I don\'t give a rip about changes to maneuver drives. Reactionless thusters,
HEPlar fusion drives...hell, I wouldn\'t careif they had to get out and PUSH if
it made a good story.
  All I know is that the New Era background lets me tell the kind of stories I
like to tell. That\'s why I like the background.

I have to admit that I have run only one TNE scenario and that\'s my experience
with Traveller so my opinions can\'t be based on first hand information. 
Based on that little information I have about CT has convinced me that it
is/was the best Traveller setting. In CT the Imperium is stable maybe slowly
expanding and there is lot of Hi-Tech in contrast to TNE where is lot to
expand and little Hi-Tech readily available.

IMHO the rebellion was GDW\'s worst mistake because it lead to the collapse as
an only "rational" way out. I believe that after the rebellion the Imperium
would have stayed dead and in place where Imperium were, there would have
been only a few independent states and no-man\'s land.

I have to admit that I run a Star Viking campaign but I *hope* that this is 
only a bridge to something greater. I keep thinking that because I doubt that
my players or me can find long-term fun from exploring and recontaction 
worlds. Maybe GDW publishes material conserning RC\'s "developed" planets.

    'body' => 'Background? Who needed a rebellion (or complete collapse) to give us the
background for _any_ adventure ever required?

Bored with high tech stuff?
 Force the players onto a lower tech world.
Want to show them how to rely on their own skills rather than technology?
 Crash the players\' (or someone else\'s) starship in the wilderness.
 Better still, massive engine failure leaves them drifting in space. Just
  how long will their oxygen last? Crash on an airless planet? There\'s no
  air out there and there\'s no flora and fauna to survive on. So who\'s
  volunteering their body as rations for the others?
 Even on an otherwise unadventurous exploration, if the party\'s native
  guide gets kille dor deliberately leaves them, just how well can they
  survive once left to their own devices? It only requires one bad roll to
  crash the party vehicle and damage the radio, or some other critical item
  upon which everyone was relying for rescue.

And lawlessness. Want to blow people away?
 What do you think low law level worlds are for?
 Even in our supposedly lawful society there are murders, gangland violence,
 drug dealing on the streets, mass political corruption, blackmail, fraud
  involving millions or billions of pounds (credits). You don\'t have to
 switch to a James Bond or Judge Dredd scenario to put some action into
 your games!

Don\'t like guns?
 The world is full of murders by strangulation, beating to death, knifings
 (with knives, razors, broken bottles, etc.). And then there\'s just plain
 beating up on people. High law world? Suddenly a pen-knife starts to seem
 like a good weapon? Got Unarmed Combat or Brawling? Suddenly all the gun-
 handlers are asking _you_ for protection against the nasty man in the
 alley who\'s got a baseball bat with nails stuck in it.
 i.e. You don\'t need guns to hurt/scare characters. And if they do need them
 to have a chance of winning, but you didn\'t let them take any on planet,
 then you can have lots of fun using Streetwise, etc. to find such weapons
 on the black market. Much more fun than walking down to the local hyper-
 market and stocking up on Uzi\'s.

Want a war?
 Okay, so the main planet is described as a boring peaceful high law-level
  world. But that only represents the majority. There will always be the
 Libyas, Iraqs, etc. and if that doesn\'t give some scope for military action
 then you need an upgrade kit for your imagination.

Still can\'t get away from the main world being boring?
 Got World Builder\'s Handbook or Scouts (Book 6)? What are all those other
 planets and asteroid belts doing in-system. Do you think the asteroid
 depot which serves as the local belter\'s R&R is going to be Law Level 9 just
 because the main planet is staffed by wimps? Even today (1994) we have
 certain relaxed laws for people in arduous tasks (oil rigs, etc.)
 And there\'s no reason why other planets in system can\'t be very different
  from the main world. Even colonies break away eventually (subtle US/UK
 joke :) - look no further for an excuse for a war of Independence).

And if your character\'s don\'t want to stick to the law, well they can bend
rather than break, steal by stealth rather than by force...

You don\'t need the rebellion or TNE hard times as background. The original
Imperium gave you plenty of scope for adventure, action, etc. I guess some
people just don\'t look hard enough...

Not that the better (I didn\'t say that so please don\'t bother to reply with
arguments, etc.) rules systems in MT and TNE aren\'t useful. I\'m just saying
that even a Law 9 Tech 15 place can have an awful lot of illegal activities
going on (just thought of another one - computer crime, c.f. Sneakers with
Robert Redford - now wouldn\'t that be a good way to scare the s!?t out of
your players...)

In answer, yes, lets have more background... I\'ve got complete written records
of every adventure I have run for my two Traveller groups, but they\'re a bit
big just to download and they don\'t include the referee\'s details of each
scenario. Perhaps some day I\'ll write another book about one [SUBTLE HINT,
I\'VE STILL NOT HEARD A PEEP OUT OF GDW].

The solution here is then not to dwell on being Star Vikings from ye Olde
Mudball worshipping a semi-sentient Air/raft but to dwell on being Regency
marines...or High tech dudes. 

The Virus so far has been seen as a destructive thing. Making people wary of
technology...with the viral mutations you can have your Blakes 7 ORAC only
smarter on board. Robots which are fully self aware. Technology designed by a
super advanced AI...

As for the gripes about FFS...and the guy who wanted a paintball gun
designed...

	What???

This is the old ....we have a doohickey to couple the vroodle but its easier
to do it by hand.  Just beacuse a supplement comes out..it doesnt stop you
from winging it..If a paintball gun mattered that much that i had to work out
muzzle velocities then I\'d wonder about the sort of game I was really playing.
I dont worry about the hows and whys other than  perhaps a
page of blurb for inquisitive players. In a world that has
Jump drives and Gravitics technology I don\'t think working
muzzle velocities to the third decimal place really satisfies
anyone. When I see a new ship I dont pay much attention to
details like G-Hours...I just wanna know how far the thing can
take us, how many of us can get in, how much cargo we can take
and does it have the safeguards to transport Powdered
Aluminium. 
Like Rodge said...when I think of TNE I think of wild-eyed
loners standing at the gates of oblivion who havent told their
parents what time they would be home for...

The rules system is a hell of a lot easier to manage than the
previous sets though Black/red Traveller still lingers in my
mind though the truth is I was using the TNE House system for
years with my traveller game.

The saddest thing about losing the Imperium is that NEWBIES
will not be able to get their mitts on the really old
stuff..the background that I loved. Snippets are fine but the
whole thing is much more satisfying. It\'s mostly gone now
though if sufficient interest were spouted I\'m sure someone if
no GDW would produce a background pack for the new era...just
for newbies who still want to play Pre-Collapse Revenants
which IMHO is one of the most fun roles to play..

I\'ve been quiet for a while on this list. This was because the
topics of discussion were basically "Tut Tut..GDW are so bad
cos they made a mistake on the third column, second row of the
hair colour table for the native inhabitants of a garden
planet..". I don\'t find this interesting. Sorry.

Wow!  Now that was a response.  I\'m pleased to discover so many folks who
are concerned with backround.  Thanks to everyone.  I\'ll get to specific
points in a moment but first I\'d like to let you know where I\'m coming
from.

I have been playing RPGs since the early days of D&D, probably since before
some of you were even born!  (Can it really have been that long?)  My first
RPG rules were those first three D&D booklets:

Book 1: "Characters and Com . . . , er, I mean "Men and Magic"
Book 2: "Starshi . . . , oops, it was "Monsters"
Book 3: "Wilderness Adven . . . , yikes, rather "Worlds and Adventures"

And then I bought the supplements as they came out, you know:

"Greyhawk" (or was it "Mercenary"?)
"Blackmoor" (or maybe "High Guard"?)
Etc.

You get the picture.  Then came the revised, full-size rule books for
"MegaDungeons . . . , er, I mean "Advanced Dungeons and Dragons".  And I
just had to buy everything: the three basic books, the "Monster Manual",
the "Deities and Demigods Cyclopedia", etc., etc.  And then came the new
magazine, "The Journal of the . . . , no, it was "Challenge . . . , nope,
I got it, "The Dragon".  Yeah, that\'s the ticket.

Early on my interest in sci-fi was piqued by my discovery of Traveller.
I bought the original booklets, the supplements, the additional booklets,
the adventures, the *Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society*, the double
adventures, etc., etc.  It was great!  I loved the richly detailed
background of the Imperium.  It had everything: bustling frontiers,
backwaters, decaying cores, alien realms, remote reaches . . . .

And then came that fateful day when the Emperor was assassinated (or was
he?).  MegaTraveller appeared and I was overcome with a sense of *deja vu*.
This had happened before.  Someone was reaching for my wallet again.  I had
a rebellion of my own - the only MegaTraveller item I bought was *The
Rebellion Sourcebook*.  In the words of an old sage, "Fool me once, shame
on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me!"  (In the years since then I\'ve come
into possession of second-hand copies of most MegaTraveller items.)

And then it happened again!  The "Rebellion" became "Hard Times" which
`evolved\' into "The Next Genera . . . , oops, into "The New Era".  (I seem to keep getting confused - all these RPG and sci-fi terms are so similar.  And
then, would you believe it?, Gary "Tolkein? Never heard of him!" Gygax shows
up at GDW.  But that couldn\'t have anything to do with all this, could it?)

Anyway, all good things must come to an end I guess.  I abandoned
`Imperial\' space altogether and have spent the last couple of years working
on a completely original Traveller campaign.

You may not believe me, but it was not my intention with my post to start a
b**ch session about TNE and to pine away for the `good old days\' of CT.  I
don\'t like what GDW\'s done, but it\'s their game and they can do with it as
they please.  I accept that.  (Then again, remember *New* Coke?  :-)  But
now, given that TNE is all that\'s being supported, I want to know what
there is to recommend TNE as a campaign background.  Several of you have
made some good points toward answering that question.  Let me get to them.

Hmmm, role-playing as "depressing".  Sounds like a post-holocaust game to
me, but "Twilight 2000" in space wouldn\'t be very original now, would it?

Hmmm, more post-holocaust - or `low-tech\' sci-fi?  Isn\'t that a
contradiction?

 
James Kundert <james@dumbcat.sf.ca.us> says:

Is this really the case?  Isn\'t it more accurate to say that TNE has more
variety than previous eras *within the same astrographic region*?  What
does TNE have to offer over the *real* frontiers of previous eras - those
regions beyond the settled areas of the Imperium and the other Major
States?

So did previous eras.

True, so now there is a *universal bad guy* (like D&D orcs or the Nazis
of Indiana Jones) for `hack-and-slashers\' to slaughter at will, but
is this an improvement?  Or is it even really very different?  I remember
some pretty virulent encounters with the `Zho dogs\' in the early CT days
before Norris `reprogrammed\' the Imperial (Deneb) propaganda machine once
the Rebellion forced him to realize there\'d be no Corridor Fleet to pull
his a** out of a Sixth Frontier War.

Again, so did previous eras, just not in the `developed\' sectors.

Not true, see above.  It seems from these points that TNE offers nothing
over the previous backgound except to make the `great unknown\' more
`accessible\' to `stay at homes\' that were unwilling to adventure out of the
settled regions of the Imperium.  What has really happened is merely that,
with TNE, GDW has expanded their *support* for this type of area - only the
way they\'ve chosen to do so has been at the *expense* of the established
areas of the campaign.  ("We had to destroy it to save it.").

What does the TNE background offer over a campaign booklet set in an area
coreward of the Vargr Extents, rimward of the Solomani Sphere, spinward of
the Hierate and Consulate, or trailward of the Hive?  IMHO, other than the
*deus ex machina* of the Virus, not much.  Are there other opinions?

A good description of the potential offered by TNE, but not all that
different in effect from that offered by a CT/MT "Core/Rim/Spin/Trailward
Sourcebook".

Again, the same would hold for a `frontier\' CT/MT campaign.

Hmmm, an interesting point but not one that I\'ve encountered.  I don\'t
quite see how the background itself would do this (take away or add
emphasis on character skills).  Isn\'t that more a function of `the rules\'
and referee interpretation?  I\'d like to hear more on this point.

And a `frontier\' sourcebook would have avoided this.

Well, this seems to be a rules-oriented point which, not having the TNE
rules, I can\'t comment on.  It would seem though that sophonts might be
able to effectively compensate for a lack of automation - Herbert\'s *Dune*
universe comes to mind as a good example.

So if I liked Twilight:2000 and wasn\'t creative enough to move it into
outer space myself I should buy TNE, right?

Yes, it would.  And an "After the Nth Stellar War" sourcebook (remember the
article "Prologue: Adventures in the Imperium\'s Past" from JTAS?)
would have done the same without condeming the entire Imperium universe to
destruction.  Of course, such a sourcebook wouldn\'t have kept us coming
back to the game store as easily to find out what was happening next in the
campaign.

I know I\'m sounding like a broken record, but a `frontier\' sourcebook
would have done the same.

How so?  What do you mean, specifically?  I assume you\'re not talking about
District 268, Trojan Reach, or the Far Frontiers?

Yes, except that TNE makes that all obsolete, but to what end?  What do I
get for throwing all that stuff in the trash?

Okay, old timers like me are idiots, but what about that makes the TNE
setting an improved campaign background?

Not much of a choice as I see it.  There\'s no equivalent to "Classic Coke"
being offered as far as I know.  At least, not yet.  :-)

Yup, I knew it.  And I didn\'t.  (I guess I could have done what Clayton
Williams, former Texas Republican gubernatorial hopeful, advised when faced
with a particularly abhorrent situation, "If it\'s inevitable, you might as
well lie back and enjoy it.")

I guess I\'m playing Anthony\'s tune.  So here\'s some late breaking news for
all you TNE-devotee\'s out there.  Have you heard about the latest upcoming
release from GDW for Traveller?  It\'s a completely new and improved
campaign background called "Dragonlance . . . , er, I mean "Brillant Lances
 . . . , no, wait, it\'s . . . well, we don\'t have a name for it yet, but
it\'s a great improvement over TNE, state-of-the-art in role-playing, etc.,
etc.

You\'ll get your turn.  Everyone\'s money\'s the same color.  And remember,
you heard it here first.  ;-)

Which seems like a good point to move this discussion forward.  So let\'s talk
about the current background.  I don\'t have TNE so I\'m not all that familiar
with it\'s setting.  I gather that the `Regency\' (same as the RCES?) is what
the Domain of Deneb has become with ruling authority held based upon some
claim to regency for the Third Imperium.  (Was that boy Avery involved?)  The
Hivers seem to have some sort of technological advantage.  (Didn\'t they help
create the damn Virus in the first place?)  What happend to the other Factions
 - all destroyed by the Virus?  And the major aliens?  So where are campaigns
taking place now?  All in the Regency?  (Gee, adventure and discovery in the
Spinward Marches.  Now isn\'t that original!)  I guess there are also these
Pocket Empires.  Little subsector-sized remnants of the `autonomous polities\'
that managed to survive the Rebellion, Hard Times, and the onslaught of the
Virus?  What do PCs do in TNE?  Lurch around in their jury-rigged starship
*Orcslayer* bashing vampire ships all day?  Do tell!

Thanks again to everyone for your honest participation.  I\'ve enjoyed this.
And please, don\'t anyone take offense.  My sarcasm is meant all in good fun.
I apologize if I\'ve offended any eyes.  Please let me know directly if you 
have a specific beef with something I\'ve said.  (Yes, even you Mr. Gygax.)

     I\'m afraid that you\'ve missed my central point.  You see, I want
the high technology to be *everywhere*.  To be *consistent*.  I want my
environment to be without low-tech places.  Back when I started playing
Traveller (14 years ago--where\'s my cane?), I created my own region of
space outside the Imperium where the absolute lowest tech level was 13,
and ranged as high as an extrapolated 17.  The average was right about
15.
 
     My main gripe with the new setting is that the *average* tech level
is far too low, and there are places that have no decent technology at
all.  It\'s not that there are too many low-tech worlds, it\'s that they
exist at all.  There should be *no* low technology at all.
 
     That\'s why I may use the new rules system (with the appropriate

Re: TML of 3/17...
Now that is what I call venting your spleen!

Several points in no particular order:

1)  The New Era has added no real frontier to Traveller.  Instead, it
has reduced a well populated and civilized area to relative barbarism.
The Imperium was spread over a few thousand star systems.  There are
*trillions* of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.  Traveller\'s Known Space
is pathetically small.  All that was necessary to add new frontier was
some \'beyond the Imperium\' source ideas, as was already pointed out by
someone else...  There was no lack of frontier, just a lack of people
generating their own sectors away from the main action.

2)  The New Era has less diversity than CT/MT.  Tech levels are more
uniform (and lower).  More worlds are balkanized.  Most have lower law
levels.  Many are now unpopulated.  In general, a subsector\'s worth of
New Era planets offers less diversity than an equal volume of CT/MT
worlds.

3)  The New Era or some other collapse-oriented scenario was hardly an
inevitable outcome of the Rebellion.  Did the US fall into a Dark Age
after the Civil War or the Assasination of Kennedy?  I, personally, was
looking forward to a \'balkanized\' Imperium, with Deneb, Antares, the
Vilani, the Solomani, et al becoming small, soveriegn, human-dominated
nations.  Many other outcomes were possible, none inevitable.

4)  Rules & Realism vs. \'True\' Role Playing -- This topic is a real candidate
for a flamewar, but I think that both sides are nearly equally important
to a good RPG.  Traveller has \'limped\' along for many years with, in
many ways, a very small rules set.  Although the design sequences for
Starships in High Guard may take a half-an-hour, combat can be picked up
in about a minute and the number of rules for design and combat
combined take up a 52 page book (with half-sized pages!).  Profit seems
to be the primary motive for the current volume of rules, although a sheer
love of tables and charts on the part of the writing staff undoubtedly
contributes.  I like a reasonably complex rules system.  Not overly
simplified, nor overly complex.  Likewise, I like a reasonably detailed
background, but not to the point that I have no room for personal
innovation.  Traveller, IMHO, has historically been good at providing
these qualities.  Simple, modularly expandable rules, with the large
political and historical details worked out.  A planet here or there
described in detail and the rest left up to the players.  I do not feel
that the current GDW products are providing the same sort of balance.

In conclusion, I quote the old adage, "If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it."
The Imperium was not broken.  At worst, it needed some tuning.  It is
now dead, and it deserved far better treatment from the GDW game design
group.  When Traveller was \'handed\' to them, so was a certain amount of
trust, which I feel has been betrayed.  Traveller:TNE seems much more a
hybrid of Twilight:2000 and 2300AD than it does a refurbished Traveller.
Making it Traveller instead of 2300AD:TNE or Twilight:5700 seems to have
gained GDW mostly the ill will of many established and dyed in the wool
Traveller afficionados.  The new people attracted to the game do not
appreciate the past history of the Imperium and would not miss it if it
were not there, while those of us who liked the Imperium feel it\'s loss
keenly.

In fact I think the rules of CT and MT did say in certain places that the
emphasis should be on people and the skills of people. One reason Trav\'s
computers have always have been Neanderthals is to avoid the "Star Trek
Computer" problem of the PC\'s saying "Computer, solve this incredibly
complex problem" and the computer replying "Sure, no problem". Maybe 
this is a rules point as well, but what is possible in a setting limits 
the adventures that may be run for it. TNE produces a situation where
there are (by logical deduction) far less safety features in equipment
than in the Imperium days. When a PC tries something dangerous there
probably won\'t be a fail-safe to bail her out of trouble. It will be
more dangerous than the pre-Imperium situation, but except for relics
this will just redefine the definitions of what is dangerous and what is
possible. Just think of all the computer-assisted equipment which has been
brain-damaged (ie virus-proofed) in the TNE setting, and it becomes clear
that a lot of previously routine tasks are so no longer. This means that
the players can be forced to do the work without depending on "toys",
and without having to carefully plot to make their technological "toys"
ineffective, as it is built into the background.

You are right in that this is a \'referee interpretation\' thing. It is all
very well saying that so-and-so makes PC\'s skills more important, but it
all depends on how the referee runs things. If the plot demands that the
PCs must do something, they will generally do it, regardless of 
consistency.

My above comment was exagerrating slightly. Traveller has historically 
jumped through hoops to outlaw automated starships. Starships had to
have a full crew to push buttons and be bored stiff for a week. Jump 
torpedoes disappeared, AI\'s were unstable (The Kinunir etc.). And now 
with the Virus we discover that starships can run themselves and maintain
themselves, but only if they are bloodthirsty maniacs.

This is a rules-and-technology oriented point, but one that annoyed one of
my players in a now-hibernating campaign. He was interested in starships
only as a means of transport, and resented the requirement of a full crew
a ship which should have been able to fly itself most of the time. For
other players, the starship was the only constant in the game, and they
wanted to know how the hunk of metal they were trusting their lives to
worked. Once this information is defined it does affect plots, and the
things the PC\'s attempt to do.

The *Dune* point is interesting - I would interpret Dune\'s technology as
being based on psionics and genetic engineering. This is a real shift
from the mainstream Imperium culture, and would involve an entirely
different mindset. It is an interesting idea for a culture with psionics
and psionic star travel that entirely abandoned computers (or perhaps it
subsequently developed psionic star travel).

	Absolutely.  However, the rules and such serve to shape the background. 
I cant play Star Trek using Traveller rules since the tech base is so

	Ok, here goes:
	Our campaign has been on hold for several months due to the fact that
one of our players has exercises the use of his masters degree to get a real
job.  Unfortunately, he\'s in New York (we\'re in Tennessee- the place the Virus
hit hardest).  With luck, he\'ll be back next week (spring break) and we\'ll
resolve his character out of the picture (he\'ll go home) and allow the rest of
the gang to continue.

	Cast of Characters ( and every one of them are, too :))

	Ahz Dueth: Self grandized Vargr captain. Owns 440 ton upgraded Vargr
 coursair.  Unfortunately, his original crew deserted him and he has been
reduced to the life of hioring *HUMANS* to crew his ship, and he\'s has to give
up some of his finer pleasures in life to carry cargo. Ugh. Decent pilot,
fairly good at the seedier skills (streetwise, etc).  Models himself on
old-Earth pirate documentaires, especiall "The Sea Hawk" and dresses the part. 
Has a gauss pistol shaped to look like a black-powder pistol.  Remember: he\'s
never been *convicted* of a crime ( something about lack of evidence, or
witnesses disappearing, or *something* like that...) Has started a collection
of 300,000 year old chicken bones (ancient artifacts) and wishs to posses the
last Harley-Davidson in existence (in the Terran Museum of Transportation
History on Luna)

   	Helen: An ex navy rating raised with Vargr.  She\'s from Corridor Sector
and her family worked in a small mining town owned mostly by Imperial Vargr. 
Their family was one of few living in a city full of Vargr.  Unfortunately, she
seems to think and act like a Vargr sometimes (like the night her and Ahz got
ahold of some Scout\'s Brew, decided to buy grav-bikes, cricket bats, and rotten
tomatoes and drive down the corridors of Aramis Upstation.  The local law was
NOT pleased, but since no-one was hurt, they merely had to pay damages and
clean up the rotten tomatoe sploches covering most of the main shopping levels.
 My players...:) )  She will be departing from the group sometime next week,
when she recieves a message from her brother.  She is also a follower of St.
Elvoos of Terra, the Bringer of Music and Celebration.

	Margareth : Ex Imperial Navy commander-intelligence.  Had long love
affair with a commanding officer who disappeared right after the 5th Frontier
War (don\'t tell her, but he\'s a deep cover spy working for the Zhodani...)  She
comes from a high-noble family on Trin, and has turned out to be quite the
black sheet of the family (something about her family religion- arranged
marriages, etc).  She once had a run in with the Ahz right after the 5FW, when
the light cruiser she commanded stumbled onto one of Ahz\'s *ahem* creative ways
of aquiring cargo.  High administration/command/computer skills, coupled with
high security clearence.

Marcus\' own 200 ton freigher is on lease to a subsector line based on Regina.

got tired of it, and decided to seek out adventure. (Actually, this is my NPC-

kind of turned on me.  I stopped playing her about 6 years ago when she
murdered her best friend (long story).  Since, she\'s become an NPC thorn in the
side of many planetary law enforcement agencies.  Currently, she is in a low
berth on the Vargrs ship until Ahz decides what they are going to do with
her(another long story...*sigh*...)

	Current time: 110-1116.  Place: Aramis/Aramis

	First adventure: What do you do when you stumble onto a Zhodani spy
ring?  Go looking for chicken bones?

	Ahz first totally Vargr-like act was this: through her family/military
connections, Margareth knows Norris (when she was little, her father was a good
friend of the Duke).  She called upon him for help/information during the
characters investigation of the Zho spy ring.  Norris gave some help and
information, but in exchange, he asked for the characters to deliver a secret
communique to the Imperial garrison on Esalin (the characters don\'t know
why...).  The Vargr, enthralled by the charisma of Norris, agreed to perform
the task.  On their second jump from Regina, the Vargr got ahold of a rumor of
300,000 year old chicken bones.  Since Norris was half-a-dozen parsecs away,
Ahz own thoughts kicked in, he decided the only thing asked of him was to
deliver the message, so he dumped the secret communique into the mail, and
changen course.  Instead of jumping for Esalin, they are heading somewhere
else.
	No one else knows  knows this yet...

	This campaign is centered aroung Margareth (although she doesnt know it
yet and her affair with her commander.  Eventually, they will find Margareths
lost love after a runin with Imperial Intelligence, the Ine Givar, the Vargr,
and the Aslan.  During the first chaotic years of the Rebellion and the unknown
war the Zhos are having on their spinward borders, a chance will be found to
rescue her love (she thinks he is working for Imperial Intelligence- she
suspected his psionic abilities during their affair...)  in a deep penetration
raid into Zhodani space. However, the rescue scene will be full of suprises... 
       When will all of this happen?  Well, the first pieces have already been
put into place (we\'ve played about five adventures so far, just barely
scratching the surface of the Zho spy ring), but its a very free form campaign. 
Most of the session start with me asking "OK, where are you going to go next?",
then I wing about 75% of it.  We\'re playing again next Wednesday (Happy, Happy!
Joy, Joy!)

I thought Grandfather was dumb too.  In fact the whole idea of the Ancients
was just too much of a gimmick for my tastes (like the Virus), but TNE
hasn\'t elimiated Ancient technology, although I guess we don\'t know yet
for certain how it has been affected by the Virus.  I guess the point is
there isn\'t anything about TNE that improves this situation (assuming you\'re
like Ron and me and feel it had some room for improvement).

There could have been *Imperial* Core Expeditions (possibly in cooperation
with the Zhos? Or maybe a `core race\'?), as well as Spin, Trail and Rim
Expeditions.  A Solomani Rebellion would have added just as much bloodshed
and mayhem as the Imperial Rebellion and might even have produced a more
sympathetic regime on the Homeworld of Humaniti (and weren\'t the Solomani
apparatchiks just the sort of *universal bad guys* that the Virus now is?).

This isn\'t `whining for the old days\'.  The point I\'m trying to make is that,
so far, *all* of the advantages claimed for TNE *from a background point of
view* could have been accomplished in the Imperium campaign.  Given this
fact(?), why should anyone buy TNE except that it\'s the only `game\' in town?
If the only car available was a Yugo would everyone not only rush out to buy
one but also be clamoring about how great it was?  (Again, this ignores
issues related to the rules system.)

I think it was established last night that the above is only relevant for
those who were unwilling to venture beyond the developed regions of the
Imperium.

If `out there\' means *only* Gushemege, Dagudashaag, Core, Zarushagar,
Ilelish, Diaspora, Daibei, and the rest of the developed regions of the
Old Imperium.

Okay, so `having no beef\' with something is a good enough reason to buy it?

The point about the attitudes of refs and players is an excellent one.
This is the first opinion I\'ve heard that has expressed something
other than the `post-holocaust\' attitude of TNE.  Maybe we\'re on to
something here.  But again, I must ask, what is `better\' about playing
the Star Vikings as descendants of the IISS than playing true Scouts on
an Imperial Core Expedition or some such thing?  Or if you don\'t like
the idea of TL15 explorers how about scouts from a smaller, lower TL
state somewhere on the frontier of the Imperium setting?  There was an
excellent article in *Gryphon* (I believe) several years ago in which
Mark Miller (we miss you) discussed an `ideal\' Traveller campaign
setting: a small federation somewhere beyond the fringes of the Imperium.
(And he didn\'t have to destroy the entire universe to find it!)

Another good point.  But change just for the sake of change (especially
when I have to get up off my wallet to do so) doesn\'t sound like such
a good thing to me.  That\'s why I\'ve posed the question "what about the
TNE setting is an improvement over previous eras?".

Here\'s an important point.  If you like the instability and unknown of TNE
you can have it on the frontiers of the Imperium campaign, but if you liked
the stability and civilization of the Imperium you\'re pretty much SOL in
TNE.  Choice?  Something for everyone?  Doesn\'t look like it.

So, if I\'m undestanding this point, that `something greater\' would be a
`stable, advanced\' region akin to the Old Imperium.  And if this is what
someone enjoys about Traveller then the place to find it in TNE is the
Regency.  So maybe TNE *does* still have something for everyone.  Maybe it
is *as good* as previous eras, but *better*?  No one\'s convinced me yet.

This is just Andy\'s conclusion.  He makes an excellent case in several
preceding paragraphs.  See last night\'s posting for the whole thing.

Maybe Rodge and Andy want to get together and set this up?

I won\'t speak for Brent, but the question for me is: "Is a new campaign
that creates `problems\' that need a `solution\' much of an improvement?".

Hey!  This is good!  I must admit I admire this sort of creativity.  (Even
if, ultimately, the idea of `good\' viral mutations is just another
gimmick like Ancients technology - and not much of a basis for an entire
campaign.)

Let\'s hope the marketing department at GDW is listening.  :-)
If they keep to their guns with `New Coke\' at least there\'s  still
hope for a `Classic Coke\' licensing argreement.

Okay, after two rounds, here\'s the score as I see it.  Not much to recommend
TNE over previous eras except that you don\'t have to venture outside the
core of the Old Imperium (which allows you to `rediscover\' worlds you were
familar with 70+ years ago) and the possibility of new `wonder gadgets\'
derived from positive viral mutations.

And of course we\'ve been ignoring one very important point.  It\'s much more
difficult for a game company to introduce a new product (you know, like
`new and improved Tide\') that\'s basically just a repackaging of an exisiting
rules system without some corresponding `improvement\' in the campaign
setting.  I realize that GDW is a business and thay have every right to
pursue their business interests as they see fit.  But I\'m a consumer and
I\'ve got my own interests - *and I\'d like to buy some new Traveller
products*!  But I\'m not going to buy anything they throw at me and so
far this is all TNE seems.  Is there anyone out there who would buy TNE
*for the background* (not the rules) if some sort of comparably priced
`Frontier Sourcebook\' was on the shelf next to it?  If so, tell us why.
And if you wouldn\'t buy TNE over this `Sourcebook\' but you bought
it because that\'s all there is, do you drive a Yugo?  :-)

Ding!  Ding!  Round 3!

	In an old Niven book, in the Known Space series, he described a 
rather neat idea for making large space colonies via rather low tech 
methods.  Get one very large chunk of aluminized mylar, form into a 
parabolic mirror, and attatch maneuvering devices.  Presto, one asteroid 
scale solar welder.  Use it to melt a large hole into the center of an 
asteroid (rock or iron based will work)  Allow to cool.  fill hole with 
water, weld another chunk of asteroid on top of the hole.  Now start the 
asteroid spinning, and heat evenly and gently.  Eventually the compressed 
steam form the water will puff the mostly molten asteroid out like a 
balloon.  Instant large, centrifugally stable, hollow structure.  
Probably only need a few thousand or so patches and it\'ll be air tight.

	All you have to do is spin it slowly enough that the surface 
tension and viscosity of the molten rock/metal of the asteroid is enough 
to counteract the effects of rotation, so you don\'t have blobs flying off 
toward\'s your (really) fragile mirror.  

	Yes, I know, there\'s probably a million reasons you minutiae
freaks out there (and you know who you are ;-) could find to give me why
this wouldn\'t work, but, what the hey, they use FTL don\'t they?

	Besides, asteroids are cheap, you could have lots to practice on!

Hi All,

I\'d like to comment on the TNE vs. CT/MT backgrounds postings.

While I agree that the official campaign needed change, the rebellion
certainly provided it. I think a very interesting history could have
come out of the rebuilding and reforming of the various post-rebellion
factions. There would be lots of political intrigue and conflict as 
the powers worked out their roles. The resulting map would be more
interesting than either the Third Imperium or The New Era.
It would have been much more believable although not as cataclysmic.

The most dramatic traveller event for me was the outbreak of the 
fifth frontier war. The assassination of Strephon and the resulting
rebellion were interesting. The announcement of the virus made me 
sick to the stomach. It was too depressing.

And something like a "baddies from the core" plot device could even 
have brought former enemies together for survival. That would have made 
the rebellion fade by comparison and redeem the participants. Plus, it 
would add much more mystery and discovery than the virus. Who are the
baddies, where have they come from, etc. But, that is all only what 
could have been.

I just hope that Longbow will hasten cleaning up this virus mess so 
we can get back to good wholesome exploration and away from tomb
robbing. 

Why 70 years and not 150-300 years lost between MT and TNE?
We still have to resolve Lucan and the black curtain. You can\'t leave a
lead like that around and not follow up. Besides, he\'s the one that
started this virus mess. Someone is ought to pay for this. And you 
have to let gamers bring their charcters over from MT if you want 
to capitalize on past sales.

Personally, I wish they had moved the TNE setting to 250 years after 
the rebellion. By that time technology and culture would have changed
enough that we wouldn\'t be making as many complaints about rules and
equipment incompatabilities.

As far as I am concerned the TNE background has next to nothing to
offer me. I hope that will change.

After posting that rather loud message on adventuring, I thought I
better put my money where my mouth is.
 
So, here is something I\'ve tried out recently on the hapless
victims I lure -- uh, er -- imaginative players I invite to my
house every Saturday night.
 
 
 
 
                   ----
                   LET\'S GO OUT TO THE MOVIES
                   ----
 
So far, I\'ve sprung 3 movie-based scenarios on my players.  Here
is one of them...
 
 
 
 
                    THEY CAME FROM BEYOND
                    ----
 
 
(inspired by INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS)
 
Junidy/Aramis/Spinward Marches, backdated to the year 1053, was
the location of this scenario.  I\'ve embellished the story as
enacted by myself and my players for the sake of reading
enjoyability.  However, the plot-line is essentially the same as
the way it unfolded during our playing session.
 
 
The player characters were:
 
       James L. Tiberius, an ex-cop,
       Baraka "Bugeyes" Lews, his informant,
       Arthur Lawrence Cage, an ex-marine visiting his old friend James.
 
 
World Background:
 
Excerpts from IISS survey records, on file at Junidy Down
Starport, 205/1105:
 
Junidy/Aramis/Spinward Marches (B434ABD-9 S) -- Junidy is a
showcase of the adaptability of sophonts.  It is but a small
world, with an atmosphere too thin to support most life, yet it
is home to more than 28 billion citizens.  Two species of
intelligent being make Junidy their home: Humans, and
Llellewyloly, dividing the world\'s population roughly in half
between them.
 
Llillewyloly are quintupedal (i.e., they have 5 legs), each leg
ending in a tripod of digits.  The being\'s legs protrude from its
central hairy body which resembles a big fuzz-ball or the blossom
of a dandelion gone to seed.  Their resemblance to the weed of
Earth-origin is made complete when they stand on a single leg and
fold their remaining legs up under their bodies, flamingo-style.
This is the posture they take when sleeping; it is an evolved
behavioral trait adapted for heat conservation.  Because of their
appearance, the humans of Junidy often call them "dandies" and
"daddy long-legs".  The llellewyloly resent the nicknames, and
regard them as vulgar racial slurs.
 
A llillewyloly\'s toes serve equally well as fingers, being only
slightly more awkward than a human\'s manipulators due to their
large size, but making up for it in finesse granted to it by
virtue of having its visual and audio sensory organs in its
stalks and fingers.
 
Llellewyloly (pronounced "yeah-yeah-wee-lolly") are fully adapted
to Junidy\'s sparse atmosphere, unlike their human counterparts,
who must live in pressurized habitats and use air compressors to
breath outdoors or else quickly suffocate to death.
 
The cities of Junidy provide the primary shelter for the humans
of the world, while most but not all llelleweloly live out in the
country.
 
Junidy is within but a hex or two of the Imperium\'s coreward
border.  It is often visited by trade enclaves and merchants from
the Vargr Extents from beyond the border, and is a thriving
trading center.  Vargr visitors are often seen wandering the
streets, and many of them have actually made Junidy their home.
 
 
For backdating purposes, as of the year 1053, I estimate the
world\'s population to have been approximately 18 billion, and its
tech level at about 8 in most areas.
 
 
 
 
The Adventure:
 
Baraka slammed his bony fist down onto his apartment\'s control
console.  None of his llellewyloly contacts were responding to
his comcalls today, not a single one.  It was like all the
"dandies" just left town or something.
 
It was funny how much information he got from the stringy
quintuped natives of Junidy.  The humans of the world often
disregarded the alien sophonts as they spoke to one another. They
were too bizarre-looking to be intelligent, but they were.  They
may have looked like big dandilions when in their typical
flamingo stance, but they were as intelligent as humans, some
even more so.  Baraka pursed his lips tight in frustration.  No
tips, no dough.  It\'s how he made his living. He was an
informant.  A street rat.
 
Baraka lived in the Astoria Whaldorf, a run down housing complex
on the edge of the commercial district.  He was home all alone,
and was not enjoying himself.
 
The irritating grating sound of the door buzzer broke the
silence.  Baraka reflexively flipped the com switch on the control
panel before him, and blurted involuntarily "Who is it?"  A rough
monotone voice replied "Big Eddy sent us."
 
Big Eddy was a local crime lord, his men regulary shook down
businesses from Main Street to the Turban Desert Turnpike. Baraka
was in near panic.  This couldn\'t be!  For probably the first
time in his life, he didn\'t owe anybody anything, so he had no
idea why Eddy\'s men were there, unless he had blown his cover.
He protested, "I paid him off last week!"   The vaguely strange
monotone replied through the com, "Big Eddy wants to see you."  A
chill went down Baraka\'s spine, and his body started to shake.
He didn\'t want to die.
 
With the fight-or-flight response twisting his gut into knots,
Eddy stumbled across his apartment and retrieved his body pistol
from its hiding place in the wall vent in his bedroom, and put it
in the utility pouch at his waist.  He left the pouch unzipped.
After turning up the thermal control on his jumpsuit, still
shivering he walked over to his apartment\'s control console and
pushed the "open" button sitting next to the master door switch.
This might be about nothing, and he\'d be suspect for sure if he
didn\'t let them in.  Then again, even if this was it, and he kept
them locked out, they could simply cut their way in with laser
drills and then torture him all the worse for resisting.  Better
that he talk his way out of this one.  He\'d done it before, and
he could do it again.  Baraka was as slippery as they came.
 
The doors slid apart and two burly men walked in, dressed in the
planet\'s customary one-piece jump suits.  Baraka picked up a
printout on kluupa racing odds laying next to the console, forced
a smile, and walked halfway across the room to greet his
unexpected and unwanted guests.
 
"Come with us, Big Eddy wants to see you", said the bigger of the
two men.  Baraka\'s heart pounded.  This was bad, a standoff may
have been better.  More often than not, people who were brought
before the boss were never seen again.  Baraka noticed they were
not hoisting laser drills.  He grimmaced slightly.  The escorts\'
faces were expressionless, their blank stares seemed to pierce
right through him.  Trying to act casual and unconcerned, Baraka
answered "Oh yeah, what about?"  He failed miserably in masking
his nervousness, but his guests didn\'t seem notice.  He started
spasmodically flipping through the reams of data he was holding
as if it actually interested him.
 
A moment of silence went by, and then the apparent leader of the
duo responded in an almost computer-like voice, "He has some
questions to ask you."  Baraka looked up briefly, and became
accutely aware of the size differential between these two men and
himself -- they were nearly twice his size.  His nose darted back
down into the printout.  "Questions?" he queried, "What
questions?"
 
The monitone resumed.  "He didn\'t tell us.  And we don\'t want to
keep Big Eddy waiting."  Baraka\'s thoughts raced.  He wondered
why Eddy was called "Big" in the first place, the man was only a
4\'2" shrimp!  The grunt Baraka had been quibbling with took a
step forward, his right hand extended forth.  "Come."  Seeing no
other way out of this situation, Baraka agreed to go, "Sure I\'ll
go, I\'ve been meaning to pay Big Eddy a visit anyways."
 
He stepped forward, looked up, and handed the man his printout.
"Do you like pornographic novels?  Well this one is a real
teaser!"  While the man was momentarily distracted by the document
now in his hand, Baraka\'s free hand darted down into his open
utility pouch, and then with body pistol firmly fisted, it darted
back out and up to beneath the chin of the silent one of the two
grunts, and blew his brains out.  Having built-in silencing
capability, the compact ppz24 plastic pistol barely made a sound.
It would hardly have mattered though, as each apartment in the
building was nearly sound-proof.
 
Adrenaline surging within him, Baraka twitched around before his
slain enemy had even hit the floor, and as he fearfully backed
away to take aim at his other would-be nemesis, he hardly noticed
the green splatters on his gun and hand.  His printout fell to
the floor as the remaining brute lunged forth to grab him.  As
combat-inexperienced as Baraka was, battle-shock had not yet set in,
it all was happening so quickly.  But he had actually killed a
man.  His first kill.  Skipping backwards, Baraka fired away again
and again into the big man\'s chest, exclaiming, "Die, you son of
a Vargr whore!" just as he had seen in the movies.  And to his
utter amazement, just like would happen in a movie, green fluid
flowed down the front of the man\'s jump suit, and he kept coming.
 
Bewildered, Baraka skipped back and around the end of his sofa,
and darted for his bedroom, aiming and firing his gun behind him.
He hit his assailant at least three more times.  It stopped
momentarily, so Baraka did likewise and braced himself as he
continued shooting at it.  It wouldn\'t go down, and just stared
right at him as he fired into it.  Its eyes revealed a slight
glint of green.  Then the creature in human\'s clothing came for
him again, and it started to scream.
 
The shriek it made was like a dozen sirens sounding
simultaneously, each one a steady monotone on its own, but
combined they were a polyphonic nightmare, a cacaphony worse than
a thousand fingernails being pulled across a screaching
blackboard.
 
The sound pierced Baraka\'s mind.  He couldn\'t stand the terror of
it, it was driving him insane with fear.  The sound was
unbearable, the wail of a creature that wouldn\'t die.  The sound
of death, and it was almost on him.  He tried to dart backwards
as he shot, his now empty pistol clicking as he slammed into and
fell back onto his bed.  Down upon him the roaring thing came.
 
Baraka screamed as the mindless terror grabbed at him.  He rolled
to one side and off the bed just as the creature tore at where he
was a second before.  The snitch scrambled to his feet and dodged
to one side as the thing came at him again.  Like the lowest of
animals, he struggled to survive.  He jumped up onto the bed and
off the other side, and as the deadly beast tried to follow,
Baraka raced back out of the bedroom.  He leaped over the couch,
raced past the corpse on the floor, and lunged at the panel
switch next to his front door.  The screaming stopped.
 
Baraka slammed his fist into the panel next to the gate which was
his freedom from death.  He lunged into the widening crack as the
doors started to part, a huge feeling of relief sweeping through
him as he did, but slammed into them as they suddenly stopped and
closed once again.  Abject terror gripped him.  In a state of
panic-verging horror, he swung wildly around to spot the creature
before it could get at him.   The inhuman monster that still
looked vaguely human was standing quietly at the apartment\'s
control console, staring at him.  Its hand was pulling away from
the apartment\'s master door switch.
 
Baraka\'s eyes filled with tears.  It wasn\'t mindless.  It was an
intelligent fiend.  And he was trapped in here with it, his gun
out of bullets.  Intense panic gripped him.  He never new what
hell was like until now.  He knew he was going to die.  The alien
approached.

  I am a recently revived Traveller player throwing together a campaign for
some Traveller virgins, I am at a quandry.  In the \'old days\' I played 
Classic Traveller (I guess), the 3+ books in a nice little black box.  This
suited myself and my players fine. In 1987, however, I began a role-playing
hibernation that I am just now being awoken from.  In that period, a dear 
friend gave me the entire MegaTraveller set (and about every other product
GDW had at the time) which I thanked him for and buried in a closet.  Now to
my dilemma: I dearly loved the CT rules, and the MT rules are fine (for
experienced players. Let\'s face it, in these books tables and charts 
outnumbered grammaticaly written text 3 to 1.)  I am unsure of the qualities
of GDW\'s latest incarnations of Traveller.  Is there any current set of rules
that is somewhere in between the simplicity of CT and the complexity of MT?
I know that I can disregard any rules I think are too complex, but it\'s hard
explaining to players why I don\'t allow the 20 different sizes of mortars that
the rulebook includes and they want.  As far as background and \'richly detailed\'settings go, I tend to design my own little sector outside the realm of imperialspace.  So (after all that rambling), what rules system is detailed enough but
not overpowering?

I\'m not sure I follow how having high technology everywhere is consistent. If we
look at the real world we live in, it certainly is not consistent.  It is not
consistent even within a single nation.  
 

While the "favourite" campaign universe of any referee is of course a matter of
preference, I don\'t think that having _consistently_ high tech levels for every
world really makes a lot of sense.  The Imperium always struck me as permitting
a lot of variety within its borders, so technology would vary from world to
world, and possibly philosophies towards technology could vary as well.
 
If we look at our real world, some nations primary exports are fairly "low
tech", and they often get locked in a dependency relationship by trading the low
tech raw materials for higher tech finished industrial goods.  I don\'t see why
similar situations could not arise in the imperium of old.  It only seems
realistic.
 
One could really have fun playing with these types of economies, as players are
recruited by persons working for a mega-corporation sent to destabilize a world
government that was trying to impose restrictions on trade in an effort to
"industrialize" or "post industrialize" or whatever.  Or they could be hired by
people from the other side to check out certain activities of mega-corporations.
 
In addition, the single tech level listing for a world or culture could be
misleading.  Some cultures could specialize in certain areas, and be say tech
level 13 in terms of bio-engineering, while only tech level 8 in other areas.
 
Finally, the tech level on a world isn\'t the maximum tech level for that world. 
It is just a general rating.  There can be wealthy individuals, imperial
representatives, or whatnot who have all the high tech you want.
 
Of course, none of this addresses your concern of just having everything _high
tech_.  I favour greater diversity as it seems to be more plausible given the
nature of the Imperium and known space.

True.  But I doubt there would be much new "life" going towards core, or if
there was, it would be very different from any life forms we know of.  Although
not an astrophysicist, I\'ve read many times that the stars and matter as you
move close to core generally have fewer of the heavier elements, and some of the
key building blocks for life as we know it.  Still, if there was life there, it
would probably be very interesting.  That still leaves room for going the other
way.  However, the Imperium was pretty much hemmed in on all sides and wasn\'t
going anywhere, unless via some agreement with their neighbours. 
 
While the referee was free to be as creative as they wished in creating a
"frontier", there wasn\'t really one presented.  That I think is the difference. 
TNE turned everything in known space into a lawless frontier except for a few
pockets, some large. 

 
I must note that I do see one major problem with the TNE setting.  There is a
huge danger of, as others have pointed out, of being turned into a "swords and
spaceships" type of affair, or Twilight 2000 or whatnot.

True.  I would agree that in terms of "ratings" the planets are less diverse.  I

do think though that they do present greater opportunities to surprise the
players.  How would a planet change in the fall?  Before, you could often
consult a compute library and get a good idea of what you were always heading
into.  Now you can consult the records and find what it used to be like.
 
You are right though, there is less diversity when you look at the raw
statistics.  However, as you mentioned in point 1, any referee is capable of
making things pretty diverse.

The assasination of Kennedy was not the same type of event.  I would say it was
more along the lines of the death of Tito in Yugoslavia or some other large
confederation/empire with very different ethnic/cultural groups being held
together by a strong leader/noble class.  I\'d say that events in Yugoslavia and
the Soviet Union may be a bit more analogous to what was happening in the
Imperium.
 
I do agree though that a collapse into barbarity was not inevitable.  I
personally think it probably would have gone the way you suggested in part. 
However, worlds on the battle lines would be destroyed and would effectively be
blasted into the dark ages.  We would have Beruits, Stalingrads and Sarajevos
galore.  
 
Who knows what effect the collapse in large scale trade could have had.  I\'m not
sure how self sufficient many of the systems in the imperium were.  With trade
gone, they could possibly have faced very restless populations.  I think the
results would have been a lot of instability, with a general falling back in
terms of overall "tech", although there would still be a few places that
remained high tech.
 
When I spoke of "inevitable", I refer to the realization that the Imperium can
never be again, at least not in the next several hundred years.  When the
Rebellion started, I convinced myself that Margaret would likely succeed. 
Eventually though, it became apparent that GDW had it out for her, and I didn\'t
see any other faction as having much of a chance.  Then came hard times and the
collapse of many worlds.  It looked like it was going to grind on for a long
time this way.  I think the Virus was GDW\'s way "out" of this.  With the virus,
they were able to clear off the table much more quickly to rebuild anew.  
 
In many ways, I kind of wish they had gone with the fragmentation and general
lower level of the "dying back of technology", but I do like some of the
possibilities of the virus created vampires.  I also like the possibility of
developing some very different cultures and worlds within the old territory of
the imperium.

I would have to agree.  The rebellion did provide change.  It was starting to
get rather depressing watching things go so badly for humaniti.  Perhaps they
could have just zoomed us ahead x number of years to after the worst of it. 
But we do have the TNE setting, and it\'s too late to change that official
history.  Although at first I was very skeptical, I can live with the TNE
setting.  I actually like it, despite agreeing that it could possibly have been
better done otherwise.

Perhaps GDW could be kind enough to support the TNE rules in all eras?  I think
that a lot of the older fans might like that.  Brilliant Lances did have some
pre TNE time period scenarios in it.  With a timeline stretching over so many
years, it would be a shame to let all the older history and potential for
adventure to be unsupported.

You are right.  TNE does not change Grandfather, but at least it allows us to
have other more obvious mysteries to inspire adventure.  Yes, any ref could come
up with his own "mystery", but now it has been returned within the official
setting that has been developed.
 
In a related issue, I suspect that the ancients were simply a way to help
justify humaniti and other human type creatures being all over known space. 
There are also a lot of people who like science fiction that deals with ancient
mysterious civilizations.

Ummm.. the only car in town still remains a good argument. The only car in town
may be a yugo, but in many ways it is better than the old imperial chevy which

Heh.  That\'s one of the biggest mysteries in the TNE.  Pick up a copy of TNE or
Survival Margin and look at the maps.  In the most recent map is a big area
around where core is which is a big black splotch through which no information
passes.  There are also the rumours of vampire fleets around the edge of this
curtain.  What is behind the curtain?  Lucan?  A virus-based AI empire?  A huge
vampire fleet that thinks it is Lucan?  The books are rather vague about it so
far.

I would say that TNE is a bit less stagnant than CT.  MT wasn\'t stagnant by any
means, but things were slowly going downhill as imperial civilization slowly
devoured itself.  Eventually, the fighting would break down, as it was starting
to, and you would have had large areas of collapsed economies and worlds along
the battle lines, and different things happening in the worlds behind the lines
which still may be stable.  This could have been the setting for TNE.  One of
many possibilities.  I would have guessed that the Solomani would have been the
biggest winners overall, their expansion stopping only because of difficulty in
absorbing hostile worlds.
 
On the plus side, I would say TNE offers:
(1) Less certainty for the players because old imperial space is less stable
(2) The chance to develop very different societies as a result of distrust of
technology
(3) The chance for the players to engage in empire building/civilization at a
much more personal level.  Their actions can have more of an effect because of
the smaller scale of the situations they are likely to be in
(4) Greater freedom within imperial space to develop worlds, cultures, empires.
(5) The chance to do some fun things with the virus gimmick as others have said
 
On the downside:
(1) Trade outside of the spinward marches is a very different animal.  I was
always a big fan of the old long trade oriented far trader campaigns.  Although
the current setup could still see trade, but it would be on a barter type of
system, and one would have to be very careful of losing ones ship to the
"natives"
(2) The virus has a lot of problems, both in terms of planning and plausibility.
(3) There is a danger of creating a D&D dungeon-crawl type of setting with the
Star Vikings as they plunder technology in their snatch \'n grabs.  
(4) TNE is an attempt at a darker setting.  GDW is jumping on the darker setting
trend in games.  It remains to be seen if the supplements offer something for
those who prefer a more stable and optimistic future.
 
Lots more pros and cons, I\'m sure.  I\'m just two tired to think of any right
now, and this letter is already too long.  
 
Overall, I think that the TNE does offer greater alternatives to the referee
than it destroyed.  The regency still does exist for those who want greater
stability.  The wilds exist for those who like that type of campaign.  Within
the pocket empires, hiver\'s sphere, regency, etc the referee is of course the
final determinant as to what their campaign will be like. 
 
I used to really dislike the whole virus idea, and the new setting.  I still
like the old setting, but if I were to run a campaign now, I would definitely

opt for the New era, or maybe a combination of MT/New Era to work _sleeper_
players into the post-virus era.  I personally find it fascinating to think of
how societies would rebuild from this disaster.

I liked it.  It has 154 pages, 19 World Maps, Full Data on six 
subsectors, five of which are totally new.  It also outlines possible 
adventures on the 19 given worlds.  The material is presented as the Area 
of Operations for the RCES for the next few years with each "target" 
given a priority, fleshed out with a few possible adventures on each 
planet, and plenty of room for a GM to build upon.  In past products GDW 
would give a ref a foundation to build on but the GM had to do everything 
else or they would have a series of modules that step by step would give 
you enough detail to make a rich campaign world.  PATH OF TEARS is an 
excellent compromise between these two philosophies.  This time there is 
both a foundation AND a blueprint.  There is a great deal of background 
material about the Reformation Coaltition including:  the names of all the 
memebers, "typical" viewpoints of Reformers from various Coalition 
worlds, the names of their ships, more detail on the Clipper ships, some 
equipment (including the 14.5mm ATR ).

A good product.  The maps alone are worth the $18.00

     It\'s *deliberately* consistent.  My created area is far outside the
(still thriving, mind) Third Imperium, and they do things a little bit
differently.  For example, how do you start a colony?  Do you dump a
bunch of people and some supplies on a planet and more-or-less leave the
new colonists to fend for themselves (Third Imperium model), or do you
send in a crew of professional construction and infrastructure engineers
who build everything that is needed for colonization in advance
(automated production facilities, housing, amenities, etc.) so that the
colonists can just move from their old world to their new one and pick
up their lives where they left off (my model).  Basically, the people in
my world *work* at making their technology as uniform and consistent as
possible from world to world.  That way, you can go from world to world
within the area and *depend* on being able to get expert and correct
repairs for your starship, no matter what port you come to (like, even
before the colonists arrive, there\'s at *least* a B class starport in
place, waiting for their landing).  You don\'t *ever* have to get your
hands dirty with low tech.
 
 >The Imperium always struck me as permitting a lot of variety within

     The Imperium did--I don\'t.  Which is why the New Era background is
a giant step backward from my viewpoint.  The general trend of
technology should be *up*, not catastrophically down.  Not to mention
the fact that the development and advance of technology should have the
semiconductor technology that the Cymbeline chips (and, presumably,
their Deyo descendants) far enough behind in technical history that
current Imperial technology should be utterly immune to any invasion of
that type.  In other words, the Virus should be impossible--another of
the reasons it\'ll never get anywhere near my game.

     Mmm.  Unfortunately, where I come from, diversity is A Bad Thing.
Certainly something to be avoided.  I prefer a world that is placid and
predictable.  Easier on the cardiac stress level.  Of course, when a
curve is thrown, trouble-shooting becomes necessary.

GDW changed a LOT of minutiae in the MT-TNE switch.  Since each of these
changes impinge on some aspect of someone\'s campaign, they come up for a
lot of discussion.  Also, you need a much wider sample.  Since all we had
to discuss most of last year was the background, it was talked to death
then.  All the discussion (nor any of the discussion here while TNE came 
out) had much effect on GDW.  BL and FF&S came out this year, bringing
lots of minutiae to discuss.  Including how to get BL, FF&S, and TNE to
jibe.  Or how to get TNE to feel like CT or MT.

It\'s like having to cross a field freshly used by cattle - there\'s no 
clean way across.


He further asks:
>is there to recommend TNE (vs. MT or CT) from a `background\' point of
>view?  Forget the new rules and such, is the new campaign an improvement
>over the ante-Rebellion, Rebellion and Hard Times eras? 

No. (IMHO.)
It offers too much that makes no sense, and offers much less than say CT
offered.  Or MT, for that matter (though I thought the Rebellion was pretty
stupid as a marketting ploy; GDW apparently felt different).

1. Virus makes no sense.  
   - From a story telling viewpoint, it was not necessary (Hard Times was 
     enough to kill of any siable chunks of the Imperium).
   - The ship identifiers make no sense.  Too much of the devastated area 
     is filled with ships that would not have needed or wanted them - 
     including a good number of vessels within the Imperium.  As
     described, they are too easy to fool (TL7 comps can do a good job at
     fooling humans as to what they are; TL14s should have no problem 
     folling the chips which are not as smart.  So, bye-bye vector.
   - "Duh, the siftware reburns the chips" and "duh, the chips move 
     themselves from computer to computer" are the lamest excuses I have
     ever heard; beyond my suspended belief.  Want to kill the Virus? Use
     a good magnet.
   - Actually, i can go on for several pages describing what\'s wrong with
     the Virus (all of which i do not like), but it has been done before
     and been done better, so I\'ll spare you all that.

2. Given the Virus, the Regency\'s existence makes no sense.
    - There were not enough military ships to fully cover a perimeter 
      six parsecs deep thick enough to stop EVERY ship that came in.
      unless they pulled back to something one quarter the size of the
      Domain of Deneb.  In such a case, of course, the Virus would have
      swept around the shrunken Domain and killed off the neighbors.
    - If they did not do so, then Regency history should include the
      planets they had to sterilize in order to save the Regency.
      (Norris\'s press agent annouces a permanent end to the Efate 
      Rebellion... :-)
    - The Virus would have swept north around teh Vargr Extents and into
      Zho space and then hit the Regency from the other side.
    - The Zho have no reason not to sweep over the Regency and show the
      poor humans there a "Better Way of Life."  That certainly fits the
      character of the Zho GDW so carefully crafted and they certainly 
      have the resources now (not to mention a whole bunch of the Deneb
      military is out guarding against Vampires.)
    - Someone here had suggested that the quarantine line is not as tight
      as it appears, allowing smugglers in and out at will; if it is not,
      "airtight" the Virus would have leaked in, so by-bye Regency.  If it
      is airtight, they waste a LOT of economic resources by destroying 
      incoming ships rather than cleaning them.

3. RCES campaigns seem designed to turn the PCs into cynical fascisti.  Or
   mutineers.  "OK, lads, we\'re going to go and remove the obstacles near 
   the last working fusion plant on this planet so it can be used by our
   Corporate sponsors on Aubaine.  Intel reports that none of the obstacles
   has anything worse than an LMG..."  Seriously folks, raiding ailing 
   planets to take away assets to your own ailing planet doesn\'t have much
   in common with some of the CT adventures I enjoyed so much.  From the 
   descriptions of the planets that make up RCES, these folks ain\'t about to 
   save any minor (much less major) chunk of universe anytime soon - nor 
   support the military machine big enough to dominate it!

   RCES seem to me to make much better bad guys than good guys. While it 
   makes an interesting change to play bad guys once in a while, it is not
   a good campaign basis (IMHO).

4. The large empty spaces.... Consider the billions of programmers in known
   (Impie + Solomani + K\'Kree + Aslan + Vargr + Zho + Hiver + many, many 
   minors) - No one found a cure for the Virus?  Ridiculous.
   What of all those TL7 worlds with hardcopy libraries of imperial tech?
   Too easy to have not fallen.  Blank space should not be there.

   However, that said, the best hope I can see for a capaign that would
   interest me is a pocket campaign, or to wander on one of those few 
   surviving interstellar traders.

5. Given the Virus + Hard times crash as described, 70 years is about 100
   to 200 years too soon to position TNE. (That\'s something else I can 
   lecture on for several pages but I\'ll spare you; its been done better
   elsewhere).

6. If this was a new game set in an unrelated universe (as Traveller:2300
   was), I\'d probably like it much more.  However, for something related to
   Traveller, I find the disconnects both in the background and in teh rules
   too severe.  I know you wanted to limit the discussion to rules only, but
   some of teh rule changes have severe effects on the feel of the game.
   Ships handle MUCH differently - in all too many cases, a same ship has
   gone through some radical shape changes.  

Now, while my original Traveller campign took place in a universe of my own
devising and while I could easily enough change the rules to TNE and re-use
that universe, your question was "how does this background compare"

Beyond my general bitching (items I can\'t swallow, above), I find TNE FAR
more limited.  In CT (or even MT, away from teh rebellion), you could select a 
variety of settings for the SAME campaign.  Go to the Imperial edges for a
while, trade, get involved in a brushfire war, come back within the imperium
for some more civilized adventures, brush shoulders with some high mucketies
for some intrigue adventures - rather wide choice.  Now you are forced to
choose ONE or TWO basic styles and shift between them.  The places where the
styles can mix are too wide apart:

You can be raiders/commando for RCES (I presume there will be wrangling
within RCES govt)
	OR
You can be traders within the Regency (or adventures on civilized planets,
but if you want that, why not just stay with CT?)
	OR
Traders outside the regency (If you leave you can\'t really go back)
        OR
Start as barbarians and re-learn what technology is
        OR
Start within an expanding pcoket universe - BUT that will last only until
GDW chooses to trod over your work (pick an area out by the edge; you\'ll 
last longer).

I see a lot of OR, but very little AND.

I will state for the record that I generally have not bothered bitching in
TML.  I chose to vote with my pocketbook.  I did not buy TNE nor do I plan
to.  Which is really a shame as I own an awful lot of GDW products.  Nor
did I buy MT (I did not like the rebellion; I thought it was a dumb idea.
By now, GDW does too, apparently.)

Well, i guess that\'s enough of a rant.  But you asked, Dave!

    Path of Tears shows a RCES very different than what some people on here
have been assuming the "Star Vikings" to be. They do NOT just indiscriminately
steal technology from worlds. They recover LOST technology, or relics which are
either not being used or which are being MISUSED to oppress people. They do
more than "smash and grab" missions; some planets (even some with TED\'s) are
"trade and diplomacy" only missions. They DO take sides in struggles on the
planets which are balkanized, siding with the least technophobic or xenophobic
faction (or sometimes with the faction most friendly to the RC). They are
trying to establish a reasonably democratic interstellar government. This does
not sound like "fascists" to me. Yes, this type of campaign is more combat-
oriented than the old Imperium campaign; my players don\'t seem to mind this!
As for being T:2000 in space; if the campaign background were set during the
Collapse, I might agree, but TNE is at heart an OPTIMISTIC setting; mankind is
going back to the stars. The holocaust is ending; there is light at the end of
the tunnel for the billions of humans who live in the Wilds. If not the RC,
then the Regency, the Free Trader Network, or even the Guild, will rebuild some
sort of society. All the RC is trying to do is hasten this process and have it
come out better than the Imperium was. T: 2000 is not an optimistic setting.
TNE actually seems like a reaction AGAINST the "dark" RPG\'s of recent memory.
   I\'m excited about the possibilities of my TNE campaign. My players\'
characters will need to learn to be diplomats and explorers as well as soldiers
and they will learn it "on the job". There\'s a certain thrill to knowing that
whatever you do will be shaping history. As a person who liked the original
Traveller and it\'s Imperium since 1979, I really do feel that the New Era
background is excellent.

That would depend on the resources you assigned to the task. You could certainly
colonize more world with the Third Imperium model. In a way, it\'s sort of like
any other government program - you can either supply really nice service to
a small proportion of the populace, or provide basic services to a larger
one.

In a state as large as the Imperium, I think that a market approach might
develop. The Imperium won\'t be directly involved. Some efforts may be on
the level you suggest, funded by multiMCr groups with the latest tech. But
others might be bare bones colonies. Think of the different kinds of colonies
memebers of say, the PTL might found as opposed to those of the Sierra Club.
:)

Basically, you have to pay for convenience. I don\'t think it\'s unrealistic to
assume that the Imperium opted for low-cost undeveloped colonies. Especially
in the case of colonies that developed from prison planets.

Virus makes no sense?
Why not?
Gee your points seem very vague considering we know considerably
very little about the tech level there. For the regency I assume
they acted very..uh..ruthlessly on anything that appeared.
Try not to portray RCES as Star Vikings...oh GOD I hate that name.
I treat em more like the Klingon Diplomatic Service...effective and
rather ruthless but still with an agenda other than booting about
the galaxy giving other races a HARD TIME (tm).

As for no cure for the Virus? The Hivers did pretty well...you also
have to consider that at this time there was meant to be a war on...

Confusion etc etc etc...

Your laboratory being nuked from orbit limits your ability to
research a problem. As does having your computer fire your prototype
antimatter gun at you.
The hardcopy libraries would be there...the fun is for the players
and their cohorts to FIND them.

Your AND/OR statements seem very limited. You say or and no and?
Well it is quite hard to start as a barbarian learning tchnology AND
also at the same time be an interplanetary trader within the Regency.
These things do take time. There is a MT adventure in a recent copy
of Challenge about a lower tech space program. Perhaps the players
can be the cosmonauts on that eh? That covers your barbarians
relearning plus the getting offworld easy.

The central point in all the ANTI-TNE arguements seems to be..

	"But its not CT/MT/2300, Ct/MT/2300 was better..."

Its not meant to be CT/MT/2300. It is however a good idea. It adds a
bit more to the "Okay you head into jump..a week later you come out,
library says iots an amber world. Theres a bit of trouble but the
imperial marines have sorted it out. Crime..yes...but the the
Imperial police have sorted it out. "

Edit the above with...

"Okay you EVENTUALLY arrive at Gnepticon IV, your library computer,
when consulted, says it is a large round pomegranite spinnng at
relativistic speeds in the cosmic bathtub...but you think it may
have memory problems. The Hitchhikers Guide says it is an amber
world..but then it also said there was a working class A
starport..yeah sure. The sensors indicate large amounts of debris
moving at high speeds...energy scan goes off the scale and a
blinding light flashes past your viewport, lucky the compensators
kicked in. You bring the viewer around and see a spidery monstrosity
constructed from bits of starship hulls and space station struts.

I disagree. It is the same old argument about thicker walls..

Lord of Castle: "These walls are 20ft thick. Break them down? Impossible!"

(Outside) BANG! WHEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeee...........BOOOOM!

Lord of Castle: "Ooops..."

You cannot say that simply because the Cymbeline chips are old, that what is 
*in* them (i.e. software) will be limited to current tech capabilities of the 
time. I am not an expert on the *VIRUS* (Da dah!!), but I would have thought
that it would be capable of adapting it cybernetic attacks to cope with 
something with more runtime, memory etc. than it. If I write a virus 
(heaven forbid!) on a ZX81 with UNIX emulation...alright, seriously, an 8088
PC running LINUX, it will still work on someone else\'s HP Apollo, or Sparc-10
or Cray or ANYTHING that runs UNIX. Processor power is irrelevant.
Presumably current Imp. Tech. would have moved to something a bit better than
impure silicon chunks, and started using optical systems, or Josephson
Junctions (yeah!!!). Even so, the same argument applies. Clever software
with enough I/O, is capable of almost **anything**. I just wish the stuff I 
write was nearly as clever...... ;-(  


BTW, has there been any backlash against software engineers due to the Virus?
I mean, it\'s the classic scenario - God Squadders raving on about it being
a punishment - we should never have learnt to program in the first place
etc..., the unwashed masses setting fire to Workstations in the streets, 
line printers being hounded out of town, modems and disk drives living 
together in unmarried sin, RS-232 cables turning to drink and drugs... sorry,
got carried away there!

Well?

James.

with those of us who prefered the 3rd Imperium as it was (with or without
the rebellion). I think GDWs big mistake is in concentrating so heavily
on the Star Vikings (I can barely make myself type such a cheesy title).

GDW would have been far better off coming out with info on the Regency
early on in their publications schedule. This would have addressed many
of the criticisms of TNE that have been voiced on the TML.

I am currently working on a campaign using a \'virus/New Era\' scenario
played out in a universe which is an amalgam of the Traveller Imperium,
Niven\'s Known Space and Star Wars (for the gung-ho adventure ingredient).
I will be using a Chaosium-esqu game system based on the Ringworld game
and CoC. (I found TNE character generation and combat rules far too
unwieldy and wargamey for my tastes.)

FF&S will be very helpful in working out the technology. I will probably
use a downrated verson of subspace drives for FTL travell and Thruster
Plates for STL drives. (HEPLAR? You\'ve got to be joking!). I had already
decided that null-g would only cancel gravity, not provide thrust, so I
was delighted to see that FF&S had gone the same way.

*** WARNING : RULES QUESTION ALERT ***

By the way, I tried working out some sample vehicles on a spreadsheet the
other night. There do not seem to be any scale efficiency modifiers for
large power plants in FF&S. There certainly were in Mega Traveller, is
this deliberate or have I missed them? Ducted fan thrusters would seem
to be utterly useless with the power plants listed up to about TL13 unless
we can get more efficient power production somehow.

*** RULES ALERT OVER ***

As for the \'TNE is a load of crap\' versus \'TNE is as good a background as
any\' debate. I realy don\'t give a toss. I will continue to buy what I want,
raid for useable material then run whatever kind of game I like. Why can\'t
everyone else just do that same and stop slaging off each other\'s campaign
background.


Finaly : Lets be fair, GDW have not killed the Imperial setting. Ok, Empires
rise and fall and this one just fell. But The Regency is still there flying
the flag and there is nothing to stop a new Imperium rising from the ashes
of the old. What GDW hath taken away, GDW can just as easily give back
to us later.

TNE gives us an opportunity to live through a fascinating period in Imperial
history. TNE is more than just savages fighting over the scraps of a fallen
civilisation, it is about growth and renewal. Then, when we have fought the
good fight and wrested civilisation from the jaws of barbarism, we can look
forward to the wheel turning full circle. \'Traveller: The 4th Imperium\'.
Of course it will happen, can you seriously doubt it?

	There were so many very good Campaign plotlines you could develop...

Mysterious patron who keeps helping the group out...finally the group discovers
after some time that the patron is really a surviving ancients sentient
android...should they continue to help him/her/it?  What are its goals...?

The group needs to penetrate a high security complex (for whatever
reason)...they have a cloaking device of some type, but its effects are highly
erratic, because they are not sure how to control it...when it works it is
unstoppable, but when it doesn\'t, watch out!

etc.

	Referee gimmicks are not generally a BAD(tm) thing, but they can be
abused.  Ancients technology gave a good rationale to introduce things into the
Campaign that had an element of mystery and were unpredictable.

	These benign mutations could fall under the same classification.  Hey! 
What would a friendly virus do?  :-\\  What even is a friendly virus?  Hmmm...
the possibilities are endless.

	The key thing is not to over do it.  A gimmick is a good Macguffin or
Campaign thread, but if the group finds itself ``saved\'\' by a different
Ancients\' remnant or friendly virus every week, it has stopped being something
creative and become a crutch instead.

 Sorry, looks like I was behind in current GDW terminology... I had no 
idea they used that as a measure of acceleration, which it isn\'t.
A G-hour is a measure of velocity, and it\'s use as a measure of reaction
mass fits perfectly with that- reaction mass is usually measured by the 
total change in velocity it can achieve. 
(and, if velocity is measured in G-turns then acceleration is measured 
in G, so why did they complicate the term with two meanings?)
 Just wanted to say, I wasn\'t trying to confuse anyone- in my small
brain acceleration for ships is still measured in G...  It never occurred
to me that G-turn could be confused  with acceleration

 Now, for David Johnson\'s battle of the backgrounds... or is it battle of
the automobiles?
  As he said, Round Three....
 
    Well it really looks like TNE has failed to bring in many advantages,
 the only NEW thing in there is the virus, and that\'s not to everyones 
 taste. So the popularity of TNE seems to depend on it\'s support and it\'s
 rules... there isn\'t much more background to discuss at the moment- GDW
 have not told you anything about what happens in the future. It\'s almost
 as big a spectator sport as the Rebellion. What is jumpstart/longbow/Avery/
 the black curtain- will we find out this millenium?, will we care? When 
 you consider how many people were unimpressed with the \'secret\' of the
 ancients (well *I* liked it) never mind the virus, chances are that many
 will be disappointed.
    Straying slightly (only a bit, trust me) into the grey area between 
 rules and background is the other large difference between the two
 settings that I\'ve mentioned before- the equipment. Even if CT and TNE
 were identical in background, you\'d notice a BIG difference in the
 capabilities of weapons/armour/starships/vehicles- all the other 
 changes tend to conceal them. Do you prefer thruster plates and 
 fusion guns with infinite ammo, powerful/light gauss rifles and pistols,
 starships with fewer crew, triple turrets?... and so on. In an SFRPG
 the technology is part of the background as much as the astrography.
 With FF&S it is obvious that TNE has an advantage in this area, since
 you can partly alter the technology to suit you game, but some people
 might prefer the simplicity of the old Traveller... you can have any
 starship laser, as long as it\'s 250MW, don\'t take your foot off the floor,
 we have two weeks more thrust at 6G, keep firing that fusion gun till
 the power plant goes (not that I ever used them much). Those small but
 annoying changes can stop people changing over, it even stopped some 
 people switching from CT to MT, never mind TNE. Personally I\'m just too
 old and set-in-my-ways to change, as are the people I play with, but TNE
 does have good points in this background area.
  
    It\'s likely that most people didn\'t buy this Yugo just because it\'s
  the only car in town- there are a few supported SFRPGs out there, and
  several have certain similarities with Traveller :>, so there was a BIT of
  choice.

This is a good point.  I didn\'t mean to suggest that `backround\' had some
greater value than `rules\' - that just happens to be my own opinion.  :-)
I don\'t think this issue can be resolved - hence my attempt to keep the
discussion focused on `background\' issues.

I agree with much of what Dane said about the TNE backgound.  He continues
to make the case that it offers little over a CT/MT setting that ventures
outside the core of the Old Imperium and yet takes a huge toll on the
exisiting campaign.

I\'m in the second camp and feel the same way.  What about some of you new
people?  Does this make sense?

This idea is the most (so far, *only*) interesting possibility suggested
by TNE - and, to my knowledge, has yet to be developed at all in any of
the official material coming out of GDW.  Too bad we can\'t copywright an
idea.  :-)  Of course the sort of change that the Butlerian Jihad engendered
in the *Dune* universe couldn\'t happen in just 70 years.

Several folks have made the point that TNE would make more sense, for a
variety of reasons, if the `time warp\' was something much greater than
70 years.  That\'s a good point but I\'d simply ask these folks what you\'d
really like to see happen if GDW were to have a `New Coke\' revelation:
they say, "Oops!" and move TNE forward another couple of decades; or they
say, "Dallas!" and issue a CT/MT `Frontier Sourcebook\'?  :-)

That\'s all for Friday\'s postings.

Right.  And I haven\'t, but I\'d like to have some more Traveller material
if it\'s an improvement over CT/MT.

Okay, you bought it because you liked the convenience of the new rules and
the new background in one handy book.  If the `CT/MT Frontier Sourcebook\'
had had the new rules too would you still have bought TNE?  Remember, I\'m
not asking about the House System rules.  What is there about that TNE
background, if anything, that is better than background for a CT/MT
frontier campaign?

The `mutated tech\' idea mentioned above is one such idea but then even that
could have been accomplished in an expansion of the frontier of the CT/MT
setting.  The Virus could have evolved outside of the Imperium and have been
an approaching menace - like the Borg were in Star Trek - you\'d get the
`mutated goodies\' without having to destroy the Imperium.  Nevertheless,
IMHO, there\'s a small spark of hope for TNE in this idea.

It seems clear then that TNE answers a call for a `frontier\' setting,
that\'s great; but in doing so it also asks those of use who adventured in the
CT/MT background to abandon most of what\'s been developed for that setting.
That\'s asking a lot especially because one can also discover that `frontier\'
setting in the CT/MT campaign with some extra effort (whether supported by
GDW or not).  So, again, I pose the question: what\'s the improvement offered
by TNE over the CT/MT background?  Do you see that in this context the fact
that TNE is merely `different\' isn\'t good enough?  Unless each of us has an
unlimited supply of funds, the TNE setting ought to be an improvement over
the CT/MT setting.

Okay, here\'s a good point to move on from.  What sort of different cultures?
And what\'s the advantage of developing these new cultures within regions of
the Old Imperium?  Remember though, they\'ll only have 70 years to diverge
from Imperial culture.  There will still be folks alive who remember Strephon,
not many, but a few.

Don\'t give up hope!  Remember `New Coke\'!  :-)  Then again, does anyone know
where the guy/gal who came up with `New Coke\' ended up?  It couldn\'t have
been GDW, could it?  :-)

Me too!  And I\'ll bet that\'s enough to get a lot of folks to buy TNE whether
they think it\'s better or not.  (Maybe that `New Coke\' gal/guy wasn\'t so
dumb after all - she/he was just in the wrong industry!)

Nice idea but it won\'t happen.  Development and production costs for each
era (market segment) would have to be spread over a smaller customer base.
That\'s h**l for profits.

Don\'t be so sure.  Have you seen the latest design for Space Station
*Freedom*?  It\'s some US/European/Japanese modules attached to the orbiting
Russian *Mir* space station.  The Space Program was born in Cold War
competition and now cooperation is all that\'s keeping it from the budget

You\'re confirming my suspicions that much of the `support\' for TNE comes
from the cold, hard fact that that\'s all there is if you\'re interested in
Traveller.  That\'s fine, but it\'s not for me.  Do we concede that this is
the only real advantage (it\'s a big one, I agree) of TNE over CT/MT from
a background point-of-view?  Remember, a `Frontier Sourcebook\' could have
overhauled that `old imperial chevy\' into a shiny hot rod - but it would
have been more difficult to sell the `new\' House rules to everyone that way.

Another good way to hook `old timers\' whether TNE is any good or not, right?

I really don\'t understand the attraction of doing this sort of thing in
Imperial space.  A lot of folks are saying this.  What\'s the deal?  Yes,
with TNE, GDW is now *supporting* frontier adventuring more but this would
also have been the case with a CT/MT frontier sourcebook.  So, isn\'t this
just another case of TNE being the only choice available rather than any
sort of improvement?

You want an interesting frontier?  How about a Virus that spreads through the
Solomani Party apparatus (biological or computer), leaving destruction in it\'s
wake.  The Imperium manages to fend it off, all the excitment of TNE exists in
the Solomani Sphere (which hadn\'t been developed so nothing has to go in the
trash) and you kill off those neo-Nazis and `liberate\' Terra all at the same
time!

Okay, even I\'m getting tired of reading me.  Let\'s move on to these new
societies.  What sorts of things are folks doing?  Are you adventuring in
pocket empires?  Exploring, or pillaging, with the Star Vikings?  Expanding
the Quarantine Line of the Regency?

Here\'s a good point.  The RCES (the Reformation Coalition?) sounds a lot like
the Space Vikings of H. Beam Piper\'s novel of the same name.  (You notice I
mistakenly referred to the `Star Vikings\' in my last posting as the `Space
Vikings\'.  Clearly, I\'m not the only one making this connection.  Those of
you who are familiar with Piper will recall that those `high-tech barbarians\'
that raided the remnants of the `Empire\' came from the Sword Worlds - which
were `appropriated\' by the folks at GDW a long time ago.)  Sound familiar?

Also, if you\'ve read Piper\'s novel, it\'s not at all the case that these
`barbarians\' have to be `bad guys\'.  Yes, most of them slaughtered innocents
pretty much indiscriminately (they used nukes rather than a Virus - more
honorable Space Vikings called this `chicken stealing\') but there were a few,
like the novel\'s protagonist Lucas Trask, who had the idea of rebuilding a
new civilization.

So, does this make TNE sort of a GURPS Space Vikings but with the GDW House
Rules and the names changed to protect the innocent?  Hopefully, Steve
Jackson (and the holder\'s of Beam\'s copyrights?) reads TML too!  :-)

Okay folks, if TNE is inevitable despite the fact that it doesn\'t offer any
thing that wasn\'t possible in CT/MT, let\'s try to `lie back and enjoy it\'.
Anyone see any options for TNE other than those above?  Any way to turn
any of those `ORs\' into `ANDs\'?  Which situation are you adventuring in?
Please tell us about it.

As for other options, we\'ve heard from folks who continue to use the CT/MT
background (often with `unofficial\' regions on the Imperium\'s fringe) where
the Virus, and sometimes even the Rebellion, never happened.  What are you
folks up to now?  Any folks adventuring even farther back in the Imperium\'s
past?

And finally, has anyone else out there abandoned Imperial space altogether
and developed a campaign background that\'s unrelated to the Imperium at all?

   Anyone remember the "Yankee Air Pirates"? These were a group of guys who

Is this really any dumber than "Star Vikings" (which, incidentally, was first

name is part of an anti-RC propoganda campaign being waged by the Guild.
Sometimes you don\'t get to choose these things.

 It isn\'t really a unit of acceleration, but a unit of _movement_.
Blame part of the strangeness on my late-night-and-long-unused grasp of
physics.  The G-Turn is just a new label for the old Mayday relationship
between thrust and movement: One G for One Turn (one G-Turn) changes
the ship\'s position by One Hex from what it would have been without the
thrust.  This is the definition always in use.
 Why use the label for fuel as well?  Because it only requires a
calculator during _design_, not during play: Your 3 G ship has fuel for
20 G-Turns of thrust remaining in the fuel tanks; the pilot applies
(for ship-to-ship combat) 3 Gs for the length of one turn, to get
the ship going where he wants it.  The fuel tanks now contain 17 G-Turns
worth of fuel.

 On a different matter, goldman@orac.cray.com
(Goldman of Chaos -- postmaster CRI-US) mentioned:

 Indeed. Here is the layout:

 +----+----+----+----+
 |    |    |    |    |   a: Far Frontiers Sector
 | a  | b  | c  | d  |   b: Foreven Sector
 |    |    |    |    |   c: Spinward Marches Sector
 |    |    |    |    |   d: Deneb Sector
 +----+----+----+----+
 |    |    |    |    |   e: Vanguard Reach Sector
 | e  | f  | g  | h  |   f: Beyond Sector
 |    |    |    |    |   g: Trojan Reach Sector
 |    |    |    |    |   h: Reft Sector
 +----+----+----+----+

 To get to The Beyond from the Marches, head to Five Sisters subsector
and keep going (as the map sits) down and to the left, from \'c\' to \'f\'.
 The right half of the above sketch (CDGH) is the "Domain of Deneb".
Of the left half, Far Frontiers is being (re)printed in The Traveller
Chronicle, Foreven is officially off-limits for printed development
beyond what was in Imperial Lines #1, and Chuck Kallenbach is still
(and forever) working on the Vanguard Reach. It seems that I heard
that someone had started to redo the Beyond, but I don\'t know who.

 For the curious, the Virus Quarantine border cuts Deneb in half top
to bottom, then runs from the center-top of Reft to the center-bottom
of the Trojan Reach.  The border seems to follow the edge of the Rift
to spin-rimward (left and down).  Where the border goes to coreward
(up) varies. A HIWG map of Gvurrdon runs the border in a long curve
from bottom-right to top-left, where it hits the Zhodani Consulate
and presumably follows that border out into no-traffic-land.  The
map in the TNE book suggests that the border runs the tops of Deneb
and the Marches until it hits the Consulate and heads coreward. I
prefer the idea of some of Gvurrdon\'s larger Vargr states surviving,
myself.

    'body' => 'For those who expressed an interest in the material I
had posted here is what happened from the primary NPC\'s
point of view...

	Neil Hart had had an offer from AllCo Genetics for transfering
his technology to the gene pool. He couldn\'t take all his work
from Red Wizard legally so he worked it into a game object,
a alien-proof suit of armour. He then appeared in the game as
a "king" alien and gave it to a player who worked on a merchant
ship.
	Before that he had hacked local computers to arrange a
hot-shit cargo for the Baperte system (where AllCo is based)
to be "accidentally" re-routed to the same ship.
	Unfortunately they ship refused the cargo. Repeatedly.
Eventually blowing dock before it was physically loaded on.
This kind of put Neil in a position. He had just been fired
from Red Wizard because his aliens completely took over the
RealVision arcade and shut it down. He had three AllCo heavies
breathing down his neck and no data.
	He took the next ship to Ubedewi (where they had jumped)
"bumped into" them there and hired their ship for three jumps
without telling them where they were going. He paid them with
a run-time copy of "Bughunt on Ryleh", worth about 1.2MCr. His
heavies turned up and "accompanied him".
	Next he jumped them one at a time toward Baperte, them not
realising that they were going in that direction. His plan was
that they would eventually play the game using the armour. He
would copy the data and invalidate the cube. Unfortunately they
all refused to touch the game and didn\'t acknowledge the existence
of the cube.
	On the final approach to Allewont in the Baperte system
Neil starts demanding that his cabin has been broken into and
a data crystal stolen. He and his heavies walk (through the
computer security) onto the crew deck and make for the cabin of
the crewmember who had the crystal.
	The crew tells Allewont (whose only inhabitants work for AllCo)
that there is a hijack on board and they warm up their laser turrets
and tell them to land or else. The pilot gives a five second warning
and cuts the gravity. They are decelerating at 2G but most people
manage to grab a hand-hold. Execpt one crew-member who fall 1m and
hurts themself and Neil who was in a corridor. He falls 4.5m, takes
8 dice of damage and gets all three stats reduced to zero. Oooops.
	They turn the gravity back on and take the weapons out of the
ship\'s locker. The heavies are unarmed and cease hostile activities.
They don\'t move from the coridor. Hart is moved to a low berth.
	The pilot makes a run for it using the landing hanger as
cover from one of the lasers. The other gets a shot and they take
a fuel hit. They fly off nap-of-earth and are only exposed for
one combat round before they can use the horizon as cover.
	Allewont base send a shuttle after them and a chase ensues.
Their laser, and all internal doors, had been hot-wired by Neil to
Neil which leaves them a little bolloxed. They try to plea-bargin
with Allewont saying they will hand over Neil and the crystal for
5MCr (paid in advance). Allewont demands they return to base and 
submit to a full ship search in return for the 5MCr. If they don\'t
agree they will spend the 5MCr on a mercenary contract to get them.
The ship capitulates.
	In the end Allewont only takes Neil and the data and lets the
ship go without any malicious extra damage (except taking a gene
sample from each crewmember and their cat).
	The body would take weeks to heal which doesn\'t suit their
time-table. They have the equipment for full body regrowth and
memory transfer, though. The first stage is to record the brain.
For best results this is done in a destructive way. Normally they
would later play this into a new "blank" brain.
	However they also have the facilities to run the stored
information on a mainframe (sort of an AI). They did this to validate
that Hart\'s knowledgebase was intact. (They didn\'t want to let the
others go until they know the goods were intact) As they wired his
senses to a simple accomidation and computer terminal environment
Neil hasn\'t actually noticed!
	So Allewont currently don\'t plan to reconstruct the body.
They\'ve made a press release (after the ship left) to the effect
that Dr. Neil Hart has died from injuries sustained abort the
Merchant Ship Rainbow\'s End. Brain Death occured on...

Hello everybody!

I am starting up my 2300AD campaign this week, and I have a question to ask:

What third party 2300AD products exists? I have one set of Seeker deck plans 
and
I have \'Operation Overlord\'. What other products and fanzines exists? I 
remember
reading about a fanzine on TML. Does it still exist? Is it possible to get 
backcopies ?

Subject: cyberpunk & bionics in traveller

Some Questions for the Assembled TML Wisdom to Ponder:
======================================================

What world characteristics do people think would be appropriate for the 
development of a cyberpunk style society in Traveller? I tend to think an 
Early Stellar tech, High Population world at least is required (or the 
world is a colony of such a place). What else - Government type?

If you can suggest example worlds please do so - especially if within the 
Spinward Marches.

How socially acceptable do you think artificial body parts/bionics would 
be in the Imperium at large?

What about \'organ legging\', as per Larry Niven\'s stories (and now the real 
world, or so it is rumoured)? Do you think this crime can exist in the 
Imperium? If yes, where and why? If not, why not?

Subject: RE:Background

Rather than more discussion of TNE background vs CT or MT background, I\'d 
rather see:

- - anyone\'s favourite PC [or NPC] written up, like the Casual Encounter or 
77th Patron articles in JTAS/Challenge. What sort of things do they like 
doing? How could they be used in a campaign, e.g. as a Patron, an ally or 
adversary, or someone who applies to the PCs for a job perhaps?

- - a writeup of a world that has figured prominently in a campaign you\'ve 
been running or playing in.

- - scenario ideas, even if brief, like the old Amber Zone articles.

- - setting ideas, even if only brief or incomplete.

- - some more \'newspaper\' adverts (one of these days I hope to have the spare 
time to collate whats been sent. In the meantime they are still useful as 
they are).

- - Organisations of the Imperium: we have Megacorps documented, and some 
other organisations. What other organisations have people created to add 
life to their campaigns, and how have the worked out?

This is the sort of background information I would find interesting. So if 
you have this sort of stuff but don\'t think it is of interest to the list, 
there is at least one person who is.

I don\'t care which setting you put them in - CT, MT, TNE, or even 2300.

All this whining about the New Era is starting to get tiresome!

It\'s one thing to _discuss_ the changes made -- how they affect play, how they
will work in your campaign, etc. -- it\'s another thing to _complain_ about
the alterations in the Traveller universe.  Constructive criticism is fine,
but these endless rounds of "TNE sucks!" "Does Not!" "Does too!" are starting
to get really boring.  Not to mention the waste of bandwidth.

  As Allen? Shock pointed out, the RCES are now described as a reasonably
"peaceful" and diplomatic group. You could always guess that it was
the intention of GDW to paint them in a good light, it was just that
all the previous descriptions of the Chicken Stealers in TNE tended
to show their "Ubermensch" (sp) attitude. Those who considered the
RCES to be self-serving totalitarian evangelicals trying to force
people to accept their twisted morality... certainly had a point-
but they never thought that was the whole story. 
  I think it\'s good that they HAVE finally shown the nice side of the
Star Vikings in more detail, and Path of Tears sounds a good book-
I would have difficulty running the RCES as good guys with the info
in TNE, and I do want to hear about it, for the following reason...
  As Traveller as gone on, it has certainly made it a tradition to
show both sides of the story for every society- it was always at the
GMs discretion whether to use good/bad (Zhodani/Solomani/K\'Kree etc)
or simply "tell it as it is" and let the PCs decide, so doing the 
same for the RCES is to be expected 
  (and BTW- the two sides certainly applied to the Third Imperium,does
anyone remember how nasty it seemed in Adventure 1- The Kinunir?)
  
   Here\'s a big hello to the new, improved, nicer RCES. Some have been
using them from the start, some just wanted a bit more evidence than 
that given in TNE.

  And, Allen, it\'s a bit unfair to knock T:2000 to defend TNE- the

Re: Path of Tears
  As Allen? Shock pointed out, the RCES are now described as a reasonably
"peaceful" and diplomatic group. You could always guess that it was
the intention of GDW to paint them in a good light, it was just that
all the previous descriptions of the Chicken Stealers in TNE tended
to show their "Ubermensch" (sp) attitude. Those who considered the
RCES to be self-serving totalitarian evangelicals trying to force
people to accept their twisted morality... certainly had a point-
but they never thought that was the whole story. 
  I think it\'s good that they HAVE finally shown the nice side of the
Star Vikings in more detail, and Path of Tears sounds a good book-
I would have difficulty running the RCES as good guys with the info
in TNE, and I do want to hear about it, for the following reason...
  As Traveller as gone on, it has certainly made it a tradition to
show both sides of the story for every society- it was always at the
GMs discretion whether to use good/bad (Zhodani/Solomani/K\'Kree etc)
or simply "tell it as it is" and let the PCs decide, so doing the 
same for the RCES is to be expected 
  (and BTW- the two sides certainly applied to the Third Imperium,does
anyone remember how nasty it seemed in Adventure 1- The Kinunir?)
  
   Here\'s a big hello to the new, improved, nicer RCES. Some have been
using them from the start, some just wanted a bit more evidence than 
that given in TNE.

  And, Allen, it\'s a bit unfair to knock T:2000 to defend TNE- the
time in T:2000 is ALSO a time of rebuilding when looked at in an
optimistic way- most of the scenarios are "Help these people/ Do this

This is really of interest to me.  One of the `failings\' of Traveller IMHO
has always been the focus on combat skills - hence the expanded character
generation for army, marines, navy and even scouts and merchants than could
be paramilitary characters.  This is a rules issue but (I\'m beginning to be
swayed by Anthony "K." Baggaley\'s arguments) I feel this focus has always
been influenced by all those rules for handling combat and for all that
nifty iron-mongery.  Imagine a game with rules for `peaceful\' conflict
resolution, negotition and such that were as in-depth as the combat rules
in Traveller (or any other RPG).

I know I\'m beating a dead horse, but I think we\'ve pretty much established
that all of the above could have taken place in a CT/MT campaign that was
removed a sector or two from the Imperium.  Please, let\'s move on to particular
details of TNE.

This is a good idea.  It\'s like the Butlerian Jihad from *Dune* that led
to the abolition of computers and the rise of `mentats\' - humans trained
to function as biological `computers\'.  A similar theme in TNE would be
quite interesting.

Of course this is what\'s in store.  And according to the above review of *Path
of Tears* GDW is already laying the groundwork.  I wonder if in five years
or so we won\'t have all the TNE devotees being `bashed\' for being `old
timers\' who `just don\'t want to change\' because they\'re upset at the 
release of TFI (Traveller: The Fourth Imperium) which `abandons\' TNE.  :-)
(Actually, I don\'t wonder.  This is a given as well.)

This is a good point, as I mentioned above.  I\'ve just sort of always
ignored these sorts of issues.  I\'ve taken a page from Gene Roddenberry\'s book.
He was pressed early on by NBC to come up with explanations for things like
phasors - how they worked.  He refused (and nearly 30 years later we still
don\'t know) on the grounds that an explanation wasn\'t needed in order to have
a good story.  He used the example of Joe Friday and his .38.  He points
it at a bad guy, there\'s some indication of activation (a flash of light
and a lound crack - or a beam of light and a high-pitched whine for a phasor),
and the bad guy falls down.  No explanation necessary.

Nevertheless, I can see where rules (character generation makes more sense
to me than technology, but you get the point) *can* influence the nature of
the campaign background.  So, what sorts of effects on the background are
a result of the new TNE rules?  (But let\'s try not to argue about what the
rules are, or how they\'re marred - just focus on the result from a background
point of view.)

Me too (second-hand MT), but not twice (TNE), at least not yet . . . .  :-)

Okay, where are we?  We\'ve started to discover the exploration opportunities
of the Space, er, Star Vikings of the Reformation Coalition.  And we\'ve touched
on the effects of TNE technology rules on the campaign settings.  We\'ve also
mentioned the aspects created by an aversion to computers and technology in
general.  And finally there\'s the gimmick of `positive\' viral mutation
technologies.  All of these are avenues ripe for further discussion and 
development.

What about the other areas?  Adventure opportunities in the Regency and in
the Pocket Empires?  What are the Guild and the Free Trader Network?  What
about the Hivers?  The other Aliens?  The Zhodani and the Solomani?  Anybody
still *behind* this `black curtain\' helping Lucan\'s descendants fight
WWIV with sticks and rocks?  Do tell!

Okay, time for me to burn some bandwith with my personal opinions.

Here\'s what I think about TNE.  I love the new rules (except for the
loss of reactionless drives in "official" games--oh well, I\'ve never
been too "official" anyway).

The setting.  Yes, now that the aggregate Tech Level of the galaxy has
fallen, the game does feel more like Twilight:5800 rather then
Traveller.  It doesn\'t have the same science fiction feel that CT or
even MT had.

Everyone seems to love the old CT setting because it was so stable. 
Personally, I loved MT, I thought that it provided a very interesting
mix of politics, location, and science fiction that you couldn\'t achieve
with the Frontier Wars.  But I digress...

The big problem that I have with TNE is that there is very little
support for anything but an RCES campaign.  Take a look at the stuff
that Loren said was being released over the next year or two.  All I see
is RCES stuff!  Guess what?  I don\'t like the RCES campaign setting! 
Why?  It\'s quite simple, it has a Tech Level that my campaign doesn\'t
want to play in.  We happen to like luxury over grim-and-gritty.  "Okay"
you say, "start the campaign in the Regency" you say.  I want to, but
where\'s all the nifty detail on it?  The odd glance that you get in the
TNE book is not enough to start a good in-depth.  I want UWP\'s, I want
patrons, I want a bunch of other things.  Get the picture.  Good,
because it doesn\'t seem like GDW does.

Why am I bitching and moaning?  It\'s not because I think that the RCES
is crap.  In fact, I disagree, I think that it\'s a very strong
campaign.  But (there\'s always a but), it\'s not the campaign for me. 
No, I don\'t view the RCES as only Star Vikings out to conquer.  But I
would rather play in a less military-oriented campaign.

I find this very upsetting.  When there was CT, GDW gave sectors to
specific publishers, and let them develop them.  Do you know how great
it was to have a wealth of info for anything from Ley Sector to The
Spinward Marches to wherever.  And then with MT, the concentration was
on the Spinward Marches and Deneb (originally).  But there was always
more then enough information on the rest of the Imperium, and no one
faction of the Rebellion was truly concentrated over another one.  And
there was always The Traveller\'s Digest/MegaTraveller Journal which had
a wealth of information for all parts of the galaxy, and all types of
players and campaigns.  Boy do I miss having a Traveller mag (at least,
and at last there\'s The Traveller Chronicle).

The more I see of TNE (and yes, I\'m saying this after seeing all of the
releases for TNE), the more I wish that GDW did sell the rights for
Traveller to DGP.  Maybe then we could have had "Traveller:  The New
Era--Traveller Done Right."

Dear T. Craig:
 
In answer to your question about what rules to use from your
extensive collection, my advice is to "pick and choose".
 
That is, the rules are basically modular, and can be mixed and
matched with relative ease.
 
Consider using the following selection of game components:
 
    As for campaign material, running your "virgins" through the
    classic adventures would allow you to review the game in
    general, and would give you time to study up on the new
    stuff.  Also, having run the material before, you should be
    more masterful with it -- you and your players would probably
    enjoy it more.
 
    Character generation -- keep it simple.  Since you are
    dealing with beginners, it\'s better to just hand your players
    a selection of premade characters (which would be easy for
    you to arbitrarily throw together without using any system)
    and let the players edit them a bit, rather than running them
    through a grueling hours-on-end generation session.
 
    Skills -- from any Traveller source.  More skills to choose
    from adds spice to the game, and to NPC\'s.  The list in
    MegaTravller\'s Players Manual is a good place to start.
 
    Equipment from any of your publications.  The more equipment
    to choose from, the better.
 
    Combat -- New era, if you have it.  Classic, otherwise.
    Note that in Classic Traveller, skill levels are valued in
    relation to the 8 required for success rolled on two 6-sided
    dice.  Therefore, rarely should a character be allowed to
    have more than a "3" in any skill level.  A skill-level of 5
    gives a 3/36 of failure, and a skill-6 gives a 1/36 chance of
    failure, so avoid these high levels like the plague.  In
    later rules editions (especially New Era), a wider range of
    probability for success/failure is used (20-sided die).
 
    Ships -- forget designing your own unless you have loads of
    time and are a glutton for punishment.  Ship descriptions,
    illustrations, and deckplans are strewn throughout the
    Classic material.  (Adventures 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, Double
    Adventures 1, 3, 5, JTAS 1, 8, Challenge 25, and Supplement
    5, and 7 all have ship deckplans in them).  Classic also
    contained juicy historical tidbits on the ships.
    MegaTraveller, on the other hand, contains very few
    deckplans, and even less background on the ships.
 
    Worlds -- MegaTraveller developed the most space.  There are
    several sector maps besides the Spinward Marches that have
    appeared here and there (in Digest Group\'s products,
    Challenge mag, etc.).  The Spinward Marches is still the most
    developed area, however.
 
    Aliens -- Aliens are virtually non-existent in MegaTraveller,
    though there weren\'t all that many more in Classic.
 
    Robots -- See 101 Robots, by Digest Group Publications.  \'Nuff said.
 
 
Here are some playing tips:
 
    1)  Adlib (or gather or design in advance) some ALIENS for
    starship, starport, and world encounters.  Traveller
    adventure material is notably devoid of alien encounters,
    even though there are hundreds of alien species running
    around out there.  Interjecting aliens into game play and
    exposing your players to aliens and alien customs can enrich
    your campaign and provide lead-ins to interesting adventures
    later.
 
    The most likely places to run into aliens include:  Alien
    homeworlds, at starports (as starport personnel, travellers,
    or starship crew) trade centers, in alien-ethnic parts of
    town, taverns, mingling with the populace, and in space (on
    the comm viewscreen).
 
    2)  Adlib (or prepare in advance) some ROBOTS into your
    starport and world encounters.  Robots abound on TL 12 and
    better worlds.  Starships would also make heavy use of them,
    as would crews sent dirtside from such craft.  Don\'t forget
    that robots are a major feature in the scenery of starports,
    cities, installations, etc., on most TL12+ worlds.
 
    3)  Go through the adventure you plan to run IN ADVANCE.
    Prepare missing maps, floorplans, or deckplans of every place
    you expect your players will go.  Alternately, you could
    canabalize appropriate layouts from already existing
    published materials.  The maps and floorplans are essential
    for providing a common point of reference to base actions and
    reactions, making the scenario much easier to visualize, for
    you and your players.
 
    4)  Prepare your NPC\'s in advance, to give them more realism
    in play.  The more thought you give to their appearance,
    personality, and background, the more like real people they
    will seem to your players, and the easier it will be for them
    to visualize and interact with them.
 
Hope that helps.  Let me know if you found any of this useful.
 
                Sincerely,

and are concerned about that type of thing.


First off, I have not been a fan of the TNE era and have
made my share of snotty remarks about GDW.(I suggested a
wake for the Imperium last april and made references to maniacal
butcher knife attacks on TNE authors among other things).

That all being said, I liked the Path of Tears. I thought
it was of the best products I have seen come out of GDW
in years. Some of the best planetary detail yet. (Though
that could have just been as easily done as a "Client States of the Imperium"
book without the murder of the Third Imperium being necessary ;-). )

My mental picture of the Reformation Coalition is a lot more
flattering that I thought it would be. GDW actually makes
"killing the locals and taking home the neat stuff that don\'t belong
to us"(the SAG mission) seem like a noble and self sacrificing
endeavour! Forgetting the  bombed cities, dead civilians and 
crying babies and all that stuff that goes with clobbering the opposition. 
At least the original Space Viking(Prince Trask) in the H.Beam Piper
novel used to get nightmares about dead childeren. It don\'t seem 
to bother the RCES.

The political structure and currents of the RC are
quite well described as well as RC motivation.

That being all the good things, I have  a few observations
about this RCES gaming universe for GDW\'s consumption.

	1. I like the Guild, but haven\'t they been set up
	  as a straw man opponent? From what is described
	  they appear to be both too strong in actions and 
	  too weak in supporting capabilities. We\'re told 
	  that they are not a government, but in PoT, their
	  agents appear to be everywhere. The Guild seems
	  to have designed and manufactured  tanks and
	  all sorts of weaponry. Where are the factories
	  and designers?(I can\'t believe its all done
	  by ships crew during jump transit) Either the
	  guild is a group of derelict ship captains in
	  a sub sector or two, who couldn\'t possibly
	  support this infrastructure, or its a force
	  thats at least as strong as the RC.(wheres
	  the worlds it controls then?)

       2. If the Guild is going to be the big bad guy.
	  I suggest the GDW come out with a a source book
	  for them. I wouldn\'t mind playing guild characters.
	  Give the support to be a guild agent, guild ship
	  captain or slaver. Explain the economics of
	  slavery in this environment. 

       3. I kinda like the idea of the Guild being the
	  anarchists of space.(makes you wonder if they
	  fly the black flag of anarchy). But in all
	  seriousness, I don\'t know if their attitude
	  towards multi-planet government is likely.
	  Sure, gov\'t caused the mess, but I bet that
	  any one of those merchant captains would 
	  prefer to have a big navy cruiser commin\' to the
	  rescue with lasers and particle accelerators 
	  a flashing, when a pirate starts chasing the cargo.
	  Remember, the merchant\'s ships big problems
	  arose when the gov\'t ceased to exist.

	4. The wild\'s strangely enough is more civilized
	   than I think it should be. There seems to be
	   mostly Tech level 5-9 worlds out there. There
	   seems to be a lot of ships(free trader and guild)
	   still plying the space ways.(where are the pirates?)

	   Some of the these worlds, don\'t make sense. Worlds
	   have "data priests" that are in the tech 5-9 eras.
	   Given that we are talking 20th Century technology,
	   it takes a rather sophisticated population to support
	   such a technology(just take a good look around you).
	   A population that can support tech 5-9 just doesn\'t
	   seem the type to go in for supersitious data priests.
	   I consider the data priest in that tech level as
	   dumbfounding as the Virus itself. I quite believe
	   that data priests could be found in 2-3, but in
	   tech 5-9, too much of the population has
	   to support the technology, for a data priest syndrome
	   to really set in.(IMHO)

        5. TED model seems to be too simplistic for the worlds
	   described. (Mass balkanization seems to have occurred).
	   The general impression that GDW gives is every TED is
	   a bum whom the population could care less about. Anybody
	   who is leading a nation >=4 in tech level and with
	   at least hundreds of thousands and greater population,
	   is actually setting on a fairly sophisticated and
	   bureaucratic state(have to be it wouldn\'t run otherwise).
	   These nations got created somehow, where is the force
	   of nationalism? Maybe in the description of the
	   gov\'ts GDW should give a loyalty of the population
	   indicator(from openly seditous, to indifferent,
	   to your basic throw yourself in the line of fire to
	   protect our sainted TED). Let me use a real world example,
	   Iraqi\'s(the lower tech zips) have been merrily overthrowing
	   their TEDS for years, now the US(re RCES) and others come
	   around and try to force the current TED out, and
	   between the TED\'s terror and the locals rallying
	   around the TED(because he\'s OUR bloody TED and
	   no outsider is going to tell us what to do), the
	   TED gets stronger and stays in power for a record
	   length of time(i.e stronger state apparatus than
	   apparent and force of nationalism than TED model
	   implies).


	   Well, enough ranting, I actually did enjoy the product.

  So what if Virus is scientifically impossible?

Sure it\'s fiction.  But remember that little trait of fiction
called "SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF"?  What would your reaction be
to a scenario where the players\' ship has a drive failure during
gas giant refuelling, and they crash-land on a solid surface, 
with a breathable atmosphere, and meet inhabitants that seem strangely
like the denizens of Flash Gordon\'s planet Mongo?

 Either you\'re goining to say to yourself "ok, this is THAT kind of 
campaign" (which doesn\'t pretend to any degree of realism), or you\'re 
going to say "Bulls**t!". For some people, the Virus hits their 
"B.S.!" buttons and wrecks their suspension of disbelief.  They play 
Traveller  for a campaign that to them seems at least mostly 
realistic, and to them, the Virus is as out of place as 
Voltan\'s Hawkmen.

> All of the best science-fiction I\'ve ever
 read was about PEOPLE,
> not things;

Actually, they weren\'t about PEOPLE either.  Personnel files are 
about PEOPLE.

All the best fiction (science and otherwise) is about people AND
the CHOICES they make, the ACTIONS they take, and how they deal
with the CONSEQUENCES of those actions...

>things work just because they work.


 ...and often, those choices and actions are determined by what
their equipement can do, which can in turn depend on HOW it works.
Can you use the HEPlaR thrusters on a grav-bike as a makeshift
plasma gun?  Enquiring players are going to want to know, and 
GMs sometimes have to think things through before they decide
which way to go. {By the way, No, they can\'t use it that way}

Another thing is the effective endurance of maneuver drives.
Either it\'s practically unlimited (thruster plates, house-rules
modified HEPlaRs) or not (GDW-standard HEPlaRs).  Whichever
one you pick, it\'s going to have an effect on combat, refuelling,
system defense, a host of issues where it can become important.
And if you DON\'T pick one and stick with it, the players are going 
to start asking how it is that they can zip all over a system to
their hearts\' content, but whenever another ship shows up
they suddenly have a fuel limit.

Fair enough, but please admit your version is a tad different
from how the RCES were presented in SURVIVAL MARGIN and the
TNE rulebook.  Admittedly this is a caricature, but the Star Vikings
have come across more like:

     "Once upon a time, there was the Dawn League, who sent out 
twelve ships to recontact the worlds cut off since the Collapse.
     "The brave captain smiled a great big grin. \'Hi there\' he said,
\'I\'m Captain Bernard Kirk of the Dawn League Starship Enterprise.
 Can you and I be friends?\'   **BLAM!!!** was the response.
       "When word got back to the DL, they cracked their knucles,
tightened their headbands, stuck BIIIIIG knives in their sheathes,  
locked and loaded their ACRs, picked their nifty call signs, and
said \'OK, if that\'s the way you want it....\' and now they\'re on
a mission from God recover old Imperial technology, because they
can use it better than the people who own it."

And that last part isn\'t a caricature at all.  Reread all the 
first-person "atmosphere" passages and the "historical commentary."

Historian 1: "They were killers, MURDERERS, Ravagers!"

Historian 2: "True, but so what?  They won, didn\'t they?"

If the RCES saw themselves as the heirs to the legacy of the
Imperial (spit on ground) scout service, would they view the
Wilds as "diseased", to be cured with "star-hot plasma, RAM
grenades, and coherent light"?

What\'s the title of the first TNE published adventure (slated for
release next month)?  "Smash and Grab"  Real idealistic, real heroic.

What was the name of the RC sourcebook BEFORE they changed it to
"Path of Tears"?  According to the promotional flyers from last year,
it was originally going to be called "REAVERS".  You remember
who the Reavers were, don\'t you?  Organized raiders plundering
the leftovers of an interstellar collapse (the Long Night), vultures
feeding off the carcass of a dead civilization.

So don\'t point to PoT and say "see, I was right and you were wrong".
I\'d be willing to put money down that the year\'s worth of grumbling-
to-outright-hostility woke GDW up to the fact that the RCES had 
a wee bit of an image problem, and that had some effect on how
things were presented in PoT.  They sure as hell changed to
title to something less bloodthirsty.

I think the ratio is more like 80-90% legit and 20-10% carping.
A lot of these changes have been done through some pretty 
ham-handed rewriting of some tried-and-true Traveller concepts, 
like the absolutely, positively, 100% unbeatable and unforgable
Deyo circut transponders, which even powers antagonistic to the 
Imperium bought and installed on their ships, without a clue
as to how they worked.
  For people who LIKED the Imperial setting, the number and sheer
scale of the changes gave the feeling of a bull in a china shop.
The was a LOT for people to complain about.

However, some of us out here are trying to find reasonable
ways to mesh the old and new concepts together in a palatable
fashion.  With the TNE, FF&S, and BL rules as they stand I
don\'t think there are any fundamentally insurmountable hurdles to
that goal, but there are many, many, MANY niggling little points
that have to be looked at an clarified to figure out the best
way to that in a way that WORKS in ANY era, not just the New one.

And that, my friend, is why a lot of us are wondering about things
like if B class starports can make microjump drives, system defense
arangements with limited-thrust ships, and how the bloody HEPlaRs
work.

That may be fine for you, but that\'s not true for everyone.
I know the people I game with, and even if I don\'t care how
the maneuver drives work, eventually the players are going
to try something that will MAKE me care about it.
If you have a problem with that, tough.

And for a lot of people, it cuts off the kind of stories THEY
like to tell.  That\'s why they DON\'T like it.  Again, if you
think that\'s just obstinate griping, well, they don\'t like
your attitude either.  To each their own.

I\'m running two concurrent campaigns with the New Era rules; one set in the
Reformation Coalition circa 1201, and the other set in the old Imperium
circa 1106. In fact, I\'m running the "Secrets of the Ancients" series (Adv 2
"Research Station Gamma", Adv. 3 "Twilight\'s peak" and Adv 12 "Secrets of the
Ancients", for the newbies). My players are enjoying themselves immensely
after a somewhat rocky start due to rules glitches. One guy quit the RC game
because he was ticked off that his laser rifle couldn\'t penetrate the armor
of robots (the police bots from TNE), but everyone else uses slugthrowers,
so they did okay. The folks in the "Old Era" game really enjoyed "Gamma"; one
person, who has been into Traveller forever and has played that adventure
before said he enjoyed it more with the TNE rules.
   To Anthony K. Baggeley: I did not mean to seem critical of Twilight 2000.
I like the game quite a bit. It\'s just that, especially in the early modules,
there was no mistaking the fact that everything had gone to Hell in a
handbasket. It was depressing and downright sad at times to think of that
happening-which is the type of setting where heroes shine even brighter-when
you can convince people to play them. I also understand what you mentioned
about CP 2020 (another game I enjoy), and your comments about Cybergeneration
make me want to check it out. I don\'t mind "dark" settings unless they seem
hopeless. That\'s why I like TNE; the "phoenix rising from the ashes" bit
always gets me.
   Oh, and by the way; I am definitely ALLEN Shock. My name has appeared
with question marks recently on posts both here and on gdw-beta. My wife
lets me use her account to keep me off of more expensive long-distance
bulletin boards. Nothing compares to the Internet, anyway.
   Oh, and one more thing, while I have taken it upon myself to defend TNE
from it\'s detractors, I have both CT and MT, and still run CT from time to
time (like this Thursday night). Traveller in all  it\'s forms is far above
anything else.

     Well, actually, I can say that.  However, that\'s not what I said.
I wasn\'t addressing the software at all.  I was talking about the actual
_hardware_.  The confusion is my fault, though--I should have been more
explicit.
 
     What I meant was that the hardware (the computer itself) should
have developed in directions and to degrees that would leave doped
semiconductors far enough behind that they would be curiosities on the
order of Babbage\'s Analytical Engine.
 
     You see, the Virus was so insidious because it could _alter the
actual hardware that it ran on_.  In effect, it hardcoded itself into
the machine itself.  In this way, it emulated the effects of some actual
biological viri:  it invaded its host and immediately started altering
"DNA" (okay, processors and ROM analogs; the analogy still holds, I
think).
 
     Now, the Deyo series of adaptive transponders were, according to
published sources, based on semiconductor intelligences (lifeforms, if
your definition is flexible enough) discovered on the planet Cymbeline.
These intelligences were in turn based on chips from a crashed Solomani
starship.  (I believe this was in _Survival Margin_--unfortunately, I\'m
right in the middle of moving, so my books are boxed and in transit.)
These chips, in the unique environment of the surface of Cymbeline,
evolved into analogs of biological lifeforms.
 
     In the ensuing time (approximately 3000 years, if memory serves),
however, progress should have marched on and doped semiconductors should
have passed into obsolescence, replaced by newer and more capable
technologies (optical?  Josephson junction?  Nanomechanisms?  I see no
way of predicting).
 
     Now, am I asking too much of the development engineers?  I don\'t
think so.  Look at the development of technology over the past 70 years
(why 70? Well, my mother is 70 years old--I can ask someone *who is
still alive* about the development of technology over that period).  70
years ago (1924), commercial radio was still a novelty.  18 years later,
my mother was working for RCA installing radios in jeeps.  How about
computer technology?  I have *very* clear memories of hollerith cards.
 
     While useful, I personally believe that the Deyo series was really
too dangerous to be practical.  Implementing the transponders using an
obsolete technology *no longer used anywhere else* strikes me as an
excellent safety measure.
 
     Irony:  Too bad it didn\'t work.  ;-)  I seem to have broken a
spring in my disbelief suspension.  ;-)

Well, on a general level, remember CP means different things to
different people- it\'s all a question of attitude. So it might be
possible to get outcasts from society using the cutting edge of technology 
to fight the government or corperations at TL4. (hmmm, people hacking
the TL4 telegraph system using imported TL 7 laptops... that could be an
interesting planet to visit. I\'ll think about that some more...)

As for the "Cyber" part- IT, bionics and neural interfacing- yes Early
Stellar seems to allow reasonable bionics, but for the neural 
interfacing most Traveller material suggests TL12-13 as far as I can
remember, and even higher for the more advanced forms. Of course Trav
predates CP, so it\'s TLs don\'t reflect a CP view of technological
development, or even mention it.

You asked about governments- I\'d suggest that the government code has
always been rather flexible. You could probably have any code on a 
world with a CP background- or that 2nd Survey data might just be wrong.
I don\'t think it should stop you using any world that otherwise looks
suitable.

Population- yes, high population tends to be part of it, but consider
a lower pop world where the there is little living space, it could 
easily be as crowded as Los Angeles 2019 (the obvious CP example)

Would bionics be acceptable in the Imperium- it actually varies. 
Generally it\'s been said that there is a general distrust of any
cyborgs. It\'s worse in Margrets area, but people I know in HIWG
put a reasonable amount of such tech in Gush...ge (I cann\'t spell it,
Real Strephon\'s domain) and Dagudashagg, claiming they had less
of a cultural bias against it. Your choice on the Spinward Marches as
far as I know.

Organ Legging- not a large scale interstellar business. At least I\'ve
never heard it being mentioned. A lot of the high-pop worlds are so
high-tec they can regrow or clone most of what you need anyway,
working from descriptions of Medical Tech in Travellers Digest. It cuts
out a huge section of the possible market.
Just on-planet, or between a small circle of planets with the right pop/
technology balance it almost certainly happens. The Imperium is a big
place. 

Possible planets in the Marches?- well I know people have used Efate as
a CP background- high pop. and tech. low law-level, it certainly fits 
better than some.
CP in Traveller has the extra twist that people can import higher 
technology if they have the money- not common in most CP.

And don\'t forget that even the nicest POP A, TL G planet probably has
some mean streets...

Re; Traveller Background and Rules

David Johnson mentioned...
>This is really of interest to me.  One of the `failings\' of Traveller IMHO
>has always been the focus on combat skills - hence the expanded character

Yes, the rules really do a background works out in play. Traveller has a
lot of combat skills and equipment, but it\'s rules tended to make combat
VERY lethal to balance this out a bit. TNE makes combat less lethal for
the PC\'s (if you play the rules as written) so you would expect it to
be a more combat-heavy background, and nobody has argued that isn\'t the
case. 
 One RPG had a whole chapter and set of stats devoted to character
interaction (NON combat) rules and that was the very bloody "Freedom
Fighters".. by J Andrew Keith (so it does have some connection to
Traveller...). There might be others. It\'s an interesting idea. I was
recently trying to work out a GURPS Space background where humans had 
no access to firearms at all- they were considered too violent to be
trusted. I gave up- players would hate it...

 Would you be willing to see "real news" from the same newspapers

 some possibilities toward creating scenaria.  They were written
 during MT, as were the adverts I sent you before, but there really
 isn\'t anything that would preclude their use in CT or TNE...  Let

Here\'s an extended review of "Path of Tears", the RC sourcebook,
for those of you who are wondering if it\'s worth getting:

Price: $18 (US)
Length: 158 pages

Sections:

THE COALITION:
Pages 6-8 are mostly a reprint of the RC timeline, though some 
parts have been expanded and more detail added.

Pgs 9-11 list the original 12 ships sent out by the Dawn League,
with ship name, type, sceduled course, and fate to the extent known.

Pgs 12-13 are maps and UWP data for Aubaine (ex-Nicosia) and 
Oriflamme (ex-Sarid) subsectors.  Each world has two lines of 
UWP data, first the pre-Rebellion and then the New Era stats.
On the maps, the pop code and tech level have been added to the
traditional map symbols in order to reduce the need to refer back
to the code listing. [I\'ve been doing this on my home-grown maps for 
years. It doesn\'t really clutter things much, and it really helps
having that information available at a glance]

14-15 is a breif description of each world within the RC
16-17 is an overview of the RC government, such as it is, as
well as a table listing each world, its population, political
bloc it belongs to, and number of representatives in the Assembly.

PEOPLE OF THE COALITION:

Pgs 18-19 breifly discusses the eight major political issues
within the Coalition, most of which are actually matters of
the internal structure of the Coalition, rather than matters
focusing primarily on the univers outside the RC.

Pgs 20-23 gives the "typical" views of persons from each of the 
RC\'s major worlds on the Coalition itself, the other member worlds,
and the aliens within the Coalition (the Schalli, native to Aubaine,
the Hivers, and the Ithklur).  The section preface _does_ emphasise
that even though these views are "typical" for each world, 
considerable diversity exists and the views are _not_ universal.

Pgs 24-27 detail the Schalli, an aquatic minor race native to
Aubaine.  One of the Challenge "swimsuit issues" featured 
a piece by Rob Caswell titled "First Contact" which showed
a human woman with an unidentified aquatic species.  That race
is the Schalli, and the woman is presumably the author of the 
"atmosphere" passage on page 24.  Templates and modifiers are
given for both NPC and player Schalli.

Pgs 28-29 is a glossary of RC jargon, about half of which appeared
in Survival Margin.

RCES OPERATIONS:

30-33 outlines RCES mission types, doctrines, and general tactics.
It includes a pretty absurd sidebar of the RCES studying the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan as a "classic model of invasion planning
and execution." [I say "absurd" because surely, from the RC 
perspective, there are thousands of more recent examples of the same 
thing]

34-35 outlines the defensive (ground, wet, and COACC) forces oef the 
coalition, and their orginization.  Sidebars on RC rules of 
engagement and informality among ranks.

Pgs 36-38 list the ships available to the RC, with tables of ships
complemented by text explainations.  Incidentally, some errata from
Brilliant Lances is dealt with here.  In BL, the Aurora-class 
clippers were capable of jump-5 in some configurations, even though
their TL-12 design should have limited them to J-3.  Here it states
that SOME Auroras (the so-called "Group III" ships) used salvaged
TL 14 & 15 equipement to extend the Jump performance.

Pgs 39-43 deals with the economics of the RC and the Auction(s), both
in general terms and in player-level terms (their cut from the 
auction, etc.)

THE AO (AREA OF OPERATIONS):

Pgs 44-45 is an overview of RCES objcetives for the next 5+ years
(pretty ambitious. I _REALLY_ hope they have their timetable
extended due to circumstances beyond their control).

Pgs 46-49 are player maps of Promise (Diaspora L), Khulam 
(Diaspora P), Thoezennt (Old Expanses I), and Shenk (Old Expanses J)
subsectors, in the same format used for Aubaine & Oriflamme.  Outside 
of seven parsecs of the RC proper, however, only pre-Rebellion UWPs 
are available.

Pgs 50-87 gives maps and world data for 19 Wilds worlds.
[some of these worlds have appeared previously in FASA\'s old
HIGH PASSAGE magazine #5. I didn\'t notice any overt contradictions,
especially given the changes between the Imperial and New Eras]

REFEREE\'S INFORMATION:

As indicated, Pg 88 starts the referee\'s section of the book.

Pgs 88-91 are general GM advice. Sidebar on the distinction between
Free Traders (the people, capitalized) and free traders (the ships,
lower case).

Pgs 92-97 are notes and rules on detailing worlds. Rules for 
determining the size and number of surface nations on balkanized
worlds, traits of governments (as opposed to types), types of
salvagable equipement, size and composition of military forces.
[I suspect much of this section will be reprinted and perhaps
expanded in the world-building book due out later this year]

Pgs 98-141 is Ref\'s data and notes for the subsectors and detailed
worlds.  Lots of adventure "nuggets" for a GM to expand upon.

Pgs 142-143  more notes on the Virus for a GM, with warnings
not to overdo it. Also, perhaps strangely enough, admonitions
not to treat Virus as a "disembodied intelligence" but to remember
it has to use things (cameras, sensors, etc.) to find out what
what the PC\'s are doing.

Pgs 144-145 introduces The Star Guild, a loose organization of
Free Traders in and around Diaspora.

pgs 146-153 gives stats on personal equipement and vehicles

154 details the Manta-class skimmers
155-157 reprints as well as expands the information on the
Aurora clippers from what was presented in BL.

Finally,
158 is an index, which, at first look, seems pretty complete.

IMHO, in terms of format at least, this is probably the best 
Traveller sourcebook published _ever_. (now if only they\'ll
do one on an area that interests me more than the RC :-)
It lacks any central adventure, which has been a feature
of Traveller campaign sourcebooks from The Traveller Adventure
up to Flaming Eye and Knightfall, but makes up for it in providing
details and nuggets for a wider selection of worlds.

The RCES still have a high emphasis on militaristic operations and
technology salvage, but there\'s more information for GM\'s to
create adventures that depend on more than the players\' arsenal
and weapons skills.  Adventures dealing with intrigues WITHIN
the RC, heretofore suffering from an information blackout and
depending entirely on the GM to cook up everything, are now 
possible for GM\'s that won\'t/can\'t/don\'t have the time to do
EVERYTHING themselves.


It may not be worth the price for everybody, but it\'s
definitely worth a close look.

Hello

I\'ve been lurking around here for a while, rules bashing and nit-picking
are not all that inteesting it can sometimes help. My Campain is changing
to the T:TNE rules. As they seem to be better and more playable than MT.
Although We are not in the NEW ERA yet ( 1122 ). We are playing in the
interesting times leading to the Arrival Vengence and beyond.
I have been devloping some of the Sons, daughters, And grandkids of some
of my characters. We also have some idea of how the history to 1130 will
be in the Domain ( Regancy ). Two others of my players are also on here
so I wil have to be careful what I say here. We have thought a lot about
the Zhodani James Kundert is the most knowageable about them Catie and I
One of the things I have considered is that the Consulate is indeed larger 
than the Domain and there are some political hard-liners who want to absorb
the Domain, Some "Liberals" who want to become more economic pardners of 
the Domain partially because of the ecnomic doldrums after the 5th.
also they realize that to absorb a chunk of realestate like the Domain
whould be tough and hard on the consulate\'s econimy as well as the former
Imperials would fight to the last Sophant, in the middile are the moderats.
who want to see things stay the same. The Consulate is VERY conservative.
Some of the liberals are beginning to realize that there is a danger of 
stagnating. James ? I don\'t know if you agree, but I\'d like to see it 
discussed.
The Vargar are an important force especally near the Corridor borders.
then there are the Aslan that situation is easy to straiten out Hire 
them to help with the Vargar problem. " If you have a lot of problems,
it is amazing how they will solve each other. " ( mis quote of Piper ).
There are some of the characters who are clostly involved in all of this
as two of them grew up close to Norris one and her husband where Countess
of Regina and as such she became one of Norris\' closest advisors and most
trusted Admirals. One fo the others is a Baroness and one of the Richest
Woman in the sector she also is a chaired professor at the university of
Regina at the Kingsbury Campus ( History ). She is blind and has a hobby
that even her friends won\'t know about until she " dissapears " in 1125
She finds and kills Ine Givar terrorists. She is also a very strong and 
subitle Psi ( very under cover notice the subtile ;-) ).
These are the some of the people who in our history will go on the first 
combined Domain - Zhodani expidition into the core area. They had a vision
and " Saw " these people there.
So this is some of our set up. And some of the characters who will 
influence them.

The present Group:

Marcus: Ex scout, ships Captain, First pilot, He doesn\'t have very many 
        secrets, only his " Purple Colon " ( an accident with a hard 
        Naval Vacc suit. )

Astrid: Ships Purser, Beautiful, and into making money, Their present 
        Gig is the keys to the bank as far as she isconcerned.

Blasnie: Short Green Aiain? Ships engineer agood on although prone to 
         talking about shoveling hydrogen into the engins and practical
         jokes. He is very secrative about his past except when confronted
         by a doctor he calls them vivisectionsts and complains about his 
         buddy Ziplock. ( Anyone Recall Spaced Invaders? :-) )

"Doc Trank" He has a name but he is called that as he was prone to trank
            the original ships Captain ( Thats another story and as the 
            player lurks here, I can\'t tell it here ) ex army soemtimes 
            tweaks out.

Amelia Redrock: Engineer and second pilot ( she is a better pilot than 
                Marcus but she isn\'t saying anything ). She is a Raccoonid
                She doesn\'t have any strange secrets she just likes life.

Flak:        It\'s not his real name, The players had him figured out almost 
             immediatly, But the characters haven\'t although if he keeps 
             being under stress he will blow his cover. Ships Security. 
             He is a Zhodani Guards Tvarchedl\' who had a mission into the 
             imperiam and is now doing research into the Imperial mindset. 
             He is unknown to him, known to INI. And his superiors and 
             Ini are talking.

Gunner Cade: Gunner was hired om to run the ship\'s guns and teach Astrid and
             Flak how to run them themselves. The Crew think he is a retired
             Marine Sargent. He is accualy a Brigider General and in INI NOT
             retired he is there to observe Flak ansd help him, sonetimes 
             it is hard to keep flak\'s cover...

Doug         Marine Frist Leuitenant still in the service he is the demolitions
             expert. He also is the other Marine\'s Bat man.

Maghs:      This is a nick name he is a Vagar who is on active service and  
            on loan from the 49th. he is another Brigader General. His Idea
            of covert seems to the others to be a little obivious he just 
            covered his rank insitnia. and they have accepted him as just
            a Gunbunny ( he is not...) He has soem more secrets but I can
            not discuss them here... He and Gunner have known each other for
            years...

            Well thats a capsule discription of the characters.
next time I can discuss some of the campain as I am takeing up to much 
band width. The Group, after the guest GM finishes our prsent op seems
to think that Disappering for a while would be a good idea. So they are 
thinking of going into Foreven Sector ( They don\'t realize that they are
taking a member of INI with them [ if he/they Survive]).

James I hope I haven\'t showed too much see ya Sunday. Talk to you soon.

Good Gaming.

For Immediate Release March 22 1994

Frank Chadwick, President, Game Designers\' Workshop, Inc.

TSR Acquires Dangerous Journeys Game System

Bloomington Illinois -- A two year lawsuit involving the rights to the
Dangerous Journeys Multigenre roleplaying game recently came to a conclusion.
On March 18, TSR, Game Designers\' Workshop (GDW), Omega Helios, Trigee
enterprises Corporation, and Gary Gygax jointly announced all rights to the
game system were acquired by TSR.

The specific terms of the settlement are undisclosed, but all parties are
satisfied with the amicable agreement. According to the parties, GDW will
cease distribution of Dangerous Journeys game products as of April 1, and TSR
will receive the remaining inventories.

The parties said the tremendous amount of time, money, and energy expended on
this lawsuit have left the gaming industry immeasurably poorer than it might
have been otherwise. However, the ability of the parties to negotiate a
mutually acceptable settlement allows the parties and the industry to
coalesce and move forward in positive and constructive directions with all
parties working together.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


    It doesn\'t take a computer called Deep Thought to see that GDW may be
able to focus even further on its flagship system now, though it\'s a shame to
see T$R\'s heavy-handed tactics win again. 
    Further thoughts or opinions?

Only joking - please don\'t bother to reply, I just happened to have a slow
day at work... :) :) :)

TNE?

I don\'t give a monkey\'s either way because I refuse to shell out my hard-
earned (?!) cash for TNE - when a friend gets it I\'ll copy any _bits_ I
find useful (possibly character generation and the use of d20s for combat,
etc.) but I don\'t want the complications of teaching my relatively new
group of players a new rules system AND background AND redetailing all the
equipment on their character sheets AND announcing that their beloved
characters are all 105 or older in this new game (probably 120+ since the
Rebellion hasn\'t yet happened in my universe)... etc.

And FF&S... well, I\'ve not seen it (cash problem again). And I openly admit
that there\'s nothing I like more than designing the odd starship or robot.
But I don\'t want it any more complex than MT\'s rules - anything more and you
seem (guessing here) to need a computer program or a free weekend to generate
one ship and a new pistol (and you still can\'t build robots unless you\'ve hung
on to the old CT, etc. stuff...)

BACKGROUNDS

Okay, TNE\'s got a new background. See my post earlier this week for why you
don\'t need a new background - CT or MT could provide every possible adventure
you ever dreamed of.

\'SOFT\' SKILLS

There\'s been some discussion about non-combat skills and increasing their
usage. I get my players rolling for skills such as Carousing, Liaison, Admin,
Interrogation, Broker, Legal, Trading, etc. almost every time they speak to
someone. Some people are born bright and come up with brilliant conversation
that means any NPC will reveal information to them. Some people are verbally-
challenged and have to rely purely upon these Traveller skills. Either way,
unless the player really knows what\'s going on (impossible in my games) he
may get an answer but still no understand its implications. Okay, so the
NPC said the Volcans would be in startown now. So what? I don\'t volunteer
information unless it would be naturally obvious, but if he says ok, what
does my character know, he gets a Trader roll. Ah, so the Volcans always turn
up at this time of year with huge shipments of semi-precious gems...
Isn\'t that what\'s sitting in our cargo hold?... So prices will fall, eh?
Time to sell (start rolling admin for the paperwork, Broker to find a suitable
buyer, Trader to get a good price...)

There\'s a use for all the skills, you just have to force your players to use
them... if you always tell them everything, then they won\'t bother.

Perhaps a trade with the Volcans? Anyone get Xenobiology or possibly Scout
survey skills? Ah, they particularly like orange-flavoured chocolate and the
scent of rose petals. Achmed, buy 10 kilos of rose petals and shove them in
the air filters. Pauline, shove the remaining petals down your blouse - oh,
sorry, flak jacket - and go invite the Volcans aboard. Janis - buy up every
bar of orange chocolate in the starport... Let\'s talk business...

COMBAT SKILLS

Combat IS dangerous. Okay, so the players are the heroes - they have to be
to have a chance of surviving. After all, take Predator, Terminator, Total
Recall, etc. There are good guys, bad guys and heroes. The bad guys gun down
the good guys and are, in turn, gunned down by the heroes. Unless the players
want to change characters regularly, there is no other way of running things.

As I\'ve pointed out before, there\'s no reason why players should expose them-
selves to to much danger anyway. The majority of planets in the Imperium
seemed to have pretty high law levels anyway, so the majority of the time
guns shouldn\'t be involved.

Not that players shouldn\'t die! If Gumbo, unarmed and unarmoured, wants to
take on the gook with the SMG, use him as an example to the other players.
But even then you needn\'t kill him...

Janis dived into cover behind a parked vehicle, but Gumbo charged the man,
head down, roaring ferociously. The gook\'s eyes widened for a
fraction of a second and Janis tensed, waiting for the withering hail of fire
but instead there was just a short burst, scream and thump. She peeked out,
nervously, expecting lead death to meet her. But the gook was standing,
ignoring her, watching Janis writhing in agony at his feet. Blood spurted
from the man\'s lower leg and he clutched at the wound in a futile attempt to
staunch the bleeding.

The gook looked up, just smiled at Janis. He knew she had no gun, no armour.
The SMG wiggled, inviting her out of her hiding place. She acquiesced, having
nowhere to run to; walked slowly toward him, gauging the distances. Still some
metres away he signalled to her to lie down. She did so, sprawling at a
calculated angle. He would deal with her in a second, but for now he would
enjoy his victim\'s pain. The snub-nosed SMG rested against Gumbo\'s forehead...
but his eye was distracted by Janis\' ample figure, exposed as she lay nearby.
The fool could wait - the SMG swung and knocked out Gumbo. Time for a little
enjoyment.

He lay the SMG down out of the woman\'s reach, pulled a knife from his belt and
held it ready in one hand. "Don\'t try anything, love, or it\'ll go badly for
you..." She whimpered, barely moved as he rolled her onto her back and spread
her legs apart from slow, deliberate movements.

The pain in his groin after her kick was as nothing to the whiteness which
exploded in his eyes when the dual knife-hand thrusts to his eyes and throat
drove him into unconsciousness. Janis rolled easily to her feet, pulled the
knife from his twitching hand and slit his throat.

Checking that there were no passersby, she picked up the SMG - that would
come in handy as she hadn\'t managed to smuggle any weapons onto the planet.
Gumbo groaned... she thought for a moment about leaving him, after all he\'d
spent most of the previous week saying how her unarmed combat skill would
never help her - she should rely on his handgun expertise and concentrate on
cooking, etc. on the ship...

Oh, what the Hell, she decided and helped the barely conscious grunt to his
feet. No point calling the cops, perhaps a private hospital would deal with
his wound without asking too many questions... given sufficient cash...
She dropped Gumbo unceremoniously floor and turned back to the corpse. Good,
a full wallet...

 ... OK, so some referees might just make the bad guy panic fire at Gumbo then
roll a couple of grenades at Janis. Does this ever happen to Harrison Ford,
John Wayne or Arnold Schwarzenegger? Nope, the bad guy would always fall for
the meek beautiful woman approach, guaranteed, every time (that\'s why all
my players have Charisma as an attribute after Social Standing; "God, he\'s a
handsome man!" "Yeh, but he eats like a Vargr and washes once a year..."

IF all your players want to do is heft weapons, then they should be
Mercenaries - and that doesn\'t tend to be a long-term career. If they want to
develop their characters then they need to learn the \'soft\' skills [and you,
the referee need to make sure they thave the reason, and opportunity to use
them].

Time to stop warbling...

Traveller material from the Challenge where I scrounged new ideas for my  own
game. I have to say that I respect the Imperial history, in fact I\'d like to
know even more so I could use it in my RC campaign.

If anybody haven\'t answered to you already about Regency, RC(ES), Star Vikings
terms, here it comes. Regency is in Deneb and beyond, RC (Reformation Coalition)
is in Old Expanses sector. RCES is RC\'s exploratory service. Star Vikings
are those relatively independent people who work for themselves and/or for
RC. Comprende?

In fact although I criticized TNE\'s background a bit I don\'t mean that I don\'t
*like* the setting. It is true that it allows PCs to interact with their
surroundings the way that affects whole RC and known universe! I remember
that someone had the Universal Universe Profile (or something like that) idea
here in tml, in that TNE has greater number than CT/MT in which indicates 
how much PCs can alterate their universe. I\'d like to hear more about UUP.

At first I thought that TNE is Twilight:2000 goes Traveller, but it is true
that TNE has more optimistic attitude that T2000. I can\'t wait to get my 
greedy fingers to that Path of Tears, it sounds like a good product for me.

Someone said that it takes lots of time to gather that much army to control
large area. It is true if you are talking about unsettled area, but in the
Wilds there is lots of people and when a planet joins RC it adds it\'s own
army to the RC\'s whole army.

And if Rodge would like to continue his journal/novel about that adventure
I\'d be very happy, I think it was great.

I have to admit that I like more about that background discuss than that
rules vs. reality when it comes to things that are relevant in TLs over our
own (i.e. ftl ships). But I\'d prefer the kind of discussion which helps to
better one\'s campaign and give new ideas of adventure because as someone said
Traveller = ADVENTURE, I second that!

After reading Path of Tears, one thought that hit me

With all the tech 3-10 carnage taking place and all
this balkanized worlds shooting it out. A fella in
a Tech 10 or 11 Merc outfit could make quite a living
out there selling his unit\'s service to various TED\'s
and other parties. Except, of course, that due to the
lack of space transport, that after the little shoot-em up,
the merc is going to be stuck on that dirtball world
as a chicken farmer. Which come to think of it, due
to the lack of Intersteller Govt support currency,
is probably what he is going to be paid off in.

Hmm, getting killed for filthy lucre is one thing,
getting killed for filthy chickens and pigs is
another.

Basically, is GDW going to fix this TNE universe up,
so that Mercs can make an honest living in the Wilds,
or are all those good strikers gonna have to emigrate
to the FASA battletech universe for employment<sounds
of upchucking, heaving, and wimpering in the background>?

How about this Merchant Guild, providing the transportation,
sponsoring, bond guaranteeing that the merc business needs
to live. I can\'t imagine Merc\'ing going over too well in the
goody two shoes RCES dominated areas.   

"Let me get this straight, your gonna help reestablish

On the other hand some of those oriflammie marines, seem to

Well, first I need to clarify some `timeline\' difficulties with my last
few messages.  For some reason my "TNE Background 4" (TML Msg 7032)
appeared *after* my "TNE Background 5" (TML Msg 7033) in Tuesday night\'s
postings.  And I messed up my posting in the second group of messages from
Tuesday.  TML Msg 7044 was also called "TNE Background 5" but should have
been "TNE Background 6".  Sorry for the confusion.

I at least have given up the comparison of TNE background to CT/MT in favor
of examining TNE since TNE, as a *fait accompli*, is all that\'s being 
supportedby GDW.  So far, the discussion has centered on the Star Vikings
of the Reformation Coalition since, apparently, that\'s the only aspect
of TNE background that\'s been presented by GDW in any detail so far.

I\'d still like to examine other aspects of TNE (and CT/MT and non-Imperium
background too) but I guess this is going to be dependent on those of you
who are brave enough to venture beyond the GDW scope.

For now, let\'s look at the Star Vikings.

How so?  An important aspect of Beam\'s original Space Vikings was that they
were highly individualistic and had a great deal of difficulty cooperating.
Much like the Vargr of Traveller, the Space Vikings were often fighting
among themselves.  This situation permitted some to be `blood thirsty
barbarians\' while others were more sympathetic explorers and developers.
(This situation was well preserved, almost to a fault, among the Sword Worlds
of the Spinward Marches BTW.)  In the novel, there was *no* Space Viking
political entity larger than a single planet and many Space Vikings operated
from balkanized worlds.

Does the political structure of the RC permit this?  Or is it a much more
cohesive and organized group?  The idea of an Exploration Service suggests
a greater degree of uniformity than was the case with the petty barons of
Beam\'s Sword Worlds.

Another interesting aspect of the novel was that some Sword Worlds detractors
of the Space Vikings saw them as a threat because they drew the best talent
and resources of the Sword Worlds away from home and into the `wilds\' of the
Old Empire.  The view was even expressed that Space Viking settlers in the
Old Empire might be raiding the Sword Worlds themselves in a generation or
two.

This is a *very* good point - especially considering the fact that grand
parents on these worlds remember days of *much* more advance technology.
Consider 20th Century Westerners in the developing world today.  They might
not be able to repair a laptop computer while exploring in Antarctica, feeding
the starving in East Africa, or building irrigation systems in Central America,
but they *certainly* aren\'t going to *worship* the darned thing!

Not exactly.  I doubt the Space Vikings are going to draw a line at the
atmosphere and wait for `permission\' from the UN to cross it.  I also
doubt the folks back home are the sort to start calling for the `boys\'
to be brought home as soon as some of them catch some flak.
And BTW, what\'s a `TED\'?  (I\'m guessing T-something E-something Dictator?)

Great.  So what\'s going on?  Your players, I assume, are RC explorers?  And
they\'re not chicken stealing?  What\'s your take on the organization of the
RC government and the issues I raised above?

Clearly there\'s some room for different interpretations of the role of the
Space Vikings - which isn\'t necessarily bad.  As has already been pointed out
previously, one of the strengths of Traveller has always been the lack of
clear distinctions between `good\' and `evil\' in Traveller - simple examples
being both the Zhodani and the Solomani.  An important issue though is going
to be the degree to which whatever attitude is predominant in the RC is
monolithic in it\'s support or not.  The more monolithic the attitude the
less chance there will be for both `good\' vikings and `bad\' vikings.

This is true, but as a referee I\'ve always felt that consistency is more 
important that adherence to any rules.  If the PCs discover some clever way
of dealing with a situation then the NPCs are just as likely to have found
a clever counter.  (Unless of course, you allow PCs access to *player*
knowledge, which can again be countered by allowing NPCs access to *ref*
knowledge!)  The point is *none* of us *really* knows how the maneuver drive
works (and much of the rest of the technology as well, especially the *jump*
drive).  Some folks are really into this sort of `imagineering\' and that\'s
fine, but it\'s not the sort of game I had in mind when I started this
discussion about background.

This discussion was started with a deliberate attempt to avoid rules-related
issues.  I know we\'ve seen where rules might influence the background but in
general I believe a good ref can avoid any major problems if her intention is
to stay true to background rather than rules and he still maintains consistency.

I suspect we\'ll get a lot of discussion now about the Reformation Coalition.
What about the rest of the TNE universe?  Who\'s adventuring in other places?

And I\'m still waiting to hear from folks that are still adventuring in the
Old Imperium campaign or who have gone on to even `bigger and better\' settings.

annoyed at the continual griping about TNE. Yes, the background has some areas
where science goes out the window. And I realize that, unlike myself, there
are people who care about these things. I guess I will just have to accept
that the TML is going to continue to be filled with this complaining for some
time to come. And yes, I WOULD like to see GDW correct some of these errors.
I have the feeling that as long as people keep coming off with the "you idiots
screwed up" attitude, they won\'t. Human pride is a funny thing. Mine led to a
more emphatic post than I probably should have written. Sorry.
   I had a great time running CT tonight, by the way. One thing which I do
agree with the anti-TNE crowd on is that the systems in TNE are more "wargamey"
than the original. I try to simplify things where possible, and put a CT-like
emphasis on the scenarios I run. I WILL say that my opinions regarding the
Reformation Coalition were fomulated from reading the very same material in the
TNE rulebook and Survival Margin that you referred to. Proof, I guess, that two
people can read the same work and see it two very different ways.
    I\'m going to bow out of the TNE vs. CT wars at this point, because I enjoy
them both.

  Take a closer look at that Crunch Gun (a.k.a Guy\'s Gun) and the Panda light
tank.  A sniper can penatrate the armor, except the front, using ball ammo
out to 1200 meters.  Use the DS ammo and you can score crew hits, through
the front armor, from over a kilometer distant.

  The Free Traders can keep brush fire wars going this way.  Why?  It\'s good
for business.  You sell to one side, your partner sells to the other.

  FT Bob sells Panda\'s to TED Zeke cause Zeke has more valuable stuff to 
trade.  FT Charlie sells Guy\'s Guns to Rebel Leader Yolanda for stuff RL
Yolanda steals from TED Zeke.  FT Bob and FT Charlie meet up later, count
the loot and have a good laugh over their beers.

  Of course the FT\'s don\'t want the RCES coming in. Not only do they want
to spoil such little profit centers, but the next thing you know...
Ya got port fees, export tarifs, import bans, fuel taxes...ugh!

  Given the limited RCES resources, the *last* thing they want to do is get
involved directly in a Planatary war.  They may have TL 12 stuff and the
zips got TL5 or 6, but the zips got lot\'s of their stuff.  The RCES have
to haul their stuff up a gravity well, through jump space and then down
a gravity well.  What do you call a grounded starship?  How about an
artillery target.... There is a reason why policy calls for decapitation
raids.  It\'s cheaper, faster and doesn\'t suck resources like a [insert
favorite methaphor].

Perhaps the net lost it, or he\'s on vacation.

Someone asked recently whether anyone was adventuring spinward of the
Spinward Marches.
 
HIWG Australia has been developing Yiklerzdanzh sector (the one
immediately spinward of Far Frontiers) for the last couple of years.  We
are hoping to get the various bits of work of the individual developers
drawn together over the next couple of months, with the result being
distributed in some form after that.  At this stage, it is expected that
adventures will follow.
 
We were hoping to have had things done by now, but drawing all the work
together, and getting missing bits filled in, is taking longer than we
wanted.  In computing, there is a saying that goes something like "The
first 90% of the project takes the first 90% of the time, and the last 10%
of the project takes the other 90% of the time". (I know there are
variations).  The saying appears to be true in the 58th century as well!
 
Also, has anyone noticed that type A Free Traders come with fuel
purification plants, now?  I have been having some correspondence on 
this.
 
This may well be different in the Empire of Deneb, but otherwise, this
is quite significant.  There is less reason to buy refined fuel, since
you can just buy unrefined for a fifth of the cost, and purify it while
waiting for your cargo to arrive.  If the world has water/ice
available, you don\'t even need to buy unrefined fuel.  It will also
mean that gas giants will be less useful, since it takes so much
longer to get there with the new drives (and time is money when
you are a merchant) and it is much longer and more dangerous to
refuel that way than ocenas/ice anyway.  Pirates will correspondingly find
lurking in gas giants less profitable (and more ships will be jumping-0
past them anyway, than in the past).

Since the trading rules seem to be otherwise unchanged from MegaTraveller,
characters will now be making much more money per jump than in the past.

I have doubts whether refined fuel being quintuple normal price is worth
while anyway.  I can imagine players using their own plant to purify fuel
for other people (they have several days waiting for cargo after all) and
making a mint.  The starport may not like the competition, though!

	A thought occurred to me the other day. How widespread is the
use of standard GalAnglic throughout what was the Imperium? I always got
the impression from CT that GalAnglic was a trade language as much as
anything and that many planets had their own languages - especially those
that were settled by Solmani of non-Anglophone extraction or Vilani.

	With the collapse of interstellar society as we know it, the 
reason for many people to know GalAnglic will disappear. The Syleans will
carry on speaking Sylean, Vilani will carry on with Vilani and the
Solomani worlds will carry on with a modern version of their old language,
be it Russian, Chinese, Swahili or whatever.

	Seventy years of not hearing from other planets will also do odd
things to those planets that did speak GalAnglic. Dialects will appear, 
and may become mutally incomprehensible. Think of all the differences
between American, Australian and British versions of English. They\'ve
all cropped up while we\'ve remained in contact with each other.

	Perhaps a good analogy can be drawn with the local situation here
in Wales. The fair county of Gwynedd has a population the majority of which
first language and the local culture thrives, having TV, radio, newspapers
and films in Welsh. (Incidentally, if you can, get to see the film Hedd
Wyn,  recently nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. It has no
sci-fi content at all but is a damn good film. Good for cultural detail
for those who appreciate such things). Anyway, I digress. The point is
that if Gwynedd were an island, it would have no need to speak English,
all the mod-cons of civilisation are provided in Welsh. However, they do
need to communicate with:

a)	The government in London which doesn\'t speak Welsh;
b)	The world at large which doesn\'t speak Welsh;
c)	People like me who have moved in and (as yet) don\'t speak Welsh.

	Thus I tend to hear more English spoken than Welsh since in town
it gets used as a Lingua Franca. Out in the mountains things are a little
different.

	If England were suddenly removed from Wales (i.e. instellar trade went), then the majority of people would probably get on with their lives - but now
have no need of English. The local TV and radio are in Welsh, the schools
teach using Welsh. English would die out, and fairly quickly too. People
like me would have to learn or become a small ghetto-ized community.

	I would say that this sort of thing would have happened all over
the wilds. Most of those planets will have at least a dialect that is strange, and most of them a completely different language to that which the players speak. 

	" I see. Can anyone hear speak GalHispanic? No? Bugger!"

	Well that\'s all folks,

This message is in response to S_DMOODY\'s posting about his
campaign (Bun556 msg#7000)...
 
                        ----
                        Player Attendance
                        ----
 
I noticed that you stop play just because one player can\'t show
up.
 
I\'ve found two ways to get around this problem:
 
    1)  Convert the PC into an NPC in the player\'s absence.  Why
    let the absence of one spoil the fun of everyone else?  I
    find that this policy, stated in advance, works well in
    keeping the game going.  An absent player can give you
    general guidelines to follow in running his character, or he
    can turn his character over to someone he trusts.  One of the
    players in my campaign routinely goes into deep freeze and
    becomes his ship\'s frozen watch.  They\'ve only thawed him out
    twice in emergency situations, and once they wouldn\'t thaw
    him out even when the player was there!
 
    2)  Have many branches (or "time-lines"), with many player
    combos to choose from.
 
I use #1 above for EPIC adventures or for my MAIN branch.  If you
are running the Traveller Adventure, or the adventure series that
runs from issue #1 to issue #21 of The Travellers\' Digest, this
is what I would recommend.  Or if you have an ongoing branch with
fanatic player participation, then give your Traveller addicts
what they need.  There\'s nothing worse than a great adventure
that everone wants to play that just stands still.
 
The rest of the time, I use #2 above.  My campaign currently has
around 20 branches, any of which can be revived as circumstances
and player availability warrant.  Because there is a lot of combo
duplication, the branch is often chosen based on the mood
everyone is in, whether it be for bug hunting, piracy, twilight
zoning/dark sci-fi\'ing, solving mysteries, combatting, rescuing,
treasure hunting, exploring, trading, or just plain high
adventuring.

                     ----
 
I like the characters you posted, and the food-fight in public
idea.  Sounds like a great way to introduce these characters.
They\'re first in line on my special encounters list, and I will
spring them on my players at my earliest opportunity, though I\'m
not sure yet what to do with the Zhodani spy ring plot.  I\'ll
keep you posted.
 
Thanks!
 
By the way, what happened to the characters on Wednesday?  And
what do I tell my players if they ask why that woman has been in
deep freeze so long?
 
 
                    May your travels be filled with wonder.
 
                    Rodge.

                               Mean to you?
 
 
 
 
I have a comment or two about the purpose and potential value of
the TML.
 
As I see it, the TML has 3 major uses:
 
        1)  Commentary/debate         (on rules, background, etc.)
 
        2)  General correspondance                ("Hi everyone!")
 
        3)  Swapping material for game/campaign use    (see below)
 
 
For what it\'s worth, my opinion is that even though #1 may help
to get the kinks out, and #2 may help to keep informed and to
track things down, #3 is the most valuable, because you can
actually use it in your gaming sessions -- the primary purpose of
RPGs is the GAMING EXPERIENCE ITSELF.
 
I see the TML as a Traveller material stockpile.  Over the life
of the TML, a lot of material (#3) has been deposited here (get a
load of the vehicles collection on sunbane!) between Traveller
refs -- BUT NOT LATELY.
 
Lately, almost all of the postings fall into category #1 and #2
above.
 
IF YOU\'RE A TRAVELLER REF LIKE ME, THEN MY GUESS IS THAT YOU HAVE
SOME OF, BUT NEED A LOT MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:
 
    Local settings
        Developed worlds
        Cities
        Towns
        Buildings/places to go  (stores, shops, offices, restaurants,
                    factories, museums, libraries, parks, etc.)
        Starports
        Stations/facilities
        Ancient Sites
        Wilderness areas
 
    Scenarios/adventures
 
    Encounters/events
        NPC\'s
        Ship encounters, complete with context
        Patron encounters
        Special events / situations
        Special encounters
        News items
 
    Aliens
 
    Cultures
 
    Organizations
        Governments
        Companies
        SIGs
        Associations
        Orders (of Knights, etc.)
        Etc.
 
    Robots
 
    Equipment and technologies
 
    Deckplans, maps, and floorplans.
 
    Flora/fauna
 
    (did I leave anything out?)
 
 
With 40+ referees with active campaigns frequenting this list
(see Derek\'s campaign survey posted a couple months ago), the
opportunity is ripe for some serious swapping.  If we all submit
the little custom material we have each developed, it will add up
to one HUGE collection of campaign material.
 
You can expect some NPC\'s from me within the week.
 
        I\'m looking forward to comparing material,

                  THEY CAME FROM BEYOND
                        episode 2
                  ----
 
It looked human.  And it acted human, at least until its cover
was blown and it was supposed to die.  Then it became an enraged
shrieking monster.  Now it was just standing there staring at
him, green ooze flowing down the front of its jumpsuit from the
many bullet wounds in its chest.  Baraka tried to wipe the tears
out of his eyes so he could see.
 
It should have been dead.  Baraka had unloaded an entire clip of
personnel-stoppers from his light but powerful ppz24 body pistol.
Those were special rounds designed to split into 4 pieces upon
impact, and to swivel off in 4 different directions when inside
the target, inflicting multiple internal injuries to the hapless
victim.  They usually dropped your opponent, unless he was lucky
enough to be wearing body armor.
 
It should have been dead.  It stepped forward toward Baraka,
whose back was pressed tightly up against the door.  It left a
puddle of thick green fluid soaking into the carpet where it had
stood.  Baraka\'s body surged with adrenaline, his heart pounding
so hard he thought it would burst.  His head darted back and
forth, looking for an alternative to dying.
 
It should have been dead.  Yet it spoke, it\'s raspy monotone
direct and to the point.  "Baaraaaka."  The voice had a very
strange but soothing quality to it.  Yes, there was something
about that voice, something Baraka couldn\'t quite put his finger
on.  Something about the way the tonal qualities blended, so
intriguing, so...
 
Baraka was distracted from his distraction by the pain in his
fingers.  He noticed that he was gripping his weapon so hard his
knuckles were turning white.  His arms were as tense as steel,
and he was pointing the empty body pistol in futility at the
approaching monster.  "NO!"  he yelled, standing still not an
instant longer, and dashed for the other end of the sofa.
 
"Baaraaaka", it toned again.  It began to walk around the couch
toward him.   Baraka could no longer think in words, his animal
instincts had taken over.  He just wanted OUT!  When the predator
was almost upon him, he ran along the backside of the couch,
making a mad dash for the control console.  He flipped the master
door switch with his forefinger and pressed the door button with
his thumb in almost a single gesture, and turned to go for the
now opening exit.
 
The alien had already moved to intercept and was blocking the
way.  There it was, death incarnate, standing in the middle of
his living room, with freedom in sight just beyond it but so
hopelessly far away.  In that moment, Baraka\'s gut-wrenching fear
of the evil thing turned to intense hatred.
 
"HEEEEELP!"  Baraka roared at the top of his lungs.  A thin smile
came to his face as he watched the alien at an impasse.  The
message was out.  If it moved on him, he\'d make a run for it.  If
it just stood there, help would eventually arrive.  Baraka felt
victorious.
 
The man who wasn\'t a man turned around, walked to the door, and
pressed down on the panel switch next to it.  Lying not far away
on the floor, was the other alien, whisps of steam rising from
the bloody corpse.  As the door began to close, Baraka held
down the button on the control console, and the door slid open
again.  The living alien turned around, its blood the same color
as that from the body on the floor.  Its face was contorted, its
mouth opened inhumanly wide, as if it were about to scream again.
 
The adrenalin surged again, and Baraka felt the urge to flee
consume him.  His head darted wildly around.  Baraka noticed his
bedroom door was still open.  He shoved off of the control
console with all his might and rushed to his room.  The alien
pursued, the apartment\'s front door closing behind it, and it
bellowed its soul-searing wail once again as it hunted Baraka
down.  The human was trapped.
 
Baraka hit the inside door switch as he ran into the bedroom, and
the door slid closed just as the screaching monster slammed into
it.  He whirled around to see that he was alone.  He could hear
the dull thunking of his deadly pursuer pounding on the panel
switch outside.  But it didn\'t matter.  He had pressed "privacy."
Now the thing had to go to the flat\'s master control console
before it could get in. Shaking almost uncontrollably, Baraka
backed away from the door, and made his way to the wall vent
where he always kept his body pistol.
 
The pounding stopped, but he could still hear the screaching
outside, although somewhat muffled.  It was already on its way to
the console.  Baraka frantically reached into the already open
vent and around the duct\'s first corner, and pulled out an extra
clip of ammo for his weapon.  It fell to the floor.  He dropped
to his knees, releasing the catch on the pistol he still gripped,
which held the empty clip in place as he fell to the floor. He
scrambled in a panic to retrieve the loaded clip as the door
began to open and the mind scream became infinitely louder.  He
could hear the thing thumping rapidly across the floor.
 
"Down to the wire!  Down to the wire!"  Baraka yelled, but with
much more ferocity than he ever did at the kluupa track, as he
struggled to coordinate his bony fingers well enough to get the
ammo into the damn gun!  As the screaming terror flew into the
room, its furious blazing green gaze meeting his the instant it
turned the corner, Baraka finally slammed the clip into place,
and involuntarily screamed as he raised the gun into the face of
the demon descending down upon him and fired away as fast as he
could pull the trigger.
 
The trusty weapon silently punched several holes into the alien\'s
human face, and the wailing stopped.
 
Baraka just laid there for a moment with the dead heap on top of
him.  A few moments later, as his heartbeat started to slow down,
he pushed the corspe partly off and yelled, "What the hell is
going on!"  Where the hell did Big Eddy get thugs like these?!
He had met quite a few aliens over the years, but he had never
ever heard of anything like these before.  He tried to push the
large man-like body off of himself, but he was so weakened by his
ordeal that he finally twisted over onto his hands and knees and
crawled out from under the thing.   He smiled, but then went into
convulsive fits of crying.  The tears streamed down his face.  He
was alive, it was dead, and he could barely control his bodily
functions.  It took him several minutes to get to his feet.  He
finally rose, staggered to the fresher, and looked into the
mirror.  He was all splattered in green.  He started to wash his
face, and a few seconds later he felt noxious.  He puked his guts
out until there was nothing left inside him.
 
After he had regained composure, Baraka sniffed loudly, and
finished washing his face.  He returned to his bedroom and
noticed that the skin of the creature he had killed minutes
earlier had turned somewhat green and was starting to peal off of
its face.  He nudged the corpse with his foot.  It felt rather
mushy under the jump suit.
 
Baraka felt the urge to vomit again.  He couldn\'t, so, with a
scowl on his face, he retrieved a fresh jumpsuit from his closet
and changed clothes.  He gathered a few possessions, including a
combination filter/air compressor mask, a breifcase containing
Cr60,000, and of course, his ppz24.  Then he left.
 
As he made for the front door, he passed the corpse in the living
room.  The skin had completely dissolved away, and what was
beneath it was becoming a big puddle of green ooze.  He slammed
the panel switch next to the door, and walked swiftly down the
hall toward the elevators.  As he passed the flats of all the
neighbors he had never met, he screamed "Next time, to hell with
sound-proof apartments!"

  The RC is governed by a representative democracy, with representation based
on population (although all planets are guaranteed one vote). There are many
sub-factions, but the two most powerful are the Centrist bloc, who are in favor
of a strong central government based on the Feudal Technocracy model, and the
Federalists, who are in favor of a looser organization which allows worlds to
develop their own social systems. In all, the RC is a fairly organized
governmental entity (at least for a relatively new government), It doesn\'t
sound at all to me like the "Space Vikings" of H. Beam Piper fame. (By the way
what\'s the name of that book? I\'d like to read it.)
  The RCES is an organized (although again loosely) group similar to the old
Imperial INterstellar Scout Service in some ways. It has four major functions
according to PATH OF TEARS, pages 30-31:
   DISCOVERY: Basic exploration and information-gathering. The Discovery
Mission Statement reads "Identify and locate key resources neccesary to
establish interstellar commerce." This is performed in two ways. Missions
codenamed "Stardust" are purely scientific missions, such as initial surveys
of systems or unihabited worlds. Missions codenamed "Moonshadow" are missions
of covert contact with intelligent inhabitants of a world for intelligence
gathering purposes.
   RECOVERY: "Secure and preserve those assets currently in the Wilds
neccesary to the establishment of interstellar commerce." These also come in
two brands: Cold Recovery missions, where the tech is abandoned or sentient
resistance is not expected, and Hot Recovery, where those who have the tech
want to keep it. All missions against TED\'s (Technologically Elevated
Dictatorships) fall into this category. These are the missions commonly known
as "Smash and Grab" missions.
    INTEGRATION: Actual integration of inhabited worlds into the RC. Quoting
from the book, "Diplomacy is the preferred means of integrating a world into
the Coalition". When the people like the government, and it treats them well,
the RC tags the planet TDO (Trade and Diplomacy Only), no SAG\'s allowed.
A Charismatic Dictator who was loved by his people and benevolent toward them
would not be overthrown.
    A second type of Integration method is Pacification. Only two worlds have
been integrated this way, but there will undoubtably be more. INteresting to
note that the Third IMperium (and the two preceding) engaged in this practice
as well. It\'s almost neccesary; allowing pockets of resistance within your
space would make as much sense as allowing Missouri to be an independant nation
in the middle of the US, especially if they were hostile. Admittedly, this is
distasteful (as I\'m sure it is to many within the RC) and I intend to stay
away from this kind of thing.
     REGENERATION is the final step; helping the worlds to rebuild their
technological base and reestablishing interstellar commerce. This is, as the
book points out, the major goal of the RC. Two operations are used here;
Commerce with Free Traders and RC merchants, and Bootstrap operations, where
the members function much as Peace Corps members do, helping the people relearn
the technology they need.

   I\'ll post later about our specific campaign activities; this post is long
enough :)

First of all, let me take this opportunity to thank David Johnson (a fellow
member of the prestigious \'djohnson e-mail address club\') for \'organizing\' the
general thrust of discussion...You, sir, are an excellent moderator!

On to other things...

1.  _Path of Tears_ ... This book has made me, in some ways, re-evaluate
the role that GDW sees for the RCES in the future.  In many ways (to me)
it strongly resembles the tone I\'ve seen developing over on the TNE
Pocket Empire mailing list.  That tone is one of empire building and the
forging of an interstellar government out of a group of loosely
cooperating worlds who face unknown dangers at their borders.

All well and good.  In many ways GDW should be proud of this sourcebook.
Again, to re-iterate, it would have made a fine \'beyond the frontier\'
sourcebook.

Specifics of the setting:  The Reformation Coalition consists of a
handful of worlds, each self-governed, who have a sort of loose
parliamentary government to handle \'interstellar\' details.  I haven\'t
read the sourcebook closely yet, but the feeling I get is very similar
to that of reading about the 13 colonies in and around the time of the
American Revolution.

Clearly, Traveller: The Fourth Imperium is the logical \'next edition\' of
Traveller.  Whether that will be in the form of the RC and the Regency
combining or what, I dunno.

2.  What\'s going on outside the RC?
	This is a fundamental problem with the way in which GDW is
choosing to support TNE.  The release of the Rulebook saw many shaking
their heads in disgust over the (rather spotty) ethics and modus
operandi of the RCES.  The release of _Path of Tears_ modifies at least
my impressions of them pretty heavily simply because I now have a
clearer picture.  My point?  I needed the Cr18 sourcebook to get an
accurate picture -- What was in the Rules was insufficient (at least for
me).  The Regency is the same way (as are the regions once held by the
Solomani, K\'kree, Aslan, and Vargr (mostly)) -- Until the sourcebook
comes out we won\'t know who Avery was, etc.
	Of course, in many ways, this is a basic marketing ploy on the
part of GDW, and a not-unfamiliar one -- To \'accurately\' follow the TNE
continuity will require several \'interlocking\' sourcebooks so that we
can see the whole picture.  Unfortunately, for those of us unhappy with
the region of focus at the moment, we are forced to develop our own
information in the almost certain knowledge that our carefully
rationalized explanations will probably not jibe with later published
materials.

	My general disgust with TNE would have been almost entirely
assuaged if GDW had chosen to remove all of the "New Era" specific data
from the TNE rulebook, a la the old \'Basic Traveller\'.  Rules and
Background can, in most cases, be safely divorced from one another,
especially in a game like Traveller where Background issues affect
people\'s enjoyment of the game.  Having only had the \'core rules\' in one
place and \'background details\' in another would have permitted me (at
least) to have developed a more accurate picture of the background GDW
was painting while enabling me to completely develop my own settings
without having to worry about weeding out the influences of the TNE
campaign specifics (I\'m here refering to the disparity of UWP gov\'t
codes for TEDs in the wilds <Oh, yeah TED = Technologically Elevated
Dictator> and the increased Crew requirements for ships in TNE due to
anti-virus measures).

3.  What I\'m planning on doing, in terms of background, is the
development of an Imperial setting away from the standard area but
during the Imperial era.  I\'ve picked Rim Reach as the perfect target --
Close enough to K\'kree, Hiver and Aslan space to justify their presence
on the one hand, and removed enough to not have to worry about published
stuff ever impacting me.  Also, I\'m going to put a Rosette system left
by the Ancients with a minor Human race on one world, a minor Vargr race
on another and some Droyne on a third.  This lets me get all the major
races in one spot, and I can say that, during the long night, the natives
of the Rosette system were contacted by some of those footloose Solomani
traders/exiles (a la Sword Worlds/Darrians) so that they now have jump
drive and their own hi-tech, politically stable \'pocket empire\'.

4.  The revelation of what exactly is behind the Black Curtain is going
to turn out to be on the same order as the revelation in _The Secret of
the Ancients_.  :/

  The following is the text of three stories that are in the local
  "starport rag" on the planet that my campaign is currently 
  visiting.  All of these are designed to be lead-ins to possible 
  adventures.  More to come...
  ----
  Liner Damaged Near Jump Point
    SKYSIDE - The Blaine Starlanes passenger liner Kleoptra was 
  towed back into port early this morning after being struck by an 
  object of unknown origin late yesterday as she approached the 
  outbound jump point.  The impact caused damage to the thruster 
  plates of the Kleoptra, and Captain Yelena Gaashurika advised 
  Skyside that she was aborting the jump, and requested assistance 
  in returning to port for repairs.  Neither Captain Gaashurika nor 
  any of her crew were available for comment.
    A spokesperson for Blaine Starlanes stated that "as per Blaine 
  Starlanes policy, all passengers will be accommodated at Skyside 
  at company expense until either repairs are completed, or a 
  replacement ship arrives.  Passengers wishing to transfer their 
  reservations to other carriers will be able to do so through the 
  Blaine Starlanes Skyside ticketing agent, at no additional cost 
  to them."
    Space Guard rescue teams have indicated that no traces of the 
  object have yet been found, but that examination of the damage 
  continues.  They have also requested that all Blaine Starlanes 
  vessels undergo sensor evaluation, but have refused further 
  comment at this time.

  Religious Riots in Bitra Kill 50 
    AVRIL, BITRA - A series of riots here over the past week have 
  resulted in the deaths of 50 religious fanatics.  The riots 
  started as a result of the destruction of the Joramite shrine 
  here by members of the Shudiri faith.  Police in Avril have been 
  ineffective in quelling the riots, and the mayor has asked the 
  Bitran Council of Suffetes to send in PDF troops to assist.  The 
  council is expeced to act on the request by 240-1129, and the 
  request is widely expected to be granted, accompanied by a 
  declaration of martial law and the imposition o a dusk-to-dawn 
  curfew.
    The Council of Suffetes has issued a strong condemnation 
  of the riots, noting that tolerance for all religions is 
  explicitly written into the Bitran Charter.  The riots have 
  resulted in the drestruction of some Cr25,000,000 to homes and 
  business, and losses due to looting are estimated at an 
  additional Cr2,000,000.
    The riots are viewed as a major blow to the reelection hopes of 
  the incumbent Liberal Democratic members of the Bitran delegation 
  to the planetary Assembly.  The Liberal Democrats ran on a 
  platform of "law and order - but with tolerance" in response to a 
  series of highly charged demonstrations just prior to the last 
  election, three years ago.  Since that time, religious and 
  political strife has continued, but has been kept under control.  

  Ista Down to Close
    ISTA DOWNPORT, ISTA - At a press conference earlier today, the 
  Starport Authority issued a statement stating that because of 
  the recent volcanic eruption and resultant ashfall on Ista 
  Island, effective 30 days from today, Ista Downport will be 
  permanently closed to all air, grav, and space vehicles with 
  displacements greater than 50 tons.  Ista down handles 15% of all 
  incoming space traffic for the planet, but the closure is not 
  expected to cause problems with shipping, as both Fort and Igen 
  Downports are operating below capacity.  It is expected that crew 
  displaced by the closure will be relocated to one of the other 
  starports.  Local travel into and out of Ista is not expected to 
  be affected, as the craft used for this purpose are almost 
  universally below the 50t limit.

  Nerat Plague Contained
    HALF-CIRCLE, NERAT - Health Service officials announced today 
  that the spread of the unknown plague in Nerat is considered to 
  be checked, but that the area is still under quarantine.  In the 
  past week, the number of reported new cases of the disease fell 
  to only 400, as compared to 650 the week before.  All of the 
  reported new cases are in the southern part of the peninsula, 
  where the disease was first reported.  The quarantine area is 
  designated as being all of Nerat peninsula south of Half-Circle 
  Seaport.  Half-Circle Seaport is not included in the quarantine 
  area.
    Travel into or out of the quarantine area is banned, except for 
  delivery of food and medical supplies, and medical personnel 
  engaged in plague-connected work.  The Department of Immigration 
  is cooperating with the Health Service to provide an examination 
  checkpoint at Nerat Plains Travel Center to prevent infected 
  individuals from leaving the quarantine area.  All other travel 
  between Nerat regional travel centers and Benden and Igen has 
  been suspended until further notice, and COACC, the PDF, and the 
  Coastal Patrol are turning back any unauthorized vehicles that 
  attempt to enter or leave the quarantine zone.
    The Health Service has refused to comment on speculations as to 
  the origin of the disease or progress toward a cure, except to 
  say that research is continuing.

help. And helping customers makes them want to buy more GDW stuff :) (Shameless

   Here is an idea on how to make crew complements of ships smaller, more like
the good old days of integrated computer systems. (DO NOT try this in the New
Era!) The Control Multipliers given for computers control how many crew are
needed for certain positions such as Engineering. We found, via experimentation
with High Guard, Brilliant Lances and a goat (OK, forget the goat) that of you
SQUARE the CM, you get crew numbers much closer to the CT versions. We were
actually trying to build a version of the Aurora Class Clipper for High Guard
(we were bored) when we discovered that the TNE version required 26 Engineers,
the High Guard version required 9, and if you squared the CM for a Tl 12
computer and plugged into into the formula for figuring required engineers, it
came out as 9. We tried this with the Azhanti High Lightning design that was
posted here (the one that requires over 2,000 crew!) and it seemed to work well
EXCEPT for gunners. So...
       RULES QUESTION:
   Can you put more than one weapon through an MFD, automate the turret rather
than have a physical gunner there, and call it a BATTERY? (This might be
something to consider for BATTLE RIDER...) If so, you could easily reduce the
gunners on the AHL back to the level given in ARRIVAL VENGEANCE, thus meaning
you don\'t have to conscript entire small worlds just to crew your ship.

   Some of you amatueur ship engineers here should try this out and see how it
works. If it DOES works it will be a help to those who wish to use the new
rules in the old setting. If it DOESN\'T...well, I\'m not a mathemetician.

I look forward to seeing this work.  How will it be distributed?

The idea of group development is also an interesting one.  How were
individual development tasks divided up?  I\'m especially interested in
how you `patched up the missing parts\'?

My take was that *most* Imperial citizens spoke Galanglic - if not as their
birth tongue then as a `good\' second language.  Good modern examples might
be Hispanics in the US or the Japanese - both groups that speak English as
a second language but for very different reasons.  This would be true on 
almost all worlds that were regular participants in Imperial society - say
Early Stellar tech levels and higher.  Less-advanced and backwater worlds
would have more divergent languages although here also those who interact
regularly with off-worlders would speak Galanglic.

IMHO, language skills have often been neglected in science fiction as a whole.
(Mostly because viewers or readers often only understand English).  The
*Star Trek* movies, with English sub-titles for Klingon and Vulcan, were
excellent exceptions, especially considering that *Star Trek* has been a 
`flagrant violator\' in this respect.

The key with language in the post-Imperial era (PIE? As in `in-the-sky\'?)
:-) is going to be who needs to learn the other\'s language.  Star Vikings
on Discovery, Integration and Regeneration missions will learn to speak the
local lingo while those on Recovery mission probably won\'t bother.  Folks
who want to interact with the RC, the Free Traders or the Regency will
learn whatever dialect of Galanglic that these various folks speak.  Certainly
by the time the Reformation Coalition meets the Regency they will have about
as much of a chance of understanding each other as an Australian sheep farmer
and a Mississippi moonshiner (or a New Delhi businesswoman and a Quebecois
hydroelectric engineer).

Who is represented?  In other words, who gets to vote?  Adults only?  Women

these decisions?  (And are the requirement for voting different from those

Hmmm, I always thougt a feudal model was very decentralized.  In a feudal
system each baron\'s authority is based upon the support of her vassals.  This
tends to keep power from being concentrated in a central authority.  A `feudal\'
system was what Alexander the Great and King Arthur had to destroy in order
to become the monarch (literally `single ruler\').  GDW alway got this wrong.
Lucan would have *never* been able to cow the Moot in a true feudal aristocracy.
(The Imperium was not a `technocracy\' because noble patents were not based
upon technical or economic abilities.  GDW didn\'t get this part of Piper\'s
Sword World\'s right either.)

> Federalists, who are in favor of a looser organization which allows worlds to
> develop their own social systems.

Okay, like the Revolutionary American Federalists.  Since the government is
described as `representative\' I assume neither the Centrists nor Federalists
believe in aristocracy?  Democracy, or some form of voting at least, is the
way to govern.  One wonders where these `progressive\' attitudes come from
(hasn\'t it been suggested that the Regency is more `democratic\' as well?) in
the ruins of a millenia of aristocracy?  Democratic traditions just don\'t
spring up over night, or even in seventy years, after that sort of history -
look at the former Soviet Union.  (How long has it been since the Magna
Charta?)  And the post-Imperial states haven\'t had a big democracy offering
financial incentives to make the move to democracy either.  Only in the mind(?)
of GDW . . . .

> In all, the RC is a fairly organized

Okay, which means the Star Vikings are either all `bad\' or all `good\'
depending on how you see the RCES defining it\'s role.  There won\'t be much
variation in the ranks.

> "Space Vikings" of H. Beam Piper fame. (By the way

It\'s *Space Viking*, but it, and probably most of Beam\'s `Future History\'
novels and anthologies are probably out of print.  Try the used paperback
stores.  They\'re all great reads.

Aren\'t *markets* the fundamental `necessity of interstellar commerce\'?
Doesn\'t this sort of preclude `chicken stealing\' of any sort?  (Whether I
call it `identification\', `location\', `preservation\' or whatever?)  Wasn\'t
the collapse of *markets* (and access to them), in GDW\'s own words, what
led to the collapse of the Imperium during the Rebellion rather than a lack
of resources?  (Do they ever read what they put out after it hits the stores?)

Okay, so `good\' Vikings only hit TEDs while `bad\' Vikings will take it from
you regardless.  Who makes this TED determination anyway?  The RCES?  That\'s
sort of like the 1950s CIA looking for commies isn\'t it?

And this is the US in Somalia (only RC citizens give a damn about folks who
aren\'t just like them and aren\'t squeemish in the face of casualties)?  Or is
this the Soviets in Afghanistan, which the RCES uses as a training guide?  With
a relatively stable, centralized government in the RC this `good vik\' - `bad
vik\' issue will have to be resolved.

Is this sort of like letting Exxon or Alcoa come into your country to help

Now this sounds benevolent but this has to come from altrusim - the RC won\'t
recognize any benefit (other than spiritual) from this sort of behavior for
decades.  My question is: do the TNE rules spend as much time explaining
irrigation network as they do explaning armor piercing rounds?

Some really important issues need to be decided here for the RC but there
seems to be a lot of potential too.

Maybe, but empire buliding is seldom very altruistic and often very bloody.
It seems to me there\'s a fundamental conflict in the goals of the RC.  Is GDW
trying to make the RC everything to everyone?  Should they?  And more
importantly, can they?  Is there the potential for a split between empire-
builders and altruisitc-developers?  It seems the internal structure of the
RC is more important to the Centrists, Federalists, and other blocs than are
these fundamental issues of how the RC will interact with the rest of the
world.

You can bet that by the time the RC meets the Regency each will have its
own interests which will most likely be in conflict.  Those who have
`rebuilt from scratch\' won\'t have any interest in turning over what they\'ve
wrought to those who stood by `holding the torch\'.  Now there\'s an interesting
conflict!  (And d**n, now I\'ve gone and broadcast it to everyone!)

Yes, but knowing Travellers, who would then have just bought the rules?
This is the one thing that GDW is *very* good at.  They know their customers
and how to get into their pockets.

Great!  Look forward to reading more about it.

So, some good stuff on the RC and a beginning of some `alternate\' Imperium
campaigns.  More, more!  And who\'s adventuring in the Regency?  What\'s going
on there?  Or do we have to wait for the sourcebook?  What about completely
original campaigns - don\'t have to wait for a sourcebook for those?

  One of my biggest complaints about Traveller, from Yom Echad
  (Hebrew: The First Day - the "ch" is gutteral) is that, for the 
  most part, Aliens were semi-cardboard cutouts.  The Imperium was 
  populated mostly by twentieth-century Terran Humans, mostly North 
  Americans from the United States and Canada.  The Zhodani were 
  the Evil Telepathic Dictators from Beyond the Rift, the Aslan 
  were the Honorable Samurai Warriors, the Vargr were the Inept 
  Anarchistic Pirates of Space, and the Solomani were the Evil 
  Communist/Racist Menace.  And any minor races we ever saw (the 
  Bwabs/Newts, the Virushi, etc.) didn\'t even get that much.  We 
  never really got a good look at their culture(s), or their point 
  of view of Interstellar History.  DGP\'s Megatraveller Alien 
  series was something of a step in the right direction, but not 
  enough, and the Third Coming killed the series after it was 
  barely begun.  What I\'d like to see is a set of Alien 
  Sourcebooks, one per race, not smaller than Hard Times or Path of 
  Tears.  (What I\'d really like is for each race to get as much 
  info as is in the TNE Rules, but let\'s at least pay lip service 
  to being realistic.)  This, incidentally, should include as many 
  of the Minor Races as possible.  I\'d accept Minor Races at two 
  per book, rather than just one, but I want that information.  I 
  want my players to be able to run Zhodani characters in 
  character, and to be able to adventure in the Zhodani Consulate.  
  I want them to be able to be Aslan in the vanguard of the 
  reconquest and recolonization of the Rimward portions of the 
  former Aslan Hierate.  I want them to face the problems of being 
  seven or eight feet tall, half again as long, and weighing 
  upwards of half a tonne, on a ship built around _human_ 
  dimensions, and _human_ needs.  I want them to see, as a Newt 
  would, how and why the ship\'s purser\'s attempts to bribe the 
  clerk are so extremely offensive, or why even the patience of a 
  Virushi could be exhausted after breaking yet another excessively 
  fragile human medscanner.  Most of all, I want them to realize 
  that there are a _lot_ of people in Known Space who are Different 
  From Them, but who are no more Alien than they themselves are.

For those who haven\'t seen previous discussions, TNE-Pocket is developing
a couple of subsectors of Reavers Deep sector as a set of Pocket Empires
for TNE, which GDW approved.  The current status of when we can publish
the stuff is up in the air, which Guy Garnett could (should? 8-) send an

Language:
	I agree that in many settings, not just science fiction, language
skills have been ignored. In sci-fi it most players would sooner carry around
smart translators (a step or two up from the electonic language dictionaries
of today). Of course, in a Virus campaign, they might not rely on such computer
enhancement. I don\'t believe in "universal translators" that can learn a 
language with just a few minutes of exposure, but translators that have a
database of existing languages to translate are, IMHO, wholly plausible.
	Introducing language to your campaign can also help you bring the
"cultural advantages" Jeff Zeitlin was looking for. If all your NPCs sound
the same, they\'ll all seem the same. If you can come up with accents or
other speech patterns common to a given race\'s rendition of Galangic, you\'ll
find the players remember that they *are* different from the other hominids
in the Galaxy.

Government:
	I don\'t own TNE stuff at all, and to be honest have never actually
*played* a Traveller campaign, so I can\'t comment on the RCES. However, I 
think a feudal technocracy can be either strong or decentralized, depending
on just how much authority the chief monarch asks for and is ceded. An example
would be the back&forth of State\'s Rights in the US, showing that at times
a rep. democracy can have either a strong central government, or a weak one.
A strong leader makes for a cetral power; a weak one allows his vassals to
do as they please.

Lucan *could* have cowed the Moot, if he had the backing. If Lucan had a great
deal of military power, whether formal or informal, or had a vast spy ring,
or simply controlled many resources, or was friends with many Moot families. . .
any of these factors could have made the members of the Moot look favorably
upon him - or at least enough that the Moot could not agree on action, leaving
a power vacuum which Lucan, through sheer force or will, was able to fill.

Examples would include many of the great dictators: Caesar, Napolean, and
Hitler. All of these men were able to seize power, usually legally, even 
though the were intimidating the people who gave them power. Civilization
isn\'t much different from street life: people with the backing will take
power. All the fancy laguage and sharp threads are just dressing.

Good vs. Bad
	As has been pointed out before, the cool thing about Traveller (and
many GDW adventures) is that there aren\'t really good guys and bad guys.
The Solomani, for instance, are agressive and often racist in their politics - 
but they also colonized and dominated most of space after defeating their 
rivals, who had them outclassed in numbers and technology.
	Anyway, the "Space Vikings" seem to be in a similar situation. On the
one hand, yes, they are using force to reclaim technology from other people - 
sort of deciding that if anyone\'s going to have it, they should - a philosophy
that makes sense in a strict "national interest" approach to foreign affairs,
which is likely to happen in the post-Virus world. However, you cannot deny
their success, and like it or not, they *are* bringing order to their patch
of space - 200 years down the road, many of the conquered planets will be 
*happy* to be RCES members, especially if it gives them access to tech from
dozens or even hundreds of worlds that would not have come together without
the RCES.

Of course, there\'s always Quebec :)

Democracy from the ashes:
	I don\'t think a representative democracy is too unreasonable, even if
the Imperium was an autocratic-feudal organization. Let me adapt something I
got from (I think) FASA\'s Battletech (blechh, I know):
	In a society as large as the Imperium, and with the travel time 
between worlds, sectors, and so on, it could conceivably become more effective
to have an autocrat in charge of government, at some level. I imagine that
in a more enlightened society that such a government would be a representative
monarchy - much like the British model circa the 17th or 18th centuries. In
other words, there is a parliament with legislative duties and the ability
to override the monarch - but the monarch is still in charge. Depending on 
the support of the people, the monarch may have great power, or be as weak
as the modern Royal Family.
	After the Virus, there would be many strong leaders, I\'m sure - but
after a time the "tribes" they lead would realize they had more to gain
by joing together, forming a - what\'s that wored? ahhh, COALITION! They would
then be democratic for a time, at least until they controlled an area (say, the
size of Norris\'s old stomping ground) too large to govern by commitee, at which
point a strong leader could step in and establish a new line.

Gunging Ho to Market:
	Yes, markets are needed for commerce; but when the RCES says "secure
& preserve" that means make sure they\'re friendly to the RCES. Just because
you\'re out to re-establish order doesn\'t mean you won\'t look out for #1.
	The collapse of markets may have come about during the collapse, but
I\'m sure 70 years is enough time for *new* markets to develop.
	As for Exxon and Alco coming in. . .the analogy may be valid. Better
yet, the Penn/Beads deal. AS history has shown, they have their good and
bad sides. :)
	Bootstrap: The RC *will* benefit in the long run, having new trade
partners that aren\'t directly controlled by the RCES. Sort of like the US
Peace Corps jobs.


Well, that\'s enough for now. I\'m babbling.

    'body' => ' I apologize in advance for the length of my ravings that follows but here is
my 2 bits worth re. background:

What plot feature does the Virus provide?  IMHO it is the same as with the
other game company with a 3 letter acronym using the Time of Trouble to
explain the transition to a new set of rules (in that case a change in spell
use, elimination of some character classes, etc.).  W. TNE the new career
procedure and planetary cmbt rules do not require a major transition but the
new maintainance, space travel (esp w/in system), and space cmbt rules are so
different that the Virus plot device eases (maybe) the transition to the new
rules.

Perhaps it was unnecessary to have Virus change the setting to the extent
that
GDW has done.  I feel that GDW has used the Virus to create a setting that
makes the most of the new system, esp. re. maintaining ships (particularly
old
ships) and travel within systems.

I have been playing Traveller for over 10 yrs (I even have read Book 0) and I
would like to have seen the continuance of the Imperium.  My dream setting
would have the Wars for the Iridium Throne last for 100-200 yrs, grinding to
a
halt with the release of the Virus.  The various factions would stabilize
with
control of areas of varying size that are separated by vast zones (some at
least a sector in width) ravaged by BOTH the wars and Virus which would be
similar to the worlds of the TNE Wilds.  Result: a situation similar to the
setting of TNE but w/out the (almost) entire elimination of the Imperium.
Each of the "civilized" areas would be supported by official products (to
varying degrees).  As an aside I don\'t think this would reduce the market,
TSR
has released many campaign settings and still supports a number of AD&D
settings, I\'d wager that the majority of Traveller junkies would buy all the
products even if they only used parts of each.

Despite my Imperial sympathies I shall play Devil\'s (Virus\'?) Advocate re.
why
a Star Viking (it does sound corny, I imagine Conan leaping from a ship,
hewing his enemies\' limbs w. a broad sword before carrying off women and
looted hi-tech booty) or RCES campaign might provide a more exciting setting
than a CT/MT Frontier product.
   IMHO the RCES does more than the IISS.  They explore unknown systems and
worlds,  seek people w. hi-tech items, make contact w/out irritating those
people, use diplomacy to open trade or aquire items of interest by other
methods.  This may include overthrowing dictatorial/opprerssive
rulers/gov\'ts.
   True the IISS could encounter many of these situations but the RCES does
so
w. less backup.  The available equipment is limited and often run-down,
making
it difficult (read more exciting) to accomplish missions.  They are also not
able to call upon vast reserves of men and material if a strong force is
encountered.  The Unknown - they face the possibility of stumbling across a
vastly superior force (Virus or sophont pocket empire) capable of not only
overwhelming an RCES expedition but of threatening the entire Coalition -
tension similar to the Borg attacking the UFP.  I submit that this did not
exist in Imperial campaigns as the Imperium seemed so vast that even the
Zhodani were only worthy foes but never did more than threaten part of a
sector.
   TNE has also added a wider array of antagonists, some of which may not
initially seem to be foes.  There are Virus controlled ships, fleets,
stations, bases, planets, and even groups of sophont
followers/slaves/hostages.  Added to this is the host of Vargr, Aslan, humans
of variuos sorts, plus other races - add to this a touch of the unknown due
to
the interval of lost contact.  There sense of security provided by the large
and seemingly unalterable Imperium is no longer available for characters to
fall back on.

Re: Languages etc.

I agree. I mean, here in England where we speak English (Can I get away with
saying \'properly\'? On a US-dominated list. Probably not. Damn....) in many
different guises, you only have to go the the deep south-west or the north-east
to hear an accent that you cannot make head nor tail of. And this is before
you take the other home nations into consideration (Wales, Ireland, Scotland).

I know that the situation in the US is the same, having friends from Boston,
San Fran., Texas, Nevada etc. How about Down Under?

Some people may argue that in a reasonably medium-high TL (3+?) culture 
where mass media is predominant, this dialect barrier will break down, and one
homogeneous lingua franca emerge. I believe this is not so. In the short term, 
take the example of Earth. In the UK we have television consisting almost 
entirely of British (SE England/London) accents and American accents from 
imported crime series, with the odd burst of Aussie soap at lunchtimes. Yet,
we have hugely different accents separated by only 30-40 miles. In the long
term I think accents/dialect is a social phenomenom rather than a geographical
one, and, as new youth fads with new buzzwords hit the streets every 5 years 
(minutes???) there is change - I cite the \'rave\' culture as one in point.

Surely then, if such differences can arise in such close proximity (both social
and geographical) then what happens when two vastly different communities
(one religious sect, one trading outpost) have a few hundred (thousand, 10,000)
years to mutate their language, even if sharing mass media?

I think when dealing with this, referees should be very careful - although it
does come down to realism vs. playability in some respects. However, an 
enterprising party should be able to devise the best strategy for translation
with some novel twists - Searching for old dictionary files, Automated equipment
with voder chips, speaking slowly and LOUDLY etc.!

However, it should be easier dealing with officials/ flight coordinaters/landing
permission bribees... Shouldn\'t it??

 ....no, I said land NEXT to the village, not ON the v.......

Ho hum. What else...ah yes.

Personal opinion, I know, but I am all in favour of campaign plot summaries -
gives me more of an idea of flavour CT/MT/TNE squabbling. More please (JP)...

(question perhaps that should be on Computer Aided Traveller...)

The Comment;

I agree with Rodger Sanger that the TML is a list I signed onto primarily
as a source of material.  I also would encourage (enthusiastically) the
other activities (something I think Rodger feels as well) as having their
own value and a place on this list.

To that end, have any of our talented programmers written starship design or
vehicle design programs?  Probably some are still in the making...

I am using Microsoft Excel and have (in about 6 hours of work) made a 
reasonably presentable small arms design template (conventional only)
and will post at least the test design in the next few days.

If anyone wants a copy of the Excel Spreadsheet Template (in Excel 3.0/windows)
just drop me a line.  The spreadsheet requires having FF&S to fill in some 
places, but does all of the formulae.

The Question;

Has anyone tried to use one of these home floorplan design programs to do 
deckplans?  I am considering laying out the $40-60 on such a product for just
such a purpose and would like a reccomendation.

Is it possible that we could come to some internal (to the TML) informal
standard which would allow al of us to exchange deck plans?  I have several
(all of the hand-drawn variety) which I am rather happy about, but have not 
been able to find a suitable medium for putting them in a computer.

The one program I have used is the inexpensive CAD program from IMSL (name
escapes me "something-cad").  Perhaps I am not suited to the controls, but
I could not easily reproduce accurately my starship design (in a reasonable 
amount of time).

Happy travelling,

Pete

DOn\'t just post, upload it to ftp.engrg.uwo.ca.  If you cannot, get
after me to do it for you.

Mark Cook has used a drawing program and come up with some of the best
deck plans I\'ve ever seen. Check out the Elissa, Alcyon, and other deck
plans on ftp.engrg.uwo.ca, under the pbem directory. Also there are a
few more in the vehicles directory.

The best image format, that the greatest number of people can view and
manipulate, remains GIF.  A far second is, perhaps, MS-Windows BMP.

IN the rules of BL it states that several turrets or barbettes can be
controlled by one MFD. And thus I would also find it possible to save in
on the crew count when it comes to gunners. With the FF&S rules I have
made a set of turrets and barbettes that are unmanned, but must be
controlled by a MFD. If there is interest in getting this list I\'ll post
it at a later date, either here or e-mail it to you. It is an "official"
HIWG document, and may be obtainable from Bryan Borich, or Clay Bush.

Anyone out there using Quattro Pro for Windows?  if so I have a
finished small arms design worksheet that includes CPR slug throwers,
gauss small arms and grenade launchers.  *Most* of the noticable bugs
are fixed but NO gurentees.  I beleive Excel can translate it into
smoething it can understand, if not I can try to port it over.  (This
is starting to sound like a practical problem for you language folks
out there :)) E-mail me privately ifinterested and I\'d upload it to
ftp.engrg.uwo.ca if there sufficient interest.

If so perhaps we should make available some shareware Gif/BMP viewers

My fervent hope (and its a hope as big as all of the RCES) is that someone

I believe most US people would not deny that the British speak "proper"
English. Retentively prim & proper, to be precise. Unless you\'re from
Liverpool. We have relatively local culture (British Columbia) which may
feel it is more "proper" than England!

> I cite the \'rave\' culture as one in point.

In Eugene we have a Deadhead culture (fans of \'The Grateful Dead\'), on
which there was a Linguistics article in the local newspaper. Dialects
seem to spring up spontaneously as a means to cohesively bond a group of
people together who do not wish to be part of the mainstream, whether
this be for religious, moral, political, professional, or other reasons.

The dialect allows easy recognition of those who are \'in\', vs. those
that are \'out\'. Recall the special language you shared with your
High-school friends that adults or other high-schoolers would look at
you quizzically about. Most TMLers, I wager, would recognize what "\'tis
but a scratch" refers to, but the majority of the US citizenry probably
does not.

I just watched \'Demolition Man\' last night. The future Police woman has
studied the 1990s slang, and still comes up with \'let\'s blow this guy\'
instead of \'let\'s blow this guy away\', to the amusement of the audience.
Dialectical faux pas like this demonstrate the powerful \'in\' vs. \'out\'
recognition effects that a counter-cultural dialect can precipitate.

Deadheads use specialized words: \'Dosing\' and \'Cid\' for LSD. They refer
to the Dead band members by first name, and the use the venue rather
than the city to refer to a particular performance. They use \'show\'
rather than \'concert\'. Example: "Went to the Autzen show. Jim was really
happenin\'. I was dosin\' heavily." translates as "I attended the Eugene
concert at Autzen Stadium. The guitar player gave a very satisfying
performance. I had taken LSD." If you had said it the second way, the
Deadheads would know in four words that you were not clued in to the
life of a Deadhead.

Well, that looks like my cue to jump in and explain what\'s going on.

TNE-Pocket is a discussion group which is developing 4 subsectors of Reavers\'
Deep as a pocket empire and general setting for New Era adventures.  In our
humble opinions, this location represents the best mix of a rich history
(which we have taken considerable care to preserve and expand upon) combined
with unique adventuring possibilities in the New Era.

However, it is not accurate to say that our work is GDW "Approved" - it\'s not
official background material.  However, Dave Nilsen (Traveller product
manager at GDW) is aware of what we are doing, and GDW has no plans to
explicitly invalidate or contradict anything we write about Reavers\' Deep in
the New Era.  J. Andrew Keith (who, along with his brother William H. Keith,
was responsible for creating Reavers\' Deep for Classic Traveller) is also
aware of what we\'re doing, and has no objections.

The overall tone of the background is considerably different from that of the
official "Reformation Coalition" campaign.  As always in Reavers\' Deep,
things are a little different from that of the (former) Third Imperium.  The
empires are smaller (typically only one or two worlds), the tech levels are
lower (TL-9 is "average" for starfaring cultures in the region), and the
political situation is very different.  Alien cultures abound: Humans
(Solomani, Vilani, and human minor races), Droyne, Aslan, and several other
races are found in the area.

Initially, player characters are Humans (or optionally Droyne, if the referee
has the Classic Traveller materials to support Droyne PCs) from the Gralyn
Union, a small (two star system, three inhabited worlds) pocket empire at one
end of one of the major mains in the region.  The initial theme is
exploration - there\'s been no offworld contact for the last 70 years; the
players are equipped with partial library data and full starmaps (all of it
70 to 100 years old), and get to explore the New Era firsthand.

Material generated for TNE-Pocket is publishable, should we find a Traveller
magazine willing to print it.  Some of this material should start appearing
in The Traveller Chronicle (hopefully beginning with #4; several articles
have been submitted) and possibly other magazines in the future.

Currently, most of the available resources are in the form of background
material, outlines, and a set of adventure ideas that need development work.
Complete UWPs (pre-Rebellion, Hard Times, and New Era) are available for the
area, as is a set of library data entries, and a number of short world
descriptions.  History write-ups for the major worlds are also available, as
is a players\' introduction.  This last was written for one of the two
"playtest" campaigns.  These campaigns are currently being run by TNE-Pocket
contributors are in progress using the available background.  I expect these
campaigns to generate adventure material which will be used to fill out the
resources available.

Almost all of the material that has been generated to date is available for
anonymous FTP from the archive site at typhoon.berkeley.edu in the
\\pub\\Traveller\\TNE-pocket directory (note the capitalization, it\'s important)
and it\'s subdirectories.  I just checked, and the archive is up to date as of
about a month ago.  You may have to sort through the archived messages (the
files List.*) to find the most recent stuff.

The current plan is to pull together sufficient background and adventure
material, once it is all generated, and make a sourcebook for New Era
adventures in Reavers\' Deep that we can then make available on the archive
site.  There is, however, a considerable amount of work that needs to be done
before that will happen.

I agree completely.  Even if you\'re not the sort who can ad lib accents, the
very fact that the PCs have to find a translator at times reminds them that
they\'re "not in Kansas anymore".  Another important point about language was
illustrated by Chewbacca and Artoo-Deetoo in the *Star Wars* films - being
able to *understand* a language doesn\'t mean you have to be able to (or are
even capable of) *speaking* it.  Contrary to `official\' policy, I\'ve never
had Humans able to *speak* Vargr or Aslan languages, nor could these races
speak Galanglic.  Each might understand the other but any being who only
understood one tongue would only get half of an overheard discussion.  This
means that *both* sophonts must posses second languages in order for
communication to take place.

(The *Star Wars* films used the clever device of having other characters 
`translate\' for us knuckleheads in the audience.  Another clever device was
used in *The Hunt for Red October* in which the Russians started out speaking
Russian with subtitles but `dramatically\' switched to English once we got the
point.)

The point about feudalism is that a system with a strong monarch is no longer
feudal.  Under feudalism, *all* of the chief\'s power comes from the support
of her vassals.  Since it\'s often difficult to keep these vassals in 
agreement, feudal systems are prone to fragmentation.  Remember *Excalibur*?
*Any* night could `dub\' another night - not just the `king\'.

Yes, but the federal government has specific powers granted to it by the
Constitution - particularly taxation and a military; they\'re *not* `granted\'
by the individual States.  A better example would be the European Union, which
has no powers except those granted by the member nations.  And excuse me if I
offend some European sensibilities, but, from this side of the Pond, it
looks pretty fragmented.

> Lucan *could* have cowed the Moot, if he had the backing

Etc.

Again, under a feudal system the Emperor would have had no power to coerce
*anybody* except that granted and *provided* by the Moot (his vassals).  That
Lucan was able to cow the Moot meant that he had access to power *outside*
that of the Moot.  (Or else, he had access to a majority - or plurality -
of the Moot\'s power and was able to `quell\' the rebellious nobles in the
Moot.)  What happened though was that the Imperial Navy existed as a force
external to the Imperial nobility and this was the power used by Lucan to
move against the Moot.

> Examples would include many of the great dictators: Caesar, Napolean, and
> Hitler.

Again, none of these men rose to power in a feudal system.  Both Caesar and
Napoleon used the military as a base of power outside the `nobility\' and Hitler
came to power through a political party structure that again was *outside*
the `feudal\' apparatus, which, in modern nations, is represented by the
economic power base - corporations and the like.

A centrally-strong feudal structure has never existed.  A good case study
would be Alexander the Great.  Through the force of his personality he was
able to get the various groups he conquered to give up their own interests
in favor of `further\' conquests.  As soon as Alexander died and the `Great
Mission\' came to an end, his various lieutenants began squabbling among
themselves and the empire fragmented.  Sort of like when Uther Pendragon
died.  You might hold them together in the face of a common enemy but as soon
as the vassals get a breather they\'ll be at each other\'s throats.

Well, actually, there\'s Africa, South Asia, Latin America, Central Asia.
Eastern Europe, *North* America.  I can\'t seem to bring to mind *anyplace*
where the locals are glad they were overrun by the `benevolent civilizers\'.

Un uh.  Look at the former Soviet states.  They have no tradition whatsoever
of democractic principles.  The current Russian legislture, the Duma, is
named for the *first* legislative advisory body established by the tsars,
who were autocrats, which didn\'t have the clout of the British Parliament
in Oliver Cromwell\'s day.  Democratic principles in Western European society
go back hundreds of years and yet just two generations ago we were still
*lynching* folks to keep them from voting here in the US!  The Imperium,
whose roots were in yet another `empire\', has been around for 1100 years.
So I ask, where does the idea that `Jane Everybody\' has just as much say as
`Peter Plutocrat\' come from?

May be, but the Star Vikings, at least as they\'ve been described, don\'t
seem to be interested in markets at all.  I again refer y\'all to Beam\'s
novel.  Lucas Trask, the Space Viking of the title, was one of the few to
realize that he\'d be better off `trading\' with the worlds of the `wilds\' than
he\'d be `chicken stealing\'.  It\'s kind of like that story about teaching the
starving man how to fish; and yet the Star Vikings who are `recovering\' lost
technology are still looking for that free hand out.

My point exactly.  It\'s just that there is no current benefit to sell to RC
`voters\' except for altruism - again, not something that jumps to my mind
when I think of `gun-toting\' vikings.

The key point to remember is that with a strong, central government the RC is
either going to be `altruisitc developers\' or `chicken stealers\' - there\'s
no room for both.

I guess my point is that regardless of how diverse various dialects might or
might not be these folks can understand the `common\' or `majority\' language
good enough to get by - or else they\'d learn to understand it like Hispanics
in North America and the Japanese have learned American English.  The real
question I guess is how much English the Japanese would speak after 70
years if us Americans `went away\'?

I agree. However, don\'t mistake the tone of my earlier posting - I was 
intending to comment, rather than condemn. Certainly I have been part of
various groups over my life that have had \'in words\' - college rugby, in the
huuuugest way, you villager (sic).

 Okay, like the Revolutionary American Federalists.  Since the
 government is described as `representative\' I assume neither the
 Centrists nor Federalists believe in aristocracy?  Democracy, or some
 form of voting at least, is the way to govern.  One wonders where
 these `progressive\' attitudes come from (hasn\'t it been suggested that
 the Regency is more `democratic\' as well?) in the ruins of a millenia
 of aristocracy?  Democratic traditions just don\'t spring up over
 night, or even in seventy years, after that sort of history - look at
 the former Soviet Union.  (How long has it been since the Magna
 Charta?)  And the post-Imperial states haven\'t had a big democracy
 offering financial incentives to make the move to democracy either.
 Only in the mind(?) of GDW . . . .

And in the TNE rulebook.  The Reformation Coalition is pro-democracy
because it holds the Imperial system of government responsible for the
destruction of interstellar civilisation.  They don\'t see the rebellion
as some aberrant blip in the Third Imperium\'s history, some kind of
unfortunate accident that screwed it up.  The RCers see it as the
logical (perhaps inevitable) culmination of the whole Imperial system.
Hence they don\'t want to repeat the same mistakes.  Hence their attempt
to construct a new and fundamentally different form of interstellar
government.  And if you think about the history of the Traveller
universe they may have a point.  There have been three human
interstellar civilisations ruled using the Imperial system.  They have
all collapsed eventually.

As for the member worlds of the former Third Imperium having no
democratic traditions - well, some of them were democracies (look at
the UPP of some of the old era sectors).  Local planetary governments
were free to use whatever system they liked so long as they towed the
line as far as Imperial policy was concerned and payed their taxes to
the Emperor.  The Imperium governed at the subsector level and above,
not at the planetary level.  Whenever a movement arose within the
Imperium to create a multi-star system govermental unit independent of
the Imperium it was discouraged by the Imperial Navy.  Remember the
Solomani Rim War?  All the Solomani wanted was independence from the
Imperium (using a democratic form of government).

I find it amusing that so many people have a rose-tinted view of the
Third Imperium.  They seem to regard it as some kind of utopia.  But it
was ruled by a hereditary aristocracy for Grudd\'s sake!  The whole
Imperial system was set up to benefit them.  And in the end, it was
their thirst for power that brought the Imperium down and killed
billions of sentient life forms.

Allen Shock:
 In all, the RC is a fairly organized governmental entity (at least for
 a relatively new government),

David Johnson:
 Okay, which means the Star Vikings are either all `bad\' or all `good\'
 depending on how you see the RCES defining it\'s role.  There won\'t be
 much variation in the ranks.

I think that this is a specious argument.  You\'re trying to force
things into one absolute or another.  There\'s is no reason for this to
be the case.  As a citizen of a newly emergent multi-nation government
(the European Union) the idea that somehow all the member governments
and their populations will be forced to think the same way strikes me
as ridiculous.  It just isn\'t happening.  That said, there are
nationalist\'s within every nation who would have you believe that this
is happening.

David Johnson:
 Aren\'t *markets* the fundamental `necessity of interstellar
 commerce\'?  Doesn\'t this sort of preclude `chicken stealing\' of any
 sort?  (Whether I call it `identification\', `location\', `preservation\'
 or whatever?)  Wasn\'t the collapse of *markets* (and access to them),
 in GDW\'s own words, what led to the collapse of the Imperium during
 the Rebellion rather than a lack of resources?  (Do they ever read
 what they put out after it hits the stores?)


Well, markets (and just about anything else) have a habit of collapsing
when you lob high-yield thermonuclear missiles at them.  As for the
development of interstellar commerce being incompatible with \'chicken
stealing\' - have you looked at the 19th century colonisation of
Africa?  Plenty of \'chicken stealing\' took place with the European
colonists ripping off the native Africans every which way they could
while they built (or rather extended and dominated) the local economy.
And exports from Africa were used to fuel the economic development in
Europe and in America.  Admittedly this is not a nice model for the
activities of the RC which is intent on practicising \'enlightened
selfishness\'.

Allen Shock:
 Hot Recovery, where those who have the tech want to keep it. All
 missions against TED\'s (Technologically Elevated Dictatorships) fall
 into this category.

David Johnson:
 Okay, so `good\' Vikings only hit TEDs while `bad\' Vikings will take it
 from you regardless.  Who makes this TED determination anyway?  The
 RCES?  That\'s sort of like the 1950s CIA looking for commies isn\'t
 it?


Sure, any classificatory system can be self-serving.  Remember the
Major/Minor race distinctions that the Vilani came up with?  It was a
handy way of keeping those uppity newcomers to the interstellar scene
in their place (below all those Vilani aristocrats).  Or look at the
foreign policy of any contemporary power such as the U.S.  Notice how
enemies of the U.S. are mysteriously transformed into enemies of the
free-world, democracy, goodness, god etc. I don\'t see how this is a
problem.  The RC see themselves as the good guys.  Other people may see
them as the bad guys.  Are they really good guys or bad guys?  It\'s up
to you but I think that there is much evidence to support either view.
Mabye they\'re neither.


Allen Shock:
    INTEGRATION: Actual integration of inhabited worlds into the RC.
    Quoting from the book, "Diplomacy is the preferred means of
 integrating a world into the Coalition". When the people like the
 government, and it treats them well, the RC tags the planet TDO (Trade
 and Diplomacy Only), no SAG\'s allowed.

David Johnson:
 So this is the United Federation of Planets!  :-)  (Join Starfleet!
 Tour the galaxy!  Meet interesting aliens!  And sleep with them!  :-)

Or mabye it\'s just the pragmatic recognition of the fact that a ruler
with a contented population who will support him in a war is a tougher
enemy than a ruler who is hated and who will not gain as much support.
Conquering a people and then ruling them is a difficult business and it
can tie down your resources (starships, military units) for years.
Look at Northern Island (an example from my own country\'s history).
This area was conquered 400 years ago and it still rebels against
British rule.  It is easier to rule when you\'ve the cooperation of the
ruled.  I don\'t think that the Coalition has the manpower and equipment
to force itself on the surrounding worlds.

Allen Shock:
     A second type of Integration method is Pacification. Only two
     worlds have been integrated this way, but there will undoubtably
 be more.

David Johnson:
 And this is the US in Somalia (only RC citizens give a damn about
 folks who aren\'t just like them and aren\'t squeemish in the face of
 casualties)?  Or is this the Soviets in Afghanistan, which the RCES
 uses as a training guide?  With a relatively stable, centralized
 government in the RC this `good vik\' - `bad vik\' issue will have to be
 resolved.


I don\'t think so.  Remember IranGate?  Seems that government agencies
and department\'s within agencies can have their own agendas, sometimes
incompatible with the policy of the government.  Out in the wilds you
are on your own.  Tough decisions must be made quickly.  RC personnel
have to interpret the guidelines.  Is this guy a real TED who we should
overthrow or is he not \'bad\' enough?  Don\'t know.  Better check with
headquarters.  Uh...they\'re only 8 weeks away by starship.

Allen Shock:
      REGENERATION is the final step; helping the worlds to rebuild
      their technological base and reestablishing interstellar
 commerce. This is, as the book points out, the major goal of the RC.
 Two operations are used here; Commerce with Free Traders and RC
 merchants,

David Johnson:
 Is this sort of like letting Exxon or Alcoa come into your country to
 help you develop?  (Or William Penn buying Manhattan for a handfull of
 beads?) Doesn\'t sound too benevolent to me.

But it creates lots of local jobs.  I assume that you think that the
economic development offered by the Third Imperium to its\' member
worlds was unselfish and totally beneficial?  Here\'s a nice man from
Naasirka who wants to build a huge industrial complex on your pastoral
planet...if you refuse, the local Imperial governor (who just happens
to be a member of Naasirka\'s board of directors) will be most
upset...no more Regional Aid for you.

David Johnson:
 Now this sounds benevolent but this has to come from altrusim - the RC
 won\'t recognize any benefit (other than spiritual) from this sort of
 behavior for decades.  My question is: do the TNE rules spend as much
 time explaining irrigation network as they do explaning armor piercing
 rounds?


Perhaps GDW didn\'t envisage people wanting to spend a lot of time
planning irrigation systems.  Still if enough people write in mabye
they\'ll release a rules supplement for it...


Allen Shock:
 >  That tone is one of empire building and the > forging of an
 interstellar government out of a group of loosely > cooperating worlds
 who face unknown dangers at their borders.

David Johnson:
 Maybe, but empire buliding is seldom very altruistic and often very
 bloody.  It seems to me there\'s a fundamental conflict in the goals of
 the RC.  Is GDW trying to make the RC everything to everyone?  Should
 they?  And more importantly, can they?  Is there the potential for a
 split between empire- builders and altruisitc-developers?  It seems
 the internal structure of the RC is more important to the Centrists,
 Federalists, and other blocs than are these fundamental issues of how
 the RC will interact with the rest of the world.

You are still intent on forcing the RC to be either one thing or the
other.  I don\'t see why it can\'t be both. Are you saying that this kind
of conflict in goals doesn\'t exist in the activities of real world
governments and their foreign policies?  I don\'t see this as a problem,
I see it as realism.  And I think that this conflict makes the setting
a lot more interesting.  Selfish RCers versus the do-gooders.  Yeah!

Allen Shock:
 > Whether that will be in the form of the RC and the Regency >
 combining or what, I dunno.

David Johnson:
 You can bet that by the time the RC meets the Regency each will have
 its own interests which will most likely be in conflict.  Those who
 have `rebuilt from scratch\' won\'t have any interest in turning over
 what they\'ve wrought to those who stood by `holding the torch\'.  Now
 there\'s an interesting conflict!  (And d**n, now I\'ve gone and
 broadcast it to everyone!)

I\'ve been thinking about this too.  Since the RC hates the Imperial
system and the Regency is the sole remaining part of the Imperium, I
don\'t think that they will get on too well.  I hope that GDW do publish
some information about what the Regency\'s plans are.  I would have
thought that they should be sending expeditions out into Deneb and
Corridor at the same time as the RC is beginning to expand.  Unless
some as yet unknown third party appears as a common enemy we can expect
conflagration when they contact each other.

NOT TRUE!  Read your own rules!  See FF&S p89 quotation below!

>       LKW

Well folx,

I hadn\'t had a good enough idea to try my hand at them yet, so
here\'s my first attempt at using FF&S for designing weapons.

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT:

A meson gun...

With a folding stock.

Check it out folx, there\'s no minimum size listed!  The limiting
factor on portability is the mass of the homopolar genarator.  To
keep mass down, I did away with the power source by throwing in an
explosive power generator (essentually a cartrige powered HPG).  I
took the rules for ruggedization and backpack power units from the
hand lasers section.

Loren says they didn\'t imply that meson guns could be small, but...
The rules section states:  (FF&S p 89)  "All heavy (non-small arms)
lasers, particle accelerators and meson guns require beam
pointers..."  To my mind that there are indeed NON small arms,
lasers, particle accelerators meson guns.  Ah well, go figure.

In any case, I proceed:  Since this is obviously not a *heavy*
weapon, no beam pointer is required.  However, as we need to know
the exact range to the target (so we know where the mesons need to
decay) a rather precise range finder is needed.  This turned out to
be the largest expence of building the gun (91% of total cost).  It
requires an electronic site and a laser site to determine the range
accurately for the meson stream.  The laser to illuminate the
target and the electronic site to get the range using the laser
spot for a reference.

Once range is accurately determined, the meson stream is targetted
10cm behind the range as set by the laser site in order to
penetrate armor accurately.  (This range spread can easily be
adjusted by the firer)

Disappointments:
Unfortunately, these turned out to be far heavier than I hoped them
to be.  However they could still be carried by a man in battle
dress, and the higher tech versions could just barely be carried
without an exoskeleton.  I also wanted to make the firing cycle
time faster, but that would have taken weight even higher, so we
are stuck with 1 shot per five second combat round.  However, as
this is a squad support weapon I found it to be acceptable.

Each of the weapons listed below has a DV of 20 (considered a DV of
1 when fired against ships).  Further, we are hitting the target
with 40,000 joules of radiation.  Now that is about 100 times the
dose of LD50.  This is far greater than Even Traveller medicine can
deal with.  The victim hit with the beam will die between 24 hrs
after exposure from neurologic and cardiovascular breakdown,
(Cerebrovascular Syndrome).

Range, is fine, the listed maximum range is the distance at which
the gun still has a DV of 20.  Note that according to FF&S this is
still \'short range\' for a meson gun.  I\'m not sure how this would
fit into the FF&S computations of what constitutes effective range.

Nevertheless this is basically a proof of concept.  I have a FAR
more dangerous idea than a Meson handgun.  A meson gun for dealing
with boarding parties and hijackers.  A small turret with a
homopolar generator located up on the bridge.  Hook it into the
security cameras for targetting information.  Now you don\'t NEED to
send Captain \'Vouf off with his gauss pistols to deal with the
robot running amok.  Just blast the little beastie from the bridge.
Fire right through the bulkheads, walls etc.  You might want to set
up additional guns to allow you to fire in such a way so you don\'t
have to fire through radiation sensitive equipment.  Two or three
guns ought to allow you to hit any spot on the ship.

My initial estimate on this set up is that you could put one
together at TL 11 with a DV of 5 for 3500 cr or so, less at higher
TL.  Hooked into ship\'s power supply would allow you 1 shot per
combat round at 1MW draw.  Increased power input allows more shots
per round.  However, you might need an indirect fire site which
would cost 200,000 more.

Of further note:  All the hand units listed below are Bulk-0 for
purposes of fast draws.

(Here are some more detailed plans should any of you be interested
in the actual workings of it all):

Meson Body Pistol TL 11:

=====================
Total Mass:  864 gm
Total Cost:  2328 Cr
Loaded Nass:  912 gm
Max Range:  80 Km
Bulk:  0

DV of 1 (personnel damage that is) up to a range of 80 km.  Not a
whole lot, but remember that these things go right through ANY
armor.  Also, it may ONLY be a body pistol, but remember what one
of those did to the entire 3rd Imperium in the hands of Dulinor!

Radiation Damage:  Well, even for a 100 Kg human, this dose is a
bit above LD50/60.  We are in the range of Acute Radiation Syndrome
with gastrointestinal complications within 2 weeks, bleeding and
death in most exposed persons.

To be fair, tho, I have gone off the scale cost wise.  But even if
we multiply the cost of a tunnel and explosive power generator by
a factor of a thousand, the tunnel would cost 20 cr, and the EPG
would be 330 Cr.  This would of course be less at higher Tech
Levels.
==================================================================
Meson gun SMG  TL 11:

Tunnel:  500 joules draw
length:  10 cm           (Range 80Km at TL 11)

ROF:  10 shots per second
Total Mass:  922 gm
Total Cost:  2329 Cr
Loaded Nass:  1162 gm

I figure that a rate of fire of 10 per second is pretty dang close
to a continuous beam for aiming purposes.  And of course no recoil
either.

DV of 1 (personelle damage that is) up to a range of 80 km.

 Different crewing formula? I don\'t know. As planned right now,
 Battle Rider will contain rules for large fleet actions, (that
 is, fleets with a large number of ships) not rules for designing
 large ships. There might be a chapter of additions to FF&S/BL
 ship design, but I do not know what that will contain (I\'m not
 working on the project)

 Perhaps, in the aforementioned additional rules section.

 Doubtful.

 I\'m fairly sure it isn\'t, or it would be specifically discussed. Sorry
 to screw up your campaign, but I\'m sure we can help you work
 around it somehow.

 Strictly speaking no, but we did not intend for them to be made
 into small arms. The chapter on laser weapons deals in a fair
 amount of detail with making laser small arms. The chapters on
 PAWs and Meson guns do not, which indicates our intentions.

                      Criss-crossing Traveller
                   (and just about anything else)
                   ----
 
Dear Matt:
 
You posted the following on TML:
 
 >I\'m beginning to cross reference all of my Traveller matrial.
 
What did you mean by this statement?  ARE YOU INDEXING YOUR COLLECTION?
 
 >Does anyone have suggestions about software tools to make this
 >task easier?
 
The programs MaxThink and Transtext, used in conjunction, can
cross-reference just about anything. Not only that, MaxThink can
hold all of your custom campaign material as well, in an
organizational structure that is easy to understand and easy to
navigate.  MaxThink is a hierarchical outliner/editor with
EXTENSIVE interactive sorting, moving, and hypertext linking
capabilities.  MaxThink is the best hypertext AND text editing
product I\'ve ever found, and I\'ve been using it (through each of
its upgrades) fanatically on a daily basis since 1987. I rely on
it much more heavily than upon word processors (it subsumes the
most crucial functions of word processors, and adds many power
commands).
 
MaxThink allows you to manipulate text both directly AND by
paragraph, rather than merely by the cludgy block/move method
available in most word processors.  This makes it a VERY POWERFUL
text editing tool, much better suited for the tasks of writing
books, screenplays, speeches, articles, letters, designing game
products, organizing campaign materials, organizing literary
research, recording and developing ideas, task lists, projects,
plans of action, diaries, schedules, etc.  It lets you process
text as pieces of knowledge rather than as a mere conglomeration
of letters and words.
 
    I\'m a hypertext freak (I even ran a hypertext computer group)
    and I have looked over most of the hypertext products out
    there.  The problem with other hypertext systems is that they
    are displaying-oriented rather than editing-oriented.  Not
    these two programs.  They rely exclusively on ASCII text, and
    are designed specifically for the EDITING and MANIPULATING of
    text rather than the fancy formatting of it, hence making
    text and reference development a breeze.  Give a MaxThinker
    and a WordPerfect user a list of a several thousand pieces of
    information to organize, and the MaxThink user will have the
    list reorganized six ways \'til Sunday before the person using
    WordPerfect has gotten halfway down the list!  I estimate
    MaxThink and Transtext cut my literary chores (writing and
    referring to computer files) at least in HALF.  For complex
    research and writing projects, and anything to do with
    brainstorming/idea generation, the time savings is much
    greater.
 
 
    MaxThink works on paragraphs.
 
        Each paragraph can have as much or as little text in it
        as you want (even zero).  You can use a paragraph to
        contain one or more bonifide paragraphs, or to hold a
        single letter, word, phrase, sentence, idea, task, line
        of data, an item from a list, a string of hyphens, or
        just about anything else.  You can move using the "topic
        pointer" which hops from paragraph to paragraph, or you
        can enter EDIT mode and move the edit cursor through the
        text as in any word processor.
 
        You can SPLIT paragraphs at will, LOCK onto and drag a
        paragraph or a marked range of them to wherever you want
        in the document, GATHER paragraphs from here or there to
        a buffer from where you can juggle, move, or copy them.
        You can interactively BINSORT paragraphs into categories,
        sending each paragraph one-at-a-time to the bin of your
        choice, where each "bin" is also a paragraph of your
        choosing and becomes the parent of each paragraph you
        decide to assign to it.  You can RANDOMIZE the order of
        paragraphs, or SORT them alphabetically from any
        specified column across the screen.  Thus, just about any
        kind of textual information can be manipulated to great
        effect, whether it be lists, lines of data, source code,
        file names, or prose, or any combination of these.
 
        You can arrange paragraphs vertically or in
        subcategorical levels (like the tree-structure of an
        outline). Subcategories are basically nothing more than
        further indented paragraphs like the one below.  You can
        drag entire sections of your knowledge tree at will to
        anywhere else in the tree, and you can collapse or
        uncollapse any part of your outline (tree) into and out
        of linear form (a single list as opposed to a tree of
        sub-lists), and display as many or as few levels at a
        time as you like.
 
            THIS "paragraph" is a "subtopic" of the one above
            (its "parent" topic), because this one is further
            indented. You may or may not view this level from the
            parent\'s level as you so choose (with a simple
            display toggle).  If you were to move or copy its
            parent (or the parent\'s parent), then this paragraph
            (and all of its offspring) would go along with it...
 
                Child.                   \\
                    Grandchild.            \\
                    Grandchild.              \\
                        Great grandchild.      \\  All these offspring would
                Child.                         /  follow too.
                Child.                       /
                    Grandchild             /
                        Etc.             /
 
        You can write, print, or view your outlines in a variety
        of formats, with or without indentation, and with margins
        and spacing between paragraphs set by you.
 
        Furthermore, you can DIVIDE paragraphs by line, sentence,
        word, or paragraph!  You can also JOIN them together,
        with the option to have the words wrapped, or you can
        leave the linefeeds in place.  You can INSERT, DELETE,
        COPY, MOVE, GET, and PUT paragraphs at the push of a
        button, to anywhere in the outline you want.  And you can
        GATHER them automatically based on their content -- for
        instance, if you want to copy or move all the paragraphs
        with the name "Marc Miller" anywhere in them.  For added
        power, most commands work in conjunction with the
        program\'s range MARKing feature.
 
        To traverse your knowledge-base, the paragraphs are
        optionally displayed with numbers for ease of reference.
        There is the text cursor and the topic pointer, the Jump
        command, a list of user-defined short-cut jumps (the "X"
        marks the spot command), search (and replace) keys, and
        hypertext link-outs (to move to other files).  And you
        can truncate the display of paragraphs to show only the
        first line of each one, thereby allowing you to skim
        rapidly through your documents.  As mentioned earlier,
        you may also adjust the display to show a single level of
        your paragraph tree, or multiple levels, so you don\'t
        have to scroll through intervening subtopics, or even
        look at them.
 
                  APPLYING MAXTHINK TO TRAVELLER
 
        Here is an example of how I\'ve used this program to
        organize my Traveller campaign:  I read in all of the
        sector listings from sunbane as subtopics to a list of
        those sectors\' names (which I copied using the macro
        command).  Each world entry in the sector data was
        treated as a seperate paragraph, and became the
        repository for any custom development I\'ve done on that
        particular world.  E.g., all of my notes on Regina are
        placed as subtopic paragraphs created beneath the Regina
        entry in the Spinward Marches data listings.  To get to
        that custom material, I simply go down the list of worlds
        in the Spinward Marches using the Down Arrow cursor key
        (or by pushing the JUMP command and entering the
        paragraph number), then use the right arrow key to move
        to the level (indented) beneath it -- note that the next
        level down isn\'t seen until you go there, though you can
        toggle this feature at will.  The material beneath a
        paragraph can be contained in another file, in which
        case the right arrow key facilitates the jump to that
        file; hence you can have vast networks of interconnected
        files.
 
        One branch of my Traveller tree is devoted to the design
        of new adventures.  Each scenario under development is
        a subcategory in the outline.  The ideal Traveller
        outline would have all adventures ever published, but
        unfortunately, they are not available in magnetic media,
        for hooking files into an outline is quite easy...
 
        Paragraphs can contain DOS commands or the names of
        programs or files.  Such files can be jumped to with a
        single key, or they can be read in from or written back
        to disk with the push of an alt-key-combo, individually
        or as a marked range.  Commands or programs contained in
        paragraphs can also be executed with a single keystroke.
        Thus, you can use any document as a menu for other
        documents, or as a menu of programs or commands, or just
        for text, or any combination thereof.  Task lists take on
        a new meaning when the listed tasks double as buttons to
        start the programs needed to complete each task!  Add to
        this MaxThink\'s macro capability, and your paragraphs can
        fly across the screen and rapidly transform right before
        your eyes.
 
        By the way, the author of MaxThink refers to the
        paragraph-containing nodes as "topics" rather than as
        "paragraphs" as I have done.  I find the word "paragraph"
        easier for beginners to relate to.
 
The thing I like best about MaxThink is the ease by which it is
learned.  I find that even sixth-graders take to it like fish to
water, since it is an intuitive extension of their training with
writing outlines in class.  So far, I\'ve also introduced two
veteran Dungeon Masters to the program, and now they both develop
their AD&D campaign material exclusively in MaxThink.  One of
them is running Greyhawk, and has outline branches dealing with
every political entity, monster type, and major character on the
world, while the other has all the planned events for his
Dragonlance campaign spelled out in great detail.  My own AD&D
hypernet includes a huge compilation of custom spells
(categorized by level and type) and items, and the timelines and
character "sheets" from my Greyhawk campaign.
 
My largest outline is several megs in size, includes a great many
linked outlines, and includes hypertext links to still other
files, commands, and programs.  All my outlines are connected to
a master outline from which I can access everything.
 
I run my Traveller campaign sessions with MaxThink running in 5
windows right next to me.  MaxThink contains two windows of its
own, giving me a total of 10 outlines to work with.  I use one to
display my custom designed adventure and or adventure notes,
another to show the list of topics under development (my
Traveller menu), another to record the timeline as the game is
played, and still others to:  To display the stats and
backgrounds on each of the player characters and NPC\'s, to look
up info on particular worlds, refer to library data entries, ship
stats, encounter charts, alien lists and briefs, and my player
questionaire (for finding out what kind of scenario they\'re in
the mood to play), technology lists, equipment lists, my
Traveller bibliography, and my Traveller subject index.
 
I\'m currently building a library of .gif files of sci-fi, urban,
and wilderness settings to link out to from the appropriate
locations in the adventures I plan to create around them -- I\'ll
simply turn the computer screen and let the players feast their
eyes.  In addition to the link-outs to .gif files, I\'ll also
imbed page references to particular illustrations in my Traveller
collection.  My Traveller hypernet has grown to include several
hundred files, all linked together via MaxThink, and accessible
from any of the 10 windows I use.
 
If I had to describe Maxthink in a single phrase, that phrase
would be "raw editing and accessing power".  Can you tell I\'m
addicted?
 
 
Transtext is a quick-and-dirty hypertext word processor, which
works quite well with MaxThink, and can execute the same jump
outs as MaxThink can.
 
My hypernet of outlines and files contains all my written
projects and hobbies, including all the material for my Traveller
campaign, with links to all the magnetic media (TML buns, Sunbane
files, and HIWG Docs) I\'ve collected relating to Traveller.  All
without messing up the source files themselves.
 
Now back to you, Matt...
 
 >I have started with the Amber Zones from the JoTAS and I\'ll be
 >going from there.
 
STOP!
 
I\'m already working on a comprehensive index, which contains
everything you\'ve mentioned above (try and guess what program I\'m
using to build it).  I\'ve found this necessary because of the
immensity of my Traveller collection (now containing 500+ items),
and the incredible difficulty I\'ve had in finding bits of
information within its 15,000+ pages.  Too bad it isn\'t all
available in MaxThink format.  My guidebook currently has:
 
    1)  The most comprehensive product and periodical listings of
        Traveller-related materials ever compiled.
 
    2)  A growing bibilography currently listing over 950
        articles written for Traveller.
 
    3)  A growing index currently spanning more than 50
        Traveller-containing publications, divided by major
        subject category, for quickly locating the page reference
        of all significant information on any piece of equipment,
        any career, starship, animal, alien, sector, subsector,
        world, company, NPC, news item, etc. covered in the
        included publications.
 
    4)  A chapter of tips for Traveller collectors.
 
Perhaps we can combine our efforts.  If I get it finished during
my lifetime (doesn\'t SEEM likely), I plan to publish it.  Anyone
who assists me will receive the latest prepublication version of
the guide.  Lets talk.
 
Cheers,
Rodge.

  Path of Tears (an excellent RC sourcebook, in my opinion) gives
  us a look at some of the psychology that drives the Reformation 
  Coalition, and a glimpse of the kind of interstellar state that 
  they (and presumably the Hivers) want.  The information that we 
  have on the Regency, though scantier, implies that the Regency 
  will be fundamentally based on the old Third Imperium model, with 
  some modifications.  I see a conflict of fundamental ideas 
  coming.

  The 3I (Third Imperium) model was one in which planets were 
  allowed to have whatever kind of government and social system 
  they desired, subject to only loose constraints (no slavery, no 
  nukes, honor extrality...).  Additionally, Imperial interference 
  in internal matters (revolutions, coups, etc.) was (at least 
  theoretically) nil.  The RC model appears to be strongly 
  anti-theocracy and anti-despotism, and aiding one side or another 
  in a local conflict appears not to be \\mallum in se\\.

  What will happen when these two states (the Regency and the RC) 
  come into contact, as they inevitably will?

  One problem that the RC is experiencing, and will probably 
  continue to experience for a long time to come, is the need for 
  high technology, without having the technological and industrial 
  base to meet those needs.  They will aid lower tech planets in 
  "seeding" a technological/industrial base, but it is simply not 
  possible to force-grow such a base beyond the current sustainable 
  technology level - a thorough understanding of one level of 
  technology and a strong industrial base built on that level are 
  required before it is possible to build into the next technology 
  level.  As planetary populations grow, and centers of learning 
  and industry develop, the sustainable technology level will rise.  
  The likely result of this is a RC with a high-tech center, with 
  the tech level gradually tapering off proportional to distance 
  from Aubaine.  This will lead to a situation much like we see on 
  Terra today, with over-industrialized nations experiencing 
  economic problems due to commodity manufacturing being done 
  "offshore," and in those "offshore" planets, a great deal of 
  exploitation of resources, including human resources, and a 
  generally lower (possibly much lower) standard of living.  
  Incorporation by the RC of active high-tech cultures will only 
  minimally alleviate this problem, providing small local regions 
  with higher standards of living.  However, these cultures, once 
  admitted to the RC, will almost certainly have their economies 
  and manufacturing bases distorted by a need to "feed" the central 
  areas of the RC.  Assuming freedom of travel from one world to 
  another, we\'re looking at the ghettoization of space, with all of 
  its attendant problems (again, look at present-day Terra for 
  examples of what can happen).

  The Regency will also have the same kind of high-tech center, 
  because the center did not lose the technology in the first 
  place.  However, the Regency will have access to the Jumpstart 
  caches, which will allow a more even development of the 
  technological and industrial base - or, the Regency can do 
  nothing, and allow the reintegrated areas to develop on their 
  own.  In either case, the Regency is likely to have less of a 
  ghettoization problem, as they have no need to scavenge high 
  technology, and their expansion is not driven by a need to import 
  from an external market.  High tech centers will develop, but not 
  in such a way that they will be driven to focus on serving the 
  needs of an already extant high-tech area.

  Does the RC know that the Regency and the other Spinward states 
  exist?  Do the Hivers?  Does the Regency know about the survival 
  of the Hive Federation?  About the RC?

  At this point in time, we must assume that the answer to all of 
  these questions is "no" and that both the Regency and the RC will 
  develop in their own way, until they meet.  That meeting is 
  likely to occur due to both states attempting to integrate or 
  build forward bases on the same planet.  With such a fundamental 
  difference in outlook, we can expect to see armed conflicts, as 
  the Regency tries to prevent undue interference in the internal 
  affairs of a client or member state, while the RC is trying to 
  mold the state into what they feel is an "appropriate" shape for 
  membership.  Add to this mixture the Guild, which will try to 
  keep both interstellar states out of the picture, and I think 
  we\'re going to see the (N+1)th Interstellar Wars/Pacification 
  Wars/Wars of Integration/Coalition Wars/Regency Wars/Guild Wars.

Linguistics and the Collapse:
James says:

> "proper" English. Retentively prim & proper, to be precise. Unless

(I assume by "retentively" you mean we retain the correct spellings) 

I think what we have to distinguish here are dialect, accent and idiom.

Dialects are different versions of the same language, which are 
different enough to have, for example, variant grammatical rules and 
vocabularies. I read somewhere that England has over 50 mutually 
incomprehensible dialects, whereas the US has about 3 (can\'t remember 
the exact numbers, but it is of those proportions). Which shows that 
geographical spread is not so much a factor as history and technology.

Accents are different ways of pronouncing the same words, and 
combinations of words. Liverpudlian is an accent, and in turn includes 
several sub-accents depending on where in Liverpool you may be (again, 
I suspect the degree of geographic variation is higher than in the US). 
The "prim & proper" way of speaking is referred to here as "received 
pronunciation", or maybe "BBC English". Note that the Royal Family 
don\'t use it; they seem to use a 1940s variant no-one else uses (Prince 
Philip is of course Greek, so I suppose he has an excuse). Received 
pronunciation is really South East England middle class English. The 
other classes in the South East use variants (for example, cockney, or 
the increasingly fashionable Thames Estuary variant). Other regions 
have their own variants, and the middle classes there speak versions of 
received pronunciation tinged with the local accent (in my case, North 
Yorkshire). By the way, my parents and grandparents can/could 
distinguish village origin on the basis of accent, that\'s 3 miles 
difference.

Idioms, or slang, are variant ways of saying specific things. 
Realistically, you couldn\'t go through your whole life talking this 
way, and speakers could probably drop pretty easily back into the 
general swing of things without really trying very hard. Usually you 
would associate such talk with a specialist sub-group (programmers, 
teenagers, Grateful Dead fans, etc). OF course, regions associated with 
accents would probably have a tendency to use idiom, eg cockney rhyming 
slang, or Texas cowboy references.

Now, applying this to Traveller:

Firstly, the only thing to have developed during the collapse would be 
idiom, given the timescales involved. And that would be mostly morbid 
humour, given the circumstances (eg virus-head). Some is likely to be 
the result of generational cultural changes (ie teenage slang). I doubt 
though that most planets are sustaining the degree of variation we see 
today, mainly because our late 20th Century culture is more buoyant (by 
analogy, how strong is the Bosnian pop scene?).

In the pre-collapse Imperium, I would guess that most planets have 
their own accent, and a strong degree of idiom based on planetary 
background (eg on a waterworld there would be a lot of water based 
references). In most cases, planet wide (even intra system) variation 
would tend to be low, but the nature of Traveller inter-system 
communications is such that the differences *between* planets should be 
fairly high.

Dialectical differences are likely to be as a result of hybrid Solomani 
and minor human (or vocally compatible non-human) populations, and 
would be relatively few and far between (or at least mutually 
incomprehensible dialects). Most such differences would have been wiped 
out for practical purposes by trade and communications requirements. 
The Imperial culture is pretty invasive, probably to an even greater 
extent than Anglo-Saxon (mainly American) culture is beginning to 
invade other cultures. 

However, you might get some mileage out of having NPCs speak Yoda 
fashion and claiming that the NPC was speaking GalAnglic using Vilani 
sentence construction, in the same way that the Germans always put the 
verb at the end of the clause. Also remember that in Solomani space 
some populations are commited to derivations of languages other than 
English.

Another trick to look at is to generate non-galanglic words, for 
example Vargr, and then try and figure out how they would look after 
500 or so years of absorption into English. The longer words would 
shorten, and any even slightly difficult pronunciations would be 
smoothed. Then rewrite the word with a phonetic spelling. A useful 
model to look at would be Burgess\' book "the Clockword Orange", where 
the teenage yobbo slang is derived from Russian. 

Alternatively, the upper classes might be tempted to using pretentious 
First Empire words and phrases based on Vilani (as we have in English 
phrases such as savoir-faire), so pick up a few Vilani phrases for the 
Imperial Court.

Finally, remember that mobility is the great leveller: characters who 
have joined the Imperial services, both civil and military, or who have 
served in interstellar trade, are likely to speak the equivalent of 
received pronunciation, albeit with a tinge of their homeworld. Media 
personnel are likely to have the ability to speak clear received 
GalAnglic as a prerequisite for their job, and the starports are pretty 
likely to be fairly homogenous.

Probably.  Hasn\'t it already been suggested that the Regency is somewhat more
`democratic\' (whatever that means) than the Imperium?  But I would expect this
impression to be `altered\' by a Regency sourcebook in a fashion similar to the
way the `star viking\' impressions of the RC were altered by *Path of Tears*.

I\'m not so sure.  Remember that high technology is basically a Western cultural
tradition - other areas of Earth have different traditions that have not led
to the development of high technology.  Now, admittedly, some of this is
due to the advantage in ability to access and exploit resources that early
industrialization has given the West but nevertheless the West enjoys certain
cultural traditions that facilitate high technology.  Look at the efforts
to develop legal structures in the former Soviet states that reduce the risks
to investment necessary for high-tech endeavors.

(I\'m not trying to suggest that Western culture is somehow `better\' than other
cultures, merely that is is better suited to the practice of technology - that
`technology\' is part of the Western cultural tradition.  Whether that is a
`good thing\' or not remains to be seen.)

Such will not be the case in the worlds that are `integrated\' into the RC.
All former Imperial worlds, to a certain extent, will enjoy a `technological\'
cultural tradition.  They will not face many of the obstacles to technological
development faced by non-Western cultures on Earth.

Not necessarily.  Had TNE occurred several hundred years after the Rebellion
maybe the technological traditions of the Imperium would have been lost but
in just seventy years, or even 150 if it takes the RC that long to expand a
great deal, those traditions will still exist.  Look at the Renaissance of
Western Culture after the Dark Ages - much of what had been done in the 
Classical Era was quickly reincorporated into the culture.

I don\'t see how this is relevant.  It would never be obsolete for
the material it covered -- and there\'s a heck of a lot of
material out there.  For instance, I still find the JTAS index by
Brian Sarver quite useful, and would not consider it obsolete.
 
Most Traveller refs are limping along with their own memories as
the main tool for finding particular references in the vast
amounts of material that have been written.  The only relevant
questions in my mind are whether or not there is a market for such
a reference aid, and whether or not it would be worth the effort?

Interesting.  Would you have to do the thing yourself?  Why not
hire the job done?  What would such an index be worth to you?
 
There are probably several TML\'ers (myself included) who could
probably be induced to take on such a project, and who would do
an excellent job of it as well.

Although I realize that you question was directed at James (and I don\'t know
how TML was formed, since I haven\'t been here that long), I can answer about
TNE-Pocket and GDW-Beta.

In the case of TNE-Pocket, the list has its origins in the complaining,
moaning, and wild speculation that went on here on the TML during the months
leading up to the publication of Survival Margin and then Traveller: The New
Era.  An interesting discussion had just finished, where the members of the
TML all pitched in a collective effort to detail a sector.  Then a new round
of (mostly pointless) discussion about the shape of the New Era arose.

At some point, the New Era and the subsector detailing project merged in my
brain, and I suggested that interested members of the TML join in detailing
an area of space in the New Era - a Traveller: New Era Pocket Empire. 
George W. Herbert graciously offered to administer a mail reflector and
archive site out at ocf.berkeley.edu, and the rest is history.

I believe this all happened during a short period when the TML was down for
one reason or another.  The discussion was carried on "TML - Not!", and
should be in the TML-Not archives on sunbane.  One of the major reasons for
taking that discussion off of the TML was that it quickly turned to subjects
that weren\'t relevant to the TML as a whole - the Traveller equivalent of
"how many angels can dance on the head of a pin" (how many starships does
the Gralyn Union have in 1200, for example).


There is one other active Traveller discussion group, GDW-Beta.  This group
was originally formed by invitation to playtest and check Fire, Fusion, and
Steel prior to its publication.  In this case, the size of the group was
limited both at GDW\'s request and fit the group\'s planned activities.  That
initial function done, the group has generally settled into a rules and
design sequence discussion.

Because GDW-Beta operates off of my work site, I\'m reluctant to expand the
membership greatly.  However, I have thought of a way that GDW-Beta can be
of more help the the TML community in general.  If you have a rules
question, send a copy of it to GDW-Beta@quark.qrc.com and all of us on the
list will see it.  There\'s a good chance that some one of us knows or can
get the answer, and we\'ll get it back to you.


> Would any of you TML\'ers be interested in having access to such
> an area?  Who wants a discussion area on the Regency?

Having been the instigator at least partly responsible for two discussion
gruops, I\'m hardly the person to tell you "No" (and the Internet being what
it is, I certainly can\'t stop you).

However, I do suggest that a debate on the nature and structure of the
Regency is well within the TML\'s scope and charter, and is probably of
interest to the majority of the members of TML.  If it gets to the point
where Regency-related traffic threatens to swamp the TML, you can always
take it off to a separate discussion group at that time.

So, in short, my response is "Yes, let\'s talk about the Regency" and "No, we
don\'t need a special-interest group to do that, the TML is fine for now".

Nor is this the first time that this has happened with Traveller
venues.  Jim Kelleher (a bay area ref & gamer) generated a character
back in the legendary era of CT, long long ago in the mists of time
(Am I dating you, Jim?) which rolled up, by the then-rules, as
the Countess of Regina.  This causes some small amount of
consternation when later CT/MT materials presented Norris as
the Duke of Regina.  Jim\'s character is still in play and people who
play in Jim\'s campaigns cope.  Background is often as pliable as the
rules are...

Uh, er...guys...it was the Dutch who traded 24 Tollars worth of junk 
jewellry to the Iraquois for the rights to the island of Mahattan,
in 1625.  William Penn was granted, by the English Crown, the new 
world colony of Pennsylvania, mostly to get those troublesome Quakers
to move out of England.  Pennsylvania was officially settled in 1682.

Incidentally, the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam had reasonably
good relations with the local Iraquois, much better than the English
colonists who took rather than bargained for land.  The Quakers and
other settlers in Pennsylvania, being takers of rather than bargainers
for land, had a fairly rough time with the natives...  Penn had this
silly idea that the natives could be converted into peaceful co-habitors
of the colony...  

In terms of analogies, I would opine that Exxon, Alco, and the mercantile
17th century Dutch are a much happier alternative to the English
Colonists, who were nothing better than opportunistic conquerers.
And while I\'m thinking about it, the Journals of Lewis and Clarke would
make excellent background material for an IISS or RCES or generic
exploration campaign.  (What?  _NOT_ read the journals of Lewis and
Clarke?!?  They\'re better than most modern sci fi...)

	I once played with the idea. Unfortunately layout out a 200t startship
is tantamout to layout out a three story house. It\'s a lot of work. Sketching
it is much, much, faster.
	Having been frustrated with this I started writing a program to convert

Don\'t worry, from this side it looks pretty fragmented too.  I think
that the European Union is going through the trauma of birth at the moment
and that once this has passed it will become a far more cohesive
entity.  To compare it with the U.S. of today is a little unfair - the U.S.
has had it\'s federal system for almost 300 years!  And it has gone through
its\' own share of trauma\'s such as the Civil War.  I also thought that the
original 13 colonies that founded the U.S. had to ratify the Constitution.
Their representatives all met to write it and then the state assemblies
approved it.  Only once this had happened did it become binding (please
feel free to correct me - my knowledge of American history is shakey).
The Civil War itself was an argument (conducted with cannons) about the
authority of the federal government over the individual member states.
In Europe, we\'ve just gone through a similar process with The Treaty
of Maastricht which defines the powers of the European government.
Arguments about the extent of the powers of the new government are
still continuing even though the treaty has been ratified.  But I
expect that 300 years from now, the European Union will be much more
united than it is now.

So I think it\'s fair to say that the RC government is in the same
position as the U.S. federal government just after the Revolution.
Things are still up in the air as to the final form of the Constitution
and the shape of the government.  And that is how it is described in
Path of Tears.

True, but then it was just as true of the Third Imperium.  How many worlds
that were \'invited\' to join the Third Imperium really wanted to?  The
discontent of the member worlds of the Imperium didn\'t seem to pose any
threat to its\' survival - why should it threaten the RC?

Your view of the RC suffers from the fact that you haven\'t read Path of Tears.
They don\'t just engage in \'chicken stealing\'.  As Allen has already stated
the RC don\'t steal high-tech gear off people who are using it correctly i.e.
for benevolent purposes (such as keeping their communities alive).  They
do steal it off people who are using it incorrectly i.e. oppressing their
communities.  Plus the RC also puts back - it doesn\'t just take.  It supplies
technical knowledge, trained personnel and tools to help people reconstruct.
This doesn\'t sound like \'chicken stealing\' to me.

Hmm...the U.S. donates millions of dollars in aid to Third World development
programs *and* it invades and occupies small Third World nation states like
Vietnam, Granada and Panama.  Is the U.S. government an \'altruistic
developer\', a \'chicken stealer\' or both?

  The Regency will also have the same kind of high-tech center, 
  because the center did not lose the technology in the first 
  place.  However, the Regency will have access to the Jumpstart 
  caches, which will allow a more even development of the 
  technological and industrial base - or, the Regency can do 
  nothing, and allow the reintegrated areas to develop on their 
  own.  In either case, the Regency is likely to have less of a 
  ghettoization problem, as they have no need to scavenge high 
  technology, and their expansion is not driven by a need to import 
  from an external market.  High tech centers will develop, but not 
  in such a way that they will be driven to focus on serving the 
  needs of an already extant high-tech area.

What amazes me is the fact that the Regency isn\'t already expanding
into Deneb and Corridor at a furious rate (or indeed, into Verge
via the Jump-5 route across the Great Rift).  Either the Regency
still fears Zhodani betrayal or a war with the Aslan colonies while
its\' efforts are concentrated on rebuilding its trailing worlds or
it still believes there to be a strong threat from the Virus.  But
since the Virus (except for a few pockets here and there) has
largely disappeared there is nothing to stop it.  And with the
Regency\'s industrial base largely intact it should be able to
expand very rapidly.  Frankly, in a contest between the Regency
and the RC I don\'t see how the RC could win.  They are just too
small.  Which means that GDW must be planning on keeping the
Regency within its\' existing boundaries for some time to come (to
give the RC time to catch up).  I don\'t personally find this credible.

Jeff Zaitlin:
  Does the RC know that the Regency and the other Spinward states 
  exist?  Do the Hivers?  Does the Regency know about the survival 
  of the Hive Federation?  About the RC?

What about the K\'kree?  They\'ve always been (pardon the pun) the
dark horses of the Traveller universe.  Could they make a bid
for increased living room (bigger, brighter pastures await you
in the ruins of the former Third Imperium).  But mabye they just
live too far away...

Jeff Zaitlin:
  At this point in time, we must assume that the answer to all of 
  these questions is "no" and that both the Regency and the RC will 
  develop in their own way, until they meet.  That meeting is 
  likely to occur due to both states attempting to integrate or 
  build forward bases on the same planet.  With such a fundamental 
  difference in outlook, we can expect to see armed conflicts, as 
  the Regency tries to prevent undue interference in the internal 
  affairs of a client or member state, while the RC is trying to 
  mold the state into what they feel is an "appropriate" shape for 
  membership.  Add to this mixture the Guild, which will try to 
  keep both interstellar states out of the picture, and I think 
  we\'re going to see the (N+1)th Interstellar Wars/Pacification 
  Wars/Wars of Integration/Coalition Wars/Regency Wars/Guild Wars.

This depends very much on any future political change within the
Regency.  It has already moved towards a more democratic system.
It\'s connection to the Third Imperium will taint it in the eyes
of most RCers but then, we can\'t all be perfect.  The RCer may
consider the Imperium to have been immoral in some of its\' 
practices but I don\'t think that they place it at the same level
as your average TED (basically what the Imps would have called a
barbarian with nukes).  The Imperium, whatever its\' faults, was
civilised.

I\'m not sure from reading Path of Tears to what extent the RC
tries to force a One True Way on the worlds it integrates.  The
Federalist faction seems to believe in promoting diversity of
cultures/political systems within the Coalition while the
Feudal Technocrats seem to want to squeeze everyone they re-contact
into their mould.  At the moment there is no clear indication which
faction will come to dominate the Coalition.  The RC is definitely
opposed to any government/society which routinely tortures, murders,
enslaves and otherwise oppresses its\' citizens on a daily basis or
which regards outsiders as \'the enemy\' or technology as \'evil\'. I
think that a lot of the people in the Regency would also agree
with that.  It still leaves a lot of room for different kinds of
government.  I think that the RCers think that the attitude of
the Third Imperium towards its\' member worlds was \'so long as
you pay your taxes, we don\'t care what you do to your people\' or
\'he may be a bastard, but he\'s our bastard\'.  This kind of laissez-
faire, amoral attitude is definitely out the window.

As far as the Guild is concerned, while it has high ambitions to 
dominate interstellar space I think that it lacks the organisational
structure to do so, and that faced with an opponent like the Regency
it will quickly be removed as a power.  I think that it poses more of
a threat to the RC because the RC doesn\'t have the kind of resources
at its\' disposal that the Regency has, and is spread much more thinly.
I expect the RC to dispose of the Guild in the next 10 years (unless
the Guild changes its\' structure and becomes much more like a 
government).

The next big plot development we can expect to see concerns the
Black Curtain.  Path of Tears mentions the "Vampire Highway" that
leads into the Core of the former Imperium (straight to the centre
of Lucan\'s territory).  Obviously the Virus has been busily at work
there for the last 70 years building...something.  No doubt that
something will be unleashed on an unsuspecting Universe in the near
future.  I would expect the RC and the Regency to put aside their
differences and fight this common enemy (anyone remember Fred
Saberhagen\'s Berserkers?).

Cynthia:
    I can..  look further back in time.  Most of Rome\'s possessions
were proud of their Romanized culture and of the protection of the
legions...  AFTER a few centuries of Romanization.  (Right after the
Romans conquered them, they weren\'t too thrilled about it...  remember
Boudicca\'s rebellion?  Vercingetorix?)  The Romanized Celts of Britain
and Gaul were very unhappy to lose the protection of the legions as
the Empire collapsed.  The cases you cite are all relatively modern,
and had only a century, at most, to be assimulated by the invading
culture.  And note that both Latin America and Africa have been glad
to keep the *religions* of their invaders (Roman Catholicism in Latin
America, Islam in much of Africa).  Come to think of it, most of the
areas of Africa and Central Asia that were overrun by the "benevolent
civilizers" spreading the word of Allah from Arabia are glad they were
overrun by the followers of Mohammed (peace be upon him) -- again,
after a few centuries of assimulation.

     BTW, an interesting reversal is what happened in China
repeatedly...  barbarians invaded and conquered, and were so taken by
the advanced culture and high standard of living of the Chinese, that
they, the conquerors, were assimulated by the Chinese.  (Barbarians
glad they overran the \'benevolent civilizers\'?)  Hmmm...  wonder if
this could happen when the RCES hit the Regency?

Democratic principles in Western European society
go back hundreds of years and yet just two generations ago we were still
*lynching* folks to keep them from voting here in the US!  The Imperium,
whose roots were in yet another `empire\', has been around for 1100 years.
So I ask, where does the idea that `Jane Everybody\' has just as much say as
`Peter Plutocrat\' come from?
- ----
Cynthia:
    Roman Republic, c.500 B.C.  Athens, c.700 B.C. (my dates on
classical Greek civilization are fuzzy)  Anglo-Saxon and Scandanavian
cultures ---- thanes/jarls were *elected* back before the idea of
hereditary warlords settled in.  Ancient Celts -- "nobility" (anyone
with property and weapons) *elected* their kings.  Democratic, or at
least republican principles in western European society go back
THOUSANDS of years; hereditary warlords/kings/emperors/despots is an
idea that seems to appear when the decision-makers in republics get
more interested in their own aggrandizement than in the
public/clan/tribal good, and when the economy is wealthy enough to
support it.  Note that most primitive tribes (a la Bushmen, pygmies,
etc) have an almost purely communist economy/society -- "from each
according to his abilities, to each according to his needs".

    The idea that "Jane Everybody\' has just as much say as \'Peter
Plutocrat\' comes from incredibly ancient times when everyone in the
tribe/clan contributed to its well-being, and thus had a say... there
were NO \'Peter Plutocrats\'.  Later, everyone who "contributed" (owned
property or weapons) was considered worthy of having a say (Celts,
Athenian Greeks, Saxons, Norse, etc).

    Despotisms are an outgrowth of advances in civilization, where a
specialized ruling/administrative class could arise.  Most despotisms
justify their authority by the excuse that "they have the
responsibility of running the nation, so they must have the authority
to run the nation," oft cloaked in verbiage about the Divine right of
kings or some such.

    This excuse rests on the assumption that only the
ruler/nobility have the capability to make decisions for the good of
the nation...  the average "citizen" does not and must be taken care
of for his own/the nation\'s own good.  Democracy or lack thereof rests
solely on whether or not this assumption is held by the bulk of the
populace.  If it is, a "presumed qualified" (Peter Plutocrat?)
nobility will rule; if it is not, there will be revolution and unrest
until the populace wrests the power of government from whomever was so
foolish to presume that they had more right to make decisions about
"Jane Everybody\'s" life than "Jane Everybody" did.

And in the TNE rulebook.  The Reformation Coalition is pro-democracy
because it holds the Imperial system of government responsible for the
destruction of interstellar civilisation.  They don\'t see the rebellion
as some aberrant blip in the Third Imperium\'s history, some kind of
unfortunate accident that screwed it up.  The RCers see it as the
logical (perhaps inevitable) culmination of the whole Imperial system.
Hence they don\'t want to repeat the same mistakes.  Hence their attempt

Cynthia:
    Their mistake assuming *ANY* form of government is immune to that
form of collapse.  It was the late Roman *Republic* that was beset by
the civil wars between Pompeii and Julius Caesar, and among the first
Triumvirate, and between Augustus, Brutus and Cassius.  Chang
Kai-Shek\'s corrupt "democracy" collapsed in the face of Mao\'s
revolution.  A democracy can collapse into chaos just as easily as an
Empire, if allowed to become corrupt.

    As for the development of interstellar commerce being incompatible
with \'chicken stealing\' - have you looked at the 19th century
colonisation of Africa?  Plenty of \'chicken stealing\' took place with
the European colonists ripping off the native Africans every which way
they could while they built (or rather extended and dominated) the
local economy.  And exports from Africa were used to fuel the economic
development in Europe and in America.  Admittedly this is not a nice
model for the activities of the RC which is intent on practicising
\'enlightened selfishness\'.
 ----
Cynthia:
    Another good model for the RC is the Spanish Empire when it
colonized and looted the New World.  The Spanish economy went into a
collapse from which it STILL has not fully recovered!  Why?  Cheap
goods from overseas looting made it impossible for local tradesmen and
craftsmen to compete, hence they went out of business, hence the
Spanish economy collapsed.  The same thing will happen to the RC if
they continue looting high-tech -- local industry will not be able to
compete / will have no impetus to improve, so the RC will remain TL
11-12, OR EVEN COLLAPSE back to lower TLs!  And when the TL14-15 loot
runs out (which it will eventually -- all taken or now owned by
enemies too tough to defeat), the RC will collapse.  You can\'t build
a healthy economy based on scavenging.

Dr.Halo to edit them, VPIC to transfer them back to GIF format.
Alternatively, use any number of shareware image-processing programs
to dump GIFs to BMP, PCX or TARGA format, and edit with your favorite
BMP editor, Windows PC-Paint or Image processing software, then
convert back to GIF format.  VPIC-Dr.Halo-VPIC is the cheap route --
VPIC is shareware that came with my graphics card, and Dr.Halo is
Commerical-ware that was bundled with my cheapo Genius mouse.  (Long
since dead, but I kept DrHalo.)  If you had Windoze inflicted on you

That drawing program is xgedit, a proprietary X11-based raster editor
that I developed for in-house graphics design, which working for
Hewlett-Packard.  It\'s not an HP product, and I retain the source
code rights, but since it was developed on HP time, I can\'t release
source without legal authorization from HP.  I *can* however, distribute
executables, assuming that I\'ve got a UNIX platform available to compile
on.  Currently, I can make binaries avaible for HP and Sun workstations.
Sorry, but it\'s not portable to PC/DOS/Windows environments.  The editor
can read and write XBM, XWD, TIFF (1 & 4 channel), and raw Eroff files.
It can\'t read or write GIF, but I use Jef Poskanzer\'s PBMPlus utilities
to convert to and from GIF, so it\'s not much of an obstacle.

BTW, xgedit is a pure raster editor and does not come with any "pre-
constructed" components, like most architectural design software.
Thus, if you want to design starship deckplans, you have to draw
everything from scratch.  This is not as hard as it sounds, as you
can design 1 acceleration couch a pixel at a time in the zoom editor,
and then replicate it (rotated as necessary) anywhare on the ship.
I found that only the first ship was hard to design (as I was creating
all the components for the first time.)  After that, I just cut-n-pasted
a lot of stuff from the first ship to subsequent designs.

I\'ve conducted TML surveys on two seperate occasions.  The most
favored image format is GIF by a long stretch, following (I *think*)
by EPS raster.  I\'m not sure about the second format, as I\'m typing
this from work and my notes are on my (unreachable from here) workstation
at home. :^(

If you want a standard GIF viewer for UNIX/X11 environments, your
best choice is XV.  The source is available by anon. ftp from
export.lcs.mit.edu (look in ~/pub/contrib.)  I\'m not sure about
PC platforms.  The PBMPlus utility source is also available in
that location.

I would be interested in a Regency discussion group as I have been
developing Gvurrdon for HIWG for more than two years now, with the
intent to get it published one day [dreaming].

I have updated Gvurrdon to TNE, and finds it natural to get some info
about what Regency are doing these days. It will surely affect what
happening in Gvurrdon.

BTW: Rodge, when are the stuff being mailed, and how much will it cost?

The TML was formed after I posted a note to rec.games.frp (now
rec.games.frp.misc) to see if there was any interest. I then went to my
UNIX Systems Admin and set up sendmail aliases (controlled by the system
admin) that referenced a file that I owned and could modify (via the
:include: directive). It\'s important to have a list, owner-list, 
list-request addresses in order to follow proper list etiquette. In that
file I listed the recipients. All that remained was to let the people
know it existed! The digesting, auto-reply, and other fancy stuff came
later (I recommend that only for a large list).

Administering the group means adding and deleting people from the
distribution file, answering questions, stirring the pot to keep
discussion going, and dealing effectively with bounced mail (which
sometimes takes technical savvy). I administer TML via remote,
programmatic additions and deletions from the list files on
engrg.uwo.ca. When it was on my own computer, I just used a text file
editor on the list.

By the way, today I added our 500th TML member: rfkm@aol.com (Hi RKFM,
pity I don\'t know your real name). It\'s prophetic that it\'s an AOL
address, AOL members have flooded the TML membership in the last year.
There are now 500 member addresses on the active list: 14 are on
temporary hiatus, 396 receive the nightly digest, 88 receive the
biweekly digest, and 6 receive the archive bundles; there are also 2
prospective new members awaiting address confirmation.

Ah, Wednesday night was a good one!  But first let me make a point about tone
in my postings.  I guess it seems to some folks that I\'m often \'bitching\' in
my replies because most of what I say in response takes issue with whomever I\'m
replying to.   Let me suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the
interest of bandwidth conservation, I seldom acknowledge something that I
agree with.  You can rest assured that if I only reply to 20%, or 50%, or 80%
of someone\'s ideas I probably agree with the bulk of what I *didn\'t* reply
to, even if most of what appears on TML takes issue with it.

Okay, on to Wednesday night\'s posts:

Another good point but just because the RC doesn\'t want to be an aristocracy
doesn\'t mean they know \'how\' to be a democracy.  This isn\'t a criticism, just
a fact that might lead to some interesting possibilities.  What happens
when disenfranchised groups (robots, cyborgs, former aristocrats?) start
clamoring for their share of the pie?

I don\'t know.  Eleven hundred years just for the Third Imperium kind of
overshadows our little 200+ year experiment here in America.

Yes, but the \'interstellar\' culture was aristocratic.  Nothing got done
on an interstellar level outside of the aristocracy.  Even the megacorps
(which were run by aristocrats, remember) looked to the aristocracy and
the aristocracy\'s Navy to police commerce.

Not me.  The non-eqalitarian aspect of the Imperium *always* bothered me.
The fact that there wasn\'t a truly egalitarian society anywhere in the
Imperium campaign was one of its greatest failings.

As for this discussion, I\'ve left the CT/MT vs. TNE arguement behind long
ago.  I\'ve been trying to just focus on the details of TNE.

Hmmm, I *guess* one *might* be able to blame the Virus on the aristocracy.(?)

If the RC is centralized and *effective* in foreign affairs then there isn\'t
much room for variation in the ranks.  A variety of opinions leads to a *lack*
of effective action.  The European Union in the former Yugoslavia hasn\'t
been effective at all.  Neither has the UN *anywhere*.  If the RCES is out
accomplishing things then generally it\'s operations from place to place
will be similar in nature - you won\'t have some Vikings doing \'good deeds\'
and some doing \'bad deeds\' and both coming back to the same company picnic.

Exactly.  What the European colonial powers did wasn\'t trade at all.  It was
resources extraction.  This may very well be what the RC is doing.  But then
it\'s \'chicken stealing\', and not \'enlightened development\'.  That\'s not a 
criticism in my view but it is different than some other folks\' view of the RC.

I agree.  I guess I was trying to take issue with the proposition that the
RC were \'enlightened\'.  Self-interest seldom has the long-term focus to
permit it to be \'enlightened\'.  In general, what\'s \'good\' for the RC when
it shows up at someone else\'s world won\'t be \'good\' for the locals.  I
guess I\'m still hooked on the \'Prime Directive\'.  :-)

A good point.  But \'pragmatism\' is not \'altruism\'.  Certainly the RC believes
it can force itself on its neighbors - or least protect itself from eventual
retribution.

Well, yes.  But the \'Iran-contra\' characters were eventually dealt with.  Such 
behavior has at least been criticized officially and is supposedly not
condoned - even if Ollie North may be a senator next year.  There may be
aberrations (even *Star Trek* has had rogue captains) but if the general
attitude of the RCES is \'benevolent\' then Vikings who err on the side of
\'malevolence\' too often will be removed.  Again, the pattern will generally
be one way or the other.  The only way both \'benevolent\' *and* \'malevolent\'
vikings will be common is with a fragmented, decentralized RC.

Not at all.  Don\'t think for a minute that I\'m trying to suggest that the
RC is somehow \'worse\' than the Imperium.  In fact, in the context of TNE,
this sort of comparison is irrelevant.  My view though is basically different
from Allen Shock\'s in that I don\'t see the Star Vikings as such good guys.
They may be a helluva lot of fun to play, but they won\'t be winning any
Nobel Peace Prizes soon.  :-)

They can\'t have both and be *effective*.  Certainly you have both sentiments
in the real world but in general self-interest dominates.  Look at the US,
which I like to believe is mostly a \'good\' guy.  We still spend only a fraction
of our efforts in humanitarian pursuits.  We\'re much better at forging an
international coalition to kill Iraqis than to feed Somalis.  If humanitarians
were as influential in our government as are \'pragmatists\' we would have
been just as *ineffective* in the Persian Gulf as we have been in Somalia.

This has been a great discussion - at least for me.  :-)  Some good points
to consider and debate.  Now if only we could expand it to the Regency and
the rest of TNE.

Although you are right in the general sense, in this particular case the
fault was on the part of your friend. There is a single line in one of 
the three original books that makes it clear that noble titles are
planetary titles (Something like: "There are two more levels above Duke,
Prince and King, and these are used for rulers of worlds"). Thus your
friend should not have been able to generate any Imperial noble.
Unfortunately that little detail got scrambled in Megatraveller; hence
the wierdness of having one Imperial baron and two knights in each
average-sized school class. If you check the adventures put out you 
will find Imperial barons serving as marine grunts and customs 
inspectors, totally contrary to my concept of Imperial nobility. I
wrote an article suggesting an alternate system of nobility (The Emperor
wound up as SL Y; this was not planned, it just worked out that way, but
I was kinda pleased that there would also be an appropiate SL for any
rulers of whole galaxies one might encounter). I sent it to Challenge, 
but unfortunately it arrived just as they closed their intake of 
Megatraveller stuff. Sigh... I have a suspicion that they didn\'t even
read it.

    'body' => 'Greetings,

People on the list were looking for some plot ideas / modules which GM\'s
had used.  The following is a description of an adventure I had drawn up
for my first game using the TNE rules.  I have played and GMed CT and MT
since 1979, mainly CT since I didn\'t see a copy of MT until 2 years ago.

Were I live (Darwin, in the Northern Territory of Australia) got it\'s
first gamimg supplies store about 2 years ago.  It can be hard to keep
track of changes when living in the middle of nowhere.  Anyway adescription
of the adventure.


The adventure plot:

It is based on a planet in an expanded system which is not the primary
planet.  The characters are being offered the job to investigate the
planet for the RCES.  All the details known about the planet is that any
ship reported as going there have never be sighted again. 

The details I used to make the characters accept the mission is a promise
to waiver the mortage fees on their ship for the duration, and a cut on
any goods found.  The RCES also reminded them that the government owned
a portion of the lease and the mortage.

The trip to the planet was fairly uneventful, mainly because I didn\'t want
to do space combat until I had Brillant Lances.

The situation on the planet was a team of psionic rebels had siezed control
about 70 years ago. Once in control they had set them selves up as gods and
had psionic priests in control.  These priest ran the planet through the power
of psionics.  Any member of the planet\'s population with psionic abilities
was immediately inducted into the priesthood.  Mean while the original psionic
rebels where using the low berths in their grounded ship to extended their 
lives.

The need to keep the low berths going meant they need spares.  To obtain these
spare they where luring ships to land and capturing them.  The method used
was similar to a virus attack.  The people below would welcome the starship
and transmitt the coordinates in binary.  A psionic using computer empathy
would enter the ships computer during the link and attempt to disable the
ships enviromental controls.

People on the planet are either rich, powerful psionic priests or peasants.
Some people amongst the lower class are staging a rebellion, and need off-world
assistance.  Also the priests speak normal Galanglic while the peasants speak
a dialect of galanglic.  To understand a peasant a character needs to make
a difficult skill check against linguistics.

The adventure was for the characters to land at the starport, be meet by the
High Priest, and invited to dinner.  At the dinner a rebel waiter drops a
contact note on a napkin to the Off-world(character) leader.  The note
is writen the local dialect.  From this point the PC\'s should contact the
rebels and try to overthrow the priests.

I am little bit sketchy at this point as the adventure didn\'t quite get
this far.  This is how the adventure ran.  When the characters equipped them
selves they all brought comabt armour with psionic shields.  The people I
play with are a little bit paranoid.  Also the RCES assigned to them a Hiver
computer specialist.

When the PC\'s made contact with the planet they feared a virus attack.  They
used a hand computer to receive the coordinates.  During the
transfer they noticed the virus like attempt and broke the connection.
The PC\'s decided to land at the starport anyway and did it without to many
problems.

After meeting the High Priest they decide to send some people to the dinner
and leave some to guard the ship.  They also noticed the other captured
ships at the starport.  There where many plans made to steal one of these
ships.

At the dinner everything was going fine until the rebel waiter dropped the 
note.  The PC leader failed his linguistics role and couldn\'t read it.  He
then gave the note to the High Priest and asked for an interpretation.  The 
High Priest claimed the note was for a meeting of a sexual nature with the 
waiter.

Mean while the PC\'s on the ship went investigating the other ships.  They 
dodged the guards left to keep an them safe.  (Some of the population was
xenophobic).  All of the ships they looked at where gutted of vital 
components, making them unspaceworthy.  As they where leaving a hanger, in
which one of the ships was stored, they encounter some natives.  The natives
where disabled with tranq rounds and hand-to-hand combat.

Unfortuately they attracted the guards attention, who come over to investigate.
The PCs tried to bluff there way out, (I can\'t remember the extact
unbelievable line they used).  The guards where looking for an excuse to bring
more equipment and personnel into the area to attack the PC\'s ship.  So they
lied and agreed to the PCs story.

Back at the dinner the PC\'s were asked to stay for the night in the palace
for discussions on trade in the morning.  After entering their room the PCs
decide to leave and had called up the ship\'s air raft to pick them up.
Just before the air raft arrived a rebel entered their room.  The rebel was
in the middle of telling his story when his was killed by a psionic assault
attack.  A psionic priest then burst into the room, just as the air raft 
arrived.  All the PC\'s in the room except one ran for the air raft.  

The one remaining PC tried to take on the psionic priest, missing.  The priest
then stunned the PC.  The others opened fire from the air raft using a
7mm Rotary Gun.  The stunned PC was in the burst area but the others didn\'t 
care.  The player on the gun fired five fifty round bursts at the priest.
The priest disappeared under about 60 to 100 dice of damage.  The stunned PC
took about 10 stray rounds but his comabt armour saved him from any serious
damage.

We didn\'t continue after this as one of the players went away for about 3 
months, and I haven\'t had the time to continue since he got back.

All I have to say in regards to this is that EPS deckplans are *awesome*, and
GIF deckplans are "okay".  As far as viewing them on the screen, and cross
platform compatability, VGS-res GIF images are probably the best.  Heck, every
luser seems to have half a dozen GIF viewers available.  I know that I have my
share (but of them I seem to use WinGif1.4 the most).  

As far as I am concerned, Postscript is *just* as cross-platform.  There are
versions of Ghostscript for almost every platform, and thats more than enough
to view the stuff.  On top of that, it is far more printer-compliant than GIF
will ever be.  Maybe I\'m just prejudiced because I have a PS-lvl2 laser printer
connected to my OS/2 machine.  Actually, all it takes is something like
Pagemaker to turn the nice deckplans for the Felicity into 25mm grid maps.  :)

Does anyone know of a util to convert GIF into EPS?

I\'m new to the list, and I have a question about MegaTraveller.

On page 82 of the Referee\'s Manual (step 7) it says that "The minimum bridge

Scout/Courier, Seeker, Free Trader, Far Trader, Subsidized Merchant, Yacht,
Laboratory Ship and Safari Ship, all have bridge crews of one. I couldn\'t
find any errata on this. What is the minimum bridge crew? 

Also, I\'ve noticed in the archive site that there are a lot of programs that

    'body' => '	One of the things I miss most about the Journal of the Traveler\'s
Aid Society (and lets face it TNE wimps, TAS is what *Traveller* is
really about) is the Amber Zone section. I still use them (like one
I used from issue 6 last week :-)
	For those of you who are too young to remember the Amber Zone
section was a short and simple plot outline. No great development but
enough detail to slot it in to a normal campaign.
	I\'ve posted the odd one in the past and when anyone bothered
to comment it was generally positive. So here we go again...


			ON THE ROCKS

	While on a layover or between jobs on Oca (A668A9B-C) the PCs
come across some data. It can be sold to them as "interesting" or
as a partial payment for their last job or if the are ex-Navy as a
tip. The data consists of the final transmission of a Navy fighter
on a mission about 30 years ago. It records it losing control while
flying NOE and the pilots ejecting. There is a partial radar scan/
transponder trace, showing its last trajectory.
	Accessing navy records will indicate the craft listed as lost.
If they can get at the site report it will conclude that although
the craft soft-landed a fusion plant leak melted the ice around it
and they measured it at 50m depth with a densiometer. It was never
recovered.
	The site itself is about 400km away from the Teo down starport
arcology. The local government is straightlaced so they will have
to apply for a surface-pass. Ambient temperature is -167C and winds
are frequently above 100kph. The ice-flats around it, though, are
used by the adventurous for Icerigging (boats with skates).
	Several problems complicate the recovery for the PCs. Firstly
the exact location of the crash is not known. The radar scan/transponder
trace will give a good indication and someone with navigation can
trail the trajectory to surface level.
	Secondly, fighters being heavier than ice, it has sunk over
the years, albeit slowly. It now resides at a depth of 500m. About
the only think that can detect it at this distance is a high
penetration densiometer. Even then there will be several shadows. And
it will be difficult to pinpoint unless they are right on top of it.
	Getting on top is difficult because over the years not only
has the fighter sunk but the ice has moved around it. On this sort
of ice-bound planet the mechanics of ice-sheet tectonics come somewhere
between plate movement and glacial deposition. Quite interesting if
you are a scout. Fortunately if they check out the local university
the rates of deposition/erosion as well as the ice-current for the
area are on record for the past several hundred years.
	Once located they mearly have to dig through half a kilometer
of ice to get at it. For those tempted to use the ship\'s lasers they
will just have to be reminded of the planet\'s law level and that they
will not be given permission, under any circumstance, to fly their ship
away from the starport let alone fire its weapons.
	Clever players will come up with a variety of ingenious methods
of digging through the ice. If they have rented icerigging gear
there will be a ice-hollowing unit included for setting up their
shelter. This is a micro-wave based emitter but its batteries are
really only enough for setting up the shelter a number of times.
Mechanically minded PCs could get this runing of a portable power
unit but it really would be slow progress. What they need is an
industrial strength one...
	If they inquire in the arcology they may find that the same company
that makes the sports model also makes larger models. These are generally
used in minining, construction and idustry and are quite expensive
(~100000Cr). If they nose around they may find a construction model
for hire (1000Cr/day). Back at the University they can wheedle the
one they use for core sampling for 10000Cr for as long as they want.
Unless a substansial deposit is put down they will want to send some
post-graduate along to keep an eye on it and get some experience.
	The units are fairly simple to operate, however their task is
not as simple as digging down 500m. Beneath the surface of the ice
it is not as cold as on the surface. The digger works by vapourising
the ice. On the surface this blows away. Near the surface it freezes
againt almost instantly, caking up whatever environmental suits they
are wearing. Deeper down the steam will condense on the walls. Where
does this water go? Downhill!
	If they dig straight down they will soon be in a pool of water.
The digger will eventually reach a point where it is just boiling the
water that has collected at the bottom and not making any real progress.
Digging on an angle (or a large spiral) will lesson this effect but
will still cause problems. If they can arrange a pump to pump the water
out as it condenses that will solve many things. Watch for the outflow of
the pump freezing up, though!
	As they make progress they will have a long tunnell carved through
solid ice. They will have to take special precautions to get in an out.
At a 1 in 10 slope it is a 5km bobsled slope from to to bottom. Try
carting a 300lb industrial melter up and down that each day.
	The last problem they will face is that the ice is not stationary.
It doesn\'t move fast but it does move. The effect of this is that the
gap they have dug will get a little narrower each day. They may notice
that it is a bit difficult to pull the melter out each night. Of course
they can always work a 24 hour shift (the melter melts a 1m diameter
tunnell 1m long in 1 minute) but they will have to clear it up again
before they get it back out.
	When they eventually reach the site of the wreck they will find
it still partially intact. The current of ice has strewn the debris behind
it so not all of it is there. If there are looking for specific components
I suggest a Routine densiometer ops roll. Failure indicates that it is
not there and is strewn along the debris trail.
	So what do they get for all this hard work? The navy will always
pay a bounty for recovery. Just the transponder will suffice. Maybe there
are personal effects that would be of great sentimental value to the
pilot (who may still be alive) or just any Navy collector. Any intact
systems in the craft would probably make reasonable spares.
	I reccomend that between the Navy bounty and the salvage sale the
PCs should make about 1% of the original worth of the craft. Clever PCs
may flog off bits of it in clever ways and should deserve more. (Like
selling the 500m ice core to the scouts?)
	Possible side lines: What about the previously unknown creatures
that live and burrow beneath the ice? Very well to do and nosy iceriggers
could always drop by for a cup of tea. What if the ice-sheet only caps a
unfrozen ocean and the fighter is near the bottom?

	If you are a sad individual and play TNE you can still use this. Just
throw in a bunch of down-and-outers. Make the crash 300 years ago. Overplay
the need for spares. And don\'t forget to tell them what a wonderful furure
they are working toward and how much they can play a part...

I\'m not so sure about that.  Let\'s take a quick look at what each major
group knows about the rest of the universe:

o Does the RC know that the Regency and the other Spinward states exist?

No; they\'re not aware of the Regency (or rather, have almost certainly
assumed that all of known space looks more or less like the area around the
Reformation Coalition does).  They have no evidence or indication to assume
otherwise, so they\'re almost certainly working off of the premise that the
largest "opposition" that they are going to encounter is the Guild and/or
other Pocket Empires.  Given their Hiver technical assistance, the RC should
be a match for any pocket empire they encounter.

o Do the Hivers?

The Hivers probably have a clue.  They know the most about the former Third
Imperium - the "History Club" that toured the region during the end of the
Rebellion for example.  They are certainly aware that the Domain of Deneb
existed (relatively) untouched by the Rebellion.  They can assign a
probabiliy (and I\'d guess a high one) to the chance that the Domain still
exists in some form.  Furthermore, since the Hivers managed to muddle
through the Virus without suffering complete collapse, either the Hivers
are so ethnocentric that they believe no other race could have done it, or
the hivers consider it probable that other races or regions could have
survived in a condition similar to the Hive Federation.

o Does the Regency know about the survival of the Hive Federation?

Because of the Regency\'s closed border policy, they probably know very
little about what the universe at large looks like.  However, they will have
to concede the possibility of other regions taking measures similar to the
ones that they have taken, and surviving with a similar situation.

Presumably, there is currently an ongoing debate in the Regency over the
probability of such other surviving areas, and whether it would be better to
expend some of the Regency\'s resources to attempt to contact other regions,
or remain behind the Regency\'s secure borders until other areas attempt to
contact the Regency.

o About the RC?

Not at all.  The Reformation Coalition is a pocket empire (perhaps even a
typical one, except that it is recieving Hiver technical assistance).
There\'s no way the Regency could know about it at this point.

    'body' => 'Hi Readers,

Just wanted to let you in on my current MegaTraveller (I guess) adventure. 
I haven\'t played much lately and don\'t know the official background of the
Ancients but here\'s the deal.  

Some friends of mine go hiking in Canada (roleplaying themselves) and awake
to discover that a spaceship is landing out on an island in the georgian
bay.  they decide to ignore it and can\'t get through to anyone on the radio
so they are considering leaving when the gang from Blue Book show up to
study the thing.  Of course these "earth defense forces" simply begin
shooting my characters with a long range taser to knock them out and get
them out of the way when the Characters are misteriously transported into
the ship.  Well,  the ship is a tech TL23 or whatever built by the
Grandfather (Ancients) himself to go to early earth to get some
"primative"/ or pure human DNA samples and/or psionic brain prints.  En
route the ship was attacked by an AI missle designed by the "children" to
intercept the ship and render it inactive by whatever means necessary.  The
missle is "programmed" to be a tactical genius which means it was able to
out fly and eventually attach itself to the Ship and inject micromachines
that disable ship systems and repair robots on the Ship.  Of course the
Ship is run by a Triumvarate of AI\'s whom all have personallity quirks and
aren\'t getting along at the moment.  This lack of cooperation is the
fundemental reason the Triumvarate is unable to remove the invading
computer.  Another importent note is that the missle has done its job and
the "Children\'s Fleet" backing it up in hopes of capturing the Ship never
showed up for reasons unbeknowst to the missle.  After years of limping
through space and time the Ship finally makes it to earth and the Missle AI
is beginning to get depressed, "I did my job and look what I get for my
troubles."  

SO the Character are teleported on board and are addressed by one of the
Ship\'s AI\'s if they wouldn\'t mind helping out in some repairs.  Of course,
they first have to lay back and relax in the "Accelaration" couches to
receive instruction on how to help.  I used this as a device to allow the
characters 3-4 levels of skills involving engineering, computing, piloting,
commo, etc.  I rolled success task and for partial success I had the
characters get only 1-2 skills but latent psionic skills become active. 
Cool huh?  

One of the main problems with getting the ship off the ground was that it
barely had enough fuel to get in orbit let alone jump anywhere.  So I had
the player bargain with the missle AI for some of its antimatter fuel for
some of the information on the Ship\'s computers concerning the "CHildren". 
I used the genetic end-dates from Blade Runner idea but official
information on the Ancients and there conflict may lend other information
to be importent.  Well after a mild skirmish with US gnd forces the Ship
takes off intercepts a few nuclear missles the russians shot from an
orbiting station with its black globe and jumps into hyperspace.  At this
point the player have lost all control of the ship\'s computer\'s and are
just along for the ride.  Going through a "Children\'s" blockade the
characters finally get to Grandfather\'s black hole/pocket universe and are
examined by the head man itself. It looks at them with whatever
superabilities It has and them tells them they can go home.  A polite robot
asks them to return all property that is the grandfather\'s ie all the high
tech stuff the pocketed from the ship and then asks them if the missle is
their\'s.  Well it certainly isn\'t the grandfather\'s why should the robot be
concerned about it.  They repond of course it is and the robot tells them
it will be marked for delivery and asks them to step through this door.

Well, somehow the characters are unceramoniously dumped at and an old alien
installation somewhere in the traveller universe with an intelligent
missle.  The "warp field" around the pocket universe caused time to advance
several millenia and the character are now in the Imperium, or Rebellian,
or somewhere sometime.  I have been considering the idea that maybe the
real cause of the virus is this tech 21 AI on the missle.  Or maybe it
saves a planet from being infected by the virus and the planet rewards the
character with there last remaining 40 year old partially operational Scout
ship.  Or the character adventure around for awhile in the rebellion and
when they meet the virus the AI which they installed in some ship barely
manages to put them all in stasis before it becomes brainfried.  Etc.

What do you guys think?  A rather crazy, and powerful beginning but I think
it has some promise.  Imagine trying to fix a tech 13 jump drive with tech
9 and tech 23 engineering skills.  What do you mean its not sagashiating
correctly doesn\'t it have a kanootin valve?  Shit...try hitting it with a
hammer!

Take Care,

   I too have enjoyed thse discussions about the Star Viking background. There
is one thing which bothers me, though. You are effectively trying to lead a
discussion about this without yourself having done any research on the
subject. You haven\'t read Path of Tears, or any of the material in the rulebook
which pertains to the RC. This would be much akin to trying to lead a literary
discussion without knowing anything about the author or his/her writings. Time
and again, I can\'t help but think your understanding of these issues-and even
your ability to play Devil\'s Advocate-would be enhanced if you would simply buy
Path of Tears and read it. If you then decide you don\'t care for TNE, I know
two people you could sell your copy to if no one on the TML wants it.
   You seem to be interested in this "good vik, bad vik" thing. The RC is
like any other government; it can fall prey to corruption and infighting, and
the danger of this is already evident in the war of words between the Centrists
and the Federalists. However, the RCES sets standards for it\'s troops;according
to the book, they want to avoid the reputation for being as bad or worse than
the invaders from previous times (the Solomani and the Imperium) were. They
are spread very thin, however, and must sometimes hire freelancers and THEY
don\'t have to follow accepted RCES procedures. This combined with propaganda
from the Star Guild (who coined the name "Star Vikings" to conjure up just the
sort of negative imagery that it seems to invoke in many people around here)
is what results in the view that history will have of the RCES, as denoted in
several "future history" extracts in both the TNE rules and Survival Margin.
As is the case with any organization, there will be "bad apples", but the
stated goal of the RC is to be the "good guys", according to what has been
written thus far.
  Someone else (Cynthia, I think) mentioned the inevitible collapse of RC
ecomomies if they continue to be based solely on recovered technology. This is
very true, and the RC knows this, which is why the recovered tech is often used
to allow an enhancement of local manufacturing techniques. Aubaine is the only
starport in the RC which can build starships which are jump-capable, largely
because of Hiver technical assistance and recovered technology.  RC worlds ARE
working on building up their manufacturing techniques and recovering lost tech
levels;they simply feel that they don\'t have 200-300 years to wait. Will it
work? I don\'t know; that\'s part of what we\'ll find out, I suppose. The Regency
has a similar problem; they have better manufacturing tech, and a higher
overall technology level, but are simply running out of room for their economy.
Their overly paranoid fear of Virus has locked them in, and the economy will
bottom out soon unless they expand. So, the RC has to move beyond "chicken
stealing" (again, POT is fairly clear that the RCES does NOT take tech from
planets that need it! They take it only from dead worlds (now we\'ll hear the
accusations of grave-robbing...), despots and derelicts!) and into a more
profitable manufacturing mode, and the Regency simply needs more room, more
trading partners. A recipe for trouble when they meet? of course! It would
not be any fun otherwise...
   As for the criticisms which seem to say that the RCES has no right to
force planets to join-no one does! However, it has happened many times, not
only throughout our history, but through the fictional Traveller universe\'s
history as well. Students of this fictional history will recall the years
76-120; the Pacification Campaigns, during which the Third Imperium told many
worlds within it\'s sphere of influence, "Hello. You\'re going to join our Empire
now. And if you don\'t, we\'ll blockade you and have our diplomats harangue you
until you join. And if that doesn\'t work, we\'ll just invade you and MAKE you
join." They were not alone in this; the Vilani Consolidation Wars starting in
the year -5400 were essentially the same thing. I\'m sure the Rule of Man did
likewise. So why is the RC any different?
  Is the RC more "enlightened" than the Imperium? Probably not, but they THINK
they are, just as we call ourselves "the land of the free" when large parts of
our population still experience problems just because of some stupid little
thing like the presence or absence of a chemical called melanin in their skin!
Can they BECOME more enlightened, or will internal pressures replace idealism
with cynical practicality? We\'ll see...

This is quite a problem. I would rule that if the ship are of such a
small size a lone bridgecrew would manage the ship far as it is unarmed.
Soon as you put on a weapon there should be either a gunner or a second
bridge crew. Unless you rule that another crewmember are not needed in a
position during a fight, and can man the turret then. Stewards and
maintenance crew fits in here. The main thing is what do you find most
appropriate for your campaign?

 I _did_ read that particular passage, Scott, and I remarked to
 Dave Nilsen at the time that this sentence would be quoted at me
 sometime in the near future... : )
 
 The reason I went on to remark to Matt that our intention was
 not to allow small arms versions of PAs and Meson guns was that I
 thought there was room for ambiguity in that statement (which I,
 Frank, and Dave all interpret as requiring beam pointers in all
 PAs and meson guns).
 
 I will suggest that we amend the sentence to read as follows:
 
 "All particle accelerators, meson guns, and heavy (non-
 small arms) lasers require beam pointers..."
 
 Other than that Scott, I found it an interesting series of
 designs, particularly the anti-boarder weapon (referees intending
 on using this fiendish device should bear in mind that what\'s
 sauce for the NPC is sauce for the PC, however, and should apply
 it with equal vigor to opposing PC boarders). BTW, I made the
 Ghostbusters remark because (if I recall correctly) backpack
 particle accelerators figure prominently in both movies.

 Yes. Schalli, Hivers and Ithklur will definitely be in it.
 Don\'t know who else yet (a lot of that depends on size
 constraints).
 
 Regarding the recent settlement between TSR and GDW (among
 other parties): A large number of rumors are circulating about
 this matter. I ask that you not clutter up the TML with
 discussion of them, but if anybody wants the truth about what
 happened, send me E-mail. I _will_ say that nobody got "screwed"
 by the settlement, and the rumors that GDW is going out of
 business as a result of the settlement are totally baseless.

    Suject:  TNE: What does the future hold?
    From  :  Jeff Freeman

I thought that the direction in which The Viral-Imperium was
headed had already been decided -- just from reading the TNE
rulebook.

I refer to the shaded box of background blurbs on page 82.

Here\'s what I learned from this:

One, The Regency outlives the Star Vikings.  The first entry
is from "Regency Sector Governor..." and speaks of the Star
Vikings in the past tense.  This with the date NE 44.

Two, Dr. Elinor speaks of the Star Vikings, also in the past
tense (NE 135).  The striking thing about this entry is the
location of the source:  Diaspora!

Lastly, all four entries are *defending* the Star Vikings\'
methods (or at least, their motives) -- from what?  General
consensus or popular opionion is my guess.

Observation:  If the Star Vikings fight the Regency (and I
agree completely, they must!) then the winner will go down in
history as "the good guys".  They will need no defense by
acadamians such as these.  The losers, apparently the RC,
would be vilified... to the point that some generations later
scholars would feel the need to set the record straight.

Compare:  American Indians.  For several generations,
Indians were regarded as Evil savages, (cowboys were held as
icons of virtue).  Only in the past 10 or so years have there
been attempts to paint the Indian\'s as noble environmentalists.
Probably the Indians were more like people, with good and
bad -- but the point is that the settlers *won*, and therefore
needed no moral defense.  They were recorded as "The Good
Guys".  Had the Indians succeeded in pushing Europeans from
American soil, no doubt the situation would be opposite.

From these background blurbs it seems clear that the Regency
must have swept down and reclaimed The Imperium -- in a matter
of 45 years!?  In only 135 years the push was on to honor the
Star Vikings as something other than plundering murderers.

In away, this is good news for the "Down with TNE, Long Live
the Imperium" crowd.  Push ahead 50 years and your beloved
Imperium is back... slightly more democratic (q.v. Changes in
the Regency), but The Imperium nontheless.

Sounds like we should move over to "alt.politics.comparative"!  :-)

Seriously though, I agree with your point and didn\'t mean to compare the
contemporary US with the EU except to illustrate, WRT the Reformation
Coalition, exactly the point that a new, fragmented government isn\'t going
to be as effective in it\'s foreign affairs as an established, centralized
one.

Okay, but *then* I don\'t feel it\'s realistic to expect that the RCES (or any
other body of the RC) is going to function effectively - there is going to
be a lot of second-guessing, rescoping and retrenching going on back home.
The early US under the Articles of Confederation and during the first several
decades under the Constitution was not much of an international player at
all - much like the EU today.  NASA is another good example today - when
there is no consensus there is very little action.  Twenty-five years after
the Apollo moon landings NASA doesn\'t even have regular, reliable access
to low-earth orbit.

\'Cause the the Imperium had a much bigger, TL15 stick?  A single battalion of
Imperial Marines could pretty much cow any but the highest pop and tech
worlds.

Well, okay.  I\'m sure Boris Yeltsin could get his hands on a copy of the
US Constitution if he tried.  Do you suppose he could just wave it in front
of Rutskoi and Zhironovsky and they\'d become `democrats\'?  I guess what I
should have asked is "how has the idea that `Jane Everybody\' has just as
much say as `Peter Plutocrat\' become widely held among the citizens of the
Coalition (or the Regency) - especially among `Peter\' and his chums?"

> Your view of the RC suffers from the fact that you haven\'t read Path of Tears.

This is probably the case.  But keep in mind that just because GDW writes
something in a sourcebook doesn\'t mean it makes sense or is consitent with
any sort of realistic situation.  Just because they describe a fragmented,
`coalition\' government as being an effective `international\' agent doesn\'t
mean Italy and Brazil are going to become world-class players next week.

Then again, in a 2D universe (here we go again) anything might be possible. :-)

> the RC don\'t steal high-tech gear off people who are using it correctly i.e.

Etc.,

> This doesn\'t sound like \'chicken stealing\' to me.

Me neither.  The Coalition may not be `chicken stealers\' at all.  *My*
point was that, with the sort of stable, centralized government that
was claimed for the Coalition (and this may also be at issue it appears now)
I didn\'t see it as realistic that the RCES could be *both* the `chicken
stealers\' that some say are suggested by *Survival Margin* (I haven\'t read
*it* either!) and the `peace corps\' that has been suggested by others.  Sure,
both elements may exist, but with a stable, central government one or the
other *will* predominate.  *I* don\'t know whether the Coalition government is
stable and centralized or not.  But *if* it is, then the general attitude
of the RCES will be *either* benevolent *or* malevolent - but again, *I*
don\'t know which.  I do know it won\'t be both - unless the government is
*unstable* and fragmented.  What about not having read *Path of Tears* draws
into question the validity of this arguement?  (Except that if `GDW says
it\'s so\' then logic is irrelevant?)

Should we take a poll?  Those of you who have read *Path of Tears*: is the
Coalition government stable and central, unstable and fragmented, or somewhere
in between?  And if it\'s stable and central, is the RCES the `chicken
stealing Star Vikings\' or the `exploring Peace Corps\'?

> Vietnam, Granada and Panama.  Is the U.S. government an \'altruistic

More like an `800 pound gorilla\'.  :-)  But this illustrates my point well.
The *annual* US foreign aid budget is dwarfed by just the cost of either the 
Grenada or Panama incursions.  (`Millions of dollars\' sounds like a lot to
folks like me, but in the realm of US military operations it\'s `chicken feed\'
if you\'ll pardon the pun.)  The US is sort of too big for `chicken stealing\'
but we do insist on `getting our way\' regardless of what folks think else-
where.  Both `altruistic\' and these `pragmatist\' attitudes exist in our
government but clearly the `pragmatist\' attitude is dominant.  And because 
we\'re stable and centralized that `pragmatist\' view is generally effective
in achieving its ends.

This seems to suggest that the Coalition government might *not* be stable
and centralized.  If this is the case, each bloc may be able to `protect\' 
RCES groups which carry out each\'s particular `mission\'.  This would
allow both the `good viks\' and the `bad viks\' to exist and in relatively
equal strengths but overall RCES effectiveness might then suffer because
the separate groups might often find themselves at odds and working at
cross purposes.  This, IMHO, sound like a *more* interesting setting
that a stable government with either a `benevolent\' or `malevolent\' RCES.
With all those guns and `take charge\' types around though the Coalition
might even be heading for a `rebellion\' (civil war) of its own!  This setting,
while not very original, might be still more fun to adventure in.

Good guess.  Or something equally `original\' like, "I am Lucan of Virus.
You will be assimilated.  Resistance is futile . . . ."  The orcs are
coming, the orcs are coming . . . .  :-)

Well, I don\'t suppose the Romans let those who didn\'t agree (and yet somehow
managed to avoid a centurion\'s blade) write too many history texts.

Well, yes, but `assimilated\' is an interesting word.  You may choose to
`assimilate\' to my culture but if I *insist* you `assimilate\' you might
call it `decimate\' - assuming you survived the `assimilation\'.  With 
`modern\' examples we have better access to views other than those of the
`conquerors\' than is the case with more historical examples.  Not too many
Gauls or Seleucids alive today but plenty of Ibos, Hmongs and Lakotas.

Again, for those that `survived\' the process of `assimilation\'.  We may have
strayed over to "alt.history.political" but the point I guess, WRT
the Reformation Coalition, is that if they choose to practice this sort
of `assimilation\' then, regardless of how they\'re portrayed in their
history books, we\'d be hard pressed to describe them as `benevolent\' in
TNE (at least I would be).

My question was not really `where this came from?\' but rather `how it came
about?\'.  Were all the former Imperial aristocrats guillotined (sp?) by
the founders of the Dawn League?  Democratic principles don\'t take hold
over night and the `Peter Plutocrats\' don\'t just give up without a fight.
(Just ask Vladimir Zhironovsky.)  Regardless of the effects of the Rebellion,
Virus and subsequent collapse the Imperial aristocrats, but virtue of their
control of the greatest amount of resources, should have been best situated
to begin rebuilding.  Now, either they `got religion\' and became `democratic\'
(doubtful without a working example to enlighten them - would Yeltsin still be
a `democrat\' if the West was aristocratic?) or someone displaced them like
the French revolutionaries did Louis XVI.

 The Hivers made initial contact with what eventually became the
 Dawn League and the RC.  It\'s pretty well documented that the
 Hivers have ulterior motives, primarily that of not having
 xenophobic high tech autocracies in a position to hassle the Hive
 Federation.  Thus, the Hivers work with the RC to create stable
 governments, and in the process, influence the "direction" that
 the RC develops to suit their (the Hivers) needs.  Remember, the
 Hivers are already established as psychologists extraordinaire.

 Yes, it\'s more "democratic" (which I interpret to mean simply that
 there is more open communication and opportunity for feedback on
 issues that are politically sensitive and not time-critical, such
 as border control and expansion), but it\'s also smaller than the
 3I was.  If/As it expands, there will be _either_ less of this
 "democracy" _or_ a general trend toward decentralization (more
 powerful archdukes and/or sector dukes, or generally a philosophy
 of the higher you are in the hierarchy, the more you are concerned
 with overall policy direction rather than policy itself or
 operations).  In either case, you will tend to have a situation
 that follows old, comfortable patterns, which in the case of the
 Regency means the old 3I model.  But that doesn\'t stop you from
 modifying it to meet the needs of the governed...

T::>>   This will lead to a situation much like we see on

T::>I\'m not so sure.  Remember that high technology is basically a

 But that\'s exactly why I use present day Terra as a comparison 
 point.  The 3I was in no way homogeneous - either technologically 
 or culturally.  And at low tech levels, the differences will be 
 magnified, simply because technology is something of a 
 bootstrapping process - each little bit you get is a foundation 
 for a somewhat larger bit.  That\'s why pundits always characterize 
 technological growth as an exponential curve.  Certainly, it is 
 expected to level off at some point, but we don\'t know where 
 that point will be.  But the Collapse threw the 3I worlds back to 
 pretty low tech levels, and some of them will have been fortunate 
 enough to (a) have a cache of low-tech reference materials (a.k.a. 
 paper books), (b) be in an area that is relatively free of vampire 
 ships (as opposed to the Promise Main in Diaspora), and (c) have 
 avoided developing rabid xenophobia and/or technophobia.  These 
 worlds will form the nuclei of pocket empires or Reformation 
 Coalitia.  But you\'ll still have the dominant high-tech nucleus 
 with other worlds acting strictly as feeders for one or another 
 necessary foundation material.

 And it is quite clear, and natural, that the GDW-designed

 with that.

 Except that there is a lot of xenophobia that has developed, and 
 the technological tradition and cultural background wasn\'t all 
 that firmly entrenched on all of the worlds.  Remember, the static 
 Vilani culture was in control of most of Imperial space for a lot 
 of years; that\'s one culture that does not encourage innovation.  
 The Solomani made an impact on that culture far out or proportion 
 to its numbers, due to the encouragement of technological 
 development.  But the Solomani veneer can be expected to be quite 
 thin, as it was really only around for a couple of thousand years 
 (part of which was the Long Night - which saw many of the same 
 problems that the Wilds see now.)

 But classical cultures were the foundation for the Dark Ages 
 culture in the first place, and was more homogeneous than the 3I 
 was.  This is the point that you\'re overlooking.  While there were 
 definitely failures of policy, it\'s pretty clear that 
 _culturally_, the policy of the 3I was to step back and let them 
 go their own way.  They simply must follow a minimum set of rules 
 (i.e., no nukes, no slaves, and no violating extrality...), but 
 within those very broad constraints, freedom.  How else could 
 you have had TL4 charismatic dictatorships in the same Imperium as 
 TL 10 religious oligarchies and TL15 participating democracies? - 
 and think just how different the cultures that support these 
 different governments must be.

 Mentioned in Arrival Vengeance.  Caches of resources that the 
 Emperor (or an archduke, perhaps; never really established) could 
 release to start massive public works projects in an economically 
 troubled area.  When Strephon essentially abdicated in Norris\'s 
 favor, he handed over the information and "passwords" as well.  

 Also mentioned was Longbow, which was hinted at as being possibly 
 a communications project of some sort, and one that may very well 
 be involved with psionics.  One of Strephon\'s comments to Norris 
 in connection with this was to watch the Zhodani, as they may 
 know.  Or some such comment as that; I\'d have to look it up, and 
 AV isn\'t handy at the moment.

 No, it seems to be a little more complicated than that.  It seems 
 that there was one ship that got through the cordon, and as a 
 result, the planet of Gram suffered.  Badly.  The fallout from 
 that was that the _public_ perception (though not necessarily at 
 the highest levels of government) was that it was too dangerous, 
 from a Virus standpoint.  Also remember that they have to guard 
 the entire Vargr border.  Expansion into Corridor lengthens that 
 border, and it may not be feasible to maintain "adequate" border 
 controls.

 The J5 Route across the Rift leads from the Aslan Spinward 
 Colonies to what used to be the main body of the Hierate.  It\'s 
 not Norris\'s to exploit.  The Spinward Aslan may very well look to 
 Norris with much respect, and be inclined to follow his advice, 
 but they do not subordinate themselves to him, any more than the 
 Zhodani do.

 Different attitudes, different responses to a situation.  There 
 are people that did not find it credible that the US had no 
 interest in incorporating foreign countries into a US-controlled 
 (as opposed to merely dominated) empire.  Nevertheless, the US 
 never used this model, whereas it was the typical Soviet/Russian 
 model.  Nobody thought that the Terran upstarts could beat the 
 long-established Vilani empire, either.  Yet the Rule of Man 
 happened anyway.

 Unlikely.  They wouldn\'t have had any defenses against Virus, 
 except distance.  And the Hivers were just as far, for the most 
 part.  The Hivers got bit, and only their sophisticated knowledge 
 of computers saved them.  Relations between the Hive Federation 
 and the Two Thousand Worlds were not so good that the Hivers would 
 have gone out of their way to help the 2KW.  Thus, the 2KW 
 suffered the same fate as the Aslan Hierate, the Solomani 
 Confederation, and the Third Imperium.

 Well, yes and no.  I think it depends more on the _cultural_ 
 attitudes than the _political_ ones.  And the two cultures are 
 very definitely at odds.  I don\'t see such drastic changes in 
 _either_ so as to be able to avoid these confrontations, and it\'s 
 not good for source material development, either.  I don\'t believe 
 it\'s a question of "_Will_ the wars happen"; I believe that it\'s a 
 question of "_When_" and "_Where_" they will happen.

 Consider what happened with technological development here on 
 Terra.  Whatever nation/empire, throughout history, was currently 
 on top, spread its culture throughout the "known world".  First 
 the Greeks, then the Romans, then the Italians and French, then 
 the Spanish and Portuguese, then the English and Germans, then the 
 Soviets and Americans.  With technological dominance and higher 
 education comes cultural dominance as well.  It\'s not a question 
 of _forcing_ the cultures into the RC or Regency mold; if that\'s 
 what I said or implied, please forgive me.  What I was thinking 
 was that the dominated cultures would be "exsimilated" into the 
 dominant culture, much the way American culture is now pretty much 
 global.  Yes, there will always be some elements of prior 
 cultures, and some of those aspects will be absorbed into the 
 dominant culture, but by-and-large, the "lesser" cultures change 
 to conform to the dominant.

 You assume that both will perceive it as an enemy.  All we know 
 right now is that the feeder leads corewards, and any planet that 
 starts to develop is sacked before it gets too far.  We thought 
 that the RC would be all bad, too, when all we knew about them was 
 that they were called "Star Vikings"...

that Sol. It\'s radius is 2.25 times Sool, while its total luminosity is 8.28
x 10^23 kw [2.125 sol]
The mass of this star is 1.5 times that of the sun. It\'s color index is
+0.45, giving it an effective surface temperature of 6,600 K.
          STAR B: Spectral Class K3v. This is a cool organge star with a
radius 0.873 that of the sun and a mass of 0.7 sol.This star\'s total
luminosity is 1.79 x 10^22, or just under 5%
of the sun\'s luminosity. It\'d color indesx is +1.10, giving it an effective
temperature of 4,150 K. 
          Both stars have five planets in orbit around them, the "Main"
planet is a double world
discribed in detail below which circles the "B" componet of the system. A and
B revolve around each other in a 38 year period.
          The planets of both systems receive heat energy from both stars,
therefor it is necessary when estimating the amount of energy receieved by a
planet to take into account not only the primary star around which the planet
orbits, but also the radiation from the companion star. This is especially
important for planets in the "B" solar system.
          {Note:} I use the total sub-solar temperature [Tss] of a planet as
a way of estimating if it gets enough solar radiation to support an 
"earth-like" climate. The earth\'s sub-solar temperature is 395 K.

          The number four orbit slot in the "B" star system is filled by an
exotic double planet,
named Mega Earth and False Earth. They revolve around each other in a
circular orbit
242,580 kilometers in radius. False Earth completes a full revolution around
Mega Earth 
once every 145 hour, 57 minutes, 23.614 seconds.
MEGA EARTH. Called thus because of it\'s large radius of 15,093 km [2.37
earth]. A lack of
heavy metals and metals in general gives this world an average density oof
only 3.98 gm/cm^3. The surface gravity is 1.058 that of earth. 60 percent of
Mega Earth is covered by 
30-100 km deep water oceans in which live a wide array of both plants and
animals. The atmospher is rich in Nitrogen and Oxygen, whith traces of CO2,
H2O and Ar [vertually identical to earth.]
FALSE EARTH. This planet is virtually identical to earth in size, mass,
atmosphere, and richness of its ecology. The climate on both worlds ranges
from Arctic [-50 C] to cool temperate [+4 C to +18 C]. 
Neither world has a native sentient life form, but there are traces of
ancient {>10^7 yrs}
ruins of a high tech civilization scattered across the surface of False
Earth. 
Visually, Mega Earth looks like a sphere 7 degrees in diameter, or 14 times
the diameter of the full moon from False Earth, and False Earth looks to be 3
degrees in diameter from Mega Earth. Since both planets have a "CLASS M"
[oops, that\'s from another game!] enviroment, both would be suitable for
colonization.

Well, I wouldn\'t say I haven\'t done anything.  I do read what the rest of
y\'all are posting - closely and with a great deal of interest.  I also am
a little uncomfortable with the idea of `leading\' the discussion.  Maybe I
just post too much and need to get a life.  :-)

It\'s true I haven\'t read *Path of Tears* or *any* of the other TNE material
but, having actually lead a literary discussion or two in my day, I would
propose that one *can* examine another\'s presentation of a particular work
for internal consistency and reasonableness without having read the actual
work itself.  When someone points out that my understanding of the facts
of the RC (or any other aspect of TNE) are incorrect I have revised my
opinions, but again just because some GDW product says such and such doesn\'t
necessarily make it gospel.  My own interest in background stems from a
fascination with the need to keep any setting believable and consistent.
IMHO, GDW has stuggled with this sort of problem, as would be expected in
any multi-collaborative work, since the days of Classic Traveller.

Well, I might understand the `facts\' better but I feel pretty comfortable 
with the `issues\' (such as the effectiveness of a stable, central government
versus that of an unstable, fragmented one) now.  How would being in possession
of *Path of Tears* or any other TNE product better help one to understand
these sort of issues except to be able to say, "But GDW says so on page XX"?
If there\'s some specific issue you believe I\'m not getting because I don\'t
have the rulebook please let me know what it is.

> If you then decide you don\'t care for TNE, I know

Well, I\'m not going to buy it.  If this means I can\'t `play\' just let me
know and I\'ll shut up.  :-)  I\'d like to think I can still discuss the
background without having to buy in to the product.  Maybe we should move
our discussion on to the Regency and other areas and then this issue of
what\'s in the GDW `bible\' wouldn\'t be relevant?  It seems to me though that
most folks are unwilling to discuss the Regency much because GDW hasn\'t
weighed in yet with a sourcebook.  If this is how things are going to be
then why discuss anything?  We can all just wait for the next sourcebook
for GDW to tell us what\'s going on.

>    You seem to be interested in this "good vik, bad vik" thing. 

Well, actually, no.  What I\'ve been trying to insist upon is consistency.
My own view is that a fragmented Coalition with `empire-builders\' (Centrists?)
and `altruistic developers\' (Federalists?) competing for control is the most
interesting but I don\'t see this as being possible with a stable, centralized
government.  I don\'t know how exactly reading *Path of Tears* would settle this
issue. I\'ve read reviews of *PoT* here on TML that have come down on *both*
sides of the fragmented/centralized Coalition government issue.

My point is that regardless of what the pols back home are pontificating about
if the RCES is being truly effective then it is getting consistent direction
and the debates in the Assembly are largely irrelevant.  If this is the case,
then the RCES is either going to be generally `benevolent\' *or* `malevolent\',
but not both.  Under these conditions my preference would be to play the RCES
as `benevolent\'.

On the other hand, if the Assembly debates are affecting the RCES mission
then the RCES will suffer from a lack of consistent direction and both 
`benevolent\' *and* `malevolent\' vikings will exist and each will enjoy 
succor from its respective bloc.  The overall RCES mission will be less
effective under these conditions but the adventure potential is enhanced in
my view.

The RCES may set standards but those standards, or at least the degree to which
they are enforced, will depend upon the direction received from the govern-
ment (this is a result of that wonderful `democracy\' stuff).

A nice excuse but if the RCES is `benevolent\' then abuses will be minimized
as the `abusers\' are not retained or disciplined and other potential `abusers\'
learn that abuses won\'t be tolerated.  On the other hand, if abuses *do*
continue and become the pattern then one has to question the motivations of
the RCES itself.

What I suspect is really going on here is the `rehabilitation\' of the RCES
by GDW.  Early releases painted them as bloodthirsty `Space Vikings\' but
subsequent thought felt this might not be a favorable enough image.  (Sort 
of like when the producers of the third *Star Wars* film forced Paramount
to change the name of *Star Trek II* from "The Vengeance of Khan" to "The
Wrath of Khan" to avoid conflict with the working title of the third *Star
Wars* film, "Revenge of the Jedi" which was subsequently changed when someone
belatedly pointed out that `revenge\' was `not the Jedi way\'.)

Fine.  Goals are nice.  But the character of the Coalition government is going
to affect the actual *conduct* of the RCES much more than any set of goals.
This is not a criticism but rather an realistic expectation that, IMHO, can
lead to some very interesting adventure possibilities.

Okay, let\'s discuss the Regency for a moment.  I\'m not sure I agree that the
Regency has to continue to expand in order to survive (sounds like Reaganomics
to me!) but assuming it *wants* to expand it faces several challenges besides
the threat of the Virus.  (And be warned, the following views are expressed
without the benefit of access to the `official\' TNE material.)  The Regency
must be secure that no threat will arise from the Zhodani, the Aslan or
the Vargr.  It must be convinced that whatever gains are to be made by
expanding into regions devastated by the Virus will offset the risk involved
in venturing into these `unclean\' regions.  It must be convinced that the 
exisiting Virus quarantine will be maintained and that it will not have to
deal with an incursion of the Virus into the interior.  It must be prepared
to accept the possibility of encountering a hostile major power that makes
similar claims to the legitimacy and heritage of the Imperium.

BTW, has TNE dealt with the Darrians and Sword Worlders?  Maybe the Regency
can hire Sword Worlds mercenaries for that fateful encounter with the
Coalition some day?

Well, okay, except that we\'ve already established that the RCES gets to make
its own determinations about who\'s `dead\', `despotic\', or `derelict\'.
Certainly, if the US can be threatened by Grenada, then the potential exists
for *significant* abuses of the RCES `principles\'.

Well, yes, but then it would be difficult to make the case that the RCES are
`good guys\'.  Wouldn\'t they just not be any worse `bad guys\' than anyone
else then? 

> So why is the RC any different?

Indeed!  Isn\'t this the question I asked several weeks ago when I asked what
TNE had to offer over CT/MT?  :-)

Well, great, but as real folks aren\'t we able to make some sort of judgement
about the validity of this claim?

My sense is we\'ve pretty much beat the Coalition to death at this point now
as well.  (Don\'t let that stop you if you\'ve still got a point.)  Maybe it
would be good to move on to Rodge\'s suggestion of a Regency discussion?  I
know some of you have expressed a preference for the Regency over the Coalition.
Tell us why.  And tell us what challenges you see the Regency facing.

What about all those Pocket Empires?  Someone has suggested that the Coalition
is just another Pocket Empire with some Hiver technical assistance.  If this
is the case then all(?) those Pocket Empires might provide as much potential
as the Coalition has.  Who\'s adventuring in Pocket Empires?

And we\'ve yet to hear much about non-TNE Imperium campaigns or from completely
non-Imperium Traveller campaigns.  Mayday, mayday, calling all backgrounds.

No you didn\'t Date me, She was one of the first Characters I ever rooled up
from those three little books... As to her being a countess the GM at the 
time said lets find out where she is countess of so I rolled to find the page
in that new! book The Spinward Marches and then the planet... The rest is
as they say history. So when Norris was written up we looked at the structer 
of the nobility and it became obvious as DGP pointed out Counts have 
( Usually ) three worlds they administer dukes have a subsector. Norris 
then was the Sector duke... Of course they knew eachother and at least in my 
campain are close friends and he respects her advice.
In the campain during the 5th fronteer war she was put in the same 
"Hospital" as Norris for their "Health" They were busted out ( That is a long
story but her husband had something to do with it...) and Norris gave her  
Command of the second defense of Regina. It was at Norris\' request that she
and her husband where made duke adn duchess by Strephon shortly before his 
untimly death...Here is an adventure in alternat Imp. History suppose that 
there where some under cover Noble PSI\'s in that throne room and they  where
able to prevent the assassination! hummm interesting...
any way that is how I started my MT Campain which is on it\'s Third group
now The assassination had occured and the group is waiting for the luxury
liner that they had tickets for to leave the Capitol and when i tleft they 
found that there was a killer on board their job... find the assassion and the 
target. I must say I was happy they figured out the killer but blew it on the
target, They kept their cover, to this day 032/1122 They do not know that 
they were Couriors from the Emporer to Norris!
Now they are more background and patrons as they are busy with larger affairs
than the Group...
However I am working on their kids as Catie and I have mapped out soem of the 
future of the "Regancy" up to about 1130. The group that is playing now is 
in 1121 or 22 I\'m not shure ...
that is Marcus and Co.
They are presently on a weird covert mission close to the Consulate.
the Consulate knows but are not talking.
We will see who survives...

Dear Anthony:
 
Here are my responses to your comments posted on March 16th:

I say, moan and groan all you want.  The TML is an open forum.
It\'s not like there is a set limit on the amount of material it
can hold. Anyone who doesn\'t like what you have to say can skip
your messages and read the ones they like.  That\'s what I like
about the TML -- it\'s a real potpouri.  Sure, a pocket can be
nice to concentrate efforts, but general discussions about
Traveller is what TML was made for -- and what can be more
general than the very rules through which the game is played?
 
BTW, would someone please post some info about how to join the
gdw-beta list?

TNE has its good points and bad.  I like the campaign, though it
saddens me that CT and MT are no longer supported commercially
with new material (TTC and TML are notable exceptions).  Thank
goodness for TML!

Boy, they REALLY got to you didn\'t they?  Heck, I don\'t plan on
using TNE (the campaign) for years to come -- not until they
finish the rules, and generate enough background to work with.
I\'m quite interested in seeing what they come up with, so I am in
part financing that endeavor by purchasing their products as they
come out.  But I\'ve spent so much time and effort developing the
Spinward Marches, that it makes sense to me to make use of my
custom materials for that region, rather than start developing
another region (the Old Expanses) from scratch and fear that it
will conflict with GDW\'s ongoing developments for the same
region.

As a Spinward Marches ref, I don\'t see TNE as a drawback or a
setback.  If anything, it enhances Spinward Marches/Regency
campaigns, because the borders actually become frontiers.  And
since the Regency, the Zhodani Consolate, the Darrian
Confederation, and the Sword Worlds -- and in my campaign the
spinward "land grants" (Foreven, Far Frontiers, Vanguard Reaches,
The Beyond, etc.) -- will have survived for the most part intact,
civilization will have continued to advance there
(population-wise, culture-wise, and technology-wise), NOT
regressed.  Civilization will be just a bit smaller as a whole,
\'tis all.

Yes, I missed it too.  I think I better play that "most American
of games" and catch-up before I let my fingers go crazy at the
keyboard on this one.
 
Later,
Rodge.

   That was my impression as well from reading Survival Margin and the
   TNE book on the Regency.  It was primarily public opinion resulting
   from the Trin incident that holds the Regency behind its lines, at
   least officially.  There may be factions in the government that are
   in fact operating in virus space, but of course the public can never
   know about that.  I can see a lot of potential there for campaign
   ideas.

   A related issue is the economy of the Spinward States.  In Survival
   Margin, they say that "there are no limitless resources or 11,000
   worlds" and in the TNE book "The Regency\'s economy has become
   overheated, and without access to new markets and new sources of
   raw materials, say the economists, it is bound to falter".  

   In 1196, the Regency held the referrendum about expanding into the
   wilds, which the public overwhelmingly rejected.

   I suspect that the current statements of economists may also be a
   manipulation of public opinion by factions within the
   government/academia/intelligentsia to convince the general public to
   accept the idea that expansion in _inevitable_ or that stagnation and
   decline will be the result.  That is, afterall, the same tatic used
   by our own governments to try and manipulate opinion regarding NAFTA,
   GATT, etc, even when the assertions are often suspect.  If you can
   get "in" economists with sufficient access to the media saying
   something long enough, it can become an accepted "fact" in
   time.

The Vampire highway? Vampire Imperial Highway? Ahh.. the Vampire
Information Highway!  They are computer life forms, afterall.
GDW combines the information hypeway and the vampire craze :-)

Does this highway pass through "alternate pocket empire setting" in the
TNE book? Kaggushus is pretty close to the Black Curtain.

               ----
 
Come on guys, lets DEVELOP the background rather than just
discuss it!
 
There is a definite gaping hole in TNE\'s background material --
the REGENCY and surrounds --  which leaves us SPINWARD MARCHERS
in the lurch.  This isn\'t a complaint, but merely an observation.
My opinion is, you can either FEEL BAD about this, or you can DO
SOMETHING about it!  And since GDW isn\'t working on the area, and
since they don\'t show anything on their release schedule for it
for at least the next year, that leaves the area wide open for US
to develop.  I\'ve seen several complaints on the TML about the
Regency not being supported, and my response to all of them is
DON\'T JUST SIT THERE, JOIN EFFORTS, HAVE FUN, AND WEAVE ITS
FUTURE!  I\'m sure we could come up with something truly
excellent.
 
So in the spirit of fantastic science fiction, I\'ll attempt to
get the ball rolling.  Here goes...
 
                  ----
                  Breaking the TL15 Barrier
                  ----
 
Thinking ahead to the New Era in the still-civilized regions,
did you ever wonder how the Regency managed to remain virus-free?
Well, they didn\'t do it by merely patrolling their borders, I can
assure you of that!
 
Here are the worlds from the Regency and its neighbors in the
Spinward Marches that are destined to break the Tech-level 15
barrier in my campaign, and the role of each of them in the war
against the Virus:
 
 
In my campaign, the following worlds are at the forefront of
technology in the New Era:
 
    In the Spinward Marches:
 
        GLISTEN -- A major robotics center, where environmental
        mining suits and battledress have evolved into
        sophisticated unmanned robots.  Most emergency service
        personnel (paramedics, firemen, search and rescue, swat
        teams, etc.) are bots, as are most of the workers in the
        housekeeping, maintenance, and mining industries\' labor
        forces.  When the Virus first struck, all robotics
        interfacing had to be reduced to direct sophont-given and
        coded commands, which put a major damper on industry in
        Glisten.  Work began immediately to develop a form of
        telecommunications that was safe from viral intrusion,
        and this research and development has continued to this
        day -- the resulting comm-filter technology is nearly
        full-proof and such filters are installed in all bots,
        ships, and communications equipment manufactured in
        Glisten.  As an additional security measure, all such
        equipment undergoes regular routine anti-viral
        diagnostics.
 
        The shipyards of Glisten have developed a sophisticated
        anti-virus defense system that is itself autonomous, and
        is a major export:  Unmanned drone SDB\'s, each outfitted
        with "canary" virus traps, are designed to patrol systems
        on the lookout for virus-infested ships.  The "canaries"
        are isolated computer chips that are allowed to become
        infected (only one is active at a time) in direct open
        communication with another ship.  Sophisticated
        diagnostic methods are used to monitor the canary\'s
        health, thus providing a way to detect virus-infected
        ships.  Advanced scanners, polygraph equipment, and
        automated boarding inspectors are also used to screen
        ships, whether manned or not.  These ships are the
        closest things to "white blood cells" in space, and
        combined with Glisten\'s comm-filter technology makes that
        place one of the safest from the Virus.
 
 
 
        MORA --  Is home to the largest sim-space data
        environment in existence.  When it was invaded by the
        Virus, many cyberspacers of the system encountered the
        viral aliens mono a mono.  At the height of the crisis,
        several dozen citizens became possessed by viral control
        through the net\'s direct neural interface, and ran amuck.
        Many deckheads were killed before they were able to rally
        together and successfully wipe the electronic symbiotic
        intruders out.  Several viral strains were captured in
        the net by cybertroopers, and a careful study of the
        quickly evolving species has proceeded since then.  The
        computers of Mora are patrolled by cybernetic police who
        jack directly into the system, and all cyberspacers can
        be called upon as militia if the need ever arises.
 
 
 
        RHYLANOR -- The pseudoreality capital.  Anthropomorphic
        robots have long been a part of the culture of this
        thriving world.  By the time of the Virus, Rhylanor had
        progressed into early AI, and the development of
        life-like androids and hologrammatic projections.  Home
        of the first android citizen, AB-101, "who" was actually
        knighted by Emporer Strephon himself and made sentient by
        Hiver manipulators at the computer concord at Shudusham.
        "Abee Wan Owen" did much to alleviate the public\'s
        initial apprehension toward life-like androids and
        holograms, and their numbers grew rapidly.
 
        However, when the Virus devastated Trin, robotophobia
        became the norm, and all androids were ordered to be
        powered down.  The effort went further, and one sentient
        android in particular was dismantled (killed).  Other
        androids protested in court, making a martr of their
        fellow, and were interned instead and required to wear a
        prominent "A" on their foreheads to distinguish them from
        true biologicals.  Quarantined before the Virus reached
        the planet, the android population was thus spared.  In
        their confinement, the androids of Rhylanor became the
        developers and keepers of the world\'s prominent computer
        systems, and developed their own subculture.  The
        "pseudos" undertook the mission to produce a vaccine that
        would protect them from the Virus.  After decades of
        unsuccessful attempts to isolate a genotype of the Virus
        due to its rapid adaptability, the androids eventually
        turned their efforts toward redesigning themselves to be
        virus-immune. The quarantine on androids was lifted some
        time ago, but most of the world\'s androids prefer their
        own company and infrequently venture from their communes,
        though biologicals frequently visit them!
 
        The holoprojected people of the world weren\'t so lucky.
        Arnold J. Rimmer holograms were a hot item on Rhylanor
        for awhile, until most of them became infected by a
        strain of the Virus dubbed the "Napoleon Complex",
        and tried to take over the world.  No one likes Arnold
        Judas Rimmer anymore, though there are still a few
        (uninfected ones) left, complaining about their
        unfortunate circumstances, and envying their android
        counterparts who have actual physical forms and who got
        all the lucky breaks.
 
 
 
        PALLIQUE -- Thrust into prominence by the fall of Trin,
        this mineral world was forced to fill the economic gap
        caused by that disaster.  Pallique has traditionally had
        an amber zone rating, due to its extreme distance from
        its sun, resulting in the world\'s critically low
        temperatures.  This environmental factor, compounded by
        the world\'s very thin atmosphere and scarcity of water
        (it was all frozen), cost the inhabitants over 1/2 of
        their world\'s rather high GWP (gross world product) just
        to control the environmental conditions within their
        habitats.
 
        This situation eventually led to the development of
        extremely light but well-insulated vacc-suits, which were
        much more cost-effective to heat and pressurize than
        entire habitats, yet not so cumbersome as to restrict
        movement and comfort.  So each individual became isolated
        in his or her own tiny habitat most of the time.  For
        daily hygiene and intimacy, one could retreat to the
        fresher which could be heated and pressurized once you
        entered, so you could desuit.
 
        This was the state of affairs on Pallique when the Virus
        came to be.  It was here that it was discovered that the
        Virus does not thrive well in very low temperatures.  As
        Pallique\'s computers were designed to operate in the
        extreme cold, this planet was barely troubled by the
        virus at all.  This allowed the planet to progress
        without devoting much of its resources to combating the
        virus, concentrating instead upon shifting from mining to
        the manufacturing of goods for export, including vacc
        suits, efficient heating and lighting systems, air and
        water recycling units, and air compressors and filtration
        systems.
 
 
 
        DARRIAN -- The Maghiz cataclysm shocked the Darrian race
        out of their hyper technological ambition, and the Virus
        shocked them back into it when it caused one of their
        great floating cities to come crashing down from the sky.
        In this age of monumental dangers, the lack of ambition
        to them equates to negligence.  Their response to the
        Virus was to declare war upon it, and bring all their
        resources to bear upon developing offenses and defenses
        against it.  They adapted immunity to electronic viral
        infection by progressing beyond silicon-based computer
        technology to fiber-optic and direct energy transmission
        (DET) computing systems.  To protect themselves from
        physical assault, they learned to duplicate the
        technologies of their distant past.  Vampire ships are
        vaporized with disintegration weapons, now standard
        armament on all Darrian military spacecraft.  [And no,
        their military technology is NOT for export].
 
 
 
        CHRONOR -- Ironically, with the coming of the Quarantine
        came increased rather than decreased trade with the
        Imperium, or at least with what was left of it.
        Chronor\'s major export:  Psionicists, psionics
        knowhow, and advanced robotics.  Its major import:  Hi
        tech cargos and data packages.
 
        The industry in the Consolate to get the biggest boost
        from this trade was, again ironically, communications.
        The Zhodani, masters of communicating via the direct
        transfer of thoughts, were decidedly behind in the area
        of mass communications systems and computer interfacing
        technologies.
 
        The most significant development of this technological
        influx was the meshing of psionics and DNI (direct
        neural interfacing).  The Zhodani, already adept at the
        formation of mental constructs for telepathic transfer,
        and in the methods of training this special skill, now
        had the technology to transfer thoughts directly into
        computers.  They took to it like fish to water.
 
        Pseudo-telepathy became the rage, and surpassed all other
        industries.  The masses, who longed for the abilities
        heretofore reserved for a privileged or gifted few, were
        exposed to a technology that would let them communicate
        mentally amongst each other.  Universities scrambled to
        reorganize their medical schools for the training of
        neuro-cybernetic surgeons, and several bio-cybernetic
        companies exploded into mega-corporations, the demand
        was so great.
 
        The Virus was no match for the Zhodani.  They quickly
        learned to sense it supernaturally, and once they
        learned its basic nature, destroying it was relatively
        easy.  It was made of minute particles of sand!  Zhodani
        telekenticists had no trouble obliterating it.
        Unfortunately, this also resulted in the destruction of
        the infected hardware as well.  But it was a small price
        to pay.
 
        As DNI technology expanded, hooked-in telepaths could
        easily pinpoint viral invaders and telekineticists
        equipped with detailed biofeedback aquired microscopic
        control over their mental skills, and eventually learned
        how to excise the virus directly and to repair the damage
        done by it.
 
I haven\'t gotten around to Deneb, Reft Sector, or the Trojan
Reaches yet, but noticed several high-tech worlds in the sector
data, including a couple TL16 worlds.  Since the stats were dated
1120, those worlds are bound to be even further advanced by the
turn of the century!
 
As for the Spinward Marches, what material have YOU developed for
it, whether CT, MT, or TNE?
 
Come on, post it here so everyone can benefit by it.  Help make
this repository of Traveller material GROW!

Jeff makes some very good points.  Clearly, those who are writing the
`history blurbs\' are trying to `rehabilitate\' the Star Vikings and while
this suggests they weren\'t `victorious\' this doesn\'t necessarily have to
be the case.  The Regency and the Coalition might have come to some sort
of integrative accord and yet the Star Vikings might still have been
perceived as `barbarians\' by the `dominant\' culture of the Regency.  (A
good example would be the `dominant\' American perception of Southerners.)
Another case might be that the Star Vikings are being `rehabilitated\' in
reaction to the `politically correct\' attitudes that originally painted
them as `bad guys\'.  (Sort of like the `men\'s movement\' now.)

And with *Traveller: The Fourth Imperium* we\'ll have all the TNE folks
complaining about all their TNE material being made obsolete and pining
away for the `good old days\' when Vikings were Vikings and the Virus was
`in your crosshairs\'.  :-)

Thanks for the info.  This particular fact makes me much less comfortable
with the Coalition.  It sounds a great deal like the Coalition may merely
be the pawn of the Hivers.  Is this the case?  Maybe all that `democracy\'
doesn\'t really matter?  (Watch out!  Here\'s comes the firestorm.)

Well, yes, but is it really relevant to say that some low-tech, backwater
world was `part\' of the Imperium.  Such a world played little or no role in
the conduct of Imperial affairs.  It was the worlds with an `affinity\' for
technology that `made up\' the Imperium and it will be worlds with similar
affinities that will make up whatever interstellar state or states that
arise from the Collapse.  I guess the worlds without these affinities are
what you would refer to as `ghettoized\'?

Loren on the GDW/TSR deal:
Unwanted speculation on GDW\'s future apart, I\'m in agreement with those 
people who believe that the death of DJ is generally a good thing for 
Traveller (or rather, what Traveller has become ...). One point I\'m not 
clear on, does this mean the unlamented demise of \'Journeys\' and the 
movement of Challenge back to a monthly schedule?

Cynthia and Dave on the outbreak of democracy in the RCES:
(shouting: let me through, I have a politics degree!)
Well, to start off with, modern democracy really starts with John Locke 
and the 17th Century; Locke\'s descriptions of the relationship between 
the individual and government led to the liberal philosophers of the 
enlightenment, such as Paine and Rousseau. Classical models influenced 
it, but not as much as Christianity and mediaeval tradition.

Anyhow, that departure apart (and thanks to everyone for letting the 
social scientists have a chance to take over the role of pointless 
discussion on this list from the hard sciences); why no aristocracy in 
the RCES? The easy answer is that there\'s none in Twilight:2000 either, 
so given that this is the same game ...

On the other hand, if you look at the UK as an example, we have an 
aristocracy, at least to a certain extent. Now, I think very few people 
would have that now if we were to design it from scratch; but for 
various complex reasons we\'re stuck with it (at least until the Labour 
party gets in for a couple of terms or so). The RCES people *are* 
rebuilding from scratch, pretty much, so they have that option. And I\'m 
sure that the hivers would have discouraged the development of a new 
aristocratic tradition, given that much of the blame for the Collapse 
(or at least its nature) could be associated with the constitutional 
arrangements of the Third Imperium.

By the way, I get the impression that most of the Imperial nobility was 
not of long standing. Extrapolating from the tradition of both refs and 
scenario writers of knighting adventurers after (or in the case of DGP 
midway through) a long campaign, most of the lower nobility (ie the 
mass of it) was probably created in the last couple of generations, and 
probably wasn\'t strong enough to counter any determined movement to 
overthrow it. 

Jeff Freeman on the future of TNE:
Best place that I can see for post TNE speculation is the introduction 
to Survival Margin. By NE65 we have "former black sphere" and "former 
Domain of Deneb" (though this latter may only be a reference to 
pre-Collapse arrangements). The inference I make from the passage is 
that by 65 the area of the former Imperium is, in one form or another, 
reunited (or rather, it is sufficiently peaceful that individuals can 
travel across its span). The Star Vikings are long gone. Kuniholm, 
writing in 1235 (NE35) speaks of them in the past tense. In general, it 
would appear that the Regency survives (doesn\'t it still have TL15? 
maybe I missed something), perhaps as part of a new Imperium (sans 
nobility). Whether this means the return of the D6 and a decent 
character generation system is another matter (he says bitterly).

Jeff Zeitlin on the K\'kree:
Yes, the K\'kree were caught in the Collapse with no way out. But why 
shouldn\'t the Hivers help the K\'kree as well? The K\'kree, unlike 
humaniti, weren\'t responsible for the collapse of hiver civilisation. 
If the hivers intervene, they can establish a more pliable, less 
extreme K\'kree civilisation to coreward. 

Roger Sanger on a Regency list:
Hi Rodge. I\'d much prefer if all traffic was kept to TML. The schism of 
TML was a Bad Thing from which the list is only just beginning to 
recover (I can tell this by the fact that my Windows based newsreader 
has recently started to complain again that the messages are too big). 
By the way, it would be nice if someone started reposting digests of 
the Genie discussions to TML (Do GDW realise that Genie does not have 
points of access in the UK? And for that matter, do they care?)

Finally, anyone spotted Path of Tears in the UK? Challenge 72?

The only problem I have with this ruling is that if I decide to have a
minimum bridge crew of 2 then I will be unable to use any ships made by
someone who decided that the minimum should be 1. Many of the ships in the
encyclopedia have a bridge crew of 1 and many ships that I have downloaded
have bridge crews of 1. These facts pretty much force me to reduce the
minimum bridge crew. 

Originally, before I had the Encyclopedia, I rationalized that the minimum
bridge crew should be 2 because the station had to be maned 24 hours per
day, much like a modern jet or ship. It assumes that someone should be awake 
and on the bridge at all times, incase there is an emergency of some sort. I 
like this concept and want to keep it but again I run into the problem
stated above. It would mean that I have to redesign several of the ships in
the Encyclopedia and that I couldn\'t use many of the ships I have downloaded 
(unless I redesign those as well). 

Since the average travel time from planet to 100 diameters is 85 hours
(assumes 1G acceleration and a 13000 km diameter world), making the minimum
bridge crew 1 must mean that the ship can fly itself for the most part. So
what happens if something unexpected comes up while the pilot is asleep? 

I would like to know the thoughts of other MegaTraveller Referees about
this. How did you resolve this problem?

Story: Duke Admiral Milidran Pike is one of the most celebrated 
and well-known members of the Imperial Navy. His career has 
been long and strenous, but has at last produced the epitome of 
an Imperial Naval Officer.
	Pike graduated the Naval Academy with honors and went 
to Flight School. His first assignment was Shore Duty, and he 
applied to several schools out of boredom. He went to 
Intelligence School, where he was taught how to weed out unfit 
personnel from the Navy, and was subsequently assigned to a 
Core patrol unit. Boredom set in again, and Pike went to 
Command College, where he almost failed.
	After Command College, Pike was assigned to a Strike 
Squadron. Pike, as a newcomer, was given mop-up (boring) 
duty and requested Staff College, hoping to make the 
connections to transfer to Line Duty. After Staff College, he 
spent one year with a lakadaisical patrol of reject pilots. He 
transferred to another unit, in which he received his first MCUF 
for singlehandedly destroying three Aslan fighters after his own 
ship was rendered defenseless.
	Pike then became a recruiter. The next year, he returned 
to his patrol unit, and was promoted for destroying the brifge of 
a pirate ship after the attack was abandoned. He ejected out of 
his own critically damaged ship after setting it on a collision 
course, and floated eight hours in the cold depths of space 
before being rescued. He spent a year in retraining and was 
given command of a patrol.
	Pike commanded the patrol for two more years, in the last 
of which he was decorated for making the patrol the best in the 
Navy. He was then assigned to Strike Duty against Zhodani 
bases, and commanded another patrol for a year. He accepted 
demotion from command in order to be a wingman again, and 
was subsequently awarded another MCUF for gallantry in 
action.
	Later tours included Training, a Frozen Watch, and Shore 
Duty-during which he was promoted to O4 for turning a dead-
end unit around. He spent two years in Strike Squads, secretly 
working for Naval Intelligence. A turning point in his career 
was as an aide to Admiral Larson, who got Pike his long-
awaited Line Duty. Pike comanded a communication ship in the 
battle of Vland IV, took part in a Strike Squadron, and again 
took command of a ship, the destroyer Vendez. He ended his 
career commanding a training station in the Spinward Marches, 
and was given the title of Duke over the planet Maitz in 
recognition of his long and loyal service. He holds an orbital 
residence over his domain.
	Duke Admiral Pike has recently left for points unknown in a 
Merchant vessel listed as the Mildoru. His majesty did not say why, 
although it has been noted that he desired "another go" at the 
spacer\'s life.

but the struggle between the Federalists and the Centrists, if not settled,
could lead to instability. The Centrists, led by the planet Oriflamme, seems to
be the faction most interested in forcing everyone in the RC to conform to a
standard, theirs being a strong central government built along the Feudal
Technocracy model. The Federalists, currently the "dominant" group and led by
RC headquarters world Aubaine, seem to opt for a more open approach, truly
opposing only dictators who oppress their populace with advanced tech and rule
against the people\'s will. Things are not as organized as perhaps people might
like. Probably the RC will come to a "compromise" between the Federalists and
the Centrists, and wind up with a government somewhere in the middle.
   Someone mentioned the "historical" looks at the "Star Vikings" in the TNE
rulebook and Survival Margin, and took this to mean that they were a thing of
the past by that time. I would agree with this. The RC itself might abolish the
idea if 1.) They complete the major part of their mission and aren\'t needed
anymore, 2.) It becomes obvious that their intended schedule was impossible to
keep to, which I beleive it is. Just because the RC wants to recolonize three
sectors in four years doesn\'t mean that GDW will let them. What\'s that old
line about the "best laid plans of mice and men..." 3.) They run into the
Regency and the RC\'s expansion is halted. Assuming that there will be war of
at least a limited duration, the RC is frankly doomed. If cooler heads prevail,
they might come to some sort of accomodation. Some of this may depend on what
the Hivers decide to do. Either through an RC defeat, or simply running out of
room, there would come a point where the "Star Vikings" as portrayed would no
longer be needed.
   In any event, we need a Regency Sourcebook of the same level of quality as
the Path of Tears book to really be able to make predictions about what the
Regency will or won\'t do.
  By the way, an aside to GDW: a contest was run in Challenge to guess the
identity of the "woman in black" on the cover of the TNE rulebook. It may be
too late. and electronic submissions may not count, but I think it\'s Seldrian,
true daughter of Archduke/First Regent Norris! Or at least one of HER clones.

  My assumption is that the Bridge Crew requirements exist for one real
reason: determining how many seats to put on the bridge deckplan.
  What with reconfigurable control panels, semi-intelligent computers
(during the Imperial era, anyway), and the Han Solo "wall-banging"
method of repair, only one person is required to actually _run_ a
bridge most of the time: the pilot/astrogator.  So long as a person
who can pilot the ship (and knows which way to point it) is present,
you can get by.  He can wear headphones to monitor the Comm
station, and (in a really small ship) keep the several most important
engine telltales in view, thus monitoring Engineering.
  But safety and sanity dictate that there be an extra control station
installed on the bridge.  Why?  So someone else _can_ help if needed.
So your just-fried control station doesn\'t leave the ship without
controls.  So the padding on one chair doesn\'t wear out quite so fast.
Etcetera.
  How you (as a referee) keep your players running around in a
bridge too big for them is either to be ignored, subjected to player
ingenuity, or played for comic effect.  Standing watch on a civilian
ship requires only that the person on duty know who to wake up in
case of emergencies...

  The bridge crew question isn\'t a MegaTrav problem, BTW, it\'s an older
problem that was carried over without due consideration.  Anyone who
has looked at MT construction without benefit of High Guard and Striker
can tell you: there are NO EXPLANATIONS.  The Craft Construction rules
in MT are the poorest documented in Traveller history, and among the
ommissions is the older note regarding really small ships.
  Not to beat a dead horse, but TNE fixes this problem by rigorously
defining Bridge size in terms of crew stations.  The number of
stations you decide to keep manned is your problem ;)
 
  To summarize: Bridges have at least two stations (seats), but don\'t
always require two people to run them in the smaller ships.

Well here\'s my $0.02.

For my old campaings (...haven\'t had any new ones either:( )I tried to
model it as a mesh of seaport and airport.  However this is a moot
point if you\'re in the wilds...just be happy to find a "firm marked
spot".

Basic components should include: (bear w/me as I start w/the obvious)
1	Landing/TO pad with blast deflector.  In lower tech level these
would require water cooling, so expect to find the associated
plumbings.  Also for this consideration it would be wise to have
nearby a *large* body of water. At lease one long runway for airframe
vehicle L/TO operations. (I usually size these at 3000+ meters)
2	Covered hangers: four types, Commerical passenger loading
(nicely furnished, subtle but highly secured against hijacking),
Commerical cargo loading, expect to find secured but lightly
furnished, lots of loading equipments.  General private hanger for
privatly owned and operated vessals.  And finally the service hanger
where you get to fork over your annual maintance payments:)
3	Well paved taxi way connecting item 1 and 2.  Expect to find
available *heavy* duty tow truck (wheel/track/grav/legs) to move ships
around the starport.  (Facility maintance crew hates cleaning up HePlaR
burn marks...)
4	Firestation and emergency medical center
5	Fuel farm (may or maynot contain Purifyer system depending on
local condition) and a distribution network.  Really lowtech will use
fuel trucks, followed by above ground lines (easier to maintain and
inspect) and finally underground lines.  However truck will always be
used for special conditions (i.e. "You mean your TL15 vapor recovery
lines won\'t go into my salvaged TL10 fuel tank?")
5.5	Power Plant: If local politics and technology allows, this can
be a bank on back up generators.  Otherwise it can be anything from
steam turbine to fusion power plants.
6	Air/Near space traffic control center:  This can usually be
found in the orbital portion (or High Port).  For saftly reasons
there\'s probably a backup set dirtside.  Responsible for maintaining
communciation during initial approach.  Also expect to find a large
ground or space based logn range detection array.
7	Tower/Operation center:  Direct landing and takoff vector,
schedual landing/TO time, Taxi way right of way assignment ("gee
officer, I didn\'t mean to broadside the scout/courier. just heading
over to the freight hanger in my cherry red Fat Trader.")  Responsible
for communication during final approACH and TO.  TOC should exist in
both High Port and Dirt Side,  Short range high resolution sensor are
often installed to side L/TO operations.
8	Customs:  There should be three customs.  One for commerical
passenger like those in most major airports, One for freight with
contraband detection equipments (big ones for bulk cargo) and
enviromental controlled quartine area for bio freights.  And finally
the one run by the local planetary landlord...consult your local
government type and lawlevel for ideas...but only if you wanna leave
the starport area.
9	Passenger service:  Waiting rooms, overpriced cheezy
restaurants, Hotels/Shopping Mall/Casino/PostOffice/Hospital(wanna guess why?)
complexe for those staying on Starport grounds.  Also expect to find
Starport police to keep things undercontrol.  Other service also
available can be personnel service, freight broker, legal aides,
education centers, engineering consulting firms, banks, and your
firendly neighborhood Sears fusion gun sales/service center :)
10	Planetary Transportation Hub:  Located outside but adjacent to
Starport property lines.  Provide transportation service via
planes/trains/car/bus/grav/helio/ship/bikes/feet...(get the idea :). Since
this is base on my design theres also a unfillable, free parking
structure w/easy access to the starport.:)
11	High Port specifics:  For commerical passenger and delicate
freight service, direct docking to the central station is provided.
All others can be placed into unobstructing parking orbits.  Custom
agents board via custom cutters for paperwork and inspection.
Personnel and freight are off loaded using starport operated shuttles.
12	Sateillites facilities:  At class A and some B starports,
expect to find orbital construction facilities for large starships.
If not reasonable close to the main High Port facility ther should be
a small station nearby as office/rest area/toolshack.The simplest form can
be a open frame structure (i.e. dry dock from Star Trek movies) but in
some systems with radiation problems this would be completely enclosed
and armored.
13	Common to both High Port and Dirt Side are administrative
office for the Chief administrator, chief of sections, central
computer, vehicle pool, cafeteria, showers, and personel locker
spaces.  The major sections would include facility maintance,
personnel, security, legal, finance, emergency service, operations,
and diplomatic corp (if there\'s a greater government out there...)
Like the before mentioned power plant the starport may or maynot
contain its own communication network.
14	Scattered through out the commerical passenger section expect
to find large number of information/service booth (manned or
automated) where a traveller can get directions, rent vehicles, and to
get general local informations (i.e. local sign for \'men\'s room\').
Can also be found in fewer qty in the private hanger areas.

Okay so this was more like $0.03 worth.  Hope you find *some* of this
info useful :>

When the ship are in jump or in transit from A to B, and that that
travel takes kore than one shift, anyone can watch the controls. In
jumpspace, there isn\'t much to monitor except for the powerplant,
jumpdrive and the environment. In transit from jump point which may take
one or two shifts, there isn\'t much more to monitor. The chances of
hitting something out there that would seriously harm the ship is
virtualy nil. And most sensors are good enough to pick up something that
will. And thus the sensors and the controls can be rigged to alarm units
that will wake up the pilot.

Yes.  I got the idea from \'The Day the Universe

mentioned as a really major leap forward.  I\'ve started
a very simple key word index for the JoTAS Amber Zone

I have to put my cards on the table. I thought the Rebellion was an interesting
development in the game\'s background, and looked forward(?!) to watching the
struggle against the Long Night II unfold. I thought Virus was a \'soon to feel
outdated\' gimmick to wash the Imperial background away, a marketing ploy to
kick in a new TW2Kish twist to the \'jaded\' past. As it turns out, it looks as
if the Imperium (Regency) will make a comeback in the relatively near future.

My current campaign is set using the Flaming Eye scenario pack (Lishun, date
1120), using the TNE / Brilliant Lances rules. As for the HePlar Drive debate I
use the \'multiply the endurance by 10\' rule. It happens to give a nice feel,
and gives the Engineer something to do. In addition the HePlar looks much more
like good old MT Thrusters, and therefore can be used in city environments. Cop
out? Yes, but I\'m interested in the look of the thing.... Ok so I play Star
Wars RPG, I can give up any time. Honest . . .

By the by what happened to the poll on which rules/background we\'re all using?
Was it you Derek? If it\'s been posted apologies but although I\'m on the nightly
I don\'t seem to get them all.

In a nutshell I would have liked to have seen a development of a fragmented
Imperium with some Core / Frontier explorations. I take it that an alternative
history supporting this is out of the question? I think so.

There is little in PoT to make me change my mind. However, I think it\'s one of
the nicest sourcebooks ever put together by GDW. I particularly like the
internal politics between Federalists and Centrists. Most apposite for my
country\'s national politics at the moment! What accomodation can be found with
the Guild? What political structure can the Federalists come up with once (if?
- - can there be any doubt) the RC has established itself. The Imperium was
incredibly Federalist. Local politics was allowed to flourish; different
regions of space had distinct cultural identities (heightened and polarised in
the Rebellion); devolved decision making by regional nobles. Sensible Imperial
codes relating to Tax and Conflict were in place to ensure the greater good of
the whole. Democratic? No. Effective? Yes. Perhaps the RC could also learn from
Imperial history? What is the RIGHT sort of government structure in the
Traveller environment? How would it change if Longbow introduces new forms of
interstellar communication?

I am interested to see what lessons the Regency has learnt from the politics of
the past, as this will impact on the Imperium for the future. Any thoughts out
there?

If I do use PoT, I will be tempted to add 100 years to all post 1130 dates, TNE
1 = 1300.

P.S. I don\'t believe in assimilation. Just doesn\'t happen. Right, now that I\'ve

the Virus and drag out the Rebellion for 70 years, or for that matter throw
out the Rebellion and let the Third Imperium live on, go ahead! I was under the
impression that we were discussing the TNE background as written, due to some
desire on the part of those participating to understand it. I can see where you
are looking for inconsistencies in the TNE set-up. That\'s good, actually; I\'m
sure Frank and Dave would appreciate the help! Keeping fictional universes
consistent is never easy, especially when more than one person contributes.
And especially when that development is spread over 17 years and involves a
lot of open-ended stories resolved by thousands of people in 1000 different
ways!
   Before I abandon the RC for the developing Regency discussion, let me say
that I treat the RC as neutral leaning towards good. The PC\'s in my RCES
campaign want to be good guys; they\'ll shortly be running into some Lancers
with a very different view. The RC is currently under the leadership of the
Aubani, with a few concessions to the Oriflammens. such as the "official"
limitation of activities to the primary AO (which both sides violate rather
frequently). The Hivers DEFINITLEY have an ulterior motive, and when the
humans find out, it may cause some serious questioning of the RC\'s goals and
purpose. There is one Pocket Empire in Diaspora which may cause trouble for
the RC (the Covenant of Sufren), and two more developing. There\'s also a
60,000 ton Vampire ship with LOTS of vampire fighters and cyborged/Virus
infected Solomani troops on their way to the RC to cause my players SERIOUS
trouble.
   And now, on to the Regency. I agree with Roger; let\'s develop the area
ourselves! Sure, we may wind up with many different versions of the Regency,
but that\'s okay; all campaigns are different to some extent. You may even
decide that what we develop is better than the "official" stuff that comes out.
That\'s okay, too; as gamemasters, we have the right to draw from whatever
sources we choose. I will say one thing, though; I think we should say that
GDW is free to use whatever ideas they wish to from our Regency discussions
without hassle. After all, it is their game. If they use enough of our ideas,
obviously credit would be nice (and I\'m sure they would do this). I don\'t
want to see them do a Regency sourcebook somewhere down the line and have a
bunch of people complain "They stole ideas from us!" As far as I\'m concerned
they can have mine, if any are worthwhile enough to be used.

Wasn\'t Norris\' `hospitalization\' really a cover for his mission to retrieve
the Imperial Warrant from interdicted Algine that he used to replace Admiral
Santanocheev?  I\'m not taking issue with varying from the `official\' setting
but rather just wonder if someone can confirm this `memory\' of mine.


rodge@cyberspace.com (Roger Sanger) asks:
 
> WHAT IS IN A STARPORT?

Well, first you need to know what era (CT/MT or TNE) and what class.  Let\'s
assume you\'re looking for a CT/MT (or TNE in the Regency) class A or B.  It\'s
going to be similar to a modern cargo and passenger airport combined with an
aircraft manufacturing plant combined with a sea port and shipyard.  Besides
passenger and cargo dis/embarkation facilities there are going to be shipbuiding
facilities, maintenance facilities and a ship trials range.  There will be
customs facilites, security facilites, traffic control facilities and military
facilities if a base is present.  There will be `operations\' facilities much
like at any large place of employment: offices, cafeterias, day care, lounges,
employee parking (or mass transit stations), etc.

There will be passenger and cargo interface facilites: parking, mass transit 
stations, cargo vehicle (truck) docks, taxi and shuttle stands, etc.

The `startown\' region beyond the extrality fence will have passenger
accommodations, employee `stress relief\' establishments (bars, brothels, etc.),
commercial offices and warehouses, and housing for port employees.  Convention,
retail (the `mall\') or `theme park\' facilities may also exist here.

If the port has an orbital element some or all of these things may be located
there.

That should get you started.

The \'Net gremlins seem to be trying very hard to keep me from posting
this little piece of opinion about the Regency.  First, there was my
erroneous posting of Sunday (again, my humble apologies).  Then I tried
to complete that posting but the message never seemed to make the TML
nor did my copy to myself appear.  So here goes again.

Several folks have wondered why the Regency has not made more progress
beyond the Virus Quarantine and into the Wilds.  It has been noted that
public opinion in the Regency is largely against such expansion while
`economic pressures\' seem to call for it.  It has also been noted that
another obstacle to expansion might be concerns about possible threats
from the Zhodani or Vargr or Aslan *ihaeti* (or whatever they\'re called
in TNE).

My sense is that public opinion in the Regency will be whatever the
leadership wishes it to be.  Norris is (was?) nothing if not an excellent
`molder\' of public opinion.  Only the `Hero of the Fifth Frontier War\'
could overcome centuries of psi-phobia and anti-Zhodani sentiment.

The second issue is the `paper tiger\' of the Vargr threat.  This has not
been credible to me since the days of the Rebellion despite the efforts of
GDW.  It takes a stable government to effectively wage war.  The Vargr
are *predisposed* to fragmentation and factionalism.  Any good leader
would see that the Vargr threat could be neutralized by fostering instability
in the Extents.  Certainly such a task is not beyond the capabilities of
Norris and his heirs.  Corsairs may be tiresome but they do not pose a
real threat.

The Zhodani remain a mystery to me.  Maybe some of you with TNE rules have
an opinion on this?

And the *ihaeti* seemed to have stopped being a threat even before the
Virus appeared when the Denebians started viewing them as colonists rather
than invaders.

And it seems to have been established that the Virus no longer poses an
insurmountable threat despite the public opinion in the Regency.

So with all these `imaginary\' reasons dispelled, what might be the real
reason the Regency has not expanded into the Wilds?

IMHO, the *primary* threat to the Regency is that posed by an opponent that
might question its `legitimacy\' as the `heir\' to the Third Imperium.  As far
as the Regency knows, one or more of the Rebellion Factions might also have
managed to `survive\' the onslaught of the Virus and the subsequent Collapse.
Many of these states might challenge the Regency\'s claim to the mantle of
the Old Imperium.  Imagine the response in the Regency (and elsewhere) 
should a `just and noble\' granddaughter of Lucan (or Margaret) emerge from
behind the Black Curtain at the head of a `Renaissance Fleet\' anxious to
bring `all of Strephon\'s children\' back into the Imperial `family\'.

Therefore, it is in the interest of the Regency leadership to remain in
Quarantine.  The longer the Regency populace is isolated the lesser the
chance that *any* claimant to the Imperial heritage, no matter how legitimate
they may seem, will be able to garner their support for abandonment of the
`regency\' and a return to the `Imperial\' fold.

(dare I admit it?) I was very tempted to cough up the $43 for the two of

Well, yes, but even the `newest\' regions of the Imperium had been incorporated
for more than a century which means any New Era xeno- or techno-phobia has
only had a similar amount of time to develop at best.  I know the rulebook
might say xeno- and techno-phobia are rampant in places but that doesn\'t
mean it makes *sense*.  Remember, a *lot* of TNE grandparents are going to
remember a *lot* of `good\' things about technology and off-worlders.

This is not my sense of the Third Imperium at all.  I always felt that any
grunt soldier from the Old Expanses would have felt just as at home in 
a unit in Trojan Reach and a Deneb free trader just as comfortable in the
Solomani Rim.  Sure, there was a great variety from planet to planet but
most of Imperial culture (which was the *only* interstellar culture) ended
at the starport extrality except on those high pop and tech worlds that
were the `backbone\' of the Imperium.  Maybe the Imperium was also `ghetto-
ized\'?

Thus, TNE `interstellar\' culture (Coalition or anyplace else) will have
its roots in Imperial culture.  In effect, most of those `varied\' cultures
beyond the extrality fence `gave-up\' on the stars *long* before the 
Rebellion even.  Sure, *some* of these will venture to the stars in TNE but
*most* TNE interstellar culture will have an Imperial (and technological)
heritage.

Yes, but none of these were *interstellar* cultures.

This Vargr threat has always seemed a `paper tiger\' to me since the days of
the Rebellion.  As long as the Vargr remain(ed) fragmented and factionalized
they pose(d) no real threat to the Regency(Domain).  Sure corsairs are 
troublesome but it takes a centralized state to wage war.  If I were Regent
(or had been Archduke) I would have worked constantly to keep the Vargr frag-
mented and unstable.  This doesn\'t seem to be too difficult a task since the
Vargr are prone to factionalism.  (The US has been doing this quite effectively
in Latin America since the days of the Monroe Doctrine and for much the same
reasons - an unstable neighbor is not much of a threat.)

Yes, but, in both these examples the `unconventional\' agents had *interests*
that propelled them in the `unexpected\' directions.  These examples don\'t
counter the point that there is no apparent reason why the Regency *shouldn\'t*
be expanding into the Wilds.  Yes, the public might be afraid of the Virus
(but they used to be afraid of the Zhodani too - remember the psi helmet
craze? - but that\'s changing) and the Vargr `threat\' isn\'t as large as GDW
seems to be intent on painting it.  One reason *might* be that the Regency
fears encountering another power that may have survived the Virus and has
a similarly `legitimate\' claim to the Old Imperium.  Any number of the 
Rebellion Factions might have survived the Virus (as far as the Regency knows)
and might therefore challenge the legitimacy of the `Regency\'.  The longer
the Regency remains isolated the less likely the populace is going to throw
out the Regent when the `True, Legitimate Heir\' to Strephon shows up -
reardless of how legitimate that `heir\' might seem.  This threat to its
legitimacy seems to me to be the *greatest* threat faced by the Regency.
If a `decent, noble\' daughter of Lucan were to emerge from behind the Black
Curtain at the head of a `Renaissance Fleet\' it would pose a much greater
threat to the Regency leadership than any Viral or Vargr adversary.  Fearing
just this sort of event the Regency leadership may very well be *encouraging*
these fears of the Virus and the Vargr (and Zhodani, and *ihaeti* . . . .)

Well, this is a chance to really spark some flames but let me respond in
this fashion.  The US wasn\'t `beaten\' by the North Vietnamese (there are
no Viet Cong military governors in San Francisco).  What happened was that
the North Vietnamese were able to convince the US that its goals - namely
the survival of its client state in the South - were not worth the cost of
maintaining it - either in terms continued American casualties or through
escalation to nuclear weapons, neither of which would have been supported
at home.

The Gulid might use similar tactics to counter the Coalition *or* the Regency
in the *Guild\'s* area of operations but the Guild could never use such tactics
*offensively*.

Again some really good stuff - especially the continued expansion to the
Regency.  Once more I apologize for my erroneous post of the first part of
this piece.

Dear me, I take the Easter weekend off, and come back to 250K ish of TML stuff!
Drain of departmental resources....nah!

Um, I don\'t know if y\'all in America are interested, but I\'ve just been
back to Mummy and Daddy\'s house out in the sticks and dug out some
Traveller stuff from back issues of White Dwarf, at the behest of my
fellow TMLer Roger Sanger. Unfortunately, I left the disk with the

Don\'t get excited, there isn\'t much.

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone could send me information regarding TNE charts 
and forms on Excel for Fire, Fusion, and Steel (where I can FTP to get 
them, etc...).

Also, Brilliant Lances mentions that RAFM makes miniatures for TNE 
starships. Do they also make miniatures for grav tanks and troops and if 
so, could someone send me the mailing address for RAFM or any other 
miniature dealer (I\'m looking at both 15mm and 25mm).

Now for some technical things: 

1)How do Black and White Globes work? What are the HPG banks and how do 
they accumulate damage and dissipate the damage?

2)Can ships smaller than 100 tonnes be jump capable?

3)Has anyone attempted to make \'wet navy\' ships using the ship creation 
rules and if so, where can I get some tips and sample designs?

Thanks for everyone\'s patience and assistance.

This is a trivial exercise, when armed with the necessary two equations:

  1) circumference = pi * diameter
       - or -
     circumference = pi * radius * 2

and...

  2) surface area = pi * radius^2

Since you already know the circumference (c), we can calculate the
radius (r) as:

  r = c / (2 * pi)

Thus, the surface area (s) is:

  s = pi * (c / (2 * pi))^2

BTW, is doesn\'t matter what unit of measurement you work in (kilometers,
miles, or cubits), since the math is abstract. Whatever unit you start
with is the unit you\'ll get the results in.

Now what *I* want to know is how to calculate liberated energy from
a nominally non-elastic collision.  The Shoemaker-Levin (sic) comet
is going to hit Jupiter in July, and I\'d like to know how many ergs
will be released when several 4-kilometer in diameter chunks of ice
slam into a nice, thick hydrogen laden atmosphere at 60 km/sec.

To Mark Cook:

Simplifying hugely (and not taking fusion/fission reaction into A/C), you can
calculate the K.E. from such an impact, using 1/2 m (v*v).

The mass of a 4 km diameter chunk of ice is:

density of ice (in kg/m^3) * (4/3 * pi * (diam./2)^3) (in m^3)

which is roughly 0.8 * 4 * 2000^3 = 2.7 * 10^10 kg

Multiply half this by the square of the speed (in m/s)..

1.35 * 10^10 * 3.6 * 10^9 = 4.9..no, call it 5 * 10^19.

As we have used SI units (metres, kg, seconds) all the way through,
 this figure for energy will be in Joules. You lot can convert it 
into Ergs, BTU or hamster.seconds, if you want.

Does this figure seem a bit high?

Not for celestial pyrotechnics.

BTW, why won`t this start a fusion reaction? Because, all this energy 
will be liberated in the (relatively) cool and low-pressure external
 shells of the planet. The core that is actually hot and heavy enough
to go bang will never feel the effect of the impact.

Hi all.

First, for Mark -- I don\'t know how much it will be, but I\'d
call the collision partial elastic, rather than partially
inelastic.  Not that it maters much.  Shame we\'ll lose a comet.
Did see a thing a few days ago about how it\'s actually going to
hit fairly close to the earthside limb of Jove, so we should
get a risg-side seat for Hubble.

===
Next -- Starports.  Don\'t get me started.  Nothing (IMHO) in 
all of the T/MT/TNE domain is more in need of development work.
Just been talking with James about some of my ideas, in fact.
I think I want to do a *complete* set of navigational and approach
charts -- but only for ONE world.  I offer this to the list.  
Please tell me which world you want.  So far I\'m seriously 
considering doing hold zones, approach plates, frequencies, 
services available, locations, times of operation, contact 
methods and persons, landing and parking fees, fuels type and
availability, local attractions, etc for:

  jump points
  high ports
  low ports
  air ports
  asteroid clusters and claims
  refueling queues

and perhaps some others.  What I haven\'t figured out yet, is if
I want to do this for on-screen delivery or on-paper delivery.
Please let me know.

====
Finally -- CAT
My labor of love -- computer assised RPG\'s.

I find myself unable to spend enough time online and connected to 
keep the list talking.  If anyone would like to take over as moderator/ 
instigator on the CAT list, please drop me a line.  Write to 
rdj@plaza.ds.adp.com so I\'ll see it sooner.  It\'s not that I want
to give it up or fold the list, but I\'m just too busy with real
life to give it any cycles at all.  That\'s not fair to you.

>2)Can ships smaller than 100 tonnes be jump capable?

In the original "black box" 1977 Traveller rules, no.  However, I\'ve
done a careful reading of FFS, and *I can\'t find any reason why it\'s
not possible*.  The only restriction I could find on ship jump size
had to do with the minimum required size of the jump drive (I think
only two cubic meters!) and of course the supporting controls, fuel,
and so forth!  This also had the odd side effect that such "mini-ships"
with j6 drives could be _smaller_ that ones with lower tech j1 drives,
because of the way required jump drive size per hull size is calculated,
as I recall.

Furthermore, ships with acceleration greater than 6 G are also now
possible.  As I read the rules, G-tanks can be combined with grav
compensators to counteract the effects of acceleration on crew.
You can even exceed those limits on acceleration if you are willing
to suffer skill penaties on the performance of your organic crew.
I have a design for a 50 ton heavy fighter very similar to the one
in _Book 9: Fighting Ships_ that is essentially a TL16 interceptor
with a crew of two, small stateroom, and 12 G acceleration.  Pilots
with neural jacks are recommended!  Cost was about MCr 50 for the
stripped-down prototype model.  Note that this craft is of course
very heavily armored, in line with the design rules for high-
acceleration ships.  It has about the same number of G-turns as
the Rampart standard 9 ton fighter design.  I am willing to post
design sheets for the monster.  10 G would be reasonable in a TL15
interceptor, I believe.  Virus with one of these things would be
BAD NEWS.

Cynthia:

    Well... (1) Ask the people living near the border (or well within 
it) how they feel about continual hit-and-run guerilla-style raids. 
You know, cruise in, lob a few bombs to temporarily disable local 
defenses (lob nukes if the defenses are tough), land troops at the 
target, grab whatever you came for, blowing away anything (or 
anyone) that gets in your way, leave after throwing some more missiles
at defense ships to delay pursuit.  If this happens just once a year, 
your world is going to look like Lebanon and your people will have a 
siege mentality -- if it happens every few months, it\'s going to look 
like Sarajevo.  And don\'t even bother having an economy.  This is a 
bit more than "tiresome".
    Fighting Vargr corsairs is like nailing jello to a wall, or 
finding Vietcong in the woods.  Yes, they can\'t take on your fleets, 
but they can cripple your civilian society and are very hard to pin 
down.
    (2) Vargr nations are "fragmentary" by the standards of the 3rd 
Imperium.  Compared to modern Earth nations, or the Darrians or the 
Sword Worlders, some of those Vargr nations are huge.  In Gvurrdon, 
there is at least one multi-subsector TL-15 (!!) nation (The Rukh 
Aeguezz).  They could do some damage if they went "on the warpath", 
much more so than the pathetic Sword Worlds fleets (TL 11-12) and the 
two TL9-10 Vargr worlds that joined in the "Outworld Coalition" during
the FFW.
    (3) How do you "foster instability in the Extents"?  Vargr have 
been living and developing societies to cope with their factional 
nature for 40,000 YEARS!  What can you possibly do to them that they 
haven\'t already done to themselves at one time or another, and learned
to cope with?  And what nation(s) do you start with?

more from David:

    This is not my sense of the Third Imperium at all.  I always felt 
that any grunt soldier from the Old Expanses would have felt just as 
at home in a unit in Trojan Reach and a Deneb free trader just as 
comfortable in the Solomani Rim.  Sure, there was a great variety from 
planet to planet but most of Imperial culture (which was the *only* 
interstellar culture) ended at the starport extrality except on those 
high pop and tech worlds that were the `backbone\' of the Imperium.  
Maybe the Imperium was also `ghetto- ized\'?  
    Thus, TNE `interstellar\' culture (Coalition or anyplace else) will
have its roots in Imperial culture.  In effect, most of those `varied\'
cultures beyond the extrality fence `gave-up\' on the stars *long* 
before the Rebellion even.  Sure, *some* of these will venture to the
stars in TNE but *most* TNE interstellar culture will have an Imperial 
(and technological) heritage.  

Cynthia:

    This coincides with my view of the Imperium...pre-Virus.  I have 
always envisioned 3I as having a unified "Spacer" culture composed of 
the nobility, the interstellar merchants, and the Imperial military 
(including the Scouts).  "Beyond the extrality fence", most 
significant worlds had their own, local culture, and most people who 
lived on those worlds could care less about what went on beyond their 
own sky (so long as it didn\'t affect them in obvious ways), and knew 
about as much about "Spacer" (Imperial) culture as the average Joe 
knows about the military culture or the life of a (real-life) merchant 
marine sailor.  The obvious exceptions would be Capital/Core, and 
systems where exploitation of space is a normal part of the economy 
(e.g.  Glisten, any system with many large colonies).  

    You have added an interesting point about "local" cultures 
"giving-up" on the stars *long* ago...  presumably when they were 
incorporated into the Sylean Empire, or when they grew beyond 
outpost/colony status.  This would be a side-effect (or deliberate 
intention) of the 3I policy of not allowing multi-system member 
states...  so there is NO interstellar culture except the Imperial 
"spacer" culture.  Contrast with the Solomani Confederation, which has 
large interstellar states with distinct cultures as members.  
    Unfortunately, what was destroyed in Hard Times and the Virus was 
the Imperial interstellar culture.  That has been utterly wiped out, 
except in the Regency.  In the pocket empires, and other places that 
are reaching for the stars again, we are seeing the local cultures, 
using the knowledge from the extinct Imperial culture, reach out 
"beyond the extrality fence" for the first time in a thousand years. 
The techonology *may* be initially based on Imperial designs, but the 
culture will not.  IMHO, the TNE interstellar culture outside the
Regency will not have an Imperial heritage.

I did some calculations along these lines with a _Covenanter_-class
starship crashing into an airless body with its maximum vector.  
I assumed that in the non-elastic collison, all of its kinetic
energy was liberated.  The equations ran:

Kinetic Energy = 0.5 * mass * (velocity squared)

Mass of ship = about 4000 metric tonnes = 4 million kg
Max. vector  = 80 G-turns = 1330 kps (= 0.4 % lightspeed)
KE of ship   = 0.5 * 4000000 kg * (1330000 m/s)^2
             = 3.54 * 10^18 joules
             = 840 megatons TNT

Some useful information on this sort of thing is in "Space FAQ 04/13 -
Calculations" in newsgroups sci.space, sci.astro, or news.answers.
(1 MT = 4.2 * 10^15 J) conversion came from that document, and there
is also an equation for meteor impact craters among other things.

I don\'t know what effect an atmosphere would have on these rough
figures.  Spacecraft are deadly weapons.  Note that a Virus-controlled
suicide ship attacking, say, a starport in this fashion would 
appear on ground-based 10 hex sensors at their maximum possible
detection range of 80 hexes *one 30 minute turn* before impact.
I suspect quite a bit of that sort of attack happened during the
Crash.  (no pun intended)

>WHAT IS IN A STARPORT?

I think a decent starport should have:
1)   A customs impound area. Warehouses where things like cargo
      being trans-shiped is stored. Usually deserted by 3pm, good 
      for gun battles between players and NPC badguys.
2)   Sleezy, run down resturants serving terrible food and worse 
       coffee, and over charging for it.
3)   Starship Maintance areas. 
4)   Starport Security. The police station and lockup. Manned by 
      guys like Worf on ST:TNG. Has at least one "goon-squad"
      that gets called out to handle drunken Vargr.
5)   A gambling den (or several), pawnshops, bookie joints, houses       of
"ill-repute"
6)    General purpose warehouses and business offices of cargo 
      forwarding and shipping companies.
7)   A passenger terminal
8)   Fuel processing and refueling docks
9)   Both long "runway" type landing areas [for horizonal take            
off/landing ships. and "field" areas [for vertical takeoff/landing      
ships].
10) GCA (Ground Controlled Approach) equipment, Comm       equipment, Radar,
etc.
11)  Space Traffic Control Tower.
12)  Emergency Medical facilities

The debate seems to have moved onto the role of the Regency in the
New Era but since I\'ve not been able to read my mail for the last
5 days I thought I\'d take the opportunity to briefly comment on some
of the replies to my postings.

David Johnson:  I feel that the democratic institutions of the
RC are believable.  The Collapse is stated to have destroyed the
old Imperial government - it didn\'t survive to rebuild (except in
the Regency and possibly in a few Pocket Empires).  With the
disappearance of the Imperium I don\'t see why local populations should
have continued to respect the holders of offices in its structure. 
Infact, the locals would have been more inclined to lynch the local
Imperial representative after all the suffering of the Rebellion and
then the Collapse (which lends support to your idea of a Revolution -
but I think that this would have happened in 1130 not in 1180).

Jeff Zeitlin suggested that the Hiver\'s may have re-introduced the idea
of democracy to the world\'s in the RC.  This may have happened (I think
that they\'d certainly encourage it) but I still believe that a strong
democratic tradition could have existed even despite the rule of the
Third Imperium.  My reasons: the Old Expanses was a part of the Solomani 
Sphere and only re-conquered by the Imperium during the Solomani Rim
War.  The Solomani (especially in the Sphere) are much more inclined
towards democratic government and the idea of freedom in general.  I
think this cultural belief in self-determination and individual freedom
would have remained even under Imperial rule.  With the Collapse, these
suppressed beliefs would have been allowed to re-appear (and fuelled
by the rejection of the Imperial system because of its\' responsibility
for the Rebellion and the Collapse).

Jeff also stated that there was no reason to believe that the Regency
or the Reformation Coalition would automatically regard a Virus-based 
interstellar civilistation emerging from behind the Black Curtain to
be an enemy.  Except, that is, for the fact that the Virus was 
responsible for destroying interstellar civilisation and plunging
humanity into a new Long Night and that in all of its\' most common 
forms it is completely hostile to all non-Virus.  I agree that a
Virus controlled civilisation could be non-aggressive and even
benevolent but it will take a lot of persuasion and proof to convince
the RC and the Regency of this.

I don\'t agree.  It would make more sense, as I see it, for the Regency to
expand and enlarge *now*, before anyone emerges from behind the Black
Curtain.  The bigger the Regency is, the less likely they are to be
challenged.  My assessment of Norris is that if a legitimate successor
did appear then he would be willing to swear allegiance and accept them
as Emperor.  However with all the democratic changes within the Regency,
the rest of the political establishment might not be too keen on this.
My view is infact the opposite of your view: you think that if an heir
appeared the ordinary joe in the Regency would be clamering to swear
allegiance while Norris (or his heir) would be desparately trying to
cling to power.  I think that Norris would be willing to accept the 
claimant to the throne while the Regency\'s population, enjoying its\'
newfound democratic freedom would be opposed to this.  Strange.

The upshot:  I\'m still not convinced that there are any good reasons
why the Regency shouldn\'t be doing what the RC is doing.

David Johnson continues:

I agree.  One of the weakest parts of the New Era setting is the time
scale that GDW presents.  As you point out, 70 years is a short enough
period for the high technology and institutions of the pre-Collapse
society to be in living memory.  The idea that 70 years after the Collapse
the survivors would be worshipping micro-wave ovens is idiotic, IMO.
Technology could be held responsible for the widespread destruction and
people could be (legitimately in the case of computers/robots and the
Virus) fearful of it, but I don\'t believe that they\'d be endowing it
with supernatural qualities so soon after it was a mundane part of their 
everyday lives.

Well, I\'m not too concerned with sticking to the `official\' campaign

I agree that a ref ought to be able to do as she pleases with

Well, I looked and didn\'t find anything on the jumpstart caches *or*

Ah, but it does!  GDW products ARE what create the TNE background.  So,
except where they switch themselves (as "Reavers" became "Star Vikings"
which became "Path of Tears", producing kinder, gentler Vikings), GDW\'s
products ARE the gospel.  Unfortunately, as you point out, they are not
always self-consistent, sensible or logical.

You would certainly save us all a good deal of time and space by
reading an explanation and then commenting on it instead of holding
forth on a topic in ignorance, waiting for a correction, and then 
replying to the correction, prompting responses (usually more detail
that you could have read in the first place) before getting to the 
heart of the discussion.

I, like you, however, choose not to buy TNE nor its supplements.

Ah, but man is a political animal:  if my planet or faction with 
RCES hired say my nephew\'s group, I won\'t let you come down overly
hard on him, nor will I let you publically discipline him as it
would make me look bad.

Not to mention the process for investigating an abuse:
1. Abuse occurs.
2. Raiders return with report slanted in their favor, especially if
   they bring back good profits.
3. Some time several months later, someone returns to site of abuse 
   and reports it.
4. A few (or many) months later, reports of such an abuse get back to
   RCES HQ, which sends out an investigation team.
5. A few months later (assuming transport is available & that the
   investigating org has a team available), a report suggesting
   disciplinary action appears.

Meanwhile, during the year (or more), the abuser has gone out for two
or three more missions....

Roger Sanger says:

Sure - as long as you remember the caveat that GDW will ignore most
of what is said here and will eventually sweep it all away with a 
sourcebook.

You may want to think this through again.  I don\'t mean to stifle
your creativity, but this is kinda silly.  There is a lot more to 
life than comfortable movement.  Let\'s discuss air.  Carrying around
your own air supply for the day is heavy, regardless of how comfy the
suit itself is.  Not to mention the dangers of sleeping on a limited
air supply.  Then there is food - these people ONLY eat food from
a tube through a helmet chowlock?  Not to mention the waste of 
heating up a fresher only to vent it all during EACH individuals
daily (weekly? monthly?) shower run.

What a herrless existence these people lead! They suffer from sensory
deprivation.  
Their skin ONLY gets to feel their undersuit.  
They smell ONLY themselves.
They hear ONLY what comes in over their headphones and their own
mutterings
They taste ONLY prepared mushy food they get through a tube.

Considering that well before TL15, insulation is good enough to build
space environments, I can\'t see why building an insulated house on a 
planet is difficult.  With good insulation, you won\'t lose much heat 
to the outside, so there goes the cost/efficiency problem.

Uh, considering that hardware runs BETTER in cold environments,
that software isn\'t affected by temperature at all, and that the
Virus doesn\'t seem to have a problem operating on ships open to 
space, I\'d suggest that the Virus would have no problem operating on
a cold planet\'s computers.

>This allowed the planet to progress
>without devoting much of its resources to combating the virus,

Except for the spare resources taken by the Regenecy gov to shore up 
other planets (zero spares above subsistence).  

Consider - the Regency needed to maintain a larger fleet than before
(say during the 5th Frontier War) in order to maintain the blockade,
and yet had to do so ONLY with local resources; the costs of such a 
fleet could not be supported by resources of the 3I interior.  To do
so, every spare resource would need to be spent just to maintain the
status quo.

>the Virus

You may want to re-read how the Virus operates.  If the Virus had 
gotten this far into the operating system of one major system (a 
floating city), it would have infected MOST major systems on a planet
and then manifested itself over the course of a few days.  Scratch 
one of the Darrians planets.  Not to mention those planets on the 
path from Deneb TO the Darrian worlds!!

This won\'t help against self-evolving software as GDW describes the
Virus to be.  It didn\'t help the Aslan (with different hardware &
software from Imperial systems).

And what of the trade that fed these worlds that kept them as hi-tech?
The trade cut off due to the Rebellion and Hard Times?  Like 
stopsville?  As these places lost their markets (no one to sell to), 
their economy declines.  Like lose a couple tech levels?  

It\'s all there in GDW\'s books.

There isn\'t?  Should we discuss the King of Silesia in one of the
Modules?  And if you read some of the notes between T:2000 & T:2300
there are several small kingdoms that pop up only to be swallowed...
And BTW, there are aristorcracy in the Regency, and that IS in the
same game.

Only about 1000 years or so (available from several sources).

Anyone spotted Challenge 72 in the US?  It was promised to be mailed

mid-jan & then out by the end of Feb, too).  Its now April 6 and no

Travelling through empty space on a known course is not that difficult
at all.  A bridge crew of 1 can do it, and simply sleep when he feels
like it - as long as he doesn\'t run into any problems.  I had no 
problem rigging the alarms into the in-ship intercom system to wake a
sleeping pilot for emergencies.  Of course, if something happened in 
time it took the pilot to wake and run to the bridge (if he wasn\'t 
sleeping there), he was up the creek w/o a paddle.

Hi All,
Regarding the Regency in the New Era:

I have the impression that fighting Virus 70 years after the collapse
would be close to what we deal with today concerning computer viruses.
As new threats are recognized, the infomation on how to prevent 
infection would be widely distributed.

Although virus protection will always be important, life shouldn\'t be
changed that much. Through the use of heavy patrols in Corridor, most
incoming threats could be neutralized before any population centers
are at risk. Of course all critical automated systems will have manual
overrides, but I always assumed that should have been the case anyway.
Virus or no Virus, software is never 100% bug free. There should have
been a plan for the possibilty of massive computer failure. If the 
Virus didn\'t destroy a civilization when first encountered, it isn\'t 
likely to do so 70 years later.

BTW, I expect that the natural astrography of Corridor is part of the 
reason why the Regency hasn\'t reclaimed that area. It forms such a nice
choke point at which to fight any intruders, Viral or otherwise. 
Besides, I\'m sure a lot of resources have been used developing an
infrastructure capable of withstanding a possible conflict.

I would like to see how the other races have fared since the collapse.
I would think that the Vargr would have been decimated and that the
Zhodani would be mostly unharmed. The Aslan behind the claw would
have fared much better than the rest of the Hierate. They could be 
quite a threat in the Trojan Reaches. 

I would guess that the Virus can\'t be maintained as an interesting 
and challenging foe in the Regency for very long. The end result 
may in fact be that GDW can "have their Imperium and destroy it too."
I don\'t like the Virus as the cause of the collapse. However, at least 
where it matters most to Imperium fans ( the Regency ) the effects 
shouldn\'t be that bad.

In my campaign set further spinward of the Regency, I used to use the 
official GDW campaign info as news from the Old Empire. During the 
rebellion, it was common for mercenary companies from the frontier 
to fight with one of the factions (rather like the barbarians being
hired to defend Rome). I expect that once the collapse occurs,
contact will be completely lost. If I like the look of the Regency,
I may make a recontact mission the thrust of a new campaign.

Thanks for clearing the William Penn question, you beat me to the punch.  In
addition to getting rid of the Quakers the crown also used the grant to repay
a debt originally incurred to Penn\'s father.

Space colonies and the like have been covered in Traveller.  The
following references come to mind:
 
    The "Sky Raiders" trilogy from fasa, by the Keith brothers.
 
    Gateway Station (in Gateway Sector) in "Lords of Thunder", by
    William H. Keith, Jr., published in DGP\'s MegaTraveller
    Journal #4.  There\'s also an inhabited natural satellite
    around another planet in the sector that is an integral part
    of the adventure.
 
    The orbital facility in fasa\'s Adventure Class Ships
    Volume II is a must-have item.  Modular and multi-functional.
 
    The gutted-out Kinunir class colonial cruiser in orbit around
    Pixie/Regina/Spinward Marches is covered in Adventure 1 - The
    Kinunir.
 
    Adventure 11 - Murder on Arcturus Station includes an
    interesting illustration of that facility.
 
    Many orbital starport facilities are mentioned in Traveller
    literature, and although they aren\'t colonies per se, they
    subsume that function by having permanent residents.  The
    only one that comes to mind orbits Regina/Regina/Spinward
    Marches.
 
Okay..., you asked for advice on designing space colonies, so
you\'ve got it:
 
    First, for quick-and-dirty asteroid colonies, since they are
    so much like dungeons hewn from solid rock, many Ad&d modules
    work quite well for the basic floorplans of such a facility.
 
    At least such modules can give you an idea of where to start
    -- The "Ghost Tower of Inverness" could easily be adapted
    into an orbital space colony.  Simply trace the outline for
    each level onto graph paper, and then redraw the interiors.
 
    The best AD&D module that comes in mind for this however, is
    "Expedition to the Barrier Peaks", which includes the plans
    for the Metamorphosis Alpha, a huge spacefaring craft
    designed for housing colonist during their long but fateful
    voyage. All you need to do to use this is dump its drives.
 
    Another tip is to use examples from movies/TV and literature
    as models.  Moonraker, Aliens, Star Trek II - The Wrath of
    Khan, Deepspace Nine, Red Dwarf (several episodes), Star
    Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, 2001: A Space Odesy, Star
    Cops, Dr. Who, and Space 1999, all include examples of space
    habitations.  The deep sea habitat in "The Abyss" could also
    prove useful as a model.
 
    The thing most useful in designing anything is a list of
    specifications and features/facilities to include.  Off the
    top of my head, here are some things that would be needed in
    a space colony:
 
        Production facilities for or importation of food.
        Dining facilities, if not included in living quarters.
        Kithen facilities, if not included in living quarters.
        Sanitation and waste disposal facilities.
        Starport/docking facilities.
        Hospital and clinic, with medlabs.
        Recreation facilities.
            Movie theater
            Concert hall
            Swimming pool
            Indoor track
            Grav ball arena
            Workout gym
            Dancehall/nightclub
            Games room
        Control center.
        Atrarium.
        Offices.
        Shops.
        Workshops/repair stations.
        Storage.
        Cold sleep facilities / emergency low berths.
        Meeting facilities.
        Science labs.
        Computers.
        Education facilities.
        Library.
        Security stations.
        Detention cells.
        Surveylance systems.
        Emergency stations.
        Laundry facilities.
        Customs and quarantine facilities.
 
        Lighting.
        Emergency lighting (dimmed to conserve power).
        An intercom system.
        Living quarters.
        Air locks.
        Air importation or recycling.
        Gravity generation or simulation.
        Hatches
        Sealable sections
 
Did I leave anything out?
 
Hope that helps,
Rodge.

paranoid (Viruphobia?).  Consider the Quarantine blockade they set up and
after 75 years continue to man.  Private individuals would have great
difficulty crossing the border (although those seldom used bureaucratic
skills
would certainly come into play in this situation).

There is some mention that the Regency economy is beginning to stagnate and
referendum re. opening the borders was held but rejected.  Since when do
gov\'ts follow to the letter the will of the people?  And as recently pointed
out various gov\'t agencies frequently pursue their own agendas.

There is also the matter of the nobility.  Under the new form of gov\'t the
nobles were given fiefs but what about their younger children?  No doubt the
eldest will inherit the fief but the younger sons & daughters are not just
going to all embrace the democratic way of life that the commoners adhere to.

I see two activities re exploration of the wilds from the Regency:

1)  The gov\'t will begin to send secret missions of exploration and contact.
There are no doubt those who remember the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service
and its proud traditions - the glory of going where no one has gone before
instead of playing Quarantine Police.  These missions would have many of the
some objectives of the RCES missions.  In addition the Regency has better
data, yes it is also out of date, specifing locations of bases and research
stations and the contents of those bases.  More on this in future
installments
(the Scouts are my favorite service!)

2)  The young nobility seeing limited prospects in the new order of things
will look for elbow room.  Their parents will likely support their wishes to
explore the Wilds as it will ease tensions at home (and decrease internecine
conflict to determine who shall inherit the fief.  Expeditions will be
outfitted and launched toward the core of the former Imperium.  Some will
conquer/colonize/set up shop on some of the planets and begin trading via
free
merchants with each other and, for those with the bureaucratic patience, with
the Regency.  Others will seek out riches in smash-and-grab/looting type
expeditions with an eye toward high profit items such as starships and
locating the warehouses of the former MegaCorps.

As mentioned I have more to say re scouts in the future but ta ta for now.

                   ----
 
I noticed some notes passed back and forth on the location of
various sectors near the Spinward Marches, so I thought I\'d blow
up the region for you from my Traveller MaxThink hypernet.
 
Here is a sector chart of the region surrounding the Spinward Marches,
including the foreign names.  The developer is also shown, where known.
 
The Regency is located in the Spinward Marches, Deneb, and Reft
Sectors.  It used to extend into Trojan Reach Sector, but I think
the Aslan New Lords took over that territory during the Rebellion
era.

A couple of weeks ago, John H Bogan <john.bogan@asb.com>
gave us an overview of *Path of Tears*, the Coalition
sourcebook.  I\'ve used his template here for a fictional
Regency sourcebook, which I\'ve called *Shall Not Perish*.
I hope y\'all will help me fill it in.

THE REGENCY:

> mostly a reprint of the RC timeline, though some 
> parts have been expanded and more detail added.

Anyone care to expand on or add detail to the New Era
Regency timeline?  What significant (or just plain
interesting) details are missing?

> the original 12 ships sent out by the Dawn League,
> with ship name, type, sceduled course, and fate

Would the establishment of the Quarantine Line be
the Regency equivalent here?

> maps and UWP data for Aubaine (ex-Nicosia) and 
> Oriflamme (ex-Sarid) subsectors.

Would more than two subsectors be detailed for the
Regency?  Which ones?  Trin\'s Veil?  Regina?
Rhylanor?

> Each world has two lines of 
> UWP data, first the pre-Rebellion and then the New 
> Era stats.

Certainly this is simple enough for Regency worlds.
 
> a breif description of each world within the RC

Another simple task, but maybe just a focus on `major\'
worlds in the Regency?

> an overview of the RC government such as it is

What would an overview of the Regency government
include?  Should we use the *World Builder\'s*
model and identify executive, legislative and
judicial authority in the Regency?  What about
principal NPCs (the Regent, etc.)

> a table listing each world, its population,
> political
> bloc it belongs to, and number of representatives
> in the Assembly.

It\'s been suggested that the Regency is more
`democratic\' than the Imperium was.  `Representation\'
in the Imperium was through the aristocracy.  What\'s
the situation for the Regency?

PEOPLE OF THE REGENCY:

> the eight major political issues
> within the Coalition, most of which are actually
> matters of

What major political issues face the Regency?  What is
the internal structure of the Regency?  What is it\'s
attitude toward the exterior?  What\'s the nature of
this `democracy\' in the Regency?  How did it arise?
What are all those former aristocrats doing now that
there are `commoners\' serving as governors and such?

> "typical" views of persons from each of the 
> RC\'s major worlds on the Coalition itself, the other

This ought to be simple enough once the major worlds of
the Regency are identified.  The Regency includes Vargr
and Aslan, right?  What minor races exist?

> a glossary of RC jargon, about half of which appeared

For the Regency would this be a guide to the `Riftian\'
dialect after 70 years of divergence?

> RCES OPERATIONS:

Would the Regency equivalent be the `Patrol\'(?) that
Norris created shortly after the Domain was cut off from
the Imperium?  How does this mesh with the entity 
responsible for maintaining the Quarantine?

> RCES mission types, doctrines, and general tactics.

Seems pretty straightforward to do the same for the
Patrol/Quarantine.

> the defensive (ground, wet, and COACC) forces oef the

The Regency would also have significant naval forces,
wouldn\'t it?

Simple enough.  You shipwrights out there ought to have
a field day.

> the economics of the RC and the Auction(s), both
> in general terms and in player-level terms 
> (their cut from the 
> auction, etc.)

Would Quarantine procedures be the equivalent here?

THE AO (AREA OF OPERATIONS):

> an overview of RCES objcetives for the next 5+ years

What\'s the mission of the Patrol/Quarantine?

> player maps of Promise (Diaspora L), Khulam 
> (Diaspora P), Thoezennt (Old Expanses I), and

> subsectors, in the same format used for Aubaine &
> Oriflamme.  Outside

If the Regency isn\'t venturing beyond the Quarantine Line
what\'s the equivalent here?  Would subsectors on the
Zhodani, Vargr, Aslan and/or Virus(?) frontiers be appro-
priate?  What about Darrian and the Sword Worlds?

> maps and world data for 19 Wilds worlds.

Again, what\'s the Regency equivalent?

REFEREE\'S INFORMATION:

> general GM advice. Sidebar on the distinction between
> Free Traders (the people, capitalized) and free traders
> (the ships,
> lower case).

Is there an organization(s) in the Regency that corresponds
to the Guild?  Not necessarily more merchants but one
that has a different agenda than the Regency government?
 
> notes and rules on detailing worlds. Rules for

This would all be pretty much the same, wouldn\'t it?
 
> Ref\'s data and notes for the subsectors and detailed

Similar stuff should be simple enough.

> The Star Guild, a loose organization of

Again, what entities in the Regency have their own agendas?

> stats on personal equipement and vehicles

More grist for the iron-mongerers!

> Manta-class skimmers
> expands the information on the
> Aurora clippers from what was presented in BL.

Again, you shipwrights can have at the Regency ships.

> Finally,
> an index, which, at first look, seems pretty complete.

This is a must!  :-)

That\'s all of John\'s template.  Remember, I don\'t have TNE
so I may have left some major points out that are included
there.  What other aspects of the Regency aren\'t covered
in TNE or by this template?

That should get us started.

Enjoy!

 Let\'s start with the fundamentals.  That circumference that you 
 have is equal to 2*pi*r (pi is that familiar constant, 
 approximated badly by the fractions 22/7 or 355/113).  The area of 
 a sphere is 4*pi*r^2 (r^2 is "r squared", or r*r).

 Now, (4*pi*r*r)/(2*pi*r)=2*r, which equals (2*pi*r)/pi.  So, given 
 the circumference C, we can arrive at the surface area by using 
 the formula

 C*C/pi.

 I\'d concede that this would be possible, except that the K\'kree 
 have been established as being somewhat intolerant of what the 
 other races that have been spotlighted would consider "normal 
 social diversity."  Should any K\'kree pocket empire, especially 
 one with its center on Kirur, struggle to its feet without outside 
 aid, it will exhibit all of the characteristics of the original 
 K\'kree culture - in fact, it will, for the most part _be_ the 
 original K\'kree culture.  The natural K\'kree intolerance of 
 diversity is such that if an "Old K\'kree" empire were to confront 
 a "K\'kree RC", the Old K\'kree would be compelled to exterminate 
 the K\'kree RC.  Remember what happened to the K\'kree planets on 
 which the Hivers demonstrated their ability to manipulate 
 cultures.  On those planets, they had "perverted" the K\'kree into 
 finding acceptable the consumption of meat sauces on food, and the 
 use of solitude as recreation - both things that are against the 
 established fundamental nature of the K\'kree.  I can\'t think of 
 any "aberrations" of human culture that would generate such a 
 reaction in the rest of humanity.

 Remember, the aliens in Traveller are truly _alien_.  While some 
 of their behavior might be characterizable through the use of 
 comparisons to human behaviors, this is anthropomorphising of the 
 worst kind.  Their motivations are _not_ those of humans, and 
 they cannot be expected to react to stimuli the way humans do.

 It\'s as relevant as saying that cities like New York, Chicago, and 
 Los Angeles "make up" the United States, or that countries like 
 the United States, the United Kingdom, and the People\'s Republic 
 of China "make up" the United Nations.  Certainly, there\'s a lot 
 of influence concentrated there.  But would the US be able to 
 survive without the "backwaters" of western Wisconsin, or upstate 
 New York, where there are a lot of dairy farms, or the 
 "backwaters" of central Nebraska and South Dakota, where a lot of 
 wheat is grown?  The Imperium was a whole, with all planets 
 contributing.  In different ways, but they all contributed.  The 
 fact that all 11,000 worlds didn\'t appear in the TNS doesn\'t mean 
 anything; my small town, for instance, hasn\'t made a New York 
 Metro region newspaper in several years - and when it last did, it 
 was because there was a murder committed within the town limits.  
 Yet this same town is home to many UN diplomats, and many 
 high-level executives of big corporations.

 No, I\'m not saying that worlds without a tech affinity are the 
 ones that are going to be ghettoized.  I\'m saying that the ones 
 that are "forced" to focus their production to service the needs 
 of the planets that (re)acquire tech early are the ones that are 
 going to be ghettoized.  A TL12 planet whose sole industry is 
 exporting starship power systems, without building any ships of 
 its own, is as surely ghettoized as any arbitrary corner of the 
 United States whose sole reason for existance is to send whatever 
 it produces to the major cities of the coasts.

The computer wakes the pilot up. Technically there should be a 24 hour

the pilot to tell it where to go. If it weren\'t that automated you\'d probably
need at least 3 bridge crew (6 on/12 off, something like what we have

My take on this was that Strephon foresaw a second Long Night and planned 
accordingly.  This would imply that scattered across formal Imperial 
Space there are some really nice goodies!  Now Norris was told all of 
their locations so this gives him the edge on the RC and any Pocket 
Empires out there.  This seems to be the only way you can have quatations 
from NE 44 that imply that the Imperium is back togather in some way 
shape or form.

Also, the big reason the Regency isn\'t cruising all over the Wilds is the 
"RAPE OF TRIN" when a Vampire vessal got through and wrecked havoc...

In Addition, IF you bring your ship into the Regency, you LEAVE it at the 
BORDER!  It is a true quarentine in that regard.

UPDATE
I\'ve been on holiday for a while, hence haven\'t replied to those of you who\'ve
been e-mailing me in the last two weeks.
APOLOGY
Re: 563/7072 (from myself)
My last upload included a graphic description of someone nasty being very
nasty to a heroine, resulting in her giving him a good kick where he deserved
it. I would like to apologise if any of the content of this fictional example
offended anyone.
I would just like to add that with regard to the sexual side of the encounter
(I\'ll bet that\'s got you scrabbling to find the mailing) the text I used was
quite deliberately graphical. This is a technique that I use with my Traveller
group(s) to build up the tension, slowly, sentence by sentence. Not only do
some of my female players take full advantage of their sexuality in such
circumstances (in effect taking advantage of the weakness of men), but in
addition their sense of revengeful satisfaction at the point where they get
to counter-attack their aggressor is heightened by the slow build-up. I have
also found that release of violent emotions in the game can sometimes help
people deal with real events, whether it be getting rid of the tension after
a hard day\'s work, or simulated revenge on someone who\'s been nasty to them
at some other time. I\'m sorry if this carry-over from my own (adult) games
offended anyone. If so, I suggest they disconnect their TV and keep to the
children\'s shelf at the library. :)
I fully support women and their equal rights - my own wife has to put up with
working in a particularly sexist group and therefore I know first-hand how
hard it is for some women. Therefore I tend to let her (and others) express
their feelings in my games - as long as they only act in defence (I don\'t like
to encourage needless aggression, hence my frequent use of high law-level
worlds in my games).
I\'d be interested in anyone else\'s views in this field (unless it\'s already
been discussed prior to me joining TML, of course).
REFUELLING
Re: 562/7068 (Grant Sinclair)
Refuelling in oceans might seem the easy option to saving money on fuel bills,
however I had the following thoughts:
1) Refuelling from oceans will be frowned on for ecological reasons
(disturbance of wildlife, plankton, etc., particularly if from a small lake,
etc.)
2) There may only be limited safe landing places around such seas, allowing
that some ships can\'t hover, others might not like total submersion, many
beaches, cliffs, marshes, etc. are unsuitable for a heavy ship, etc. The
remaining \'safe\' sites have no beacons or other landing aids and, unless the
players have a priori knowledge of the site, may hide some nasty shocks
(sudden land slippage, unpleasant flora or fauna, etc.) "Hmm. Just land on
that sand over there... how could you know it looks like quicksand from up
here? Don\'t be silly, just land the damned ship... er... ooops...)
3) Such landing places may be unreachable due to air traffic control laws,
private property ownership, fishing rights, tribal law, religious significance
of the body of water concerned, etc.).
4) Alternatively, certain landing places may be legalised, with a usage fee
(say, about the same price as unrefined fuel at starport rates...)
5) Many ships (particularly the really big merchants) are too big to land
anyway, so they would tend to rely on small shuttles (for maximum speed they\'d
use a known approach path and quick refuelling facilities... i.e. a starport)
or the main ship could dock with an orbiting starbase (problem solved).
6) All in all, any large merchant ship is going to take the known route every
time, i.e. the starport. We all know how short cuts always take longer, so a
sensible captain pays the few credits for the fuel bill, given that a detour
to a sea might (due to Sod\'s Law, etc.) delay him or cost him more money in
the long run.
FURTHER...
In continuation to the comment about refuelling, i.e. that this makes merchant
ships much more economical to run...
1) surely most ships ought to still be paying off their \'mortgage\'; if that
isn\'t a fair outlay each month then you\'re making it too easy for them. Ships
shouldn\'t just be given away - the mortgage is a good excuse to press players
into doing any job they can for almost any money, encourages them into
smuggling, etc. making life much more interesting...
2) whether the ship\'s mortgage has been paid off or not, I still charge my
characters for its usage by making them pay maintenance costs. These are some
small percentage of the total ship cost per year, with them having the option
of doing the work themselves (reduce %) or having others do the work (increase
%). In either case they can pay for good parts and good skills (increase %)
or not (reduce %) or not at all (zero %). Their choices then influence the
ship\'s jump, pilot, computer, etc. rolls throughout the game. A bad failure
on a well-maintained ship will generally not cost too much to repair... but
a badly maintained ship... well, you can just see the engineer\'s face as he
examines the damage, that knowledgeable sigh and tutting sound as he adds up
the megacredits of repair bill (ever taken your car into a garage and had the
same treatment?)
LANGUAGES
Re: Multiple messages over past week
There was a pretty good article about Languages in JTAS. I have a copy of the
article but don\'t know which issue it was from [Roger Sanger may like to look
this up on his index system and mail in the issue number].
Given that there may be a sudden rush to buy translation machines, and given
the Virus (oh no!) might have extended a few less virulent tentacles to such
(or a disenchanted programmer or a programming fault, whatever), how about
giving your players a translator that acts about as well as the Monty Python
Swedish/English dictionary.
Player, beginning trade negotiations with Vargr, speaking into translator:
"Greetings fellow star merchant. May the sun shine upon your cargos"
Translator: "Vrgahh sghett ajskj dyuyer qiuu qoid hhhh"
Vargr Captain fingers Gauss pistol under table, having just heard translation:
"Yo werewolf features. Your mother wears combat boots"
Vargr, realising translator might be at fault, replies:
"I think your translator needs correction, but welcome anyway"
Players hear: "hhjasd iudkfn wifu asuu qwwjwjd ashdjhqw dhajsd"
and then (from translator): "Stick it up your *&#$ you slimey Vilani"
Gun fight ensues...
If this isn\'t the Virus\' ideal ploy - getting people to kill each other, then
I don\'t know what is...
COMPUTER GRAPHICS FILES
I\'ve been trying to get EPS (expanded postscript) files across e-mail. After
all, they\'re text-based and if split into reasonable sizes ought to transfer
across the network... but I\'ve not had any success yet so if anyone has got
it to work, please contact me. EPS can be included (in a non-editable, but re-
sizeable form) into some wordprocessors (e.g. Microsoft Word, Wordperfect) and
graphics programs (e.g. Freelance). GIF files are more generic with regard to
displaying but generally need transferring to another format to edit and
aren\'t as flexible as EPS for re-sizing, etc. I\'d be interested to know if
anyone has an alternative way of transferring graphics files using e-mail
(rather than relying upon a ftp site).
NEWSPAPERS
Re: 563/7076 (jeff.zeitlin)
Yes please, more news articles, etc. Anything that can be made into a
scenario. Even minor stuff can at least be going on in the background so that
when the players come into system and ask for a news broadcast to see what\'s
going on down on a planet I don\'t just say \'Oh, the usual\'...
ER...
I think that\'s it. Thanks for listening.

I liked PB Juzyk\'s idea of the sons and daughters of the former ruling
class in the Regency heading out into the Wilds to found new feofdoms.
This would be quite permissible under the conditions of the Blockade
since it would be a one way trip.  However, it would leave the government
of the Regency facing a possible future rival in its\' immediate 
neighbourhood.  Also, the establishment of these colonies would be fuelled
by a drain of people and resources from the Regency economy.  If trade
was not permitted because of the Blockade, then the Regency would have
nothing to gain from letting this colonisation take place (except a
more stable and peaceful political environment).

The idea of an official policy of re-colonisation also has promise but
this would come up against the public fear of the Virus making an incursion 
into the Regency.  This would be easier to achieve if it was a secret, 
unofficial policy.  Since the TNE manual describes the Regency government\'s
secret attempts to create a benign form of the Virus it would be quite
in character for this to be taking place at the same time.  I would 
imagine that the Regency is currently mounting Arrival Vengeance
type missions to explore the Wilds and re-contact the remenants of the
former Third Imperium, possibly with a view to re-integrating them into
itself (Traveller: the Next Generation anyone?)

David Johnson\'s proposed Regency sourcebook seems like a fair jumping off
point for a discussion about the possible shape of the Regency. 
Unfortunately, since I don\'t have my copy of the TNE manual with me I\'m
not in a position to answer some of his questions.  I would imagine that
a fierce political debate is currently taking place within the Regency
about whether to attempt to re-contact worlds within the Wilds or not.
Also there will be a fair amount of tension between the new Democrats
and the Old Aristocrats as well as the pro-psionic lobby vs. the anti
psi (anti-Zhodani) faction.

However all of this will just be idle speculation until GDW do something
solid on the Regency.  And I don\'t see that happening in the next two
years (there was no mention, as far as I can recall, of any Regency
sourcebook in the GDW production schedule that was around a few weeks
ago).

Re: Ted7,


Whilst I agree with much of what you said in the (April 7) last posting, like

>> hardware runs better in cold environments...etc.

you could have proposed some alternative ideas instead of merely shooting down
the ones put forward. Yes, I know some of the ideas were maybe unfeasible, but
where are your new ideas/planets/people?

And also, as we are dealing with tech much in advance of anything we can 
build at the moment, we simply don\'t know if some things will or will not work.

For example, the point about DET computing systems not helping against the
self-evolving Virus, simply because of the way GDW described it, and the fact
that the Aslan were affected, is simply not a valid point. Maybe they have 
discovered something new, that does pose a serious problem to the Virus, not
simply being a different OS or whatever. As a (serious...not really) software
engineer, I liked some of the ideas, certainly the cyberpunk-esque idea of
warriors defeating the virus mano a mano (sp?) in a virtual world. Anything is
possible. 

Opinions are fine, but your postings like 

>> And what of the trade that fed these worlds that kept them as hi-tech?
>> The trade cut off due to the Rebellion and Hard Times?  Like 
>> stopsville?  As these places lost their markets (no one to sell to), 
>> their economy declines.  Like lose a couple tech levels?  

have left many questions unanswered. How about some answers?

                      MaxThink Special Offer
                      ----
 
 
I was not expecting such a high volume of replies concerning
MaxThink!  Though, it sure seems like the product was designed
with RPG\'ers in mind.
 
I haven\'t seen Neil Larson, the author of MaxThink, since he
stayed at my home as my guest back in 1990, when he flew up to
speak to my computer club at the time (I was the newsletter
editor for the Pacific Northwest IBM PC Users Group).  We
hobnobbed about hypertext and MaxThink for 3 days straight, while
a friend of mine and I showed him around the Puget Sound.  This
was quite a treat, since I consider Neil Larson one of the
foremost experts on the subject.  His products are unequalled in
the industry.
 
I was no less than thrilled to have him sit by at my computer
station, while I gave him a tour of his own program, pointing out
bugs and making suggestions for its improvement.  I was a bit
nervous at first, but once you get me talking about hypertext,
it\'s hard to get me to stop.  I was in good company, and we
swapped many hyper-tips.
 
He also spoke to my Hypertext Special Interest Group, and
explained some of the finer points of hypernet construction, idea
generation, and knowledge organization.
 
Since then, I\'ve spoken to him a couple times on the phone, but
for the most part have kept up to date through his customer
newsletter.  I no longer run the SIG, but compute almost
exclusively with hypertext programs (which I use to generate and
organize my ideas and notes on every subject), and have converted
a few friends over to hypertext in the past couple years.
 
Your queries got me to thinking.  I figured it was about time I
gave Neil a call, to catch up on old times.  TML\'s own James
Perkins made the comment in regards to my initial MaxThink
posting that I should become a salesman for the TML (and if he
hadn\'t been joking I would have taken him up on it!), and that
got me wondering whether or not I should actually sell MaxThink
rather than just spout off about it.  Heck, I\'ve relied on the
program continuously for years and know it cold.  So, I called
Neil Larson, figuring I might be able to work out some kind of
discount for my friends on the TML.
 
Yep, Neil still talks a mile a minute and it is quite hard to
keep up with him unless you run!  However, when it comes to
Traveller or hypertext, I manage quite well, since I eat and
breath these two subjects.  The end results of the conversation
were as follows:
 
        1)  I am now a distributor of MaxThink, and have been
        authorized to pass on a 10% discount to you.  MaxThink
        is a DOS application and works on IBM compatibles (sorry,
        there is no Mac version), and its price is $89.00 plus
        shipping.  After the 10% discount, that comes to $80 plus
        shipping. (Don\'t let the low price fool you, the program
        does run circles around conventional wordprocessors, as
        it has many commands simply not available in any other
        program.  It does not have the sophisticated WYSIWYG
        formatting of Word or WordPerfect, instead, it is
        designed for the manipulating of text rather than the
        fancy displaying of it).
 
        2)  I may be working on the help system for the next
        version of MaxThink, but discussions on this topic were
        rather vague.  Neil is planning something far more
        sophisticated than I had in mind, so I\'m not sure if
        there will be textual help in it at all!  What he
        mentioned almost blew my mind.  More on this at a later
        date.
 
I guess the next step is for me to write up a more specific
account of how MaxThink can be used to organize Traveller
material and how it can help in the design of Traveller
adventures, background, rules, and components (NPC\'s, equipment,
technology briefs, etc.).  Expect something in the next few days.
 
For those of you who already know you want the product, send a
check or money order for $80 plus $6 shipping to:

        For future reference, my physical address is 1021 NE
        123rd, Seattle, WA  98125.
 
        My voice phone is:  (206) 363-1094
 
 
Be sure to include your mailing address and voice phone just in
case.
 
And yes, I\'d be glad to help anyone who purchases the product
from me to get started.  I\'m in the process of working on a
Traveller-related MaxThink outline for that very purpose, and
shall have it ready to include with orders by the time I ship.
It shall be based on my own Traveller hypernet\'s organization,
and will include subject categories in an outline\'s tree
structure to help you organize your Traveller writings.
 
A companion product to MaxThink is Transtext, a hypertext
wordprocessor which can be called from within MaxThink, or
seperately from the DOS command line.  From within any text file
that includes jump referencing filenames in angle brackets
<likethis>, Transtext will view those files with but the press of
a single key, and can view files referenced within those files,
and within those files, etc., while keeping track of the path
taken from file to file so that you can backtrack.  When you find
a text file in your hypernet that you want to edit, another key
allows you to pull that file into Transtext, which has six
editing windows.  Transtext comes with a runtime hypertext viewer
that you can package with your hypernet creations, while MaxThink
has a utility that can convert MaxThink outlines into
hyperlinkied file-nets.  MaxThink has the same file viewer built
into it so that it can view any file that you write using
Transtext.  (Both file formats are strictly ASCII, and can be
edited with other programs if you desire).
 
I prefer to use MaxThink outlines as the core to my hypernet,
with text files linked to it via angle brackets included in the
topic (paragraph) nodes.  Thus I\'ve attached to my personal
Traveller campaign outlines every single text file I\'ve
downloaded from sunbane, many of which I\'ve converted to MaxThink
outline format (a matter of spacing and placement of carriage
returns and line feeds within the file).
 
Transtext is available for the same price as MaxThink, and the
10% discount applies to anything from MaxThink, Inc. that you
purchase from me.
 
Feel free to email me your questions.
 
It\'s time for me to burn some midnight oil!
 
            Sincerely,
 
            A hypertext freak,
 
            Roger Sanger.

    There was a good article a long time ago in Challenge (# not 
handy) for the Star Trek RPG about starship traffic patterns 
in-system.  The ideas in the article are/were portable to both 
Traveller and 2300AD.  As for your example system with ports, etc, I 
would like a copy "on-screen" so I can download it... I\'m too lazy to 
send mail for things.
    Also, for one of my PBSEM turns sometime ago, I wrote up some 
information about in-system navigation, and spatial positioning 
systems.  I\'ll dig it out and post it, if anyone is interested... or

I would like to see how the other races have fared since the collapse.
I would think that the Vargr would have been decimated and that the
Zhodani would be mostly unharmed. The Aslan behind the claw would...

Cynthia:

    Why?  Decimating Vargr is like nailing jello to a wall...

 True, but there are limits to that kind of ability.  If you\'ve 
 seen a planet get sacked by a homicidal Virus-infected starship, 
 you\'re _not_ going to be easily convinced that Virus isn\'t a 
 threat any more...

 The threat that I was thinking of in my previous posts, that 
 required guarding the Vargr border was in fact the threat of 
 Virus.  Consider: some of the Vargr states coreward of the Regency 
 went along with Norris\'s program of sealed borders.  Some likely 
 did not.  Vargr alliances are notoriously unstable, because of the 
 psychological makeup of the Vargr themselves.  So, the best that 
 Norris (and the Zhodani, for that matter) could hope for was that 
 Virus would be slowed down, not stopped, in the Spinward Extents.  
 This would also have the effect of slowing down the evolution 
 and/or extinction of Virus in the Extents, making infection from 
 the Extents a very real threat, even at this late date.  Given 
 that the Aslan are "more reliable", it\'s probably safer for them 
 to consider recolonization/recontact of what used to be the main 
 portion of the Hierate than it is for the Regency to expand back 
 into Corridor, along the Vargr border.  Norris _must_ tread 
 carefully with respect to the Extents; not doing so could be 
 fatal.

T::>IMHO, the *primary* threat to the Regency is that posed by an opponent that

 This is a very good thought, especially as we do _not_ know what 
 is going on behind the Curtain.  It is certainly a valid 
 possibility, but...

 We who have Arrival Vengeance know that (a) the Strephon that 
 entered the fray from a base in Gushemege is in fact the _real_ 
 Strephon, and (b) he effectively abdicated in Norris\'s favor by 
 entrusting Norris with the complete Jumpstart and Longbow files, 
 and the boy Avery (who we still know nothing about, although I 
 have my own suspicions...).  Given that Norris _does_ have a great 
 deal of ability in molding opinion, and that he (and his 
 successors) have enjoyed the support of an overwhelming majority 
 of the people of the Regency, even a documented successor to Lucan 
 or Margaret is unlikely to gain sympathy in the Regency, as they 
 represent the part of the old order that "abandoned" the area 
 "behind the claw." I would say that the "legitimacy" of the 
 Regency is secure, especially as it is also recognized by 
 Non-Imperial cultures (the Zhodani and Aslan Ihatei, primarily) 
 as having that legitimacy.

I noticed the omission of personnel shelters used for emergencies
which IMHO should be quite prolific around such installations,
given the horsepower to weight ratios involved in these ships
any accident, while not very common, would probably eliminate the

Note that \'[SOF]\' is start of file.  That isn\'t really in the file.
\'[EOF]\' is end of file.  \'<tab>\' is for the tab character, and blank
lines seperate the data bits.

The first program is the shell script that runs it.




- ---- cut here ---- cut here ----

BIN1=build_list
BIN2=spit_list

cat $* | ${BIN1} | sort -uf | awk -F\'|\' -f ${BIN2}
- ---- cut here ---- cut here ----




The next program is the source for build_list.  Build it 
with your favorite compiler:



- ---- cut here ---- cut here ----
/*
  part one of the cross referencing program.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

#define MAX_ENTRIES 5000


main ()
{
  char *current;
  char  line[MAX_ENTRIES],
        header[MAX_ENTRIES];

  strcpy (header, "XXXXX");
  while ((fgets (line, MAX_ENTRIES, stdin)) != NULL) {
    if (strlen(line) != 1) {
      while ((current = strchr(line, \'\\n\')) != NULL) {
        *current = \'\\000\';
      }
      if (line[0] != \'\\t\') {
        strcpy (header, line);
      }
      else {
        current = line;
        current++;
        strcpy (line, current);
        printf ("%s|%s\\n", header, line);
        printf ("%s|%s\\n", line, header);
      }
    }
  }
}
- ---- cut here ---- cut here ----




finally there is the awk program spit_list



- ---- cut here ---- cut here ----
BEGIN {
  LAST="XXXXXX"
}

{
  if ( $1 != LAST ) {
    print " "
    print "----"
    print " "
    print $1
    LAST = $1;
  }
  print "	" $2
}
- ---- cut here ---- cut here ----

eventually I\'ll modify spit_list to generate psroff output; however,
I\'m happy with it as it stands.  This should generate really nice
patterns of data.  If you run my datfile from a few days ago though
the shell script, you\'ll see what I mean.  I\'m very open to
suggestions on improvements.  If anyone takes the time to put the 
three programs together as one programme, I\'d like to see the result.

P.S.  If anyone takes the time to make cross reference entries, send
them to me and I\'ll add them to my database.

With regard to deckplan generation, I use Freelance for Windows v2 to draw
them up then (pretty much in the style of CT Supp7 Traders and Gunboats).
FLW is a \'professional\' graphics package for PCs. It has a screen grid so
I calculate the ship dimensions and adjust the grid size to give the right
1.5m spacing, with \'iconized\' doors, accel couches, etc. By \'iconized\' I mean
I have a standard stock of pre-drawn items, again using the style of Supp7.

If anyone is feeling really frustrated at not being able to draw good deck
plans we might be able to come to some agreement; you e-mail me a design with
notes on how you expected it laid out, or snail mail me a sketch of the deck
plans, and I\'ll draw you up a pretty picture. I can output to most graphics
formats (so I could return GIF versions, etc. via some mutual ftp address),
or hardcopy (good quality laser printer). We\'d have to come to some
arrangement about costs (perhaps a swap for some Traveller material).

Obviously it would be better if people had access to their own drawing
packages but I have the advantage that I use FLW regularly and thus can get
some quite good output.

Any thoughts? Anyone interested or got a better idea?

I can. Cannibalism, ritual murder, as part of a society would generate
this sort of reaction.

Funnily enough, symbolically speaking, cannibalism, ritual murder (for the

I think I\'ve stumbled across a notion of the Virus that actually 
WORKS for me, and doesn\'t seem like excuse-making for a plot device. 

Two of the big problems a lot of us have had with the Virus are: 
1) It\'s ability to "cut new circuts" and
2) the complete and absolute ineffectiveness of Imperial computer 
   defenses.  

How about if the Virus is psionic?  Not the broad-band variety 
of psionics that humans have (though that could certainly be 
a plot point for some exotic strains), but a limited, highly 
specialized ability akin to Zhodani "flicking".

It uses this to physically alter the hardware it is inhabiting 
to create defenses against the usual viral countermeasures.
Even at tech 15-16, with self-reconfiguring organic computers or 
what have you, computer virii boil down to being either hardware 
critters (in which case they can\'t transfer to other machines) 
or software critters (in which case they can, ultimately, be 
DELETE-ed). Standard computer defenses revolved around isolating 
the nature of a virus (lower case), cornering it, and eliminating 
it. 

Enter the Virus (upper case), an electronic life form that through 
its psionic abilities can break the hardware-software barrier, and 
can convert from one to another almost at will.  Imperial scientists 
never gave much thought to psionic electronics, except for some 
Ancients scholars, and it was a matter of debate among even them.  
And besides, that was the ANCIENTS, not US. 

What you wind up with is the Virus acting pretty much as GDW 
describes it.  The Virus is so effective precisely because it 
ovecomes a barrier that was considered so fundamentally absolute 
that its breaching was never taken into account, kind of like the 
way the real world doesn\'t take Traveller-style psionics into 
account-- they simply don\'t exist until someone (or thing) shows 
up to prove otherwise.


At any rate, this gives me a rational handle on the Virus, rather 
than leaving me hemming-and-hawing about its super-duper 
effectiveness and circut-cutting.  Your milage may vary.

Actually, not in the Regency.  If you look at the data for Regina
subsector in the TNE rulebook, and compare it to older sector data,
you may notice that tech levels in the area have been *increasing*
since 1105.  As I recall, in 1201 Regina/Regina is tech 13, but in
1105 I think it was only tech 10.  I think during the Rebellion-era
it was about tech 12, according to the sector data.  And no, it isn\'t
the only world in the area to go up.  (Also note that they\'ve been
expanding the old X-boat network to run along the border with the
Extents.)

It seems to me that the Spinward Marches economy was primarily geared
to trade "behind the claw" (i.e. internal to the Regency) even before
the Rebellion.  The area was one of the Imperium\'s primary commercial
regions to begin with, partly due to the continuing development of the
area, and partly due to the fact that the Windhorn-Great Rift corridor
makes long-range traffic with the main body of the Imperium so time-
consuming.  After the closing of Corridor, the worlds in the area
had to re-tool to pick up the slack of the few industrial materials they
needed that come from the Domain of Vland or further away.

The text in the TNE rulebook says that the Regency economy is 
"overheating".  This suggests that the main problem the Regency
is facing economically is not lack of production or technical
development, but rising inflation rates.  You might have to pay
higher interest on a new Far Trader loan because of that, so
some traders would put off the purchase for a while...you can see
how that might begin to stagnate the Regency economy, even though
it is *incredibly* healthy by standards of the Wilds.

I think that there are a number of worlds which conceivably might
have achieved TL16 since the Rebellion.  Mora is a candidate, as
capital and commercial hub of the Regency.  Some of the older
worlds near the Regency hub in Deneb may also fit.  High population
worlds at TL15, starport A, and near Mora or another major commercial
region, and on an X-boat route, would be places to expect it.

(By the way, people might ask why the Regency hasn\'t been expanding
 heavily into Foreven.  Well, the Zhodani provincial capital for the
 Regency area is in Foreven (roughly equivalent to a domain capital --
 this is where the government on Chronor gets its orders from!) 
 Most likely, they consider the sector as part of their "sphere of
 influence" and dislike rival governments meddling in local affairs,
 even though they only control a third of the sector.  Remember,
 it was Imperial-sponsored colonization in the area in the 500s that 
 triggered the First Frontier War!  This is another good reason 
 besides the drain on resources due to anti-Virus patrols why the
 Regency hasn\'t been growing quickly to spinward.  Neither the
 Zhodani nor the Regency want to get in a war over something which
 isn\'t a high priority for either government.)

Hi,


I am wondering if any of the FTP sites have sector information on sectors 
located outside charted Imperial space. I\'m interested in all the areas 
(Zhodani Consulate, Vargr States, Aslan Hierate (sp?), Hiver Federation, 
and the K\'Kree whatchamacallit). So if anyone has information, I\'d 
appreciate it very much as I\'m trying to update all my sectors and come 
up with a big map of who\'s where and who owns how much. Thanks in advance.

about work.  Then, after I got back to school, I had too much work to post
this.  
	Anyway, back to important things

In response to rodge@cyberspace.com (from sometime week-before last):

	Not necessarily.  This was a particular case where the player had been 
involved from the beginning, and I wanted him to be there when his    
character was \'retired.\'  Besides, it allowed us to use the our valuable
gaming time ( we have 2 ugrads, 1 PhD candidate, 1 CPA, and 1 soon-to-be
policeman) to branch out to other games (Star Wars and CoC).

	Since the deleivery of the message to Esalin marks an endpoint to the
beginning of the campaign, I wanted Bella ( what Helen is called by her
friends) to be there when her character decided to go back home (somewhere
in Corridor sector) on one of Marcus\' traders.  She\'s currently 1st officer 
on the MV DeLancian Dream.

>By the way, what happened to the characters on Wednesday?  
	Ah, a small sidebar has open up in the adventures of this intrepid band
of characters.
	After delivering the mail to Esalin ( and the departure of Bella), the
characters decide to head back into the sector to more \'safe\' areas (right).
They jump toward Lysen.
	Therefore, introduce new PC- Shea. (This sidebar was developed to get
Shea in with the adventures.  She will become a regular on our show.)
	Shea has a problem - the Malithar (basically the Mafia) want her dead.
Why?  She KNOWS something that could break their little drug distibution
ring wide open.
	(The idea for this comes from an old StarFrontiers module _Drammune Run_.
	not a *bad* adventure, but the core idea was great.)
	The planet Shea comes from (Margesi 1020 SpMa) has had a bit of trouble
lately with one of their colonies.  One of the other small planets
has developed a very open, frontier-like mentality that, unfortunately,
also allows it to be used as a refuge for people who would rather not be
found.  This Mars-like planet, Qinzeno, is the base for the Malathar.
	The Malathar are marketing a drug (called hyperdrive on the street) that
allows the brain to experience, in a small way, the swirling energies of
jumpspace (it boosts the psi-centers of the brain).  However, repeated uses
of the drug makes the user decend into a heavy jump-sickness like state
before they eventually die of brain failure.

Name: Shea Anton-Penanza
Race: Imperial     
UPP: 154EF7
Age: 70( 70)
BirthDate: 056-1046
Career: Merchant
	For the last 54 years, Shea has roamed the Marches from spinward to 
trailward, from corward to edgeward, seeing almost every planet along 
the way.   She learned her trade almost too well, making enough money 
top buy the freighter from her captain and mentor when he retired.  With 
a ship of her own, she truly felt fulfilled.
	That\'s when the bug hit her.
	The disease has been named Pneumonomutiexosiliconiosis, a viral 
infection that eventually destroys the lungs.  Unknown in its origin, it 
especially hits those people who move from planet to planet, exposing their 
immune system to the dangers of a thousand worlds.  This exposure forces 
the immune system into overdrive, and Pneumono is a very opportunistic bug.
	(btw- if anyone with better medical skill can suggest of a better name,   
	it would be appreciated.)
	Although it takes several years to develop, there is no known cure. The 
best that can be done is to stay on one planet, not taxing your immune 
system any more.  With this diagnosis, Shea continued her way, travelling 
about the stars, until it bacame too much.  After twenty years with the 
bug, Shea decided to retire and return to Margesi(notice her low STR & END).
	One last run, Shea thought, carrying foodstuff from Margesi to Qinzeno, 
wouldn\'t kill her.  Besides, she could sell the ship on Qinzeno for a larger 
profit than on Margesi, even after paying for passage back home.
	Unfortunately, it all went wrong.  When unloading the cargo from the 
ship, one of the smaller crates broke open, revealing its contents.  
Inside was two animals, with furr coats, curled up about themselves.  
Although whole animals are often shipped becausse of their values as 
delicacies, these were not food animals, nor were they dead.  They were 
very much alive.
	The chukka are as close to a planetary mascot the Margesi have.  These 
small, ferret-like animals are incredibly intelligent, cute, cuddly, and 
friendly.  Exporting them off Margesi is also a capital crime.  The Imperial 
Scout Service declared chukka as proto-intelligent, meaning they could, 
given a few million years, develop true intelligence.  If the poulace of  
Margesi knew chukkas were being exported to Qinzeno, it would create
an interplanetary incident.  As proto-intelligents, chukkas could not be 
removed from their native planet.  Why would anyone want to steal these 
animals?  After hiding the chukkas on her ship, Shea tried to find out.
	A miner with a tongue loosened with drink revealed the answer: 
Hyperdrive.
Hyperdrive is made from the pituitary glands of chukkas.   (The chukkas,
though this is not known, are latent psions and can read surface emotions
and attitudes.  This is what makes them so friendly to some, and not so
friendly to others.  The are friendly to most people.)
	Qinzeno has recenlty declared independance from Margesi, and has used
the profits from its mining to hire mercenary forces.  Any small incident 
could plunge the system into war, a war Qinzeno would lose.  The Malathar
doesn\'t want the war to happen.  It would destroy their main operations
base on Qinzeno.
	Shea had to escape.  If the Margesi population knew about the chukka 
being used to make hyperdirve, they would force a conflict with Qinzeno.
	Jumping into her ship, she blasted out from Qinzeno - not even waiting 
for her crew, only to be chased by sleek, black fighter craft.  Someone 
must have overheard her conversation at the bar.  
Someone must have noticed the empty container and the missing chukkas that 
were wrapping themselves around her feet as she flew the ship.  There was no
way she could get to Margesi with the fighters after her.  A small jump, to the
other side of the system would throw the fighters off, then she would try to
come back to tell the Margesians.  Setting her jump destination, she 
powered up the drives.  Right before final tumble, the fighters hit the 
j-drive, fracturing the zhuchai crystals...
The misjump flung her ship across almost thirty parsecs and took almost  six
weeks to complete.  The life support fading, Shea barely survived  her
month-long bout with jump sickness to re emerge into realspace at  Lysen, in
Jewell subsector.  Her ship falling apart, Shea limped the  wounded freighter
into an orbital dock and tried to disappear into the  crowds.  Her ship, the
Discus, she knew, was ruined.  Her j-drives needed complete  replacement, her
thrusters barely responded to her commands.  She had  to find a ship - a fast
ship - to take her and the two chukka ( she has named then Charles and Ada )
back to Margesi.  She had friends there.   Perhaps they would be able to help. 
Pehaps the Malthar are no longer  looking for her...  

Thus, she charters the characters ship to head back to Margesi with just
herself and personal cargo (the chukkas, though the ships crew do not know of
them) and no questions asked.

	What will out intrepid bands of characters do?  Will their passenger
bring them great danger?  Whill Shea entrust the crew with her secret?  Will
they help her against the Malathar?

	Stay tuned- Same Traveller Time, Same Traveller station...

>And what do I tell my players if they ask why that woman has been in
>deep freeze so long?
	She tried to kill Ahz, and succeded in killing twenty innocent people 
instead.  Ahz decided to turn the tables on her, eventually tracked her 
down, and placed her in cold-sleep until such time he could truly inflict
deserving revenge on her (something about blackmarket genetic tinkering, or
something like that...)  Unfortunately, although Ahz doesn\'t know this, 
she is *also* an agent for the Malathar...

	Ah, the net closes ever so slightly around the characters...

Hi All,
Regarding the Regency in the New Era:

From my last post (which apparently only saw limited release, I didn\'t
even get a copy):

>>I would like to see how the other races have fared since the collapse.
>>I would think that the Vargr would have been decimated and that the
>>Zhodani would be mostly unharmed. The Aslan behind the claw would...

>Cynthia:

>    Why?  Decimating Vargr is like nailing jello to a wall...

Maybe I should have said scattered or routed. 

I believe that any culture which does not successfully survive and
defeat the first wave of Virus will quickly be reduced to the status
of the Wilds. The Regency survived the initial Virus assault due to
advance warning, astrographic good fortune (easily defendable), deep
resources, and a unified front of resistance. The Vargr may have the
advantage of some warning, but they have a wide border to defend and
no single unifying leader to coordinate the defense. It just doesn\'t 
seem likely that they will successfully resist. On the other hand, 
once all central governement is destroyed, they may be better suited
to recovery than humans.

Maybe my impression of Virus is exaggerated. I expect that it would hit
new territories fast and hard and exploit the chaos which will ensue.

I think this is a problem with the Virus history in general.
Virus is portrayed as a juggernaut which establishes a virtual
stranglehold on all defeated regions. Think of all the extensive
computer resources that are now Virus controlled. We are to believe
it can rewrite hardware. Fighting this thing after it conquers is
going to be TOUGH. 

For this same reason, I don\'t see the RCES as likely heir to the 
Iridium Throne. There is just too much struggle ahead in which every
victory will be paid for dearly. The Regency is much better suited
for this role. FTL communications will be what allows the reclamation
of the Wilds. If it is psionic in nature, Virus won\'t have any defense.
The keys to fighting viruses today are rapid detection and distribution
of information. It should be equally important in TNE.


Bye 

Glenn

b.borich echoed these sentiments as well.

It seems to me that in the high velocity world of interstellar space, the
time it takes to become alert is more than you have once the alarm goes off. 

Modern day planes and some ships have automatic pilots and yet there is (or
at least should be) someone awake at all times to respond to emergencies
right? 

However, my original question dealt with that fact that the design rules
said "minimum bridge crew of 2" yet several ships have a bridge crew of 1.
Based on the response I\'ve been getting, I assume that most have decided
that the design rules are in error and the minimum bridge crew is actually
one. 

I have taken a cue from 2300AD witch states that bridge stations must be
maned 24 hrs. per day. Hence I have decided that the minimum bridge crew can 
indeed be one, but you still need two people to pilot the ship. :) 

BTW, is Star Cruiser for 2300AD still published? If not, does anybody want
to sell me a copy? 

I am glad to see all the information on Starports! Maybe this should be
placed in an faq. I\'m sure the information is much wanted and much asked!

A great image (really), but, remember the *JTAS* article "The Ecology of
Piracy on the Spinward Main"?  Raiders who hit too hard or too often
`bite the hand that feeds them\' by either driving off their `prey\' or
inciting the attention of committed police forces.  The Vargr know this.
Planet-, or even city-killing attacks will be reserved for war time
situations - which take an organized state.  Raiders who are `crazed\'
and just destroying for the sake of destruction still need supplies, ship
maintenance, R&R sites, etc. (again, see the *JTAS* article) which provides
a means for *limited* naval forces to deal with them.

The issue of the American military experience in Vietnam is often brought
up as an example of the `difficulties\' of dealing with guerrilla forces but,
IMHO, erroneously so.  A few nukes, or even heavy conventional air strikes,
into the North Vietnamese supply lines in *China* would have put a quick stop
to Vietcong activities in the South.  Now, you\'re saying, "But the US wasn\'t
willing to escalate to that level."  You\'re absolutely right - but the Viet-
cong weren\'t shelling Los Angeles either.

For most folks in the US, the Vietnam war was a `nuisance\' (if they paid it
any attention at all) - until their sons started coming home in body bags.
Similarly, Vargr corsairs will be a `nusiance\' to the Regency.  If some still
hit hard it will only take limited naval forces (remember Elphinstone
chasing renegades in Regina after the 5FW?) to deal with them.

> In Gvurrdon,

Yes, they could, but these large states have interests that aren\'t
necessarily served by going to war with the Regency.  Considering the inherent
chaos of war the leaders of the larger Vargr states are probably even *more*
reluctant to go to war - the resulting chaos might threaten their very
existence.

>     (3) How do you "foster instability in the Extents"? 

Primairly through arms sales and other `assistance\' to opposing forces.  The
US has been doing an `excellent\' job of this in Latin America for decades.

When one of the Regency\'s clients decides to call the Regent a "hairless,
toothless, clawless puppy" the Regency can continue to supply them with arms
if it serves the Regency\'s ends.  An `insulted\' Vargr leader would be forced
to go to war with her `client\' in order to preserve her charisma - there\'s
your inherent instability.

>  And what nation(s) do you start with?

The `second tier\' states that are envious of the `big dogs\'.  When they get
to be the `big dogs\' you help the next tier - or the former `big dogs\' - *ad
nauseum*.  What do you get?  Ethiopia and Somalia.  Iraq and Iran.  Pakistan
and India.

Jeff Zeitlin made an interesting clarification on Thursday night about
the threat from the *Virus* through the Vargr border.  This makes a great
deal of sense.

Well, is this an opinion or something written in the GDW `stone tablet\'?
My sense is that, after only 70 years, those groups that manage to move
back to the stars are going to be - by and large - descendants of Imperial
culture that somehow managed to lessen the onslaught of the Virus.

Maybe, but after 1000 years of being `homebodies\' and then with the *added*
burden of the Virus assault from `out there\' what could possibly motivate 
such local cultures to venture into space?  I believe this sort of pocket
empire will be the exception rather than the rule.

IMHO, the `typical\' pocket empire world will be a world that enjoyed a
relatively advanced level of technology during the Imperial era but that
also enjoyed a certain degree of isolation from the Imperial mainstream
(to give it an opportunity to blunt the assault of the Virus) and that also
enjoyed a large degree of self-sufficiency (again to blunt the effects of
the Collapse and to support the rebuilding during TNE).  Now, such a world
might not have much of an `Imperial\' cultural heritage but it *still* will
have a *technological* cultural heritage.

I agree on the Revolution and the earlier date but where does the motivation
come to move to democracy?  Remember the Imperial nobility were not just
political leaders but held a great deal of the economic assets as well.
When they cut off the head of the local marquise, who gets her 60% share in
the local agricultural operation?  Distribute it among everyone?  That\'s
`democratic\' but not very efficient.  Give it to the board of directors
of the operation?  Doesn\'t that just make `director\' a new name for `baron\'?
Won\'t this be the trend anyway because most people are *used* to having
`someone else\' make these sorts of decisions?

Think of the American and French Revolutions.  Early on, despite their
assertions and our `rose colored\' views, the early revolutionaries weren\'t
very `democratic\'.  Participation was limited to propertied, white males -
no where near a majority of the total population but pretty nearly a
*totality* of the *economic* interests.  It took decades (and subsequent
civil uprisings, some wars) for those initital ideas of `equality\' to be
expanded to where we are now.

How long ago was the Rim War?  Aren\'t we talking several centuries?  We
don\'t have much of an `aristocratic\' or `monarchic\' tradition here in
North America and yet that\'s a much more recent heritage for us than
`democracy\' is in the Old Expanses.  Admitedly, the American settlers were
`anti-monarchists\' but I doubt many `democrats\' were prominent in Old
Expanses society under the Imperium either.  How come that wonderful 
`assimilation\' is going to work for the Coalition when it apparently hasn\'t
worked for the Imperium?

The Regency doesn\'t (or at least *might* not) know about the Black Curtain.
As far as Norris was concerned a `legitimate\' successor might have appeared
in 1140, 1160 or 1180 and yet this successor might *still* have `problems\'.
Remember it was the lack of `one clear choice\' that led to the Rebellion
and Hard Times in the first place and Norris and the Domain only avoided
becoming embroiled in that mess because they were isolated by the fall of
Corridor.  So maintaining that isolation made sense in the early days.

Well, things seem to keep getting back to that same point: it\'s only been
70 years.  Whatever `democratic\' elements have arisen in the Regency aren\'t
going to be very well entrenched (much less even than in the Coalition).
Remember again, a lot of adults in TNE grew up listening to their grand-
parents telling them about the `good old days\' under Strephon.

I agree.  Norris would.  Seldrian might.  Avery and Seldrian\'s daughter?
Who knows?  Their children?  I doubt it.

As *long* as things are going well.  Look at Russia.

Ahhh, don\'t promote this misconception!  Ask the Software Engineering

Two good points.  The Regency may be able to `disinfect\' the Virus but
it may be less sure of fighting the Ziru Sirka, Lucan\'s Imperium or
Dulinor.  (Remember, the Regency may not have the NE map of the Imperium.)

Have I really been `holding forth in ignorance\' for `a good deal of time

This is true, but then a Coalition under these sorts of conditions isn\'t
very centralized or stable, which means it\'s not very effective, which
leads to questions like, "The *what* Coalition?"  :-)

In the same post you quoted me from above I wrote:

much because GDW hasn\'t weighed in yet with a sourcebook.  If this is how

I like this idea.  It `resonates\' well with the incorporation the Aslan

	Although many diverse are the pleasures of the 3rd Imperium
perhaps one of the broadest, particularly for spaces, is that of the
arcades. Of those born to space or at least the stations can they not
remember those long hours of lost youth spent in the arcades? The loud
music, the crowd, and the stunning new games. And what percentage of
us that were there were drawn into the travelling space professions in
hopes that we might berth some day on Serabi, producer to so many of
those games?
	One can hardly mention arcade games without thinking almost
synomously of the RealVision and Red Wizard trademarks. The former is
the trademark for the most widely circulated arcade periferials and
the later the giant in the Arcade Software industry. The standards
both of them use define the marketplace even for third party hardware
and software. Both, in fact, can be considered one company as they are
jointly managed by the enigmatic figure of "The Red Wizard" who lives
almost as much in legend as reality (virtual or otherwise).
	The RealVision hardware ranges from the simplistic 3D imaging
found on most home systems to the full stim-tanks in the arcades. Most
commonly it is found as a combination of simple gogles and grav-sticks.
	The goggles are light-tight and provide for full 360 degree
simulated vision. Advanced pairs come with cameras so that their user
can flick back to check on reality at a moment\'s notice with no extra
inconvienence. These also serve to monitor the rest of the body\'s 
movements so that the simulation can correctly pose its analogue.
Goggles without this feature have to rely on external shipboard cameras
and approximation algorithym. Although the difference is hard to
detect most long-term arcaders prefer the inbuild system.
	[It isn\'t a widely know fact but the military FullVision system
is, in fact, a anonymous spinoff from RealVision. In this system each
soldier has integral goggles and a camera, the input of which is
corelated by one person carrying a battle computer in the unit. The
input from all units is conjoined and made available to each person.
Thus one unit could "see through" a wall if the other side was in
view by someone else. Images are stored and slowly faded so that a
quick reconisense fills in the gaps for the whole unit. Nothing
like this is available in their games, though and they usually don\'t
comment on their relationship with FullVision.]
	A grav-stick in its simplest form is a textured baton with
a variety of grips. The mechanism within it has the ability to
interact with the artificial gravity system present on most ships
and stations under computer control to provide appropriate feedback.
	The standard "two sticks and goggles" setup kit can provide
for quite a wide variety of software. They are most widely used for
3rd party educational/entertainment software for training in the
space tight conditions of a ship or station. The obvious examples
are the gymnastic ones with uneven bars, parallel bars, weight lifting,
etc. Although with enablement into the system of the area\'s grav plates
and inertial compensation one can find fairly good skiing, tennis,
shooting, and many other packages available. More exotic grav-balls,
and grav-seats allow for other packages like bowls or driving instructors.
	This leads back into the software realm. Red Wizard is the
trademark of the largest arcade software company. They are based on
Serabi station and are best known for their extrememly detailed
progressive adventures. The game will usually start with the player
(or players) appearing in the "outfitting" section. They there chose
amongst the various allowable implements they might use in completing
the rest of the adventure. Once "kitted out" they move into the adventure
proper. This can be anything from a 10 mintue spurt to full blown
week-long excursions. In most arcades "death" or complete failure just
means a return to outfitting and starting over again. If the adventure
is completed or otherwise finished the players procede to the "endgame".
This usually just consists of the credits, where each of the people on
the programming team makes some sort of cameo appearance. The most
notable figure, of course, is The Red Wizard himself. In these, no matter
what the genre, he always appears as a ingratitingly cheerful red-robed
wizard seemingly immune to all antagonism (but see later).
	The normal Red Wizard release takes a team of up to 30 designers
9 months to produce. They are the most advanced in the industry in
design software and quality control. They have a very aggressive bug
control policy and offer free software to anyone who can find a bug.
	So in this virtually limitless arena what are the rules? Some
companys have none and truly anything can happen. The Red Wizard himself
has personally derided such companies in their literature instead
garunteeing their customers a consistent genre reality. Within any of
their supported genres (which range from Historical Romance, Fantasy,
to Modern, Vaudville and a plethora of others) players are garunteed that
everything will work consistantly. They have synthesised for each what
they call "The Laws of Reality" which are available to the trade for
designing compatible games. This allows players who have gained special
items or treasures as the results of one game can carry these on to another.
	Anything the players can meet must be constructed according to
the Laws of Reality. Even the Red Wizard analogue at the end of most games
is designed that way. There is always one way to "kill" the irritating
character. Often players will play the game not for the purpose of whatever
inbuilt goal there is but for finding the secret way of offing the Wizard
at the end.
	The exciting aspect of this commonality is that there is a subset
on a cross-genre level that are common. This enables the yearly "critter
competition" on Serabi. In this the top four selling games are conjoined
together. Interface software converts the subsystems of one genre to a
compatible level with the others in real-time enabling a great collective
adventure.
	This "Greatest Entertainment Experience" takes place in the
Serabi RealVision Arcade on the Serabi spaceport. The most widely know
and sophisticated arcade in the Dete sector. Their facilities will
support up to 80 players in full stim tanks. These not only provide
full output into the simulation from the players there is also full
bio-feedback from the system to allow nearly full sensory input to
the players. "As good as being there" is what the literature advertises.
Extended excusion holidays are offered where play can extend through
several subjective weeks. For this instance there are bio-support
facilities integral to the tank which make the extended play possible.
Various psyco-medical drugs and effects are used to tune the player\'s
awareness to ignore long repetitive tasks (like sleeping or long jump
journeys) allowing the software to "fast-forward" through boring bits.
In some systems the effect goes so far as to supress recent short term
memory, erasing the decision to take a trip to the arcade. Such jaunts
are reported to be particularly fulfilling as they can be completely
unaware that they are in a simulation.
	There are some people who exhibit an adverse reaction to the
full stim-tanks. RealVision strongly advises that all players take
specific regulated medical tests before engaging in this sort of activity.
This service is provided free of charge on Serabi station.
	But in all of this we have skirted the edge of The Red Wizard
himself. Very few facts are know about him although the arcade community
abounds with a great deal of lore. Some beleive he is just a trademark,
others that he is in fact a recorded personality, and even other that
he is an incarnation of a deity. From the company register, though, it
can be gained that there is, in fact, a real person, registered under
the name of "The Red Wizard" who is the director of both companies. He
is, though, surrounded by a complete media screen and only communicates
occasionally through releases.
	The circumstantial evidence though is sufficiently high to credit
with some additional facts. He seems to be a complete expert on all systems
and apparently is personally responsible for the analogues that have
defeated the ingunity of so many players. Occasionaly this analogue appears
real-time in the critter competition and it is widely beleived that it is
the man himself. So, the only recomendation that we can make to those 
wanting to know more about his is to play the games, and maybe, someday,
you will find him.

Okay, but remember, you asked.

First, I admire the character it took to make the apology, but, I think you
should have rembered the `First Rule of Holes\' and `stopped digging\'.

There was nothing `sexual\' about the encounter you described.  It was violent,
not sexual.  This misperception of violence as `sex\' is part of what leads
to that sort of behavior.

> Not only do

Again, they are not taking advantange of `sexuality\'.  They are taking 
`advantage\' of others whose *violence* manifests itself in `sexual\' activity.

> circumstances (in effect taking advantage of the weakness of men)

To suggest that a prediliction toward sexual violence (the `weakness\' you
describe here) is a characteristic inherent in all men is insulting and
and sexist.

> addition their sense of revengeful satisfaction at the point where they get
> to counter-attack their aggressor is heightened by the slow build-up

More misanthropy and misogyny.  One violent act is `countered\' by resorting
to the `satisfaction\' of another violent act - all under the guise of `sexual\'
activity.  To suggest that one can achieve `satisfaction\' in the aftermath
of a violent, sexual assault through the commission of another violent act
is reprehensible and unconsidered.

And your professional psychological credentials that allow you to make any

I would prefer you choose to keep these views to yourself.  What you and a
group of friends prefer to do `in the privacy of your own home\' is your
business.  What you do on a public forum like this becomes everyone\'s.  You
have the right to continue to express this sort of stuff but you will also
have to bear the responsibility of evoking this sort of response.

> I fully support women and their equal rights

The fact that you see this as only a `women\'s issue\' suggests to me that
you still have some room for improvement in this realm of `enlightenment\'
that you so nobly lay claim to.

> - my own wife has to put up with

No, you have *second-hand* experience.  I encourage you to write an `encounter\'
in which a man faces a similar manifestation of violence in sexual activity.
Please don\'t post it but if you write it honestly I feel you might benefit
from the exercise.

> I don\'t like
> to encourage needless aggression

In my opinion, you original post and this subsequent `rationalization\' do
just this.

Finally, I\'d like to apologize to the TML for this exchange.  I initially
expressed my concerns about Mr. Lilly\'s post in a private message to him.
He, regretably in my view, chose to respond on the TML.  I therefore felt
it necessary to respond in kind.

Let\'s all try to be a little more sensitive to others and get back to having
fun.
