Isn\'t easier to tweak the existing genetic structures, reduce the pig\'s
(or elephant\'s) overall size but increase and airfoil the ear size and
cartilage structures. Add a modified cellulose digesting/methane producing
bacteria to the gut. Then feed liberally on licorice and hay.
The genetech required is only edit-DNA, you are using med(gene)tech with
theory developed at TL7, prototyped at TL8, and viable at TL9.

I haven\'t got a full version of JTAS2 but I\'ve got copies of
the Victoria stuff, and wasn\'t it reprinted in the first "Best of"  ?

What info would you like ?

Question:  Why in the 11,000 worlds would you turn the power plant off?
Most of them are fueled for a full year, and that fuel is topped of when
you refuel.  Captains would probably turn the pant down to a minimal
"housekeeping" level when in port, but why stress the equipment having to
re-fire the chamber?

The only time I could see turning the palnt off is during annual
maintenence.

Features
1xSeat, Restricted

This Lifeboat is designed with one emergency low berth with a capacity for four
passengers or crew members. This lifeboat is intended to be launched from a
jettison bay. There is a single restricted seat for an optional robotic pilot,
however a robotic pilot is not necessary as the lifeboat\'s second computer can
be a specialized computer that will pilot the boat and operate the radio to
send a distress call. It is designed to operate for a full year. However, if
the engines are shut down after the lifeboat gets away from the disabled mother
ship, the reactor can be switched to operate at a minimal level that allows it
to continue operating for over 5 years.

   Has it been stated anywhere that private citizens may own det 
lasers? The IRoW in the Imperial and Regency settings will restrict 
their ownership as always (if the MCr+ a pop pricetag scare 
buyers off).  I suppose private citizens can still get the 
same style missiles that were used in CT/MT, but in TNE it was 
decided those missiles were useless in space combat.

Simple.  I made a ruling that private citizens couldn\'t own det-nukes, and
had to have their lasers tuned in the FUV.

The Supreme Court ruled over fifty years ago that "weapons of mass
destruction" were not covered by the Second Admendant.

The major difference is that I put a 1 ton weapons pod on it. There is
no extra power to operate weapons in the weapons pod. So, it has to be
self contained. If the weapons pod is not used you can take advantage of
the full (unloaded performance) of the design. 

I was not able to design it for 18 MCr without sacrificing the sensors
and communications which I felt was unacceptable. This design costs
20.089 MCr which I feel is pretty close to the Starships version...

Maybe an more archaic design emergency generator is used, perhaps tied

Yes.  I am _still_ awaiting a sign of interest from you-know-who.  

Official contact from IG, or a shareware payment from someone*, will
reactivate my interest (and the software).


* Seeing as IG still has over $80 of my money, I need _some_ way of recouping.

I have a female player in my current Traveller campaign, so there is at least
one more out there :)  In fact, she is an avid role-player and had been in the
TNE campaign I ran a few years back.  Although the highest female/male ratio
for playing came when we were playing the "dark and weird" type games...  Kult
and Vampire.

Well, the CT and MT rules specify that a full load of fuel keeps the power
plant going for a month. The MT rules also give tasks for cold versus hot
starts to the power plant, and state that a cold start is necessary (IIRC)
after a week in port. This seems to imply that it is standard procedure to
power down the ship if you\'re hanging around port longer than a week or so.

Perhaps there is no technical reason why you should have to turn it off. Maybe
it\'s just a case of being standard starport regulations. Maybe citizens at
large starports are nervous about having hundreds of nuclear power plants
active in one location.

What about a rechargeable batter?  This is what cars do today... seems

Like Khan, I am a two-dimensional thinker.  Although in this case, I have more
of a reason then just having a 20th century mind.  Simplicity.  I tend to make
wider sprawling devices rather then build them in 3-dimensions.  Its easier
for me to deal with when drawing on graph paper.

The system I had devised for space stations in my sector of space was this:
There are two different main models (produced by General and Ling).  One
consists of straight segments with artificial gravity generators.  These can
be built into a lattice work.  There are living quarters, bio-bubbles, life
support segments, and generator segments.  There are some variations, but all
will fit into each other.  Slightly more power hungry due to the artificial
gravity, but the ease of linking them together like legos makes it simpler to
use them.  The result of putting these pieces together is a sort of giant
human habitrail, not a solid mass ala DS9 or Babylon 5.

The other form doesn\'t include artificial gravity, and is sold to those
cultures who don\'t have a high-enough tech level to maintain them in the long
run, or to those who don\'t want to spend the extra cash on AG generators and
the extra power needed.  These are curved, and a minimum number are needed to
make a circle, although "dummy" packages are sold to balance the whole thing
out if needed.  Once a circle is complete, additional segments could be added
next to the original segments, making a wider track.  Power and storage are
kept in the center.

The logistics of making a single large station and moving it in a j-tender
just seems best left to the Imperial navy and the big megacorporations.

I do like the Babylon 5 idea of having a low rent district, but which would be
a better idea from the station-owner\'s point of view:  having extra space and
renting it to undesirables who could steal power that is needed for the other
functions of the ship (such as commerce, weapons bays, life support for the
rest of the ship), or removing the segments and selling them to another group
or transferring them to another space station.

Oh, puleeeze! At the risk of sounding strident, Traveller is NOT 1998 with
starships!!! At this point those citizens have been living with small,
often portable fusion power sources for _thousands_ of years. Being
\'Nervous\' about having working fusion plants around would be like us being
\'nervous\' about having all that dangerous electricity in our house on the 
grounds that it might leap out of it\'s wires and strike us when we\'re not 
looking.

More than likely starships are powered down to some minimal level, meaning
you have to \'warm start\' the systems when in port. That would be more
likely due to the owners not wanting the thing stolen. I see a ship with a
full-on power plant as akin to a car with its engine running; on minimal
power akin to a car with the ignition off, and fully shut down like a car
with it\'s battery dead or removed. Each requires a different level of
effort to get the thing moving. Fully shut down would be rare, ordinarily
only done for maintenence reasons.

What else do you come up with when the Engineer throws a spectacular failure?  I
use house rules that reduce the chance of misjump if you get successful taks
resolution from Engineering, Astrogation and Piloting.

 In CT and MT, conventional missiles were the rule.  In TNE (FFS), it was
pointed out that there is a point at which lasers (being speed of light
weapons) acting defensively against significantly slower weapons (missiles) can
guarantee destruction.  This point is a significant distance from the target.

I tend to agree with that position.  Unless you overwhelm a target with a _lot_
of targets or targeting interference, it should not be possible to slip a
missile in past a properly configured defensive posture and achieve skin
contact.

The alternative were laser head missiles (most popularly, the X-ray laser).
These go off quite some distance from the target and pump out lasers in a
variety of directions... in the traveller world they are directed a bit better
than my understanding of physics says is possible!  :)

My take on these missiles is this: Stand off detonation (SOD) missiles are the
standard for space to space combat.  Nuclear (X-Ray) missiles, however, are the
province of the Imperial Navy _only_.  I\'m a firm believer in this being the
line that the Imperium draws with weaponry.  City lifters are the province of
the military and a very, very few mercenary companies.  Civilians can buy SOD
missiles, but they use a chemical laser warhead which only generates 1 beam.
(i.e. 1 point of damage)

(sigh) personally, I liked it in the CT days - if you could get that missile hit
in, it could do up to 6 points of damage - real justification for a merchant to
have at least one missile tube in his turret, even though it cost 25 Kcr a
throw.  In T4, they just don\'t do that kind of damage.

"Running doggo" - presumably even at "warm start" levels the plant puts

Well, heck, a year of fuel is a lot, but who knows - it _could_
run out of fuel. It\'s a saftey thing, or, more likely, a "checklist
item" - no one ever uses it, but you can\'t sell a fusion generator
without one (restart batteries that is).

Which is more than often enough to warrant a mechanism to get the thing
restarted. Imagine all those UPS units for computers out there that
get used maybe once a decade - that kind of peace of mind is a big
thing for a lot of people.

Not as nervous as Isreal is, you can be sure!
  But seriously, the main difference here, is that the "attacks" have not
occurred.  I would be willing to be, that I am not the only GM who has had
to deal with this kind of behavior before...  Wanna bet?
  Essentially put, nuclear warheads in civilian hands would make most
people nervous...  Granted, TNE encourages the mindset that civilization
has crumbled and central authorities are now no longer able to maintain
planetary defenses, but even so, protocols should be emplaced to deal with
the possibility.  One rude and nasty thing an invading planet can pull over
an unsuspecting planet, is to use civilian 
"Q-SHIPS" to start the attack without warning...

There were rules for this...

In the World Builders Handbook, or whatever it was called during MT
rules, by DGP associated several starports with major cities.

This was carried out in Vilani & Vargr.

So a few of Vland\'s major cities each had an A level starport.

I can\'t remember the particulars as my books are at home and I am at work.

Um... I had three up til a couple of months back.  Three women, three
men, and me (a male).  Unfortunately, one of the women had to drop out
of the campaign (family problems), but the other two are still there.
One is ex-Navy, the other is a Battledress trained Marine.  (Course, one
is my wife, and I *met* her playing Traveller)

I find that quite a few women like Traveller, usually more so than a
certain \'standard fantasy game.\'  But, then again, I\'ve never had a
problem with my players using unnecessary violence (I ran a campaign for
two years that had only *one* shot fired from a body pistol).
*Necessary* violence, though, is another thing.

   Well equal opportunity and democratic principles in general don\'t apply to
matters of faith.  By that logic, one could just say that God has no right to
put people in heaven or hell and it should be done by a jury of your peers. :

Because something is male-only wouldn\'t make it bad.  Just as a female-only
orginization wouldn\'t be bad just because of that.  It could be, but isn\'t
necessarily so.   Is it right that the Third Imperium will never support (in
its current form) a non-human as Emperor?  I don\'t think that\'s necessarily
bad.  You being human just might not feel properly represented by an alien
Emperor.  We then get into the humans in funny suits stuff because aliens are
probably...  alien and only understandable by placing human attributes on
them.

I totally agree. I was trying to think of a reason that the MT rules say that, after
a week in port, a cold start is necessary. The task is there; I was just trying to
come up with a good reason for it. The reason I gave above is pretty weak, as you
point out, but I\'m still stumped as to why the cold start is there in the first
place.

Of course, the rule could just be ignored ...

In the 20th century, firing up a nuclear reactor is a big deal, involving a lot of
work. In Traveller times, the opposite must be true, or there wouldn\'t be so many
reactors (i.e. power plants) around. Perhaps Imperial technology allows a quick and
easy cold start.

If so, then cold starts would become routine after a few days in port. Why keep the
engine idling when nobody\'s on board?

Don\'t forget, it is this very first son to the family business, second son
to the church rule that allow the CC to attach most of it\'s wealth.  Second
son goes into the clergy.  First son goes to war and dies childless.  Second
son inherits.  Naturally being a good churchman, he gives the property,
business or whatever he inherits to the church.

Or worse still, is questioned^ by the Inquisition and is found guilty or
dies during interrogation^^.  For the most part, these types of verdicts
(which were actually quite rare) were just, however; there were certain
unscrupulous Inquisitors (Remember the mention of Rogues as a possible
character subset?) who did arrange to have Inquisition on the brothers of
truly pious priests, just to get control of the lands, businesses, etc. they
had.  They usually managed to see to it that certain relatives of their own
(even bastard son\'s) got a very good deal on some of said properties.

Disclaimer: The preceding is a report of historical facts and not an attempt
to defame the Catholic Church, it\'s current leaders or any of it\'s true
adherents anywhere or anytime.

     ^See, I refrained from making a little joke by using the word
"questioned" rather than the phrase "persecuted (excuse me, I mean
prosecuted)".  It was hard, but I didn\'t do it.

No wonder I can\'t find my home town. I never knew there was a Alien

Exactly!  It completely cleared up who was number 1, it didn\'t clear up
what was going on.  ;-> Was it an alligory?  Was it a drug induced
hallusination?  Was it a mental delusion?  Was it a simple cop out by the

Our PBS station is even cheaper than I am.  If they have to pay for
something they are *loath* to do it.  IAC, my fond memories of The Prisoner
(like of the original StarTrek) are probably much better than the reality.

   Which is why when I created Gabreelism I based it on religions of today,
with a few new twists here and there (i.e. beliefs against the creation of
AI).  I didn\'t want anyone getting the idea that any one particular set of
beliefs would ultimately win the day.  The \'canon\' explanation is that
Gabree-el, the founder of Gabreelism, was a member of the Searchers for the
One Faith, a group of religious individuals that existed prior to the
Collapse.  The Searchers believed that all religions had some element of the
ultimate Truth about God (the Divine Being) in them, and that they should
seek out those elements of the Truth so that they might have a better
understanding of Him/Her/It.

   As my wife is Catholic, you won\'t be getting argument from me on the
subject.  Of course I do have my own beliefs on the subject.  :-)

   In a culture where there are very distinct roles for men and women, and
those roles are handed down as a matter of faith (check your logic at the
door stuff), it could happen just as easily outside of Catholicism as within.  

   Turning the example around, you could easily have a society in which the
sacredness of a woman\'s womb (the giver of life to us all), makes women
uniquely qualified to administer the holy sacraments (as the carriers of
said sacred body part).  Thus, it is women who are priests, and while men
can fulfill other roles within the faith, since they lack the sacred womb,
they cannot hope to become a priest themselves.

   In my TNE campaign, we have a female player, Kelli, who plays a Kagukan
that works with the Terran Republic Ministry of Justice.  While she is
married to one of the other players, I don\'t think the males in the group
would turn into blabbering idiots whenever she walked into the room if she
wasn\'t.  She is one of those rare women you can think of as "one of the
guys" even though clearly she is not (and no, she doesn\'t look like
something you\'d have put to sleep at the local animal shelter).

What kind of discount did you take?

A 10% volume discount would bring the cost down to 18 MCr, and a standard
design purchased in mass quantities should receive a nice discount over the
"one-of" price.

And throwing enough missiles, or enough electronics, to overwhelm a target

What was finally decided about the "brilliant pebbles" kinetic kill

well, or do I have that wrong?

An alternative, ob Traveller, is some sort of explosive charge to kickstart
the power cycle.  In my games, I have modified GURPS-style Power Cells that
can provide a jolt of electricity to weapon or power systems.

Absolutely!  

Just like there are all kinds of religious/political/cultural beliefs on
Earth today there should be all kinds of beliefs scattered across Known
Space.  A lot of the fun of Traveller is putting the PC\'s in *different*
environments and having them react. These different environments don\'t
always have to be physical environments, either. Plop your Politically
Correct PC\'s in a Gorish Tech 0 world (personally yuck, but that would
*certainly* be different), in a world where atheism is the rigoriously
enforced belief system, in a world where males are the subserviant gender,
in a world that requires that all citizens to be *truely* gender neutral,
in a world where cannibalism is part of the religion, in a world where
euthenasia...you get the idea.

>Question:  Why in the 11,000 worlds would you turn the power plant off?

I can think of several reasons, some of which involve volentarily shutting
the plant down.  ;->

 1.  Annual maintenance, obviously.
 
 2.  Repair of damage to some subsystem that requires the power plant to
     be down.  Damage could come from,
    
    a. combat
    b. sabatoge
    c. lack of maintenance
    d. a critical failure roll
    
 3.  Emergency shutdowns to prevent the "fusion core" from blowing,
     slagging, exploding, melting-down, or whatever from,

     a. any of the stuff from (2)
     b. bad fuel (maybe you got a load of D2 or T2 in the flow)
     
 4.  Reducing IR/Neutrino signature...and there *are* some valid
     reasons.
 
 5.  Safety, security, and/or regulatory reasons while the ship is
     docked at the UpPort or on the ground at the DownPort.
 
 6.  Maybe your ship has several power plants and only 1 is needed to
     provide "housekeeping" power, so you shut down the rest.  Ok, you
     probably shouldn\'t do that, but see 6...
     
 7.  Some duffus orders the Engineer to shut it down. ;->

This I also agree with, but remember stuff happens.

Dear Mr. Backman:

"Gun Geeks"? Though I diligently ensure to respect 
other peoples beliefs, I would appreciate the same courtesy.

The term "gun geek" implies a very derogatory statement toward persons who 
practice the hobby of firearm collecting. I collect and target shoot
firearms!
I do not consider myself or people like me to be a GEEK! However, to use
your
phrase, we "gun geeks" (and I am acquainted w/a lot of "gun geeks") do not 
feel that the private ownership of nukes, chemical weapons or bio-weapons
is
inherently protected by the U.S Constitution nor is it necessary for the 
defence of a free state. As a matter of fact, we "gun geeks" are pleased to
know,
and confident, that the governments of the world have the only legal
control of these said weapons, and that they take painstaking measures to 
ensure that these weapons remain under state control, and out of the hands 
of less than stable individuals. After all, these weapons make an AK-47
look 
like...an AK-47.

If one cannot keep the discussions to a civil and non-personal level
(remember that the 
world is sharing this \'net), then one is better off leaving their comments
aside. 

And no, though I collect firearms and drive a p/u truck, I do not wear a
dirty ball cap,
masticate chewing tobacco, wear pants with my ass-crack showing nor answer
to the name of "Bubba". Nor do my associates. Thank you.

Best Regards
John Muncy

I have guns, and I\'m a geek, so I guess I *am* a gun geek. Geek
isn\'t a nasty word, either :-P  Geeks rule the world one way or another.
You have a computer, you play RPGs----hell, you\'re a geek, too!
Everybody that reads this is a geek. Geeks of the world unite!

As for the second ammendment, I know CBN weapons are way out of what
a class III license allows) On the other hand the whole point is
to fight back if the gov tries to pull a Saddam on you and gas your
town (the Kurds sure would\'ve loved some heavy weapons, no?). But I
have no delusions that that will happen here any time soon. I\'m
happy to shoot at paper (or cans out in the desert now and again).

Ob Traveller ;-) Consider the militia movement on some backwater
planet... they have automatic slug throwers, even a few explosives
and some light armored ground vehicles. They intend to keep the
TL-15 Imperium from squashing their rights? If they can\'t put up a
real fight they should probably just shoot at paper and not play
make belive, I\'d think (that or try to get some grav tanks and
spacecraft).

\'Pocket Empires\' covers the economic cost and time requirements in a
rather abstract but useful way.  You should probably look there for a
canon basis for further speculation on this topic.

The old 15mm stuff looked out of scale to me (so does almost all
25mm I\'ve ever seen. I prefer figures from models, either 1:72 or
1:48. I prefer 1:72 for the same reason you like 15mm, more room.

The MicroMachines figures from Star Wars (and the military ones as
well) look pretty darn good to me. I like the fact that they don\'t
have giant heads (the typical problem with mini figures in lead is
that they want face detail so they sculpt it bigger (that or all
their sculptors live in the land of big-headed folk).

They work just wonderfully, given that the thruster plate drive is pretty
near to a free energy machine.  Even Heplar-powered devices are somewhat
scary, but if you let them get any serious accel time in, it becomes way,
way out of line.

I have it as canon in my games that thruster plates do not change your
kinetic energy, as they decouple gravitational and inertial mass.  Thus,
they are great for skipping about a system in general, but they cannot
create kinetic kill devices easily.

In the process of redoing the data in FS, I am reconsidering the effects of
TL on trade.

How do the following assumptions sound?

1.  Tech level is the most important determiner of GNP in the game.  A TL
change represents a factor of 2, and a change from 1 to 2 is the same
relative change as 11 to 12.
2. Infrastructure and resources are half as important as TL.
2. Port, gas giants, and belts are half as important as infrastructure
3.  Sylea is a wealthy world in M0.  The average PCGWP of a TL 12 world
with a class C port, average resources, and an average number of gas giants
and asteroid belts is ~10KCr.

To put some context on it, I am assuming that every tech level represents
about 1% of the GNP for roughly 100 years on pure research.  A similar
amount of money would need to be spent on new infrastruture, I suspect, but
I will take that up later.  The Apollo program represented something like
3-4% of our GDP for the period when it was in place.  I explain the four
tech levels that Earth has gone through in this century as some kind of
uplift, as otherwise, Traveller numbers are hard to explain.  :)

Consider the following question.  You are about to purchase a new compact
car, such as a Saturn, Nissan, or Toyota.  You are offered an exact replica
of a Datsun B210 from 1975, or a similar Ford vehicle.  The vehicles you
were thinking of cost roughly $12-15K, while the Datsun cost $3K at the
time.  Inflation would boost that to something closer to $6-7K.

Given that the B210 lacks emissions control, fuel injection, air bags, FM
radios, and a lot of other goodies, would it be worth saving $6k?

When I asked around here, I got responses indicating that those goods were
worth perhaps half of what supposed equivalents were.  For no good reason,
though, I am assigning a value to a shift of one TL of a factor of 2.  I
would also be willing to accept sqrt(2), but it seems to flatten the curve
a lot.

Thus, the full range of tech levels, from 0 to 15 represents a difference
of 32000 in the price of manufactured goods.  I am assuming that a more
"reasonable" difference for two trading partners would be roughly three
tech levels, or a factor of 8.  Sylean goods selling here, would be worth
between 8 and 16 times what they were on Sylea, or, alternatively, we would
have to give up a tremendous amount of stuff to get each F+ plant.

This makes the existence of labels like "Stellar" more sensible - traders
will likely trade within a band, as that band represents the capital they
can amass, and the markets that can afford their goods.  It would be
unlikely for there to be a lot of cross talk between agricultural,
industrial, stellar, and high stellar goods.  when there is, a world, or a
trader becomes very wealthy.

Consider - under normal circumstances, a trader cannot carry off enough
wheat to justify a single fusion plus unit, so they likely do not get any
buyers at all at the "real" price of 4000 times what they paid.  Instead,
the locals might put together a hundred people\'s work to buy the unit.  The
trader might have been better off hauling off fine machined goods from a
different high tech world to the asteroid colony that made the fusion plus
plant.  If the asteroid world has a disaster and the hydroponics tanks go
deal, then they might suddenly be willing to pay far, far more for that
wheat than one would at first think, and a trader with a cargo of wheat
might be able to swap it for an entire hold of fusion plus units.

Does this sound reasonable?  It seems like the only way to explain the
tremendously slow creep of tech levels, such that there are still
substantial tech level differences in the 1100 era.  In addition, it
explains why so few colonies worked out.  They did not have sufficient
wealth to set up the infrastructure they needed.

I am also assigning life ratings, which run from 0-10 with bonuses.

Resources run from 0-10, and a world with TL 8 and a class D port can add
in half the belts and gas giants, making the maximum rating 12.5.  Is is
reasonable for a single world to have 32 times the recoverable resources of
another?  Can space based industry multiply that by a factor of ~6?
Charles Sheffield thinks so, and I believe him.

A world with no resources at all would be 32 times less productive than the
average of 5, and one with a rating of 10 would be 32 times more so.  Since
you get an automatic boost from that class D port, there is a strong
incentive to construct one. A class B port might make more sense, as if you
cannot construct the craft needed to deal with those extra planetary
resources, it is hard to make money from them.  Alternatively, even class C
ports might be able to make <100 ton small craft.  Opinions?

Roughly 28 percent of all worlds are rich, and roughly 28 percent are poor,
so resources above 6 leads to the Ri trade code, and resources below 4 lead
to the Po trade code.  It is very expensive to raise infrastructure, thus
most people leave it at the average of five or so.

Infrastructure ratings run from 0-10.  Port bonuses range from 0 to 2.5.
This makes the total range of industry about a factor of 75 at any given
tech level.  Any infrastructure over the planetary resource level
represents space based industry and off world trade.

Roughly 28 percent of all worlds are industrial, and roughly 28 percent are
non industrial, so infrastructure above 6 leads to the In trade code, and
infrastructure below 4 lead to the Ni trade code.  It is very expensive to
raise infrastructure, thus most people leave it at the average of five or so.

Because it is difficult to bring in much more trade form off world than a
world generates internally, it\'s infrastructure rating is virtually always
less than or equal to the resources+half the number of gas giants+half the
number of planetary belts.  This is raw infrastructure, and does not
include the port bonus.  (It is a rare industrial world that is poor under
this system, as it is rare for a system to have more than three belts and
two gas giants.)

I am figuring that a raise in tech level represents the information needed,
plus the training and planning needed to fold it in  Since an uplift
already has the information, it costs half as much, and can be done in far
less time.  Repurchasing some fraction of the infrastructure is also
needed, and I am open to argument on how much, but it might make sense to
make a raise in infrastructure cost roughly half that of a raise in tech
level, and a raise in tech level implies the same amount to be spent again
to represent retooling.

By definition, the PCGNP of a world at TL 12, inf 5, res 5, with a class C
port, one gas giant, and one planetary belt is 10KCr.

The port code in all of my formulas comes from
Class	Values
A	5
B	4
C	3
D	2
E	1
X	0

I have tried a lot of different formulas, and gotten a number of different
results.  Fiddling with the parameters for total GWP gives me a couple of
different possibilities, of which the best so far is

GWP=18*2^(4*TL+2*Inf+2*Res+ports+belts+giants)/8

So, to summarize:

Tech level is twice as important as infrastructure or resources.

Port, belts, gas giants are half as important.

One step in TL represents a change of 2.

Some results:

A virgin colony world with no technology
t0 i0 r5 p0 b0 g0 = 18*2^10/8=5*2^1.25 = 43

A virgin colony world for a TL 5 colony
t5 i5 r5 p0 b0 g0 = 242

A virgin colony world for an under funded TL 9 colony
t9 i0 r5 p0 b0 g0 = 18*2^46/8= 969

The average TL 9 world with a C class port:
t9 i5 r5 p3 b1 g1 = 18*2^61/8=3553

A promising TL 12 very rich colony, with a class C port
t12 i0 r10 p3 b1 g1 = 10,050

The average TL 12 world:
t12 i5 r5 p3 b1 g1 = 10,050

Sylea, a rich world in my game:
t12 i8 r8 p5 b1 g2 = 36,864

Shudusham, a populous but not rich or industrial world in my game
t12 i6 r6 p5 b1 g2 = 18,432

A rich industrial world:
t12 i7 r7 p5 b1 g2 = 26,067

The average TL 15 world with a class B port:
t15 i5 r5 p3 b1 g1 = 30,999

Keshi, a very rich world in my game:
t12 i6 r10 p5 b1 g2 = 36,864

Archona, a villainous rich industrial world in my game:
t12 i10 r10 p5 b3 g2 = 87,678

Sylea in 1100:
t15 i8 r8 p5 b1 g2 = 104,267

Everyone\'s worst nightmare - Magrathea:
t17 i10, r10 p5 b3 g2 = 495,981

So, it turns out that by TL 15, even the average worlds are ahead of Sylea
in M0, while high tech truly rules the Imperium.  This also means that it
is unlikely for someone to make a lot of money trading high to low, because
of the currency exchanges, but if they _do_ hit a big fad on an industrial
rich world, the amount of money available is astonishing.

	Well any religion has its drugs, and catholic start drinking wine
	with 14, or even earlier, while moslems are inhaling mariuana, and
	american indians eat fungies and smoke tobako by tradition. Now
	taking a drug is a skill, e.g. I\'m drunken at 2 german beers, but
	can smoke about 10 gram weed over the day. My dog is eating chocolate,
	and I know that you need more polamedon for a junk to avoid turkey,
	than the letal dosis for a beginer.

	ObTrav: I would call drug usage it a skill based on CON. It can
	even have its important applications in a game, thing about a
	planet with TL:3 inhabitants being on your trade route. Now its
	tradition that bussiness is always enabled by some kind of social
	event, and of course (insert prefered drug here) takes an important
	role in that event. e.g. a broker/wheeler who wants to make bussiness
	with this planet, must learn how to smoke tobako if it is american
	indian tradition, or has to drink beer if it has german solomani
	settlement. The skill is used for enabling other skills.

	e.g. riding graph bike after 2 beer
		- hasardous routine alcohol + average driving
	     making bussiness on extasy
	     	- faitfull formidable psidrug + average broker

Dear Mr. Backman:

"Gun Geeks"? Though I diligently ensure to respect 
other peoples beliefs, I would appreciate the same courtesy.

The term "gun geek" implies a very derogatory statement toward persons who 
practice the hobby of firearm collecting. I collect and target shoot firearms!
I do not consider myself or people like me to be a GEEK! However, to use your
phrase, we "gun geeks" (and I am acquainted w/a lot of "gun geeks") do not 
feel that the private ownership of nukes, chemical weapons or bio-weapons is
inherently protected by the U.S Constitution nor is it necessary for the 
defence of a free state. As a matter of fact, we "gun geeks" are pleased to know,
and confident, that the governments of the world have the only legal
control of these said weapons, and that they take painstaking measures to 
ensure that these weapons remain under state control, and out of the hands 
of less than stable individuals. After all, these weapons make an AK-47 look 
like...an AK-47.

If one cannot keep the discussions to a civil and non-personal level (remember that the 
world is sharing this \'net), then one is better off leaving their comments
aside. 

And no, though I collect firearms and drive a p/u truck, I do not wear a dirty ball cap,
masticate chewing tobacco, wear pants with my ass-crack showing nor answer
to the name of "Bubba". Nor do my associates. Thank you.

Best Regards
John Muncy

John, or Mr. Muncy, if you prefer,
I do, (except for the pants and tabacco, I\'ve had the same ball cap for 6
years, designed the logo myself, covered with pins from the various places
I\'ve been sent to in the states and overseas, I love that thing and won\'t
let the wife clean it. It now rests in a place of honor on my desk! Call one
of my co-workers and about everyone else "bubba", have a p/u that costs more
than my son\'s Beamer, and has a gunrack in the back window! Guess I\'m just a
a "REDNECK Piney"* at heart) except when they make me wear a suit!  John,
lighten up. This list generates enough flame wars without one starting over
a term that was obviously, even at a casual glance, meant in jest.

Nope, you have that exactly backwards, the HEPlaR is a controlled plasma

I can\'t believe that you would actually insist on reason in religion.  Many
(perhaps most) religions are not the least bit reasonable or based in the
slightest on reason.

Those of you getting irate right about now, I\'m not talking about your
religion.  I know, you belong to one of the ones that are completely
reasonable and value and practice reason as often as possible.  Me too!  I\'m
talking about those wacky ones, you know.

My point is that

1.) Tradition in many religious organizations is sufficient justification
      for just about anything.
     "We have always done it that way.  I guess we always will."
     I will never forget a discussion I was in regarding modern translations
of
     the Bible.  One of the participants, a very dear and pig-headed
     friend of mine, said, "Why change, the KJV has been working
     just fine for the last 400 years."  I heard of someone else who
     said, "It\'s the Authorized version."  No offense, but who
     authorized it anyway?  (FYI: it was King James (I of England)
     (aka James VI, king of Scotland).)
2.)  People resist change.  It scares them.
     "Better the devil you know."

>...I do wonder how you would defend the idea of a male-only clergy for the

welcome any

I can just hear a parish priest or convent school teacher (nun) explaining
the situation to an inquisitive parishioner or student, something like this:

Christ\'s vicar, His Holiness Pope Pius XCIX, speaking ex cathedra explained
the situation.  He has instructed us that only men, may serve in the office
of a priest.  Women are excluded because they are daughters of Eve, who
succumbed to the temptations of the Evil One and who dragged Adam into
iniquity with her.  Further, it is a well known fact that only a priest may
be elevated to the Bishopric, and only a Bishop may be elevated to the
Cardinalcy, and only a Cardinal may be elected to fill the Papacy.
Therefore, there will never be a woman Pope, Cardinal or Bishop.  Besides if
a woman were allowed to be elected to the Papacy then it would have to be a
Mamacy, and who wants that?

[more deleted]

Not to put to fine a point on it, chill out.

After reading a whole series of articles on gearheads, and how they are (in
some people\'s minds) ruining the game for everyone, and how the catholic
church better/better not allow female cardinals, being called a gun geek is
par for the course.  Since I suspect it was meant with about the same level
of respect as the usual run of posts exhibits towards a lot of other deeply
and sincerely held beliefs, the casual reference seems "in the pack."

As an aside, I happen to hold the opinion that the intent of said amendment
imples the possession of strategic weapons by individual states.  Given how
close the individual states were at the time to the powerful landowners and
thier tenants, I would have to say that weapons of strategic importance
were protected under the original intent of the amendment.

We live in a different world nowadays, where such a strategic weapons can
impact a lot more people than a body of troops with muskets and some wodden
hulled sailing vessels, thus it is appropriate to interpret it n light of
the modern era.  How you scale it to the present day is a matter of debate,
such that some hold that surrendering all handguns in this country would be
a great idea, to those who hold that automatic weapons and grenades are
needed.

Personally, I am of the "if you can use it, can demonstrate that you can
use it, are not a menace, and are willing to be cmpletely responsible for
all results coming from your owning that tool, then go right ahead" school.
I use the same deal on cars, computers, buoldings, and darn near everything
else, which puts me strongly in opposition to the current litigous world.
So be it.

ObTrav - this is how my Imperium runs.  They only pull away nukes because
of the very real chance that those could turn nobody political
organizations into somebody political organizations.  It is cheaper to
forbid and inspect than to give away nuke dampers.

Nope.  My girlfriend plays in my current Traveller game, and I have rarely
had a group without 1-3 female players.  This covers a time period reaching

The first thing I\'d do on a fighter, then, is rip out the storage bank
and let the carrier fire them up.  This would save on mass, which is
critical in a fighter.  There are probably other kinds of ships which
would do this, too.

   Certainly they would run the spectrum, and not every organization
will be cloned from your own belief structure (nor should it). 
Traveller already has its own semi-humorous religion based on the
teachings of St. Elvis (Presley that is).

   I would say however that if you have a situation where a particular
religion or sect is going to be central to a story, it\'s a good idea if
that religion at least partially reflect your beliefs.

   Why?  Well for starters, referees are not necessarily good actors. 
Chances are during a role-playing session you\'re going to have to play
the part of a priest/shaman/etc. from that religion, and it helps your
ability to improvise out the scene if you have a feel for how they
should react to a given situation or set of stimulus.  For example, it
is unlikely that a priest who\'s faith believes in strict pacifism is
going to pick up a gun and start shooting at bad guys, even if a group
of PCs\' lives are in danger (he may shoot into the air to scare off the
assailants).

   Ultimately the basic tenants of Gabreelism reflect a great deal of my
thinking with regard to God, the Universe, and Everything.  It couldn\'t
be helped actually--because when you are writing *anything*, some you
goes on that paper, and it is particularly true when you talk at length
about something as personal as religion.  The same is true when you
create a detailed world government for a campaign.  If you are at all
passionate about politics, some of your belief structures about how you
think government should work (or not work if the government is supposed
to be the bad guys) will be reflected in it.

   The key to writing about passionate subjects is to try to keep as
open a mind as possible to other possibilities (a universe in which all
the governments are democratic republics would be just as boring as one
where all governments were tyrannical and there was no resistance
movement), and remember that just because you feel that a certain way of
life is obvious, it may not be so obvious to someone else.

Harold

Religious belief isn\'t based, primarily, on reason anyway, it is based on
faith, faith in the unreasonable, unprovable, *illuminated* truth.  The
believer, believes *in spite* of any evidence of reason...or so I\'m told.

Bah! My Traveller-*playing* experience dates back to the late \'80s and a
group composed entirely of... um, well, all the regulars were either female
by biology or by adopted gender.  Most of us played characters who were of
opposite birth sex, interestingly enough, i.e., the folks with XX
chromosomes played male characters, the one with XY played a female
character.  Except for yours truly, who played a Hiver; make of it what you
will.

There were great lashings of ultra-violence, ISTR.  Necessary, unnecessary,
shmecessary.  But yeah, there were a lot of ex-Marines with us, too.  This
was about the time _Aliens_ (and <swoon> Private Vasquez) came out, after
all.  Take the aftermath of an encounter with some inadequately-armed
Chirpers: "Hey! Tastes just like chicken!".

Pocket Empires has some numbers in it, together with what supporting
infrastructure and technology they need. They are costed in Resource Units
or RU and are ungodly expensive, when you consider 1 RU = MCr 5000 or so.

Personally, I think the way to go is to have different sizes of starports
(eg class C6 means a class C facility for a pop 6 population), and if your
pop goes up then the class degrades (eg you have a C6 facility, and your
world is now pop 7. Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a class
D7 facility. Please recalculate your economy to cope with the lower level
of starport). Starport costs are based on a log scale, based on size of
facility.

I\'m eyeballing this for FFS2. OK, MCr 2.5 of t-plates, 3 workstations, one
bunk, 5 4 person emergency low berths, a small power plant using The
Abomonation Known As Fusion Plus to run the t-plates and keep the
passengers nicely chilled ... I reckon you could cut the cost and fit in
more than 20 frozen passengers, given 20 dtons to play with. Add a 1m3
fission plant with 2 years fuel supply and a set of auxilary solar panels
(perhaps retractable) and you could conceivably keep the corpsicles chilled
for years. Oh yeah, and a nice strong radio communicator. And maybe a Meosn
Gun. You can never be too careful.

If you buy the Famile Spofulam version, we\'ll throw in a free set of either
a MagaBoing Grav Pogo Stick or a Barbie\'s Own Purse Size Particle
Accelerator Pistol for each of the kiddies.

Kinetic energy is a result of vector and mass.

Thruster plates change vector (even if simply used for skipping 
around the system).

How can a change in vector not change the KE potental of an object? 
Unless 1) the mass goes down, 2) vector is not changed (al la jump).

My way around that is to limit the size of a thruster plate ;)

As far as the demons, devils, daemons and demodands thing goes, that\'s cool.
The new names didn\'t bother me (in fact, they were a little more clear cut.
Daemon is pronounced more or less like demon and the whole thing could get
pretty confusing).

I didn\'t mind the new names, but I did mind the _reason_ for the new names.
Pressure from parents, community and church groups.  I can also understand it.
Why stick to your guns and be poor, when you can change something that\'s
really relatively minor and deflect criticism.

Alcohol in AD&D should best be roleplayed.  Using tables and rules for such a
thing is really silly, IMHO.  Sex in AD&D...  Well, just leave it out.  We
don\'t need the harlot encounter tables ("You meet a brazen strumpet and a
wanton trollop.  What do you do?"), and I think sex area should be tread with
delicate feet...  Doesn\'t need to be in the rule books at any rate...

I know that from the information you have, you can determine the general
class of stars the one in question falls into.  I have attached a
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.  If you have the surface area, the diameter (d)
or radius (r) can be derived using the following formula #1.  Using this
value, you can derive the volume (v) using formula #2.  With the volume, you
can estimate the mass (m) using the estimated density (e) for the type of
star in question.

1.)  d = (a / pi) ^ (1 / 2)                        r = (a / 4 / pi) ^ (1 /
2)
2.)  v = pi / 6 * d ^ 3                             v = 4 / 3 * pi * r ^ 3
3.)  m = v * e

I can\'t find the reference to stellar densities.  If I run across it, I\'ll
post it later.

Hang on there Bruce, there probably would be places where just such
attitudes would pertain.  After sliding down to tech ? and building back up,
what would the difference be?  Or maybe there\'s a government or
revolutionary or religious or business (or a ..., well, you get the idea)
group scaring the people.

This wouldn\'t be everywhere, but there might be a place or two, or even a
whole pocket empire.

That sounds reasonable.  But, don\'t forget about sabotage. ;-)  What a nasty
way to strand your adventurers.  Someone over-rides the generator, not to
blow it up or anything like that, but just to shut it down, and cross
connects the battery to the main grid.  Power plant goes down, batteries
drain, the ship goes dead.

"Oh my god Captain, I can\'t restart it.  We\'re all going to die!"

Maybe a potential or rejected patron would have someone do the sabotage,
just so the adventurers will have to deal with him or her (again if rejected
previously).  Hmmm...

I don\'t understand the problem.  A life boat is not a ship.  It\'s not even

(The Anglican Communion, including the Protestant Episcopal Church of
America, believes in basing its thought and practice on an equal tripod of
Reason, Tradition, and Scripture.  They balance each other out fairly
well, for the most part, though church politics are looking a bit
schismatic at present.  I hate to think what maintaining doctrinal

This assumes that the missiles can be detected and tracked at an adequate
range. If you don\'t notice them before their high velocity and 12G
maneuvers get in too close...

True, but there are counters for laser fire as well, and sandcasters are
more efficient at picking off long range laser fire than close range
missile "hits."

Seems to me they would work, but at longer ranges they\'d still have to
maneuver to their targets, which in my eyes make them cheap missiles
without a warhead.

I WISH they were still making decent 15mm minis, but I\'m afraid that

They do what guerilla movements have done forever...needle the Impies
until they either get real nasty, preferably in front of some well
regarded and placed journalists who can let all the bleeding hearts back
in Core how badly these poor people are being treated, or they make deals
with the Imperium\'s enemies. (Ine Givar, anyone??)

Of course, if there aren\'t any bleeding hearts back in Core, the Imperium
gets to be a brutal nasty place to be, because it\'s clear from Milieu Zero
that the Imperium was founded on the nastiest excesses of
the-ends-justify-the-means Imperialism we\'ve ever seen. (The Zhunastu
rules of contact are pure Machiavelli) The rich get richer, the poor get
poorer, and soon the Imperium settles into a rigid caste society like the
Ziru Sirrka before it (any one who thinks Victorian England wasn\'t a rigid
caste society had best go back and look at the history books!) ripe for
plucking. Hmmm, then Dulinor decides to try plucking it...looks like the
seeds of the Rebellion were planted very early indeed!

There\'s a loading manual for black powder guns that gives that data for a

Lazy customs officers streamline the inspection. Just ask "you got any
fissionables on board ?", then spray the ship with a nuke damper. Works
like a a dream.

True, but fighters will IMO usually be using either batteries or The
Abomonation Known As Fusion Plus, as the minimum sizes for Fusion plants
are now too big for cost-effective use in small craft.

The other thing is that batteries are pretty efficient. I suspect that the
battery to kick-start the fusion plant is only about a hundred ccs or so.

This is off memory, and I\'m sure other people can remember better than I do.

The Darrians were a small, isolated group of Humaniti in the Spinward
Marches who got contacted by Solomani emigres during the Long Night (a
company based in Izmir, Turkey, Terra pulled the big relocate to avoid the
Long Night related depression).

They went from TL3 to TL12 in about 50 years with the assistance of the
migrants and proceeded to keep advancing technologically, past that
achieved in the RoM.

They peaked at TL 16, 17 in some fields, when the Magriz happened.
Essentially, some researchers were mucking around with a research project
on the Darrian home system\'s sun (I think it involved meson beams), and
they triggered a nova.

Whammie. Game over man. Massive technological regression, wave front that
fries electronics etc for 12 parsecs around (progressing at the speed of
light, so the colonies got some warning) etc etc etc.

By the time the Darrians got back into space, the Sword Worlds and Zhodani
were nearby. The Darrians claimed they had the Ultimate Weapon, the Star
Trigger, and no-one argued. It actually took about 600 years before they
figured out how to turn what they had into a viable weapon. 

They pulled a bluff on their neighbours - they developed damn good
techniques to detect oncoming novas (funny thing that ... do stars have
repeat novas, like people have repeat heart attacks ?), and they found one
well in advance and told their neighbours they were going to blow up this
sun, just to make sure the Star Trigger still worked.

Needless to say, the Darrians didnt get seriously annoyed by the Zhodani.
Politically, they have served as a balance to the Sword Worlds, and they
developed a fair amount of friendship with the Imperium.

OK. Darrian culture values research and innovation highly. Their main art
form is "flame sculptures", which are maintained by a combination of
contra-gravity, fuel and oxygen jets to create living sculptures of fire.
They arent militaristic (although someone somewhere on the list once ran a
campaign with a Darrian AI ship who was ranked, at Lietenent Colonel,
higher than the players and would countermand their orders when neccessary)
but have a good, professional navy (mostly TL 12-13 by 1100, but with a
couple of relic TL16 ships). 

Thats about what I remember. Can someone with a copy of the Darrians Aliens
module give me a mark out of ten ?

I have a funny feeling that this design violates the minimum size of
thruster plates. Apart from that, I would immediatly sandpaper the hull
down to bare metal ... you *want* a high sensor profile in a lifeboat. 

I would also go for at least partial streamlining, just in case you
actually are near enough a planet with a breathable atmosphere.

It also needs a laser comm, which I feel would be more common in space than
radios (long range radios are too big and take up too much surface area).
The radio is useful, as it can just signal "Mayday" forever.

I would also add a set of solar panels, to keep the corpisicles chilled and
power the radio.

The armour factor also needs to go up to 20, to protect against
micrometeorites.

If you have surface area left over, you might want to make the craft more
spherical. This will reduce surface area, and thus the amount of armour the
craft needs. OTOH surface area tends to be an important limit for warships.

I dont like only flight computers. A small real computer would provide help

computers as backups.

Is the craft likely to need a 1000 AU laser comm ? If so, keep it. If not,
downgrade and save some credits.

My instincts say dump the AEMS and upgrade the LIDAR. You have a detection
range of 5 light seconds or so with the PEMS, so you should detect the
enemy well outside weapons range.

The alternative is to eliminate the AEMS and add an auxilary PEMS, in case
of combat damage.

Whats the megajoulage on this laser ? Whatever it is, increase it to as
close to the TL maximum of 600 MJ as you can, sacrificing ROF if
neccessary. You want a weapon that hurts the enemy, not pisses them off.

I also strongly suggest building a variant with less gees and thicker

AF 20 can be penetrated by civilian 250 MJ lasers. Not nice.

It\'s a cool low threat level fighter. Good for anti-piracy work (add a

Yeah. This is also what tends to happen to underarmed militias that go play
with real militaries that have air and armour support. They either have to
become politically equipped for a guerrilla war or they get wiped out in
short order.

Getting grav tanks and spaceships may also be difficult if the Imperium
doesnt want you to have them (or lets people know that selling them to you
on credit is a bad idea, becasue you are planning to go play with the IN).

Nope. T-plates have a minimum size, which puts the cost of a t-plate
powered missile at over MCr 2.5

I\'d need someone who knows more about active sensors than I do to give a
definitive answer, but I suspect you could identify and track a ball
bearing at 10 000km, and then fry the ones on an intercept course with a
laser.

Unless someone can make a non-det laser work, then missiles are essentially
a military weapon in the Traveller universe.

If the other side has a laser, a decent active sensor and decent

Scott, stick with the assumptions in Pocket Empires. Generate and plug in
Economic Extention numbers (resources, culture, labour and infrastructure)
and calculate the GWPs from there. We dont need a Canon Source (FS mk 2)
that disagrees with the Canon Rules (Pocket Empires).

This only works for goods that are being bought because they are useful.
Status goods, or goods bought *because* they embody labour (eg handmade
rugs), are not going to follow these rules.

These goods are a signifigant part of luxury goods trade.

Or to put it another way ... building a fusion plant requires skill,
machinery and raw materials. Painting a masterpiece requires genius. You
can always train more skill, build more machinery and access more raw
materials but genius only comes along so often.

Fusion plus is also a bad example, because it is one of the more useless
technologies in that it does not allow the impossible, it only makes the
possible more efficient.

The two killer TL12 technologies are the nuclear damper and the meson
screen, both because they allow what is absolutely impossible at TL11 and
below.

Contragravity is also useful - it reduces the effort of getting orbital by
99%. It would take, what, two TL10 big air rafts to replace the Space
Shuttle ?

The other killer technology is, of course, the Jump Drive.

Completely disagree. You have an entire spectrum of status and cultural

If the asteroid miners like "real bread" from far away, and are willing to
pay Cr 2 per 1 liter loaf for it, thats a cargo worth Cr 28 000 per dton.
Sure, they can eat machine made goop that looks tastes and feels like real
bread, but it isnt real bread. And a man has to spend his pay on something ...

Nope. Financial intermediaries (eg Hortalez et Cie) are part of Traveller
background. Your friendly local megacorporation will lend you the money to
develop your planet, if they consider you a good risk. They may even put up
the money themselves, if they think it is worth it.

The range of TLs can be explained by a world\'s TL being it\'s level of local
manufacturing. They have lots of higher TL stuff, they just dont make it here.

Coolness. I would suggest 0-15, which is what most other Trav rating go

This rating will help referees describe a world - is it a Tainted thin
atmospere becasue it is a barely cooled lump of rock, or does it have
ecosystems that will make the entire University of Sylea Biology Department

No. Do not invalidate Pocket Empires !

- ----
I would also note (from personal experience) that for many (possibly most)
people "always" translates as one generation, three at most.  Anything
further back than living menory is "ancient history", not "hallowed
tradition".  

For example, some* of the gray-haired parishioners at my Anglican church
complain about any hymn that doesn\'t have organ music; they want
_traditional_ hymns.  When I point out that organs were an innovation of
the mid-19th century, that before that most Anglican churches had bands
playing whatever instruments they had, and that some of their favourite
"traditional music" was actually composed for the music-hall stage, they
say things like "you know what I mean" and "no respect for tradition".

*Note the word "some".  Not all the older folks are like this, and
(unfortunately) some of the younger ones are.

Remember the Liberator .45in Flare Projector?  Built by the OSS for the
French Resistance, it was a single-shot, 1/2" barreled pistol.  The idea
was that you killed a German soldier and took his weapon.

Your rag-tag band of rebels might get ahold of a resonable cache of arms
that way.

Don\'t forget that the whole series was Patrick McGoohan\'s baby. So I
*really* doubt that there was much "can\'t figure out what to do" involved.

It occurs to me that a group of players who "knew too much" could be
dumped in The Village. And whether or not they\'d seen the series, it\'d
drive them *nuts*. After all, The Village is *clearly* on a seacoast.
Except that in at least one episode, #6 headed away from the coast and
found himself looking down into a valley from *way* up in the mountains
(without having climbed noticeably from The Village).

I seriously doubt it. What are they going to use for *air*? And,
assuming enough air, you also have to deal with the rest of life
support. In order of importance:

1. heating/cooling (you can fry or freeze depending on conditions)
2. removal of CO2
3. toilet facilities
4. water
5. food

You can futz with the lower priority items, depending on how long you
expect the lifeboat to occupied.

1. Required for anything over a few *minutes*
2. Required for an hour or more
3. required for 6 or more hours
4. required for a day or more
5. required for multiday occupancy.

And they\'ll need comm gear. At least a distress beacon. And a medical
kit. Attitude thrusters may be needed as part of the temp control
system. 

And I disagree with a previous poster. If all you need to do is get the
lifeboat away from the ship (a few g-minutes? more likely less than a
g-minute) it\'s hard to beat simple solid fuel rockets for both cost
*and* reliability. Especially for something that may not get used for
*years*.

At least one of the arguments I\'ve heard advanced is that because Christ\'s
disciples were all men, only men can be priests.  

When I mentioned that Christ had many disciples, and that women are
mentioned as members of his "entourage", the priest I was talking to
changed that to apostles.

I pointed out that no apostles were Philipino either (he was), so by that
argument he couldn\'t be a priest.  (He was the pastor of a fundamentalist
Philipino Baptist church.)  I was told that I didn\'t know how to interpret
Scripture.  (This was a church where a woman could deliver a sermon about
how women should behave, citing Scripture to support her view that they
should cover their heads in public, yet ignoring the next verse in the
same book that also says that they shouldn\'t speak in church.  Consistency
wasn\'t an issue, apparently.)

Not trying to undercut anyone\'s religious beliefs here.  For the record,
although I\'m warden of an Anglican church and am studying to become a lay
reader, I spent a long time ignoring the whole issue of religion except as
an academic exercise.  Then I lost enough close friends that I needed to
believe in souls.  Sometimes I even manage to, but I wouldn\'t call myself
devout.

Sorry - I guess I was rushing too much.  Arcane was a British magazine,

Some kinds of fusion powerplants *do* induce radioactivity. 

On the other hand, a nuke warhead will *not* trigger a geiger counter
at any appreciable range. The fissionables *aren\'t* all that
radioactive (half-life in the millions of years IRRC). And they mostly
emit alpha particles, which can be stopped by a sheet of tinfoil.

geiger counter. The counter *will* register. You see, that *bright*
white glow is due to thorium oxide....

Simple. While the plate is on, inertial mass is greatly reduced. When
you turn it off, you resume your original inertial mass, which means
that your vector shortens *considerably*. 

The simplests case to calculate is where the inertial mass is reduced
to zero. In that case, when you cut the drive, you resume your original
vector (magnitude and direction). 

For partial neutralization it gets messier. But your final vector is
still based on the original vector, just modified by the "new one. If
forget how the percentages go. I worked it out once, but I don\'t have
the formulas handy.

relationship (shown in a graph in the book) as well as a T^4 
relationship between temperature (aka spectral class) and Luminosity.

Mass from Luminosity
====================
I decided to fit a straight line to the stellar data from Scouts (CT 
Book 6) ... luckily I did not have to type the data in, as Rob Prior 
has it as part of his most-useful Worldbuilders spreadsheet for Excel.

For everything except dwarf stars (type VII) the linear approximation 
is:

ln(Lum) = 3.5 ln(Mass)

or

ln(Mass) = ln(Lum) / 3.5

Where Lum and Mass are in solar units (Lum = 1 for the sun; Mass = 1 
for the sun).

For dwarf stars (type VII) I have fitted a quadratic:

ln(Lum) = (4.7062 ln(Mass) + 0.9798) ln(Mass) - 10.387

or

ln(Mass) = (0.0396 ln(Lum) + 0.3567 ) ln(Lum) - 0.6059

Radius from Luminosity
======================
Lum = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4

Where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.  If we want to use Solar 
units for Lum and stellar radius, then I calculate that

sigma = 7.1 e-17

Note that the Luminosity/radius relationship does not fit all of the 
data in Scouts ... this may be due to the use of visual (rather than 
all-wavelength) data for determining luminosity.  Perhaps someone more 
expert than me can tell us that.

You have to cross-index againts the H-R diagram. :-(

For a given spectral class, in many cases there are *two* possible
locations on the chart. For example, an M star could could a red dwarf
on the main sequence, *or* a red giant and well *off* the main
sequence. 

The only way to distinguish the two is by luminosity. Radiius only
comes in as a sort of "side effect".

This will also give you the *age* of the star. You see, the *real*
determinants with regards to stars are mass and age. Temp and
luminosity are "derived" from those.

I refer you to the incident during one of the early waris in America,
where a bunch of Quakers (most *definitely* pacifists) prevented an
attack on their town by setting up a cannon pointing down the road the
enemy would be approaching on. 

The enemy decided that given the lack of cover, they\'d go bother
somebody else. Much later, when asked how they could *do* such a thing,
the Quakers replied that they never *loaded* the cannon!

This may be the origin of the joke about the Quaker confronting a
burglar. Said Quaker is clutching his hunting rifle and says:
"Friend, I would not harm thee for the world. But thou standest where I
am about to shoot!"

You\'d appreciate what happened at one of New Yorks major hospitals when
the blackout hit. They\'d recently installed an emergency generator and
so the engineer on duty confidently pressed the start button....

And nothing happened. Their generator had an *electric* fuel pump, and
no batteries. They had to drege fuel out of the tank, and run spare
tubing up several flights of stairs to get enough pressure to start the
motor. 

Another hospital had a better designed backup system. It switched over
automatically, and everything was going fine. Except that it was in a
sub-basement. Next to the river. And the sump pump wasn\'t on the
emergency power board. By the time they realized the sub-basement was
flooding, it was too late to hook the pumps up. So the generator
drowned.

I include the above as examples for referees to use when their players
don\'t think a problem thru. :-)

I can see shutting down the plant because the engineer wants to
"tinker" with something. As with a modern ship, you tend to keep some
onboard power going (even *commercial* vessels of any size tend to have
multiple generators), simply because generating it yourself is cheaper
than paying for a power feed from the dock (ships use a *lot* of
power). Also, in some of the more remote ports, the local power isn\'t
what you want to trust your ship\'s gear too. Too many fluctuations in
voltage and frequency.

When you *do* shut down everything (or when a junoir engineering rating
screws up and shguts off the fuel to the only *running* generator :-),
you can fire up a portable unit and use that to start one of the
smaller generators, use that to fire one of the biggies ("bootstrap").
Or you can use the power from dockside.

In Traveller terms, I suspect that a portable generator would put out
enough power to start an air-raft or simliar item, and that would put
out enough to start a ships boat or "small" auxilulary power plant. And
that would be enough to start the ship. It\'s just a royal pain. 

Just off the top of my head, I\'d say a plant can start a plant that
has up to 10 times the output. Maybe 100. Adjust to whatever "seems
right". 

ps. Even a "small" Taveller ship will use as much power as a small
office building. And just *ask* a building engineer how much *that* is!
Lighting and HVAC use up *incredible* amounts of power. And you can\'t
exactly shut them down on a whim.

My take is this.

Given the things we *currently* know, making a nuke is *not* all that
hard. We keep coming up with new ways to seperate the isotopes, and
they keep getting cheaper.

So when you add a few tech levels I see *no* way to effectively prevent
any group of nuts with some time and cash from building a nuke. It\'d be
about on a par with the difficulty of building the "fertilizer" bombs
used against the World Trade Center in NY, or in OK city. 

At the same time, just as "blasting oil" (the proper name for the mix
in the above bombs) is used in a lot of industries, and there are even
booklets from the goverment telling farmers how to make it and use it
to remove stumps, there are going to be *legit* civilian uses.

So, I suspect that the rules will be a bit different than what we\'ve
assumed. *Using* a nuke "improperly" is worth a quick trip to the
executioner. But for "appropriate" uses such as some kinds of mining
and engineering, and det-nuke missiles for ships, they are quite legal,
but controlled. 

So, one thing that\'ll happen to a missile armed ship every time it
visits a port is that an inspector from Imperial Naval Ordnance will
drop by and check the serial numbers on the warheads as well as your
paperwork on them. (non-ship users are inspected by the Imperial Army,
or the local government).

If you can\'t account for what happened to a warhead, or you have one
that the paperwork doesn\'t check out on, then you may be in serious
trouble. 

Sure, it may take a while for the reports to get together that show you
had nine warheads when you visited port A, and only eight when you
visited port B. But once they do, the Navy is going to want to have a
*long* talk with you. Ditto if you wind up with an extra.

Think of a demolition company or contractor having to explainm a
discrepancy with his explosives).

It *is* possible to obtain illegal nukes. But doing so is a serious
crime. As is misusing legal ones. But since Piracy is *already* a
capital crime, well, they can only kill you once.

In the case of ships the communications lag would require the equivalent of
a ships transponder on the missles/missletubes.  Don\'t want the ships crew
forging the documents easily now do we?

Demo teams planet side or in system would be a lot easier to police,
interstellar vessels would be a _Real_ pain!

Personally I think that the problems with trying to police Nuclear weapons
would cause them to be classified as something that the average citizen
wouldn\'t be allowed to have.  Furthermore, the Imperium probably has some
_serious_ detectors for checking ships out to see if they are carrying
Nukes.  I\'m sorry, the average citizen doesn\'t need Nukes, or X-Ray Lasers.
It would be a _very_ difficult and time consuming process to get a license
for a nuclear weapon, even if it\'s only being used in deep space demolition
work.

Yep.  I have used this, and it pissed the players off tremedously, when
they had just gotten thier well shielded compartment filled with detlaser
heads full.

They spent MONTHS trying to get back enough warheads to matter.  Of course,
the peoeple were trying to appraoch Shudusham, which is not real tolerant
in my world.

They were even more annoyed when they realized that all they needed to do
was say "yes, three crates, numbers 114, 117, and 119.  The rest of the
ship would get cleared, and those boxes would get looked at.

I would suggest that the standard 1-week-in-port task be changed from
\'cold start\' to \'warm start\'.  True cold starts should be relatively rare;
Eris\'s list gives a good set of scenarios where it could happen.

The Progressive Union of Sayat Spofulams will solve this problem, but not
until c. 1205 T.I.

In the meantime, where are the Wobblies?  No, seriously.

No; KE is not a vector quantity.  It is defined as

  KE = 0.5 m v^2

where m is the mass and v is the speed, indpendent of direction, in the
observer\'s frame.  That last clause is the kicker -- the KE of an object
is observer-dependent; two observers moving relative to one another will
never agree on the KE of any object.

> Thruster plates change vector (even if simply used for skipping 
> around the system).

True.  Momentum *is* a vector quantity (P = mV).  Any change in velocity
vector requires force (F = dP/dt = mA [if m is constant]).  Thrusters
provide that force.

> How can a change in vector not change the KE potental of an object? 
> Unless 1) the mass goes down, 2) vector is not changed (al la jump).

By swinging the direction of the velocity vector around without changing
its magnitude.  A 1 kg object travelling south at 1 m/s and a 1 kg object
travelling north at 1 m/s (in my frame) have identical KE, and identical
magnitude of momentum, but opposite momentum vectors.  Causing the
southbound object to turn around and head north at 1 m/s will require
acceleration, and hence energy expenditure to provide the force, but in
the end, the KE is unchanged.

At TL 12 one could assume a savings of only 10% on volume and 2.5% on mass
on Fusion plants.  Fusion+ plants don\'t need the jump start.

My take is a little more complex. Fission is a basic technology for TL7-11,
but it becomes less neccessary when you have the smaller fusion power
plants at TL12. Add The Abomonation Known As Fusion Plus and you could
eventually decommission most of the fission power plants.

Now, the Third Imperium wants this, and tries to encourage it, but cannot
actually declare fission power plants illegal, as the Imperium\'s
constituent worlds rely on them too much.

If fission plants were rarer, then fissionables would be harder to get, the
number of fission techs would be smaller and the problem of civilian nukes
would be far more controllable.

I believe that it would be a subtle process, concentrating firstly on
fission plants that use Imperial starports - essentially you have tougher
safety inspections on them (maybe Hard vs average of Admin and Engineering)
than apply to fusion powerplants.

The Imperium may also apply special taxes and onerous paperwork on
fissionables - you would probably have to document where every gram of
production went, complete with end user certificates and so on.

The IN will also want to be the only user of nuke det laser weapons,
because a nuke det missile can do signifigant damage to a small warship.

Also, given that you need lots of missiles to guarantee a hit in the face
of laser counter-missile fire, my guess is that most civilians just wont
bother with missile racks. Sandcasters and lasers are the way to go for
civilian uses, with PAWs if you are loading for bear.

I think piracy with nukes would be a more urgent issue than piracy using
civilian weapons. Kinda like the difference between bank robbery with a
shotgun and bank robbery with a RPG-7.

Fair enough :) They would probably have a serial number carved on the

Agreed. I actually suspect that you would actually be required to
subcontract the job to the IN Corps of Engineers or equivalent. On full
cost recovery, of course. At minimum, you\'d need to buy the nuke off the
Imperial government at your local class C or better starport, and it\'d have
a tech babysitting it all the way until it went boom. Again, full cost
recovery applies.

Nahhh. Batteries are pretty massy - 2t per m3. I actually suspect it would
be as little as 2% on volume and mass. Not really worth it.

I also dont see a need to add the complexity for this little gain. YMMV.

Careful about those snips.  I didn\'t say that.  It was something I quoted.  The

  So the standard hierarchy goes, if one were interested in ranks and such for a
hypothetical religious order/career, would be:

Acolyte/Alter-boy
Seminarian?
Deacon
Priest - minimum one per church.
Bishop - one per system
Archbishop - one per subsector
Cardinal - like Dukes - one per sector
Pope - Whole church

But where do Monsignors fit in.  And Monks and Abbots.  Would the latter be
similar to enlisted ranks?  Perhaps:
Novice
Initiate
Brother
Master
Abbot

Any comments on this potential table for a catholic-style of hierarchy?

Every time I research something, I am constantly amazed by the fringe groups
that  turn up when I poke around :)  I was trying to get info on wet-ships and
boats for Traveller, when I came across people who made model warships with
compressed-air bb-cannons that they\'d fight with, dredge \'em back up, patch
them up, and fight with them some more...  I had come across the Old West
folks, and was duly impressed :)  Do you have any more info on the Black
Powder Handbook or the Dixie Gunworks catalog?

I\'m not a Wobbly. But I know folks who are. I do have a copy of the

Some other songs seem to fit better. Such as "Christians at War". But
who knows, maybe I can come up with something...

What good does the nuke damper do? It only suppresses reactyions
*while* it is aimed at something. And if you had it set for enhance
mode, the resulting blast would get the inspector chewed out.

And what about my "Old Trader" that\'s got a fission powerplant and
NERVA type rocket propulsion? :-)

Nope. Not at all. For one thing Uranium has uses other than using it in
reactors or bombs. For one, it\'s one of the few *decent* yellow glazes
for ceramics. It gives a good orange, too. 

Anybody building a bomb *wouldn\'t* be getting their fissionables from a
reactor. It\'s actually *easier* to refine fissionables from *ore* than
from used fuel elements. The ore isn\'t nearly as radioactive and
doesn\'t have all those *very* radioactive fission by-products in it. 

Given the tech likely to be available, refining the the metal from ore
(it doesn\'t take all *that* much) and then seperating out the
fissionable isotope is a doable "basement" project.

Why? No offense, but *ships* are more dangerous than nukes. And most of
the uses for uranium and thorium are such that the type of controls you
are talking about would be ludicrous.

Do you notice that sort of control on sales of fuel oil or fertilizer?
Then the Imperium won\'t have them on "ordinary" uranium and thorium.

Must be a different booklet. It was the USDA that issued the one I know
about. :-)

My current game group has two female players... in our 2300 style game
there are 4 PC\'s, three of which are female and my lone confused male (why
confused? He has a flaw \'thinks he has come to bed eyes\').

Prior to that, our T4 M1100 game had one female player (briefly two) out of
five. However, there were 3 female PCs in play.

In a six month campaign we had one firefight (started by our 16 year old
testosterone loaded young lad!) - it beacame that the players were more
unconfortable going to restaurants than going out adventuring (I must
finish the write up).

And we have two regulars, and one not so regular.
One played a pilot and the other a female marine captain
noted for her morale-boosting hot-tub parties, and her psionic

I recommend that anyone who is interested in low TL firearms pick up the
catalog. If nothing else it is a fascinating reference to the art of TL-3
and 4 gunsmithing. About 50 or so pages in the back are devoted to
reference material only, including instructions on literally hand-loading
cartridges.

It\'s also got a huge list of refernce books for sale, which serve as a
great source to look for in the library, covering just about all aspects
of (roughly) 18th-19th century life, with an emphasis on material for
re-enactors, so it\'s lots of stuff about clothing, tools, weapons, etc.

Not exactly.  If I understand what they are proposing, then ship Z would
resume (in whole, or in part) the vector it had before turning the TP\'s on.
Here\'s what I think they say is going on.

   (TP\'s off)        |(TP\'s on )    |  (TP\'s back off)
 /~~~\\               |   /~~~\\      |   /~~~\\
 | M | --(6)-->      |   | M |      |   | M |
 \\___/               |   \\___/      |   \\___/
   Z                 |     Z        |        With TP\'s off ship   
 Moon is moving 6    |    / Ship    |        loses TP induced vector
 and Z is on surface |   /  lifts   |        & resumes previous one 
                     | (8)  & moves |     
                     | /    out     |  --(6)-->
  
It\'s probably a little more compliated than that because the old vectors
would still be in effect so in the middle diagram Z is moving 6 to the east
*and* 8 to the soutwest.  And if the TP induced vector isn\'t wholely
psuedo, then it might end up with 6 east and 2 southwest when you finish. 
This could give the impression that a ship slows down when the TP\'s go
off..or that it speeds up, depending on the observer\'s frame of reference.

Personally, I prefer to use stutterwarp (restricted to STL), or
Ether-propellers.

	Anybody who currently wants to buy a bomb can do so. German BND has

	ago, as there was no official claiming to give the order to do so.
	IMHO the bomb was given to Gladius.

	Imho fusion give the posibility to taboo dirty nuclear power, and
	a lot of governments will do so, restricting them to military use.
	So a government may decide that only the highport is extrality
	zone, and I would not even be allowed for a TL:9 fission/heplar
	ship to land at downport. Other government will bann nuclear
	missiles in their system, allowing them only for own SDB\'s and
	perhaps for imperial Navy. Any merchant or mercenary ship who has
	them will be confiscated. Others like mining colonies on asteroid
	belts will use fission frequently, not only for power, but as 
	demolition for mining.

	So I think that nuclears will be restricted in some system, but
	not by imperial law. While nuclear weapons will be restricted
	to system defense and navy. The wast MT canon had several places
	making it likely that nuclear missiles are not accessable for
	jo average free trader. T4 has two types of missiles KKMs making
	1 point damage and xray/nukes making 2 points.

Better be a damn good deal, and have lots of plausable deniability. Getting

I think we have different interpreations on how nuke dampers work.

I am working out of Stiker mod 1 book 2, particularily rule 40E "Radiation
suppression : Another use of nuclear dampers is to eliminate the
contamination created by a nuclear weapon detonation. Instead of performing
it\'s usual missions, a damper may be assigned to eliminate the radiation
from one nuclear strike per fire phase. Both the crater and the area of
induced radiation are rendered permanently harmless."

My read on this is that Nuke Dampers can, as well as temporarily
suppressing nuclear ractions, make radiactive material permanently inert.

This is one of the things that makes fighting a TL12 navy with more
primitive technology A Real Bitch.

>

Thats why they ask you "anything to declare ?" and give you a foot-thick
stack of paperwork when you say "Yeah, a 50 MW fission plant and a 200 kN
NERVA drive".

Also, could you post the design for the Old Trader. I want to build one
with FFS2, but if you\'ve already don the work, great :)

What about plutonium breeder reactors ? My take is a PBR is a TL8+ fission
plant. But I\'m not a nuke expert, so I\'m probably wrong.

I also noted that the Imperium would want to heavily regulate the nuclear
mining business.

Can you turn a TL9+ fusion poweplant into a bomb ? I know you cant with a
modern fission plant. A ship trying to do the Frac C rock thing would (IMO)
get blown up by planetary defense forces sent on an intercept course.

While ANFO doesnt have these controls, other explosives do ... at least
around here, you need a licence to buy gelignite. In the mining town of
Coober Pedy, they stored it in the supermarket fridge, in between the
butter, eggs and milk.

the main world of a star system determines availability of supply and
starship patterns. Also, not excluding other secondary exchanges
distributed throughout in-system, eg: on substantial colonies on other
planets & moons within the star system.

It is thus interesting to see the effects of speculative cargo on
Imperium trade routes. 

< TL Transfer >

One must also not rule out a higher TL world locating its industries on
a lower TL world -effectively raising the lower TL to the same level as
the host planet. Megacorporations can do this quite easily. If the
technology is proprietary, TL level would remain unchanged. Given the
wider range of TL difference, local employment (training), race
differences (culture): roll a dice and +DM to see how effective TL
transfer can be. Someone do a table here...

< Brokers >

Basically , I have a request for a good, say AI robots at a high enough
price for suppliers to ship, would I not sell it for profit
in/out-system at a higher unit/wholesale price?

What is to stop my customer from buying it? Therein, the theory that
Exchange refered to in past TML posts are WHOLESALE MARKETS. This ties
in
closely with Terra history, where actual agricultural and commodity
products take place among brokers only. It isn\'t necessary to have an
Exchange to ensure a demand for a good at a star system. There could be
outside trade in/out system in other products to pay for them. 

But Caveat...

Once a certain population has been saturated with a certain good, it is
unlikely that demand for that good, in that region, will continue at
that level. Interstellar merchantile trade for that good would come to
an end, occasionally spiked by demand for replacements / upgrades. 

< Speculative Cargo : Market >

An EXCHANGE defers from a MARKET; where in the former products can be
sold & re-sold *more than once*, in the latter goods are meant for sale
only *once*. Therein, the theory that individual brokers buy at
_wholesale prices_ + large quantities from in/out-system on a one-to-one
basis and then trades them in smaller quantities at _unit retail prices_
where the prices are more affordable. This would be a PUBLIC MARKET. 

Thus, we see the BROKERS MARKET, is a wholesale one-on-one basis.
Decentralized in nature. Perhaps linked by data terminals throughout the
Imperium. (Like a classifieds ad.) Being lesser in absolute traders,
would have high prices - perhaps MCr range. It could span more than 1
city on a planet/in-system. 

The PUBLIC MARKET is where smaller brokers buy & sell smaller quantites,
perhaps refurbishing / upgrading some components in a good.

< EXCHANGES >

In such a system, where shipments are slow. We see the volume of
transactions in the PUBLIC MARKET to be greater than the BROKERS MARKET. 

But see, what happens if we separate the physical goods and the prices
(represented on pieces of paper)...under such a system, transactions
speed up. With shipments at max Jump-6, we can envision greater price
volume on EXCHANGES than MARKETS. Whereas, a price adjustment by other
suppliers or brokers take days/weeks to change, a price adjustment by
traders in prices takes secs/minutes.

Let\'s say, a city/cities in-system needs at least an aggregate base
population level for demand (out-system: the other cities pop level is
added.) & appropriate tech level (for comms) to establish an Exchange. 

Here, it is more than a MARKET for goods. Scripts / contracts
representing fixed amount of a good at a certain quality and grade are
bought or sold while the actual good stays with established
depositories, suppliers, clients and dedicated warehouses. 

< Brokers Markets -> Public Market -> Centralized Exchange -> Brokers
Exchange -> OTC Exchange >

Here we see the progression: From merchantile trade (economics) to
institutional speculation (eg: mutual fund). We can lump them as an
\'Exchange\' and give a clssification code. Much like slave (foreign
labour) traders do not have to bring the goods to an EXCHANGE, only the
MARKET, shipment patterns would be considerably less. 

Starships only need concern with transporting goods to warehouse
operators, who deal with wholesale brokers. Warehouses would have a
constant supply of these goods. It is also possible for starships to
deal with end-client trading firms, who may/may not deal with these
brokers, if the price is right.

In such a scenario, it is highly possible for a star system to engage in
speculation, but not actual shipment/delivery. Thus, only money is
moving, not cargo.

Will you guys KNOCK IT OFF???  I\'m really rather hurt by the insinuation
that I have any desire whatsoever to do anything violent or explosive or...
bangy.  If I want to play with radioactives, I\'ll just rummage through the

Ian,

Can you *not* post background stuff that is from "referee\'s only" bits
without at least trailing a spoiler warning in the header? This example
(the Star Trigger\'s viability) could quite easily blow a hole in someones
M1100 campaign.

Sure you guys wouldn\'t like to be helping write entries for 101 Religions?!
Some good thoughts there.

On the subject of religious careers, if there are folk who\'ve been playing
around with them - is there anyone who\'s tried using the Universal Religion
Profile (as described in Grand Census and World Builder\'s Handbook) to
describe a *characters* religious outlook (or NPC)?

Missiles in space combat will either be nuclear or KE. There will ALWAYS be
more kinetic energy in a missile per kilogram than conventional explosives
can deliver unless space combat ranges are MUCH shorter than the 30 000 km
per hex or so.

As of today all naval ships has some kind of defense-system against
missiles. eg the US Navy has it\'s PHALANX which is capable of destroying
virtually ALL incoming missiles that is visible on the radar. These systems
usually has a range of 3-4 km and consists of several autocannons (vulcan).
If all Naval ships in traveller carried the TL10+ versions of those,
wouldn\'t the KE missiles be virtually obsolete? A standard KE autocannon
sure is quite usless in space combat but i suppose that if it starts to fire
at incoming KE missiles at some 30000m it would probably score some hits
because missiles usually fly in a VERY predictable path. If these systems
exists, it would make the x-ray missiles much more useful, esp the ones
(TL15) that detonates a hex away. Why not design a "vulcan laser" ?
Specifically designed to shoot "down" missiles....

(One of the pictures in the Darrian Module shows a girl walking through a

They are tall and thin, showing a genetic alteration which makes them burn
their meals rather than store it as fat. So Darrians never heard of the
concept of a diet, which makes some women of other people a little
jealous. They also have a good adaptation to temperature because of this -
if they get cold, they eat more.

The Darrian Language is te-zlodh, for which an example is given in the
module (Darrian spell their homeworld Daryen, as mentioned in TNE
material). I have got this module, but this was written from memory
either. 

The Darrians are a race which sometimes was seen by my characters,
but not contacted yet. How many SF stories also use aliens with pointed
ears?

It is not strictly true to say that we have any seperate "Faculty of
Numerology" at the Institute.  Rather it would be correct to say that
all the scholars study the Fourfold Way since the way of the universe is
that (for humans) everything that happens in fours is significant.  When
you can see this you will see all.

This truth was in fact first proven by the Darmine mathematician/wise

of Ishag by the [old fashioned/rigid/boring/sexually repressed] Vilani
circa -4100.

There are _no_ coincidences.  We do not use this word, save as a loan

It is possible that you will, regrettably, not ever be able to
understand the Fourfold Way.  Four implies a duality of dualities.

The sun and the moons are in the sky.
The land and the water are on the planet.

The sun and the land are (relatively) unchanging.
The moons and the water are constantly changing.

The sun and the water bring life.
The moons (4) and the land bring death.

We have serious questions as to whether or not you Sayat, being
fundamentally the same and not posessing the male/female dichotemy can
ever understand duality.  We will be happy to try and enlighten you,
naturally standard instructional fees will apply.

> may neglect to fully account for the ontonumeric properties of _one_.

Of course we understand the importance of one.  One is, after all 4^0.

This is not a childs game among us.  Seeing fours in iteration is an
adult concept.  To allow children to try it may encourage pedantry in
the young.  In addition it is not really required as most patterns of
four can be seen by simple addition.

Your comments on Guaran suggest that you may have forgotten that the
Fourfold Way of the universe is not for nonhuman.  They have different
numbers that are of significance to them, this is what alien means after
all - one whose [fundamental reality/weltanshung] is not fourfold.

Translators notes

(1)	[preserve/sustain/strengthen/uphold] 	This is all one word in Kadli.

(2)	The word water in this context also means any medium in which
journeys are made, air, outerspace, jump space, etc.

(3)	The usage of others in this context implicitly implies
_unenlightened_ others.

(4) 	In this context moons means night.  Do to its current very low
atmosperic density, due to the devestation caused by the perfidious
Vilani, [Is it our fault their much vaunted Shugili did not understand
the concept of cumulative heavy metal poisoning and we did not
understand their lack of tolerance for properly spiced food ?  The
Vilani then developed the (false) conclusion that we deliberately
poisoned their initial envoys and never really trusted us.] the nights
are very cold on Ishag.  Even with our peoples enthusiastic levels of
togetherness and action at night (orgies) the cold at night is one of
the leading causes of death in non technical populations.

I agree that ships are more dangerous than nukes and we all know what
handwaving is required to avoid that from crashing the canon but the
Imperium IS canon-wise very restrictive about nukes. The Imperial rules of
war expressly forbids any use of nukes wether one is a mercenary unit or
whatever. Either we ignore that part of the Imperial rules of war or we
cannot have det x-ray laser missiles. I prefer the latter: X-det lasers are
only available to military forces and the normal player characters can have
unlicensed KE missiles.

     I\'ve generated PE stats for all the worlds of the 3rd Imperium and I\'m
playing with them in a database. I\'ve used standard PE genreation except
that I\'ve assumed that by M1100 all worlds will have built their
infrastructure up to the most profitable level.
     You can find the sector data up on
ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/trav/sectors.zip
     You can find the PE data up on

file suitable for importation into most DB & spreadsheet programs.
     [The PE generation was done with new code in the ttg\'s java
libraries.]

     There are a total of 8496 worlds in the 3rd Imperium.
     Here are the Imperium wide averages:
     Resources      8
     Labour         4
     Infrustructure 6
     Culture        6
     Base Demand    7
     Total Demand   6
     Labour Factor  16.9
     Base Tax       22%
     Social Tax     11%

     Govern Budget  119.6 RU
     Military Expn  80.8 RU
     Civilian Expn  38.8 RU
       Military Size  21


The total Imports are 1979, Exports 13398. The discontinuity is because PE
doesn\'t make you specify where you are importing from or where you are
exporting to. It is interesting in that it implies that the Imperium, as a
whole, has more than enough resources to meet its needs.

The Gross Imperial Product (sum of all Gross World Products) is 4,804,366
RU. Assuming the suggested 10% median tax, the Annual Imperial Revenue is
93,991 RU.

The planet with the highest GWP is Khaklan, 3220 Reaver\'s Deep at 66,150
RU. This accounts for 2.6% of the Imperial Revenue! 20% of the Imperial
Revenue is accounted for amongst 15 planets.
62 planets have a GWP of over 10,000 RU. 381 planets have a GWP of over
1,000 RU.

There are 6227 worlds (73%) contribute less than .05 RU each to the
Imperial coffers.

Given the combination of over resources and the underexploitation of
Imperial worlds, you would think that there was a lot more scope for
internal improvement rather than spatial expansion. Something for a much
smaller Pocket Empire to consider...

Mns,

As a Former tech who worked on CIWS ie Phalanx, it can not destroy all
radar detected targets
1. It has limited ready magazine of 20mm rounds, around 900 rounds, less
one second of firing, so it has to be *guided* as to how long it can fire
at any target.
2. It can track targets beyond its firing range which is 2000 yards ie one
nautical mile.
3. CIWS has certain limitations on how it can *engage* targets ie if two or
more incoming targets have the closing rate and range CIWS will not
*engage* those targets.

One KKM approach  that is very workable is to have the missile armored to
resist PD laser fire, you will have to use thruster plates or heplar to do
it very well though.

The KKM missile can carry very small nukes, released prior to the KKM
submunitions, to detonate ahead of the KKM submunitons, creating a sensor
blind spot, allowing the KKM submunitions to get closer to the target.

I have designed two missiles that are *canon* "Bubba" and "Little Bubba"
that can carry nukes, KKM and combinations of both. Both are larger than
the standard size missile but they are designed to be reusable. They have a
duration in hours at 12 G\'s plus. They are intelligent enough not to
present a *predictable*  approach.

Ooops, not a good idea for me to play smartass around here..... :)

What I really thought was that the TL-10+ version may have some
improvements......like a rotary 30mm gauss cannon or something like that and
a superior tracking "radar".

But as Bolie IV replied in the bits of the destroyed KE missile will stil
travel towards the target, so the idea was perhaps not so good
afterall......

I\'ll go for a white globe instead :)

 Just a couple of notes, since I think my knowledge of the system is a bit more
recent than yours (and I\'m about 5 years out of date).

CIWS (block 1 upgrade) has a magazine of about 1500 rounds, 6 second fire range,
can track multiple targets (i.e. using the search radar, not the track radar),
and a 1 second recycle time.  First hit range is [classified I think], but total
fire time would be estimated at 6 seconds.  Each unit is designed to be
effective against 3-5 missiles before reload.

Future upgrades were supposed to have a different gun drive system incorporating
a 2 speed system (slower for initial fire, faster once hits on target were
detected); switching to a 3 barrel, 30mm gun; and they were exploring using
caseless ammunition with a hopper feed.

Aren\'t Traveller missiles assumed to be under drive until the moment of
detonation?  If the target has an active drive, and the missile loses it\'s drive
at any appreciable distance from the target, the vector differences will very
shortly remove it from the field of combat - the only danger it will pose will be
to navigation of _other_ ships.

Slight correction: it\'s "Maghiz," not "Magriz."

I don\'t think they triggered a nova. Just some major solar flares. I could
be wrong as I\'m also doing this from memory. It seems to me that their
central star couldn\'t continue to exist after going nova, though, right?

The rotary autocannons have a problem with ammo capacity, they fire so fast
that having the ammo capacity for them is a bit beyond what most naval
ships would carry. Unless you want a CIWS only ship.

What he said is very true, when I first got on board my ship the armor? was
non existant, so some anti ship missiles had a chance of passing thru the
superstructure before detonating, after getting aluminum armor? removed any
chance of that occuring. but the armor was added to prevent the soft *kill*
due to destroyed missile fragments impacting on the superstruture and
rendering certain functions inop.

Very true, I was discharged in 1985, when to CIWS in General Dyanamics,
Pamona, Ca, USA for my system training. I had some very interesting
discussions with the engineers and tech there on future mods.

Yes I am familar with the Block one mod but it was not implemented on my
platforms when I left. 

Actually I was hoping by now that they would be atleast to Block 2 mod,
with the RAM pods and other goodies. But they may have had implementation
issues to resolve first I hope.

But can the Block 1 mod engage the USSR *spitball* missile, you know the
one at 100,000+ feet, speed excess of mach two, the 85 degree dive attack
angle, a very large conventional warhead or ship vaporizing nuke, without a
designation by another sensor? ie search, track and engage. It could not in
the Mod that my platforms carried.

You mean they still have not put the 30mm into CIWS, damn it.

Actually today they would be better off using liquid propellants that the
army is *playing* with for its cannons.

They were working on putting on RAM \'wings\' or a stand-alone system when I left
the fleet.  I haven\'t really followed the development of CIWS since I left active
drilling (about 2 years ago).

That\'s a toughie...I know that Block 0 was very limited in it\'s search off
horizon - I remember that Block 1 went significantly above 60 degrees, but
I don\'t remember the exact limit (and probably couldn\'t publish it if I could),
but I think that the missile you are referring to would exceed that before it
began it\'s dive.

Based on what I remember, unless the missile was specifically designated (and
only Aegis ships have that capability), the system would disregard it.

That\'s what they should have used on the BB\'s.  It would have made the IOWA

*If* the TP is a partial intertia neutralizer, then the ship would slow
down *when* the TP is shut off. Then it\'d act normally from then on.
Heck, it\'s even possible the the "resumed" vector might have it going
*faster*. 

Again, in the limiting case of *total* neutralization, the ship moves
at a speed limited by drag. And when you cut the drive, your vector is
whatever vector you had when you turned it on. Which may be a high
speed *at* the planet. Or in some other direction.

Messing with inertia tends to be somewhat counter-intuitive. :-)

If anybody needs it to freak out their characters, I\'ve got a
description of *exactly* how one produces saltpeter. It\'ll gross out a
lot of people.

The other steps in producing powder are fairly simple, though not
always what you\'d expect.

Low berths take both space and power. I was replying to a guy who was

Sure. But they are also a *bigger* problem on a "lifeboat" because you
have more people in a smaller volume, and need high reliability. And
you want low cost too.

Monsignors (and Metropolitans, and a few other such things) are "ranks"
above priest and below bishop.

Also, bishops are one per *diocese*, and the size of those is roughly
set by population. Basicly one per large city or smaller city and
surrounding areas. One reason for this is that it takes a bishop to
ordain a priest.

Archbishops have arch-dioceses. I\'m not so sure about the exact details
of how they differe from bishops.

A level that you definitely left out, but that *does* exist in some of
the related churches (in cluding ones that are technically part of the
Catholic church) is Patriarch. A Patriarch is typically in charge of a
"Rite" or a country. They\'re a step below the Pope in the churches that
recognize the Pope, and co-equal with the Pope in those that don\'t
(they consider him to be the Patriarch of Rome).

> And Monks and Abbots.  Would the latter be similar to enlisted ranks?

No, they are a seperate and somewhat parallel system. Monks (and Nuns)
are in some ways a similar rank to priest. The Abbot/Mother Superior
are somewhat similar to a bishop. And the head of the order is up there
with the cardinals.

I rather suspect that low pop worlds will not get much past Bishop.
They\'d be responsible to a subsector or sector Patriarch. Higher pop
worlds will go clear to Patriarch. And the Patriarchs will be under the
Pope. 

I\'m not sure where to fit in the Cardinals. But the reason for placing
Patriarchs where I do is that they, and not cardinals are empowered to
make rulings on *doctrine*. The Pope can overrule them, but until he
does, it stands. 

I expect that given the area to be covered, the Church would have
cardinals below patriarchs, with the cardinals electing patriarchs, and
the patriarchs electing a Pope (when one is needed).

Fusion isn\'t necessarily all that "clean". The "easier" types all
produce *lots* of neutrons, which tend to make everything in the
vicinity radioactive.

Likewise, fission is *not* necessarily as "dirty" as some would make
out. "High level" waste is, by the laws of physics, *short* half-life
material. That means that the radiation drops off rather quickly with
time. In less than 300 years, "high level" waste is no more radioactive
than the original uranium ore. "Low level" waste isn\'t that radioactive
to start with.

If they\'ve go Imperial permits, a member government had better *not*
try confiscating them. But they *could* force the ship to stay out at
the 100 diameter limit (or wherever it was when they found out about
the nukes), and run it thru the fastest practical refuel and resupply
and make them jump out. And they\'d have made it well known that they
don\'t allow nukes in system. So the only ships bring ing them there
would be misjumps.

Contary to popular belief, the exhaust of a NERVA is *not* radioactive.
It\'s just *very* hot hydrogen. And it\'s not nearly as destructive as,
say, HEPlar. 

As for junking it, such a ship should be quite viable. After all, the
powerplant doesn\'t need to be fueled for years at a time. And it uses
LH2 for propulsion, so that\'s not a problem. 

It will be slower, as to save fuel it\'ll boost from the surface (or
from the highport) into a transfer orbit and coast to the 100 diameter
limit. But not all *that* much slower. 

This sort of thing would either be a "new" ship from a pocket empire
recently contacted by the expanding Imperium, or an *old* ship that
some folks with lots of time and the right skills, but with little
cash, managed to refurbish so they could go trading.

I think there really *ought* to be a small, but conspicuous, percentage
ships encountered that are *old* ship types refitted by folks trying
to get into interplanetary or interstellar trade on the cheap. They\'ll
be most common during periods of major expansion and recontact.

They\'ll be crewed by the *real* "misfits" of the spacelanes, but
they\'ll also take on the *strangest* jobs. 

There are still sailing ships cruising the oceans. And some *aren\'t*
merely personal "toys". Some actually manage a marginal existence in
out of the way places. And they do visit the regular ports from time to
time. The Imperium may have similar "obsolete" tramp freighters.

And then there are always the "collectors". You might get offered a job
ferrying some restored spacecraft from centuries before to its new
home. And the owner wants it done under its own power. And he insists
on coming along. :-)

When I eventually pick up FF&S2 or its successor, I\'m seriously
thinking about designing both "low tech" space ships (I\'ll swipe all
those designs from WW II onward that never got built) and "upgrades" of
such old ships. The upgrades would be examples of ships that a
spacefaring culture that hadn\'t yet discovered jump would havbe and
then "upgrade" after being contacted. It\'s usually cheaper (if
possible) to bolt on a J-drive than to build a new ship.

Given a good design, and good maintenance, it\'s possible to keep using
a ship indefinitely.

This is as close as I could come to the Imperial Light Fighter published
in the T4 Starships book.

A variant of the above design, using the same engines, power plant, etc.
is
available. It has improved lasers and armor. A missile cannister and a
small sandcaster have been added. The G-tank has been removed due to the
now lower performance it is no longer needed. The big defect in this
design
is that the added mass cuts the performance down to about 4 Gs.

True if it requires thrust all the way to the target to hit. But if
your anti-missile system turns the 10-20cm cross section missile
into a cloud of debris a few 10s or more meters across, it becomes
more of a hazard to the target. I think I\'d have my missiles blow up
if any one of a number of critical systems is killed in order to
maximize this...

If this is a lifeboat, it shouldn\'t necessarily be for long-term
habitation, should it?  How about compressed oxygen tanks and/or
a CO2 scrubber, water tanks, insulation around the hull, batteries,
and a simple zero-g toilet that vents into space (solids, liquids
would be recycled).  It would be uncomfortable, but it just needs
to keep people alive until they can be found.

Oh yeah, a very noisy radio broadcaster...

I\'ve been going through my mental list of missiles, and I can\'t think of any
ASM\'s that rely on kinetic kill.  There are some anti-tank, and one runway
denial missiles that I know of, but all of the Anti-Ship Missiles I know of are
focused blast (i.e. shaped charge) dependant for the damage.  I know that this
was a topic of some discussion during a fleet exercise, where several of us were
discussing exactly what we could expect with a live missile kill from CIWS.  The
basic idea being, that even if we killed the missile at the last moment and it
continued (in pieces) to hit the ship, we would have prevented the missile from
striking the ship in such a way as to detonate and focus the blast against the
skin of the ship and this would probably attenuate the damage to the point that
it was acceptable.

the subject of the reactionless Thruster. All of us were smart enough to
realize the problem, so we asked ourselves:

Why does it have to be reactionless? The classic maneuver drive was never
well defined until SOM - it was just "the drive that moves the ship that
doesn\'t take fuel".

Some thought that it must be a gravity drive of some sort, pushing off of
the various gravity gradients of the system it is in. Of course, that
introduces a hiccup in the form of varying performance depending on the
local space-time curvature (read: gravity).

Some of us thought it might be an "exotic particle" drive - that is, some
generated particle is used as the reaction mass. Of course this has the
problem that most such particles wouldn\'t be able to generate the thrust
necessary, since their mass is so small.

Anyone have any ideas on this? My group wants a decent explanation for the
thruster unit (doesn\'t have to be perfect) that fits classic Traveller (our
campaign setting) - thus HEPlaR is out.

That\'s why I asked about the Brilliant Pebbles concept a few days ago. A
KKM that doesn\'t divide into multiple targets at some point is going to be
a pretty easy target for PD lasers.  Admittedly, the missile/debris would
continue along some vector after being hit, but it would probably not be
able to track or change vector.  The really dangerous missiles would be the
big ones like Sam designs that break into multiple independent attack
vehicles (MIAV\'s) at 30-60 kkm, race in as close as possible then explode,
spraying an area with *fast* moving ball bearings.

My question from a few days ago was, didn\'t we decide these "pebbles" would
do significant damage to even heavily armored ships..if they hit?

I\'d like to see the return of the KKE missile, because:

a) I agree with those who has stated that det-laser weapons may fall under
the nuclear weapon category. Could you rig a det-laser to detonate near a
target to get a standard nuke detonation?

b) KKEs were canon in CT and MT...and since I play in the CT universe (with
rules from all four incarnations), I\'d like to see them back.

Interestingly, T4 has implied that det-lasers do fall under the nuclear
weapon category, by stating (in QSDS, I belive) that civilian ships cannot
mount MFDs - which are needed for missiles (unless you get fully independent
missiles). This implies that civilians cannot have missiles, either. This
was not the case in CT - civilian craft could have conventional missiles.

Now, I just gotta work on getting High Energy weapons back onto spacecraft,
and lower the TL of repulsors, and I\'ll be happy :)

A "dirty" part of fission is the transport and disposal. Sure, the
original ore is just as radioactive (even more so, in many cases). But
it\'s *buried* deep beneath the earth. over 300 years is a long time to
make sure those swimming pools stay safe. 

The "dirtyest" part may be the seemingly cavalier attitude taken in the
mining and prospecting of Uranium by major mining corporations and
governments. Like ignoring and whitewashing scientific environmental
panel recommendations, worker dosage limits over ten times international
standards, test drilling over 600 holes into the worlds most
concentrated uranium deposit and leaving them open ... Take it from
somebody who lives in the world\'s largest Uranium producing area:
Saskatchewan, Canada.

Even in the far future such corner cutting and irresponsibilty may be
present.

The same issues exist for anti-missile weaponry as for the anti-ship missiles.  It
does not take any appreciable energy to add random vector changes to the Traveller
drive systems, and still get the missile on target.  In fact, I would tend to
believe that a spiral course would be a standard, it would allow the guidence
sensors a much better look at the target, as well as keeping the missile moving
relative to the target.  Unlike lasers, which must travel in straight lines and are
therefore vulnerable to relatively small clouds such as produced by a sandcaster, a
missile has the ability to manuever and keep maneuvering.  Even a cloud of pellets
several tens of meters across is not going to make a difference when we discuss SOD
missiles maneuvering to a detonation point 10\'s and 100\'s of kilometers away.

Reactive armor (armor plating that explodes outward just prior to missile impact)
may make a difference for conventional, skin-contact missiles - and would cost a
lot less.  But, for thoses missiles, lasers on anti-missile duty are virtually
guarenteed a kill.

  In response to the question about "technobabble" that fits the classic
traveller manuever drive question...

  There will be many different concepts, all with "holes" in them no
matter what you do - since it is a violation of "known physical laws".
One "theory" (read as technobabble) that I developed for reactionless
drives for another game system (GURPS in particular) was that the
Reactionless drive is the primary step needed before you can develope
either warp drives, or FTL drives.  Essentially stated, the maneuver drive
(so spake Hal) is a drive that "thrusts" against both the jumpspace
universe as well as the physical universe.  The "thrust" is in the
jumpspace, but the ship is in the realspace.  I treat the "reactionless"
thruster as a "field effect" with respect to traveller since it is volume
reltated instead of mass related (In CT that is). 
  I like what I saw in the FF&S(2) in that the ships were rated for mass,
and if the mass didn\'t fall within certain parameters, the ship designers
were advised to redesign the ship, or recalculate the actual "G" results
according to realistic physics (something about 10 kNewtons thrust per
cubic meter or something of that nature...

  In any event, I offer the explanation above as a means for your
enjoyment, not as a means for establishing a "canon" explanation that must
be accepted by all <grin>.

In *space*, Doug. In the atmosphere you are correct, but not it space.

A space missile will have kinetic energy (from its closing velocity) higher
than any explosive charge it might pack. If it doesn\'t have that much
velocity it will be destroyed and/or dodged long before it gets near a
ship.  

At least, that\'s how I understand it.

BTW, if the above *is* correct then TP better not play with inertial mass,
or TP\'s are right out for KKM propulsion.

It _is_ a "standard" detonation. The only difference are some metal
rods pointing away from the center of the explosion. So a 500kt
det-laser is a 500kt bomb.

As for nukes being outlawed, I have since decided that the rules of
war forbid "indescriminate attacks against civilian populations."
I changed it (for myself) since there are many other ways to kill
off cities than nukes----rock throwing does the job, and once the
firestorms stop you can even walk around in shirtsleeves (unlike a
radioactive crater).

PLasma and fusion weapons won\'t work at ranges beyond 10s of kms
since the bolts move at around 10km/s (that number has been stated,
but I really don\'t know how (or _if_) the original FFS authors
derived it. A plasma that moves much faster is a traveller ship weapon

Eris is right. A modern missile moves what? Mach 3? Mach 3 is about
a km/s. A space missile in traveller would hit at something like
100km/s. The KE goes as v^2, so the space missile (of the same mass)
has 10,000 times the KE of the modern naval missile.

This leads to another point. Maneuvering the missile is really hard
since it is going so fast, so missiles aren\'t very good at dodging
since they have to set up the intercept vector from pretty far out
at thos kinds of closing velocities. That\'s why non-det-laser
missiles will likely be fragmentation weapons. Bearing ball sized
shot is really nasty at 100km/s (0.5 MJ for a single 0.1
gram bb). Target and missile are coming head on at each other, CVs
of 2-400 km/s wouldn\'t be uncommon (4.5MJ for 300km/s). If the bbs
are more like a gram (00 shot sized) then it goes up by a factor of
10 (linear with mass).

Bb missiles aren\'t as nasty as we originally thought, but are still
good weapons----something that is nice since we can design KKMs
instead of nukes to make things seem more like the good ole days
when our free trader buddies didn\'t have a dozen strategic nukes in
their ship :-)

multi-ton t-plate missiles are another story.

Is the local gravity in-system really that much? 

Suppose, you lose thrust and find yourself too far from any planetary

The consensus was that any reasonably point defence system - or even
a single civilian laser turret - can guarantee a hit on such a missile
well before it impacts, so they\'re only useful against unarmed targets or
if you can overwhelm the target\'s point defence with a big swarm. SInce
thruster plates (or even fusion/Heplar) are so expensive, it\'s hard to
make the big swarm cost-effective. It\'s even harder for impact missiles if 
ships have dedicated point defence lasers - I had a FFS1 3-dTon ultra-rapid
fire point defence laser that could take down 50 missiles even if they
were 100-G maneuver and all arrived simultaneously. One subtext is that maybe
military ships should have  better point defence than the "canon" designs
do, but that\'s a lesser issue.

I have some FFS2-style rules for explosive chemical laser missiles - sort of 
a non-nuke version of the x-ray detlaser missile, for people who don\'t thikn
civilians should own nukes.

- -if you want to be on a vector such that when the missile blows up the
fragments hit the target, you\'ve severley restricted the ability of the
missile to evade - it\'ll get hit at much longer range, giving the 
target time to get out of the way of the debris cloud. (In practice there
will be a complex dance between the PD laser and the missile, as the
tiny missile brain trys to trade off ability to hit target vs evasion...but
lasers in Traveller are so good it\'s hard for the missile to win.
The same thing applies to submunition missiles - if you deploy abunch of
BB\'s you have to do it at just the right time, and you\'ve made youself
predictable while lining up for the deployment. "Brillian pebbles" smart
submunitions are similar, since you can\'t get a decent amount of delta-V
onto a small submunition (though it occurs to me I forgot to give the AND
drive a minimum size...)

- -big, armoured missiles with BB warheads (Sam\'s favourites) have some 
promise - but to hit the target they have to trade enough evasion in that
they can be easily hit by conventional (non-PD) big lasers. You can 
overhewlm the big lasers with multiple missiles - but if I recall correctly,
Sam\'s big death missile cost MCr100; you can buy a lot of defensive laser
capacity for that money. 

- -the range at which a laser can\'t miss a missile-sized target is about
5000 km for a 100-G missile; it scales weakly with size and acceleration,
so it\'s about 20000 km for a big 10-G missile. A 150 mJ ROF-100 
laser will get quite a few shots in...

(And, of course,one good counter to impact KKMs is impact counter-KKMs.)

Overall, if you do the numbers, KKM\'s don\'t fit "classic" traveller very well;
they do overwhelming amounts of damage but hit very rarely. The det-lasers
(aside from their association with nukes) actually resemble the "classic"
traveller missile (moderate amount of damage, moderately hard to shoot down)
much better.

In live firing tests of CIWS on a barge and other platforms they found that
fragments from a *hit* ASM missiles fired at the target, tended to cause
damage to structural items not protected very well, in one case waveguides
were rendered inop for vital radar systems. 

The term used was *soft kill*, meaning the target ship was not sunk but
damaged to a degree that its ability to preform its missions(ASW, AAW etc)
was reduced or rendered nonfunctional beyond ship\'s repair parties to
overcome. Net result the target ship will need to be placed in a ship yard
to repair the damage. Kinda like wounding a soldier rather than killing the
soldier, more resources/people needed to tend the wounded. In some ways
this was USN triple thinking at its *best*.<G> Rather than wait for some
nation to build a *soft kill* missile, they built a *defense* first. Net
result no *soft kill* missiles were built.

The USN decided that placing aluminum *armor* over what they considered
vital areas such mast waveguides, CIC walls, etc based upon data that the
USN had acquired from sources. The only obvious things that were over
looked was that the radar antennae were not so protected, just an oversight? 

In traveller the KKM may not penetrate the ships armor but the sensor and
communication arrays are scrubbed off, rendering the ship blind, deaf, and
mute. Such a ship will be able to effectively engage any target. After s
good KKM *scrubbing* it\'s PD\'s will be blind to any more incoming
*goodies*. Wave attacks for missiles are a good thing.<G>

bruce,

What was the pen value for your 3dt PD laser?

What was the max range the PD could begin firing?

What was its ROF to engage 50 missiles at 100g\'s

How long were you letting the missiles accel, over what distance?

I tend to doubt the ability of such a PD system to effectively stop such a
missile swarm at such accelerations?

A what if then, could it stop 50 missiles at 30 G\'s accel for one hour each
dispensing 1000 ultradense 10mm balls?

The "Official" explanation is:

manner [than contragravity], basically by \'grabbing\' on to it."  (FF&S p65)

 When the choice is to use the batteries at a rate of  1-4 days for life
support, or 1-4 weeks (months?) for low berth power...I\'ll probably crawl into
the low berth.

But I\'m not sure....  ;)

Thanks for the great info.  Much appreciated.

I think I\'ll keep monks/nuns as parallel to enlisted ranks, with the other
titles as officer parallels.

Thus:

Novice
Initiate
Regular Monk (Brother/Sister )
Master
Abbott/Abbess/Mother Superior

"Ordainment" would replace the idea of a Commission.

Acolyte
Deacon
Priest -
Monsignor - large churches/church administration
Bishop - regions / lopop system
Arch-Bishop - system
Cardinals - sub-sector
Patriarch - sector
Pope - whole church


Hmm.  This still needs work.  I want to have a Chaplain and the monk/nun
system needs some thinking.

When I get something finally worked out, I\'ll put up a webpage.

	What... you mean that there\'s any doubt out there that the 3I
_wasn\'t_ like this from day 1?  I\'ve always seen it as exactly this way...

	And yes, I\'m back.  I was cut off from civilization by this massive
ice storm that blacked out half of Quebec.  We lost power for ten days and
phone for somewhat more and had to move in with my brother-in-law.

	Amazingly, despite the fact that the weather dipped towards -30 for
a couple of nights, only about half a dozen hypothermia deaths have been
reported so far.  OTOH, carbon monoxide poisonings numbered in the
hundreds...  go figure.

News Item, Imperial Big Guns Magazine, Imperial Gun Expo Special Issue,

"Famille Spofulam Goes Small!


	FSA\'s booth at the biennial IGE is traditionally a crowd-pleaser;
the Spofulams can be relied upon to introduce one or two ludicrously large,
high-powered, and evil-looking tools of ill omen.  This year, however, the
centerpiece of their display was devoted not to some outsized implement of
mass destruction, but rather to three weapons that collectively, probably
weigh less than any one of FSA\'s previous offerings.

	That\'s right... for the first time in their history, Famille
Spofulam have built a body pistol.  And, being themselves, they also are
offering to the public for the first time something they call a "Body
ShotSMG", as well as a little monstrosity they call a "Body Minigun".
That\'s right... a 6-barreled VRF submachinegun that measures less than 30
cm with its stock folded and which fires 2500 3mm HE rounds a minute.

	I was given the chance to handle the Body Pistol MK 1, as FSA has
prosaically designated it.  It measures a compact 12 cm overall, weighs
only 145 grams fully loaded, and is configured as a standard pistol rather
than sporting one of the exotic disguises  beloved of entertainment dramas.
Its concealability results from its compact size and 100% advanced material
construction.  While the absence of disguise may make its purpose
completely obvious, it allows the use of a grip magazine to hold 23 6 mm X
8 caseless rounds, and this in turn allows burst-fire capability.
Stylistically, it is a smooth, dark grey, sleek-looking little weapon that
is surprisingly inexpensive.  While traditional Spofulam aficionados may
find it a trifle small to adequately compensate for their shortcomings, I\'m
sure that it will find a market niche among those who don\'t need to walk
around with 9-kg 15mm gauss pistols strapped to their hips.

	The other two new Spofulam offerings were demonstrated at FSA\'s IGE
press conference.  After the usual FSA buffet and wet bar (thankfully,
their new "small-is-better" philosophy has yet to extend to their press
perks), Hengabar Spofulam himself, dressed in a formal one-piece and cape,
strode to the podium.  After a few humorous introductory remarks about FS\'s
newly forged "strategic alliance" with the Sayat Concourse\'s SayBOOM and
SayVROOM, he proceeded with a startling demonstration of the "RoomSweeper",
as FSA have named what they claim to be the smallest autoshotgun currently
in production.

	Without warning, an Imperial Standard Ballistic Testing Dummy
(whose features, as usual, strongly resembled Sir Arameth Gridlore\'s)
trundled in from stage left, brandishing a large rock in an upraised hand.
Mr. Spofulam, with a truly dramatic sneer, whirled, cape flaring, and drew
a short, albeit bulky weapon sporting fore-and-aft pistol grips from a
holster hidden in the small of his back.  A transparent bulletproof shield
slammed down, presumably to protect the audience from stray pellets or Mr.
Spofulam getting carried away, and Mr. Spofulam opened fire.

	While the effects were not as spectacular as those of their OKA-SQ
multi-barrel vehicle-mounted autoshotgun, they were nevertheless
impressive; 10 12-pellet 18 X 56 mm rounds produced a large number of holes
in the ISBTD.  As he ejected the magazine, Mr. Spofulam noted that a number
of magazine options were available; the just-demonstrated 10-round box for
high-concealability applications, as well as a 20-round banana-mag and a
30-round drum.  He then proceeded to load one of the 30-round drums,
previously concealed in the podium, and emptied it into the ISBTD, with
predictably messy results.

	In this writer\'s opinion, however, the larger magazine options
defeat the purpose of the RoomSweeper; this should be completely obvious
from the fact that it is only 33 cm long and has a 12.4 cm barrel.
Clearly, the weapon is intended to be light and marginally concealable (at
the expense of range and lethality), and the larger magazines would defeat
these advantages.  Should greater volume of fire be required, the smart
shooter will simply use a larger autoshotgun.

	Following the ShotSMG demonstration, the press conference then
adjourned to the pistol range, where Miss Wiiniipiita Spofulam proceeded to
demonstrate the "Buzzsaw Body Minigun".  The pert and adorable adolescent
strode up to the shooting stand carrying a rather deformed-looking weapon.
A partial shroud conceals most of the Buzzsaw\'s six barrels.  It sports
twin pistol grips, the hindmost one accepting the feed from a surprisingly
compact 2500-round belt-pack cassette, and a folding stock complete with
shock absorber folds over the top.  The whole weapon, being less that 27 cm
long, presented a stocky and somewhat ugly appearance.

	Then, Miss Spofulam proceeded to demolish a long series of targets
one by one.  While the Buzzsaw\'s 3mm round is hardly high-powered, it can
certainly fire a lot of them; what the weapon lacks in stopping power it
certainly makes up for in volume of fire and psychological effect; it
sounds rather like the devil\'s own dentist drill, and the use of tracer
ammunition makes it look more like an exotic energy weapon than anything
else.  And with a full minute\'s worth of sustained fire from one cassette,
it gives the shooter ammo enough not only to clear their sequence of
targets, but to finish off by writing "Winnie was here" in longhand script
on the range ceiling..."

Is that where you leach guano?  Why don\'t you post it, I\'m sure it would be

Dear God.  I just got a crystal-clear mental picture of hordes of juvenile

It is enough out to c. 2,000 AU (c. 1,000,000 light seconds).

Don\'t forget the stellar diameters.

No, the thrust just drops to c. 1% of the amount within the 2,000 AU limit.

A T-plate equipped ship could actually transverse the distance between the
various stars in a
multi-star system (bianaries and trianaries mostly).

Bruce,
Some nits to pick 

1. Bubba carries not only KKM BB\'s but nukes also. 
2. The typical PD will not smudge Bubba\'s paint job, let alone damage Bubba. 
3. Bubba is not disposable, it is reusable submunitons carrier. 
4. Bubba\'s evasion was very high but not as high as Little Bubba.
5. Bubba also can release the submunitons at outside the PD lasers eff range.
6. Does not matter how many *cheaper* PD\'s you have if they are not
*effective* against the incoming targets, learn to breath vacuum.<G>
7. KKM\'s can do a *soft kill* against a target, damaging or destroying Heat
Radiators, Sensor and Communications arrays, and damaging any PD\'s that are
firing which then exposes them to possible damage.
8. Missiles can use a similar tactic that some current AT missiles use like
"Bill" and I think "Tank Breaker" pass nearby(overhead) and fire a warhead
into the target(top).

My *favorite* is well blended mix of missiles, Det Nukes, KKM\'s and Area
Detonation Nukes.
That makes it harder for one type of PD laser to be effective against all
incoming missiles and submunitions.

>5000 km for a 100-G missile; it scales weakly with size and acceleration,
>so it\'s about 20000 km for a big 10-G missile. A 150 mJ ROF-100 
>laser will get quite a few shots in...

????How fast can the above PD acquire, track and FCS to hit such a incoming
missile?

If the incoming missile is traveling at 100 G\'s for half an hour, its
*range rate* will be such that at the PD extreme range will have
microfractions of a second before the missile is out of the FCS envelope.
Multiplying this by several missiles, your PD will not have time to react,
track, and FCS all of the incoming missiles before they are on target.

Your example seems to indicate a *best* case for the PD, ie you know it is
coming and is just waiting for it to get into firing range.

Define big? the RCS for Bubba is a lot smaller than it\'s displacement will
indicate. That is using an old striker loop hole. As I was told "An
undocumented feature".<G>

Off the top of my head the armor that Bubba has is equal over 1,000 in
FFS2. I don\'t think your 150Mj Laser ROF 100 will not have much effect.

>(And, of course,one good counter to impact KKMs is impact counter-KKMs.)

Yes I agree, but you can also use area det nukes too.

Overall the current T4 FFS2 or FFS1 does not fit "Classic" traveller
either, heat radiators, log type sensors etc. <G>

Bruce,

It looks I will have to incorporate the *good* features of your DSR into
the Bubba line, ie military black, improved masking et al.

The TP generates a small gravity well, which it then pushs off of (or 
falls into, based upon your take on it). It can swing that well about 
(allowing for you to manuver with out changing facing to much). When 
a ship needs to dock, it realies on it\'s manuvering thrusters after 
generating the needed vector with it\'s TP (we do not want a small 
gravity well slinging about in our docking bay) or it uses the 
gravity well of the object or some other large nearby object (star or 
planet) to push off of/fall into.

I also agree with MT, in that there should be a min. size to the 
units.

	Hm...  you running for understatement of the month?  It deprived
over three million people of electricity in the dead of winter.  Amazingly
enough, there\'s been little looting here, however.  The fact that there are
a bunch of Canadian Forces troops policing the blacked out areas has
helped; the Somalia scandal is probably scaring would-be looters..:).

	Not surprised.  Large areas of Montreal were without power for over
a week.  The South Shore is still largely in the dark, and an area running
down to the US border has been dubbed the "Triangle of Darkness" by the
local media.  They will be without power for another week at least.  Rural
Eastern Ontario has been badly hit as well and there are still a lot of
people without power.  The local news doesn\'t say a lot about upstate New
York, but apparently they\'re in prety deep trouble too.

	I\'ve seen footage of this on the news; Brossard (a suburb of
Montreal on the south shore of the St-Lawrence) has two honking big CN
diesels (I think one is a geep although I could be wrong) sitting on the
street outside the Town Hall.  They hoisted them off the tracks with a
honking big crane, set them down, and fired them up.  Basically, diesel
locos are honking great big generators on wheels... the major problem was
apparently just stepping down the current.

	So basically, if the stuff is at a printer in upstate NY, don\'t
wait by the mailbox..:\\

Is it true, in your knowledge, that the Vilani are responsible for the

Well, closer examination shows that in fact, a Solomani-style sector has
only a 32 x 40 grid, so there isn\'t a hex #70 in the y-axis.  Suspicious,
don\'t you agree?  What are they trying to hide?

Hm.  One of our comrades has been seeking tutoring in the male/female
dichotomy already, here at core.  What are your rates like?  She\'s paying
something like Cr50/hour right now, I seem to recall.  Do your tutors also
include those hot oil massages?

that both they (the Sayat) as well as "Slimies" such as myself are
monosexual, we do reproduce sexually.  Not with other species, of course!
No, no, no.  But it requires two individuals to produce new spawn.  Or an
infant, in the case of our Sayat comrades, I mean.

And what do you make of the threat represented by this little tidbit of
Solomani sector numerology (besides the red herring of 4x4 subsectors): the
maximum number of allowable jump points within a sector are 1280, or 5 *
4^4.  Eh?

So you believe, then, that nonhuman polities are an _additional_ factor in

As someone that spent 3 years on a Aircraft Carrier, my guess would be the
fact that some ships are cities in their own right.  An Aircraft Carrier is
quite literally a floating city with one main purpose.  The same would
undoubtably be true of any sufficiently large Starship.

I hope that this will be of interest. Please give me some feed-back.
Per your request here is the current hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church.
(with side notes)

Top down.

Pontiff - Head of the Church

Patriarch - divided in major and minor status. Several of the minor
patriarchies are now titular or nominally (honorary)

Cardinal - The highest rank in the Church. A military equivelant would be
general and as with generals there are several degrees. These are as
follows. Please also note that in the absence of a pontiff a senior
Cardinal - The Camerlengo or Cardinal- Protector who frequently functions a
the chief of staff for the pontiff acts as temporary head of the church
until a new pontiff is selected.
Cardinal
Cardinal - Bishops
Cardinal - Priests
Cardinal - Deacons

Bishops - These are the princes of the Church and run the organization. They
come in two flavors. These are ranked according to the size and
responsibility and importance of the dioscese involved.
Arch-bishop
Bishop
(Auxiliary Bishop) Sort of breveted bishop. Similar in concept to the
British Army\'s Brigadier. They are frequently assigned a Titular or nominal
see for official purposes.
There is also a rank called - Vicar - Apostolic which is sort of a temporary
Bishop who
governs over an area or territory in the name of the Pontiff until a formal
diosese can be estabished and a bishop assigned.

Pastor - This is the basic priest. Leader of a parish. The minor orders
leading up to the rank of pastor are:
porter
reader
exorcist and finally
acolyte.


These are the normal direct chain of command for the church. However there
are several ranks and offices which directly impact this chain. These are
Metropolitan - within each provice or dioscee there may be multiple see(s)
"cathedral cities." each which would possess at the minumum an auxiliary
bishop. The senior bishop and his see (or cathedral) would be the
Metropolitan. He may also be an
Arch-bishop though this is relatively rare.

Primate - Head of the Church with in a nation. Usually a cardinal of some
middle to high rank. Can be an Arch-bishop.

Legate -     Senior non-attached officers of the Church. They may be
monsignori, Bishops or Cardinal. Charged with great power and authority -
usually temporarily
these are the fire-men for the church. Direct representatives of the Pontiff
Prothontaries - Apostolic. These are often senior prelates of the church
who assist in the administration of the day to day operations of the church.
The various ranks indicate the hierarchy of these prelates and the value of
the stipends that they recieve.
1. "de numero participantium"
2. "supernumerary"
3. "ad instar"
4. "titular"
Chamberlain - title of distinction grantes to members of the clergy for
service and to provide recognition of service. May also be a member of the
Pontiff\'s personal household.
Monsignor - Also a title of distinction grantes to members of the clergy for
service and to provide recognition of service. More common than chamberlain.
Chancellor - Title given to priests in administrative service in individual
dioscees as
senior financial and administrative officer.
Dean - Administrative officer within a dioscese may be charged with
operating a college or particular enterprise for the church.
Provost - frequently charged with operation of religious schools.
Canon - the senior priest or prelate charged with the actual operations of a
cathedral

Abbot - Head of a religious order. May or may not have several priory\'s
involved. Usually granted jurisdiction over entire order. If an order
possesess
multiple abbeys then the senior most abbey\'s abbot would be the leader.
An alternative title for the head of some monastic orders is Archimandrite.
Prior - head of a smaller religous community perhaps subordinate to an
abbey. May be stand alone.
Father - General - Head a very large religious order with a wide variety of
sites
and activities. Ex. the Jesuit Order and the Benedictines
Friar - Ordinary Member of a religious order who has attained priestly
status.
Friar - Minor - Usually members of mendicant or wandering order. Rarely has
status of a priest. May also be referred to as mendicant brothers.
Monk - Ordinary member of a religious order who has not attained priestly
status.
Lay Brother - Has taken some vows but not irrevocable ones.
Hermit - a religious who has chosen to sequester him or herself from
population. Usually in very isolated areas.

Abbess, Prioress, Mother Superior as above for female orders.

This is only a summary and a fairly abridged one. Please let me know what
you all think.

Thanks

I\'ve used the article as basis for my own starport designs and therefore I
had to come up with a reason for those HUGE runways (or any runways for
that matter).
The Subsidized merchant (the winged one from Traders & Gunboats) I decided
to be a pretty common ship and then I started designing it. I gave it
contragrav that would lift the ship if it was 20% loaded or less. Then I
gave it a fusion thruster with airscoops to keep the fuel consumtion (and
heat of exhaust) down while moving inside an atmosphere. Ths ship can take
off and land as other gravvehicles when not loaded but with a full load it
needs a runway to land/takeoff. As these and similar ships are quite common
in the Traveller universe most starports have runways esp. since the worls
having the starport generally is the subsider of the ship and could
therefore force the starport builder to include runways.
The ship actually got quite a lot cheaper as (in my design system)
contragrav and gravthrusters are the main powergobblers and by reducing the
powerneed a smaller powerplant could be used.

It was a flare but a mighty big one as the Darrian sourcebook gave it a
spherical EMP (whatever) shockwave that killed all electronics/gravitics(!)
for several parsecs around the star. Darrian sourcebook also contradicts
most of the Darrian writeup (by John M Ford?) in an early JTAS.

I especially disliked the Trekky cover of the sourcebook, pointed ears and all.

Most privately owned missiles in my Universe explode prior to contact to
maximize hit propability and even more importantly, to scrub of all sensor
antenna facing the missile.
No civilian ships are allowed to own neutrino sensors and massdetectors
except for research purposes and then only after getting a license. Most
military ship rely on neutrino sensors as they can be put under the armour.
My massdetectors has to be outside the armour for handwaving reasons.

You have a point there. My spacecombat system uses 1000 km squares with
typical ranges at say 10 000 km and sensors that detects at 50 000 km or
less when dealing with normal traders and stuff. A typical missile (50 kg
as per canon) hits with say 3 squares per gameturn (5 min) and this
produced just the right amount of penetration and damage for personal
ships. When your detection figures came up I tried to change the scales
which worked nicely (change laser wavelenghts to soft x-ray) and allow
smaller fusion engines for the missiles but the missiles were now
shipkillers.

One note about KK penetration though: When impact velocity goes beyond
about 5000 m/s penetration start behaving like a HE blast ie pen prop to
the cuberoot of kinetic energy instead of being proportional to it. In my
combat system this made matters worse actually because the high pen of
missiles resulted in most of the energy going through the target (if the
target was small).

Neutrinos work fine for that and if you simply could change matter into
neutrinos you\'d also have a very nice cooling device.

No way - then I have to scratch my "loose homing missile" random encounter

If people start uparmouring missiles, then PD weapons will get heavier.
It\'s an evolutionary thing. Uparmoured missiles are also either slower or
bigger and more expensive, and thus more vulnerable to missiles in a
counter-missile role.

I cant remember. How many gees could it pull ?

A TL12 laser with a 1m focal array has an effective range of 25 000 km. 2m
focal array takes this up to 100 000 km.

Hmmm, you are talking surface damage there ... but I still think either
your point defense will stop the warhead or it wont. And if the KKM hits, I
think that the effect will be greater than sandpapering the ship\'s skin.

Point defense is a job for a combination of nuclear dampers, sand, missiles
and PD lasers. There may even be a role for a point defense Meson Gun ...
and I\'m not too proud to use a spinal mount against a missile that is a big
enough threat.

I also believe that point defense lasers should be 250 MJ. Anti-ship lasers
should be maxed out ie TL*50 MJ. Overcome your peak power output limit by a
nice big battery.

With a TL12 computer, fairly well I think.

30 minutes at acceleration of 100 Gees is 1 km/s * 60 * 30 = 1800 km/s.
Fast, but the missile will be in "the zone" for long enough, I think.

Military sensors at TL12 are good enough to show most anything up at quite
long range. Even 1cm^3 ball bearings.

Personally, I dont think that it is worthwhile to try and hide in deep
space through masking and stuff, so I\'d just have the LIDAR or AEMS turned
on all the time on a warship.

Nuhh. No way, no how. Things in space have an effective cross-section
according to their displacement. Unless you want to recalculate all
cross-sections according to maneuver, all the time, or let ships maneuver
in any direction.

And if we do that, we have the "nose towards enemy and armoured to 30m
thickness" problem.

Hmmmm... A nice idea. And for the "blinding/crippling" missile, one 
could use LOTS of, say, superdense 0.01 g balls.

This way, one could get a really big cloud, more like a sandcaster 
on a missile...

I think you\'re in danger of making the same mistake that was originally
made with military and noble ranks (IMO, of course). An organisation of
a given size requires a given number of ranks. There\'s some flexibility
in this, of course, and the number of ranks required differs according
to the purpose and organisation of the organisation (an ugly sentence,
I can\'t think of any synonyms). Anyway, when you want to \'translate\' an
organisation that you know from Earth into interstellar equivalents, you
can\'t just take the same table of ranks and, say, multiply their area
of responsibility by some order of magnitude. If it takes 10 officer
ranks to manage a national fleet on Earth today, you may, by stretching
things a bit here and there, manage to get away with 10 ranks for a
planetary navy. But you cannot, IMO, get away with 10 ranks for an
whole multi-sector navy. (Let me elaborate a bit on this. You might get
away with using only the same number of ranks, but then some of the
ranks would be subdivided. Take for instance some Napoleonic era navies
where there were only one rank for a ship\'s captain. They had a number
of different pay scales depending on the size of the ship, and a captain
with such and such a seniority could expect to be assigned to a ship of
appropiate size (and pay). The French had several different captains
(Captain-of-Sloop, Captain-of-Frigate, etc.).

Anyway, to get back to the matter at hand. As an organisation expands off
Earth I think you can expect some changes in the ranks. For military
organisations I\'d expect additions on top (Fleet Admiral, Force Admiral
(subsectors), Grand Admiral (sectors), etc.). For the Catholic Church I
expect they\'d have to keep the Pope as the top rank, so they\'d split up
existing ranks or introduce new ones.

How about Primate for the Head of Church on a planet big enough to have
more than one Arch-bishop?

Here\'s a suggestion:

Bishop		    Diocese; Worlds with less than 100,000 people is a
		    single diocese.
Arch-bishop	    Arch-diocese (2-10 dioceses (may be a number of small
		    worlds). Worlds with less than 1 million people is a
		    single arch-diocese.
Primate		    World of more than 1 million people. Also courtsy title
		    for bishops and arch-bishops who are head of church on
		    smaller worlds.
Sub-sector primate
Sector primate
Pope

Or you could take an alternate spelling of primate (Primas) and make that
a separate rank.

Couldn\'t the well be a temporary phenomenea? Sort of like recurring

you means you have to walk back to pick it up - again and again. OTOH,
if such a gravity well makes you the equ. of a small planetoid or star,

What is this gravity well? What if I decide to move Pluto near Mercury?

 As far as I know, it would continue to exist; a star could go nova more 
than once, it\'s not a destructive process (opposite to supernova). 
Anyway, I suppose that the planets orbiting that star would be devastated

FOUNDED ON BOTH HARD AND SOFT SCIENCE
Traveller is founded on the sciences: technological science and social
science. Each adds realism to the systems universe while enhancing its
adventure potential.

Technological Science Provides A Foundation
The technological basis for Traveller provides a common ground from which all
extrapolations and story ideas can spring.
The Jump Drive. The secret of interstellar travel is the jump drive. While in
normal space, travel is limited to the speed of light (and it takes years to
go from one star to another), jump drive leaps around space: a jump covers one
parsec (3.26 light years; the average distance between stars) in about a week.
Improved ships can reach speeds of more than 1,000 times the speed of light.

Jump Drive is a foundational concept that makes interstellar travel easy to
accomplish and easy to understand. Behind the mumbo-jumbo is a basic idea that
can be conveyed visually or through simple conversations between crewmembers.

Communication Limited To The Speed Of Transportation. But the universe is so
vast that even the mega-speeds of jump drive cant work miracles. No one has
yet (or ever) invented a hyper communicator that will send messages faster
than light -speed. Communication is limited to the speed of transportation; a
message to the edge of the empire needs to be carried there. For an empire 300
parsecs to the border that message takes more than a year to deliver, even
under the best of circumstances. News of war, conflict, invasion, disaster, or
even peace takes just as long to get back to the center of government.
Consequently folks governing "out there" have a lot of independence. A war can
be over before the news of it reaches the Capital--and orders return--so,
Dukes and Archdukes have to act on their own. Commanders of ships (exploring
or warring) have a lot of independence as well. The characters have to think
on their own--if they work for a merchant company, opening new markets, they
can\'t "phone home" every time negotiations break down--and on the other hand,
the company needs to accept all sorts of wacky contracts and situations!

Restricted communication speeds mean that characters at great distance from
their bosses are free to act as they wish. Characters without the restrictions
of bosses are also thrown on their own initiative.

A Spectrum of Available Technology. Technology is not evenly distributed
throughout the universe; instead, world and cultures can be classified by
their achieved technology level. 
The technology available includes alternatives to traditional or normally
expected technology, but radical deviations from "normal" technology are rare
and unusual encounters.

Allowing for different levels of technology permits players many different
alternatives in how they approach situations.

Gravity Manipulation. The advance of technology has resulted in practical
methods of gravity manipulation. Gravity manipulation expresses itself in
three ways: as artificial gravity, as inertial dampers, and as lifters.
Artificial gravity is built into the deck plates of starships, rendering a
natural environment most like that of a planet surface. Inertial dampers
eliminate the extremes of inertia which can pull and push people and equipment
as it maneuvers. Although such dampers are imperfect, they do allow a normal
environment on starships as they maneuver, and they allow extreme physical
maneuvers on small craft as they perform high-G maneuvers. Lifters are the
final aspect of gravity manipulation: they negate gravity and make it possible
for ships (and other vehicles) to move more easily within a gravitational
field. Lifters operate effectively only near large masses. They are
ineffective (and arent really needed anyway) in deep space.

Grav Plates, Inertial Compensators, and Lifters are included because they make
it easier for players to conceptualize the actions of their characters, and
because dramatic renderings of actions are realistic if they simply show
people standing up.

Thrusters. Thrusters move vehicles forward without the necessity of reaction
mass (as required for rockets). Thrusters work like rockets, but without the
requirements for large amounts of rocket fuel.

Thrusters make easy movement between worlds possible. The detail to which
players want to go in using thrusters is up to them. Detail without purpose is
avoided.

Fusion Power. Cheap fusion power means that the inhabitants of this universe
are not tied to gas stations or complex fuel systems. Hydrogen taken from
water, ice, even the methane of gas giants like Jupiter is all that is
required to produce abundant electricity. Once a culture rises to the minimum
required tech level, its cities depend on electricity produced by efficient,
pollution free fusion power. Starships draw their fuel from the worlds they
visit.

Cheap fusion power simplifies adventuring by eliminating the need for routine
refuelling on world surfaces. At the same time, the concept allows fueling
requirements to be inserted where they add to the adventure situation.

Yes but after a bit of up powering PD weapons to pen the armored missile,

It still can but the chance of hitting is reduced, unless the *range rate*

I though the TL*50 involved the ability of the focal array to handle the

It is not just the computer the PD has to acquire, track, FCS, and engage,
then repeat also having to bring the PD\' laser array into firing position,
and the ship bring the PD to bear on targets outside the firing arc of the PD.

Almost correct, recalc the missiles final built up *velocity* *speed* after
accel for 30 minutes at 100 G\'s. It will be a lot faster than you have above.

I get 3,599 km/s final *velocity* *speed* *range rate*. If it quits accel
and then travels for another minute the distance it would travel is
215,940km, well outside the minimum detection range.

Never give your enemy and easy time tracking you by being active all the
time. I can just keep shooting at you with ARM type missiles and never give
my location to you active ship.

The shape of the object will have an effect on its RCS or now the
SCS(sensor cross section)
If 100 dt box type object is traveling at you it will have a SCS of 10, a
100 dt needle coming at you, point at you, will have a SCS or less than the
box yes?

Bubba does not use superdense armor it uses electromorhopic synthetics(sp).

There is still a significant amount of trade carried out in the Indian
Ocean on dhows, small <murphl>-rigged (big triangular sail) single mast
sailing ships. Many have been motorized, but still rely on sail a lot,
depending on how reliable the engine is. They are still built the same way
they were in the 1200\'s.

Michael Palin crossed from Africa to India on one in "Around the world in
80 days"

Also don\'t forget outfits like "Barefoot Cruises" They and a number of
operators like them run three masters around the Caribbean, carrying
tourists around in 18th century style. (with modern wet bars, galleys and
facilities, of course)

I agree with Leonard, there will always be a scattering of truly ancient
designs floating about.

Inertial compensation is a different system.  T-plates are not inertialess
drives, only "reactionless" which is a misnomer.  There is a reaction, it\'s
just not caused by spewing exhaust out the back end.  Cancelling vectors
requires some work and won\'t happen by accident.  You don\'t just turn off
the T-plates and resume your original vectors.  Each change you\'ve made will
be cumulative, even after T-plate shut down.

It is possible.  But to move a planet requires a much larger gravity well,
and you\'d better be a zillionaire if you want to fund it yourself.

First find the mass of Pluto, then build a T-plate large enough to move the
planet, then build an observatory to make sure you\'re going where you want
to go, then build housing for the staff required to administer what you
have, then build a power plant to power the T-plates, sensors and housing
(don\'t forget the engineers for the T-plates when you build your housing),
then move Pluto where ever you want.  :-)

I think neutrino detectors would be lucky to know there is a close
star. I guess if you have an array of them you can get a
direction...

I never like d the idea of neutrino homing missiles since it opens a
can of worms. Not the least of which is that if you can interact
with neutrinos to detect them, why not use it as shielding?

rating, one for each major science.  This morning, I have
thought of something cognate to character skill levels.

Thus, my TL6 world might be:

Egvinus        0102 C876543-6 S  Ni Ag Med+2		821

....indicating that the world is at medical TL-8.

Since the trade classifier section is already tight, this should
only be used when absolutely necessary.

Implication: if the medical TL is dependent on the overall TL as
shown above, then a drop in overall TL will affect medical TL
unless precautions were taken.

Whaddaya think?

You\'re free to do what you like in your universe but in my Traveller
universe neutrino detectors get a major improvement at TL 13+ but they\'re
still way to big for mounting on missiles.

You should be ashamed, don\'t you know how to use a web search tool?

V=AT^2

or Velocity equals Acceleration times Time, Squared.

My Physics doesn\'t tell me if it matters, but I remember this formula
definitely works when units are V in Meters/sec, Accel in Meters per sec
per sec (aka per sec squared) and Time is in seconds.

So lessee

A = .4G which is 4m/sec^2  (I hope I remember correctly that 1G=10 m/s^2)
T = 32 hours, or 115,200 seconds.

V = 4*115,200^2

V = 4*13,271,040,000

V = 53,084,160,000 m/s or 53,084,160 km/sec or 14,745 km/hour

Adds up quick, no?

It was optimized for defending against normal missiles, so the pen

50 shots per second (the highest allowed for lasers in FFS1), so it 
could get 50 100-G missiles that had had one BL turn to accelerate. 
(This was in the Old Days, so I was more worried about HEPlaR than
thrusters.) It used various other clever tricks like battery power, 
so it couldn\'t sustain its max ROF for a full turn - just for 2000 shots.

That depends on the range they deploy their BB\'s, of course; for reasonable/
physical explosives I can\'t remember what the deployment range is. If they
deploy inside the can\'t miss range (about 6000 km for 30 G 0.5-dTon missiles)
it\'ll get about 10 missiles for every 1000km they travel before deploying.
If they deploy outside that range it becomes a more complicated 
tradeoff...the laser isn\'t particularly optimized for long-range big BB
missiles. Of course, since the laser costs about 1/5th what even a small
T-plate missile does, it doesn\'t need to kill very many to be cost-effective...
and big missiles are vulnerable to the main laser battery.

[Try to answer this buy Peter deleted]

I think Peter was wrong on this one. The right formula is

V = AT + V0 

where V is velocity (m/s), A is acceleration (m/s^2), T is time (s) and
V0 is velocity at start of acceleration (m/s). What Peter gave was the
formula for distance travelled.

Now we get

 V = 4m/s^2 * 32 * 60 * 60s = 460800 m/s = 460.8 km/s = 1.658.880 km/h

Be aware that Peter also slipped in the transition from m/s to m/h. (I
think :-)

I hope not, depending on how big you think Yamato is compared to Traveller
ships.

At 70,000 tons (displacement of water, of course, not L-HYD), and 862 feet
(263m) the Yamato would be 2.06 inches long at 1:5000.  Not very mighty, eh?

My cousin has 1:1200 models that would be pretty fun for mini combat.  That
would make Yamato 8.6 inches long.  Probably the biggest thing on the
board, but then again, it was, wasn\'t it?

Perhaps the 1:2400 scale would be best? 4.3 inches is still big for a hex,
but the smaller ships would still be visible to the naked eye at least.

Final velocity equals acceleration times time, plus initial velocity

For 0.4G, and 32 hours:
v = 4 m/sec^2 * 115200 sec

Sorry, you\'ve forgotten your high school physics too.
Position x goes as the square of time , i.e. x = xo vo*t +(1/2)*g*t^2.
Where vo is the starting velocity and xo is the starting position.
Velocity is the derivative of that, i.e. v = vo + g*t.

The way you had it the units are wrong. Notice that velocity v (= meters/sec)
is equal to the product  acceleration times time, which in equivalent 
units is (meters/s^2) * s.

Actually its g not G that you want. The value for g ~ 9.8 meters/second^2.
So you were close enough. As for units it only matters that you be consistent
with them. For MKS (meters, kilograms, seconds) g~9.8 m/s^2. For feet
g~32 ft/s^2. And in miles g~6*10^-3 miles/sec^2 = 7.8*10^4 mi/hr^2.

So the velocity at .4g after 32 hours is 1,128,960 m/s ~ 1129 km/s.
Or roughly 2,496,000 miles/hr.

Check your dimensional analysis:

v = (m/sec^2)*(sec)^2
v = m/sec^2 * sec^2
v = m

Since you want V in m/sec, not m, you\'ve got an extra sec.

The actual equation is:

v = v0 + at

v= ending velocity
v0 = starting velocity
a = acceleration
t=time

so:
v = v0 + at
v = (0) + (.4m/sec^2)(32hrs*60min/hrs*60sec/min)
v = (.4m/sec^2)(11500sec)
v=46080 m/sec


Other equations like this can be found at the SpaceFAQ, which used to be
at ftp://explorer.arc.nasa.gov/pub/SPACE/FAQ, but can be found at a

Absoulutely corrrect.

I\'m confusing the formula for Velocity (V=A*T) with the formula for
Distance Travelled (d=1/2*A*(T^2)).

Nope. The units don\'t work. It\'s:

    v(final) = v(initial) + at

assuming that acceleration is constant. To look at units:

    metres/second = metres/second + metres/(second*second) * second

The units in the \'at\' part cancel to leave just metres/second.

The formula for distance is:

    s(final) = s(initial) + 0.5at^2

Perhaps you were confusing the two.

Could a cheeper one be made just to do one function?  (i.e. create an
MFD soley for grouping turrets into batteries or one soley for
controling missiles).

The reason I ask is that quite often the cost of MFD is often the
largest portion of some ship designs (particularly fighters), and I was
looking for a way to cut down the cost.

Hmm how did you build 100 G missiles in FFS1? I don\'t remember any that
could fit in the *standard* missile displacement.

Well lets say I only need 10 percent out of each missile to hit the
defending ship. That would mean that they would be deploying a lot earlier
than the above range.

On error is logic it is not the cost of the missile versus PD system it is
the cost of the missile versus the cost of the target. So you should base
your defensive cost on how much it cost to build the targeted ship. Not how
cheaply you can build the PD lasers. If the *cheap* PD laser is not 100
percent effective under *most* conditions and circumstances, you can tell
the survivors if any about how *cost effective* the PD laser was in
comparison to the missile(s) that destroyed/damaged their ship. I am sure
they will agree with your logic.<G>

If a 250Mcr missile takes out of action/destroys a 1,500 Mcr warship, and
is reusable afterwards then the actual costs of the missiles is only for
fuel and payload, which is a lot less than 100Mcr.

Another point if the ship has to use the main laser batteries to defend
against a missile/submunitions threat, also means that those main batteries
are not firing at the enemy ships, but the enemies main batteries can be
firing at you. How long will that type of ship last in a battle, if it has
to misuse the main batteries in a such role every time a missile swarm
comes a knocking. 

By the way how vulnerable would the radiators be to a KKM attack, ie how
much damage could they take before the reducing the effectiveness of the
radiators.

Hey why not make missiles that are IR homers just for those heat radiators,
even if the they turn off the power plant the radiators will still be hot
for awhile afterwards.

We can also make a *Shrike* missiles, ones that home in active LADAR/AEMS
sensors.

Both types would be *fire and forget* type of missiles, no need for a MFD
to ride heard on them.

A supernova is when the Star runs out of fuel (ie has fused all the way to
iron in its core), the core collapses and it goes bang big time (light output
equal to a galaxy, its planetary system disappears).

A nova requires a binary system of a giant star (normally an old red giant?)
and a white dwarf (or neutron star?).
When some of the giant star is pulled on to the dwarf, it is compressed,
heated and starts a fusion reaction which causes the White Dwarf to shine
brightly
for a short period. Novas are infrequent because you need a significant
amount of 
hydrogen to be transferred in one go.

I don\'t think that you could expect a planet to be habitable in such a system.

How far out can you detonate a det-laser missile? For example, StarCruiser
(for 2300) allowed detonation at 1 hex range (up to 1,200,000 km ie 40
30kkm hexes).

Also, Starcruiser hits either scrubbed the surface fixtures and ignored
armour, or had to penetrate the armour. Against the Kafers that could be
nasty (

90% effective screen then
		20% hits to surface fixtures
		60% hits then had armour to contend with which could be 90%
effective.

Of course, it did have it\'s limits (like throwing 100d10 to resolve a 10
det-laser missile spreads\' hit locations (10 x 2 points each) ). I did like
that game.


I miss the old Traveller non-nuclear missiles - if someone could justify a
kkm I\'d appreciate it ;-)

everything in metres and seconds

v = final velocity
u = initial velocity
t = time
a = acceleration
s = distance covered whilst accelerating

s = ut + 0.5at^2
v = u + at

A = .4G which is 4m/sec^2 
T = 32 hours, or 115,200 seconds.

v = 460,800m/s
  = 1,658,880km/hr

A MRD consists of the tracking sensors, and the machinery/software tying
all the weapons in the battery together.  MRDs also make use of information
about changes in the ship\'s heading or velocity, and adjusts fire accordingly.

I don\'t see why a fighter would need a MFD, though.

Actually a closer term/name for it would be Fire Direction Center(FDC). It
is in no way the *Master* fire director for the ship. A ship would have
only one *Master* Fire Direction Center for the entire ship.

>But what does it consist of, and why is it so expensive?

Well a FDC should have some form of data computer(but not the ENIAC sized
ones listed), sensor data inputs, interior communications links, some type
of control/management console, and control links to the weapons dedicated
to the FDC. It would be a coordinator of all weapons under it control,
controlling target management and engagement there of. If it was being used
for Semi Active missiles or terminally guided missiles an illuminator would
also be needed. An Illuminator would be some type of active sensor
configured to project a tight cone or pencil beam of sensor radiations.
Other types of missiles would require some type of a communicator to send
commands to the missile(s), either tight beam or broadcast.

A *Master* Fire Direction Center would be the main center for coordination
of *all* sensor data, target management, and chief coordinator over all
FDC\'s and weapons. Ie FDC1 cover the starboard defense axis, FDC2 cover the
Forward Axis, Alert FDC1 incoming missiles your axis, etc. Kinda like the
AEGIS CIC or a EWACS plane in a battlefield. It would have to have the same
things that a FDC would have but also have to have exterior communicators,
sensor controls, and links to all FDC\'s onboard. It would have more than
one control console, at lower TL\'s especially. 

>Could a cheeper one be made just to do one function?  (i.e. create an

I would say so for only one function reduce costs, volume etc, by half.

Yes I agree, the cost a *too* high for what they can do.

For constant acceleration....

V = U + AT
V = final velocity (m/s)
U = initial velocity (m/s) = 0 m/s
A = constant acceleration (m/s^2) = 0.4 x 9.81 = 3.924 m/s^2
T = time (s) = 32 x 60 x 60 = 115,200 secs

V = 0 + (115200*3.924) = 452044.8 m/s = 452 km/s

other equations are:
V^2 = U^2 +2AS

where S = distance (m)

S = UT + (0.5 x (A x T^2))

Looks like the laws of Physics are different in the States. ;-)

In the original UK version, the equation was V = U + AT

101 Religions, an upcoming BITS/CORE publication, will give you 101 such
religions, from the normal to the completely wacky. However, this book will
be very carefully vetted prior to production to ensure that the style in
which it is written does not give offence to the more religious Traveller
players.

SCAREY POWERPLANTS

Bruce Johnson <johnson@Pharmacy.Arizona.EDU> said, about people being
nervous of having hundreds of nuclear power plants active at the starport...

Ah, like all those people (certainly in the UK) who are \'nervous\' about
living under high voltage electricity cables because of the effect of their
EM fields, or those people who claim to be affected by EM from military
microwave links that pass close to their houses. Then there would be all
those people who hardly worry at all about past \'wonderful science\' such as
the thalidomide (sp?) pill, or DES, or 3 Mile Island or trans-fatty acids or
nitrates in food or genetically modified soya or any other of the millions
of technical wonders that are claimed to be "the future" now, but might be
found to be severe problems in the future?

NB: I don\'t have views on these topics, necessarily, and I definitely don\'t
intend anyone any offence by them and PLEASE don\'t spend the next 10 TMLs
just discussing the chemical structure of DES or whatever! :-) They\'re just
the first thoughts that came into my head, ok?

One failed power plant which caused an explosion will likely cause a flood
of laws on a world. Such things may take just a few years to implement (even
with some government resistance) but may stick around for hundreds of years.
Other governments may simply object to having certain things (e.g. nuclear
power sources - as per the Australian government a few years back; is this
still the case?) in their own back yard. Add in the usual wacky human
factors and I don\'t doubt that large numbers of ports may require
powerplants to be closed down or at least put on standby while on the
ground, as well as 101 other laws about disabling starship weaponry, etc.

Other people have also 

MULTIPLE STARPORTS

Robert N Harris <rh1i+@andrew.cmu.edu> pointed out that WBH allowed several
starports with major cities, etc.

WOMEN PLAYING TRAVELLER

Vanya mentioned:
>(Course, one is my wife, and I *met* her playing Traveller)

Likewise (yes, honestly). The other two women in our RPG groups are also
wives of male players and they *are* there because they enjoy it, not
because they\'re "dragged along"! :-)

15mm FIGURES AND VEHICLES

"Michael D. Peters" <Letterworks@Comten.com> asked if anyone was still
playing with 15mm figures.

Yup, it\'s the only size I use for Traveller, as everything (from buildings
to starships to weapon ranges) is generally that much bigger than a game
such as AD&D. I have a fair collection of very old to reasonably old figures
(most of which are allegedly Traveller figures, although I have my doubts
about the quality of some of them). I\'ve also looked at Micromachines stuff
and I\'ve adapted old matchbox cars to grav vehicles (take a sports car
model, cut off the tyres, pad out the holes, apply modelling putty and shape
it to give a streamlined shape, or add in grav module \'bumps\' or whatever,
add extra features (wings, whatever), then paint. Either using a hole
already present under the car, or using a very fine drill, insert and glue
thin strong wire, or a transparent plastic pole or equivalent, then glue
this to a base, to make the vehicle \'hover\' above the ground. Matchbox
military vehicles, etc. can be adapted just as easily. I\'ve also seen some
good metal and resin vehicles, although these are often not 15mm and can be
costly.

These are definitely down to individual player/ref preference. I only play
adult groups, although many of my demo\' games have been for youngsters, so I
apply quite different principles to each. In the adult games in which I
play, taking Ars Magica as an example, I have a 16-year-old wannabe-bard in
- -55 BC or somesuch who has the "weakness for a pretty face" and "compulsive
drinker" quirks. As the oldest of our bunch of travelling youngsters (the
characters range from an 8-year old upwards) mine is the only one really
subject to strong sexual urges and also the worst at holding down his drink.
The combination tends to be extremely amusing (to us, at least). Running
away from irate fathers could get to be a habit, the irony being that
something always seems to happen to interrupt my character just before he
gets to the interesting part with the young women...

Same technobabble I use and which I proposed to IG as a possible \'canon\'

LONG RUNWAYS

anders.backman@aniware.se (Anders Backman) said, re Space Station
Architect\'s Manual / Starport Topography,

Likewise. There was an explanation (in the article I believe) which
demonstrated significant fuel savings by landing on a runway rather than
using VTOL. That was back when contra-grav didn\'t seem to be applied widely
to ships, however. As regards designing ships, the 400 ton subs. merch. has
always (to my knowledge) been depicted as having wings - not just
streamlining for hovering down in an atmosphere, but *wings* which are
clearly for forward flight in an atmosphere. So I\'ve always assumed that a
number of Traveller starships use runways in preference to VTOL landing pads.

Would anyone care to comment on the relative safety of either approach?
\'Canon\' starport designs in MT and TNE supplements tend only to have landing
pads, and often these are in relatively close proximity (given the potential
harm an starship might cause if it crash-landed) with insufficient berms or
equivalent shielding.

Yeah, at at TL15 Imperial, it\'d be a (very) Light Cruiser. What\'s
the average radius of a cross section of the Yamato? 15m? 20m? At
20m (average) the Yamato would be Pi*20^2*283/14 dtons, or ~25

So I\'d hope it\'d be that small. I\'ll post data when I actually have

in consistant scale? I might just make some. I can do metal, but I
actually prefer resin (my resin casts don\'t have bubbles, I hate

I was just thinking that (IIRC) "fiori" is Italian for "flower", and

connection or identity between the "Fiorin" and the "Floriani".

Hurrah!

I like that -- anything more detailed is essentially a "house rule".  This
is also consistent with the overall approach in T4 of limiting the details
of the "canonical" universe, so that new referees are not intimidated into
not developing campaigns in the Imperium for fear of either losing
"canonicality" or doing a crippling amount of research beforehand. Another
good example of this is the three sectors that are omitted from M:0 (past
and future, not just FS).  It\'s nice to have the privelege of making my
own campaign space without having to worry about it being "invalidated"
later by another supplement.

Thanks, Marc.

 Not to be an IG apologist, but let\'s keep in mind the difference between
hopeful optomism (ie the product may still go out the door next week) and
intentional falsehood (the product is in the mail).

As long as my players are satisfied with the games I can produce, I will
continue to work with IG (albeit, not through direct sales).

Just watch out; those things are *bugger-all* expensive, thanks to the 
fact that they have etched metal parts for all the little wings and 
fiddly bits; very cool, but very expensive to produce (the Yamato is 
something like $10us at my FLGS... too rich for my blood, and I used to 
*love* Space Cruiser Yamato).

If the prices were reasonable, and the detail good, I would be interested 
(especially if they were, say, twice the current scale... more space for 
all the cool fiddly bits, and more room for the scale to allow for 
different sizes for fighters and such).

The boxed module Beltstrike actually provided some (optional) rules for
reaction mass consumption on CT starships.  I believe they were worked out
so that a ship could accelerate continuously for 4 weeks without running
out of fuel.  I can look them up for you if you\'re interested.

It\'s hard to justify this at lower tech levels, but at higher tech levels
there is one possibility that I don\'t see much discussion of here.  At
higher tech levels, the maneuver drive could be related to repulsor
technology (described in the next paragraph).  If its reaction mass was
accelerated to near-c velocity, a ship could conceivably have enough for
four weeks of continuous burn.

It\'s hard to imagine a device that can accelerate a significant mass (a
mass that you could actually notice if you held it in your hand -- which
is what the fuel rates indicate) to a near-c velocity over a distance of
just a few meters.  However, over many thousands of meters it might be
possible.  If the maneuver drive projected some kind of gravimetric tunnel
out behind the ship, which acted to continuously accelerate the reaction
mass over many kilometers of distance, the final emission velocity might
approach that of light.  Presto!  A reaction drive so fuel-efficient it
makes HEPlaR look like a gas guzzler. 

The only additional detail I might attempt is to figure out the actual
emission velocity required, given a consumption rate.  Those equations are
pretty heavy, though, so I\'d rather just use the Andy Slack approach and
block it out using 3rd person technobabble and a liberal dose of ellipses. 

And like Hal said for his suggestion, it\'s just an idea, not a new
proposal for canon.  It also fails to cover the lower tech levels.  Still,
I\'ve been attached to it for some time.

I assume you mean MFD :-)

If that is all it consists of why does the cost go up so sharply with
increase in effective range (10 fold between 30kkm and 300kkm)?
Also if it consists of tracking sensors, how do they compare to LIDAR or
AEMS?

>I don\'t see why a fighter would need a MFD, though.

Two reasons under the current rules

+4dm at TL12
and
to improve weapon damage (groups of small weapons are more effective
under the current rules than one large weapon - for illustration in
THUDDD 7 one of the fighter designs has four laser turrets as one
battery).

The existing design rules don\'t give too much details on what they are
(or have I missed something?).

    A couple of points:

    As far as I remember, Imperial Rules of War (ROW) prohibit nukes _on
planetary surfaces_. Nukes have been a staple on warships since CT.

    A missile sans warhead, dropped from orbit, will do nuke-equivalents
in damage anyways (remember ke = mv^2/2), so limiting nukes on ships will
make no difference that way.

Very little of which is affected by range (300kkm FDC is 10 times the

OK, I can understand how range affects these components (though not a 10

I know someone with family in the affected area of NYS.  When
someone mentioned the lack of looting in the area to him, he said
"I have no difficulty believing this at all - the would-be
looters are probably too busy trying to stay alive and warm to be
out looting."

As far as understatement goes, I don\'t think the English language
contains vocabulary sufficient to describe just how much being in
that part of the world sucks - and my French is worse than
non-existent, so I can\'t say whether it has the vocabulary,
either.  When the weather is nice, and everything works, it\'s a
lovely area - but right now, I\'m glad I\'m in the Metropolitan
Rotten Apple.

Pretty much the same.  Niagara-Mohawk is busy trying to restore
power, and Consolidated Edison of New York is helping, as is the
Power Authority of the State of New York - but there\'s just so
much downed and broken wire that it\'s become almost a pure
manpower job.  I don\'t think NY has actually had high-tension
towers crumple like I saw in TV reports from Qubec (is that the
correct direction for the accent?), but the situation still
cannot be called pretty, and repair/recovery is slow at best.
There\'s grumbling around here about why hasn\'t Pataki called out
the Guard to organize an evacuation of the affected area - I
don\'t think the people who are grumbling realize (a) how big of a
problem that would be, or (b) how long it would take the Guard to
get such an effort together.

They\'re probably not geeps - or at least not GP40s - I think
those are not diesel-electric, and if the major problem was

By knowing the units involved, you can practically derive this:

distance is in meters (m).

time is in seconds (s).

velocity is in meters per second (m/s).

acceleration is in meters per second per second, or meters per
second-squared (m/s^2)

So, convert all values into the appropriate unit:

1G (acceleration) = 10 m/s^2, so 0.4g = 4 m/s^2

32 hours = (32 * 60 * 60) s

velocity is in units that suggest that it can be computed by
multiplying acceleration by time (v = at).

So, multiply the two numbers:

4 * 32 * 60 * 60 = 128 * 60 * 60 = 128 * 3600 = 64 * 7200
64 * 7200 = 32 * 14400 = 16 * 28800 = 8 * 57600 
8 * 57600 = 4 * 115200 = 2 * 230400 = 460800

The final speed is 460,800 m/s.

(for reference: the speed of light is roughly 300,000,000 m/s.)

But still much cheaper than a whole missile (amortized per missile
killed, the cost will be microscopic, even for a big laser).

I had usedthis concept for bay missiles. A 50 ton missile bay
carried a romotely controlled craft that was just and drives and
missiles (and a sensor).

A full on hit with a KKM will kill a battleship----which is why they
carry all those lasers :-) Submunitions turn out to be less nasty
than originally thought as I recall from the beta list (er,

Funny, I thought they were a great deal. I guess I know too much

the big buggers are like $10.

See I always want to have BBs not be too big. At my scale a
Scout/Courier was, well, small. About 3/8 of an inch long as I
recall. On the other hand it really gives a sense of scale next
to a big ship!

I have tried this assumption, but too many of my players asked why our
current tech level was so special that I started trying to decide whether
it was.  I finally decided that it really was not.

My current feeling is that either a TL represents a measurable economic
reality, like doubled production, or it represents the average time a lot
of planets took.  As a hack, I am assuming both for my own personal PE rules.

As far as your suggestion of basing all games at TL12, I must say I
approve.  I have been thinking that some tech levels were far less
interesting than others, yet I cannot remember a substantial tech change
that did not feel major to the people of the time.  (I am not a believer in
holes in the tech table.  For that matter, linear projections bother me a
bit :)  )

Well, at least in the case of thalidomide, this is a classic case of why
you must test systems _as_ delivered, not as prototyped. 

Thalidomide has two optical isomers, one has a marked tranquilizing
effect, the other also has a marked teratogenic effect. The research lab
synthetic pathway produced almost entirely the \'good\' version, but was far
too inefficient to produce anything other than the amounts needed for
clinical trials. 

The far more efficient commercial synthesis produced about 50:50...it
still worked as well for its intended purpose, and in fact, since
isolation of optically pure isomers at that point in time still consisted
of sorting pure crystals under a microscope (!) it was not known at the
time why the stuff \'suddenly\' turned teratogenic.

It wasn\'t until the late 80\'s, early 90\'s when chromatographic materials
that could separate optical isomers became available that the mystery was
competely solved. Of course, thalidomide, which is a very effective
therapeutic agent for a variety of conditions, such as leprosy and certain
symptoms of AIDS is such \'EVIL\' stuff that no one will use it. The fact
that the only places it is being used, like Brazil, lack any reasonable
controls to make sure pregnant women (the ONLY group who shouldn\'t take
it) don\'t get it, and the resultant thalidomide babies scare everyone so
it doesn\'t get used.

A similar thing happened some years back with L-Tryptophan. It became a
very popular dietary supplement because of a number of alleged
therapeutical benefits (mostly as a sleeping aid...high concentrations of
the stuff in turkey is the proposed reason for the post Thanksgiving
dinner coma experienced by so many here in the US), but soon it became
apparent that it might be severely toxic, since some people were getting
sick and dying from taking it.

The FDA immediately banned it. Later research discovered that a new
manufacturing process by one company resulted in a product that had a
trace of some very toxic substance in it. They modified their process to
eliminate the toxic stuff, and the resulting stuff was fine. Of course the
FDA still banned it.

Hell we\'ve proven that cyclamates are  less toxic than any of the
substitutes (saccharin, Equal) we have now, and the studies showing that
it caused cancer in rats were a direct consequence of the huge dosages,
but it\'s still banned here in the US.

But hey! it was bad once so we should never use it again! Of course, the
same can be said for fire (in fact, fire is one of the most dangerous
things mankind has ever discovered) and somehow we still manage to
continue using that.

Not that I can think of. I think it basicly has you being a novice when
you join and until they are sure that you are ready to take the vows of
the order. Once you take the vows, you are a brother or sister. Each
"chapter" has a Abbot/Abbes (or sometimes for nuns "Mother Superior" in
charge. A chapter is basicly a single "community" (ie a single convent
or monastery). There are some other rankings *above* that that I\'m not
real sure about culminating with someone at the Vatican who is
responsible for the entire order.

BTW, many *priests* are organized similarly. For example, the
Fransciscans, the Dominicans, and the Jesuits. The Jesuits make an
interesting example, as their founder was a former soldier and
organized them in a somewhat military manner. The head Jesuit is the
Father General.

Oh yeah, for all I know, *all* Catholic priests are organized into
orders, but I can\'t swear to it.

How about arangement or heirarchy or structure or TO (altho\' I\'m not sure

You just about can\'t have an increase in one area of technology without
improvements in others.  Do you know what a dewar flask is (Thermos is
famous for manufacturing them.)?  Do they have anything to do with medical
technology?  How about refrigerators?  How about pressure suits?  How
about...

I could go on, but the three items I did mention are direct results of
medical research.

Interesting phrase "a capella" (both spellings are correct).  Like most
musical terms, it is from Italian and the original meaning was in the manner
of the chapel.  That\'s right like church music, no instruments.  I\'m tempted
to ask who changed it and point out that it wasn\'t God, but this is not the
right place to open that can of worms.

Let\'s see that\'s: E = M C^2 where E is the...

No, that\'s a little more advanced than you were looking for isn\'t it.  :-)

If you have T4 book 1 look up chapter 9 (SPACE TRAVEL) starting on p 115.

If you are going to accelerate half way there and decelerate the rest of the
way in,
T = SQR(D/A)
D = A/4 x T^2
A = 4D/T^2
Where T is the time travelled, D is the distance travelled and A is the
acceleration.

The above quoted formula are different from the high school physics texts.
The question you asked actually requires the HSPT formula.  The one in
question is D = AT (it\'s always the easy ones that get me too).  So...

..4g in Traveller is 4 m/s/s and 32 hours = 32 hours x 60 minutes/hour x 60
seconds/minute = 115,200 seconds.  Multiply those together and you get 4
m/s/s x 115,200 s = 460,800 m/s.  Wow, you are really cooking.  460,800 m/s
x 3,600 s/h / 1000 m/km = 1,628,880 km/h.

For a second there I thought that you might need the earlier formula, but
then I remembered the speed of light is c. 1,080,000,000 km/h.  Still, 5.429
light seconds per hour is not bad for a day and a third\'s work.  You would
be covering an astronomical unit in just over 92 hours.

Weapons grade lasers turn a "mirror finish" to junk. While we can get
99.9% (I think) reflectivity on things like telescope mirrors, you
can\'t put that on a missile, partly because of expense, and partly
because it won\'t *stay* that reflective in the sort of environment a
missile is stored and launched in. 

So if you have a 99% reflective (damn good!) mirror coating, that means
that 1% of the pulse is still absorbed. Which is enough to turn the
coating into high temp plasma. And in the process, ruin the coating for
some distance around the point the laser pulse hit. 

Ask the folks who work with mere kilojoule pulse lasers what happens to
their mirrors if a dust speck gets on them. :-)

With Traveller\'s megajoul to gigajoule pulses, mirroring isn\'t worth
the cost it adds.

	Well, the printers may be hooked back into the grid by now.  Then
again, Montreal kind of had a severe power shortage this afternoon; the
East End lost power, the subway system didn\'t have enough amperage
available to run trins, and street and stop lights were turned off to save
juice.  Rush hour was likely a nightmare; I took a train home rather than
face the buses.

	So, maybe :\\.  I couldn\'t tell.  The local media are paying a lot
more attention to the local situation rather than what\'s happening
stateside.

The problem is that you are generating the "well" *from* the ship.
Therefore, it is *attached* to it, and what you are tring is no
different than the old idea of throwing a big magnet ahead of your ship
to pull it along.

Again, unless the generator is *independent* of the vessel, it\'ll work
just like the magnet idea above.

One suggested design was the "nuclear shotgun". You take a nuke
designed to maximize the x-ray output and use various known tricks
(like grazing incidence mirrors) to redirect the radiation into a
forward pointing cone. Then, in front of that you put something
material that is good at absorbing the xrays, but also converts easily
to a plasma. In front of that\' you put your "shot".

Thus, the bomb goes off, the xrays move out at lightspeed, bounce
around a bit and hit the "coupler" material (I\'m told styrofoam works
well!) well before the physical pieces of the bomb. The coupler flashes
into vapor and imparts most of the bomb\'s energy to the shot. 

The idea was posted on rec.arts.sf.science. And it was thought to be
able to give fractional c velocities to the "shot". 

If you don\'t want the players to have nukes, you could get the same
effect (I think) if you could accurately focus an X-ray laser pulse on
the back of a properly designed warhead. 

So you launch a bunch of missiles, and when they get close enough, they
seperate the warheads, and they do *something* to make their backside
extra visible to you. Meanwhile, they are keeping their front ends
aimed at the target. Zap the missile and it fires the near-c
projectiles at the target. 

This *might* work better than just using the laser against the target
given a situation where the missiles (at "close" range" can get a
better lock than the ship (at long range). After all, they can easily
*make* themselves easy to target for the firing vessel and still be
hard to target for the target vessel.

It also let\'s you get a bunch of warheads spaced "around" the target
and then zap them all in quick sequence. That could give point defense
several *thousand* targets to deal with.

Ok coming right back at you, But is not what CSC, MT, CT say. So there 3 to
2 infavor of a non MFD. <G> 

Ok now that is out of my system. 

It is in SSDS due to it was *kludged* from FFS1 in the mad scramble to put
out some ship building rules for T4.

It is in FFS2 because it was in FFS1, there was not enough time to
*complete* job on FFS2.

Range should not have any effect, but the original request was for what is
in a *MFD*. A weapons range should be determined by its ability to deliver
the *package* to the desired target and the ability of the sensors to
detect a target at that range.

	There\'s been relatively little trouble of that sort here too;
generator thefts are skyrocketing, and domestic violence is up, but the
overall crime rate is down 60% or so.  I think it\'s due partly to the cold
but also to the fact that everyone remembers what happened the last time
the Canadian Forces took civilians prisoner :/.

	Well, actually, it could be worse.  I don\'t think it\'s a disaster
so much as it is an inconvenience of insanely huge proportions.  Aside from
trees, the hydro grid, and loss of livestock, property damage has been
pretty darn minimal.  It\'s not like there was an earthquake or anything;
people got frozen out, went to public shelters or moved in with friends or
family, waited until the power came on, and went home.  Still, I agree;
it\'s real nice having power and not having to worry about running out of
firewood.

	It\'s the same here.  Hydro has the Forces doing the gruntwork of
demolishing towers, cutting branches, removing damaged equipment, recycling
cable, and so forth, while the Hydro crew concentrate on the actual
reconstruction work.

	If it was rising from left to right, yes, although the correct
spelling in English doesn\'t require the accent.  As far as the towers go,
yup... a couple of hundred of the things went.  In some areas they pulled
each other down one after the other like dominoes.  Pretty scary.

Which is another possible venue for a ship so old that it has to coast
rather than thrust all the way to the 100 diameter limit. "Experience
free-fall, just like the ancient astronauts." I expect that you *could*
sell cruises on such a ship, even if it was a modern design *based* on
the old ships.

> I agree with Leonard, there will always be a scattering of truly ancient

And if you are starting a game, and nobody got a Ship benefit, but they
have a modest amount of money and lots of engineering skills (plus some
legal ones) you might just have them hear about the "orbital junkyard"
where lots of older ships are stashed until someone feels like
salvaging or scrapping them.  And they can decide to tinker one back
into working order. :-)

I\'m not sure that a solar sail type ship would be compatible with jump
drive. But if it was, that\'d be a *really* interesting ship. And even
if it wasn\'t, they\'d be *very* competetive in a system with several
worlds with decent sized populations. 

Old chemical rockets are apt to be a *very* niche market. Though I bet
that oxy-hydrogen rockets would be popular in the outer planets and
outer belts, because it\'s *so* easy to convert ice into fuel. 

Fission power plants may be popular in such places as well. If you are
processing nickel iron asteriods on any sort of large scale, you\'ll
have *tons" of "trace" components like gold and uranium. Heck, if they
build fission plants in the belt, I\'d not be surprised to see gold
being used as shielding!

There are several "low tech" approaches to fission powerplants that\'d
be workable for belters. Just use *lots* of rock for shielding. Given
the low gravity, "China syndrome" is *not* a worry. In fact, if you
place the reactor at the center of the asteroid, there\'s no place for
it to go. And you\'d probably want to use designs that have a low
reaction rate *unless* the moderator is being circulated. (ie if the
coolant gets too hot, it slows down the reaction).

A lot of people seem to have problem getting KNO3 to make home-made black
powder.   Well, if you are really desperate, it\'s not that hard to make...
This recipie is from Birringucchio, Pyrotechnia, 1540.  It was used
"commercially" as recently as the US Civil War when the Union blockade of
the South prevented shipments of Chilean Saltpeter from getting into port.
  I\'ve done this for a historical recreation event... it\'s "fun", but a bit
messy and some people find it to be a tad distasteful.

Find old horse manure, the kind that has sat under shelter, and has little
white threads on the surface.   If you can\'t find horsemanure, just take
your own manure and let it ferment under cover for a few months.   Also,
take urine and let it set out until it is good and fermented.  Get some
hardwood ashes and lime.

Get a 50 gallon drum or barrel, and punch a hole in the bottom.  Put a cork
in the hole. Now line the bottom with cloth.  Then add 2" of manure, 1.5"
of ashes, and 1" of lime.  Repeat until you are near the top.  Now pour in
the fermented urine.  Let it all stand for a few days.  At this point it
has a particular amusing odor.  Then drain off and collect the liquid from
the bottom hole.   Pour in some more fermented urine, and repeat.  Now wash
it with clean water until the water coming out isn\'t brown or yellow
anymore and doesn\'t taste bitter to the tounge.

Boil the collected liquids down until they just start to throw crystals
while hot, and then add a enough hot water to double the volume and let
cool.  You might want to stand UPWIND while boiling this down.   You will
get almost 10 pounds of crystals of KNO3, with a bit of NaNO3 and NaCl
admixed, various brown and yellow contaminants, and some detritus too.
Recrystalize once or twice from clean water to get fairly pure pale yellow
KNO3.

From 100 pounds of horse or people manure and 75 gallons of fermented urine
you can get from 2 to 5 pounds of KNO3, depending on a number of factors.

You might want to do some of this outdoors.

Yes.  Not because I was desperate to get KNO3 (I was a chem graduate
student at the time), but because I wanted to recreate some of the more
authentic sights, sounds, and smells of the 16\'th C for Northern California
Rennaisence Faire.

Renn Faires (and festiavals, and the SCA) are all way TOO clean and
sanitized... no dead animals in streets, no pisspots emptied out of second
story windows, the meat isn\'t nearly rotten enough, etc..

It was amusing to watch the modern 20\'th C person\'s reaction as I told them
what I was doing...   when it finally completely dawned on them that I was
stirring a bucket of SHIT, they often went a delicate green.   I could then
play with their reactions, and discuss the other unsundry realities of life
in the 16\'th C with them.  Or, they would leave.

Actually, it\'s all true.  Birringuchio\'s book, Pyrotechnia, is available
in reprint from Dover books, and is a good book to buy for historical
pespectives...  Actually, I left out the most interesting part...  in
Birringuchio, the recipie says to leach until it no longer tastes bitter

    'body' => 'The PCs in my game are going to spend some time swashbuckling.
Therefore, they need some guidelines for ship operations.  So
without further ado, here is the

Swashbuckler\'s Guide

I. Ship designs

1. Longboats
   Lengths = 3-5 (no sail), 10-50 meters
   Crew    = 2 Rower/Marines per meter; 4 Sailors.
   Speed   = 20/45m per round; 30/140km per day
   Hull    = 10 points per meter length
   Load    = 50 kg per meter length

   This is a coastal raiding vessel only, not made for commerce.  It
   handles the open sea well, and its shallow draft allows shore landings.
   It cannot support cannon, ballista, or ram.

   Since practically everyone on board remains seated in their
   rowing position and cannot move around, long trips produce very
   sore raiders.

   The 3-meter to 5-meter versions are for all practical purposes canoes
   or lifeboats.

2. Galleys
   Lengths = 50-150 meters
   Crew    = 10 Rowers + 10 Rowers per 10m;
             5 Sailors + 1 Sailor per 10m; 
             5 Marines + 3 Marines per 10m
   Speeds  = 30/140m per round; 25/45km per day  (50m-90m)
             30/100m per round; 25/35km per day  (100m-150m)
   Hull    = 300 points + 2 points per meter length
   Load    = 10 kg per meter length

   These beasties are coastal trading ships or warships.  Though 
   strong enough to handle the high seas, they are susceptible to
   destruction in severe weather.

   A galley can be designed to be a war galley.  War galleys have
   the following stats:

      Crew  = 20 Rowers per 10m;  2 Sailors per 10m; 5 Marines per 10m
      Speed = 25/100m per round; 20/35km per day (50m-90m)
              20/90m per round;  15/30km per day (100m-150m)
      Hull  = 450 points + 2 points per meter length
      Load  = 15 kg per meter length

   Per each 100 hull points, the galley may carry one cannon or
   two ballista.  The ship may be equipped with a ram.

3. Sailing Ships
   Lengths  = 10-100 meters
   Crew     = 2 Sailors per 10m; 5 Marines per 10m
   Speeds   = 100m per round; 35km per day (10m-30m, 70m-100m)
              140m per round; 45km per day (40m-60m)
   Hull     = 10 points per meter length
   Load     = 100 kg per meter length

   Built for the high seas, the sailing ship can withstand violent
   storms and long voyages with ease.  

   Per each 100 hull points, the sailing ship may carry one cannon
   or two ballista.  The ship may be equipped with a ram.


II. Ship combat

1. Sighting

Maximum visibility for land is about 40 kilometers; for another ship,
300 meters.

Evasion is maneuvering the ship out of sight of another ship for the day.
The difference in speed between the two vessels dictates the ease
in evasion:

Difference in speed		Evasion
- ----             ----
0-10m/round slower		Average
11-20m/round slower		Difficult
21-30m/round slower		Formidable
31-40m/round slower		Staggering
41m+ slower			Impossible
faster				Easy

2. Combat

A weapons hit is a function of distance, given by the Traveller
range bands (0 to 300m).

Weapon	Crew	Reload  Damage:
        to      time    Shot	Pitch	Crew	Weapon
        Operate
- ----
Cannon	 4	4	2d6x7	4d6	2d6-5	Snake Eyes
Ballista 4	2	2d6x3	2d6	2d6-10	n/a
Ram	 		one to two thirds the hull points of attacker

Notes:
* Fewer crew may operate the weapons, at a corresponding time penalty.
* Pitch burns the ship decks, and spreads by d6 each turn; i.e. in its
  second turn pitch from a cannon will do 5d6 burning damage to the
  ship.  4 men can put out d6 of burning pitch in one turn.
* Grappling is a Difficult task; but if both ships want to grapple
  then it is automatic.  After grappling, the two groups conduct
  melee combat as usual.
* Repairs up to half of the damage received may be made: 1 hull point
  per crew assigned per turn.
* Ships receiving damage equal to half their hull points move at half
  speed; damage equal to 3/4 their hull points reduces movement
  by half again, and so on.


Well, that\'s what I\'ve got so far.  Any suggestions?

So to destroy the missle you have to to get a hit on the same
spot twice.  And if it is designed to slough off that 1%
ablitively into space, then it the spot won\'t be any bigger
than the laster beam.  It might be enough to get a missle through.

Though it really doen\'t strain realitiy to thing that at

The way to permanently remove the radiation is to *speed up* decay. And
doing that on *fissionables*, rather than "fallout" or "waste" while
result in a *huge* explosion (several times the normal yeild).

There\'s no other way that dampers, given their description *can*
permanently neutralize radioactivity.

So when using them to clean up after a nuke strike, figure that there
will be a large "flash" of radiation as all the decay happens at once.

Not that easy. The problem is that as far as I know, it\'s prett much
the only "yellow yellow". The others are some weird shades that people
aren\'t all that likely to like.

Breeder reactors are a special design. They are actually only worth the
trouble if you want to build a stockpile of weapons, or if you don\'t
have fusion, and are running low on fissionables. 

Their advantage is that you can *chemically* seperate the Pu. But you
still have to deal with the *highly* radioactive used fuel rods. 

Most reactor designs that you\'d design for the purpose of produciung
power are *lousy* at making Pu. It\'s just that most US and Soviet
reactor designs are based on reactors designed for the express
*purpose* of producing Pu. Other designs, such as the Canadian CANDU
reactors are much safer and don\'t produce Pu.

It just has to start into a landing trajectory from "near" orbit, then
switch on the drive and do a suicide run. Odds of destroying it in time
are slim. And it\'d do quite well as a city buster. Remember, Meteor
Crater in Arizona was created by a *house sized* rock not moving more
than 10 km/sec or so. Which isn\'t that far from orbital velocity. At
that speed, from a 200 km orbit, it\'s *20 seconds* to impact. 

If the ship chooses to boost all the way to the ground, it *shortens*
that time.

Also, we are now fairly sure that novas *require* a close binary
system, with one of the stars being a white dwarf (though a neutron
star might work too). 

They have to be close enough for material given off by the "normal"
star to get sucked in by the white dwarf. In *massive* quantities. When
enough material accumulates the pressure on the lower layers causes a
fusion reaction. In short the accumulated hydrogen and whatnot
detonates in a fusion blast that covers the entire surface of the
dwarf. 

This cycle can repeat at regular intervals for a long time. 

If too much material accumulates too fast, the blast will cause a
Supernova. That destroys the dwarf. The other type of Supernova is when
a massive star fuses clear down until it produces iron.

A note on the "cannibalism" bit. Don\'t forget that *technically* that
describes many Christian sects. Remember what Communion is supposed to be.

But for more shock value, a quite civilized society could have
cannibalism without too much trouble. Say as part of the funeral rites.

Good point.  But I\'ve always assumed this to be the case.  I\'ve always viewed
Traveller character ranks as encompassing a range of actual authority.  In my
mind, I consider these differences as those deriving from adminstration and not
necessarily the title.  A Fleet Admiral in charge of a Tanker Fleet doesn\'t
quite cut the same mustard as a Fleet Admiral or even a Commodore in an Battle
Fleet, etc.

WRT religion, I hope you read Pat Connaughton\'s post about the Catholic Church
ranks and titles.  It shows the kind of flexibility that exists in that global
organization.

Good ideas, all.  As you point out, variation in population requires different
treatement, etc.  I\'m most concerned with the \'normal\' setup of and what it
should be.  The results are posted as "Table of Ranks - Long (Was - Re:
Religious Careers)."  When it becomes necessary, I think I\'ll take your
suggestions of Primates and Primas, as well as Pat Connaughton\'s mention of
Legates, Chanellors, Chamberlains, etc.

Sure was!  Thanks.  I found some info at    http://www.vatican.va/
but it isn\'t organized to find what I was really looking for, which is what
you\'ve provided.

For those interested in creating a military religious order, this info is
excellent but also of interest is

http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/

All kinds of information about the Military Orders, especially those still
existing.0

The whole hierarchy is confusing as I\'m finding, especialy when you look at the
military orders which have a nobility component.  Additionally, some titles are
apparently administrative, and not necessarily hierarchical, especially in the
military orders.  I\'ve decided to simplify the different ideas I\'ve had by
separating them into a Church, Monastic Orders, and Military Orders (both Noble
and Common) and streamlining or stretching where appropriate.  They are all
clergy to one extent or another.


The Church

Ordainment replaces the idea of a commission.  Going to a 4 year Seminar allows
a character to enter the clergy with rank of Reverend.

(*note*  Pilgrim, Missionary, Deacon, Chaplain and Inquisitor were put into
heirarchy by me to give flavor and fill out the table of ranks for Traveller.
Deacon apparently covers a range but I thought it should be reflected somewhere
in the sub-pastor ranks titles, as did Reverend, which I wanted to represent
entry-level priests.  Pilgrim and Missionary give the idea of a young person and
is relatively distant from the main work of the church.  Exorcist sounds like a
great title for a sergeant/type NCO rank, as do Chaplain and Inquisitor.
"Inquisitor" just sounds scary thanks to Torquemada and Poe.  And having it
equate to a world-weary hardened Sergeant Major rank helps.  The title of Grand
Inquisitor was left out of all the ranks and should be appointed for the whole
church or each Monastic or Religious Order (I seem to recall that Torquemada was
only Grand Inquisitor for the Fransican Order - or whichever order he belonged
to).  There is a Cardinal and Cardinal-Protector to reflect range of power
within Cardinals.  Perhaps Monsignor should replace the former.)

D1  Pilgrim
D2  Missionary
D3  Acolyte
D4  Deacon
D5  Exorcist
D6  Reader
D7  Porter
D8  Chaplain
D9  Inquisitor

P1   Reverend
P2   Pastor
P3   Vicar
P4   Bishop
P5   Archbishop
P6   Cardinal
P7   Cardinal-Protector
P8   Patriach
P9   Ponitff

I\'m going to not use the Metropolitan, Primate, Legate, etc. stuff because that
seems to be of most significance internally, especially the colleges, etc.  But
I am thankful to Pat for the info.  I will use it for internal administration
though.


Monastic Orders

No \'enlisted\' ranks. Gender specific and alternate names provided.  Although the
sophont stuff is tongue in cheek.

M1  Novice
M2  Lay Brother / Lay Sister / Lay Sophont
M3  Monk / Nun
M4  Friar
M5  Father / Mother / Parent Sophont
M6  Father / Mother Superior / Parent Sophont Superior
M7  Prior / Prioress
M8  Abbott / Abbess / Archimandrite / Grand Prior / Grand Prioress
M9  Arch-Abbott / Arch-Abbess


Military Order

Promotion for enlisted ranks same as for other services, i.e., 1/year for the
first term.  There isn\'t a long hierarchy so promotion rolls should be tough,
and of course, 07 grand Master should be unavailable to PCs, I should think.
Additionally, unless the character went to seminary, he should be required to
spend at least one term as an enlisted man before being \'commissioned.\'
(Seminary would be similar to naval or military academy for religious
careers).   The enlisted ranks are not as extensive as the other types of
organization, but I\'ve tried to use the \'enlisted\' Church ranks as much as
possible.  Soldier replaces Acolyte.  Sergeant replaces Exorcist, Reader and
Porter, which don\'t seem to have as much usefulness in military context.

E1  Pilgrim
E2  Missionary
E3  Soldier
E4  Deacon
E5  Sergeant
E6  Chaplain
E7  Inquisitor

O1  Lieutenant
O2  Sub-Commander
O3  Commander
O4  Marshall
O5  Master / Prior
O6  Grand Prior
O7  Grand Master


Noble Ranks (This is bastardized from various descriptions of various religious
military orders - for more info see  http://www.chivalricorders.ord/vatican/
).  The main confusion I had was in thinking that Monsignor was a rank, its not
apparently.  It is more of a title in recognition of service, as Pat described.
Thus, Cardinal can also be a Monsignor.  The Noble ranks within the church I\'ve
described here are probably going to be expressly anit-canon as soon as Noble
supplement comes out (perhaps I\'ll rework it then).  But, you can use them in a
couple of different ways:

(1) They are separate titles of nobility and mutually exclusive whatever other
feudal ranks exist within a society.  A holder of these ranks swears fealty to
the church above all, and disavows the same to secular governments.

(2) They are separate from, but not contradictory to other organizations.  This
would represent a clear separation between church and state, a title in one,
forbears a title in the other (and the church is subservient to the state, in
temporal matters at least).

(3)  They are complementary.  This would involve some combination of church and
state, to varying degrees, whether rule by divine right or constitutional
monarchy I think (though I\'m sure my brethren and sistren across the pond would
better be able to explain the interrelations between the two in at least one
\'Great\' example ;-).  Thus. you might have title such as Cleon I, Emperor of the
Third Imperium, Archduke of Sylea, Primate of the Holy Church of the Black Sun,
Bearer of the Royal Codpiece, Holder of the Vinyl Reliquary of St. Elvis the
Legshaker of Tupelo, T.C.B.I.A.F. ("Takin\' Care of Business In A Flash"). etc.,
etc.

In the last 2 systems, the religious noble titles would not be automatically
determined by Soc., but they must be earned, generally, i.e., no player
character would start out as a Count and a Bailiff.

Soc:   Title
A       Monsignor
B       Knight / Chevelier
C       Donat
D       Bailiff
E       Chamberlain
F       Legate
G       Primate

Noble Religious Military Orders:  There are lots of these in real life and many
of them required proofs of noble descent to qualify for membership.  That is why
I\'ve lowered the name title for religious nobility to Monsignor.  Some noble
military orders would be open to only Knights and above, but since this may keep
the order too small to be useful, some may allow monsignors to participate.
Again feudal rank won\'t necessarily equate to religious rank.  The ranks for
such orders would consist of only the officer / commissioned parallels of the
\'common\' military orders   This results in no enlisted ranks for such orders,
weakening their effectiveness as military units somewhat.  Ways to handle this:
since they\'re nobles already they furnish their own enlisted ranks which are
personally loyal to individuals; they have enlisted ranks made of \'commoners,\'
who may never aspire to their ranks, but are able to serve; or, they operate
without enlisted ranks as more elite and independent servants of their religion,
which might include commando and undercover operations, as well as recruiting
and other more public activities more in keeping with nobles.  Finally, such
organizations may simply operate within and/or in association with other orders
and/or their secular goverment.  This would vary from order to order.

Whew.  That is a lot of stuff.  Perhaps the sheer volume of my spiel will
convince Marc or whoever makes such decisions that they should hire me to write
whatever for them and save me from the legal career that is my most likely
future.

Serves you right when the GM says you were critically wounded but somehow

Right after sending this message, I realized that I made a mistake, the

Sorry about that.

The worst part is, you can\'t use either of these engines in a standard
missile.  The T-plate is too big, and the HEPlaR requires a fusion plant (10
m^3 minimum).  Oh well.

Which is another possible venue for a ship so old that it has to coast
rather than thrust all the way to the 100 diameter limit. "Experience
free-fall, just like the ancient astronauts." I expect that you *could*
sell cruises on such a ship, even if it was a modern design *based* on
the old ships.

Yes but after a bit of up powering PD weapons to pen the armored missile,
they become more of a major weapons system in power and cost.

>Is this [PD laser] using the optional *grav* focussed array?
The TL-12 version was grav focussed (which is not optional in canonical
Traveller...). You can design a very nice TL-13 X-ray non-grav-focus
if you like.

>It still can but the chance of hitting is reduced, unless the *range rate*
>is fast enough.
I\'m not sure what you mean by "range rate"; I think a lot of your
views are still coloured by your naval experience. If the missile is
going to hit the ship, it\'s coming (nearly) straight at it (possibly
jinking a little), which is the easiest possible situation for a 
lightspeed weapon. Lasers travel in straight lines...
I could design a system at TL-8 that could hit
a target under those conditions. Acquiring the target and handing it
off to a PD system requires good coordination between sensors and
weapons, but that\'s not impossible with good computers. Especially
if you\'re willing to assume that any 30-G/700 km/s targets closing on
your ship are hostile :-) 

>I get 3,599 km/s final *velocity* *speed* *range rate*.
(That\'s one hour at 100 G\'s, right?)
For your 10-G and 30-G missiles the impact velocities are 360 km/s
and ~1000 km/s, each. (And one needs to launch the 30-G one 
about 100 million km out to give it that much of a run-up, too - 
though that does help to make it harder to detect.)

>If it quits accel
>and then travels for another minute the distance it would travel is
>215,940km, well outside the minimum detection range.
Let\'s see what the detection range actually is, shall we? In the
absence of a posted design I\'ll assume the minimum possible 
thruster plate - which requires 10 MW. That\'s a signature (FFS2/DSR) of
- -0.5. Advanced (TL-12) masking reduces it to -1.5 (assuming the missile
doesn\'t run out of surface area) and agressive baffling (chosing to
radiate all waste heat out the back, basically) reduces this to -2. 
A medium-sized military array (PEMS-14) will still detect the target
at about 500,000 km - 5 million km if it\'s already seen the 
launching ship. Further if (as I suspect) even the baby Bubba has more
than a 10 MW thruster system. Space is dark, 10 megawatt IR power plants are
bright. Once the thing shuts down it\'s much harder to detect, of 
course - it just needs a few kilowatts to power a PEMS, I suppose.
However, if it is initially detected it can be handed off to a LIDAR...
and sooner or later it needs to power up again to hit the target.
(You also might consider batteries rather than a fusion plant for
that final "oomph" while intercepting - fusion plants require a 
full half-hour BL turn to go from switched off to full power.)
Visible signature with a mil-black coating will be -2.5, so it\'ll be
detectable in visible light at 160,000 km - three minutes before 
impact. The missile\'s job does get easier if the target is surprised,
of course, and much easier if you can catch the target in a bad
sensor environment like a dusty system.

>Bubba does not use superdense armor it uses electromorhopic synthetics(sp).
>Getting the G\'s is not the problem, it is power required.
I\'m not even sure where "electromorphic synthetics" come from - CSC?
I gather you sloped the armour and only armoured the front, which makes
it vulnerable to screening vessels...and means the armour is no good
if the missile is evading (and hence presenting its side facing).

>Hmm how did you build 100 G missiles in FFS1? I don\'t remember any that
>could fit in the *standard* missile displacement.

The 100-G was just my nominal target - I wanted to design against
the worst case, in case someone like you came along :-)

>Well lets say I only need 10 percent out of each missile to hit the
>defending ship. That would mean that they would be deploying a lot earlier
>than the above range.

Let\'s say we have a 12-m diameter target (a destroyer) 
maneuvering at 4 G. If you want to hit it with 10% of your 
1000 BB\'s, you need to have your BB\'s spread out over a circle ~40 m
in diameter at the time you reach the target. However, since the
DD takes about 1.4 seconds to change its position
by 40 m, you have to deploy only ~2 seconds before impact - otherwise
the DD can get out of the way. So you deploy the BB\'s at 
about 700 km out for your 30-G missile - it\'ll have spent about 15
seconds inside the "can\'t miss" laser range before reaching this
distance.

>If a 250Mcr missile takes out of action/destroys a 1,500 Mcr warship, and

I\'m still not sure about "reusable afterwards"; assuming the target
is part of a squadron, the Bubba passes right through the 
center, desperately evading (and hence lit up like a candle), and 
exposing it\'s non-armoured sides to the other ships in the squadron.

Still, your point about relative costs is correct. Why don\'t you dredge
out your design, and post (say) MCr 1000 worth of Bubba\'s and 
carrying vessel - I\'ll see if for MCr 1000 I can design a ship
completely immune to them. 

That\'s not to say it isn\'t a good weapon system when used with 
surprise - a sleeping sensor operator and a PD system not in
automatic mode will be in serious trouble. (Like the Stark.) 
And it\'s a *great* weapon against any sort of fixed target (like a
space station) that can\'t evade.

No - in the first 10 microseconds of the 100 MJ/1 millisecond laser
pulse, 1 cm of 99.9% mirror coating absorbs about 1 kJ in a one
square centimeter area. Since that\'s fast enough for heat transport to
be negligible, the first micron or so of the coating absorbs all this 
heat - that\'s 1 kJ into ten micrograms of miracle mirror superdense,
which is pretty much guaranteed to vaporize it. The remaining 90 MJ
hit a nice not-very-shiny molten metal/plasma surface. 

(And that\'s ignoring the issue of whether you can keep a surface 
99.9% even in hard vacuum - and it has to be that reflective all  the 
way from the UV to near-IR.)

Strange that power lines are above ground. Is this bcos of the voltage

Depends on where you live.

City dwellers could substitute pigeon droppings.

However, for those of you who still want to add it:  check out Reflec
Coating (CSC p 15) which adds +3 to the armor rating vs. lasers.  It only
adds 10% to the cost and 20% to the mass of the base armor.

Speak of the devil... I\'ve been tinkering with a very early Sayat "safari
yacht", jump capable with solar sails.  The sails need to furl in order to
get into the spherical jump bubble, which is a fun problem.  No fusion,
TAKAF+, _or_ fission reactor -- all done with fuel cells, batteries, and
solar panels.  Suitable for encounter as a derelict of some sort.  Also I\'m
looking at ways of building lower-tech, in-system spacecraft.

These "old-fashioned" spaceships are a hoot... they have more character
than lots of these new-fangled boats, with displacements in even 100s of
tons, your choice of HEPlaR or T-plate, superdense hull, and a good old
fusion plant lighting it all up.

I\'m definitely going to rebuild the Gelektelkeikuttin and the
Osikattalkarai with more batteries and maybe "primitive" rocket engines.
No serious degradation of ability, of course; the Osikattalkarai should
still win the THUDDD-8 contract hands-down <G>.

Definite adventure hooks there, with the right set-up...

On this whole matter of nukephobia, I think there are other ways to create
"nuclear-free zones" on local planets.  Weird religious beliefs are an
obvious solution.  My little friends the Sayat consider nuclear physics to
be a branch of reproductive medicine (or is it the other way around?), for
example.  Fission reactions are seen as highly inauspicious and unhealthy
(in a moral and spiritual sense as well as the radiological one), because
it involves breaking up a nonconsenting, well-adjusted nucleus.  Not an
ethically acceptable action.  Using these processes to generate power?
Nonononono!  What sorts of horrible things will happen to the people who
use that energy, when _they_ try to reproduce?  Bad, bad, bad.

Fusion, on the other hand, is a wholesome, life-affirming,
nigh-upon-miraculous joy to behold and partake of: making new nuclei out of
little, lonely, incomplete ones!  Just like fetuses (feti? fetera?) are
made out of pairs of little ova!  Ain\'t it wonderful?  But, at the same
time, there\'s still something sort of numinous, sort of ontologically
dubious about the whole thing, and so the technology is best left in the
hands of people who\'ve borne at least one or two kids.  It\'s just... easier
that way.  Safer.  They know how to handle fusing better, right?  So it
keeps things from happening, you know?  What sort of things?  Well, I
dunno... just -- things.

So: no fission reactors to speak of, damn few fission warheads, and a
limited pool of potential fusion scientists, engineers and technicians.
Starships with fission power plants will not be welcome in Concourse space.
Fusion plants will be regarded as... well, as _special_, and those under
the care of un-bred persons, as probably dangerous.

Excuse me, I seem to have lost it for a minute there.  ;-)

Actually, my favorite current character is just such a person.  A retired
scout/merchant he lived in the latter days of the first Emperium and the
early days of the RoM.  He is an award winning writer in Core sector and has
a huge shipping concern.  All starting from the remnants of his personal
vessel, his data bases and a sharp mind.  I guess he can\'t complain too
much.  (snicker, snicker)

I think that\'s something of an understatement. I agree that for small TL

Don\'t feel bad; I find myself having to rederive and/or look up this kind
of thing all the time.  It\'s age + beer that does it, I think. :)

> What would the final velocity of a craft be if it accelerated at .4G for 32
> hours?

Given:

  s0, s1   = Initial and final position
  v0, v1   = Initial and final velocity
  a        = Constant acceleration
  t        = Time interval

(with all but t being vector quantities)

The following relationships apply:

  s1 = s0 + v0 t + 0.5 a t^2
  v1 = v0 + a t

Assuming linear motion, s0 = v0 = 0:

  d  = 0.5 a t^2
  v  = a t

For your case:

  a  = 4 m/s^2
  t  = 32 hr (3600 s/hr)
     = 115200 s

So:

  d  = 0.5 (4 m/s^2) (115200^2 s^2)
     = 26542080000 m
     = about 27 million km

  v  = (4 m/s^2) (115200 s)
     = 460800 m/s
     = about 460 km/s

....which goes to show you how truly awe-inspiring even just over a day of
moderate acceleration is.  That distance is about a fifth of an AU!  Not
bad for 32 hours.

A wonderful guideline for work like this is "1 g-year = lightspeed".
Ignoring relativistic effects,

  v  = (10 m/s^2) (365 * 86400 s)
     = 315360000 m/s
     = about 320,000 km/s

which is near enough to c (300,000 km/s).  Needless to say, relativistic
effects mess this up when you actually get close to lightspeed, but the
value of the guideline is that it lets you answer questions like "How fast
would a .01 g ship be moving after ten years?" easily (0.01 * 10 => 0.1c),
and accurately enough for initial design evaluation.

And *you* should be ashamed for trusting the Web on stuff like this!  As
my previous post noted, the relations are

  d = 0.5 at^2
  v = at

Simple dimensional analysis will show that v =at^2 can\'t be right; it
yields

  distance/time = (distance/time^2) time^2
  distance/time = distance    [nope]

The corrected version will work for any consistent units of distance,

Hmm grav focused lasers was an option in FFS1, and either or choice in
FFS2, not In MT or CT.

*Canon* like someone\'s preferences on *underwear*, some like boxers, some
like briefs and other like none at all. Some like striped briefs, others
like low cut *speedo* types. That is the best description of *canon* truly
is that is to each his own. Marc\'s *underwear* is most likely not what I
would choose. I like a loose and free ones, that way it is better at hiding
my *shortcomings*.<G> So when someone says something about *canon* in
Traveller, just change the word to *underwear*. 

There are at least !three! types of *underwear* for designing ships in T4
so to say what *underwear* is the official one is a farce, in light of the
T4 ship building systems *shortcomings*.

One type of *underwear* was built using FFS1, which grav focused lasers
were *optional*. Another type of *underwear* used a totally different
system, and finally the last type of *underwear* is best described nicely
as *incomplete*, but was *derived* from FFS1 again a system that grav
focused lasers were an option.

Range rate is the rate the target changes the range ie increasing or
decreasing in respect to the detecting ship. 

Thank yes I use my former naval training I was firecontrolman, just like
you are coloring your view as astronomer, I think or was that the other
Bruce? No Monty Python, Bruce comments please.<G>

This has been discussed on the GDW Beta list. Very few missiles will
approach at such an angle to give your PD battery 0 degree angle on all
three axii(sp). Most of the time the ship will have to *unmask* the PD to
give it the best angle under the conditions. Most PD\'s will be firing at
some angle on the FCS. That angle will mean any range errors will have a
effect ie hitting in front of, behind of, above etc. That does not take
into account any missile evasion/jinking, which will have a decreasing hit
chance on the FCS.

Yes a good computer can increase you chance to hit, but even LIDAR has
range errors that was discussed on the GDW-Beta list I believe very well.
LIDAR will have the smallest range errors, that would be what I would be
using for the sensor for a PD battery.

No that was 100 G\'s for half an hour, not whole hour.
No I did not use the formula below I used a large spreadsheet I had
forgotten the formula also.<G>

V = U + AT
V = final velocity (m/s)
U = initial velocity (m/s) = 0 m/s
A = constant acceleration (m/s^2) = 0.4 x 9.81 = 3.924 m/s^2
T = time (s) = 32 x 60 x 60 = 115,200 secs

But what about advanced cooling radiators option and Military Black paint?  

But what if EW is in effect typically a *barrage* jammer in front the
missile swarm, you would see the jammer but not the missile until the
jammer was rendered inop or until *burn thru* was achieved allowing the
sensor to have a chance of detecting the incoming missile(s).

Such a combat would have to be using one second turns to have it come out
right, for both sides.

They were on Dave\'s old web page prior to FFS2, but I believe that it was
compilation of new armor types from various sources. It was one the first
armor materials to have the need for power to be input to keep it
hard/tuff/etc.

I picture Bubba coming straight on its approach vector until submunitions
deployment.

OK the Big Shot submunitions modules come in three sizes:
0.1  Dt carrying    153,438 1cm ultradense ball bearings
1.0  Dt carrying  1,814,953 1cm ultradense ball bearings
10.0 Dt carrying 19,072,352 1cm ultradense ball bearings

Also Bubba carried multiple Big Shot submunitions of the two smaller sizes.

So how big would the circle be for each of the sizes then?

It also carried several nuke submunitons also of a wide variety of sizes
and yields.

Remember your PD will have to penetrate Bubba\'s armor rating? 

Also under most conditions it will be making "Bill" type attacks so that
the missile itself will not impact the target, it designed to be reusable.

100 tons at 12 g\'s for a quarter hour, very grim.

What I get only one Bubba? for one Wardship?

1000Mcr will not build a very large jump capable warship maybe what 2,000Dt?

Lets due it another way, I will build a SDB wing that will carry Bubba\'s
and may be Little Bubba\'s. You get to build a 100,000 ton ship, arm as you
see fit same for me. I would not fire Bubba\'s at non capital ships ie large
targets. I start a mercury orbit you at Pluto, just no planets or gas
giants just the Sun and thats it.

Most PD\'s are never in auto mode unless they have a target incoming, or
think they due. CIWS when I served did not have IFF, if you were a pilot of
an aircraft and in range and CIWS is in Auto with full ammmo load out, you
were toast. If we even radiated an unloaded CIWS the pilots in the area
knew it and started freaking out and whining for it to be shut off. They
gave us a very wide no fly zone until it was stowed. Some of them did not
like us even doing maintenance on CIWS ie checking electronics etc when
they were flying in the area. Thank God I was not on a carrier they had an
even more *restricted* life with CIWS.

As to the Stark there were issues that were involved that even I am not
entirely privy too.

  How about a "loose homing missile" that decides not to go off, due

Don\'t forget that that "cloud of debris is *not* going to expand to "a
few tens of metters" and *stop*. Rather, it\'s going to be expanding at
a constant speed. from a laser or PAW hit, that\'s likely to be around
1000m/s (typical shockwave propogation velocities). So 1 second after
being hit, the debris cloud will be 1 km across. 

If the missile is hit by KKM anti-missile, and the closing velocity is
much over 20 km/sec the "debris" will be a cloud of plasma!

But in space, such a course is *hideously* expensive in terms of
delta-V. It requires a large *radial* thrust. 

In space, since turns require both time and fuel, a missile can\'t
really use the standard "pursuit curve". Instead, it has to aim for
where it thinks the target will be when it gets there, and make small
vector changes to match course changes by the target. 

Remember, unlike air-to-air missiles, "vacuum-to-vacuum" missiles
*don\'t* have a major speed advantage. They have a slight *acceleration*
advantage, but pay for it by greatly decreased endurance.

This reminded me of some resin cast *models* that I\'ve seen at SF cons.
They are of classic SF movie vehicles that don\'t have standard model
kits. They are pricey as all get out though.

Upon being reminded of these, I *immediately* flashed on the "Martian
Manta" from George Pal\'s "War of the Worlds". 

It occurs to me that this might actually be a viable design for a grav
assualt vehicle of some sort. Anybody feel like designing it? If
nothing else, you could get some movie stills and have fun when the
players ask "What does it look like?" :-)

True. As noted before, the rule of thumb is that at 3 km/sec a mass has
as much kinetic energy as an equal mass of TNT. Multuply by 2 to get
the total energy if it *was* TNT. Or run it 1.4 times as fast (4.25
km/sec) to get the same energy from a solid chunk or
rock/iron/whatever. 

Since it\'d take a minor miracle to get a closing velocity that *low*,
we can safely ignore chemical explosive warheads. Explosives may still
be used to help disperse the "BBs" of a "BB warhead". But they won\'t
add appreciably to the damage.

Well,  I\'m not so sure about the guaranteed vaporization.  But
it brings up another question.  Why not have the first hit
vaporize a cloud in front of the target which the rest of the

I guess this comes down to wether this is a likely advance at

I think you missed his point. Laser weapons in CT and MT were
effective at ranges that are only possible with something like grav
focussing. It isn\'t explicit, but it makes sense given the
long-ranged direct fire combat in CT and MT.

Missiles have to be on such a course to intercept----given the
closing velocity of critters like Bubba (I *like* nasty missiles,
it keep the other guy building anti-missile weapons in place of
offensive firepower :-) they will be coming in on damn near direct
courses. "Jinking" will simply be a little sidestep to move the
missile a missile radius or two to one side or the other. The
baseline course will be bloody straight.

> T = time (s) = 32 x 60 x 60 = 115,200 secs

For half an hour time is (30min.)*(60sec/1min) = 1800 sec.
 
All that said, I dig big ole missiles. I like to call them torpedos
if they get much bigger than a ton or two, though :-)

What is a Standard computer made of ? Silicon? Hasn\'t the engineers come up

problems with silicon and other solutions are sought (even if it will take a
while).

So in my Traveller world all computers are kind of optic, or at least hybrid
computers fully configurable between storage and CPU. That means that you
have a "mass" of computer material that is perfectly configurable between
CPU and Storage (no more harddisks). If you need more processing power you
just "create" some more CPU\'s at the cost of memory capacity and vice versa.
I know this is quite far out but as someone said in the "Nukes" thread, this
isn\'t 1998 with starships.

The Commentaries on the Writings of Telor

The Word According To Isieal

Chapter 2

1	And it came to pass in those days, [circa -3526] that there went out a
decree from Ishmimkarun Kelar that all the worlds should be censused and
taxed. 
2	(And this census was first made when Ganidiirsi was governor of
Ishag.)
3	And all went to be censused, every one into her own city.
4	And Telor also went up from Lianma [Zarushagar 1727], out of the
highport of Shuubkad, into Ishag, unto the city of Tarlineal, which is
called Nena; (because she was of the house and lineage of Tarlineal.)
5	To be censused with Nagund her first husband and Dankrat her first
espoused wife.
6	And so it was that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
that she [Telor] should be censused.
7	And she brought forth, unto the Naasirka clerk Gadanla Geku, her
paperwork, and filled out the UPP section of the questionaire in
hexadecimal, because there was no room on it for decimal numbers.
8	And there were in that same office senior clerks abiding in the
building, keeping watch over the paperwork by night.
9	And lo, the paperwork of Telor came upon them, and the nonstandard
nature of her numerical nomenclature shone round them; and they were
sore afraid.
10	And [when questioned by them] Telor said unto them, Be you not afraid
for behold, I bring unto you good tidings of a more efficient way to
accurately charecterize numerical data in one numerical field for easier
machine processing while decreasing inacurate reading of one fields data
into another fields entry box, which shall be of benefit to all people.
11	For unto you is given this day in the city of Tarlineal an improved
data entry format, which is hexadecimal.
12	And it came to pass that a ruling was sent forth, only fourty seven
years later, that Telors suggestion was an infringement on the
technology patent of decimal numbering systems for data entry and she
had to pay a stiff fine.
13	And it came to pass that the researcher caste revised their standard
data entry forms to use hexadecimal numbers for data entry.

This concludes todays readings from the Commentaries on the works of
Telor: Isieal Chapter 2, Verses 1 to 13. [1 + 3 = 4]

> How does this interface with your understanding of fourness?

Yes 16 = 4 x 4 but equally importantly it is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 
[which is mathematically equal but spiritually different.]

Yes !

You, Madam or Sir, have achieved enlightenment by understanding the
important nature of the second most important number (after 4) that
exists.  You have however forgotten that Ishag takes 256 days to circle
the sun, reflecting the 256 ways enlightenment may come upon us.  

Naturally to reflect and honor these 256 ways of enlightenment we
Darmine use 256 useage names to reflect these 256 ways to knowledge.  As
our population grew more dense it came to pass that 256 names were not
allways enough to identify people and the custom of referring to the
individual as _____ dehah [child of] Mothers name came into being, circa
4^4 x 4 x 4 [4,096] years ago.

That amused me when I read about it a while back, especially when I then

I fail to see the causal connection here Kenji.  Just because the pink
Vargr was real does not mean that you had to believe what the voices
told you about him. :)

In my Third Imperium studded collars, little bow ties of chartreuse
velveteen with burgundy polka-dots, and whisker mascara ar what 
therespectable business Vargr wear.  It should be fairly obvious that no
Vargr is going to be able to shock other Vargr through ther clothing
choices.  Punk Vargr typically go in for largescale dying and/or shaving
of their fur.  This is out of the mainstream because it alters the way
that the fur is used as a social communications device which is
important to the statuc conscious Vargr.  Normal everyday Vargr may go
in for perms, weaves, ribbons, etc in their fur but will not alter the
fur itself to any great degree.

[snip of his comments/complaints about IG\'s not shipping items he has
been charged for]

Several other people have complained that IG is charging them for items
before, often well before, they ship them.

Why are you choosing to have IG send you the products mail order ?  Some
of you are owed products by IG but I do not see why you continue to
stick with them for new products.  You could instead have someone else
send you the items mail order.  Naturally you won\'t be able to get
anything until IG prints it but this is true everwhere.  Good games
shops do _not_ charge you for items before they ship them.  At the game
store I order for, Bosco\'s [and most everywhere else]

www.boscos.com

info@boscos.com

we do not ever charge peoples credit cards until we pack up their
products to go, the products then ship that day or the next day.  It is
true that _theoretically_ you should be getting things sooner if you
order them directly from IG than if you order them from a retailer who
has to wait for the products to go from IG to the distributor, to the
retailer, but it seems quite clear to me that this is not happening.  We
ship everwhere in the world and I know a lot of other places on the net
do as well.  I would have said this months ago but it seemed to me that
it might 1) sound too much like an ad for my store, 2) be obvious
anyway, and 3) that IG might get its act together.  We are not perfect
but on those rare occasions when we make an error we try to rectify it.

We do not have a vast collection of OP Traveller items but we do have
some.  We also carry the full line of T4 products (except Starships....)
Since we also carry lots of other cool games and non games you can have
other things you want sent to you as part of the same order thereby
saving money on per item shipping.
  
PS to the gamer in Canada who noted that Canadian Customs charged him a
$5 Canadian fee since the MT Journal we sent him did not have a customs
declaration slip on it [due to error by a person at our warehouse]
mention this on your next order with us and I\'ll see that you get a $5
US credit on your order, I meant to mention this to you earlier but I
deleted your email accidently.  If you had responded to the store rather
than to me they could have taken care of it sooner.

If you do not get the service you like from IG then do not deal with IG.

I believe that Aliens Vol 1 is scheduled for sometime this year and that

From memory:
Aslan +1 Str, -1 Dex, +1 End - Culture based on honour (sort of a cross
between the Samurai and Klingon, though don\'t take that too litterally)
Strong sex role differentiation Males = Warrior, Female = Everything else
Massive territorial drive

Vargr -1 Str, +1 Dex, -1 End - Culture decentrallised and unstable. Based
around the concept of "Charisma" which is much like the Maori concept of
Mana; heavy pack mentality (think hormone driven teenager)

Geonee - Minor Human race, Homeworld Shiwonee/Massila 1430
         Talent for technical skills, developed jump drive from recovered

Suerrat - Minor Human race, Homeworld Ilelish/Ilelish 2907
          Established an interstellar state based on sublight generation ships
          Have an large pocket empire in M:0, opposed to the Imperium.

IMHO neither of these races are likely to be major factors in Core Sector,
but as you get to the frontiers the situation will change.

Yes it does.  Were you not yet on the list when we discussed this last
spring ?  You see the whole Traveller universe is a struggle between the
Ancients and the Hivers [who equate to Cthulhu mythos figures] to get to
and control the center of the universe District 268 of the Spinward
Marches [If I were still pretending to be a Darmine I would note that  
2 + 6 + 8 = 16 which is highly significant.]  The Masons are just one of
their lacky groups.  This truth was revealed by the enlightened Craig
Barry and I was merely a spectator to his greatness :)

	Does anyone out there feel up to producing the Traveller Universe
version of the Illumiati Card Game [not the CCG] ?  Haven\'t you all been
dying to say stuff like "Grandfather is making a privilidged attack to
control on The Sword Worlders using Hortalez et Cie, since he also
controls THe Solomani Party the attack automatically gets a  +2." :)

> Whats next, a proof of how jump engines are powered by sacred geometry?

Well Carlos Alos-Ferrer  a Mathematician and former TMLer posted this
Jump Drive Theory last spring that seems to meet your specifications

< <   
         An introduction to Yet Another Jumspace Theory
         ==============================================
 
      The structure of the set of transfinite numbers reflects the
physical reality. There is a bijection between the set of transfinite
numbers and the set of physical spaces. Aleph-0 is associated to real
space, while Aleph-n (for n>=1) corresponds to Jumpspace-n. Basically,
the  corresponding cardinal measures the possible "meta-quantum
situations" that  a particle can be in, in the corresponding space. A
"meta-quantum situation"  is a complete specification of energy level,
probability distribution over  location, and all other necessary
physical characteristics.
         The lanthanum grid has the effect of exponentially increasing
the variance of meta-quantum situations in the particles of a body. In
the limit, the body cannot be contained in its space and so "jumps" into
the appropriate one.
         The set of transfinite numbers is discrete only if the
continuum hypothesis is accepted. The discovery of jumpspace requires a
deep understanding of the transfinite number theory. Those races who do
not incorporate as an assumption the continuum hypothesis have failed to
discover the jump-drive.

Hmm. How about downloading the equations from Alcubierre\'s paper? (He\'s
the guy who has proposed a *real* "warp drive"). A page or two of
tensor calculus ought to do the trick just fine. 

Or grab a copy of Blish\'s "Cities in Flight" and toss the spindizzy
equation at them.

V = A * T.

..4 g = 4 m/s^2. 
32 hours = 1152,000 seconds. 
V = 460.8 km/sec.

Alas, the above is *wrong. Just check the units.

V is in m/s. A is in m/s^2, and T is in s. That gives us:

m/s = (m/s^2) * s^2
m/s = m*s^2/s^2
m/s = m

Doesn\'t balance. 

The formula for *distance* is D=.5*A*T^2.
m = (m/s^2) * s^2
m = m*s^2/s^2
m = m

The formula for *velocity* is V=A*T
m/s = (m/s^2) * s
m/s = m*s/s^2
m/s = m/s

They can go a *lot* farther with "spiked hair" and shaved/colored hair
patterns.

And given how important scent likely is, I expect that they\'d *really*
be into colognes and perfumes, perhaps with odors that humand find
offensive!

Who says that jump bubbles are spherical? We know that they are only a
fewmeters from the hull of normal ships, and it\'s implied that this is
regardless of shape.

So if you can weave a fine lathanum wire grid into the sail and the
support cables, you may be able to go into jump without taking in the
sail. The hard part is keepinf it from collapsing or tangling hile inm
jumpspace. It\'s possible that a bright spotlight would provide enough
"push" to keep the sail taut.

Don\'t forget that all fissionable isotopes *spontaneously* fission at a
measureable rate. We just encourage them do "do what comes naturally"
more often.

Remember, this is *not* something peacefully evaporating. Due to the
energy levels involved it is *explosively* converted into plasma. With
results much like applying the same amount of energy via an explosive
charge. So that "spot" is going to be *at least* equivalent to a stick
of dynamite going off.

It strains physics pretty badly though. It itt not only has to be
perfect, it has to be so hard it doesn\'t get scratched *and* it has to
somehow *repel* dust specs, as well as "vapor" from vaporized
materials (otherwise they\'ll condense on it),

Nope, you forgot the ".4" Your calc above is for 9.8 m/s^2, not 3.92.

Ok, this one has some serious problems in that the energy required for
a given delta-V depends on your velocity relastive to whatever you are
"pushing" against. This is required for conservation of energy. That
is, if you double your speed you have to use 4 times the energy. <sigh>

If you want to try this, email me and I\'ll send you the formulas we
derived for Accel, velocity, and time to cover a distance with a
constant expenditure of energy.

Not true. If the particles have low momentum (not mass, as photons have
a zero rest mass, but can transfer momentum), you just have to use
*more* of them.

The Classic Traveller rules actually imply a fusion rocket! High Guard
or Striker makes reference to using your exhaust as a weapon!

however it\'s nowhere near the speed of light (c)
299,792,458 m per second is 1,079,252,849 km per hour
your speed is  1,658,880 / 1,079,252,849 of the speed of light

But then by the same standard, so to speak, plasma weapons were usuable in

I asked earlier if it was reasonable to use nuclear dampers for shutting
down fusion plants (it was not) but one could arguable use them to detonate
your enemies nuclear warheads if range allows. Any ideas on the range of
nuclear dampers? Mercenaries (and Striker?) has their range being a mutiple
of the separation between the generators which is a bit too good to be true
but...

That reminds me. I once worked as a quality control chemist for Avon (the
cosmetics people). We tested the raw ingredients in our lab, and every
different ingredient had a series of tests to do, some on every container, 
shipment, lot, etc. On of the things we had to test on every lot was the
refined lanolin, a _taste_ test to make sure it wasn\'t rancid.

 Now refined lanolin doesn\'t _quite_ smell like a sheep camp at the end of
summer, but it\'s pretty close. Avon had about 6 labs around the world
doing this testing...we use to spend _lots_ of long distance time calling
all the other labs to see if someone had tested that lot already...

I thought missiles were stored in industrial vacuum at low temperatures to
make their IR sigs small when launched. As for their launch envirinment:
They\'re launched into space which make industrial vacuum seem dense by
comparison.

I do agree that mirriring missiles would not work very well as the first
hit may reflect a lot and the rest would vaporize some of the mirror
surface which would then condense upon the missile and ruining the rest of
the surface when further hits come along. Condensing vaporized metal also
does not so nice things to the missiles comms and sensors...

That being dense plasma behaves lie a very good metal ie reflects photons
quite good? I think I saw something about that problem while Reagans Star

length - the shorter the pulse the harder for the plasma to shield.

Wow...designing low tech ships are hard...maybe thats why NASA hasn\'t
designed a starship yet :P

I\'m still working on my low-tech colony ship, and I have some questions...
What is the feasability of the various fuel types lasting in tanks for
centuries?

I ask, of course, because a colony ship\'s flight time could well be measured
in centuries, and the power plant (at the very least) would need to continue
running (if only to support the low berths). Also, if the ship is gonna
stop, it needs to save roughly half its drive fuel for the turnaround and
deceleration portion. It was my understanding that liquid hydrogen would
boil off or bleed out of the tanks eventually.

Is that true? What about deuterium, the fuel for low-tech fusion drives.

And for fission drives - what\'s the half-life of their fuel? Would their
stores still be good after centuries?

I\'m assuming my thermonuclear pulse pellets, being solid, would still be
okay.

The biggest problem I\'m running into now is power. I got my design worked
out so that it requires just under 20MW of power. Sounds simple. Just drop
in a small 20MW fission reactor. Works like a charm (this is at TL9).
The problem is mass, particularly for the fuel. A true generation/sleeper
ship is going to need fuel in the range of centuries/millenia - and
radioactives are HEAVY. When I put in 2000 years worth of radioactives on
the ship (which brings up a whole slew of problems, I know...but that\'s
beside the point), the power plant fuel is nearly 2/3 the mass of the ship.

None of the other power sources work well - fusion is too big at TL9, and
none of the other types are rated in years. Is there a way to have a closed
circuit fuel cell? You know, the kind that generates water as its reaction,
then re-cracks the water along the way to reuse the fuel. Or is the power to
crack the water prohibitive. Could you have a fuel-cell/battery combo that
was constantly cracking/combining water? I imagine the plant would have be
bigger than 20MW, to handle the inefficiency. But this still might be a
better idea...

Note: I\'m not an engineer or scientist, so if this is way off base, I
apologize for offending people\'s sensibilities :)

If you can keep the cooling apparatus working you can keep the LHyd there

There\'s no differance for deuterium.

What do you need power for besides the low passages? How many colonists are
you sending and how many will be awake to do maintenance etc. This is
really interesting stuff, keep up updated on your project.

A closed circuit fuel cell would (of course) be impossible. You need more
power to crack the water than you\'d get from uncracking it in the fuel
cell.

I guess I\'d been thinking that large-scale dyeing, shaving, braiding,
dread-ing, etc. _were_ mainstream Vargr stuff -- or at least "high fashion"
styles.  Your disaffected underclass Vargr pup rebels by trying to look
like a respectable elderly Solomani banker.  Without much success, of
course, but it\'s the thought that counts.

Ah, that\'s part of my local-color handwave for the Sayat.  They use a
different jump technology (same "jumpspace" as the Impy dogs, just
different machine to get there) which creates a perfectly spherical jump
bubble, only.

Tubb and Dumarest.  Thanks too to Bloo who provided the handy booklist.

Inspired by this, I wondered off to a local second hand bookshop - the
delightful kind where the book are piled high all over the place and you
usually need to wash your hands thoroughly after you\'ve visited and the
little old lady staffing the shop wouldn\'t care two hoots if you set up
base camp on the first floor for an assault on the higher shelves towards
the back - in the hope that they might have some of the series.

Lo and behold, the very first in the series - The Winds of Gath -was there.
I quickly bought and devoured it on the bus home last night in just and
hour and three quarters.  Excellent, and as promised all those Traveller
like features that made me feel I was actually reading a decent Traveller
novel:

Low Passage (Tubb gave his Low Travellers a 15% chance of dying which is
just about the CT roll of 5+)
High Passage
Fast drug
Slow drug
Medicine drug
Nobles
Matriarchal societies
Vast empire spanning thousands of worlds


Needless to say, I returned today to obtain later volumes in the series.
(Sadly only a half dozen or so).  If anyone wants one of the 4 copies of
The Winds of Gath that was kicking around over there, I\'d be willing to buy
one and post it.  (I\'m guessing it would be $10 inc post and packing to the
States).  Let me know if you can\'t track one down locally and would like
it.


Interestingly enough, given that Tubb is a UK author it would explain the
spelling of Traveller with two \'l\'s.  He refers several times in the first
volume to Travellers being a breed apart.  Evidently Marc was influenced by
the milieu and adopted Tubb\'s spelling as well.

Anyway, thanks again for starting me off on the Dumarest saga and if anyone
else out there hasn\'t tried it - take it from a new convert, at least give
the first one a shot, you won\'t be disappointed!

Given what our *unevolved* puppy companions find acceptable, even 
interesting and sexy, in terms of odors (my Husky once found her way into 
an old vat that was used to age cheese whey... BLEARRGGHH!) I\'d say this 
was quite possible (though it might be interesting to have them intrigued 
by the same sort of scents we do... thus, when the players, on their 
first run into Vargr space on one of the first trading missions, bring 
plenty of Eau de PoissonMort, thinking to outsmart their GM, they can be 
in for a real shock).

(a worst-case scenario)
"fast thinking" Solomani trader; "And we brought perfumes!" (holds out 
spary bottle)

<sniff>

<sounds of Vargr painfully retching in corner, as traders look on in horror>

<Vargr translator dutifully notes that "perfume" translates into Vargr 
equivalent of "Mace/retch gas">

(we will delete the resultant debates/criminal trial as "fast-thinking" 
Traders are tried for importing chemical weapons to a foreign power...)

Hmmm... your argument has merit! However if the target is evading (and most

Doesn\'t the old CT Mercenary description of dampers imply they can cause a

Chemical separation of waste from fuel rods (Pu/U/waste) is a reality from
current reactor material. In the UK Sizewell B (our first and only
commercial power PWR) the first reactor load out was with recycled
material.

The UK AGR was a damn fine reactor  (>42% efficient with online refueling)
*once* they stopped changing the design with each new station.
Unfortunately, the decision to buy a Westinghouse design to replace them
was already taken by her who must be obeyed.

educational opportunities at MIT.  There are lots of one-day seminars,
tours, and other activities which are perfect for lay-persons to get an
introduction to the subjects taught or researched at different departments.


Below this message is my department\'s schedule.  PSFC opens it\'s talks to
the public at large and I want to personally invite all the folks on this

The particularly interesting events are (1) Tours of Alcator C-Mod, an
experimental fusion reactor (well, really its an experimental plasma
containment chamber, but why split hairs?) on 1/22 at 2:00pm, and Tour of
the ITER Central Solenoid Model Coil Fabrication Site, the beginning of
another Fusion Reactor\'s construciton on January 27, at 2:00 pm.

Location is at the MIT PSFC, on Albany St, in Cambridge, MA.  Email or call

That\'s part of why the laser pulses are so short - there\'s no time
for such a cloud to form and expand and decouple from the substance.
Whether the traveller laser damage rules are reasonable overall is
harder for me to evaluate, but the basic principle is sound.

I have imagined just such an engine, while reading the above.  What if you
were to arrange 4 sections of artificial gravity grids as illustrated below:

Then place a coil of tubing inside the grid arangement.  As the fuel
(expectorant?) moved around the tube, it would accellerate.  Viola, you have
the system described above.  Actually, I think I would use two coils with an
inlet on either end and the outlets on the opposit ends.

>You\'d also have to match the power consumtion figures which I assure you
>would break gloriously. TANSTAFL reigns sumpreme (at least in the real
>world).

Let\'s see, if the ship you mounted the X-engine (anyone got a better name,
I\'m open to suggestions), were 10 m wide and you wanted the grids to be say
1 m wide, it would take up 40 cumet plus 3x.003x40=.36 cumet for the
equipment  The power requirement (at TL 12) would be .36x.7=.252 MW.  Let\'s
see what we get out of it.  The acceleration is not uniform.  If I
understand how these things work properly, it would be between 0 and 1 times
the grid strength (3 G).  I think the proper mathematics escapes me just
now.  However, I have had another thought, why use 4 1x10 grids when you
could use a larger number of narrower grids set perpendicular to a set of
tangents of the tube.  (I know I\'ve lost some of you, but hang on.)

That will require more thought.  Let\'s say for the sake of argument that you
could get the average acceleration up to 25 m/s/s and the inside of the tube
was 14 square cm in cross-section, with a wall thickness of say 2 mm, then
the tube would be c. 2.111/3 cm i.d./o.d.  It would have a center length of
over 2 km (c. 2,063.0 m).

Let\'s see, the formula given in several posts of late was D=A/2xTxT.  So,
T=SQR(2D/A)=
SQR(2 x  c. 2063/25)=SQR(c 165)=c 12.85 seconds.  Hmmm, V=AT=25 x c.
12.85=c. 321 m/s.  That\'s not very fast.  I know let\'s put coils inside of
coils (after all there\'s a lot of empty space in there...  So, if I wanted 2
that would be +1.91... 3 would be +1.85, 4 +1.79, 5 +1.73 let\'s say we go
down to .95 that would give us...  (1.97-.95)/.03= 34 coils with an average
length of (1.97+.95)Pi/2=c. 9.17 m then multiply by 34x1000/3 gives an over
all length of c. 104.0 km (103,966 m)  That\'s better.

T=SQR(2D/A)=SQR(103,966X2/25)=c. 8,317 seconds : V=AT=8,317x25=c. 207,932
m/s/s

(watching a creative mind at work is scary isn\'t it)

still not enough.

Your right, it won\'t work on these scales.  However, IF you were building on
a large asteroid...

Never mind, that\'s another thread.

Look, *every* kind of traveller has long-range lasers; you have to allow
me to use them in defending against missiles or you\'re just not playing
Traveller. It\'s just that it wasn\'t until TNE that they realized such
lasers violated the laws of physics and had to introduce grav focus to
explain them. And in FFS1, while it does call it an "option", it states
explicitly that it\'s an option that\'s part of the mainstream Imperial
Traveller universe.

Except, perhaps, for one that\'s about to hit you? If it\'s about
to hit you, it\'s coming straight at you. 

>Most PD\'s will be firing at
>some angle on the FCS. That angle will mean any range errors will have a

I really, really, really don\'t think you understand the difference
between the speed of light (300,000 km/s) and the speed of your missile
(1000 km/s.)
Getting the range right is very important at long ranges. It matters
much less at very short ranges, and much less when the target is
heading towards you rather than away. A good LIDAR should have range
(timing) errors around a microsecond, even at TL-7. That means that
even if your missile is travelling sideways at 1000 km/s, I\'ll get
the "lead" wrong by (1 microsecond) * (1000 km/s) = 1 meter, smaller
than a typical missile - and that\'s the *worst* case; if you\'re
heading even 10 degrees away from straight towards me the error is a
tenth of a meter.

Get this through your head: this is *not* like firing missiles or guns
at other missiles on a surface ship. Laser pulses travel hundreds of
times faster than missiles. It\'s like firing a M1\'s hypervelocity
gun at a person who is walking.

>into account any missile evasion/jinking, which will have a decreasing hit
>chance on the FCS.
That\'s where the "can\'t miss" range comes in; at around 10,000 km
(depending on the accel and size of the missile) evasion and jinking
is too slow compared to the travel time of the laser pulse - even if
the fire control ignores the jinking and assumes the missile travels
at a constant speed it\'ll hit, because in the 1/30th of a second
it takes the laser pulse to get there even a 30-G missile can only
change its predicted position by about 0.3 meters.

>But what about advanced cooling radiators option and Military Black paint?
Those numbers included advanced (TL-12) masking and military black
(TL-12) paint.

Jamming passive sensors is something you and I have argued about 
before...certainly I don\'t believe in a barrage jammer that can jam
passive sensors or LIDAR, except for another laser bright enough to
blind the sensors, which has to be a *very* big laser to blind all
the dispersed sensor elements on a big warship. My general feeling is
that things like this only work if you have a TL advantage.

>I picture Bubba coming straight on its approach vector until submunitions
>deployment.
Make up your mind! You were talking above about the missile \'jinking
and evading\' and about the \'range rate\' and azimuthal motion of the
missile - now you want it to come straight in to keep the front armour
pointed at the target. You definitely can\'t have it both ways - and
if you\'re coming \'straight in\' the fire control problem becomes
trivial. If you aren\'t coming straight in, sooner or later you 
have to expose the sides of the missile as it turns to maneuver.

Note also that you have to match the acceleration/evasion of the
target - you can\'t just coast in - so overall, I think keeping only
the front armour showing is impractical.

>So how big would the circle be for each of the sizes then?
>[eg] 1.0  Dt carrying  1,814,953 1cm ultradense ball bearings

You said you wanted 10% of the ball bearings to hit - the circle size
is then independent of the number of bearings. If you can settle for
0.1% (which you probably can, if you have a million of them) the
circle gets ten times bigger and the deployment time can be 
square root (10) times = 3 times earlier. Overall, deployment time
goes as the percentage you want to hit to the -1/4 power - it\'s very
hard to win back much deployment time. (IE if you wanted only *10*
ball bearings out of 1 million to hit, the deployment time goes 
up to about 20 seconds, or 7000 km for the 10-G big version.)

I think we definitely have to have a price threshold rather than 
tonnage. I was trying to simplify the problem - I\'m not up to designing
100,000 dTon of ship in my copious spare time. How about MCr 10,000?
That\'ll buy you a couple of SDB\'s and a bunch of death missiles, and
me a decent destroyer/light cruiser.

And, just to be fair, let\'s start an AU apart around earth orbit - 
starting you at mercury gives you an advantage coming out of the sun.

  A = 100 x 9.98 = 998 m/s^2 (100g)
  T = 30 min = 1800 s

  V = 1800 x 998 = 1,796,400 m/s (1796.4 km/s)

   You\'re missing the point - we can build 99.9% reflective surfaces
_now_, it\'s _keeping_ them reflective that\'s the problem. Consider what
one speck of dust or a thumbprint does to your nicely reflective
surface...

  Is there any reason then, that the warhead has to be a warhead?  Can\'t it
be something else like an ECM package?

Two points:

In general, the attackers outnumber the defenders, because they can
concentrate forces.  Sometimes, the defenders fool the attackers about how
many people are defending a given point, which makes it possible to fool
the attacker into a losing struggle.  As a rule, though, give the attacking
force more cash than the defenders for a decent wargame.  If it is a
superior system in the usual attacker advantage situation, then the
defender is ecstatic.  Of course, it would excel at smashing fixed defenses
that cannot evade.

Second question - why start at Pluto?  This gives the advantage to the
defender, as you then have days of detection and boost time.  Traveller
physics means that you are more likely to have to work within 100d limits.

Other than those caveats, I am quite looking forward to seeing the TCr
fleets you both put together.  I know Bruce designs better ships than I do,
and I would like to see what he comes up with to oppose these weapons systems.

George R.R. Martin makes effective use of the Catholic Church in space in
his short story - "The Way of Cross and Dragon" ("Sandkings" (c)Baen Book
1986). It involves the \'Grand Inquisitor of the Order Militant of the
Knights of Jesus Christ\' (whois also an alien, a Cardinal, and the
Archbishop of Vess - a planet) - he is addressed as \'Lord Commander\' by
those within the Order (those below him in the Order are known as \'Knights
Inquisitors\'). Also mentioned is the \'Order of St. Christopher the
Far-Travelling\' a monastic Order of Monks, Brothers, and Nuns who crew a
fleet of starships for the use of the Church in its missions to all the
far-flung worlds of Martins \'Thousand Suns\' universe. And lastly, the \'Order
of St. Judas Iscariot\' around whom the story centers.
Like all of Martins SF, it is well worth reading.

Another author who makes (fairly) effective use of The Church in space is
John Maddox Roberts in his novel "Cestus Dei" and involves the task of \'a
combat-trained Jesuit missionary\' (drawing on the Jesuit\'s being founded by
an ex-soldier as someone else mentioned) to bring a newly rediscovered \'lost
colony\' world back into the fold (without resorting to nukes ;).

George R.R. Martin also makes effective use of faith\'s of his own devising 
in many of his short stories. Some of these are:

   "Sons of the Dreamer" - A faith that teaches \'physical pacifism and
psychological agression\'.
   "Steel Angels"        - (a.k.a. "Children of Bakkalon") Faith is
                           militant and xenophobic towards nonhumans.
   "Erikaners"           - A faith that espouses immortality through 
                           cloning.
   "Liars"               - (actual name remains a secret) A secretive, 
                           Masonic like faith/organization.
   "Cult of the Union"   - An alien faith with human converts. Adherants 
                           seek physical \'Union\' with alien parasitic 
                           growth, that eventually absorbs their body 
                           while the mind lives on.

The main weapon system are missiles called "combat wasps" - highly autominous,

ECM. Other technology (sensors, jump drive, maneuver capabilities) are
fairly Traveller like. The books are very uneven overall - a strange plot
with possibly too much gratuitous sex and violence - but the space combat
parts are *great*. (They also have way cool bioengineered living starships

Well it is kinda explicit in MT... at least in the SoM (I\'ve finally been able

All right.  What goes around comes around.  I, too, have now been stared at

  Communications: 6xRadio (1,000AU). 6xLaser (1,000AU).
  Sensors: 6xPas. Scanner (14 [50mkm]). 6xPas. Tracker (13 [5mkm]). 6xRadar
(11 [.16mkm]).
  Power: 60MW Fission.

Crew Details:
  Special. Zero crew, robot operated.

This ship carries 1000 adult colonists and  40std worth of frozen embryos
(human and animal). The ship is driven by a Nuclear Pulse drive that can
fire at full thrust for 195 hours. This burn would be split in half, to 97.5
hours - just over 4 days, to ensure that there was enough fuel at the end of
the trip to decelerate (perhaps less could be used, and some sort of
gravity-assisted deceleration could be implemented, allowing more fuel for
the acceleration burn). The ship is completely FF&S legal, except that I
handwave the crew away. I simply installed three computers for each section
(Drives, Commo, Sensors, Power, Life Support) and installed the workstations
(subcomputers) -and assume that the whole thing is automated, with some
robots.

Thanks to all the people who gave me the silly v=at formula that I forgot,
we can see that this ship reaches:

V = .4G x 9.81m/s^2 x 97.5hr x 3600s/hr = 1,377,324m/s, or roughly
1,377km/s.

Comparing to c (299,792,458m/s), we see that V/c = .0045, or roughly 0.45%
the speed of light.

Thus, it can travel 0.0045 ly a year, or 9ly in its operational (2000yr)
lifetime.

Not real good.

If we devote the entire burn to acceleration, we get

V = .4g x 9.81m/s^2 x 195hr x 3600s/hr = 2,754,648m/s or .009c.

This gives a range of 18ly. Still not impressive, plus - how are you going
to stop?

When I say these aren\'t impressive, I don\'t mean that literally - 9ly is
quite impressive. But in the Traveller universe, we\'ve got ships that travel
much farther than that using STL - like the C-Jammer from Trillion Credit
Squadron.

The problem, of course, is mass. For this ship, the mass is tied up in three
things - drive, power plant fuel, hull. The drive is pretty much
untouchable - so we have to play with power plant fuel and hull mass. You
can lower the hull mass by changing from a asteroid hull to a ceramic hull -
but could a TL9 culture build a 50,000std craft? If so, this is an easy
route - changing to a constructed hull kicks the acceleration up to .6G, and
gives you 121.2G-hours of thrust - 202 hours of .6G thrust. Splitting it in
half (for deceleration) gives .007c - using the full fuel load results in
..014c, we crossed the 1% barrier (wheeeee!) The range of the ship would be
14ly and 28ly respectively.

For its volume, the largest mass is the fission fuel. It is nearly half the
weight of the ship, while only being 1.7% of the volume. Clearly some other
power system would be beneficial. But what? Fusion is too big at TL 9.

A power breakdown of the ship is as following:

33.01MW for the controls.
..2MW for communications.
3.01MW for sensors.
10.01MW for the labs and sickbay.
1.01MW for the berths and quarters.
and 12.13MW for life support.

The controls are untouchable - the computers and controls need to be active
always, so that the computers can react to any problems. The communications
and sensors could be intermittent - just turn them on now and then to check
for something. Then again, I wouldn\'t want to miss that big rock that\'s
about to hit the ship....
The lab and sickbay can definately be powered down when no one is awake.
The low berths need to be powered, of course.
The life support needs to be powered as well - since the ship must be able
to support people at any point along its 2000 year mission, endurance LS is
the only way to go. This design has a garden capable of supporting 20 people
at a time - this garden would be tended by robots and cultivated over the
years.

Note that this design is not perfect or finished - I want to add machine
shops (to take care of the robots) and do some more tweaking.

Any comments or ideas?

Should it not be 998m/sec^2 equaling 996,004 m/s
then 996, 004 m/s times 1800 secs equales 1,792,807,200 or 1,792,807 Km/sec

We have the ship in orbit.  It is getting ready to "launch".  In order 
to increase its legs, what if you were to add booster rockets or some

way?  Perhaps pusher type tugs could get some initial inertia going and

Assuming that they have both contragravity and artificial gravity

A superior force could be very large *commerce* raider type of raid. The a

I was my first offer in terms of the setup locations, I would close the
ranges in negotiations.

Ok then I would concentrate at the locations that will allow a incoming
ships to jump in, In fully planeted etc solar system how many would there
be and where. Lets not count the Oort cloud in this for now.

But then why not a hand wave for the plasma guns? Alot of things in FFS1
were put there to make it a *neater* war game, like HEPLAR thrust. This is
direct quote from the "Gods of Traveller at the Time" at the last con in

M is missile, X is defending PD laser battery, V is missile direction of
travel, \\ is the laser beam\'s path, -- is hull of defending ship. 

As you can see the missile is going to intercept the ships hull at the
forward part, the PD battery will be firing at an angle to hit the missile
along its path of travel. Yes the angle will not be this clean unless the
defending ship is very large.

The missile is coming straight at the ship not the PD battery unless the
ship is *point* in space

That is the speed only when the missile starts accelling after accelerating
for a period of time will it be going faster than its accel rate of 1,000
km/s?

At what range is the above example? The laser will be firing a wide pattern
at longer ranges but it will still be firing a very tight pattern even at
short ranges.

Ok get this thru you head: this is *not* astronomy 101 either.<G> I would
have thought that light travels thousands of times faster than light.<G>

At the range you list above the missile will have deployed its submunitons
and there will be 100,000\'s of them, at such short range above, your PD ROF
will be to small to get them all.

Yes but then can the PD pen/dam the missile in question? If the missile is
leaving after submunitons deployment, target is DOA anyway.

Whether or not you believe being possible or not, it will be there. The
Military will spend Billions Cr over 5,000 years to find a way to do it.
Why? because it will give the side that has it a strong edge in battles.
The solution my side step what we consider *rules* of physics at al like
the jump drive making it possible for travel greater than the speed of
light. They did not violote the rules, they changed the rules. 

I have seen EW do things that those in the civilian world would say is
impossible and give good arguments as to why it is impossible. Yes a higher
TL you have a reducing effect on the jammer.

Bubba does not evade but Little Bubba does.

Again straight in to target\'s hull, not the PD battery. I has been mentions
in other message that corkscrew approach is a good possibility to get it
both ways.

Ok another crude example:

Match the targets movements? I am trying to intercept not board it.<G> 
The side armor will get exposed so what it will be proof against PD lasers
fire.

Where did you arrive at the above figures? They seem way off.

With 1,000,000 plus BB\'s I can release them in such a way to put one in
every square meter
disk at a very long range.

Now how big will that disk be? bigger than you example.

Not in my view either, a price ceiling does not interest me. Then we will

Ok then I will be off at the three or nine o\'clock positions in mercury\'s
orbit, twelve position would have the sun directly behind it, six o\'clock
would be behind the sun.

It is 998 Meters _per_ second _per_ second. _Not_ 998 _squared_
meters per second.

You apparently keep doing 998^2, then tagging on the units (units
being meters and seconds).

The meters and seconds go _with_ the number, they don\'t operate on
it.

So when you have something like x=at^2, the Time, "t" is squared. So
you might have (2seconds)^2 = 2^2seconds^2 = 4seconds^2

It can\'t be done for plasma guns, that\'s why. Save what you can,
ditch the rest.

It was doable withing traveller tech to make grav focussing for
lasers, not plasma.

The distance between the hull nad the missile is suh that the angle
will be a fraction of a degree. Do the math. It won\'t look as you
suggest until it extremely close.

But the above is besides the point. From the perspective of the
*laser* it is a straight line. At all times. At anti-missile ranges
the travel time for tthe laser is tiny compared to the movement of
the missile, so it ia always a straight line at 0 angle from the
laser.

At the distances we\'re talking about, it is effectively a point.

The submunition will need to have a *huge* delta v to do this. Even
huge compared to Bubba. Really.

You have to be at the same place at the same time. It is a kind of
matching. Intercept is a better word, but he\'s trying to get a point
across and can\'t be sure you use the words the same way.

Price is all that matters. If it is cheaper in the long run to
defend, they won\'t get use----much. I think big missiles will exist
since it forces the other guy to defend even if you don\'t use many.

 The \'STEN\' series by Alan Cole and Chris Bunch also have some pretty good
\'ship-killer\' class missiles and decent write-ups of the space battles using
\'em.

Nahh. Lasers are small and cheap. It\'s the power plant that costs the
megacredits. And if you spread the power out over time by using batteries,
you can evade that problem to a great extent.

Grav focussing doesnt appear optional any more. It appears standard.

Non grav focussed lasers are IMO pretty useless until TL13.

The ones who havent yet blossomed, and are in range. Nuke dampers can be

PD meson gun to deal with very very very thickly armoured missiles. But

Using the spinal mount is an emergency measure - but it is there as part of

Yeah ... the problem is generating your "peak power need" for a ship with
lots of point defense lasers. Batteries are the efficient solution IMO, at
least as opposed to buying a bigger power plant you dont use most of the
time. 

A TL11 250 MJ 1 m2 area focal array laser with ROF 800 per 30 mins is very
roughly 20 m3 of laser, 72 m3 of accumulator. Power demand is high, at
(800x1250 MJ) or 1000000 MJ per 1800 seconds, or roughly 550 megawatts per
second over the 30 minutes.

That needs call it 350 m3 of TL12 1 hour discarge batteries.

Total is 450 m3 or so - about, what 35 displacement tons. Mass is on the
high side, at ummm 900 tons or so. Cost is pretty damn reasonable - call it
MCr 2 for the batteries, MCr 0.75 for the accumulator, call it MCr 0.5 for
the laser with markup, MCr 0.2 for a 30 kkm beam pointer - cost is still
dominated by a MFD.

We are talking about engaging KKMs at a minimum range of 1000km. The
problem is pointing accurately enough - it isnt a problem of swinging the
array through a wide arc, as is needed when engaging multiple missiles at
inside a kilometer range.

I\'m sorry ? I dont follow your maths. 100 gees is 1000 meters per second
accleration, or 1 km per second. 30 minutes is 1800 seconds to accelerate
in, so the missile\'s final velocity is 1800 kilometers per second. If it
slows down the acceleration, it will achieve more distance, but it will
still end up with the same velocity.

I\'m just concerned with the warhead(s) velocity while it is inside the
point defense\'s zone of operation, as that will define how long the defense
has to deal with many inbound rounds.

Mil blacking costs 1 megacredit per square meter. This will add up fast
when you are dealing with hundreds/thousands/whatever of ball bearings.

You also still have detection ranges out to long enough, assuming decent
sensitivity LIDARs.

But if the inbound missiles dont hit, then it\'s kind of pointless.

The second problem with this strategy is the length of sensor range given
TL10+  Traveller technology compared to weapons range. The analogy is far
more Age of Sail, where visibility is far greater than effective range than
1940s onward naval warfare, where if you can detect it, you can kill it
with air or missile strikes.

This opens up way too much of a can of worms IMO. The problem is when the
needle maneuvers, you have to reconfigure the sensor profile from each
point of observation.

One of the lo-tech SDB Thuddd\'s had a "sensor missile" - a missile with a
LIDAR, designed to provide sensor scans for the main ship. Assuming it\'s
sensor payload is equivalent in mass to most missile\'s warhead, it should
be able to flee as fast as they can chase it, and provide sensor readings
from a different point of observation to the parent ship until destroyed.

This makes things get real complex real fast.

Fair enough. I *like* kinetic kill missiles. I think they are an excellent
solution to the Imperial Rules of War banning civilians owning det nukes. I
just dont think they will be a solution to the problem that military ships
(fleets even more so) easily deal with huge missile swarms. Shooting up
other civilians, yes. Shooting up ethically challenged civilians,
certainly. Shooting up warships, no.

You sure you\'re not related to Leroy? Quoting conversations from a con...
Anyway, we\'re not talking about plasma guns; we\'re talking about missiles
vs lasers, and I maintain that in a Traveller context that requires long-range
lasers.

>The missile is coming straight at the ship not the PD battery unless the
>ship is *point* in space

Relative to the distances involved, the ship is a point. If the missile
is coming at the end of the ship - even an AHL - the PD battery is at
most 100-odd meters from the missile\'s impact point. If the missile
is 10,000km away, that\'s an angular offset of about two
arcsecond - a 1,800th of a degree. The perpendicular velocity of a 
1,000 km/s missile as seen by the PD battery is about 100 meters
per second. Since the laser pulse takes 1/30 of a second to get there
I can get the range wrong by up to 30% and still hit the missile.

>At the range you list above [10,000 km] the missile will have deployed its submunitons

It depends on how many hits you want and how fast the target evades,
but it\'s hard to get the deployment range out past 10,000km for 
reasonable parameters.

All right - how about this: if EW exists, why is it reasonable to 
assume that the (small) jammer on the missile can successfully jam
the (huge) sensor on the warship, why can\'t the warship mount a (big)
jammer that can successfully jam the (small) sensor on the missile?
For reasonable EW, it cuts both ways...

>The side armor will get exposed so what it will be proof against PD lasers
>fire.

Without you posting the design I can\'t evaluate that, but remember that
the Bubba brothers are expensive enough that the warship designer
can dedicate a Really Big defence laser to shooting them down and still
come out ahead.

>Now how big will that disk be? bigger than you example.
If you have one in every square meter of a disk the disk will be 
about 1100 m - 1.1 kilometers - in diameter. If the target evades
at 4 Gs, it takes it slightly more than five seconds to move itself 
outside that circle (0.5 * 4 G * 10 m/s2 * (5s)^2)=500 m
so you have to deploy the submunitions five 
seconds or less before impact, otherwise the target can get out of
the way. At 1000 km/s approach velocity that means you deploy at 
5000 km, inside the "can\'t miss" laser range. To push it out to 
30000 km - 30 seconds before impact - the error circle gets to
be 0.5*4*10*(30^2)=18,000 m in radius, an area of about a billion
square kilometers, or one BB per 1000 square meters - which is a
pretty wimpy density.

How can you possibly evaluate the effectiveness of a MCr 100s per shot
weapons system without imposing a price limit? I\'ll grant that 
these things can overwhelm a target in sufficient quantity - my main
point is that they\'re not very cost effective in doing so, given
how effective Traveller lasers are. There\'s probably an interesting
middle ground, of course - I think skipping the armour and going for
cheap and mass-produced missiles is more promising - but your giant
death missiles, like many other superweapons, aren\'t quite the ultimate
weapon.

Hey, I could even start organizing my own IPTS [Italian Peninsula
Traveller Support] group.

Anyway, the question is this: what would you consider a good theme for
an introductory Traveller adventure? Consider that being a convention
scenario I will have to plan for some constraints, i.e. it should be as
self-contained as possible. I think I\'ll use pre-generate characters
(which will help insure that everybody got the right mix of skills) in
order to save time, even if the Traveller chargen is one of the more
distinctive points of the game.

So, I\'d like some ideas from the list. Either a brief note on what
themes *you* would like to introduce in a "demo" scenario, or pointers
to published adventures which, in your opinion, would work well for
this. I don\'t own a large collection of Traveller Stuff, but a friend of
mine has a large collection of older and semi-obscure stuff from
Traveller\'s Glory Days, and he will have no problem in lending me some.

Before TNE there was no grav focus. Nilsen et al realised that you\'d need
HUGE mirrors to get small spots at the space combat ranges they had decided
on but instead of doing the sensible things of either making the hexes
smaller or postulating that x-ray lasers came earlier than TL 13 (X-ray
lasers at TL 13+ was part of Striker I) they invented the horrible grav
focus thingy and also gave it some real strange physics.

More power to Bruce for not allowing grav focus but I agree that it seems
TNE & T4 canon.

Could you fit two sets of fusion rockets to the ship and dump one set (*)
after acceleration, and use the second set for braking? Sort of like the
booster for a ramscoop to get to 1%C

(*) You would probably want to install a couple and drop them as each ran out.

Of course, then you have to harden the electronics.

This was one of the big problems in StarCruiser (okay so it\'s 2300 not Trav
but it brought in the det-lasers). Your lasers acting in PD could hit
missiles, but often you didn\'t do enough damage to kill them. They just got
a -tve modifier to hit.

The Darmine are briefly mentioned in Challenge 73 "Oasis in a New Era"
(pg 68 - 74) by Greg Videll. Irap is discussed there and in the
adventure "Undercity (pg 6-15).  Irap is _not_ the Darmine homeworld, it
is merely a Darmine world.  The article says:

	Irap (2630 Oasis) was once one of the most densely populated worlds of
the Old Imperium.  Its population grew to such proportions that in time,
the surface of the world became covered by a single, world spanning
arcology.  As can be expected, Irap suffered grievously at the hands of
the Virus.  Tens of millions [billions ?] died during the Collapse. 
Oddly enough, though, it was the Virus which saved the planet.  
	The Virus gave rise to an artificial intelligence, or Ai which saved
the Irappi in order to use them to conduct a war against other
manifestations of the Virus.  THe war was rumored to have lasted several
years into the time after the collapse 9refered to locally as Durlineal,
which means "Failing Light" in Kadli, the language of the Darmine....
The leader of Irap is referred to as "His Most Sublime Emata", a
hereditary title dating back several thousand years.	

Library Data

Darmine:Interfertile human subspecies are thought to have colonized much
of Zarushagar sector, including Irap (2630) before the founding of the
Old [Third] Imperium.  Certain facets of Darmine culture persist into
the present day, the most notable being the race\'s language, Kadli.3

These are, of course secondary sources.  The primary source for data on
the Darmine in MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia which states:

Darmine: Cultural region in the Zarushagar sector. Darmine had a
separate but submerged cultural identity within the First Imperium and
happily threw off that domination when the First Imperium fell. Allowed
to flourish by the Rule of Man, the community of worlds survived the
Long Night with little harm. 
     Darmine was the major focus of the llelish Pacification Campaign
(76 to 120). 

Some canonical source on the Darmine whose location I can not recall
also stated that Darmine did not have personal names ending in the
letter r.  Since I had already created a Darmine player charecter Trier
dehah Tarlineal before learning this I decided that Darmine did not
normally have names ending in the letter r as a sign of respect for the
prophet Telor.  This led me to realize that Darmine must not have very
many names and from this I developed the idea that Darmine names were
also the names of specific days of the Darmine year.  As depicted by me
Darmine society is matrilineal but patrilocal with no real gender
distinctions.

Unfortunately not.

	Non technical populations means sub populations that do not have access
to the higher TL resources such as central heating.  The Darmine people
are not very favorably disposed towards charitable giving as it is
contrary to the destiny of the poor to interfere with their poverty
[unless it is your destiny to give].  Therefore we do not have
socialized payment of heating bills.  Some subsects of Darmine thought
are anti technical, although they are in the minority.  Approximately 5%
of the total Darmine population belong to subsects that have beliefs
similar to those of the Terran Amish.  While few of the Darmine actually
freeze to death it is common for the cold nights to place some strain on
those who are young, old, or sick this strain may be the base cause of
deaths by other means.  Thus we Darmine say that the moons [the cold
caused at night] kill people.

	Darmine health care is fairly advanced however Darmine populations
often have odd reactions to drugs and this has delayed our deveelopment
of a pharmocological science.  The reaction of a Darmine individual to a
drug will not be similar to that of a non Darmine human and it may well
vary from time to time.

Our scientists believe that when the ancients altered our ancestors for
heavy metal tolerance so that they could live on our homeworld they did
so in a fairly crude [for the ultratech Ancients way].  As our
biochemistries continuously seek out foreign objects such as heavy
metals, especially copper, bond with them and remove them from our
bodies into our hair and fingernails [thereby causing our distinctive
and beautiful green or blue hair and nails], and bodily wastes this
process will interact with, and often eliminate any medicines.  This
does mean we are hard to poison but we are also hard to medicate.

	Interestingly enough this problem is much less prevelant in persons
with some non Darmine ancestory, even though most of our biological
adaptations seem to be dominant and we are interfertile with other human
races.  It is fairly easy for Darmine woman to bear the children of non
Darmine men however it is somewhat more difficult for Darmine men to
fertilize non Darmine women [although not for lack of effort....]

You have to remember, the design rules are aimed at median designs for
general-purpose use. Basically, standard, mass produced ships to do
conventional things. The design you are talking about does not fit into
those parameters.
If you are designing a specialty purpose ship, you should allow yourself
to customise various features. For example, there was one table in
Rolemaster (allright, one _useful_ table) that gave you the choice of
"tweaking" some of the standard equipment. The assumption was that
you got it specially made for yourself. You could have it be lighter or
stronger. The lighter you wanted it, the more it cost. All the way down
to 0-5% of the original mass for 500x the price. Similarly for stronger.
  What I suggest, is that you assume that for a specialty purpose craft
such as you are designing, that lower mass alternatives are available,
although a significantly higher costs. After all, modern spacecraft are
not made from the same materials we design our cars from!

As for slowing down, a couple of ideas spring to mind.

Gravity: although slingshotting is usually used by space probes to
accelerate, I think it is equally possible to use it to slow down as
well. With an appropriate course, the ship could sling around the
target sun, and maybe any orbiting jupiter sized masses, one or
more times to slow down. Sure, it make take a few years, but after
2000, who cares.
Alternatively, do the modern space probe thing. Fling yourself
past a few other stars on the way to set up your trajectory so
that you end up in orbit around the target star. Remember, you
don\'t have to shed all your velocity, just convert it from linear
velocity to orbital velocity.

Aerobraking: Using the atmosphere to slow down. Like in the 2010
film. No, I\'m not really serious about this one. Using atmosphere
to brake from 45% of c would be a bit silly. But it does lead on to:

Chronobraking: Same principle as Aerobraking, but instead dragging
against the stars Chromosphere, or more likely, its magnetic field.
Use some of those MW to generate a big magnetic field around
the ship that will repluse the star\'s field. Possibly in combination
with Gravity.

Light sail: Deploy this early on, they should be light. You don\'t get
a lot of thrust/braking, but if you are talking in a millenial timescale
then it might add up.

Ion drive: I don\'t have the stats. Might this add up over a very long
period? Use your fusion (or disposable rockets as someone
suggested) to acceleration, then dissassemble your fusion drive
as you go and use it as fuel for an ion drive. Hell, you\'ve got
years to decelerate...

\'S\' stands for \'small\' (I _think_ it is between 200 and 900 miles, but I
may be misremembering). \'B\' and \'C\' are offficially not possible, but
ought to stand for 11 and 12 (ie. 11,000 and 12,000 miles diameter). You
can make Galactic recognize them by messing with one of the files (I
forget what it\'s called; it\'s the one with all the various UPP definitions.
You\'ll know it when you see it. I think it is in the \'gen\' sub-directory).

Sorry, guys, but I don\'t think that would be quite right... here are the
problems, how do we fix \'em?

1. I don\'t have access to a scanner, only a single hard copy of an
irreplaceable magazine. Somebody close to me (Basingstoke, UK - voted the
second most boring town in England, but I assure you they haven\'t looked
inside *my* house) must have one we could use. Any offers?

2. We ought to get Thomas M. Price\'s permission - he is the author. We can
get around this one if Thomas agrees. Does anyone know where he is now?

3. Games Workshop own the copyright, as it was published in White Dwarf
about 20 years ago and copyright has not been reassigned to my knowledge.
In email discussion with me, GW have said it would be OK for me to post my
articles on the Web so long as they retain the copyright, and each such
article is clearly marked (c) Games Workshop 19xx to protect that
copyright. I did not discuss other people\'s articles, nor posting to a
mailing list. GW are doing us a favour by taking the above position, and I
don\'t want to abuse this trust by extending beyond what was discussed. Nor
do I want to open such a discussion on behalf of another author, especially
without his permission.

I think Bryan Borich intended to talk to GW about the IISS Ship Files and
other items, and he may have more up to date info on a wider picture - what
say, Bryan? Anyone?

I used to own the entire series, and after a couple re-reads, began to
find Earl Dumarest\'s "infinite street wisdom" a bit pendantic.  It began
to get on my nerves.  So I sold the books.  Now I\'m wishing I hadn\'t.

The problem is an incomplete analysis.
Sure the magnet pulls you forward after it lands, but according to old
Issac, the momentum that you gave it to throw it ahead of you pushes you
backwards.
If you end up attached to the magnet, then conservation of momentum suggests
that you will be back where you started and at the same velocity.
If you do the experiment on Earth and get a different result, then I am
confident that the difference is caused by friction.
Of course, it would be better if you throw the magnet behind you far enough
that you aren\'t pulled back to it, but then, that\'s just a normal reaction
drive.

Just because you are using pre-generated characters doesn\'t mean you have to
skip a demo of the process.  You could start with a brief description of the
process and then take the simplest character in your batch (maybe an NPC)
and go through the generation process using a list of "pre-rolled" numbers.

Show them the list and tell them you were going to use the numbers on it
rather than rolling them to save time.  Then each time you use one you draw
a line through it.  When you get done, you have several left over, but
that\'s OK, because you are done with the character.

When you are done with the process, you show them the character that you
generated from it using those numbers earlier.  You don\'t even have to show
them the entire process, just enough for them to understand how it works.

One last tip, always ask for questions.  If you can answer them briefly, do
so.   If the answer will take some time, tell the questioner that the answer
is rather involved, long, ect. and ask to get together after, or get a name
and phone number or address (this is also an excellent way to make new
friends).  If you don\'t know the answer, you can say something like, "I
don\'t know, but, I know how to find out."  Then get their name and phone
number or address.  I\'ll bet that with the combined knowledge and contacts
represented on the TML, we could answer any question that could be asked by
any outsider (i.e. non-Traveller).

suggestions

Don\'t use the passenger type low berths. I would stringly suggest using the
frozen watch protocols ie lots of preparation time to the low berth in
exchange for easy and rapid "defrosting".
Especially since someone will be the first to be revived and is relying on a
2000 year old robot to do the job :)

I think that you should be allowed to ignore the usual "emergency
evacuation in 90 seconds"
requirement (ie 500 airlocak) - a couple of airlocks for maintenance should
suffice :)

Forget the radar and the tracker, any proper spaceships out there should
avoid you.
The real question is
	"what are you going to do about something you spot?"

assume that the closing velocity is 10,000km/s (ie about twice yours)

s = escape distance (ie how far you can move sideways before collision)
a = acceleration (0.6g = 6m/s^2)
t = acceleration time (assume 1 second - you need some fuel left :)
d = detection distance (50mkm)
v = closing velocity (10,000km/s ie about twice yours)

s = at(t/2 + (d/v - t)
  = 30 km (more than enough)

so you can probably get away with a smaller passive scanner and save power.

The suggestion of booster rockets to start with has already been made, as
has using
a metal hull.
Also consider dumping all the spent radioactives before decelerating -
as long as they are going to miss the planet there should be no problem
(in fact you probably wouldn\'t want them on the ship anyway).

I do have a technology qestion:
Are there artificial wombs by TL9?
Also 40 std of embryos means lots of std of babycare products :)
Otherwise you\'re going to have to ship living animals, at which point
the embryos give genetic diversity but not much else.

If you are in space and you throw the magnet ahead of you, you will
start moving backwards at first.  Eventually, you and the magnet will be
pulled back together and will end up exactly where you started.  This
is called conservation of momentum.

Currently, you can generate a magnetic field around a magnetic object
which will pull you forward.  Unfortunately every method of doing so
will generate equal, but opposte forces which push you back.  Since
we don\'t know how to generate gravity wells that aren\'t attached to
a mass it\'s hard to say how it would work, but whatever it did
would violate conservation of momentum and would most likely have

Funny, I\'d look at it the other way. We know that CT/MT lasers were
effective at several light seconds. We know that said lasers fit
into little CT turrets (so they weren\'t meters accross). So I\'d have
to say that they *had* to be grav-focused, or some other (less
plausable?) explanation for making a 4m mirror fit in a 1 ton turret.

Any better ideas for how you get effective several light second
ranged lasers into a little turret?

Bussard Ramjet.  While accelerating to ram speed (3000 km/s), fuel can be
provided by tankers which could match velocity with the mother ship and dock
then pump fuel into her tanks.  Once you reach ram speed, fuel is free.
Half way to your destination, you turn around and begin deceleration, using
your ram drive on the free fuel available.  Once you reach your destination
the tankers will do their job again.

Even if you have to reduce the acceleration to .1 G, you will still save
much time in transit.  Using the formulas posted earlier, I find that the
time up to ram speed would be less than 35 days.  It would cover a distance
of 60 AU and use a total of 1,500,000 Td of fuel (based on a loaded weight
of 900 kt which I know is more than your "Mass (Loaded/Clean):
827,423t/543,423t", but gives us a working figure).

By the way, your tanks and tankers would be full on arrival and any cargo
areas holding cargo that would not be damaged by cryogenic liquids could be
used as auxiliary fuel tanks.

If you are including modular cutters in her compliment. This represents
50,000 loads or one load arriving every 60 seconds.  This is doable, but I
would probably go with a larger tanker.

Version 1.9 of my FF&S2 starship design spreadsheet for Excel is now freely
available on my web site. The site address is:
www.ames.net/igor/trav/trav.htm. Once you get there, simply go to the
Drydock page.

Fixes/Changes/Additions in this version include:
* Fixed volume and area calculations for asteroid hulls.
* Fixed some fuel mass problems (such as LH2 weighing 1.07 instead of .07,
ack)
* Fixed the crew totals in the summary bar.
* Fixed some primitive thrust agencies problems.
* Fixed many broken items pertaining to low tech level (9-10) craft.
* Changed the primitive thrust agencies to use the more realistic logrithmic
mass function for calculating fuel endurance in g-hours.
* Changed the HEPlaR thrust agency to use the more realistic logrithmic mass
function for calculating fuel endurance in g-hours.
* Added the optional ability to store fuel in the waste space caused by
streamlining.

The most important change is the fact that fuel-based sublight drives
(primitive drives and HEPlaR) are now using the logrithmic mass-based
function for fuel endurance. One side affect of this is that you no longer
specify how many g-hours of fuel you want - that is next to impossible to
reliably calculate because the formula is circular (it depends on mass - add
more fuel, you add more mass...). So now you specify how many displacement
tons (std, 14m3) of fuel you want the system to carry - and it calculates
the G-hour endurance. Not as simple, perhaps, but more realistic and even
beneficial (especially for low-tech rockets with heavy fuels).

Another note: Many Excel 5.0 users have reported a variety of error messages
and #VALUE results. I have no answer for this. I\'m working on this
spreadsheet in Excel 97, but I specifically save it in the Excel 5.0/7.0
format. I am not using any advanced functions that aren\'t supported in Excel
5, to the best of my knowledge. So unless someone can tell me otherwise, I
have to assume the problem is with Excel 97s export filter, and theres not
much I can do about it.

For the record, heres a short list of the functions I\'m using:
CONCATENATE(), CHOOSE(), VLOOKUP(), IF(), AND(), OR(), ISERR(), FIXED(),
ROUND(),SQRT(). All of these should work in excel 5.

I\'m sorry for any problems people have been having.

	The problem is that anything can be within the comments section.
	e.g. my Rure has something like :

	E=Tech level as usual

	But as its probately more important to know that your system is

	befor the 3I contacts them, they have to cross the Lancian region.
	The Suerrat expansion, become a problem later during the antebellum.

	Here is an exerpt from David Burdens writeup - for further reference
	look at his homepage, or ask me for email.

	BTW: M1 should be pacification campain for joy of the "gun geeks" ;-)

	----

	The Region covers 5 subsectors and is centered on Subsector D
	( Tansa ) of Gushemege Sector. Three subsectors lie in Gushemege
	( Taapvaia, Tansa, Isi Ahto ), and one each in Corridor ( Sashrakusha )
	and Dagudashaag ( Mimu ).

	Pure blooded racial Lancians, who originated on Kukhun in Tansa
	Subsector, average 1.9m in height and mass about 70 kg. They are
	thinner and taller than most Solomani, usually with fair skins
	and light brown or straw hair.  Due to dietary incompatibilities
	with Kukhunen fauna the original Kukhunen were vegetarian, and
	this is still a characteristic of most Lancian societies.  To
	all intents and purposes the average Lancian is nowadays
	indistinguishable from the mass of starfaring humaniti. The fact
	that being "Lancian" is more a way of living than an accident of
	biology is often not fully appreciated by sentients from beyond
	the bounds of the Region.

	Kukhun ( 3105 B658997-E ) was seeded by the Ancients with human
	stock around 300,000 years ago. By the time that the Vilani
	Naasirka bureau made first contact around -9100 they had reached
	TL4. The Kukhunen were a creative culture, but with a taste for
	violence and a mind of their own that did not take too kindly to
	the rigidity of Vilani rule. In concert with the neighbouring
	S\'mrii they were continually champing at the bit of Vilani rule.

	At War: Problems began in -24 when the Lancian Confederation was
	approached by the Sylean Federation to join their federation of
	the stars. Efforts to bring the Confederation into line were
	increased from 36 onwards as the Third Imperium began to flex
	its muscles. The Lancians, with bad memories of the First and
	Second Imperiums, and now with a culture that was fundamentally
	different from that espoused by Emperor Cleon I, were none to
	keen to surrender their independence. A cold war soon gave way
	to a widespread campaign of terrorism and destabilisation. By 57
	open war had broken out on several worlds as Artemsus sent
	Imperial aid to guerillas fighting Lancian governments. By 73
	most other worlds in Gushemege had joined the Imperium; even
	sever all non-Lancian dominated worlds from the Confederation
	had signed up.  In 74 non-Lancians on the strategic world of
	Shiramuunir ( 2507 C444AC8-F ) revolted in defiance of the
	Lancian government, calling for Imperium help to free them from
	Lancian "tyranny".

	Artemsus finally lost patience and sent in the Fleet, as much to
	stop the expansion of Lancian philosophy, which had been gaining
	ground, as to bring Lancia into the Imperium. Artemsus\' great
	mistake was to put the Duke of Vland in charge of the Campaign.
	The Vilani Pacification Campaign was as long and bloody as it
	was since the Lancians and S\'mrii saw it as a replay of the
	Consolidation Wars of 5000 years previously.  In the end the
	Imperium, in the form of Vland\'s Makhidkarun Bureau, prevailed
	and in 120 the Lancian worlds joined the Third Imperium, but
	under sufferance.

	If you place a transponder on the missile sending its course to
	the intercepting firecontrol, it should be possible to show naval
	stupidity^h^h^h^h^h^h^h^hintelligence, that KKMs are imposible.

	imposible to spot. If you add decoys or a white out, the task
	for obtaining a sensor lock is beyond imposible. So the TNE joke
	that dampers only work in Jo\'s Garage. A PD laser can probately
	hit and destroy several missiles, but it need a fire control lock
	to do so, and as missiles have at least a 4/3/4/3/1 signature, the
	to lock is imposible and to hit difficult in best conditions.

	A KKM deploying 6 submissiles, 6 decoys and a white out at 30kkm
	is a slippy target ;-) Imho space combat and especialy missiles
	should be considered broken in T4. A KKM would make 1d6 single

Again, in the book "The Gamester Wars", in the third of the set, the 
antagonist gains access to the Ancients\' (the Travellers) missiles.  
These are high tech nukes.  They are homing types, but they have 
enhanced masking capability, similar in effect to a black globe.  They 
appear only long enough to lock on a target, then disappear for some 
seconds, only to appear again to update its\' lock.  Makes it near 
impossible in the book to destroy them (but then, the victim is in a 
ship without a capable PD system.

Wonder if that could be a TL advance that the "General Dynamics", LSPs, 
Sternmetals of the Imperium would be working on to bring the missile 
back into vogue....

In the "real" (ie Traveller) world, a 100MCr ship with no point defence
weapons moving on a fairly predictable course with a very high closing
velocity
that has to get within 30,000km to fire ought to be the dream target of all
time
for a cheap kinetic kill missile.

I can\'t be bothered to do the sums, but I would expect that a sub-1MCr
anti-missile-missile can be built that guarantees a kill at a safe distance.

The real problem is that if you spend enough on a missile, it just becomes
a ship with no crew. So your fleet just uses its anti-fighter defences.

The only navies that have problems are those that have done the sums,
decided that it doesn\'t work and saved money by not providing a defence.
Individual ships that aren\'t multi-role have the same problems, but then
they shouldn\'t be let out on their own.

Its just like the PAW armed rocks vs Meson gun armed dispersed structure
arguments. If both sides have the same attack/defence conclusions its
a slogging match. If they disagree, its carnage :)

Why not just add fuel scoops and an auto processing plant. Surely for

There are advantages to making the warhead/payload fairly dense for

Cool!  This actually sounds like a single interstellar culture made up of
several human "minor races" ("interfertile human subspecies are ....").
This could be fun as another counter-example to the Imperial "major/minor
race" propaganda.  You\'ve got a collection of people originating from a
number of worlds that speak a common language and consider themselves to
have a common culture.

It also sounds like the Darmine region might be one of the areas that got
jump tech as it leaked out of pre-First Imperium Vilani space.  That would
give them a chance to colonize a chunk of Zarushagar before the Vilani
Consolidation Wars sucked them into the Vilani Ziru Sirka; there must be
a millenium or two window of opportunity for that.  Since the Loeskalth
of Gushemege didn\'t get crushed until the Consolidation Wars, this seems
plausible.

This sounds like an interesting area to develop for a late-period Milieu
Zero campaign.

Has anybody figured how these RAM jets would actually work? They\'re a
staple in SF but they generally say something like "a huge magnetic field
works like a gigantic hose to suck in the free hydrogen for thousands of km
around the ship". P Andersson in The boat of a million years (great book
btw) said that the drive dissociated hydrogen molecules with lasers to make
them react to the supercunducting magnetic net. Bussard RAM jets seem
awfully hightech for TL 9 (or even TL 15).

Gravity braking is for slow moving things such as our spaceprobes, its

This might work but you need to brake before you\'re close to the star (and
there aren\'t any stars inbetween you and the target.

If the target has a huge laser shooting photons at you but otherwise not
that useful.

An ion drive cannot possibly beat a fusion drive as an ion drive take its
power from someplace else while the fusion drive keeps its power in the
fuel. There isn\'t all that much light from stars in deep space to drive the
ion engine.

X-rays are pretty small compared to visible light, especially hard x-rays
and if that isn\'t enough we could wiggle atoms with gravitics to produce
gamma lasers with even shorter wavelengths. Shooting x-rays with free
electron lasers today isn\'t a physics problem but an engineering problem.

   It\'s 998m/sec _per second_, a rate change as you call it - not an
actual squared quantity. (Man, this takes me back to basic physics and
flight school)

   At 1g, we would gain 9.98 m/sec of velocity for every second we
accelerate, thus after 2 seconds our velocity would be 19.96 m/sec, after
1800 secs (30 min) our velocity would be 17,964 m/sec (17.964 km/sec).
Follow?

   At 100g, we gain 998m/sec for every second we accelerate, after 10
seconds we gain 9980 m/sec. After 100 sec, we gain 99,800 m/sec. After
1000 sec, we gain 998,000m/sec. After 1800sec, we gain 1,796,400 m/sec.

This ship is travelling at some 1/1000 c so each LY should take some
thousands of years. There are no nearby gasgiants, planets, bars etc with
matching velocities on this cruise. Traveller might be fantasy but it\'s not

This isn\'t my idea, it\'s from a book by Robert Forward...

If you can get your home world to aim a huge laser at you you can use
a lightsail to accelerate and then detach part of the light sail (the
outer ring), turn your ship around with the middle part of the light
sail, and then use the outer ring to reflect the laser back at your
ship, thus slowing it down.  You won\'t get as much thrust slowing down
and you\'ll eventually lose the outer ring, but it would help.  I
haven\'t done any numbers on this, though...

It\'s possible to build at tech-9 using FFS1.  I spent some time building
one.  Target speed is something like 0.25 c, which is achievable for a 
very large ship using the astoundingly efficient fusion rockets that are
available at tech-9.  Most of the ship is fuel, and you need to use the
relativistic rocket equation and ship\'s mass to get reasonable figures
at those extremes of speed and acceleration.  You need to use a *small*
fusion rocket to save mass -- low acceleration, but for a long time.  
FFS1 really isn\'t designed to be too helpful with STL starship design.

Phil Kitching <PhilK@btinternet.com> suggested:

Or in the case of ESA Longrange, a member of the generation ship part of
the crew.  C-Jammer had something like a hundred thousand colonists in 
cold sleep and a thousand crew awake (with room to expand to 10x that by
the end of the mission).  The ship\'s going to be quite large, since LHyd
is so light and the required mass fraction is so high.

I\'ll have to drag out my notes and see if anything\'s postable from them.
As I recall, I got far enough with the design to show it\'s technically
feasible, but expensive enough that the ESA can\'t afford much more than
the Longrange ships.

You pull on the string, the string pulls on the cork, and the cork gets
pulled through the water.  It tries to go towards you with the same force
that you try to go towards it.  Depending on your friction against the
water, the force on you results in some acceleration, as does the force on
the cork.  For example, if the cork floats, then it can push against the
water, and let you haul yourself around by it, but that depends on there
being some water to push against.

In other words, exactly what happens depends on some real world properties,
like friction, that differ dramatically once you hit space.

If you are in a wagon, and you throw a magnet ahead of you, you are pushed
backwards to the same extent the magnet is pushed forward.  If you are on
the ground, though, you can put a brake on the wheels when the magnet is
flying through the air, and then unlock the wheels once the magnet hits the
ground.

The friction of the ground against the magnet might mean that you move and
the magnet does not, but there again, the reason it works is that you have
a stable thing to push against.

In space, if you throw a magnet forward, you will go back, but there is no
friction and no ground to "brake" against.  The magnet will pull you both
back to the place you started, assuming it is strong enough to overcome the
initial throw.  In any event, the only way to move through space is to
throw something in the opposite direction, if you do not want free energy
machines.

For a good explanation of how momentum conservation makes things like this
difficult, consult a good college physics textbook, like Halliday and
Resnick.  They go into incredible detail, and give you the terms needed to
see why people are arguing the way they are.

They also give you the tools needed to se what else results if you break a
law of physics.  For example, if you create "space brakes" or "momentum
sinks" that let you accelerate to a higher velocity than the amount of
energy you spent says you should, then you have all sorts of interesting
results.  An example - assume "jumpspace thruster" that converts matter to
some jumpspace stuff that gives you the maximum delta v for a given amount
of exhaust.  Any such device becomes a near perfect power plant, if you are
not careful.

Given all the megacorps and the imperial navy, think of the R&D efforts

the messages from so many on the list shows a wide spectrum of areas in 
which research is currently being done...  Now bounce that forward a

No, x-ray/gamma ray lasers are cool by me. At least you can build
those in FFS (1&2) :-)

True enough.

it may have gone astray in the power outage. Here goes again.


I have been using a revised hex numbering system for my campaign which
may be of interest.

It is based on the unknown space navigation table as shown in
Traveller Alien Module 4, Zhodani on page 48 and I know it was presented
in at least one other Traveller  publications in the past.

It groups a 7 across hex of hexes into 6 equal triangular like areas to
be used by the referee to plot star positions as the pcs journey
through unknown space.

Taking the concept a little further, I reasoned that if the center hex
was labeled      0,0,0        I should be able to go as far as I wanted
in any direction and know how far it was from that point of origin. I
labeled the a first number set as the sextant, a second number set as
the band (distance away from 0,0,0), and the third number as the
deviation to starboard within the sextant.
To demonstrate:
Start point is 0,0,0 meaning the center.
Band one is composed of 1,1,0 meaning sector 1 (Coreward), band 1, 0
deviation,  2,1,0 meaning sector 2 (Coreward Trailing), band 1, 0
deviation,  3,1,0 meaning sector 3 (Rimward, Trailing), band 1, 0
deviation,  4,1,0 meaning sector 4 (Rimward), etc., etc., 5,1,0 meaning
sector 5 (Rimward Spinward), etc., etc., and 6,1,0 meaning sector 6
Coreward Spinward), etc., etc.
Band two is made up of  1,2,0 and 1,2,1/2,2,0 and 2,2,1/3,2,0 and 3,2,1 
4,2,0 and 4,2,1/5,2,0 and 5,2,1/6,2,0 and 6,2,1
Band three is 1,3,0 - 1,3,1 and 1,3,2/ 2,3,0 - 2,3,1 and 2,3,2 etc. etc.

Now lets say we use Capital (2118) Core (Old Atlas) as the center of our
universe. It becomes 0,0,0. 
Nimluin (2209) Core becomes 1,9,1, Ispumer (2615) Core becomes 2,5,0,
Gurishi (3022) Core becomes 3,9,0, Skeen (2226) Core becomes 3,9,8 etc.

If a navigator was at Nimluin, Gurishi or Skeen, he would know that he
had travelled a total distance of 9 parsecs away from Core (5 in the
case of Ispumer) and had made a 1, 0 or 8 respectively parsec starboard
deviation from the norm.

Continuing out a long way, Terra (1827) Sol becomes 4,131,3, Regina
(1910) Spinward Marches becomes 5,130,128. Terra is 131 parsecs from
Capital at a 3 parsec starboard deviation ( (3/130x 60)+(3x60) or
181.385 degrees).  Regina is 130 parsecs from capital at a 128 parsec
starboard deviation (128/130x 60)+(4x60) or 299.076 degrees).
Notice that the deviation number can only total to 1 less than the band
number, the (((sextant number -1) times 60) plus the ((deviation number
divided by band number ) times 60)) will give the degree angle direction
from center, and  the deviation parsec is always at an angle of  the
((band number times 60) + 120) degrees.
I realize the numbering system is a little more cumbersome than our
present system but it appears to relay more usable information without
remembering the location of 560 sub-sectors within 35 sectors, or more
if you go outside *known* space. 

Using the s,bbb,ddd number combination we could expand our borders out
to 997,000+ parsecs in any of 6 directions. It could also be applied to
those referees using 3D space adding a fourth number set indicating
plus/minus for up/down direction.

Any thoughts?

Your welcome. Glad to do it. Traveller is my favorite RPG (and has been
since \'80) so its my pleasure to put my skills (I\'m a programmer by
profession) to work. Plenty of people on this list have helped me out in one
way or another, so I\'m returning the favor.

For the record, future works of mine will include a Java based Traveller
program suite (word generation finished, planet/system generation well
underway), and more FF&S2 worksheets (for weapons, vehicles, etc...) for
those of us who can\'t get the fine programs available on the Macs to work on
our Windows machines.

Feel free to keep heaping praise upon me, of course :) - but also please let
me know what you don\'t like, what you want changed, and what new stuff you\'d
like to see. If I have the knowledge and skill (And time) to do it, I\'d be
happy to.

Thanks for your support guys - it makes it all worthwhile to do it.

According to the rules, you can receive a credit on your ship\'s hull by
painting it a single color rather than the chameleon coat - and you get even
a bigger credit if you put no paint on it at all. The problem is, with real
cheap hulls (like a small freighter), this credit can be larger than the
cost of the hull itself! That is, your hull is free!

This, of course, is wrong. What would be a better way of handling this? I
think that a percentage based system would be better - single color hulls
are 90% the cost of regular, plain hulls are 80%, etc... What do you think
of that? And what should the percentages be (I offered the above only as

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  There has been some discussion about the "analogy" of throwing a magnet
ahead to represent the idea of a gravity well being generated in front of a
ship and pulling a ship forward...

  I would like to propose an alternate "analogy" to represent the concept
of the gravity well...

  Suppose the generation of the gravity well were the equivalent of a
"grappling hook" thrown by the ship and attached to a rope?  The hook is
thrown ahead (so to speak) with the tines of the hook grabbing the fabric
of space.  Yes, there is some "efficiency loss with the forward motion of
the hook being thrown forward, but the energy used to "winch" the ship
forward is greater than the energy used to project the hook forward for a
net gain.  Consequently - in order to "violate" the known physics, the
method must create a new physics to work off of (the idea of hooking into
the fabric of space and then winching).

  To continue the analogy: suppose you have a wagon on a slope.  Until
recently (ie before the invention of the grappling hook and winch) one
needed a horse to pull that wagon up the slope.  You need to feed the horse
hay in order to get it to move a set distance.  Now, you need to carry hay
on that wagon to feed to the horse to get it to go up the slope.  However,
some dude invents a gun, a grapple, and a hand cranked motor.  He mounts
the gun on the wagon, fires the grapple ahead, and then - winches the wagon
up.  The natives then say "hey!  That works!  It violates the principle of
using horsepower, but it works!"

  Thing is, until the guy invented the grapple and rope - the natives
didn\'t have any "theory" that could circumvent the necessity of using a horse.

  It is possible that the reactionless aspect of the Grav Thrusters in
Traveller have managed to become the equal of the grappling hook/rope/winch
concept in normal physics.  It only works because...

  The other end of the "rope" is attached to the wagon!

  Granted, this "analogy" is inelegant, but by definition, science is the
process of learning what is and is not capable.  Until someone proved it
otherwise - it was accepted that the universe revolves around the earth.
Until proven otherwise, it was accepted that you could not break the sound
barrier.  Until Calculus was developed, certain math could not be done to
explain how things work.  To tie this in with reality and gaming systems -
recently, a whole new branch of math had to be developed in order to win a
prize proving a math formula works.  It was so complex that people are
certain it\'s not the method used by some 1700\'s or 1800\'s amateur
mathematician.  I don\'t think that science is done with finding new ways to
look at the universe.
  In all fairness, I too don\'t believe in the reactionless concept being
viable - but again, that is based upon what I was taught.  I was also
taught however, that before something can be proved or disproved, it must
be concieved of... and reactionless drives have been concieved of <grin>.

  Hope this "analogy" helps for some...

Actually, there is one further thing that was left out...

There is the energy required to throw the magnet ahead...
but there is also the energy used to pull the rope in.  If the rope can
anchor on some point due to some property at the end of the rope, then the
energy used to pull inthe rope is added to net effect.  Thus the equation
would look like this:

work = enery used to throw device forward - equal and opposite energy to
throw the device forward (net effect zero as they cancel out) plus the
energy used to pull the object forward...

  The problem as I see it on a logic basis is getting the <censored> magnet
to hold with enough strength to allow the internal energy to work on the
external environment...

*sigh*  Forever in my brother\'s shadow.  IIRC, I was the one who first
proposed the Templars, and Craig took the ball, painted it lime green and
ran with it.  We had a lot of fun with various bits of the illuminated
history of Traveller.  (BTW:  It\'s "Berry")

As a quick recap, Sometime around 850AD, a Hiver expedition was exploring
an abandoned Ancient base in Arabia\'s Empty Quarter.  A lone human wandered
by, and was captured.  Unknown to the Hivers, this man was a powerful
latent psi.  He was exposed to a sort of telepathic log book, which
downloaded itself into his brain.  The man went on to write the
Necronomicon and teach his skills to a few others.  Since the database had
given him pictures of horrible monsters (Grandfather and his Droyne
servants, as well as a handle on the vastness of space, he was quite insane
and paranoid.

The Hivers blew the site and left.  (Arguments about if this was a
deliberate manipulation or an accident continue)  One of the items missed
was a bronze head.. a teaching tool for the humanoids used by the Ancients.
 It was found by the Knights Templar, and returned to Europe, where it woke
up.

The Bronze Head had one over-riding directive: return home for repair.
Alas, the Head had lost all but the most indication on where home was.
When the Templars were destroyed in 1315, Jaque deMolay (a powerful
telepath and teleport) took the head into hiding.

The Templars continued in secret, always with the twin goals of defending
humanity from the return of the Elder Ones, and bringing about space flight.

When the Vilani were contacted, the Templars were convinced that these were
the Elder Ones, and subtly arranged the First Interstellar War.  They also
brought about the fall of the Rule of Man.  (There were Templars on both
sides of the infamous money issue in -1776)

Templar operations were greatly enhanced by the discover of "The Net."  The
Net is a telepathic phenomena, a method for instant communication over
interstellar distances.  Alas, only one in a thousand can even reach the
net, and those who do either die or become quite crazed.

In Milieu:0, the Templars are behind Cleon\'s rise to the throne, and are
encouraging expansion to Spinward.

In the Classic Era, they are carefully working behind the scenes to allow
them access to Five Sister\'s Subsector and it\'s treasure, the homeworld of
the Ancients!

The Makimir grav raft is intended as a small family or corporate grav raft
for errands and simple travelling. The design is unremarkable but reliable.
One interesting feature of the design is the use of batteries as a power
source instead of newer technologies such as Fusion+. Since this is intended
to be a conservative design, batteries were choosen over the new Fusion+
technology. Also, this design may be safely exported to non-Imperium markets
without fear of Imperial sanctions.

The design seats four adults in two rows of two. The craft is equiped with
simple electronics that allow the computer to fly the raft itself in the
presence of a computerized trafic system, or detailed flight plans. The
craft is completely pressurized and can reach orbit if neccessary.

The two rear passenger seat can be removed, increasing the cargo area to
nearly 14 cubic meters. The rear section roof can be removed as well,
allowing for irregularly sized cargos to be placed within (although the
craft is no longer presurized.

While there are no models of the Makimir designed for military use (there
are no weapon mounting points on the craft), there have been rumors of some
recon units using modified Makimirs for stealth covert unit insertion
missions (as the Makimir with its sensors off is a zero-emission craft).

=================================================
My question is:
  Is the sensitivity 7 AEMS too powerful? Not powerful enough? I envision
this as a simple collision avoidance and navigational radar...

   Excellent suggestions for handling the problem.  I do have one question
though, why in the hell would anyone allow a starship out of the
construction dock without any paint?  The benefits of painting a hull seem
so obvious to me that I can\'t even imagine why you wouldn\'t.

In point of fact, the problem at the time was that as observations got
better, the fiddling needed got more extreme.  Epicycles were not a
terrible approach, as long as they were trying to model something circular
with variation, but modelling ellipses became unreasonable.

Those in the field knew that it was possible, as they had supersonic

Of course not, but new ways have to explain old data.  For example, a space
time hook leads to some interesting problems in relativity, as it creates a
preferred frame.  There may be such, but any such preferred frame had best
not invalidate the current GR experiments, or you do get things like
conservation of momentum and energy going out the window.  The last time
this happened, we got radioactive decay, so it is certainly possible

Imagine the faces of the nineteenth century gamers when being told that
there is no permanence, and that the fundamental building blocks of matter
decay.  Now imagine the DM when a player proudly announces that he is going
to build a huge "Decay bomb" that will kill people inside buildings!

That we can do this now is not the point.  That old DM has to deal with the
fact that his 19th century warfare concept has just been thrashed.
Likewise, a DM now who accepts a reactionless drive has to deal with the
free energy machine he or she created.  The truth might be that these do
exist and that they are free energy machines, but this is hard to explain,
and makes the world hard to understand.

The better you do at explaining it, and making the world comprehensible,
the better your game.  Often, not breaking the laws of physics is a good
way to help in the process, but sometimes, you just have to.

FWIW, I am not sure whether I like the space winch, the jump space rocket,
or the inertialess drive better as a handwave.  I may go back to fusion
rockets and antigrav.

Uhhh...not many gas giants in interstellar space. not much of _anything_
in interstellar space.

One convenient way of doing it would be to stick, essentially, a gigantic
iceberg on one end of your hull. This serves two purposes:

1)It makes a handy radioactivity and micrometeor shield.
2)It\'s a great source of fuel for your deceleration burn.

I think the only way to do this successfully is to use a bussard ramscoop
coupled to either a fusion or ion drive. With an ion drive you get to use
excess hull (if you use a large enough asteroid hull) as fuel, as well as
that big berg on your front end. Ion drives are really simple, and
reliable, though they\'re low gee drives. What you do is use boosters to
get to ramscoop speed in your home system, then just decelerate for a
_long_ time. 

Poul Anderson wrote a book about a sublight starship, but the name escapes
me right now.

Mostly it dealt with a ship that got to a very high percentage of C, so
most of the plot revolved around time dilation effects, and it wasn\'t a
\'generation\' ship in that sense of the word.

Connecting to a previous discussion, perhaps the man just got himself a

well, your description is pretty much as good as any, but I disagree with
your assertion that they\'re high tech. Creating and shaping a magnetic
field is pretty easy with superconductors, which are TL-9 technology.
Using lasers or masers to ionize gases are TL-7 technology...a neon sign
is a heck of a lot closer to a laser than anyone ever realized.

So you create a huge ionizing field out in front of your ship. Once stray
atoms are ionized, again, it\'s childs play, relatively speaking, to
manipulate the ionized stream..._that_ is the same principle as a mass
spectrometer...invented at TL-6.

The trick seems to be is there enough material out there in interstellar
space to be able to do this?

I\'m not sure I understand your question...these are low acceleration
ships, even though they do reach a significant fraction of C, the entire
ship is moving in the same reference frame so it\'ll seem like the rest of
the universe has shrunk by 3% not them grown by 3%. All the ship has to
stand up to is the piddling little less than one gee drive produced by the
little engines used in these designs. 

Stress isn\'t placed upon anything by velocity, only acceleration.

I\'ve always been opposed to the draft, however, in this case...

Let\'s ask him first.  Then draft him if he won\'t do it voluntarily.  :-)

I can think of a couple.  Besides cost (1), you might want that nice shiny
hull to be visible (2).  Some boats and ships should be highly visible (like
life-boats).

I think that would be the correct way to go. As to the %\'s - if
chameleon is the base then the other %\'s seem too low. Why not use the
hull base cost with no paint, +.5% for all black up to +1% or more for
chameleon. Let the experts determine the cost factor.

  Asking for permission is definitely the right way to go.  But it may not be
absolutely necessary.  Uh . . .  I was going to make some long and complicated
copyright arguments about why they wouldn\'t win a case if they sued you, but
you\'re right in the end.  Keep \'em happy.  Ask nicely.  And let your forehead

I only recently learned of the existence and nature of said magazine, thanks
to Howard Stern.  Since I don\'t travel in such circles, it was never apparent
to me.  After learning of it, I figured what the hell, might improve my
reputation around the law school (perhaps with the lesbians who aren\'t half
bad looking, if no one else).  Thankfully, damn few at school know what my
email address is (it used to be MrRugbyman), and it will only be good for
another 3 months or so and the hassles involved in changing it aren\'t woth
the bother.  I have 4 other email accounts on different ISPs anyway, so no
harm, no foul.

I wasn\'t on the list but for last summer.  I did get a strange email after I
said "measure twice, cut once."  While its much more common than saying that
something is "on the square and level," turns out it the mail was simply from
a guy who thought I was an electrical engineer because other e.e.s he knew
used the phrase.  And foolish me, I thought measure twice, cut once was as
old as carpentry.

VARGR AND THEIR CLOTHING

The new Vargr stuff (when it eventually hits print) tries to emphasise the
range of ways that Vargr communicate, both consciously and unconsciously
(e.g. body language). Although it was pointed out that just wearing bright
clothes wouldn\'t mark you out in society, the Aliens book does emphasise the
manner in which insignia, jewelry and other adornments are extremely
important in providing a clear indication of one\'s social status, etc. A
high Charisma Vargr doesn\'t rely upon you being sufficiently wealthy to
*recognise* that he\'s wearing a \'designer label\' (as humans do). Rather, a
Vargr \'designer label\' might have the designer\'s name, sign, whatever,
embroidered on every available surface. If the Vargr were particularly
favoured, the signs would include something to the effect of "I made this
for (name of owner). (signature of Vargr designer)", etc. Don\'t get me wrong
- - Vargr visual communications can also be remarkably subtle.

I\'m game for it but don\'t have a website & consider it unlikely to get
paper publication (although I\'d love that).  While the Darmine are about
an order of magnitude less "contrary to traditional family values" than
the Sayat are, I think this is still about an order of magnitude too
high for publication most places.  It is also true that, to a certain
extent, I am just winging it.  For instance I did not know that the
prophet Telor happened to be female until 2-3 days ago.  Any suggestions
anyone ?

Actually I am planning on doing them up as a race for GURPS once Gurps
Traveller is released, or possibly sooner.  I think that the Darmine
have a number of what GURPS calls Advantages and Disadvantages that
regular Traveller, of any form, does not model well.

Here is the first draft of the brief version of the Darmine for GURPS

- -1 ST (-10)
+1 DX (+10)
+1 HT (+10)

Acute Hearing +1 (+2)
Attractive Appearance (+5)
Chauvanistic [not towards other human races] (-1)
Code of Honor - Darmine (too complicated to explain here (-5)
Compulsive Carousing
Congenial [not towards non humans] (-1)
Cool (+1)
Dependancy - a special diet high in heavy metals, common, monthly (-5)
[In a First Empire Campaign this would be uncommon, monthly (-10)]
Fit (+5)
Immunity to Poison - Only Metallic poisons (-50%) (+8)
Light Hangover (+2)
Major Delusion -  Numerology is destiny, everthing that happens in fours
is significant (-10)
Social Stigma Minority Group - Darmine (-10)
[In the First Empire Darmine were Outsiders (-15 points)
Unusual Biochemistry (-5)

This version of the Darmine does not include skills, but Carousing and
Theology are common

Total Cost +4 points :)

Common Advantages

Alchohol Tolerance
Alertness
Beautiful/Handsome Appearance
[with the +0% special effect Bishnonen Look (GURPS Mecha pg 33)]
Blesssed [with GM permission]
Charisma
Clerical Investment
Combat Reflexes
Destiny (good)
Greed
Imperturbable
Increased Wealth, Comfortable or Better
Luck
Oracle [with GM permission]
Pious
Sensative
Strong Will

Common Disadvantages

Bloddlust
Compulsive Spending (usually only at the -5 point level)
Curious
Destiny (bad)
Disciplines of Faith
Distractable
Extra Sleep
Gluttony
Intolerance [Non Humans]
Lecherous
[Note that many Darmine are not strictly heterosexual and may be tempted
by persons of either gender.  Darmine are not interested in sex with
nonhumans.]
Nosy
Odious Personal Habbit - constantly telling the others in the party that
things which happen in fours are significant until the other players
wish to wring your neck...
Overconfidence
Sense of Duty
Skinny
Sterile

Rare Disadvantages

Bully
Cowardice
Fat
Low Pain Threshold
Overweight
Sadism
Shyness
Vows of Monasticism, Chasity any of the "unfun" vows

> Whoops, make that the Darmine _underwear_ sourcebook.

I could not possible do the Darmine _underwear_ sourcebook because then
I would have to take time away from my busy store & office work merely
to look at gorgeous people modeling underwear;  naturally I would need
to be well paid for this hardship....

How does this aspect of the Templar Traveller fit in with Marc Millers
comment/sacred revelation to the list that the Ancient homeworld was
actually in the Regina Subsector ?

Is there something even better in the Five Sisters Subsector, like the
mystical center of the universe perhaps, or was Marc just publishing
disinformation to save us from information we are not meant to know....
[Maybe this is why T4.1 is running late, because Marc has to fit in
writing in between saving the universe.]

Nope, he got a good psychic impression of one of Grandfather\'s kiddies,

I noticed this when I was designing small craft like the light fighter
and the lifeboat I posted. I actually got so much credit for not
painting the lifeboat that the official cost was a -0.204MCr for it. The
credit not only exceeded the cost of the hull, it exceeded the cost of
the ship! I ended up just ignoring the credit for not painting it. BTW,
I violated the minimum size rule for thrusters for the lifeboat. I have
been working on a redesign of the lifeboat and will post the result when
I finish. I also have a version that does not use emergency low berths,
for those who would prefer not to risk using a low berth.

<lots of wagons, garppling hooks, fabric of space etc snipped>

Potential fields have NOTHING like a fabric of space that you can hook into
etc. Writers and science shows use the terms like "the curvature of space",
"fabric of space" etc like they were physical entities but they are not -
they are real world analogies to fields but most of the real world
counterparts abilities don\'t map back to the force field.

If you want a graspable analogy consider space being a rubber sheet and
that our 3D space is the 2D surface of it. If you put massive object on it
it will deform as the balls will sink in a bit, the amount dpendent on the
objects mass. The rubber mat is unbreakable by any means except by putting
extremely dense objects upon it (this part I do not agree with myself but
most physicist seem to believe that these singularities are for real). The
rubber mat is also lubricated by an infinitely good lubricant so you\'ll get
NO friction. Play with that for your ingenious devices but remember: You
cannot grab the rubber mat, glue to it or anything.If you come up with a
gizmo that does grab onto it etc then you aren\'t talking about gravity
anymore but handwave generated ether vortices produced by contemplating how
many pins can fit on the head of an angel or something.

Someone once described them as "a great idea for a brake". You
would want to look closely at the transfer of momentumn between
the interstellar hydrogen (at rest) and your ship. A huge hydrogen
dragnet like that is going to produce drag.
  Work out the fuel consumption rate. Multiply that by, say 8, since
your magnetic field will not be 100% efficient (ie only 12.5% of the
hydrogen it deflects will actually get to the drive) and factor that in
as a dampening effect against the thrust of your drive. The faster
you go, the larger the effect.
  Maybe it is insignificant. I don\'t know. But I suggest you run the
numbers.

Unless you got magnetic monopoles (and Boy is that old SF staple) it is
VERY hard to get high field strengths at thousands of kilometers, even with
superconductors. Whenever there is a high strength magnetic field it is
between things not outside things. I say bussard RAM jets are high tech and
I think that allowing them at TL 9 would spell big trouble for the
Traveller universe. If yoy can get VERY close to c speed then ramjets are
actually much better stardrives than J-drives from the crews perspective.
Traveller J-drives are unuseable to get to say the Andromeda galaxy but
bussards can do it in a lifetime (for the crew). Also note that a bussard
ramjet is the ULTIMATE kkm weapon if you have time to spare.

Read Poul Andersons "Tau zero" for a scientifically unfeasible but still
interesting story about a VERY long journey with such a ship.

That could be seen as overkill, as it is a 20,000 watt emitter..  Fly over
a schoolyard and sterilyze everyone.  For a simple traffic radar, hand wave
a 5km range radar into the craft.

I like this one best of all.  I don\'t need to grab anything or throw any
thing or use ropes or wagons or metal objects or magnets or anything.  I\'ll
set on your proposed rubber sheet and reach out my hand and press down on
it.  Since it is perfectly frictionless, I\'ll slide into the dimple I\'ve
made.  Then I pull my hand out from under me and press down again.  I\'ll
keep pressing down until I get to where I\'m going.  (In the audience, hands
clap as I wave the one that brought me here.)

I like this.  This is fun.  Can we do another?  ;-)

Features
1xSeat, Adequate for optional pilot
1xShip\'s locker (0.00std ea.)

This Lifeboat is designed with one emergency low berth with a capacity
for four
passengers or crew members. This lifeboat is intended to be launched
from a
jettison bay. There is a single seat for an optional pilot; however, a
pilot is
not necessary as the lifeboat\'s computer is a specialized computer that
will
pilot the boat and operate the radio to send a distress call.

It is designed to get away from the mother ship quickly with HEPlaR
engines.
The HEPlaR engines allow use in situations where there is no gravity,
such as
deep space. If the lifeboat is launched near a planet, a pilot could
land it on
the planet\'s surface using the Contra-grav lifters. In such a situation
the
emergency low berth could be left deactivated and the passengers simple
ride
to the surface in the cryogenic berths.

The fusion+ reactor is designed to be deactivated automatically, unless
a pilot
is present. The emergency low berth, radio, computers and life support
then
operate indefinitely using the solar cells.

This Lifeboat is designed for those who do not trust emergency low
berths.
It has a pilots workstation and seating for 6 passengers. There is a
food for
eight weeks and a fresher. The extended life support provides potable
water
through recycling after the initial supply runs out. When the lifeboat
is
activated it automatically requests a map of the solar system from the
ships
database.

This lifeboat is intended to be launched from a ship\'s jettison bay.
However,
it can also be used as an orbital shuttle. With seating for six
passengers
and contra-grav lifters to get from the planetary surface to orbit, at
2.75
dtons, it makes a very small, economical, passenger shuttle.

It is designed to get away from the mother ship quickly with the HEPlaR
engines. The pilot has over seven hours of fuel for the HEPlaR engines.
When
the HEPlaR engines are not in use or not needed the fusion+ reactor can
operate at reduced output, allowing it to run for 5 weeks in this mode.
If
both the HEPlaR engine and contra-grav lifters are shutdown the Tristam
S
can operate for 25 weeks with just the life support, computers, sensors
and
radio operating. Of course, the food would run out long before that. If
the
lifeboat is launched near a planet, the pilot can land it on the
planet\'s
surface using the contra-grav lifters.

The fully functional computer is provided with a full selection of games
and
vid packages to entertain the passengers and pilot while they are
waiting to
be rescued or for the food and water to run out.

I would tend to say that the visual clues on the designer may be _very_ subtle -
the designer\'s stamp may be olfactory (smell) instead.  It would also tend to
reinforce the \'status\' of a particular Vargr that he/she replaces high-cost
clothing before their personal scent overcomes that of the designer.

I think you must, from your question, but other than a few simplifications
I don\'t;

"tied into the ships computer" I would interpret as "tied into the ship\'s
systems".  It would use the ship\' sensors and helm data to anticipate
affects of inertia and thrust on the internal gravity, then use its own
dedicated computer to do the calculations.

It\'s an interesting change that the artificial grav field is "directed
between the deck plates" rather than upward from the lower plate which is,
I think, the older explanation.  This new explanation makes it easier to
argue against using the same technology to generate "repulsors" or "tractor
beams" since it is implied that there need to be two plates or nodes
involved.

I\'ve always advocated the position that, unless you are in free fall, you
shouldn\'t get near a Jupiter sized (~3G surface gravity) planet with a 1G
accel ship (2G of art. grav).

An interesting implication is that if your luxury liner has a plexiglass
ceiling in the main dining salon the gravity comp is probably not efficient
in that area, leading to a bit of \'light footedness\'.  Perhaps a strange
looking ceiling fixture every few meters is placed in that area as well.

I phoned up (again) last week to see what\'s become of my October shipment
of Naval Architects Manual, and the chap I talked to (James) said that the
chap in Wisconsin doing the shipping (Tim Brown) was the one making the
mistakes, and that they were reorganizing so that this wouldn\'t happen
again.  

When I pointed out that I had heard that story twice before (it seems to
be the standard story I get whenever they bill me for something they don\'t
ship) he started talking about how it was all Tim\'s fault and how Anne
Flagella was overworked and how I should see the thousands of order that
were shipped successfully and... (at which point I told him that I was
paying for the call and hung up).

Oh yes, and he promised to ship my missing books immediately.  Guess what
hasn\'t arrived yet?

Needless to say, I am not impressed.

Why not combine them?  Not the engine, just the scoop.  You travel through
space until you get the necessary fuel to jump, then jump.  Travel, jump,
travel, jump, etc.

Speaking of monopoles, did anyone ever here of The Evening Star.  It was a
supplement for CT.  I don\'t remember who published it.  But the object of
the same name as the title was an abandoned monopole mine that had been
converted into a luxury resort.

That\'s resonable.

It also helps to explain how you can compensate for a thrust from the rear
that is parallel to the deck plates.  Which is how most of the ship designs
I\'ve seen seem to be arranged.  This would be particularly true of airframe
craft.

Sounds like a one way trip to me.  Unless you have CG lifters, your going
down.

I would use diamondpane, but I get the idea.  Perhaps like dispersed
antennas that work as a single unit, there would be some overlapping and the
effect would be unnoticeable unless the "window" was huge.  I mean we are
talking about a field effect here, right?

Now, as I visualize it, this is what happens. You\'re sitting on the rubber
sheet. You reach out and press down. Newton\'s Third Law says that while you\'re
pressing down your hand, the rest of your body is moving up. It\'s like this:

        Force of your hand pressing down = (-1) Force of your body moving up

Except that the forces are in opposite directions. From this we do this:

        (mass of hand) (acceleration down) = (-1) (mass of body) (acceleration
up)

Now, check my assumptions. The mass of your hand is so very much smaller than
the mass of your body, therefore the depression you\'re sitting in is quite a bit
deeper than the one you\'re making with your hand.

This means that a small depression won\'t make you slide toward it because you\'re
too deep in the large depression, and its attractive force is so large. In order
for you to slide toward the small depression, you must press down REALLY hard
with your hand, in order to create an acceleration large enough.

I\'ll just make up some numbers for illustrative purposes.

Suppose your body mass is 100kg and your hand is 1kg (totally unrealistic, but
they\'re nice numbers to work with). Now suppose that the attractive acceleration
in the large depression is 10m/(s^2). This means that the force your body
experiences in the large hole is = (100kg)(10m/(s^2)), or 1000 Newtons.

Your hand must press down with more than that amount of force to lift your body
out of the hole. This means that it must accelerate at more than (1000N)/(1kg),
or 1000m/(s^2), in order for you to be lifted.

That\'s pretty good acceleration!

I\'m sure you realise that to stretch out your hand (a massive object)
requires you expend energy, and the hand at the end of reach then has to
press down with more force (more mass or gravity depending on how you
look at it) than the rest of your body in order for you to slide forward
into the dimple. So, what you are proposing is a way to apply force (in
this case mass or gravitic force) at a distance...nice trick if you can
do it ;->  Anyway, this technique reminds me of ye\' ole tractor/pressor
beam.  One more thing, for it really to work you have to be able to lift
your analogus arm *off* the rubber mat, ie out of space/time)...again,
nice trick if you can do it.

Anders, you\'ve hit on the solution...if you didn\'t have religious
objections. ;->  All we have to do is invoke an aether mediated through
Zero Point Fluctuations in the Vacuum. Our reactionless drives turn into
ether propellers.

Hmmm. Doesn\'t sound like it\'s very clear. I\'d assume that the Low
Berth roll would\'nt use this. It\'s for medical rolls, like doing
surgery or something. The LB roll is not the same. You could let
skill of the operator help, but the sickbay wouldn\'t be used until
*after* a LB accident, IMHO.

Still, it isn\'t very clear.

Keep things simpler.  If the Vargr want to have status from scents,
they will simply use scents.  Designer fragrances could simply be
much more important among the Vargr than humans and they could be
equally imporant for both genders.  I human might see a Vargr
who is dressed unimpressively and not appreciate his status
because he sense of smell is so bad....

That, and the fact the they would have different sense of
color are the two things that I see a following logically
from the Vargr....

Please continue this thread, I am finding most interesting and enlightening.

I am trying to do the Roth Thokken as subrace of Vargr. Scents would even
mean more to the Roth due thier being born blind.

Given that FF&S2 now states that contragrav has a max forward acceleration

easily do 180 kph.  I would also except this figures to vary quite a bit

Can anyone provide real world figures (or even good guesses) on

Well, Stephen, it seems that Bureaucrats can get it on a roll of 4/5 just
like the Diplomats.

Actually, we\'ve had a few network failures.  Funny how things worked fine
until we switched to a centrally-managed Windows NT system...

I\'ve got a few messages from Dom, but I\'ve also been getting the TML
digests is reverse chronologucal order.  

I console myself withthe thought that, however bad our internal network
is, it would be far worse with IG running things... :-(

Planning to, but after the last phone call I had with IG I\'m not so eager.
 

So uneager, in fact, that I\'m writing to the Attorney General to complain
about IGs business practices.  No products three ^&*^*& months after
billing, and all James can do is make excuses and and another broken
promise.  I\'ve been understanding.  I\'ve been _more_ than understanding:
I\'ve been a sucker.  

No more.  Imperium Games can damn well cough up my books, plus interest
and the cost of phoning them, or I\'ll spend even more money just to get
even.  

I\'m sorry, Marc, but this has gone on long enough.  It\'s time that the
people using your name started treating their customers with a bit of
decency.  If you can\'t do something about it, I\'m going to try.

It is canon breaking, and it shouldn\'t be. The problem is not seeing
manuscripts before hand, and not having a discussion with the writers of those
manuscripts about reassurances that canon won;t be broken. A writer of
anything Traveller has a responsibility to know what is canon, and if writing
something that violates that, to discuss it (and get a yes or no) before it is
printed.

What follows is my (unfinished) Liaison skill definion, and a list of the
skills that will be in T4.1

Marc

	Liaison	Int, Soc
	The character has the ability to convey information and forge agreements
between differing cultures.

	Liaison, Admin, Carousing, Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, and Streetwise are related
skills. Carousing is the skill of meeting people and enjoying their company.
Admin is the skill of working within an organization. Fast Talk is the skill
of reaching short-term agreement. Liaison is the informal skill of
coordinating relationships between different cultures or organizations.
Diplomacy is the formal skill of negotiation between governments or large
organizations. Streetwise is the skill of dealing with local subcultures
without alienating them.

I will now take the unusual position (for me, anyway) of lobbying Marc to
change something.

Marc, using a firearm is based on your ability to control the weapon as it
fires.  This is a function of Strength.  Think back to your own days in
basic.  Remember the emphasis on firm control and proper squeezing of the
trigger?

I am humbly asking that you consider making this change.  I base my idea on
my own experience as a sniper in the US Army.  I\'ve hit targets out to
800m, and I\'m the original klutz.

(What I reaaly wish is that Marc would get ahold of ACQ, realize that it\'s
the Greatest Traveller Combat System (tm) since Snapshot, and put it in
Traveller.. but I\'ll be realistic.)

Ah, the land of the long white cloud.  Home to Fitzy!  Steven Fitzpatrick,
hooker and captain for the All-Blacks.  My idol.  (Yeah, I\'m a front-row player,
10 years under my belt so I understand whats going on, but now I\'m in a poor
position to do anything about it ;-)  You got any of the "honay" I think its
called - the stuff where you dig a hole, throw in a pig, cover it, smoke it, eat
it, usually around Xmas?  I\'ve seen it on film and my buds from Rotorua say its
unbeleiveable.

One day,  I will learn to tell a man from Wellington by the way he holds his hat
when he turns a corner.

This isn\'t suprising.  I hate to say it, but I doubt your threat of legal action
even raised an eyebrow.  I\'d represent you, after I pass the bar in July, but it
would be a long, boring, and probably unfruitful exercise.

Blaming an individual, even if you believe you\'ve been given the name
correctly, is rarely a wise move.  I hope Tim isn\'t catching any touble for
your post.  Having siad that , individuals are capable of wrecking havok on
companies, especially small ones.

My question to you is, why order stuff from IG anyway?  While geography is
probably the answer, I would never, ever, ever, order a product sight
unseen.  Especially RPG materials which are (with very rare exception,
Traveller sometimes included within that small group), inherently
unreliable.  Naval Architect\'s Manual has been on the shelves in Dallas, TX
stores since at least December 17.  I was able to thumb through this book
several times before finally buying it last wekk in Boston  (If it weren\'t
so useful towards my interest in developing Space Stations, I wouldn\'t have
bought it).

But then, perhaps I\'m too much of a penny-pincher, living on student loans
and all.

I hope you get it soon and I hope it was worht your wait.  But I also hope
the delay doesn\'t build your expectations because this book has a very
limited interest I should think.  No offense to its designers.  Its of great
use to me, I\'m just doubting that the great unwashed hordes of Trav Fans are
beating down the doors for this product in particular.  For Aslan and Vargyr
stuff, maybe.

In that case, get your advice now, while I\'m still a student and prohibited by law
from giving legal assitance in any official fashion.  Its free.  Once July comes
though, I\'m obligated by law to leech as much money out of all parties as possible.

Modulators" is IMO easy to fix - just add 1 to the survival roll per TL
over 10, but snake eyes still results in death/injury/disfigurement.

A related but IMO more major problem is what hot bunking and overcrowding
staterooms does to travel costs - putting 2 Middle Passengers into a small
stateroom makes more sense from a profit POV than carrying a single High
Passenger.

This double-bunking will cost Cr 1000 each in "life support costs", plus
one-half of the net Cr9 000 the stateroom could earn by carrying a single
High Passenger. Therefore the cost of travelling 3rd class should be around
Cr 5500, as compared to Cr 8000 for 2nd class (ie standard Middle Passage).

Under FFS2, you can hot-bunk in a 14m3 bunk, and fit 2 people into it. A
low berth also takes up 14m3, and fits one. Assuming type III life support
on the ship and 21 kg of Meager meals each (cost Cr 126 each for 2 weeks).

This puts the cost of bunking at awfully close to the traditional Cr 100
overhead for a low berth.

It wont be a comfortable trip, but it beats running the low lottery.

Eyeballing the numbers, and assuming the magic Cr 1000 per person cost for
"life support costs", the cost of a 4th class passage should be Cr 1750 or
so (food, Cr 130 ; "life support" Cr 1000 ; 0.5 dtons ship space, Cr 500 ;
profit/marketing/whatever Cr 120).

This is equivalent to about the average income of a TL8 world in Imperial
Credits.

I *think* that the numbers given are for 1G and partially streamlined
hulls. More gees and an airframe hull will get you more thrust or increased
thrust efficiency (see table 162 on p104).

The alternative for a craft that really wants higher speed is to put an
auxilary atmospheric propulsion unit on it - props, a rotor or a jet engine
on it to help out the contragrav.

As far as I understand, contragrav is basically designed to get you out of
gravity wells, not for mucking around in them.

Having followed UN politics reasonably closely, I think that this is a tad
optimistic to say that the UN negotiating team wouldnt be "regionally
balanced".

I would say that each of the old major spacegoing powers would have a rep
on the committee, plus one from the Africa bloc, one from the South/Central
America bloc, one from China and one from Western European and Others (ie
Canada/Sweden/other Euro/Australia/New Zealand).

That puts one EEC, one USA, one Ukraine, one Russian, one Chinese, one
Japanese, one Africa, one South American and one WEO (I\'m assuming China
and Japan are also spacegoing powers, which is IMO reasonable).

I also suspect that the teams would have a mix of civilians and military
types - and I wouldnt assume the military would be the hawks, either.

Since a committee of nine is a bit unweildy, how about two subcommittees,
Military and Economic ?

Also, from the other side, I think ambassadors is putting it a bit
strongly. I suspect an assistant underflunky for the Sub-regional Governor
and the Mine Manager of the Barnard\'s Star facility sounds about right,
plus maybe a seconded Fleet Captain with experience of Minor Race Liaison.

Could make a great freeform though ...

Well, to start off. 

In these Enertopia, there should be a greater proportion of semi-skilled
labour living in them. Somebody has to clear the branches, maintain the
dams and chop the firewood. As any self-sustaining colony, even if
relying on outside supplies and inhabitants, will need such \'Mexican\'
labour. On a remote planet, esp. so in the early phases, they are much
needed for manual work. Construction, repair, logistics are certainly
much more slower than planning. 

I wouldn\'t find commerce located there until a substantial residential
base is reached. Much as military field camps, early American colonies,
rural slums: they start from technicians to wealth accumulation to
trading. Medium of exchange: cigarettes, barter (with Indians) and
labour (for slums). 

Traditionally wealth accumulation was from industrial complexes (labour)
or war (stealing) that exploited local / captured and (lately - 20th
century) imported resources that led to trading. These have a limit as
the end of industrial production is consumer market saturation. Assuming
zero or negative population growth rate.

Therein, the reason financial trading appears at a later stage. Whether
located off-world on distant soil (eg: established exchanges) is also
possible. The reason being financial trading must be carried out in
legal tender that is recognized by existing sovereignty, to be
convertible.

I guess, there is a size before a colony gets too many numerous tasks
(complexity) for the administration. Then new admin zones may be appear
to coordinate new social and tech tasks. As more people / new
generations / new colonist shift their activities to newer tasks, the
central admin will be surrounded by other admin centres, which if not
the same in importance (measurable by pop / monetary terms) at least
indispensable.

I say, keep the Dex!

Decompression
	The environment for the character (vac suit, building, vehicle) loses
pressure.
	Slow Leak. Suffocate-1 per hour.
	Major Leak. Suffocate-1 per ten minutes.
	Explosive Decompression. Suffocate-1 per combat round.

This is based on the T4.1 hit system (abridged pertinent version below). By my
reading, the average guy will survive 42 seconds before unconsciousness and be
dead in about 2 minutes.

Now AC Clarke wrote a story once that covered a mass transfer of (space
miners) from one stricken ship to another without space suits (there weren\'t
enough to go round). I don\'t remember his time for survival, and the
characters weren\'t explosive decompressed (and were ready for the crisis).

Marc Miller


 THE TRAVELLER HIT SYSTEM
	The Traveller Hit System imposes hits (measures of injury or damage) on
characters in increments. Hits are imposed on the targets Physical
Characteristics (Strength, Dexterity, or Endurance) in any order. When one
characteristic is reduced to zero, the character is unconscious. When two
characteristics are reduced to zero, the character is seriously wounded. When
three characteristics are reduced to zero, the character is dead.
	Types of Hit Generators. Hits can be generated in a number of ways (although
all hits then are implemented against the common set of physical
characteristics). Hits are generated by Hits, Cuts, Cold, and Heat.

Special Injury and Effects
	Suffocate is applied to Intelligence (instead of the three physical
characteristics). When Intelligence is reduced to zero, the character is
unconscious. When Suffocate equal to twice Intelligence are  received, the
character is in a coma; when Suffocate equal to three times Intelligence, the
character is dead.

How Many Hits?
	The number of hits (or the severity of Special Injury) is determined by the
weapon or event inflicting the damage. For example, a Rifle may impose 3D
Hits, a Pistol may impose 1D Hits, and a Flash-Bang (a type of grenade) may
impose 3D Blind and 3D Deafen.
 
Hit Effects:
	nD indicates the number (n) of dice (D) rolled for the injury. In addition,
the effect includes +D - D.
	nD Hits. Roll for number of hits received.
	nD Suffocate. Roll for number of hits received per turn, which are applied to
Intelligence.
 
HIT EFFECT VARIANCE
	All hit effects (Hits, Suffocate) are subject to a variance of +/- 5 (based
on a +D-D roll). When hits are inflicted, the final value is then adjusted by
a +D-D roll. For example, 6D Hits is read as 6D +D -D Hits.

Vac					uu	uu								Suff. Hits.
u= Inflicts Hits (Hits, Cold, Heat, and Suffocate).

PROTECTION
	LungShield. Protects against nD Suffocate. Eliminates any effect of Gas.

	Well a low tech fusion reactor is big, here is our german one :

	Gesamtdurchmesser                15 Meter	diameter
	Hhe                             ca. 4 Meter	height

	Magnetfeldstrke                 3 Tesla	megnetizing force

	add one techlevel and they know what to do with the energy.

	This reactor is NOT a Tokamak, but a Wendelstein. Its not burning

	the experiment for the large one they currently build in Greifswald,

	Well T4 has KKMs but a broken space combat system. A cumulative

In my original post I reported what I was told, along with the person (at
IG) who told me.  Possibly James was confused.  (Marc\'s response would
support this hypothesis.)  But seeing as it was the only response I got
out of IG I decided to pass it along (for what it\'s worth).

Personally, I think that blaming someone else rather than trying to
satisfy the customer is a shitty way of handling customer service.  But
that\'s what happened.  (James did promise to send me my books.  They
should have arrived by now.  They haven\'t.)


>
>
>My question to you is, why order stuff from IG anyway?  


Two reasons.  First, to get the stuff quicker (such was their original
promise).  Second, for the discount.

Neither reason has worked in practice.  Although the Toronto game shops
don\'t get it very quickly, Fandom II in Ottawa (a mere five hours drive
away) always gets the stuff in right after release.  And their price is
actually cheaper than my discounted price from IG!

Now, while I would be willing to pay a bit more for reasonable delivery, I
see no reason to pay extra for non-delivery.  Hence the formal complaint
to the Attorney General.


As I said, I\'ve been a sucker.  I\'ve let twenty years of enthusiastic
support for Traveller overwhelm my judgement several times.  (This is the
third time I\'ve had trouble with IG. Each time they have claimed that they
were changing the system to ensure that it wouldn\'t happen again.)

Agreed 100%. The question is, how are you going to make sure this happens? IG 
have made it very clear they neither know nor care about canon.

Never having fired anything more powerful than an air rifle I\'m not really 
qualified to answer, but hey, that\'s never stopped me in the past...

I assume you\'re talking about recoil? Wouldn\'t that only apply to the second 
and subsequent rounds? By the time you feel the recoil from the first shot, 
the bullet has already left the gun, so it\'ll basically hit where you 
pointed it (which is DEX-based). And what about lasers, or slug throwers 
with negligible recoil?

You have my sympathies. I helped shear sheep once. Since I was
inexperienced, I got then fun job of holding the next sheep (ie they
are shearing one sheep, and I\'m holding the one they\'ll shear next). 

The only paractical way to do this is to straddle the sheep, facing
forward and wrap your arms around its neck. By the end of the day,
lanolin could *easily* be extracted from your clothing.

In my case, two reasons. First, convenience - it\'s easier than hunting 
through the shops trying to find them (plus, subscribers to the pre-order 
scheme were supposed to get the books before the shops, although that 
promise soon went out the window). Secondly, and more importantly, I want 
Traveller to succeed. For that to happen, IG must succeed. Ordering direct 
from them means they get more money out of the deal (since there are no 
third parties taking their cut). However, unless things at IG change for the 
better PDQ (a simple "sorry, we\'ll try harder" would be a good start), I\'m 
going to cancel my sub.

You and the cork move towards each other. And the process of throwing
the cork *forward* again will cause you and the cork to return to the
original positions.

Remember, you are in free fall, *not* on a planet.

So, when you throw the magnet forward, you go *backwards*. When you and
the magnet finish atracting each other, you are back where you were
when you threw it.

That\'s the way the universe *works*.

Well, barring breakthroughs (which, by their nature we can\'t foresee or
we\'d be doing it *now*), you\'ll need semiconductors for most
electronics, simply because you have to control electrical current at
some point. Optical and quantum computers are possible, but they\'d
still need electronics to couple  them to most systems (just like we
need mechanical items to use electricity to control flows of liquid/gas)

Semiconductors are a pretty restricted set. They have to either be
elements from group IV on the periodic chart, or compounds of Group III
and Group V elements.

Group III: B, Ga, ...
Group  IV: C, Si, Ge, ...
Group   V: N, P, As, ...

GaAs and GaP are being worked with to some extent. But they are
restricted to special uses, partly because they are a bitch to make,
and partly because gallium isn\'t exactly the most common element.

I\'ve heard talk of research into *diamond* based semiconductors. Those
could be very intertesting if they work at all.

	Well I think it was "sea freight", as there is no land bridge
	between NZ and US. BTW: I\'m the programmer of a book importer,
	and we have to tell our customers, that air freight is priceless
	for a single book, and they have to wait 2 weeks for UK, 6 weeks
	for US and 12 weeks for australian/japanes books, under condition
	that the book is available from a wholesaler. Backorder inside
	US adds another 2-6 weeks (FASA is known of 12 weeks for backorder,
	so IG is realy good ;-).

	As we tell\'m straight, they can understand and live with that
	fact, even if they are used that a german book takes maximum
	2 days for delivery !

	Perhaps IG should improve message handling, and clarify their
	terms of delivery to customers outside US. Yes I know that this
	is a cost intensive factor, but its necessary if you want that
	a customer buys a second time.

	I recently read through COACC (MT) and their atmos speed is
	certainly broken for low tech planes. Does anybody has a
	comparision for TL:6-8 planes ?

	Comparison :

	COACC Ypress (WW I fighter 2 seats)

	(Real) RAF SE5a (single seat)

		200 hp hispano suiza
	below 5000 feet
		cruise 100 miles/h, top 130 miles/h, takeoff 50 mph.
		maximum dive 280 mph,
	ceiling 22.000 feet.
		cruise  70 mph, top 110 mph, minimum 70 mph.

	And the RAF SE5a was one of the best, double seat figher have been

I disagree that what you are describing here is a function of strength. As
I recall, even the little weasely guys at basic had no trouble qualifying
expert.
I think that proper hold of the weapon, eye relief, breathing, and all that
stuff is more related to dexterity. We agree on what proper firing
technique is, but not on the attribute that governs it.

We may be talking about two variations of dexterity here, and I\'m not sure
that there\'s an easy way to distinguish the two in T4 terms. There\'s
physical dexterity (like tripping over your own boots), and manual
dexterity (fine tool manipulation).
Firing weapons, particularly sniper rifles, goes into the second category.
I can see an argument for having Submachine gun as a strength based skill,
because the primary limitation to accuracy is controlling the recoil, but
for single shots...

I don\'t want to start a "I have better credentials than you" war - so let\'s
just say I have experience as well.

Most of us should be familiar with the typified Zhodani ship shape: the one
made popular by FASA, which has appeared on various Imperial unit logos
(usually in the center of crosshairs). Just in case, it\'s a small diamond
on the end of a long neck, with an oblong main hull shape (the picture is a
much better reference).

My question is what hull configuration it would fall under. I\'m torn
between wedge and medium or long rounded cylinders, but then again it might
also qualify as some other shape.

Dwarf collection and reading Tomas Price\'s article on Startports.  The 
overall sizes that Price proposes are broadly similar to those that I

Here is a quick run down:
Price                                    Early
A	3 runways (5 km x 1 km) 
        600 berths		         1200 berths
	40 sq miles		         60 sq miles
	60 Naval berths
B	2 runways (5 km x 1 km)
        200 berths
	20 sq miles
	10 scout berths
C	1 runway (5 km x 1 km)
        75 berths
	10 sq miles
	10 scout berths
D	1 runway (5 km x 1 km) 
        20 berths
	8 sq miles
	19 scout berths
E	1 runway (5 km x 1 km)
	No berths		       6 berths
	3 sq miles		       0.5 sq miles
	10 scout berths

As others have said, the wide-scale use of conta-grav and T-plates 
means that the runways are unlikely to be used by starships (Price 
argued in the days of Classic Traveller that fusion-powered starships 
used lots of reaction mass if they were to "land on their tails", and 
that gliding in like the shuttle would save 9 T of fuel for a 100 T 
scout).  However, for some referees the use of runways will be 
appropriate for both starships and in-system traffic.

==========

Systems may (will) contain secondary (and tertiary) planets with 
people, starports, minerals and so on.  The UPP refers only to the 
major planet in the system.  Population usually refers to the total 
number of intelligent beings there - normally all oxygen breathers.  
The "Start Wars" cantina scene contains only creatures that fit into 
this band - all can be talked to and all breathe the same air.

<I missed the question>   a world where the TL equivalent is achieved 
by bio-engineered objects (computers, beds, cars (?),  etc.).

Communications between different races is not covered in Traveller 
because it assumes the widespread availability and usage of mechanical 
and electronic translator units.  If you encounter a very unusual 
language, or lose your translator, then all sorts of problems could 
ensue.

The Imperium derives much of its income from corporation taxation 
(being easy to impose) and holdings in many (mega) corporations.  8% of 
LSP is a lot!

A meagcorporporation is defined as one so large that the right hand 
doesn\'t know what the left hand is doing.  For example, a particular 
section of a mega may decide that it would be nice to control a certain 
planet.  They decide to hire mercenaries to take over, but they do not 
realise that a company already owns stock in the current owners of the 
plant (themselves a reasonably-sized company). And that this company is 
wholly controlled by another part of the same megacorporation.  To 
check with every part of the corporation about a particular decision 
would take several years because the corporation has such widespread 
interests.

Planet-based computer systems will hold data on a sub-sector wide 
basis.  Sub-sector capitals will hold data on a sector-wide basis.  
Sector capitals will have information covering many sectors (the 
surrounding eight, and possibly further afield).

Being an ex-member of the Imperial forces gives no benefits with 
respect to access to official computer records (they have no sure way 
of proving who you are unless you were discharged within the 
sub-sector).  If you are able to contact a friend however 
Scouts have a complex (and difficult to falsify) ID that gives them 
access as detached duty scouts.  If the ID is lost, you must return to 
the world of your discharge to prove your identity and have the ID 
re-issued.

Starports have many parallel with modern airports (e.g. it is not 
illegal to have drugs, just to try and take them through customs.  This 
is the real meaning of extra-territoriality).  Starports are usually 
controlled by the locals, if they are of high enough TL.

It may be amusing for some people to be allergic to (or develop 
allergies to) anagathics.

Andory and Candory/Five Sisters are Droyne worlds - that is why they 
are interdicted.

The TL of a plant is only a generalisation.  Various developments may 
be different.  America is TL 8 but does not have air/raft or common 
fusion but does have advanced computers and a very high average wealth; 
Uganda is TL 2-3 but has radar (TL 5) and jets (TL 6-7) and the trained 
personnel to operate them.

In-system jumps are possible, but still take a week.

There is no racial or sexual bias amongst Imperial citizens 
(theoretically).

Zho\'s hate Imp\'s.  Imp\'s hate Zho\'s.  Sol\'s (secretly) hate Imp\'s, but 
the Imperium is too big so the Sol\'s hate Aslan.  Aslan like Imp\'s 
because the Sol\'s hate them (!).  Vargr hate Imp\'s (and some Vargr hate 
Zho\'s).  Centaurs hate Vargr.  Vargr hate Centaurs.  Hivers are too 
nice and recluse to hate or be hated.

System defence generally consists of 1 to 5 squadrons.  Each squadron 
bay be 2 to 8 large ships (10,000 to 50,000 T) with appropriate support 
ships, or several hundred (sometines several thousand) 400-ton SDB\'s..

System Defence boat strategy is well understood.  SDB\'s are well armed 
and armoured and if they should be defeated in fleet action, the 
survivors are ideally suited to guerrilla warfare - hiding in oceans, 
resupply at hidden caches on moons or in pre-arranged orbits, waiting 
at the bottom of the gravity well of a gas giant (when refuelling ships 
are at their weakest), refuelling from ice fields on moons, etc.

There are stars in "empty" hexes, but as they have no (useful) planets 
they are not shown on the standard map.

When a vessel jumps it initially uses a large amount of fuel very 
rapidly (at low efficiency) to charge up capacitors to very high levels 
(that can only be held for short periods of time).  This energy then 
"flashes" the ship into jumpspace where a small continuing fuel usage 
keeps the jump field up.
Improved capacitors now allow the charge to be held long enough (a few 
minutes) for L-Hyd tanks to be usable .. but not tankers yet!
Returning to normal space (to a lower potential) gives back the large 
amount of energy initially used.  This must be lost rapidly by the use 
of energy sinks or it can be a source of trouble (being flicked back 
into jump is embarrassing if you have no fuel to maintain the jump 
field for a week).

Power plants can produce more energy than "normal", by being run as if 
jump is being prepared for - a lot more energy from vastly more fuel 
use - and this can be used to power weapons.

790-800 saw the Imperial suppression of psionics (the rest not repeated 
here as this information has been repeated often - including T4 Psionic 
Institutes).

The usual forms of government used in Traveller are:

Republic - normal "capital" rule.  Normally, a planet is the largest 
form of republic

Federation - fairly tight organisation of republics with one capital.  
There is limited autonomy for members, sufficient to handle local laws 
(no parking tickets on empty worlds; strict water pollution laws on a 
water world; etc.).  Several planets in a system up to several systems 
can form a federation.

Confederation - a larger but looser form than the federation.  Trade 
between members is encouraged and there are likely to be import 
restrictions on goods from outside the confederation.  Confederations 
usually span no more than a sub-sector.

Empire - the largest and loosest form of government.  Member states 
have great autonomy (that is why there is the ruling nobility - to make 
executive decisions).  The Emperor and his forces provide protection 
for the spacelanes and general guidance.  An unfit Emperor is usually 
assassinated.

Postal union - allowing the free trade of post hurts no-one and 
benefits all and is common between all empires, confederations, etc.

The benfits of Empire may not be great to a corporate-owned planet 
(since the Empire will not usually undertake system defence and 
corporation taxes generally exceed the cost of a space Navy).  
Mega-corps have little choice in paying taxes unless ownership is 
covert - profits are not declared or are used to develop unknown wolrds 
(outside the Imperium).

Tariffs prevent/inhibit the import of unwanted goods, normally for 
commercial reasons.  They protect local interests and promote the 
improvement of local tech level.

The Zhodani "thought police" are really Morality Guardians and liked by 
the populace, who treat them with the same respect that doctors get - 
they cure you when you are unhappy with the Zhodani Consulate.

   This assumes that bare metal superdense, what hulls are made out of
at TL 12, is shiny (can\'t say that\'s ever been stated), and that the
inital cost savings isn\'t lost over time because of the increased
maintenance costs involved.  My assumption has always been that
spacecraft \'paint\' isn\'t just paint--it would contain anti-corrosive
agents that give the ship protection against damage from exposure to
water, methane, ammonia, certain other chemicals found in tainted
atmospheres, and even retard the damage caused by exotic, and other
extreme atmospheric gas types.  There would also be some sort of under
coat or even a glaze applied after the paint that reduces (or at high
TLs) the damage caused by micrometeors.

   Ultimately then, the trade off would be smaller initial cost up front
versus significantly shorter hull life.  While long hull life is perhaps
not important in the case of emergency lifeboats or wartime expedient
hulls, but for practically everyone else *crucial* IMHO.

   What **we** know of--there\'s no telling how many people who are not
members of this list are having problems--could be more, could be less. 
IMHO, it\'s probably about the same.  I don\'t think the people at IG have
it in for TMLers.

   Unfortunately that\'s exactly what the individual from IG did.  Was he
lying to make IG look better?  I don\'t know, but if I were Tim, and IG
made a habit of blaming him for their company problems, I would have a
*major* issue with it.

   Let\'s assume that you are the leader of a country that has a gross
domestic product equal to about a quarter of the world total.  That
makes you a major player on that planet.  Now, let\'s say that you are
faced with a potential enemy that has over 11,000 worlds, hundreds of
which have a higher GDP than your entire planet.  If you lose a war
against the potential enemy, you will be *absorbed*, your culture erased
and your people forced to live under the boot of an interstellar empire
which isn\'t above genocide in meeting "corporate goals" (or so your
translators tell you).

   Are you going to allow petty squabblings that have pretty much been
resolved to cause the downfall of your civilization?

However, keeping the weapon on target as a small explosion goes off inches
from your head, and a couple of grams of lead flies out the barrel is a
function of strength.  No matter how carefully you sight in, if you can\'t
keep control of that wepaon at the moment of firing, it\'s all for naught.

My early shooting experience was with the M-16A1.. a 5.56mm rifle that has
almost no recoil.  It required a good solid grip to hit anything.

Pointing the gun at something is certainly a DEX task.  Making sure the
barrel doesn\'t move a quarter-inch (throwing the strike off by 3 feet at
100 meters) is a function of strength.  This is true of every weapon I\'ve
ever fired, from .22 pistols through the .50cal Sniper Rifle.

No, just use a misjump. Since FTL violates the *same* laws of physics
that time travel does, allowing a misjump to move you thru time is not
unreasonable. 

BTW, if they compare their charts with the M0 charts, they\'ll have to
conclude that they\'ve come out in a *different* universe, as the stars
don\'t match. :-)

Nice try. But if you are pushing down on the sheet in "front" of you,
you are *lessening* the push your ship makes. Also, you *won\'t* fall
into the dimple, as you are creating it a *fixed* distance in front of
you (the length of your arm). To get closer to it, you\'d have to pull
in your arm. 

And it takes work (energy) both to make the dimple, and to pull in your
arm while maintaining the dimple.

    I think that strength is a very minor part, at least w/ the M16A2 and the
M9, but is necessary w/ the 240 MGs (G and E) keeping the machine gun from
kicking your ass.  And the .50 cal is just getting in that proper position.
You couldn\'t muscle that one if u wanted to.  (All Marines fire out to 500m w/
the M16... i can\'t remember what the rangers were the MGs and MK19) I don\'t
know bout the US Army, but the USMC always taught me to not "muscle" the
weapon.  The recoil is gonna be there and there\'s not much u can do about it.
You want control over your weapon of course. It also worthy to note that one
is supposed to "squeeze" the trigger than than "pull" the trigger.  STR would
tell me "pulling" was going on rather than "squeezing, " but it could be just
semantics to some people... ; ) One of the detractions about going burst w/
the M16, your aim goes all to hell.   Even Heavy Weapons (assuming this
contains Grenade Launchers as it did for TNE)... I didn\'t even notice the 203.
The hardest part for me was estimating where it was going to land. Maybe i
wasn\'t paying attn or something but i thought that damned quadrant sight was
next to useless.  Maybe INT?  ; ) 
    Anyways... I like AGL... i mean DEX ; )  for slug pistols and rifles.

No... i do like AGL! : P

suspended animation in Traveller\'s Digest # 21 went into great detail 
about this, talking about how low berth travel became much safer by TL 11.

In their rules, it was possible to simply pop someone out of a low berth
without knowing anything about medicine.  This was quite risky (a
difficult task).  However, a trained starship medic who does the proper
systems checks reduces this to a routine task (which with Med-2 and a 
normal EDU resulted in success on a 4+).  In addition, failure simply 
meant rolling on the task system failure table which usually mention 
minor damage to the individual being revived, death was impossible 
unless the systems checks were not performed.  

This always made much more sense to me.  Except for emergency low berths
in lifeboats *no one* would use something which killed you even 1/12th of
the time you used it.  This is little better than Russian roulette, and I
don\'t see *that* being terribly popular.  Having a serious risk of death
every time you used a low berth always made little sense to me as a
sensible thing to have in a thriving high-tech civilization.  During the 
Long Night or in the Virus era I can see folks regularly taking such risks, 
but not in the Imperium.  

In the Digest Group version low berths wouldn\'t be terribly popular
because it was uncomfortable and could give the user hangover-like
symptoms or even frostbite.  It\'s not terribly dangerous, but it\'s fairly
unpleasant.  Therefore, it would remain the travel choice of the very poor
only, which is what we want.

(From the sci.space FAQ:)

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE 

If you *don\'t* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a 
minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your 
breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to 
watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your 
Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal 
experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no 
immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do 
not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness. 

Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some 
[mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue) 
start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from 
lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes, 
you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.

Too fast. I\'m *extremely* unfit, but I can hold my breath for longer than 42 
seconds without passing out, and some people can manage 2-3 minutes. I suggest 
you double these (ie 1 pt every other round).

It is generally understood that even explosive decompression will not cause
the human body to explode.  The eyes might pop out if not closed, but the
body will not explode.

Surface (skin) bruising will begin almost immediately.  Holding  your breath
is impossible and IIRC, one of the worst things you can try to do.  If you
hyperventilated before exiting and exhaled as much air as possible
before/during initial exposure to vacuum, I believe that you could retain
consciousness for as much as 5 or 6 minutes.  Shortly after loosing
consciousness, your heart would stop beating (the most common definition
of "clinical death").

The vacuum exposure victim, would probably be resuscitatable for several
minutes beyond the point of clinical death, however, the longer you go
without oxygen, the greater your chance of irrecoverable brain damage and
the longer your recovery time will be (if you loose consciousness or not).

I believe that this is one of the "done to death questions".  The responses
of others are available at:

Disinformation, pure and simple.  Or -- if you prefer -- the Ancients kept
there most dangerous/interesting experiments a comfortable three and a bit
subsectors away, down in Five Sisters, and hence that\'s the important
prize.  Or perhaps there\'s another explanation...or perhaps not.  It
rains.  Fnord.

You should really learn to quit when *you* are ahead, Frater...er, friend. 

M C of the U pretty much sums it up.  All races feel a tug toward the
Marches, and Five Sisters in particular.  It pulled the C-Jammer across
a ludicrous distance in *realspace* (!), only to fall mere parsecs short
of the goal; it dragged the Third Imperium out on a long arm of
colonization beyond their natural borders; it beckoned the Aslan Ihatei
across the Rift; it made the peaceable Zhodani willing to initiate
hostilities in order to get closer; it called Vargr corsairs deep into
Imperial space to their doom.  The TNE Regency succeeded in holding off
Virus largely because it included Five Sisters, and the Templars seriously
distrust machine intelligences (another long story there).

Across the unreverberant void of limitless space, the Call of Candory
wails its siren song...

The "Max forward acceleration" for contragrav in FFS2 is one of those
things that seemed like a good idea at the time, but should probably
be ignored - it (as you note) makes fast vehicles impossible, and is
hard to make fit with various other aspects of the game.

Every six months this question gets asked.  Consult the sci.space FAQ;
it\'s discussed in great detail there.

Briefly, survival in vacuum is probably possible for a minute or so. 
Consciousness will go away much more rapidly than that.

 from _Bioastronautics Data Book_, Second edition, NASA SP-3006, edited
by James F. Parker and Vita R. West, 1973, in the article "Chapter 1:
Barometric Pressure," by Charles E. Billings:

page 5, (following a general discussion of low pressures and ebullism):
[on decompression to vacuum] "Some degree of consciousness will probably
be retained for 9 to 11 seconds (see chapter 2 under Hypoxia).  In rapid
sequence thereafter, paralysis will be followed by generalized
convulsions and paralysis once again.  During this time, water vapor will
form rapidly in the soft tissues and somewhat less rapidly in the venous
blood.  This evolution of water vapor will cause marked swelling of the
body to perhaps twice its normal volume unless it is restrained by a
pressure suit.  (It has been demonstrated that a properly fitted elastic
garment can entirely prevent ebullism at pressures as low as 15 mm Hg
absolute [Webb, 1969, 1970].)  Heart rate may rise initially, but will
fall rapidly thereafter.  Arterial blood pressure will also fall over a
period of 30 to 60 seconds,  while venous pressure rises due to
distention of the venous system by gas and vapor.  Venous pressure will
meet or exceed arterial pressure within one minute.  There will be
virtually no effective circulation of blood.  After an initial rush of
gas from the lungs during decompression, gas and water vapor will
continue to flow outward through the airways.  This continual evaporation
of water will cool the mouth and nose to near-freezing temperatures; the
remainder of the body will also become cooled, but more slowly.

"Cook and Bancroft (1966) reported occasional deaths of animals due to
fibrillation of the heart during the first minute of exposure to near
vacuum conditions.  Ordinarily, however, survival was the rule if
recompression occurred within about 90 seconds. ... Once heart action
ceased, death was inevitable, despite attempts at resuscitation....
[on recompression] Breathing usually began spontaneously... Neurological
problems, including blindness and other defects in vision, were common
after exposures (see problems due to evolved gas), but usually
disappeared fairly rapidly.

"It is very unlikely that a human suddenly exposed to a vacuum would have
more than 5 to 10 seconds to help himself.  If immediate help is at hand,
although one"s appearance and condition will be grave, it is reasonable
to assume that recompression to a tolerable pressure (200 mm Hg, 3.8
psia) within 60 to 90 seconds could result in survival, and possibly in
rather rapid recovery."

>The subject of explosive decompression comes up so often on sci.space.tech
that I\'ve decided to keep a file on the suject.  In brief, if you keep your
mouth *wide* open to avoid rupturing your lungs, you can expect to stay
conscious in complete vacuum for ten to twenty seconds.  If you are
recompressed within one to two minutes, you will probably survive the
experience.  In short, Clarke (in _2001_) seens to have gotten it about
right, since Bowman manages to close the airlock in the ten seconds of
consciousness he has available..

>Among other things, it has the only published discussion I\'ve ever seen of
the JSC (well, it was MSC then) suit technician who spent 20 seconds in
vacuum in Dec 1966 when a suit umbilical came loose during a vacuum- chamber
test.  The pressure drop was slowed somewhat by the remaining section of
hose, so it wasn\'t fast enough to cause lung damage.  He passed out,
presumably from anoxia, after 12-15s.  Pressure began to be restored at 20s
and was well up at 27s, at about which time he regained consciousness.  He
was apparently uninjured, and aftereffects were minor and temporary.

 seconds."

>Roth says that vapor bubbles form in the bloodstream essentially
instantaneously delays under 1s but initially are not serious enough to 
 stop circulation.  Eventually they are.  Worse, these bubbles begin as water
vapor, but then they start to pick up dissolved gases from the blood... and
while the water vapor will condense out almost instantaneously on
repressurization, the gases redissolve much more slowly, and the resulting
long-lived bubbles are potentially a very serious threat.  There are medical
countermeasures, which Roth discusses, but most of them unfortunately rely
on gravity (for example, a well-chosen prone position on one side at about 
a 30-degree head-down slope keeps bubbles in the heart away from the valves
and gives time for the bubbles to dissolve or be dealt with medically).

>Gregory Bennett adds:

>Incidentally, we have had one experience with a suit puncture on the
Shuttle flights.  On STS-37, during one of my flight experiments, the palm
restraint in one of the astronaut\'s gloves came loose and migrated until 
it punch a hole in the pressure bladder between his thumb and forefinger. It
was explosive decompression, just a little 1/8 inch hole, but it was
exciting down here in the swamp because it was the first injury we\'ve ever
had from a suit incident.  Amazingly, the astronaut in question didn\'t 
even know the puncture had occured; he was so hopped on adrenalin it wasn\'t
until after he got back in that he even noticed there was a painful red
mark on his hand.  He figured his glove was chafing and didn\'t worry about
it.

>The whole story didn\'t come out until the suits were back home and a suit
technician was setting up to clean that glove; he discovered the dried blood
on the outer TMG (thermal micrometeoroid garment) and then found the wayward
palm restraint bar.  What happened: when the metal bar punctured the glove,
the skin of the astronaut\'s hand partially sealed the opening.  He bled 
into space, and at the same time his coagulating blood sealed the opening
enough that the bar was retained inside the hole. 

>The best estimate we\'ve been able to get from the flight surgeons about 
 how long an astronaut might survive a catastrophic suit failure is
"several tens of seconds to very few minutes" with almost certainty for
detectable permanent damage.

Interesting use of Intelligence as hit points. Makes sense to me, as
survival is going to depend on keeping your cool.

You might want to include some Cold Hits, perhaps 1 per ten minutes in Slow
or Major Leaks, and 1 per minute in Explosive Decompression.

Another problem is ebullism - see my accompanying post on vac exposure. Gas
bubbles in the blood might kill a PC even if recompression is quickly
achieved. Survival would perhaps require a test of END, difficulty
depending on how long the PC was exposed to vac. Even if this test is
failed, the PC might still survive if treated immediately by another PC:
Difficult test of Medical, with bonuses if a sick bay or autodoc is nearby.

Finally, you might note that exposure to vacuum for more than ten seconds
will break a lot of capillaries in the skin, giving the PC a bad case of
\'vacuum rose\', as Greg Bear calls it (in _Moving Mars_). In my game, I call
it \'vac burn\'. Any exposed area of skin ends up looking like the nose of an
aging rummy.

Very interesting! This goes for all types of damage?

Cool. Is this some sort of implant?

I can imagine a lot of interesting implants and body mods intended to
increase vacuum survivability. For instance, those who live and work in
space might have modified skin, or an implanted subcutaneous layer, which
acts like the pressure garment in a VacSuit, to limit ebullism.

To what does "Description will say VacSuit" refer?

RE: the Task List, posted previously: I still think you should change
"Craftsman" to "Handicraft" or "Shopcraft" or "Fabrication" or some such
gender-neutral term. And "Sophontology" should be added to the Social
Sciences cluster.

Marc, these preview glimpses of the Deluxe T4.1 always provide a thrill of
anticipation. Can\'t wait to see the finished product. Oops, I mean, we
*can* wait, as long as it takes - if it means it\'s going to be done right.
Looks very good so far.

That\'s not particularly true for rockets - double the thrust of a rocket
and you only double the fuel consumption. (Since, to first order,
you can double the thrust by strapping two identical rockets together.)

This is what I got when I tried it:

IIRC, someone said this was a fairly common error code.  Newbie wants to
know why.  And is there anything I can do about it?  If I try again later
might it be there?

Presuming he has some protections from things _other_ than the lack of
air, time to clinical death will be the same as for any case of
asphyxiation or drowning, somewhere on the order of 5-10 minutes before
irreversable brain damage is done. Presuming someone notices them and gets
them in to sickbay and oxygenated before the time is up they should live.
If they get really cold, that should help...people (kids mostly) who have
drowned under frigid conditions have gone without breathing for as long as
an hour IIRC, without permanent damage.

Being consious and able to help themself will definitely depend on
training, and vary from < 30 sec to > 2 minutes, depending on if they\'ve
had time to prepare (hyperoxygenate), are trained (don\'t panic, primarily)
and don\'t find themselves in a bad SF movie (In which case they explode
messily).

The list has gone over the other aspects of vaccuum exposure, damage to
the corneas, eardrums, possibly some drying of the lungs, capillary damage
of the skin, but nothing serious. There are medical case studies of
exposure to vaccuum; someone posted a link the last time this came up on
the list, I think it was also in the alt.space faqs?

	I dont have CT, but here is a comparision :

	MT : Survive low berth : routine, medical, edu, fateful
	TNE:                     difficult, medical, edu, fateful
	T4 :                     9- (10- if medical assisted)

	So low berth are ok in MT, and risky in TNE and T4. (MT routine!=
	TNE routine), but while its only posible to have a mishap up to
	3D in MT&TNE, T4 low berth are insane as they kill !

	Did CT low berth also always kill, or was did it damage, which
	can be healed, as the doctor is already there.

The actual reference is:

http://www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/Shadows.html

Rob forgot the capitalization of the Shadows.html

Yes it is probably _the_ most common error code, and is usually due to
either a typo in the URL, the site\'s been rearranged, and the path is
wrong, or it\'s gone.

Check out the results of using an airframe.  You\'ll see that at least some
runways are still going to be a good idea to accommodate such space craft
(which shouldn\'t be too uncommon).  Your last comment is particularly
pertinent.  You need somewhere for the local AirTransCo common carriers to
land their planes to unload cargo for off-planet shipment.

Notice the corrections to my original portions.  These might help clarify my
position.  Having said that, I can\'t fault any of Harold\'s points, aside
from the necessity of using Superdense armor.  Have you noticed how many new
cars have steel outside rather than some of the newer (higher tech)
materials available.  Why?  Economy, that\'s why.  But otherwise he has no
argument from me.

No, I just push down until I slid in.  I can exert sufficient strength to
make the small dimple deeper than the one holding my (unfortuanaly rather
large) butt.

I won\'t argue about the first part, but I\'m not going to pull in my arm
while maintaining the dimple.  Once I slid into it, I won\'t need to keep
holding down.

I\'d appreciate it if someone could write them.

In the interest of inclusiveness, the Imperial Edict originally
calling for the creation of the Anthem and the March also
specified that it should be scored in such a manner that it could
be reasonably performed by an ensemble equipped with a range of
musical instruments that could be designed and produced at TL3.

Chelsea Quinn Yarbro did a nice short story based on this idea, ISTR.
Protagonist was a young steward aboard a huge FTL passenger liner; sorta

Leaving aside the assumption that the politicians and ambassadors in
question will be more interested in "their" (whose, exactly?)
civilization\'s long-term durability than in the opportunity to turn the
grandiosity of the moment to their personal advantage, I think you may be
overstating the Vilani approach to interstellar government.  Vilani and
Vargr suggests that the "strong-arm" approach to incorporating clients
stopped c.-4045 at the end of the last Consolidation War (a good 1600 years
before Terran contact), and also explictly states that before the
Consolidation Wars, the Vilani expansion had taken place through
non-forceful means -- establishment of a trade community, followed by slow
exposure to Vilani civilization and gradual, eventual cultural
assimilation.  There\'s no mention in V&V of _Ziru Sirka_ engaging in
genocide or ruling with an iron fist, or even of forcibly imposing their
cultural standards.

No; there\'s no intent to break canon in this manner, and the comments in
FF&S2 shouldn\'t be interpreted that way.  However, the text should be
considerably more clear on this point.

A FF&S2 "sickbay" is one of several different types of medical facility.
They are lumped together for convenience (3 dtons, and cost 0.8MCr).  The 
sickbay supports a staff of two, at least one of whom would normally be a 
Medic-3 or better (doctor, surgeon, or medical specialist) to get the full
benefit of the facility.  The designer determines the exact purpose of the 
sickbay (outpatient care, medical specialty treatment center, critical care, 
surgery, nurse\'s station, etc.) when it is designed and installed.  Some
facilities may have multiple installations, so that (for example) you could
equip a hospital ship with an emergency room, surgery, pharmacy, trauma
unit, critical care unit, radiology department, medical lab, and so on.

My thinking about low berths and sickbays is that low berths already 
have the required equipment, drugs, and other supplies for reviving the
occupant as safely as possible - thus, the presence of a sickbay won\'t affect
the low berth survival roll, since there\'s nothing the sickbay can supply
that\'s not already available.  However if a sickbay is present, someone who 
has failed their revival roll could be transferred there, and sickbay care 
may help the patient recover  from the results of a failed roll (since the
sickbay is probably qualifies as a TL-11 or better medical facility).  This 
is unlikey to be practical, except in the case of a Naval frozen watch.

A sickbay, like the other labs and shops, provides specialized equipment,
tools, information, and other needed supplies to excercise certain skills.
For tasks where the availability of this stuff makes a difference, there
should be some type of reduction in the difficulty of a task, based on 
the availability of this equipment.  The "game effects" listed for each
type of facility gives the referee some guidelines on what this might be.
The presence of the facility won\'t help tasks that aren\'t affected by
the availability of appropriate equipment.

Agreed.  As I stated above, there was no intent to break Traveller canon
(in fact, preserving Traveller canon was an important goal with the FF&S2
work Dave and I did).  The point should have been made more clear in the 
text, and you have my apology for the way it appears now.

That is why I use both as Attributes:  Agility for balance, nimbleness and
sure-footedness; Dexterity for hand-eye coordination, fine motor control,
and sure-fingeredness.

Ok, I know Marc is going to expand the number of Characteristics, but
*personally* I use:

 Strength
 Constitution
 Agility
 Dexterity
 Intelligence
 Scholarship
 Charisma
 Will

Social Standing and Education drop from Characteristics to part of the PC\'s
background.

On the gun skill issue, I\'d say Dexterity to aim the gun, and a minimum
Strength to control the weapon without a -DM, but, of course, I always do
things differently.  ;->

Okay, that\'s still reactionless, though.  It\'s an interesting analogy.
If you created the deeper dimple ahead of you and lowered your ship
down into it that would be thrust.

The above is the best analogy for a reactionless drive I\'ve ever seen.
I\'d love for someone to back that up from the analogy and make up
some technobabble for it... maybe even something plausible.

I\'ve been messing around with the same.  First off, let me say that the
design is excellent.  Andrew clearly spent a considerable amount of time on
it.

> Here are the parameters for my design - I don\'t claim that these are
>good choices for starting up a colony, I\'ve done little or no research on

Lets look them over.  I\'ve done a little more, but it is still in the
infancy stage.  My main intent is to determine the number of people that
need to be taken to the colony world, and what do they need to take with
them to be successful, then build the ship to get them there.  I\'m assuming
that an interferometer optical telescope has discovered that there is a
habitable world orbiting another nearby system (say Tau Ceti) and the
decision is made to send a colony. 

>
>* 1000 Colonists

Not bad.  But one of the problems I toyed with was: would a thousand be
enough to establish a viable colony?  Given that the cost of such an
endeavor would be formidable (at least by modern standards), I would try to
maximize the number of people that would eventualy reach the ground.  Since
all of the colonists would have to be put into low berths, most of the
considerations for keeping them alive for the journey are eliminated, where
the remaining consideration is power.  So, how many colonists would be
optimum?  

My guess would be 10000 , but I am biased since that is the number of
people I wanted for my colony to begin with.  Clearly, 100000 is too many
and 100 is too few.  What says the list-folk?

Another consideration is the breakdown of the complement of colonists. 
Idealy, the colonists should represent a cross section of the society as a
whole--mainly to avoid problems trying to set up a new social structure. 
However, to insure genetic viability (chances are that this will be a
one-shot mission to create the colony) a disproportunate number of women in
their child bearing years would be included--including millions eggs,
sperm, and embrios representing a large cross section of the home-world
population.   Also, the number of children that are part of the original
colony should be carefuly considered.  I know that the number should not be
zero, since it breaks up the child raising chain of events.  But, the
number should not be very large because the initial events of colonization
are extreamly labor intensive, where a lot of kids would be a possible
distraction.
Furthermore, the professions of the colonists should be considered
carefuly.  Too few farmers could be as disasterous as too many.  Plus,
there has to be plenty of scientists capable of sourting out the many
surprises that will certainly be found on the new world.  Lastly, there
will have to be pilots to run the shuttle service between the starship and
the ground once they arrive at the new world.


Clearly, this is getting to be  quite a bit longer than I first thought. 
So I will stop at this point, leaving the part about what is needed in
terms of cargo for the next post, which I\'ll try to write after the
SuperBowl.  I\'d like to complement Andrew on a good design once again.

I noticed that no one mentioned that the Traveller Thrusters are some form
of Space Drive based on the Zero Point Field?  Specifically the Zero-Point
Field-Inertial concept as proposed by Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff.

More information at he following site:

This stuff is really speculative, and I can\'t admit to understanding all of
it.  But it beat any kind of handwaving explaination.  And there\'s always
NASA to give you more background information when you need it.

Jerry Pournelle (the SF writer) claims to have been exposed to vacuum during
his work with NASA (along with a few other people, some by accident, some
voluntarily). He does not indicate if this was a partial or complete vacuum,
but he does indicate some other details.

He indicates that you won\'t have to worry about holding your breath, as the
process hurts like _H*ll_ and the victim will probably be screaming in agony
very early in the exposure. 

Otherwise, he pretty much agrees with the quoted data, except that he claims
the upper limits of consciosness are longer.

I can\'t say which is best, but I rather like them. It\'s also 
surprisingly useful to read them in some sort of order, even though 
there is very little carry-over between books, if only so that what 
little plot development there is can actually be seen.

platform is going to be a DOS/Win95 machine; graphics would be preferred
(640x480x16bit ideally -- that\'s the best my current monitor can handle).

I am working on a revision of some software that I adapted/modified a year
ago that generates solar systems (Accrete 2 & 3 at Douglas Berry\'s home
page (http://www.hooked.net/~dberry)).  The features I\'m going to include are:

* Ability to build a solar system from scratch (user provides the star type
or stellar mass & luminosity).

* Ability to build a solar system around a mainworld (user provides a UWP,
the software builds a solar system and places the mainworld in the
habitable zone).

* Ability to build a solar system around basic system details (user
provides UWP (optionally) and the number of gas giants and planetoid belts
desired).

* System editing (Don\'t like having that world where it is? Move it out a
few million km!  Is the main world too big?  Resize it.  The software will
recompute the relevant planetary characteristics).

* System viewing (graphical display of the solar system -- showing relative
distances of the worlds from the star).

* Detailed world information (radius in km, axial tilt, surface
acceleration (gravity), minimum molecular weight retained, min/max
temperatures on the different latitude bands (from the MT WBH/TNE WBH).

Some other features I\'m kicking around as possible additions:
* Colonization-related information (WBH/WTH basic details -- weather
factors, seismic stress factor).

* Crude world mapping & display (a cylindrical map roughly similar to the
world maps in WBH/WTH).

* World resource information (something like the WTH has -- mineral
richness, agricultural richness, biological compatibility, etc).

I\'d like to take the system generator and use it as part of a "system
colonization" game roughly based on the economic model presented in the
WTH.  That part of the project will have to wait a while, though.

What other features would be needed to make the system generator software
package useful?  Does anyone think something like this would be useful?
I\'d really like some feedback (either directly to me or to the list) so
that I can convince my professors that there is demand for software.

  The Zhdits (the ship you are describing) originates in FASAs
Adventure Class Ships Vol 1, where it is classed as a "Close Structure".

  Yeah right.

  The Zhdits also appeared (many years later) in the Brilliant Lances
box. There it is described as a "Needle SL". I consider this much
more appropriate.

  Deckplans (bad ones) appeared in the FASA product...

  As for Zhodani ships in general, the Keith brothers are responsible
for setting the general appearance throughout a number of FASA and
GDW products for Classic Traveller.  As far as I can tell, they all
follow a set of architectural tendencies:

 -two M-Drive outlets, usually set at or below the visual midline
  of the hull and never as the aft-most parts of the ship.
 -as mentioned above, most have a "tail" or some other part of the
  ship aside from the drives that forms the actual stern.
 -wider across the lower portion of the hull than across the upper
  portions. The Zhdits shows this admirably, as the upper deck is
  long and skinny while the lower decks get progressively wider.
 -many hulls show a "necked" effect, being narrower somewhere in the
  middle than at either end. The Zhdits does this, but only the bridge
  is forward of the neck.
 -a forward-placed bridge. Among published designs only the SDB does
  not have this feature.
 -some fighters show a split cockpit glass design reminiscent of the
  helmets of Zhodani Combat Armor.
 -exterior hull appearance takes one of two (maybe three) "looks".
  Either a sweeping, organic look predominates (the Zhdits, the Ninz,
  and the Stedlas-carried Heavy Fighter) or a blocky appearance (the
  Vlezhdatl). Several ships meld these ideas into the "sharp and
  spikey" look seen on the Chatl, the Fanzhienz, and the Stedlas SDB.
  I assume that the blocky look predominates in the larger ships,
  while the organic themes are found among the smaller designs.
 -found mostly on the organics, the Zhodani favor a forward-swept
  dorsal fin on the aft half of the hull. Some also add distinct wings,
  though I have not seen a design that had _just_ wings without the
  tailfin. It was a design of this sort that caused a revolution in
  Vargr ship architecture around the time that the Rule of Man fell.
 -Overall the Zhodani prefer complex hull shapes over simple ones.
  The Imperial-favored flying wedgie is unseen in Consular space.
 -The Zhodani show no signs of using bilaterally asymetric hullforms.

 One conclusion I\'ve drawn from the pictured Zhodani designs is that
the seas of Zhdant are probably home to some _very_ interesting
life. Fast, streamlined, carnivorous cephalopods anyone?

  One set of canon pictures that I consider apocryphal (or at least
ancient history) is the illustrations on the starships page of the
original Zhodani Alien Module. While these long, slim needles may
have been needed in the strictly aerodynamic days of Zhodani space
exploration, they would have been replaced by the more aesthetic
forms in use today as contragrav negated the need for strict
aerodynamic forms.

  Deckplans exist for most of the better-known Zhodani ships, though
they all date from the FASA days, when "art" dominated and accuracy
of deckplans was worse than secondary. I\'ve also done the 200-ton
Courier from the Zhodani Alien Module and tinkered with a Free Trader
design. The Council Cruiser is a project for "someday".

I know I could get a free web page.  My own IP includes includes a
"free" page in their basic service.  I also know that their are "easy"
to use ways to create pages.  I do not know how to use them.  I am not
sufficiently motivated to learn how to use them, as I do not think that
the work is worth the effort (to me).  Doing your own web page is (IMHO)
sort of a "vanity press" type thing [This is _not_ meant to disparage
anyone out there, or any Traveller web pagesout there, it is just that
when you publish something yourself it is harder to get the validation
that you can get when someone else is willing to publish it for you.] 
While I am not unvain I am not willing to go to the effort of learning a
new program just to put the Darmine stuff up.  If someone else is
willing to put it up this will 1) save me the effort and 2) convince me
that someone else thinks it is worth doing.

Ah, but fitness doesn\'t come into it.  In T4.1, vacuum does damage to
intelligence.  You\'re just really smart...

One factor to consider is panic.  I\'d expect that when you hold your breath
for a few minutes, you\'re sitting down calmly.  Your body will be running at
its rest metabolic rate of about 80 watts.  If you\'re in a vac suit that\'s
just explosively decompressed, you\'re probably not too calm.  That will
increase your rate of oxygen consumption.  I know that cave divers have to
remain very calm at depth.  A sudden surprise or gasp will use up their air
margin.  Perhapse this is why INT is used instead of END for vacuum damage
in T4.1?

The recent discussion on sickbays and low berths have made me reconsider
the KKM missile, high energy weapons on spacecraft, and other past canon
that has been set aside because of our "real world" knowledge of the
subject matter.

I have to stand by by *feeling* that rules for KKM missiles, HE weapons,
and such need to be made, simply because they are canon. Even if some
sort of handwave is necessary, the fact remains that a great deal of
previous material use these items, and some of us (myself included) are
playing campaigns that span a decade (or more). One of the biggest
referee problems I had with TNE and then T4 was the fact that a great
number of my starship designs were invalidated overnight - sure, I could
continue to use the old rules, but I WANTED to use the new stuff, \'cause
in a lot of ways its better.

Its like the HEPlaR and Thruster argument - some people just don\'t like
thrusters. Fine - use HEPlaR. Some people are going to say (and they may
be right) that KKMs and/or HE weapons are unrealistic and scientifically
unsound. Fine - don\'t use them. But for those of us that for one reason
or another are tied to older campaigns, the disapearance of these items
(which ARE canon) is a source of small aggrevation.

I would ask that rules for these items be added back to the Traveller
rules - perhaps with a sidebar explaining that they are more "Fiction"
than "Science" (you could also toss Thrusters in this sidebar). Thus, us
old-timers that want \'em back would be happy - and newer players would
know that they are sliding away from "hard sci-fi" if they use them.

Its much easier to add such rules (to restore canon) and then ignore
them if you wish - than to not have the rules at all and ignore previous
versions of the Traveller universe.

Just my $.02

through these fields, the fields associated with your own
particles become phase shifted relative to the fields of the
virtual particles.  This phase shift induces a release of 
radiation that is opposite the direction of acceleration.
This radiation creates a measurable force known as
inertia.

    By applying the correct type of electromagnetic field
to an object, say a thrust plate, for inducing a phase shift
without accelerating, you can cause an object to accelerate.
This is kind of like reverse inertia.  So the plate doesn\'t 
create a warp in space-time to propel the ship, it just uses
the vacuum flux to create reverse inertia.

[snipped his details and my response]
 =20
From the lack of negative response, I assume that no one has=20
any problems with the description of Artificial Gravity (AG).

If this description is correct, then we need to change the way=20
we calculate acceleration on vehicles with AG.  I propose the=20
following system as an optional (gearhead) rule.
- ----=
- ----
If DA<=3DK then RT=3DDA*M3+(K-DA)*M1 and DF=3DK-DA
If DA>K and DA<(MF+K) then RT=3DM3*K + (DA-K)*M1
                                             and DF=3DDA-K
If DA>=3D(MF+K) then RT=3DMF*M1 + M3*(DA-MF) and DF=3DMF

In our final case, K is invalid, the apparent acceleration (AA)=20
will be:  AA=3DDA-MF.

One last equation:  MA=3D(TT + MF*M2)/M3

Where:
MF=3Dmaximum field strength of AG (in G\'s)
DF=3Ddesired field strength of AG (in G\'s)
M1=3Dmass of uncompensated elements (in tons)
               (probably just the hull)
M2=3Dmass of compensated elements (in tons)
M3=3Dtotal mass (M1+M2) (in tons)
TT=3Dtotal thrust that can be developed by the engines (in tonGs)=20
RT=3Drequired thrust (in tonGs) to achieve the DA
DA=3Ddesired acceleration possible (in G\'s)=20
MA=3Dmaximum acceleration possible (in G\'s)
K=3Dconstant apparent acceleration (in G\'s)
     (probably 1 but could be anything according to the desires
     of (or orders to) the programmer of the computer that
     controls/adjusts the AG)

PS:  If your engines were off-line but the AG still worked you=20
could get an acceleration of up to MF*M2/M3 (in G\'s).  But,
it would feel like free fall.

Of course the beer and pretzels crowd could continue to=20
calculate their accelerations in the normal manner.

Well, what do you think?
- ----=
- ----
After finishing the above write-up, I thought of something else:

Why don\'t we avoid the whole T-Plate debate and just include=20
the deck plates within the field?  Then we could accelerate=20
everything at whatever the field strength is.

Of course then everyone and everything inside would be in=20
zero-g (relatively speaking).  But then I guess we could add a=20
1 G engine or stack another field inside the first (between the=20
deck plates).

	depends on what you call viable. imho 1000 people without trade
	will be TL:3 in some generations. In what I understand about
	macro economics, the diversity increases with techlevel, and only
	a large economy can build the synergy to sustain a high techlevel
	for a prolonged time. Building colonies in sailing ship era, was
	easy, the colony had trade and the techlevel they started was not
	significant higher than their population code. But to start a TL:9
	colony you have to howl 10^9/2^4 people. I think most solomani
	islanders had been in renessaince when recontacted.

	yes it is, but writing in TML is also "vanity press".

	The learning curve of HTML is easy, if you managed to write plain

	into HTML is most times, only adding <p> for paragraph break. And
	<h1>header</h1> for headings. With only 5 tags (P,H,A,UL,LI) you
	can have your plain text documents HTML viewable.

	send your writings to "Freelance Traveller" they are hosting other

The equipment card for a Mark 17 Mod 3 Personal Environment Suit may not

No. Its a descriptive phrase for equipment. It would be included in a

Yes. So a 2D hit range from minimum 2 (-5=0) to 12 (+5=17), but the typical

I agree with Michael, Peter -- put it up on Freelance Traveller!  It\'s the
closest thing to a JTAS we have right now.

I think there has to be a good system to handle explosives (and nukes).
Frankly, I think of most Artillery and Bombs as \'Battlefield Events." Players
don\'t use them; enemy doesn\'t direct them against just a band of adventurers.
They are instead events that happen.

Nevertheless there should be explosive effects rules (which I am writing) as
part of the Personal Combat system. That should be expanded to the Space
Combat system when I write that.

Try "holding your breath" with no air in your lungs. 

Actually trying to keep air in your lungs is a sure-fire way to damage
yourself in a decompression situation.  IIRC, the correct technique is
hyperventilate for a while to increase your blood oxygen, then empty your
lungs, then depressurize.  Keep your eyes closed (so they aren\'t damaged
by freezing).

Strength does play into the aiming of a rifle, IMO.  You have to be able to
hold a weapon VERY steady to hit a target, esp as the range increases.  This
can get difficult for some people (me, personally, trying to hold a 12.5# M-1
Garand on a target much beyond 300 yards would be ludicrous.)

Having said that, I believe Dexterity also should play into the equation also.
I look at things like this:  Once the round (of any type) is fired, it will go
where it was aimed (barring any outside effects).  So the final firing
solution is the key to hitting the target (This is ESP true for lasers; you
can\'t evade a laser beam on a personal scale)

My take is that for quick shots, Dex would be the default skill.  For aimed
fire, or longer-ranged shots, Strength would be the one to go with.

Actually, someone has written the Imperial Anthem.  IIRC, it\'s set to the
Jupiter theme from Holst\'s The Planets.

I\'m afraid I don\'t have the words (although I\'d like them) - that file
disappeared during one of many system crashes* last year.

I wrote one for the Macintosh (Metator) and Dave Burden did one for the
Atari, but I don\'t think anyone\'s done one for the PC yet.  I can tell you
that there _is_ a lot of pent-up demand, judging by my email :-)

If you decide to do this, I suggest that we collaborate wrt file format
and menu structure (especially file format).  That was things look like a
single package, everyone can share data.

I have access to CodeWarrior for both PC and Mac, so if you are using that
development environment we can swap code, do a cross-compile, etc.

Metator does everything you plan on doing, plus more.  We should probably
discuss the details by private email, though.

You didn\'t learn it all in 3 hours.  All that time you spent learning how
BASIC worked and whatever other programming languages and applications you
may know how to use were part of the process.  With your background, it was
easy.  For others it may take as long or longer than it took you to learn

Why would the ship be left in orbit. Surely it would be landed and cannibalised 
for the resources it represents ( particularly the computer tech and 
generators). It would be much more convenient to have it on the ground than 
floating two or three hundred miles overhead.

I\'d normally say the same thing, but for display images, all it
means is that the image will be giant (at 72-96 dpi on the screen).

I have the National Geographic CD set, and I think it\'s nearly
useless, even with a 20 inch monitor.  That CD set requires that you
either view pages too small to read, or at the resolution of the
pages (which are just images). That means that the probably 150 dpi
images make the magazine twice its normal size onscreen. As a result
you have to scroll around a single page even on my monitor. Yuck :-)

I\'d design the display pages to look nice on an average screen.
Maybe one page wide takes up ~600 pixels, then scroll down that
page, then click to the next, and so forth. You can add justo-recto
pages for people with big monitors. Just my Cr0.02.

Single radio channel maximum transmission rate is 2, for every 5 radio
channels dedicated to data transmission increase the rate by 1.

Tight beam communications such as laser and maser have a single channel
transmission rate of 3, for every 2 channels dedicated to data transmission
increase the rate by 1.

Fiber optic data transmission rate is equal to the highest computer rating
of the computers tech level.

For things like photographs, .JPGs are fine, but for line drawings or picture 
with large blocks of colour, .GIFs are usually better. No single format is 
perfect for all cases.

    'body' => 'Ok, to jump in a bit on this subject, I\'ve also done a bit of thinking on
this, form the point of veiw that this is how the homeworld/colony of my
campaign started and I\'ve begun to try and write a cohesive history. In part
I believe that this depends on the era and the world launching the colony
ship,

In my campaign the colony was one of several secret colonies launched at
random from Terra, when the threat of Vilani conquest was still a major
factor. In my scenario the colony ships were sub-light, since they were
intended to travel large distances from Sol, to hide them better, and the
Jump 1 drive would have been to inefficient, so speed was lost for distance.

Anyway, at this time it was already established that Terra is higher in
biological sciences than the First Imp., and extrapolateing a bit from
current science I picture the ship being about 90% robotic controled, witha
very small mainenence crew in low berths. THe remaining "living" colonists
consist of frozen genetic material, several 10\'s of thousands of donors
contributing.

The ship also carries robotic construction equipment. Once a suitable world
is found the cargo space emptied while the robotic constructor begin laying
the foundation of the colony infrastructure. In the empty holds artifical
wombs are set up in the cleared space and genetic matrial is started to
grow. The small crew continue to use cold sleep to "hop" forward and monitor
the growth of their colonists, and of the computer controlled subliminal
traing. When a batch is "finished" it\'s released, again supervised for a
period by a teacher, and another batch is started.

Mix in normal population growth factors and you have a fairly large gene
pool with new introduction every 17-18 years to keep it viable. Also the
cryogenic "teachers" appearing at regular intervals should aid in
stabilizing the society, (remember these are colonies intended to insure the
continuence of the Terran race and culture). After several generations,
about the time the teachers run out of extended life, a viable colony should
exist.

This also leads to some neat variations. In one scenario I can envision the
"First Born" or even the original crew, setting them selves up as dictators,
dispite being chosen phycologically to avoid this. It could even lead to a
relegion with the "Return of the Teachers" at it\'s heart.

Well, just my slant on how this could work,

This comes from the HPR theory, doesn\'t it?  ;->  

It\'s not really "reverse inertia", though, they are adamant about there
being no negative mass of any kind..neither gravitational or inertial mass
can be negative.  

Anyway, from my reading of their theories, they seem to say you *might* be
able to *cancel* some or all of the inertia caused by accelerating a parton
through the ZPF. This would give us Grav-Compensators. BTW, they say a
perfered inertial frame is possible, but a perfered gravitational frame is
not.

It also looks like they think you might be able to induce an inertial
effect directly with an EM field. Because inertia is caused by interactions
within the ZPF from secondary fields created by accelerating partons if you
induced the *effect* directly the parton would have to accelerate. Thus you
would get acceleration without expending reaction mass.  

IAC, the same theory that connects inertia (and inertial mass) to EM also
connects gravity (and gravitational mass) to EM, so, we can handle CG the
same way. It appears to me that blocking gravitation effect might be
possible, but I don\'t think you could produce thrust with gravity.

Folks, there is an interesting article on io.com in the GURPS file section
on reactionless thrusters written by MA Lloyd. I don\'t have an exact URL,
but if you look you can find it. I guess coming up with a handwave is
something we *all* have a problem with. ;->

OK, we\'ve had several suggested handwaves for how Thrusters could work.
What I want to know is what are the *side effects* from each method?  If we
induce gravity at distance, what does that do to repluser/presser
technology? If we block or induce inertia what effect does that have on
power production? If we apply EM to produce thrust directly at over unity,
then are we creating unlimited power production? If we induce inertial
thrust, or block inertial force, then what happens to the system\'s momentum
when we turn the drive off?

Uh, guys?

Holding your breath with a 1 atmosphere (positive) pressure
differential between your lungs and the outside of your body. is
*guaranteed* to cause major lung damage and the bends, if not just
plain air embolisms due to ruptured alevioli(sp). Oh yeah, you\'ll also
rupture both eardrums.

It\'s no different than a scuba diver holding his breath while making a
quick ascent from 10 meters. The results are *not* pretty or pleasant.

Marc\'s figures are *correct*. They are based on NASA and USAF research
on chimps as well as a couple of accidents (on the ground) that left
humans exposed to vacuum.

I suggest that Marc revise the rules on Vacuum exposure to explicitly
state that one should *not* attempt to hold one\'s breath, and to give
some fairly serious damage if someone tries. 

In fact, it might be an idea to incorporate an couple of paragraphs
thast are supposedly an excerpt from an "in case of emergency"
pamphlet. I\'d be willing to try writing such a thing, though I\'m sure
that others will have lots of input.

- ----
Tukera Lines Emergency Procedures pamphlet, (c) 1 Imperial.
Section 7, Loss of Pressure emergency:

While loss of pressure is extrememly unlikely, it pays to be prepared. 
If the pressure alarm goes off, the rescue ball storage units will open
automatically. Your steward will have shown you how to use one, and
instructions are on the door as well. 

<skip instructions on rescue ball use>

If the area of the ship you are in loses pressure before you can get to
a rescue ball, do *not* attempt to hold your breath. The pressure
difference between your lungs and the vacuum can cause serious damage.
Instead, open your mouth *wide* and try to yawn. This will help open
the air passages to your ears and prevent damage to them. 

Vacuum can cause moderate damage to eyes through excessive drying and
freezing of evaporating fluids. Close your eyes and open them for brief
"blinks". Persistence of vision will let you navigate quite well and
still protect the delicate tissues. You might want to practice this
now. Close your eyes and try to move around your cabin while blinking
them open once or twice a second. 

If you are in a portion of the ship that loses pressure, you\'ll have
30-40 seconds to get to pressure before you start to lose conciousness.
Don\'t worry. 30 seconds is a *lot* of time. Just remain calm and follow
the instructions above and you\'ll be fine. And you\'ll have quite a
story for your friends when you return home.
- ----

Well, anyone have any additions or changes to make?

BTW, it occurs to me that a pamphlet such as a spaceline might hand out
to passengers would be a *neat* thing to throw together. Sort of like
the ones airlines put in seatbacks or (I assume) cruise ships put in
stateroooms. 

Either include it with the rules, use it as a promo item, or come up
with some other "background" goodies of the same sort and sell them as
a package (sort of like the "Miskatonic Matriculation Module" for
CofC).

You learn to program (normally) only once, and it\'s generally not easy.
You learn language syntaxes every time you encounter a new language, and it
can (depending on the language) get quite easy...

This would be most useful. But the feature that would make it even better
would be the ability to import sector uwp data. So that you can use it in
conjunction with the Third Imperium and not have to start from scratch. If
you could import the basic uwp data and then have the program do all the
detailing it would be perfect.

Just my 2 cents.

Treat it as two hulls. One for the oblong, one for the neck.

This approach will even let you design such silliness as the NCC-1701

Actually, GW may *not* hold the copyright. It depends on both the
wording of their "standard contract" and on any special terms the
author may have gotten. 

What gaming magazines *should* be asking for is "serial rights" (ie,
they are the only magazine that can publish it), plus some reprint
rights (so they don\'t have to track down the author to include the
article in a "best of" compilation). They may additionally want some
derivative rights (so that if they like the idea, they can put a
modified form in the rules or future articles), but also allow the
*author* derivative rights.

Note that I say *should*, above. That\'s because what I list allows the
author to do various things that are reasonable, but also allows the
magazine to make reasonable use of the article. 

Relity is rather different. From what I hear, most gaming mags buy
*all* the rights. Which means that the author essentially has no say in
what they do with it, and can\'t use it himself! 

In that latter case, *only* GW can give you permission.

But if you *don\'t* pull in your arm, you\'ll not be *able* to slide in.
Instead you\'d have your hand in the dimple, and your arm *holding*
you away from sliding in.

Since to make a "deeper" dimple, you are effectively transferring your
ships mass to the dimple, and since this "drive" results in *no* change
in your momentum (at the beginning and end you still have the same
momentum) what you\'ve got is stutterwarp!

But that doesn\'t *double the acceleration*. And it\'s *that* that uses 4

This probably understates the advantage of laser over radio - in space,
with sufficient power, laser data rates should be comparable to fibre
optics (="Really, Really High".) To be honest, getting things like this right
for extrapolated technology is so hard that I\'m almost happier to leave it
fuzzy - though it pains my gearhead heart - unless a trained professional
with lots of experience in fibreoptics and (hypothetical) laser commo
takes it on.

	I\'m playing with the idea of a CTrAN (Comprehensive Traveller
	Archive Network) for improving coordination of web publishing
	comunity. CTrAN should give us the same that CPAN is for Perl,
	and CTAN for TeX. A virtual network (traveller.org ;-) on which
	authors can participate, which is flood filled to the sites.
	Whenever a user connects to CTrAN a traceroute will try to find
	his position and forward him to the next CTrAN mirror. Like CPAN
	its also posible to mirror at home, so members allways have an
	actual and comprehensive "canon" at their fingertips.

	So my questions (please reply directly - I\'ll post the summary !-)

	Who would like the idea :
	- to have a mirror at home
	- to have a mirror at his providers homepage

	Who is able :
	- to install cgi/perl at home
	- to install cgi/perl at his providers homepage

	What is your Operating System :

	OS that would have large problems (no network, no browser)
	- DOS (Intel 8088-80268)
	- TOS (Atari)
	- DOS (Amiga)

	OS that have some problems (network, file conventions)
	- Mint (Atari)
	- MacOS (Mac 68K)
	- MacOS (Mac PPC)
	- WinDows (Intel)
	- NT (Intel)

	OS that have few porting problems
	- Unix/Linux/BSD (independent of processor)
	- Mach (Mac)
	- Rhapsody (Mac)

	Is HotJava or NetScape available at your home platform ?
	Is your provider allowing CGI ?
	Is your provider using a unix look like system ?

	And last not least. Do you think that you are "guru" on your
	OS, to become alpha tester (no unlike Linux this wont become
	sponsored by DEC) and help other people sharing your platform
	with their installation problems ?

The very first language I learned was HTML.  No BASIC, no nothing (with
Craig around, who needed to learn?)  It took me about two hours to grasp
the basics of writing HTML, and a few weeks of practise to become competent
with it.

It\'s *not* multiplexing. And we are getting 33.6k *bps* over a 2400
baud link. In short, it\'s just the way we modulate. The real limits are
set by Shannon\'s law, which works in bps.

It\'s actually a lot "simpler". Max bps is determined by bandwidth. And
for a given signal to noise ratio, doubling the bandwidth, doubles the
bps. 

So for a channel X hertz wide, you can send Y bps. make it 2X wide, and
you can send 2Y bps.

	Shannon\'s Law:

	C= W log2( 1 + S/N )

	C = throughput in bits per second
	W = bandwidth in hertz
	S/N = signal to noise ratio

Because designing it to be *able* to land is both very difficult, and
adds a *lot* of mass, both for fuel and for engines and bracing.
Remember, we are alraeady talking about something the size of a small
city. 

It\'s still possible to cannibalize most of the ship if you use
shuttles. And the part left in orbit can be useful for weather
observation as well as other forms of satellite recon.

I agree about leaving it fuzzy. so lets increase it to single channel
transmission rate of 4. for every 2 channels dedicated to data transmission
increase the rate by 1.

For which of course you need 4 hulls.  A large disk, a larger long cylinder

You implication is that I will have to "pull" in order to slide.

OTOH, maybe I won\'t pull in my hand and I will use the force of the slide to
push it forward in a kind of continual riding the wave rather than a pulsed
movement as described earlier, now wouldn\'t that be a trick.

	Actually, even assuming you can "reach out" and cause a dimple
elsewhere in space, it won\'t do you any good. You see, if you\'ve
got two dimples, there\'s *still* a "ridge" between them. Like
this:


*                                     *
  *                                 *
    *                             *
      *                **       *
        *            *    *   *
          *        *        * 
            *    *
               *  

	So you\'ve got to completely lift yourself up and transfer your
entire weight elsewhere... which is going to be quite energy
consuming no matter how you do it.

He\'s right though, I spent hours and days teaching myself BASIC back in
the early 80\'s.  Since then I\'ve learned many different versions of
BASIC.  I think the most difficult one to work with was the C/PM based
version that came on the Hewlett Packard 120 and 125 systems.  It
utilized a very cumbersome predecessor to modern ANSI.  For instance,
clearing the screen and homing the cursor was done by sending a CTRL-J
and CTRL-H sequence.

Commodore BASIC was hands-down the easiest, with Applesoft somewhere in
between.  Right now my problem is Visual BASIC 4.0, which I have, but do
not know at all.  I\'ve seen a few examples of code but they hardly make
any sense to me.  Sometimes I\'ll see "Private Sub" and sometimes I\'ll
just see "Sub".  Anyone know any basic syntax rules for this language? 
Or any books that will teach me?

I don\'t have a color printer, so the color print
judgements are based on how they showed up in B&W.
The 90dpi versions had discernable pixel artefacts.
The higher dpis has sharper lettering and more faint
details showed up. In print and screen, the 150dpi
seemed to be the best balance between detail and size,
though I couldn\'t say whether gif or jpg were noticeably
better.    For B&W, the 16 colors are a definite no --
the grid mostly dropped out and there were a few other
minor flaws that made it look bad. The B&W 90dpi prints
had some blurring of details (like lettering). There
wasn\'t much difference between the higher dpis, so again
150 was better by dint of size, and here gif is better
due to some (very) faint "fuzz" around objects on the jpg.

    I assume you mean because of the Heplar/Thruster thing rather than KKMs? I
may well be wrong, but I see nowhere in any of my TNE stuff where it
explicitly said that kkms were unfeasable.  I learned that on this list.
There simply weren\'t any included w/ the space combat rules (generic or
Brilliant Lances).  Just make some and put them in and *pretend* that they
can\'t be counteracted w/o resorting to intricate measures like "bubba."
lol... damn that sounds funny. ; )
   Are you really saying that theres any way to keep CT and MT designed ships
valid w/ FFS1 or 2?  I never designed a ship w/ MT and have only seen a couple
of adventures w/ CT.  I presume capabilities should be evenly matched... i.e.
a 100 ton ship is gonna be a wimp any which way u look at it... a multi
thousand tonners are gonna be a helluva lot more capable of mounting numerous
weapons the size of that lil 100 ton ship, but details?  Maybe someone
talented in such matters should make a spreadsheet based on MT or HG and crack
out some ships and learn the limits?  OTOH, there are probably many people who
can already answer this.  Still, i\'d find an MT ship design spreadsheet to be
very intriguing, for comparative value alone.

This is exactly what TNE did w/ the Thruster Plates, along w/ a bunch of other
exotic M-drives.   Of course, the "old-timers" weren\'t very happy because it
wasn\'t the "official" way, but oh well.

     I don\'t really like HOW TNE went about going to all Heplar and
invalidating canon.  I do appreciate very much the WHY and agree w/ teh
reasoning.  I think Heplar is more "realistic," especially for a game that
claims to be based on Hard Science.    
     I have been becoming dangerously partial to Thruster plates in particular
and reactionless drives in general since finally acquiring a copy of the
Starship Operators Manual (before i had just tinkered w/ the idea).  I had
long decided I was going to allow reactionless drives in the purview of the
Ancients (along w/ some assorted other methods of ftl).  As it is now, i think
i\'m going to make them (thruster plates) tl 17 or 18.  
    Of course, I had a brief notion of saying that the Imperium always used
them and that all of the designs I have (TNE) are just New Era conversions of
the ships.  Imperial Ships would have much lower crews and Tplates.  Then I
thought maybe Tplates cause some kind of pollution or make people go
sociopathic and its finally been discovered.  Maybe the 3I kept it under
wraps...  But i\'ve never done anything more than brainstorm that and i\'m
straying from topic... ; )
    I\'ve also been contemplating putting lathanum hull grids back on.  In most
ships i\'ve designed, i have plenty of surface area left over and i don\'t see a
problem w/ simply adding it on and taking away a little surface area of which
theres plenty.  Of course i can always just *pretend* that every ship has it
included w/ the hull for free and give a discount for ships that don\'t.

Since the primary hull (saucer) is supposed to be a seperate vehicle from the
secondary (the 3 cylinders), maybe make 2 hull and a grapple for them.  Make
it a jettison grapple since on 1701 it was supposed to only be reattachable at
a starbase and the 1701-D a standard grapple.  
   Since the 2 smaller longer cylinders are supposed to be the warp nacelles
you don\'t have to worry bout them.  
   I guess the combo would have to be considered unstreamlined, no?  This also
gets rid of a need for escape pods since the primary hull is supposed to be
one giant escape pod.

Shadows got it right essentially.  If the author of a copyright doesn\'t own the
copyright, guess what?  That author ain\'t got no copyright.  As a general matter,
you only need the permission of the copyright owner to use a work in a way that
would infringe otherwise.

There is some difference between treatment of copyright in the US and the UK/EU
wirth regard to author\'s rights.  Generally, the former recognize that an author\'s
right of personality is somehow incorporated into his works, and he may, in some
very limited situations, prevent the owner of the copyright of a work he authored
from using the work in a way that would offend him / his creativity/ personality
etc.  These kind of provisions have usually been limited to visual arts (even the
US has recognized a limited right of the author in such works, provided that only a
lmited umber are ever produced).

Given all this (and sparing you all the many US and UK cases I\'ve read on this
subject), if you\'re in the UK, I\'d say be very, very careful.. Some judges think
that even a table of contents is protectable because it encompasses the main idea /
structure of a book.  Its very doubtful that a US judge would ever go that far
based on the law over hear (especially "fair use" law).

Actually it was printed in the Designers notes to Brilliant Lances
which was in some Challenge or another (#51?). They argued that
since non-det-laser missiles were easy to shoot down, they simply
would not exist. Kinda dumb, actually since ignoring them means that
you have no real defenses, and then you are vulnerable to the very
missiles that are "impossible" to use in practice. I always liked
\'em myself :-)

With all the physical trauma that your body would be undergoing (boiling
*and* freezing at the same time) I doubt anyone could remain conscious for
much over a minute.  The numbers I have generated lead to unconsciousness
at around 30 seconds and "death" via brain damage at 84 seconds (for an
average 777777 individual).

I guess my next question should be "Is this close enough to being accurate,
or do I have to rewrite our asphyxiation rules from scratch?"

So who wants to design the logo on the barf bag?  I suggest a green
Imperial Sunburst that resembles Mr. Yuck!

I think Craig Berry summed it up quite nicely:

"I like the use of INT as hit points.  I like the idea that dumb people

1 point per minute is a bit slow, IMHO.

I hate to say this, but I think a colony needs more people than 1,000;
10,000; or 100,000 people.  In order to get the diverse Gene-Pool we will
need & all of the skills we will need I would have to hazzard a guess at
least 500,000 to 1,000,000.  This will allow for several cities to spring
up, people will not have to increase population as fast as in a smaller
effort, tech levels will be close to as high as the homeworld.

What I think is the only bad thing in the World Creation Rules is that the
smaller your pop the higher your TL, I feel it should be the other way
around.  Thie higher your pop the higher your tech.  More Scientists equals
better tech.

Also, why do new colonies always have a low TL?  I mean if you arrive at a
Earth-like world form the homeworld with everything you need to create a
vivable colony you will have the state of the art equipment with you.  From
what I have seen in Traveller all you need to start a colony is warm
bodies.  Not true, you will need all facets of life & learning.

Although I cannot disagree with you, I am forced to wonder how mankind
sprang up from a small and non-diverse gene pool.  There must have been
a time in pre-history where there were VERY few humans.  What I\'d like
to know is how primitive man solved the small gene pool problem.  Was
there increased radiation from solar influences that created a high
mutation rate?

Thank you.  Mostly, I watched Macross 7 & got the idea from there.  In
other books & movies, colonies are started byt a small number of people,
but why do they think that a extra-solar colony will be as easy to set up
as a colony in the americas was?

Maybe it was the Ancients?  Maybe it was the Forerunners or Eldar?  Maybe
there were higher levels of solar radiation in the past?  Maybe there were
higher level of background radiation?

But, while my Traveller page is not up yet, I will give you some background
on the Forerunners.  I have always felt that only one race that was first
up & then to have only six Major races develop at about the same time just
blows, so I created the Forerunners.  Basicly they are between the Ancients
& the races of modern day in power.  About TL 25.

As for the Eldar, well think Elves in Space.  Yes, Elves in Space.  I like
Elves & I like Traveller so I put Elves in Traveller.  A TL 20 Race that is
the current elder race of the know galazy.  They have been known to medle
in human afairs for years.  They created the legends of elves on earth to
give themselves power when they meet with mankind again.  Right now the
3rd. Imp. has no knowledge that they exist, but they are molding humanity
in ways they do not know about or understand because of a coming "storm". 
As for the Vargar, Zho, & Aslan races well they are doing 

This storm will be either the return of the Forerunners or the
"Grandfather".  I have not made up my mind yet.

I think it\'ll have little effect at higher numbers of dice. But with
low numbers, I think it\'ll give a better distribution. I\'ll have to
write some quick and dirty code to see the exact curves.

I think that (remebering all that I read.. I can look it up later if

Mbps) use like 2-5% of the avaible bandwith, using current 
technology. And it is more then possible to stuff many many fibre 
strands into one cable.

While, at this time (again, realworld) lasers are topping out at 10 
Mbps...To achive anything like 100 Mbps at this time, you have to 
have a really really really clean channel... no interferance. I think 
that the properties of laser slow it up consiterably.

If you need, I can drag out my WAN manuals (I never really play with 
lasers, Fibre is really the way to go at this time, and the area that 
I do most of my work has tons of dark fibre under the streets, so 
hopping a ride under a street is not really a problem.. or you can be 
like my last contract and just buy the bloody poles to string it up 
your self!) <grin>

Actually no, that\'s the beauty of this analogy.  I don\'t need
to transfer my weight at all.  Here\'s my graphic of the 
situation:

Before:
ooooo          oooooo
           8      8
             8  8
               0

During:
ooooo                 ooooo
           8             8
             8         8
               0     8
                 8 8
                   *
After:
ooooo           oooooo
            8      8
              8  8
                0

where the "0" is my self (ship), the "*" is my hand (the 
anomaly under discussion), the "o" is the normal 
curvature of space and the "8" is the gravity well.

I don\'t know how much of a general interest this is to the list, but I for
one am also interested in learning this new (to me) programming language.
While it\'s not directly related to Traveller, it is related to the way we

Some of us Freelancers would actually prefer it if they only bought 
"First" Serial rights; which mean that they have the right to the first 
publication (but this does not then pevent me from going and selling the 
article to someone else after that (this is very common in magazines; you 
sell the article to Asimov, say, and then later include it in an 
anthology or rewwork it slightly to sell as a novel). 
 
Most have no problems with first anthology rights in a "Best of", 
although many believe that, if the company is making more money off of 
the article, we ought to get s little something more as well. Deriviative 
rights can get messy (especially if both the writer *and* the magazine 
have derivative rights) but are not unreasonable... this is the sort of 
thing that can get hashed out in negotiations.

What\'s worse, is they don\'t often pay *more* because they bought all 
rights! Most gaming magazines, if they pay anything at all, pay a 
pittance (if you get a whole penny a word, you\'re lucky... many pay a 
flat fee per "page" or per article).

In most publishing, if a company buys "all rights", they *pay* for it, 
through the bleeding nose. This is because, literally, the author has *no*
rights to an article once it is turned in (note that this does *not* 
necessarily mean that he cannot use the ideas again, or the research, but 
it had better be in a *very* different article). 

The magazine company, on the other hand, now can do *anything* they want 
with the article; they can sit on it, never letting it be published (this 
has happened, although not, to my knowledge, in the gaming industry), 
make a movie out of it, turn it into a multimedia project, whatever.

Most game companies, for the most part (and as far as I know) don\'t buy 
all rights out of malice, but merely expediency; by buying all rights, 
they can turn an article into part of the intellectual property of the 
game or magazine, allowing them to do what they want with it. It makes it 
a lot easier to allow another writer to expand on the ideas given in some 
book if they don\'t have to go back to the original author for permission. 
By making it a one time financial arrangement, they also avoid a lot of 
hassle regarding intellectual property and tracking payments; they *know* 
what the IP status of a given bit of their material is.

OTOH, not *all* companies buy all rights; Pagan Publishing (makers of 
Delta Green and other fine CoC supplements) does not, and I believe SJG 
doesn\'t *always* buy all rights, but I\'m not sure.

I have a baseline set. My main task at the moment is creating the ultimate
Classic data set. 180 sectors and counting. It will probably be released
with Galactic 2.4.
Anyway, closer to your point, I\'m also working on hooks for Galactic to

I will take the same side, for completely different reasons:

For game balance, I prefer it when the stats the skills are based upon
are spread out.  There usually aren\'t many meaningful uses for
strength in a high-tech society, and even if it\'s a thin excuse for
making firearms based on strength, it\'ll help even things out.  In my
experience, this keeps variety in the characters people like to play.

(An extreme version of this problem is GURPS, where nearly all skills
are based on dex or int.... if your character\'s highest stat is in
strength, it is largely wasted.)

I\'m not sure what you mean. Doubling the thrust (roughly) doubles
the acceleration, for a ship whose mass isn\'t dominated by the rocket
itself (which is true for almost all rocket ships in their fully-
fuelled state, since rockets have high T/W.) 

Doubling the delta-V is another matter, of course, but that\'s not a 
square relationship either.

You must be thinking lans, telecom networks are already much beyond this:

Nortel has a bit of kit that will put 10Gb/s down a pair of fibres
using a single laser frequency (it does cost more than a pc lan card though.)

I recall someone writing a paper a few years back that suggested if you
use lots of lasers at different frequencies, a single fibre pair could
shift multiple Tb/s. I can\'t remember exactly how many, but it was irrelevant
because BT would only need a single pair.

(ps, I can\'t remember if that single pair allowed for everyone using 
holographic videoconferencing instead of voice - I think it did :-)

Sort of. The basic ship designs can be passed from system to system. The
problems are the abscence of Plasma Weapons, Fusion Weapons, Particle
Accelerator Turrets (and Barbettes) and KKMs - and the high tech level of
repulsors. When you move ship designs from MT and CT to FF&S, you\'re left in
the lurch as far as these weapons are concerned. The obvious choice is -
replace KKMs with Det-Laser, and replace the other weapons with various
flavors of lasers (In fact, that\'s what Brilliant Lances appears to have
done). My problem is - THATS NOT MY TRAVELLER. Sure, new players may not
know the difference, but its rather important to me.

For example, I have a race that prefers to fight close and dirty - so their
ships are plasma/fusion heavy. While changing these to lasers may not seem
like a big deal, it looses some of that "flavor" that the race had before.

Some people have suggested that classic missiles were not necessarily KKM -
they are simply listed as "conventional" and "nuclear" - why can\'t the
"conventional" be det-laser? Because it CT, "conventional" warheads were not
affected by nuclear dampers - det-laser are.

I also don\'t think the system should be "If you want
<KKM/Fusion/Plasma/Repulsor>, just add it yourself." These items are game
canon, for better or for worse. The system should be "Here are the rules for
<KKM/Fusion/Plasma/Repulsor>, but note that these items are perhaps
scientifically unsound, and you are free to ignore these rules." The game
should be backwards compatable - even if these things are not "official" any
more.

Que put out a Visual Basic 4 tutor by Clink Hicks c/w cd show\'n\'tell.
I don\'t have VB 4.0 but I have used VB earlier versions, but I do have
the tutor. I understand that MS Access uses VB to create the d/b entry

Just found another source book I had stashed. The Waite Group Press also
had some VB how-to books with disc applications and inside back cover.
These were for earlier versions of VB but the language has not changed
all that much, if any, and they probably have some more recent books on
the market.

A lot of the sector data can be downloaded in text format from
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/ in the archive section. Also one
of the list members created a excel spreadsheet with a lot of the sector
data, and he also created an access database for it to. I\'m afraid I can\'t
find the site where I got that but somebody else on the list is sure to
remember. If there is something specific you need just ask the list and I\'m
sure somebody on it can send you it via email if its possible.

Note that material requiring a license (ie any Traveller stuff!) isn\'t
appropriate.

Not for NCC 1701 ("no bloody A, B, or C" to quote Scott).  However, for the
later models, maybe.

The first one was never intended to land.  It could, but in Traveller, any
ship can land if it has sufficient bracing.  It may be a rough ride, but,
you can get them down.

Do I dare say that perhaps God had a hand in it?  I know it\'s not very
SF\'ish to believe that an all powerful Deity might be concerned with the
well being of a small band of "primitives" but...

OTOH, perhaps it\'s a matter of reality shift.  I believe that at one time
the correct value for Pi was 3 (not 22/7ths or 3.1415926...), then one day
someone (an authority) said, "It can\'t be that simple."  And started looking
for the "correct" value for it and "found" it was closer to 22/7ths (which
was exactly what he thought it would be).  Then later still, someone else
(another authority) said, it can\'t be that simple...

I base my belief in the changing reality on the fact that many ancient
people were quite advanced in their understanding of math and could wrap a
string around a cylinder and see what the circumference was in relation to
the diameter.  There are other (even more modern) examples of this shift in
reality based on expectations of people (usually authorities).

For example, the atomic mass of hydrogen (and all the other elements) used
to be the same as their number on the periodical chart.  Someone (an
authority) decided that nature couldn\'t be so precise and start looking for
the "actual" mass and "found" that he was right, it wasn\'t exactly 1 (for
hydrogen) but 1.008.

We tend to find what we are looking for.

My limited understanding indicates that when a small gene pool exists,
minor divergences become major ones.  For example, a recessive gene that
would likely die out in a large population can become a trait of the entire
gene pool.

Inbreeding can reinforce such genes, not all of which are harmful, and it
is this which (in some circles) leads to speciation.  The stacking of
recessives makes the genetic inertia of a group low enough to be easily
altered by slight differences in environment.  For example, you are more
likely to see a dramatic mutation in a large group, but given a favorable
mutation, you are more likely to see it dominate the gene pool in a small one.

Anyone who knows this well care to comment?

Which is _exactly_ the example given in (IIRC) FFS for a \'close structure\'

Except you aren\'t \'freezing and boiling\' at the same time. The human body
is a good insulator. You\'ll be getting some superficial freezing, but
you\'re not going to radiate heat that fast. The same holds for the boiling
part. You\'ll heat up a lot faster than you wold in an atmosphere, since
there\'s no air to filter out the solar radiation, and you\'ll sunburn PDQ.

Still...84 sec is way too short a time for brain death to occur. the
standard CPR rule is at 10 _minutes_ after heartbeat cessation you can get
brain damage starting to occur, and at 20 you will get it to
occur...actual brainwave flatlining is somewhat beyond that. if the poor
sap is in shadow, IE: cold, hypothermic effects can actually extend that
time.

Me, i used to be a TOS Fan all teh way till i realized how silly alot of Star
Trek is.  I still prefer TOS to all the others.  It is implied in several
sources (model kits and books) that the original Enterprise (1701) could do
saucer seperation but it was kicked free via explosive bolts (reconnection
possible at a Starbase).  It was pretty old in theory.  Mr Scotts guide to the
Enterprise also mentioned it for the A (w/ teh ability to reconnect).  None of
this is *canon* for ST, though.  The 1701-D is simply the first to make use of
it, but the concept is TOS.

PA turrets and Barbettes are just plain ridiculous to me.  Plasma and fusion
weapons could still be useful maybe w/in the same hex while moving pretty slow
(crawling actually), but theres just no way to make them useful at multi hex
ranges.  Alot of the "flavor" of these weapons is simply in they\'re damage and
their name.  Just make a laser weapon that matches the performance u want and
say that the "laser molecules" are "fused" by the energy electros of the
dowackey.  (i.e. just handwave something that makes a *laser* into a *fusion
gun*).  I don\'t think its in the interests of the game to perpetuate fantasy
magitech items.  Alot the original stuff isn\'t hard science at all.  Its
simply a bunch of equipment that "sounds scientific like."  Hard science
didn\'t enter into until TNE, IMO.  MT made steps in that direction, but it was
TNE that finally divested itself of the most obvious signs of science fantasy.

Um... maybe that "flavor" was wrong?  I don\'t mean to be insulting here so

This is (again) what TNE did w/ Tplates, but there was a blurb that could be
made for "how" tplates could work and what was wrong w/ them.  There isn\'t a
way (short of extreme reaching) to rationalize plasma/fusion weapons.  The
line had to be drawn somewhere,i\'d guess.   Time simply may have ran out (as
it did w/ FFS2).  Dave, did u consider making plasma/fusion weapons for FFS2?
KKMs have long been an issue (and still is) but w/out resorting to extreme
measures (like Bubba) they\'re not feasable at Traveller ranges if Traveller
laser weapons are as good as they\'re stated to be.

Well the interest to the list is secondary, but there, as it will allow
us to make more Traveller-orientated siftware for ourselves in a
programming medium that is generally accepted nowadays.  I could
continue to write in GWBASIC, but who\'d want to run them?  :)

The authors of TNE made HEPlaR canon in an attempt to rectify the gross
violations of the laws of physics posited by reactionless drives.
Ultimately a referee may use whatever he wants (thrusters or HEPlaR being
the two most popular), but I agree with Richard: There really isn\'t any
point to arguing *against* the canonical validity of HEPlaR.

I don\'t have that issue of Challenge, whatever issue it is.  Because Traveller
doesn\'t use KKMs, no ship is ready for them, but if they were used, ships
would be prepared (and more than a match).  As is, i think most (large)
military ships would have at least a minor dedicated PD battery just in case
someone wants to surprise them (they could also be used to scrub an enemy hull
clean of antennas and such in a boarding action... disable commo etc).  Most
civilian and smaller military ships are probably pretty good targets for
*standard* KKMs.

I think he was meaning the added complication, and I agree. I haven\'t tried it

Because the TL-5 tractor you _can_ fix with a hammer, three wrenches and
a forge is worth 17 TL-12 ones all with a defrabijulator module gone bad.

A colony of necessity needs to be self sufficient, for a time, at least,
and particularly in the case at hand, which is a sub-light colonization
effort.

Low Tech (generally) = Easy to fix

In a real emergency, you can bootstrap to making those hammers and
wrenches, starting with stone tools.

A large HT colony _will_ have severe vulnerabilities that a smaller, LT
one won\'t. Like when the last defrabijulator module goes on your last
tractor. If you had 10,000 mouths to feed, you might get by on muscle
power. With 10,000,000 there\'s just no way to do it; those 10,000,000
people will be counting on their high tech to survive.

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Pi has never been 3. It cannot be. The fact that some primitive bozo (there
apparently is one US state that legislated Pi to be 3) thinks this does not
make it so. Reality does not change with perception, reality is that which
KEEPS exisiting when you stop believing in it. If you do not believe in
gravity, does that mean you do not fall at a constant rate (ignoring
atmospheric friction for now in regards to terminal velocity). No. One does
not make laws of reality, one finds them. Newton discovered the law of
gravity, not gravity

They were no more or less clever than us technologically advanced house
apes. Sometimes, just maybe, humans clear up their perceptions and actually
SEE. I hate to quote a movie, but there is a scene in Men In Black where
Tommy Lee Jones says to Will Smith that "500 years ago everyone "knew" the
earth was flat, and up til 15 minutes ago, you "knew" we were alone on this
planet". But that did not make the earth flat, and did not change the fact
that there were aliens.

  Maybe someone here can help a duffus with a logic problem regarding
traveller (or any other sci-fi system for that matter!)...

  It is expected that random generation systems will produce some rather
bizare planetary systems that violate known "physics" and such.  With that
as a warning, I can accept that any random generation system will produce
flawed results.

  My question then is this: in the First Survey data listings, it talks
about planets with M class stars.  Looking at such planets, one finds
quickly, that such planets are not capable of having free standing liquid
water, and that temperatures on such planets are below freezing.

  Given that fact - how is it possible for planets to have oxygen bearing
atmospheres if such atmospheres are the result of transformations due to
plant life activity (in as far as life as we know it on earth requires)?

  If that is the case - that such planets cannot have breathable
atmospheres unless an attempt is made to terraform it, should all planets
that are not possible to be inside a "habitability" zone be considered
exotic?  That being the case, should there not also be a new trade
classification for frozen worlds or exotic atmospheres or should planets be
equated with "barren" or "airless" worlds?

The comments as to whether or not HEPLaR is canon are really a result of
the abandonment of thruster plates in the transition(*) between MT(**) and
TNE. This got up a lot of people\'s noses at the time (mine included) as
although it was \'more realistic\' it threw a lot of the old Traveller canon
out, and changed the feel of the game.

IMO it would have been better managed if TNE adopted HEPLaR as the standard
ship drive for the RC and ruled that T-Plates were abandoned due to the
technology\'s vulnerability to Virus.

T4, as published has its own little quirks - the version of QSDS in the
rules allows you to build a TL9 ship with a JDrive. However, HEPLaR is a
TL10 technology so you can\'t install a drive on it, something that I hope
TNAS/QSDS2 will solve.

>Just because there were
>>not rules on them specifically doesn\'t make them non cannon.

I agree with your last point.

Dom

(*)Other significant changes include the higher TL of lasers etc.
(Something that irritates me with T4).

(**) I know that High Guard 1st Edition mentioned the use of Fusion
Engines. MT\'s "Hard Times" introduced a whole series of non-Thruster Plate
low tech options (but not HEPLaR) for drives.

Strength lets me carry a gun. Dexterity provided the firm control and proper
squeezing of the trigger.

The assignment of Dex to the Weapon fire task is based on my evaluation of
what is required to shout a weapon. A strong but clumsy person is not usually
accurate. A weak but dextrous person is usually accurate. Strength may come
into play when the weapon is heavy, etc.

In a given weapon situation, a ref could tell the player Str is what matters,
but it should not come a s a surprise (the character probably would know that
well before the situation comes up).

Associated Characteristics
	Characters vary as well in their innate abilities. No matter how skilled an
individual is (for example) in Athletics, physical endurance is also of prime
importance... and of two people with equal skill, the one with greater
endurance will more likely succeed.
	Each skill has at least one characteristic associated with it. In addition,
it is possible that unlisted characteristics may be involved in specific
skills.
	The Connect (Or Disconnect) Between Skill And Ability. Documented skill level
(Skill-2, Skill-4, etc) indicates a recognition of a specific level of
training, experience, or education within the stated skill. Because of the

What It Must Do...

1) Produce realistic results.  No standard atmosphere worlds with oceans
orbiting around dim (M5-M9) red dwarfs, no \'M\' type white dwarf companions
to main sequence stars (or stars less than 10 billion years old of any kind).

2) Have a GUI interface.

3) Be Win 95 compatible.

4) Allow for the dumping of data in a standard fromat into the program so
that it can be converted.

5) Come with on-line help.

6) Be as painless to use as possible (partially accomplished by #2).

   You have a beta tester right here as soon as you require one.

Harold

Ahhh...we\'re using different definitions of \'dead\' here. I mean dead,
unrevivable, nailed-to-the-perch dead, not merely pinin\' for the low
berth dead...

This clearly something that needs clarification; by the time of Traveller
we probably will no longer call it \'death\' when the heartbeat stops, but
when the person can\'t be revived anymore or shows no brainwave
functioning.

Death is an _irreversable_ loss of body functioning...when you\'re heart
stops you get there pretty quick, but if you\'re under adequate care you
won\'t.  IRL we\'re struggling with the definitions of this term, and it\'s
used far too widely. 

Something like \'mortal coma\' is a better description...without care you
_will_ die, and in short order. After all, we don\'t call a severely
injured person dead, even though they will die without care.

It\'s been a few years, but it seems to me that that requires a different
type 
of fiber.  I do remember doing calculations related to this though, and
the 
number of "channels" was dependant on a property of the medium.....

I\'d say that\'s pretty close, or at least close enough not to warrant the

Well, as an example, the Greeks knew the Earth was round and about
how big it was.  Unless such changes are retroactive, history as we
know it is consistent with a spherical Earth.  Geology, seasons,
climates at different lattitudes, etc...

This is a rather silly and pointless argument, though, since any such
changes to the laws of nature are completely transparent to us and
appear as though they are \'real\'...  Any discussion as to the reality
of \'reality\' is better left to a philosophy list and isn\'t relevant
to Traveller...

(unless someone bases a campaign on mutable laws of nature..?)

    This thought crossed my mind over the weekend while going over some of my
TNE stuff.  While I know GURPS Traveller is going to be set in an alternative
universe where the Assassination and Rebellion and the like never happened.
That doesn\'t mean that elements of The New Era wouldn\'t be present or ignored.
Certainly it would be a way to answer some questions that still linger for
those of us TNE folks STILL waiting for a resolution to that game.

    The Cymbaline chips are still there after all and there would be an awful
lot of interest in them for Research purposes alone, never mind the potential
military applications.

    The point raised in MegaTraveller about the Rebellion and fragmentation of
the Imperium\'s political structures under the surface apearance of solidity
still apply as well here.


    And if you want to be really nice... In the GURPS Traveller Universe the
Empress Wave could still be rolling out from the Core.  Nice long term plot
potential and it would be interesting to have the Zhodani and Vargr facing that
problem with the Imperium gradually discovering that they will face it fairly
soon themselves in the decades to come.

    Just some thoughts...

Assuming that the average shot is NOT made while resting the gun on
something, how about the lower of strength or dexterity?  With strength
determining how much recoil you can handle.

Or, if you want to ignore recoil, use the lower of strength or dexterity
for all snapshots, with just dexterity if you spend a round aiming first.

Re: Resolution...

The 300dpi, obviously, looked best, but was much to large for my screen
display. The 90dpi was fast, but too small and had some artifacts.  The
150dpi was a nice compromise.

Re: Color depth...

For b&w and line drawings there\'s no reason to use more than 16
colors/shades of gray. For the color plates, I\'d say use jpeg...yes, you
lose some detail, but it wasn\'t enough to bother me and saves huge amounts
of space.

It will, of course, have an affect on the general shape of the bell curve,
but I can see a lot of problems with it as well.

1) TMLers have already stated their dislike of massive amounts of dice.
   During the Great Task System Debate of \'97, some people claimed that
   even 4 or 5 dice were too many.

2) If you thought there was a big stink over the "half die"...

3) Players will need two additional dice that are marked differently than
   the others-- a green one for the "+D" and a red one for the "-D", for
   example.

4) Making a Difficult Task will now involve four different coloured dice,
   assuming that people will be using yet another colour to differentiate
   the "half die" from all the others.

Partial Solution:

Increase the number of dice used for each difficulty by one (Easy=2D,
Average=3D, Difficult=3.5D, and so on.  The "-D" could then be a single die
of another colour (reducing the total number of coloured dice to a maximum
of three).

I still think it is a bit unnecessary, however.  I thought you (Marc) had
already decided on the current task dice format-- or is that changing as
well?

Another Thought..

[Rant Mode On]

On CT/MT vs. TNE/T4.

I am an oldtimer. I have been playing traveller since dirt was young. 
In my JH and HS days, we loved traveller, and played the heck out of 
it.

When MT hit the market, I snatched it up ASAP. Those books are even 
more worn then my CT books. I think that MT was better in some 
respoects then CT (tho, I longed for the days of really simply ship 
construction).

When TNE hit the market, I snatched it up, and within 2 weeks, sold 
it for 1/2 the amount that I had payed for it. When T4 hit the 
market, I decided to give the New Traveller one more chance. I am now 
going to give it another chance.

I have BL, BR and FFSv1, and v2. I really like some of the stuff. 
However, I really hate some of the stuff.  99% of my beefs with T4 
are in the starship weapons system. (TNE, on the other hand.. I 
really had a problem with a .45 ACP in the chest _scratching_ the 
rather husky human target). I could even understand heplar, as the 
PP\'s got way more effecent, and I saw that the huge amount of fuel 
for the early PP\'s in CT was probally reaction mass (plus, I loved 
one scene where a PC\'s ship was in a rather desprate manuver, got 
shot, and ran outta gas hurtling towards a really big thing<grin>).

IMHO these arguements over hard science are simply reduclious (scuse 
the spelling, I may work for a School, but I an\'t no teacher). 
Traveller is a game. Most traders are not going to have a CIWS 
that could intercept 2,000 100g bb\'s in 1/1000\'th of a second. They 
will use that space for cargo. Money in the bank. Larger warships 
might carry them... so you do not fire the KKM at that 20,000 Dton 
escort cruser. It\'ll just piss it off.

Traveller has been, and hopefully will stay, a game about people. 
charactors. role playing. The technology should take a back seat. 
Yeah, it\'s nice to be able to explain in detail how the 
hydrospanner\'s EMP feild interacts with the dongle\'s JRQ feild 
causing the little light on the bridge to blink.. and there are some 
people who will be intrested in that (like me). But it is hard to 
justify totally changing the way the universe works (three weapons 
per turret vs one for example) because _right now_ our top scientists 
do not think that would work.

I would like to see traveller get back to the simpler days.. I think 
that T4 started in the right direction (it just got derailed before 
it left the station)

Thank you for your time

Fiber optic systems can be "single mode" (where only one laser is doing the
work of sending short bursts of light down the fiber length) or "multimode"
(where multiple lasers "bounce" bursts within the body of the fiber itself).

Single mode is the easiest to conceptualize ... one flashing light sending
lots and lost of information.  Multimode involves conceptualizing the fiber as
a big "pipe" with reflective walls.  If you point a light at a mirror, it will
"bounce" at a specific angle ... and in multimode fiber, light just keeps
bouncing and bouncing down the length of the fiber (yes, there are rules about
the angle you\'re allowed to "bend" the fiber during install, so that
propagation is not impacted) till it reaches the sensor at the far end of the
fiber.

There\'s also multiwave fiber systems being deployed ... different FREQUENCIES
of light are used to "multiplex" data streams along the same fiber.  Think of
the next door neighbor using both a red and blue flashlight to signal you with
Morse code from across the street.  You\'re basically getting two signals in
the same transmission medium (the airspace between the houses).

Visible light has a LOT of different frequencies ... so given a high enough
tech level, you could just keep using more and more frequencies to transmit
LOTS and LOTS of data.

	Lasers _and_ sensors. And given the work Bruce has done on the
sensor system, I believe the figures it gives. The lasers become
necessary to stick with other aspects of Traveller "canon."  But
I agree with those who\'re trying to come up with something that

I figure about 10 cc per embryo (human or otherwise), including containment

That means that they would have to have how many children?  Even if they

Didn\'t they use escape pods when abandoning the NCC-1701-D in the movie
where the Borg took over the ship in the past.  (You know the one where the
Borg were trying to stop first contact between Earth and the Vulcans.  Come
to think of it I think it was called First Contact.)

Having lived most of my life in farm country in the heartland of one of
highest tech countries on the face of this planet, I have a surprise for
some of you.  Horses (and mules and even occasionally cows) are still used
to draw machinery to work the land in some places.  Tractors that are 50 and
60 years old (what is 3 tech levels below current?) are also in use by men
who inherited them from their fathers and grandfathers.

Just because there is higher technology available, does not mean it will be
used for all applications.  These same men would be incensed if the EMS
brought a 50 or 60 year old ambulance to pick them up if they were injured,
not because it was old, but because for so vital a use, you should use the
best technology you have.

Have you ever seen a replicar?  They are cars that are built to the exact
same standards as the original.  I\'ve seen designs from the 20\'s and 30\'s
that are built just like they were in the 20\'s and 30\'s.  Sometimes they use
better materials because they are stronger or less expensive, but my point
is that just because you could more easily fix a TL-5 tractor, that doesn\'t
mean you would start your colony at TL-5.  You\'d start it where the mother
world was and use the accumulated knowledge to build the low tech items that
would serve you better.

Did you ever do the string around the can experiment?  If you do, it is
obvious that the relationship between the r and the c is more than 3.  Don\'t
you think the ancients could see as well as you?  Do you think they couldn\'t
tell the difference?  As you point out, they were no more or less clever
than we, and yet, they couldn\'t see that the string they used to measure the
circumference was more that 3 times the length of it\'s radius?

As for the world being flat, I believe it was for the same reason as I
believe that at one time the correct value of Pi was 3 exactly.  Because of
the reports of those same equally intelligent people that lived in ancient
days.  The sea faring peoples did not speak of the ships disappearing over
the horizon, the spoke of them as getting smaller and smaller until you
could not see them any more.  Even on as large a planet as we live on, this
would not happen if the surface you were on was curved.

I maintain that people find what they look for!

Well, there *is* that. ;->  I like to spread the skills across the
attributes too and wasn\'t looking at it the way you were.

OTOH, if you don\'t tie a skill *strictly* to one attribute you can get the
balancing effect you are looking for without forcing things.  Use STR to
hold a weapon on target on 2nd+ shots, use DEX to aim the weapon, use STR
as a threshold to avoid -DMs, etc.

Just and idea.

Andrew, I grok your meaning, but you are running into the same physics
problems I was posting about earlier. ;-> The difference in effective
ranges between plasma/fusion (HE weapons) and the laser/paws (beam weapons)
are just TOO big. I can see HE weapons out to 30,000km being effective and
60,000 possible, but beyond that their velocity is just too darn slow. If
you can come up with a handwave that doubles or triples that without
breaking every other technology I\'m all with you, and maybe you can find a
way to cut the beam weapon\'s range in half while you\'re at it.  <no joke>

I haven\'t tried this, but are we sure that det-lasers *have* to be nuclear?
Might it be possible to build single shot chemically pumped det-lasers,
maybe a combination of EPG\'s and big laser cartridges?

Hear! Hear! I argued for alternative tech to be included in FFS2 and got

alternatives, but I can\'t say I agreed with it.  Of course, *I\'ve* never

Marc, the "a bit unnecessary" might not be the range of values, it might be
the rolling of an extra two dice and a subtraction on every damage roll. I
like the concept of +/-, but without playtesting it I\'m not sure it adds
enough functionality to offset the addtional complexity. It\'s a "have to
try it before you can tell" type of thing.

Writing in DOS still gives you maximum coverage.

Yeap, and while we\'re at it the Trav software writers should come up with a

Sounds good to me, but if this is a GUI then an well written and searchable

Yes to the first half, not necessarily to the second. ;->

You missed the whole point.  It\'s not the words, but the reality that
underlies the words.  If reality shifts, then everything shifts.  If Pi gets
larger, then the circles get larger (area-wise) too.  Nothing stops, it just
changes and continues.

Right, that\'s the way I see it.  A person riddled with bullets, dumped into
a vacuum, run throw with a sword may be go down and be *dead* soon, but
still be revivable given immediate medical attention.

Your T4.1 rules have a PC going unconscious after 2 stats go negative and
dying when all 3 drop to 0 or below.  I\'d have them start rolling against
*something* when 1 stat goes to 0 to prevent falling unconscious, going
down with 2 and being irrevocablely dead with all 3.

Additionally, I think unattended wounds should continue to worsen turn by
turn.  Say every turn without treatment you lose 1 point from one of your
above 0 stats?  Now our hero can continue on after the fight without
medical attention, but only for so long before she wears down and falls
unconscious, and if she still doesn\'t get attention she will eventually
die.  Of course, if you do it this way you\'ll have to deal with the
"killing scratch."  ;->

Ok, what *would* make (non bb) kkm missiles feasible?

 1.  Shorter Sensor ranges - Ships would have less time to detect and
     target the missiles.
        
 2.  Shorter Laser ranges - Ships would have less time to shoot the
     missiles it did detect.
                            
 3.  Less accurate targeting - Lasers hit less often.
   
 4.  Much higher accelerations for missiles - Missiles cross kill zone
     faster and are harder to target.

What do I think about these 4 possibilities?

1.  I think a lot of us would like to lower sensor *lock* ranges
    somewhat.  Personally, I think active ships should be able to see
    each other much further than their weapon\'s can lock and hit
    targets...well that\'s the game effect I\'d like to see.  Of course,
    sensing isn\'t locking and ships are much larger than missiles.  The
    *physics* is against me on this one, but it\'s still the game effect
    I\'m looking for.

2.  Ranges for weapons, laser and PAW, are longer than I like.  OK,
    *effective* range is shorter, but not as short as I\'d like.  I think
    anything beyond 3 light seconds is just too dang far away (for game
    reasons), and I wouldn\'t object if effective ranges were between 1
    and 2 ls, but not shorter.  Again physics is probably against me.
    Part of my "gaming reason" is I\'d like to to keep the counters "on
    the mat" that means shorter than what we have now.
    
3.  Physics again, I guess. 

4.  Higher accelerations for missiles...physics!  ;-> Ok, personally,
    I\'m not enthusiastic about this one, that way leads to space
    fighters and I\'m not a fighter man.
    
Now about the Heplar/Thruster thing.  

In CT maneuver drives *did* use mass, their exhaust was dangerous, however
they were too efficient to be straight fusion drives.  So, they weren\'t
called Heplar..they more or less acted like them.  You just didn\'t track
fuel use closely..for ease of play mostly.

In MT the Reactionless Thruster came along and it has a lot to recommend it
for easy game play.  We\'ve been hassling with the handwave behind them ever
since.  ;-> 

I think the only reactionless technique that really holds together is some
sort of stutterwarp (limited to stl, of course) because it doesn\'t break
the conservation laws..at least not too obviously.  But stutterwarp has
problems too *because* it doesn\'t monkey around with momentum.  We *need* a
maneuver drive that will produce a real momentum change.

Here\'s how I\'m going to handle it.  

Maneuver drives come in a variety of types, but all of them, expect one,
require reaction mass, and that one (stutterwarp) doesn\'t change a ship\'s
momentum..just its position.  Stutterwarp is much faster and more effecient
in deep space than *any* other drive, but doesn\'t work *at all* in an
atmosphere and more importantly doesn\'t allow a ship to match vectors with
a planet, space station, or another ship.  Once they become technically
possible they quickly replace reaction drives on ships as the main
in-system drive.

However, every ship must also mount a second drive with enough delta-v to
match vectors.  This is generally Heplar.  Heplar is the most effecient of
the reaction drives (actually *too* effecient, so if we go this way I\'d
recommend we back off on Heplar\'s thrust/weight ratio a little), but it
*does* require mass.  It is used to lift and land on planets, to match
orbits with a planet after jumping into a system, or to match vectors with
a ship.  It *isn\'t* used to fly long distances across a system, not if your
stutterwarp is working anyway.

How about it gearhead breathern, doesn\'t this make sense?

Let\'s not make that always, there\'s all kinds of accounts of people wounded
in battle and passing out from blood loss coming back around, sometimes
later in the day or even after a night on the "cold, cold ground" and
managing to live with out treatment.

Why even waste a good ship like that.  Why not use it as a trading vessel. 
IOW, why not rip out the cold sleep berthes & use the area as a cargo bay
to bring much needed items to the new colony?  Now I can see if it was
built for a one way trip, but most ships aren\'t.

You can also modulate the light in the same manner you do FM radio
signals. If you do this, with a ring-synchronous laser array, you can pump
VASTLY more data down the fibre. This is not new technology (c. 1985 for
prototypes).

There is a theoretical limit, calculated in the same way that you
calculate the \'carrying capacity\' of the radio spectrum, but I no longer
have access to a technical library to fund the formulae.  Anyone with a
decent textbook on information theory and the upper and lower frequencies
carried by singlemode fibre (without dispersing) could do the calculation
for us, though.  Any takers?

Bruce\'s sensor rules are too good to mess with. The other problem is
that if the sensor task isn\'t automatic at some (short) range then
KKMs will certainly dominate combat (you can\'t shoot them down if
you can\'t see them) since you can make big KKMs then.

Usually the range at which you actually get FC on missiles is at
that automatic range, so it\'s in the 1/2 hex range.

>  3.  Less accurate targeting - Lasers hit less often.
    
Again, even firing at random into the possible postions of the
target hits every time at a certain range since the target can\'t
move in the beam travel time.

Then they hit and really kill you, on missile, one kill.

> 1.  I think a lot of us would like to lower sensor *lock* ranges
 
Knowing where they are right now (not even a course) is a lock at
short ranges since they can possible move out of the way in the beam
travel time.

I don\'t see too much combat at that kinda range anyway using things
lie BR/BL. In fact most effective fire (other than shots just
because you feel like you ought to shoot once in a while) is around
1ls. YMMV.

I think KKMs are not impossible at all. BTW, I keep using KKM
because at *any* version of traveller\'s closing velocities a missile
will have far more KE than explosive energy if it bothers with a
warhead. They are not terribly effective against military forces,
true, but that doesn\'t mean that they don\'t exist. The fact that a
..25 handgun is a toy as far as military armored fighting vehicles
goes doesn\'t mean it can\'t kill me through my truck window.

KKMs would be dangerous vs. civies, there is no question. Commerce
raiders might use small (hell, CT sized, maybe) KKMs to kill
shipping. Sure, some whould get shot down, but if one hits...

Shotgun type KKMs (fragmentation) would do small amounts of surface
damage, but that is still useful.

Don\'t sell them short because the TL-15 Imperium can hose them down
easily. And besides at lower TLs (I play in the CT setting :-) they
might be more useful.

As I recall, blood loss is the major factor in battlefield survival.
Prompt medevac saves lives because they can get them someplace to
stop the bleeding. Bleeding out is bad.

Cases like the above will happen, so it might be a good idea to have
a roll to clot off somehow. Cold conditions will help, compression
will help, and so forth. Someone with minimal knowlege could attempt
a task to minimize bleeding (first aid, basically) and the result
might be the loss of a point per 10minutes, or hour or something
until they get proper attention.

The GM could also decide if the wound will get better with whatever
treatment has been done----it might have been a through and through
wound that doesn\'t hit anything vital and just get better if kept
clean (assuming the initial bleed was stopped so the guy is alive).

If I wasn\'t so lazy I\'d turn on the light and grab one of the
surgery books 2 ft from me, maybe they\'d have something useful to
say. *sigh*

Sorry, but I do find that slightly insulting. How can my campaign be

I have used nothing but standard Traveller rules...even if those rules

The point is, the line had already been drawn in CT - PA turrets &
barbettes,
and Plasma/Fusion weapons DO EXIST in the canon Traveller universe - I
got tons
of GDW books that say so. So some effort must be made to support these
items in
the newer versions, even if (like in TNE with thrusters) a
disclaimer/sidebar is
added stating the scientific reasons as to why such a system is not
likely.

Sorry for the tone of this letter...if you meant no offence by your
post, I
apologize for mine. But I was slightly offended by the tone of your
letter -
basically suggesting (as I read it) that my concerns were irrational.
Being a
long time Traveller player, I take exception to that.

But if I misread you, I apologize.

The Fusion Guns in space issue is easy to fix. In High Guard, Fusion Guns
were short range, high damage weapons with high power consumption.

In FFS2 terms, this tranlates to a Circular PAW. If I remember correctly,
FGs in HG were 3 EP weapons, so thats 750 MW. Assume a shot every 2
minutes, so we have 750x120 MJ to play with - 80 000 MJ. This will allow a
lot of laps.

End summary : a short-range weapon substantially more hard-hitting than a
laser.

KKMs are excellent auxilary weapons. Essentially to fight them you need a
CIWS optimised for engagements in the 10-15 000 km range. Essentially, this
means a short range military MFD (to get the +4 to hit - MCr 0.27 at TL12),
a LIDAR (MCR 0.5), a point-defense ballistic computer (MCr 0.2 at TL12), a
rapid-fire laser capable of punching 2cm of superdense (about MCr 3.0) and
a gunner somewhat better than civilians tend to pay for (gunner-3 or so).
Cost is about MCr 4 or so, plus a power demand of about 500MW while the
laser is firing.

Oh yeah, and a battery of your own KKMs, just in case the other guy\'s KKMs
have armour thicker than your PD laser can deal with.

Now, your average small military ship is going to have these things, as
will big, heavily-armed freighters. Your average Far Trader, OTOH, wont,
and will have to try and eyeball the missile with their main anti-ship
laser battery, without a fancy fire control solution and hope like hell
they hit the missile (which is probably evading at 10 gees), because it\'s
one shot per 10 seconds or less.

End summary - KKMs are great civilian weapons, excellent for use by and
against ethically challenged civilians, but not a military weapon.

In short, just like a fac 4 missile battery guided by a 1bis computer was
in HG.

PAW barbettes are a bit more of an issue. A 16m long, 2 m diameter PAW at
TL14 has an effective range of roughly 225 000km (Effective focal area of
12pi, effective tunnel length of 8 meters), and a maximum output of 256 MJ.

End summary : a lot like a laser, immune to sand, does radiation damage but
doesnt have the extreme range capability of lasers.

Must have.  Well, even so, why waste a good ship.  If you have the plans

In At Close Quarters, there are tasks to stay conscious at each level of
wounding.  When you\'ve dropped to 0 in all three stata, you are bleeding to
death and will die after losing 10 more points.  I wrote that as a "death\'s
door" escape.

Also in ACQ.  Without treatment, wounds worsen overtime.  Superficial
wounds (no characteristics lowered to zero) do not degrade beyond lowering
a single stat to 0.

Look for "Psionics Institutes" for T4.  One of the better books to be
released.  It has some expanded rules on Psionics, and extensive rules on
setting up institutes, attitudes towards psionics, pro and anti groups..

For ACQ, we\'re having different AP costs based on MT-style Recoil (2 for L,
4 for M, 6 for H).  I wanted to get away from using Dexterity since in our
system your Action Point Pool is DEX+INT+Tactics.  You can use extra AP to
increse your target number (up to a certain limit.)  So for me, the basic
STR requirement in the skill task is the proper hold on the weapon, and
high DEX gives you enough AP to improve your aim.

I\'ve used every stat at one time or another with the weapon\'s skills.
(Even SOC, to allow a character to recognize the shotgun as being an
antique worth several thousand credits.)

My favorite use of DEX with guns is reloading and clearing jams.. this are
two evolutions that require speed and precision.

The time it takes for the brain to die from lack of oxygen. All the other
gory stuff like lungs exploding (from holding your breath) etc are probably
repairable but the skull could keep the brain sort of pressurized to
survive a couple of minutes.
Messy though...

If you hold your breath in vacuum you\'ll die real soon. Your lungs will
explode up through your throught with a massive loss of blood and oxygen.
Hyperventilate before vacuum exposure, then keep your mouth open to let the
gas in your lungs escape nicely.

To test this DONT DO THIS!
Dive to 10m water and fill your lungs from your diving tubes. Hold your
breath while you go up to the surface and keep it so. OUCH!

Most small ships do not have the room/cash for a sickbay so canon still
holds. Low passage on large ships is more or less safe but they\'re only
going where you do not want to go...

+D-D is not about task resolution; it is about hit points. Once a task (say,

I don\'t know if they are trying to be insulting, but I can\'t help but take
exception to some recent comments made in this topic thread. Maybe I\'m
overreacting, but it has been suggested that my desire for HE weapons to be
returned to the Traveller ruleset is somehow "wrong". In particular, I made
the statement that one of my campaign races prefered the use of HE weapons
due to some social/tactical issues (they prefere close combat over long
ranged) - and the statement was made that perhaps I designed this race
"wrong".

Again, perhaps I\'m overreacting (after all, its only a game). But I don\'t
see how my use of canon technology can be construed as being wrong -
scientifically unsound, perhaps - but not wrong.

For better or worse, wether you like them or not, the following items ARE
canon: Thrusters, HE weapons on starships, PA turrets, PA barbettes, lower
tech repulsors, Virus, HEPlaR, Fusion+, KKMs, etc..

I added to the above list several other items, because they are things that
I\'m not fond of (in particular, Virus). However, THEY ARE canon, and I would
expect to see rules for Virus in Next Era milleu books and/or sourcebooks on
computers. As a referee, I would simply say "I don\'t like Virus, I\'m not
going to use it." But I certainly would not accuse any of the die-hard TNE
fans of being "wrong" for supporting Virus - because evn if I feel it is
utterly scientifically unsound and a poor plot device - it IS CANON. End of
story.

I can site tons of material that describe these above items. They are a part
of the Traveller history. Thus, I feel it is important to support them, even
if in a sidebar.

One of the problems I have with gearheads (and I use that term as a
compliment - I wish I knew half as much as you guys know about physics and
engeineering) analyzing technology is that such analysis is always based
upto current technology and the so-called "logical" progression of areas of
technology.

Lets look at PAs for a moment. I have little or no real-world knowledge
about such matters, so I will apologize ahead of time if the following
statements are wrong. Currently, here in 1998, we can accelerate particles
in two ways: long linear tunnels, and toroids. Thus, FF&S models these two
items. The efficiency improvement (such as the "lengthening" of the
effective tunnel length) is handwaved as improvements in superconducting
magnets, better energy storage, etc...

....what there isn\'t is a fundamental breakthrough. TL 15 PAs are no
different than TL 8 PAs...they simply have better magnets, better
accumulators, more power, etc. In my mind, TL 15 PAs could possibly have
RADICAL differences fomr the earlier PAs...perhaps the particles are formed
different now, or accelerated differently, or whatever...the point is, no
one on this list, unless you have the gift of prophecy, can say that there
is no way to put a TL 15 PA in a turret. Sure...a long tunnel won\'t fit in
the turret - but maybe tunnels aren\'t needed any more.

It actually bothers me sometimes that we have reduced some of the cool
aspects of this FAR future game to an elementary college physics text. I\'m
not against the "solidifying" of the technology - but I think its safe to
handwave a fair amount of it. Jump drives. Contra-Grav. Small PAs. High
Energy weapons. Repulsors. Etc.

Note that it has been pointed out that HE weapons need to be fixed for other
reasons...in many cases these fearsome (according to canon) weapons are
still outperformed by CPR guns. That seems against the spirit of the game,
even if it happens to be physcially correct.

This was perhaps a bit longer than I wanted, and I apologize if this was a
bit heavy handed. Its just some of the previous posts hit me the wrong way,
I guess...

What about tidal energy heating the planet enough to get some energy
gradients for life to emerge (like the Jupiter moons)? Probably not as this
tidal force would soon synchronize the planet to the star. Hey, wait! If
the planet is synchroniced then the subolar area (closest to the sun) might
get hot enough for life. Or the planet could have been terraformed
including oxygenizing the atmos by humans or ancients or progenitors or
whatever. There are lots of answers to particular cases of weird planets
but the general fact that there are LOTS of planets in orbits around suns
that cannot heat them enough still remain. We could perhaps postulate that
there are orbits insode the 0.2 AU innermost orbit from Scouts (Q: why BTW
do the orbits have to be the same in all starsystems A: It makes life
easier for the referee).

There\'s a T4 book on the topic called \'Psionic Institutes\'. Unfortunately,

open...

If your new colony is close enough to the mother civilizaton to trade with
it, why not go back and fetch another load of colonists? Or sell it to
someone else who wants to set up a colony? Only if there is no further
need for a colony ship would it be economically sound to convert it into
a freighter.

Undoubtedly risky Low Berths was canon in CT. It was not so (or a lot
less so) in MT. And you didn\'t need a whole sickbay to make it so. You
did need a competent medic, which may give an out...

The big problem with the risky Low Berths is not the risk itself (people
tend to believe that the universe makes personal exceptions for them), but
that a safe, cheap alternative is available with official CT rules.

Take a passenger. Give him a dose of Fast Drug (Cr 200). Put him in a
bunk bed. Deliver him at his destination. Overhead: Cr 200. Number of
passengers per DT: Varies with your assumptions, but a lot more than 1.
(Remember, all you need are the bunks themselves and access space. No
recreational facilities, practically no life support equipment (About
3% of whatever is required for someone awake). Cost of a "Fast Berth":
About 5-600 credits.

Admittedly, there are problems if you insist on sticking rigidly to
CT drug rules; you either have to have recovery dormitories at the
arrival starport where the passengers can sleep off the remainder of
their time in Fast trance (30 days as opposed to the 8-9 days they
spend on board the ship), which will add a few credits to the cost, or
you have to spring for a Fast Antidote at Cr 900. However, even with
the fast antidote you could get the price of a ticket down to Cr1,500
or so, which is about what a Low Berth ought to cost if you work out
a realistic price for it. Also, I suspect that if you can develop a
Fast Drug that keeps you in trance for 30 days, you can develop one
that will only last you 10 days if there is a demand for it. And there
will be a demand if it can cut the price of a starship ticket by two
thirds. You\'d still need recovery lounges at the starport, because I
doubt you can time a Fast dose to last exactly a specific number of
hours (not a cheap, standard dose anyway), and even if you could, you
don\'t know just how long the trip will take thanks to the +- 1 day for
jump durations. Perhaps that is why Fast Passage isn\'t mentioned in
connection with Free Trader economics; perhaps Class D and E starports
don\'t have the facilities to cater to Fast passengers. But it should
certainly be a feature between higher class starports. It makes sense,
economically.

Also note that Fast Passage is ideal for medium and long distance travel;
you can carry a passenger for two or even three jumps on the same 30 day
dose and thus practically the same overhead. If fast drug can be taken
consecutively without debilitating effects, it should be the passage of
choice for colony transports too. Now how is that for a canon-breaker?

Now, assume that for some reason 10-day Fast Drug is impossible or (more
likely) expensive. Further assume that Low Berth is slightly cheaper
than a Fast Berth with antidote. Finally assume that Low Berth is just
as safe as Fast Berth. If so, Low Berths survive because the passenger
don\'t have to spend three weeks after arrival unconcious.

Now assume that Low Berth is risky. Now passengers can chose between a
measurable chance of death and either three extra weeks unconcious for
much less than the cost of a Low Berth or to pay a bit more, but to be
safe. If so, Low Berths do not, IMO, exist as a standard means of travel.

It wouldn\'t have to be the first generation alone that bore them. They\'d
just keep it up with the next generations until they ran out of embryos
or the refigerator broke down, whichever came first.

On a related note, I tried working out the growth rate of a colony with
people ranging from 20 to 29 years, no children or older people (I know
someone mentioned something about a few children of every age group being
necessary for some social reason, but I\'m ignorant of these matters and
have ignored it (More information on this subject would be appreciated)).
I assumed that every woman would bear, on the average, one child (that
would survive into adulthood) every 5 years and that they would bear
children from the ages of 20 to 49. also I assumed no significant number
of accidental deaths among women of child-bearing age (All assumptions
open to debate, I know). Calculations are simple to begin with; by the
time they became tedious enough for me to quit I had carried them to the
71st year. In that time a colony with 10,000 women grew to a population
(male and female) of 300,000+.

With other assumptions (like all women having a child per year) you can
get some truly amazing growth figures for the first couple of generations.
Not too realistic, IMO. But you could.

Not at all. Or, if you did, we are most of us sinners here.

The three most frequent reasons why posts don\'t get a response are:

1) No one cared enough about the subject;
2) Everybody assumed somebody else would respond; and
3) Some cared enough that they intended to respond, but got sidetracked
   before that happened.

In this case none of the above applied. I read your first message 15
minutes ago and just didn\'t get around to responding before reading your
second ;-).

For a new, private Traveller universe your ideas have merit. For the
original Traveller universe the original canon was the habitable worlds
and the canon-breaker is the star classifications that was introduced later.
Indeed, as I understand it, (Marc, correct me if I\'m wrong) the original
idea was that the stars shown on the maps were only the ones with useful
planets but that there were lots of stars in between without any use. Then
later these stars were ignored and later again forgotten. Then, when the
rules for determining star class were written, the authors cared more for
making them scientifically correct than for keeping the Traveller canon
intact. Thus all those weak stars. IMO the right thing to do would have
been to make M class stars very rare and let the Scientifically Correct
stellar distribution go hang.

BTW. my personal opimion is that \'scientifically correct\' is a term that,
in connection with RPGs, ought to be as suspect as \'Politically Correct\'
is in other contexts. Even for a \'Hard\' SF game like Traveller, science
is only a means to get a useful RP environment, not an end in itself.
Playability requires that a game universe have consistent rules. But
they do not HAVE to be the same rules that applies in the real universe.
Granted, if you keep your rules Scientifically Correct you\'re guaranteed
consistent rules. But consistency is only half of what makes a game
universe playable. The other half is simplicity, and if you insist on
being 100% Scientifically Correct, simplicity is apt to suffer.

I agree with you 100%. While a multi-million population colony on a
world circling a M9 star is possible in an 1100 year old interstellar
civilization is quite possible, it should be a lot rarer than those on
Terran-type planets and also a lot rarer just after the Long Night.

I know just what you mean.  It\'s easy for them to stand back a criticise.
They didn\'t spend the hours you did making sure the race in question
was coherent and fit with in your milieu.  They didn\'t spend the hours
of loving labor needed to write everything up so that anyone who read
it could understand it.  I\'ll bet they didn\'t even stop to think of the
effect
thier comments might have on the man who spent all that time and
invested all that skull sweat to get that race just so.  If you design a
component for your campaign that does not violate cannon, it cannot
be "wrong".  If I choose to not use your race in my campaign, I still
shouldn\'t belittle your work.  (BTW, if you have the write up in an email

For stimulated emission, a tunnel is still needed, but one a
thousandth the size used by the methods you mentioned earlier.
Instead of kilometers long, it need only be meters long.

I\'m a diehard gearhead (remember, I\'m that guy still sitting on the
rubber sheet with his hand out in another thread), but I have to
agree with Mr. Akins on this.  It is, after all, as he pointed out at
the start of this post, a game.  A game that has been around for
over 20 years with an unknown number of man-hours of
dedicated and loving thought poured into it.  I still don\'t like any
of the explainations I have heard for the Jump Drive, but if we
are going to call it Traveller, that\'s the high tech method you use
for going between the stars.

This is actually fairly reasonable - if you cheat a little on how grav
focus works, or allow the "Explosive chemical lasers" to operate at somewhat
shorter wavelengths than normal lasers, and can live with 5000km as the detonation
range. I have some sketches for warheads like this - I\'ll post them when
I get the chance.

Also, I\'m willing to bend enough on impact/fragmentation missiles to admit
that you probably can get reasonable fragmentation missiles, but that
to have any chance of surviving point defence they need to detonate
so far out that they typically get 1 1-gram (or so) BB hit per target - 
which is not an unreasonable level of damage.

But you can\'t start at the motherworld level without the motherworld
infrastructure. Yoou\'re looking at a world that has had several thousand
years of cumulative technological advancement. Those farmers aren\'t going
to complain too much if the TL5 ambulance is working, and the TL-12 one
isn\'t and the nearest replacement parts are 15 LY away by slow boat. Or
the replacement parts for the factory...or the relacement parts for the
factory-building stuff.... 

They may well retain the knowledge for moving to TL-12, and the rise will
be quite rapid, if the world has the resources to accomplish this, but
when you\'re starting from scratch, you can\'t depend on the infrastructure
because it isn\'t there. The colony cannot depend on everything always
working..stuff breaks unexpectedly, a new world always has
surprises...what happens if your automated tractor factory get\'s destroyed
by an earthquake? On earth, you simply get the parts from another factory
somewhere else.  Unless you\'re speaking of transplanting entire _worlds_
that\'s not going to be feasable for your putative colony.

So what is a TL-5 level tractor built by a TL-12 culture??

There is only one reason why IG can not fulfill your needs. Space! There
is simply IMHO not enough space in books like FF&S2 to cover everything.
The books need to be at a low enough price to be sold and that gives IG a
roof on their production cost. To insure that everything that has been
used throughout the countless supplements for Traveller from the
seventhies until now is impossible. There is unfortunally not enough
reasources or money, again IMHO. 

I think that the word canon is an abomnation that promtly should be put to
death. The four versions of Traveller ar in my view four different set of
rules for a science fiction game with a common theme. The storyline is
IMHO not dependent on the use of KKM, HEPlaR, Thruster Plates,
Plasma/Fusion Guns, Laser. The few things that is needed to conserve the
storyline (Jump being one) has been keept. If you want the CT flauver on
your Traveller use CT, you want MT use MT, and so on.

I\'d think this would be the way to go for convetional missiles. Assuming
that the to-hit is standardized on Small targets, beating the roll
by X points can always increas the damage. Since the roll will be
easier on big ships, this works with the idea that a missile that
gets one hit on a Scout will get several on a BB sized ship (i use
lower case for bearing balls just to be clear from a Battleship, BB
:-)

I would add that against unarmed (or damaged so they can\'t shoot)
targets the missiles could be set to hit with the whole missile and
be pretty nasty. Personally I like writing the rules for using KKMs
of death, then playing out the anti-missile fire to see if they get
through. Obviously it would take a large number to get thrrough any
real defenses, but that doesn\'t mean it couldn\'t happen, just that
people would be unlikely to try since they know how tough it is.

Methinks you are perhaps over-reacting a small amount.  Of course, I may
have missed the posts to which you are replying, but most of the ones I
have seen are pointing out some real problems with certain bits of canon
you are attached to.  (I like the Traveller canon, in general, but it has
things in it that just should not be, because they break simple physics AND
lead to in-game situations where it becomes obvious.)

The unsound part is the problem.  IMO, saying a race likes short ranged,
powerful weapons is a good thing.  Saying they like fusion beams is a
problem ONLY because of the problems that have surfaced with fusion beams.
I agree, it is a pain that the fusion beam is not doable with present
understanding.

A big problem with all of these comes down to how it plays.  If you change
the range you can hit someone at, then weapons become invalidated.
Further, the players figure it out darn fast.  For example, long before the
new sensor rules, my players pointed out that they should be able to detect
fairly well out to 100 diameters, and any world with half a brain would
have a set of sensors that could do so.  They even had a carefully worked
out defense web that would make a world darn hard to take by surprise, and
showed that a TL 9 world could do it with off the shelf technology and a
relatively small investment.

They asked then if they could drop by a TL9 planet to pick up a spy
satellite and a Hubble to improve their detection and ranging in their
system.  This was not happy making, as it showed that the astronomer in the
group knew a hell of a lot more about the issues than I did, and that I
could not tell her to just ignore it.  It would be like telling a present
day gun nut that his .45 pistol has a hundred round magazine capacity.
They just cannot ignore it.

Unfortunately for us, Traveller does not suffer from Star Trek Syndrome,
where useful tech is just ignored after the episode.  If you let Virus
exist to make a TL12 AI, then some player is going to try to figure it out.
 It cannot be the end of the story, because there are problems, and we need
a way around them.  After Virus, AI is a TL12 technology, not 17.

I do agree with your point here, though perhaps not in the way you
intended.  A side bar describing that these things used to exist, and why
they are not a part of the current canon would be a great help.  Mentioning
that there is a problem with reactionless thrusters, or with non-nuke
missiles, will make it easier on the ref, as the problem is a known one.
Given them a way to fix it, either by ignoring the problem, or hand waving.

All technology follows logical progressions up to the breakthrough you
mentioned, but you still do not get to toss out logic when a breakthrough
comes by.  For example, if we know how light focused now, we can trust that
it will go the same way unless we break it.  Once we break it, we must live
with it.  Grav focusing as an annular 1G field does not allow you to make a
burning lens out of the entire star, but if it did, then someone is going
to do it, and it is not that much harder a problem than a TL 10 laser turret.

If fusion beams come back, and give a beam that goes near light speed, then
they are very like PAs.  If they do not, then they have a hard time
hitting.  A proposal to bring them back would be welcome, since I like
different weapons mixes, but the issues do not go away easily.

Fair enough.  I do hope you see this as not an attack, but a comment on why
things have ended up in a state where certain parts of old canon contradict
new canon, and lead to serious discrepancies that are difficult to resolve.

You are missing one point, I think.  The ancients, as you have named them,
were not of one mind.  There were strong disagreements about whether the
ratio was exactly three, or something else.

In point of fact, it was a killing disagreement, as they could quite easily
work out that the ratio was not one that fit into a rational number, and
thus could not be expressed as a fraction.  Given this, that meant that
there was another kind of number than a rational.  Given the importance of
numerology, having a new category of number was not a pretty sight.  It was
then the equivalent of today announcing that the Messiah has come, and that
Christ was a myth.  (Whether it is true is not as important for this debate
as the strength and depth of people\'s reactions.  You can get killed in
certain parts of the world by insulting the majority faith.  You can get
ostracized for not sharing the lack of it in other places.)

Even the Egyptians knew that the ratio was something on the order of 22/7,
right?  I do not have my copy of History of Pi here, but ISTR that they
were fairly advanced in the great search for the true value, though they
did not accept nonrational results.

Among the Greeks, the Pythagoreans came up with the definite need for a
square root in a simple physical system, and proved that it could not be
expressed as a rational.  Proving that the ratio of circumference to
diameter is either a rational or an irrational was a big political hay.
Imagine the present day, if the democrats had a proof of Fermat\'s last
theorem that required a new class of mathematics, and the Republicans
thought it bunk.  Consider that in this fantasy world, power flowed to the
smartest, and a key judgement of intelligence was grasp of geometry.  Only
a small set of the ruling class was even allowed to enter the debate, and
that they were considered equally authorities on mathematics, philosophy,
and law.

If you read Aristotle, you quickly note a strong theoretical bias, such
that good theory should be valued over good experiment.  In point of fact,
this might have been a good idea, as there was a lot of terrible
experimentation, and the principle of reproducibility had not been firmly
accepted by experimentalists of the time - many reports did not contain
sufficient information to reproduce the effects.

This does mean, though, that a number of facts stated as facts were clearly
contradicted by other facts stated as facts by other philosophers, in ways
that a simple observation could have settled, but nether side wanted to do
the experiment.  They felt, as you apparently do, that the better argument
would be correct, and that merely measuring it would not lead to a deep truth.

As a result, they knew roughly what that ratio was, but disagreed about the
meaning behind it.  Since that meaning was important, a lot of early
natural philosophy became bound up with politics.  Much like there was no
particular reason for science and religion to get so annoyed with each
other for so long, save that a few strong personalities wanted it to be so
during the formative years, and felt that scientific might should equate to
political power, while their religious counterparts disagreed violently.

Hmmm.  Given that both the Greeks and the Phoenicians spoke of things
requiring a circular earth, I cannot agree with the above.  (The Greeks had
size measurement, while the Phoenicians used what simplifies to spherical
trigonometry for navigation.  It was not quite correct, as I recall, so
that Greek sailors had a navigational advantage.  Greeks knew that
Euclidean geometry was invalid over large sea distances.)  The drop below
the horizon becomes more pronounced the larger the ship, and thus the
distance it can be seen at, so I suspect there is room for doubt about
accounts based on small ships, a la the Polynesian cultures.

Another slight problem I have with the relative theory of yours - at
different times, different groups believed different things.  What was
"real"?  Or did each group live in a different world?

Just to be clear, I assume that reality is what is there when nobody is
looking, and that all of our desires and wishes alter it not one whit.  If
a creator is running around, on the other hand, said creator would have
more scope to change the world, as he is not a part of such a system, and
it seems like it would be foolish to try to apply rules derived form
observation within the system to limit what something outside of it can do.

>I maintain that people find what they look for!

I agree with this, but in a different sense.  I have done too many physics
labs to think that any set of measurements that has to be agreed upon is
going to be easy, and thus that people will not do the grueling work of
experimental verification, if they can conjecture, and be thought a great
thinker.

This has the defacto action of invalidating your race in the *current* rules.

fusion weapons (or kkms or... etc etc) aren\'t deemed by "those in power" to be

probably not necessary. It would be a perfect article for a now non-existant
magazine.  There\'s always the Traveller Chronicle...
      Most of the classic stuff is already back in T4.
For all its classicness i prefer d20s by far in my task system, but this is
another issue.

I was referring to Fire Fusion and Steel.  I think plasma and fusion weapons
have a problem like kkms.  Deemed "impossible" when a comprehensive technical
architecture book was constructed and thus not included.  IMO it is.  Maybe an
article or explanation could have and should have been constructed, but thats

I don\'t know the reasons these weren\'t accomidated in (and since) TNE.
Probably just because they couldn\'t be constructed w/ FFS?  I see that someone
has created a barbette and other items...  The problem is that PAWs have
crappy penetration and thus are useless against big ships.

   We\'re getting into murky water here.  It could be argued that strength
and dexterity are *equally* important when handling firearms: dexterity for
aimed shots, strength for automatic weaponry.  As with yen and yang, nothing
is truly pure.  While Dexterity is more important for aimed shots (and for
quick draws), I defy you to present me someone with a strength of 3 and
dexterity of "you pick the number" that can handle a shotgun, SAW or other
high recoil weapon properly.  On the other hand, a gunfighter with
Rambo-like strength little Dexterity will be dead *quick* in a pistol duel
with a highly skilled, dexterous, though average strength person with a
light firearm.

   The solution?  Simplisticity seems to be preferred...

   Solution \'A\': Use Strength for autofire and shotguns, and Dexterity for
everything else.

   Solution \'B\': Add Strength and Dexterity together and divide by two to
get the proper "firearm attribute".

   Solution \'C\': Use Dexterity but include weapon recoil as a modifier which
can itself be reduced or eliminated by higher Strength.  (i.e. Wyatt has a
Dexterity of \'6\' and a handgun skill of \'4\'.  The handgun he attempting to
fire has a single shot recoil of \'3\', and he is attempting to fire four
times.  This yields a recoil modifier of \'12\'.  However, Wyatt has a
Strength of \'A\', which reduces the recoil modifier to \'2\'.  Thus we get: (6
+ 4) - 2 = 8  Wyatt must roll an \'8\' or less on the required number of dice
to hit with each shot.

   Solution \'D\': Similar to \'C\', except that Strength is the controlling
attribute and Dexterity acts as a positive modifier (DEX > 6 : +1,  DEX > 9
: +2,  DEX > 12 : +3  ; alternatively a formula could be used).  Dexterity,
not Strength would also be used to see who draws first in a confrontation.

   Solution \'PC\': Never allow player characters to have firearms, thus
dodging the problem altogether.  Weapons become something that evil NPCs carry.

   Solution \'KIA\': No matter who pulls the trigger or whatever they are
trying to fire, the target is always hit and dies.  This solution also
avoids the problem of keeping track of damage.

   The last two solutions would of course not be the prefered ones, IMHO.  :-)

By jove, you are absolutely correct!

The probability of results for +D-D and 2D6-7 are exactly the same. The
only difference is in what numbers come up on each individual dice.

so Marc\'s nd6+d6-d6 formula can be collapsed down to (n+2)d6-7 and
produce exactly the same curve!

For that matter, nd6+d6-d6 is the same as (n+1)d6-d6

I might have to side with those urging Marc to reconsider this as
unnecessarily complicated...

Wouldn\'t it be easier to re-rate all weapon damage values up one level,
and note in the rules that damage is nd6-d6?

Better yet, just keep damage as it is, for if the damage turns out to be
0 or less, what was the point of the to hit roll? That\'s how it\'s
determined whether damage is applied or not... that\'s where the luck of
just being "grazed" is determined.

Using image s150g.jpg I was able to print in an acceptable manner the B&W
Graphic (Type S Deckplan) scaling to 75% (this cut off the bottom 1/5th,
but all I wanted was deckplan) printing directly from Netscape
(Communicator 4.04) on a Mac to an Apple Laserwriter 16/600 PS.

Thw important thing is that I am able to print the deckplan without an
unreasonable amount of fiddling.

Ideally I should be able to print the whole book smoothly, preferably
without scaling the print size.

The truth is though, even the storyline an theme changed from ruleset to
ruleset -
CT - Mysterious, high adventure (the Ancients, trading, etc...)
MT - Rebellion
TNE - Recovery
T4 - Discovery

If you discard canon, IMHO, you might as well say you have four different
games, and only the first (being the first) should be called Traveller. The
first game set up the universe, the technology, the races. I may be wrong,
but it appears that more material was made for classic Traveller than the
other versions - perhaps even combined. Now this might be the "old-timer" in
me speaking, but would think that an effort should be made so that those of
us who own that material (or are still buying it - a great amount can be
found in used game stores and auctions on the web) don\'t now have a useless
library of paper.

I would even be satisfied (not happy, but satisfied) if a system were
available to convert CT and MT ships, equipment, etc to the new rules. It
has been suggested to make fusion guns circular PAWS in turrets - I\'m not
sure this will work. I tried designing one (assuming that the diameter has
to be less than 4.18 to fit in the socket), and I just couldn\'t get any real
performance.

I agree that I might be overreacting - its been known to happen :) And I
concede that these items that I am concerned about break physics (as we know
it, I will add). That\'s not my point. Like I said above, perhaps we cannot
agree on this (which leaves it in the hands of the publishers, as it has
always been :) ). This is a science fiction game. We need to cater to both
the science and the fiction. I don\'t like the idea (and this is me) that we
can say "We\'re gonna have jump drive (scientifically unsound) and
contra-grav (anyone wanna explain this) but no other departures from
reality. Everything else is gonna be hard sci-fi."

Why is it that you guys can let Jump and CG slide with some handwaves (for
the good of the game, which I agree with), but won\'t even consider trying to
come up with a pseudo-science handwave for these other things? (and yes, I
know I haven\'t offered any possible handwaves - because to be honest, I\'m
not very knowledgable about the science of such things).

I guess we have to agree to disagree. I will continue to support HE, PA
turrets, lower-tech repulsors, KKMs (although I do like the idea of lower
power chemical det lasers - I could be swayed to this as an alternative) and
such in my campaign - and I\'m gonna try to hammer out some ways of dealing
with these items with the new rules. I respect all of your views, and can
not find any real fault with your arguments - its just you (my esteemed
opponents in these debates) place more stock on science than canon, while I
place more on canon than stock. To each his/her own :)

I am not talking about bang, you are at TL-Whatever, but say home world is
TL-10, then you should start out at TL-5, +1 TL every 1 to 10 years until
you are at TL-10.  There are of course many factors that will help & hinder
this.  Like how much support do you get from the homeworld, is the colony
on a "bad" world for the colonists, etc.

Not really, what I am talking about is maybe starting a small city with
surrounding villages & farmalnd type deal & then spreading out.

	Well I use the following rule in my campain. Low recoil weapons like
	lasers, nadlers aso can use the dex as can weapons on bipods, some
	tripod weapons are even on Int or Edu. Firing a weapon can therefore
	depend on dex or on strength. A character who has a better strength
	than dex should carry heavy weapons, if he need, while an agile
	should prefer finer weapons.

	I allways have both skill and characteristic in mind for a UTP.
	And fusion gun/strength is for a hit from the hip, while fusion
	gun/dex from a bipod, and fusion gun/edu is for cleaning and
	maintenance, and last not least together with endurance for carring 
	the beast more than 1 mile. So depending on the UTP the same skill
	can be based on a variety of characteristics - all of them you\'ll
	learn in basic training.

	Back to Liaison: Impressing natives with a fusion gun.

	- based on int : the character fires at heavy wall chrashing 20
	  feet in front of the natives.
	- based on cha : the character holds his gun in an impressing
	  position, e.g. at Cleons birthday parade
	- based on soc : the characters hires a dozend personal securities

It doesn\'t have to.  Arm them with what folks over on the \'tech list have
been calling "Laser Carronades" - that is, non-grav-focus lasers.  At 
reasonable TLs, these can still fire out to useful ranges, but not as long
as the grav-focus lasers.  On the flipside, the "Laser Carronades" have a 
higher efficency (more of the input energy goes into the target) than 
equivalent grav-focussed lasers.

That\'s the problem that we had.  We tried looking for various ways around
it, but couldn\'t find anything that was plausible.  We considered rating
some plasma/fusion weapons at sub-hex ranges for space combat, but it
really wasn\'t useful.

Maybe, though it\'s aparrently not easy.  The rules you\'d need appear to
all be there (or at least enough to see if it\'s feasable).

Marc specifically requested that we not do that, AND, given the time

Even in an high-tech setting like the one proposed by the Traveller gme,
religion will probably have a certain degree of influence on people choices
and general outlook on life. Here I propose my ideas for a "cleric" career
in Traveller and some guidelines for detailing and introducing new
religions, cults and similar organizations.

The Clerical career is presented in a format compatible with the current
edition of Traveller (T4), and based on some similar work which originally
appeared on the Dragon magazine (see bibliography for details).

                            Cleric

Clerics are members of some religious group or organization. More
specifically, they have decided not only to follow the precepts of the
group, but to become both agents for their faith and a living example of
the virtues and standards required by their religion.
Routine Tasks: Spreading the faith, comforting and helping their fellow
believers, administering the rites in accordance with the canon, guiding
and counselling the community they live in.

Rank & Service Skills:
For each term served gain Religion-1 (see below for details).
Rank 2,4,6: +1 _cluster_ skill.

Notes:
_Survival rolls_ are quite easy. This is based on the assumption that most
religions will be already well-integrated in the social scene, and that no
violent opposition exists against the religion chosen by your character.
See the "Detailing Religions" part for more on this.
_Reenlistement and mustering out_ are different from the ones for the other
careers. You usually don\'t "muster out" from a religion, and generally you
are not entitled to retirement pay or pensions when you leave it.
The player and the referee should decide what happens when a PC fails the
reenlistment roll. He may have left the clergy for personal reasons (for
example, he breaks a vow, like celibacy or pacifism). If this happens, he
will deduct 1d3 points from his Social Status, and will not be able to use
his rank or any other benefit associated to membership in the clergy
[unless he somehow fakes his credentials]. Optionally "mustering out" my be
considered like a sort of "extended sabbatical" from the church, and the
character will remain a full member of the clergy. He must still obey to
any order from his church and respect the rites, vows and any other
restriction required by his faith.
_Religion Skill_. It represents the knowledge of rites, laws, traditions,
canon and doctrines of the particular religion you belong to. It may be
used as a positive reaction modifier when dealing with members of the same
faith [or a negative one when confronting enemies of your faith]. Edu is
usually the base for this skill, but sometimes Int may be used to deal with
unfamiliar situations like debating your beliefs with members of other
sects, or performing rites in emergency situations.
_Ranks_. Other have proposed names taken mainly from the Catholic
tradition. Even if many messages were excellent (In particular Pat
Connaughton <pconn@simm.net> posted a very torough treatment of ranks in
the Catholic church). What follows by no means is to be considered as a
I think that basing the rank table on an existing religion is not a very
good idea. For example, the "Exorcist" rank has sense only for a church
which professes the existence of evil spirits or demons. "Father" or
"Brother" make no sense for matriarchal orders and so on.

Even considering so, I urge you to contact the author to
You should work out the name and
number of ranks by carefully considering two different points. The first
is how widespread the religion is. If you religion is limited to a
couple of systems, its organizative structure will be different from an
interstellar church which covers half the Empire.
The other point is the main focus of the religion. If its main concern
is excellence in some worldy pursue (as a proof of divine favour) its rank
will
probably reflect this (Initiate, Master, Grand Master, Teacher and so
on), while a religion which portrays itself like a large family will
use terms which recall a similar structure (new-born, sister, mother,
life-bringer).

Some guidelines on religions.
The "Priest" career I described here is based on the assumption that the
church has existed long enough to obtain some kind of recognition inside
the Imperium. In order to do so, it must be based on fairly benign
concepts: a cult who routinely sacrifices non-members in gruesome rituals
would be surely outlawed and stomped out by the Imperial government. Given
this, you may be free to create as many religions and cults you like, and
could even encourage players to submit their own. Religions should have
some fundamental precept as its major focus, and will tend to encourage its
clergy to gain skills in related areas. When designing a religion, you
should detail a cluster of skills which are related to the religion main
concept. Whenever you get a _cluster_ result during character generation
you must chose a specific skill among these skills, either by dice roll or
player\'s choice. As you can see, this career does not give combat skills.
You may add  weapon skills in the cluster, (brawling, melee, blade and
fencing are the best choices, and could represent the martial arts
traditionally thaught in some sects). If for some reason you decide to
allow extremely war-oriented religions, I\'d suggest to use one of the
existing military careers (for example the Army) for the character
generation, and then add the Religion skill at the end of the process.

Describing a Religion
We dont\' really need an URP, but a brief outline of a religion will prove
useful. You may follow this simple outline:

_Name_: The name of the religious movement.
_Main Focus_: A concise listing of the main ideas and themes of this
belief system.
_Brief History_: Describes how long it existed, and a rough extimate of
the number of followers.
_Reason for Continued existence_: A couple of sentences on why the
religion remains popular.
_Non-humans status_: Covers the general outlook towards non humans or,
in some cases, towards other human races (i.e. Solomani, Zhodani, etc.)
_Wovs_: Restrictions and codes to which followers must adhere. They
_Allies/Enemies_: Groups which would help or hinder a known member of
this religion.
_Skill Cluster_: [see before]
_Rank Names_:(Optional) Names of the ranks.

A couple of examples from the original article by Michael Brown (see
bibliography).


_Name_: The Vekkur.
_Main Focus_: Preserve life and health in all sentient beings.
_Brief History_: The religion takes its name from the vekkur, a mythical
Vlandian creature which spittle (allegedly) cured any disease. Members of
the sect believe that a supreme being exists, and that any sentient being
in the universe has the right to life and well-being. Quite widespread in
the core subsectors, but less frequent in the frontier regions of the
empire.
_Non-humans status_: Anyone can join this religion.
_Reason for Continued existence_: Very popular among doctors. It often
sponsors wide-range health programs on low TL planets. The religion is
quite tolerant of other beliefs, a follower can often be a member of
another cult, provided that this does not clash with the main focus of
Vekkur doctrine.
_Wovs_: Members are true pacifists, and will not take a life under any
circumstance. They always wear some sort of white garment.
_Allies/Enemies_: No known enemy, but the Army and the Navy sometimes show
some suspicion against members of this group and they are closely monitored
during wars. Occasionally, members of the _PanGalactic Friends of Life_
have protested against the order for not caring enough for non-sentient
lifeforms. Sporadic (but recurring) tensions between the church and
pharmaceutical corporations have been recorded in the past.
_Skill Cluster_: Biology, Chemistry, First Aid, Medical, Psychology.

_Religion Name_: Children Transcendant
_Main Focus_: Upholding the use of Psionic
_Brief History_: Many older religions described saints and avatars as being
capable of impossible feats. This common tradition is the proof that
Psionic talent is a step towards an higher plane of existence. Depending on
the historical period, this religion may be officially outlawed in the
Imperium, and members could be forced to hide.
_Non-humans status_: Usually good. Zhodani are especially populars.
_Reason for Continued existence_: Members are required to test out and try
to achieve maximum PSI potential as early as possible. Testing and training
are free, and are administered during the first and subsequent terms (i.e.,
even if the first test fails, the character can take another test later,
with the usual DMs. Note that even non-PSI can still be part of the
clergy).
_Vows_: Strong ethical rules regulates use of the psi-powers. Members
should avoid using them to gain an unfair advantage on "normals".
_Skill Cluster_: Chemistry, Psionicology, Psi-Level, Perception, Medical,
Physics
_Allies/Enemies_: Depending on the historical period, the Imperium may be
considered an enemy: in these cases you should apply a -1 DM on the Injury
roll. Psionical Institutes are usually on very good terms with members of
the church. The same usually holds for Zhodani agents.

Actually, having exhaust in the direction of thrust doesn\'t
mean they necessarily use mass.  Since their physics was
never identified, I can\'t be known if the exhaust was
to expell mass for the effect or was simply a byproduct
of the process.

Let me expand on this.  A ship can carry a displacement ton of freight
and earn kCr 1 on that ton.  Setting aside the space costs nothing, no
maintenance cost is involved, and the ship can rent the space to itself
in order to carry speculative cargo that can earn many times that much.

On the other hand, you can fill that displacement ton with a low berth
that costs kCr 50 to buy, and a couple of hundred credits per trip to
operate.  A low passenger only pays kCr 1, so you\'d be better off with
freight in the space.  There\'s two circumstances where low berths make
sense.  First, if you can get low passengers to fill the space but not
freight; better kCr 0.8 profit than nothing.  Second, if you *can* use 
a low berth for freight or speculative cargo -- hauling livestock, for 
instance.  There aren\'t any rules I know about covering that case, but
there are references to using "livestock low berths" equivalent to the
emergency low berth in both classic Traveller and TNE.

In MT, something similar could be done with low berths: say you\'ve got
a player on Deneb that needs to reach Vland, but you don\'t want to play
out the transit.  With DGP\'s portable low berths, you could carefully 
freeze them at Deneb, and ship them on the xboat route by Tukera liner
to Vland.  Low berth travel is less lethal in MT, but still hazardous
enough that most travelers who can afford it won\'t do this.  It might
be cool if low berth travel starts out very dangerous in Milieu Zero,
and becomes safer in later periods (perhaps remaining dangerous for a
long time on the fringes, where local medical resources are scarcer).

Features:

    8xVehicle Shops
    8xLaboratories
    8xSickbays
Armor: 100
Structure: 59

The ship is a 200,000std cylinder surrounded by 8x100,000std spherical fuel
tanks. The tanks are discarded in sets of 2 as they are depleted, to
increase the acceleration. I\'m not sure how to calculate the total G-hours
and such. Without dropping the tanks, the ship can sustain 1.7G for just
over 35 hours. Each tank masses 173,607tons...

The assumption is that this is enough speed to engage the ramscoop. I\'m not
sure if thats true. But assuming it is, then the ship will constantly
accelerate until its at its maximum speed (which is???). As far as slowing
down is concerned....well, it\'ll have to use its magscoop as a "solar-brake"
and probibly pull some clever orbital mechanics to put it in orbit around
the target star...

Bussards are the way to go - give them a fusion plant and they can scoop
their power plant fuel as well (I handwaved this, but it seemed reasonable).

The electrostatic armor represents a particle shield - designed to vaporize
particles in the path of the ship. I don\'t know if this is reasonable or
not...it seemed like a good idea :)

The ship carries 1000 colonists, each with 10 tons cargo. 8 100ton landers
are provided, as well as 8 1000ton pre-fab colonies - I envision these being
large drop palettes that already have quarters, manufacturing plants,
etc...to "jump-start" the colony. The colonist are supplemented by frozen
embryos, which would be gradually added to the population over several
(maybe hundreds) of generations, to broaden the gene pool. Colonists would
have to raise at least one embryo child (planted in the woman) for each
natural child (natural meaning concieved naturally) born. Single women would
probibly be encouraged to have an embryonic child at the appropriate time,
to make sure that the gene pool was being added to.

The craft has a bank of hydroponic gardens to support life should the crew
need to wake up at any time. upto 40 waking crewmember can be supported at
one time.

So if reality shifts, how many fingers will I have?  How does this relate
to the notion of counting?  Without counting, we can\'t do very much in the
way of symbolic computation.  Assuming that symbolic computation is still
possible after reality shifts, don\'t we need a new basis for counting?

Yes, and if I was insulting you I apologize for my affrontery.  At any
rate, I use mathematics every day as well.  If that fact does not qualify
me to criticize your position, the same description as applied to you may
not qualify you to take that position in the first place, until more
information about what exactly it is we do at work becomes available.  (I
am only a graduate student in CS -- there is plenty about higher theory
that I don\'t know.)

A kinder, gentler way to say this is that this set of perceptions has
taken thousands of years to develop, and brought countless benefits to our
civilization.  The notion of legislating pi to 3.0 implies legislative
interference in an area of primarily technical interest, which can damage
the technocracy.  IMHO, any argument which strengthens the position of
such legislation in common parlance should be decried quickly and loudly
(in common language).

The state was Louisiana.  IIRC, the bill stated something along the lines
that the actual value of pi was too hard to understand.  In reality, it
was probably a procedural trick, like the flower garden vote that comes up
every year in the Texas legislature (although we *do* occasionally find
some real morons in our legislatures).  Somebody else can probably relate
more concrete facts about the case. 

We should mark all components of this thread as off-topic -- the closest
it comes to being Traveller-related is the parlimentary politics that it
relates to.

Just my $0.02.

I agree that it\'s important to have an broaded age range, even if it\'s
0-30. It makes for a better socially adjusted group.

Yow ! 6 kids per female ! Have you ever tried convincing a woman to go
through childbirth 6 times, no matter how long between births. Also, 49 is
pretty old to be having children. I\'d say a more reasonable range might be
20-36 at one child per 4 years, but even that might be pushing it.

Even if there are no accidental deaths, there are bound to be some natural
ones (cancer, disease, childbirth, stroke, etc.) I\'m afraid that I don\'t
have any statistics to generate numbers.

I have to take issue with this.  First, micro$oft did make great 
efforts to have quite a bit of \'compatiblity\' for DOS in win95 
(although I\'m sure the old adage about DOS not shipping until <insert 
application> won\'t run, still holds true).  And the original point 
about everything emulating a DOS environment is valid.

	Take a look on the Djepper Motorbike or the Enfield. The first one

	Or look at the Fortschritt Tractor, it a TL:6 heavy tractor extremly

Of course you\'re right, I wasn\'t thinking of it like that,  In the original
"Low Tech Colony Ship" post, the author (Andrew Atkins, IIRC) spoke of
sending 4,000 t of equipment.  Which even at TL 9 could represent 200 small
factories.  But then would also have to have heavy construction equipment,
ground movers, etc.

This sounds like an excellent idea.  You can usually tell where data came
from in real life.  Why not in the Imperial Archives.  Of course, there

In some cases your humble opion is wrong.  In some cases the storyline

Your post made me sore.  You didn\'t sound very humble.  You sounded snotty!

[I snipped this part of Glenn\'s post so as to keep my quote to original
material count as low as possible, in it he expounded on other related
probability curve phenomina previously unconsidered by him that don\'t
really relate to the remainder of my reply.]

Um, you might want to go back and reread the reply that Marc made just
after (or was it just before) my post (to which you are replying).  I think
that there is a misunderstanding of what he intended.

In fact, why don\'t I repost that so you won\'t have to.

Someone wrote:

[I snipped the rest of Glenn\'s message, because, I think the above
voids his arguments (which Marc already answered), and so I can
say that I quoted less than 50% of the original post (not counting
the reposted material above of course which brings my quoted
material to original count up to about 45% (including my
explanations of these snips.]

You know, I really ought to take out those long explanations of what I
snipped and why.

I really ought to.

Actually, it\'s not valid.  Windows 95 emulates DOS reasonably well,
but I\'ve run into a large number of DOS applications which won\'t work
in Windows 95 and many Windows 95 machines are not setup to boot
into DOS with all resources.  Mac DOS emulators are most likely worse.
The ones I know of are also expensive.  Windows 98 supposedly gets
rid of DOS completely, so compatibility with a DOS shell will most
likely be even less reliable if it even exists...

If you want to be cross-platform, write it in something like Perl,
Python, Java, etc... that has interpreters available on every platform.
Of course, that makes a GUI more difficult.

Marc, 

Like I said, I like the concept of the +/- 5, but I was a little concerned
about the added rolling.  I played around with it this evening and quickly
a question came to mind.

Have you decided to change the way damage is applied?  I *thought* damage
was going to be applied one die at a time to the 3 physcial
characteristics, 

Example

STR 9
DEX 6
END 8

You take 2d damage

You roll a 2 and a 4

And choose to subtract 2 from STR leaving STR 7

and 4 from DEX leaving DEX 2

End Example

With this new method you\'d have had 2d+(+d-d), or roll 2 and 4 then +6-4.
The *total* would be 6+2 or 8, but how could you apply each of the dice to
a characteristic?  Which die does the +2 add to?  Or do you plan to take
the entire roll off one characteristic now?

But what if i have evil PCs?  I do... these guys are sadistic.  They kill
people they get in bar fights w/.  One guy they nailed in the err... groin
area and they decided to do a Lorena Bobbit on him.  They walk into a bar and
throw a guy off a stool they want.  When he fights, they shoot him.  They
start riots.  U know that Hollywood shootout w/ the guys in armor?  They did
that long before that was on tv.  I decided to end it "quick" and pore on some
heat... a bunch of police end up dead. Swat comes out...They even shot down a
police grav vehicle.  I\'m a law and order guy, too.  These guys have short
lives and usually go in a blaze of (in)glory.  One got captured and was
publically executed.  3 more KIA.  1 got away (Most wanted, need i say).
Enough about these sadistic bastards, i\'m way off topic.  ; )  (they are
funny, but can be very annoying when they rip up my adventures)

Richard, please don\'t think we\'re saying that plasma and fusion cannon
don\'t *work* in Traveller. None of us are really saying that. What we\'re
saying is that the velocity of the plasma and fusion pulse is too slow to
hit ships in open space at tens of thousand kilometers, and the ranges of
ship to ship combat have been pushed out to tens to hundreds of thousand
km.

If ship to ship combat ranges are dropped to a few thousand km then the
high energy weapons *would* effective. The original Mayday rules used a one
thousand mile scale, IIRC, and I know Book 2 did, at that scale HE weapons
worked effectively.  OTOH, TNE used a 30,000km scale, HE weapons don\'t work
effectively on that scale.

So, if you want CT style ship weapons, think about CT style combat ranges,
maybe 5 or 10 minute turns with 1 to 2 thousand km hexes. Of course, to get
those short ranges you are going to have to cut the ranges of spinal PAWS,
Meson cannon and lasers.

Alternatively, handwave a gravfocused plasma/fusion pulse. Because these
are massive plasma (rather than massless photons) the pulse is only good
for a few 30kkm hexes, but far enough to make them effective out to 3 or 4
hexes. Effective short range weapons.

First, I am sorry this took so long to get out, but I have the tendancy to
get buzy every time I post on a subject.  The last time it happened it
nearly took 4 months to get back to the list.  In any case, here is some
more of the initial considerations.


More on number of colonists: 
I had made a mistake during the previous post, indicating that the reason
for going to 10000 over a 1000 was viabilty.  The actual reason was based
on survivability.  I am assuming that without a theory of Jump Drives, the
possibilities of having any trade to the colony world would be far from
consideration.  With the Bussards, relativistic effects make trade
difficult, and with slower schemes, travel time makes trade impossible. 
Yes, it may be only a TL 5 colony that is eventually established, but all
the advantages of TL 9 must be used for establishing the colony.  I think
that it would be advantagous to have the extra people available to
establish several colonies around the target world.  One major disaster
could wipe out a colony, having others would increase the chance for a
colony surviving.  How many colonies in the new world vanished without a
trace within a years time?  I know of the Roanoak <sp?> colony, but I\'m
sure there were others.

Surviving, and what is needed:
Clearly, this represents a project of immense proportions.  Consider that
the only thing known about the target world is that it is habitable.  At
lauch time, the entire biosphere  of the target world will be an unknown.  
Determining the ecology and biology of as much of the world will be an
important factor for survival.  First, it would be unreasonable to assume
that anything on the world would be edible.  Thus, it follows that a wide
variety of foodstuffs be brought to the world.  However, there are no
guarantees that any crop can be grown nor any animal can live on this
world.  Consequently, there has to be a large variety of foodstuffs and a
genetics team capable of altering earth organisms for survival on the
world.  An alternative would be to construct greenhouses capable of
growning the earth organisms (it could work, but I havn\'t thought out the
implications of such a plan).

Next, hazards need to be assessed.  I\'ve touched on some of the biological
hazards, but there could be many more.  Hazardous organisms have to be
identified and countermeasures developed.  The possibility also exists for
a whole new set of diseases to be present in the alean biosphere.  Beyond
the purely biological problems,  whether patterns need to be established,
and geologic stability needs to be determined.  Each requiring enough
experts to reasonably assess the issues in question.

Further, building materials need to be aquired.  If it turns out that there
is nothing resembling a tree on the new world, it is clear that another
source of building material needs to be established.  Canabalizing the ship
has been mentioned.  Does anyone have any other ideas?  


I wont make the same mistake twice.  Instead of another post tomorrow, I
will try to continue by the end of the weekend.

Thanks,
Marcus A. Teter

PS-- The discussion is really interesting, and I am getting a ton of new
ideas.  Also, Andrew\'s second vessel is even more impressive than the
first.

Something approaching the speed of light in about 200 days.

The Bussard ramjet will work to slow the ship also.  If you don\'t drop the
tanks, they will be full when you reach your destination.  If you do, since
you don\'t have any internal fuel tankage, your power plant will quit (c. 200
days before you get there) and all your colonist will die.  :-(  So, you
need internal tankage for the power plant at least.

If the mag scoop will garner enough fuel to run the ram jet at 1% of the
speed of light, then as speeds increase, so will the fuel available.  At top
speeds (just under the speed of light), you should be able to scoop 100x the
fuel you need to run the engines.  Fuel for the power plant should not be a
problem.  So, there\'s no need for hand waving.  A minimal fuel purification
plant will eliminate any worry about the quality of fuel.

IMO, it\'s probably not needed.  Your weaponry should be able to eliminate
anything big enough to do you any harm.  OTOH, it probably wouldn\'t hurt
anything.

You could probably eliminate some of this housing mass/volume by using
something like the Survival Tent w/o the survival equipment (see T4 book 1 p
69 & 70, especially the last paragraph).

Unfortunately, this type of life support requires a minimum number of people
be awake and using the life support.  OTOH, with the design you have, the
trip will only take c. 60 weeks (to the colonists point of view, relatively
speaking (time dilation to us, compression to them)), so maybe you should
consider keeping them awake.  If you had them take the Fast drug, they would
only experience 1 week.

One last comment, at TL 10 they could use a HEPlaR drive.  If I were
designing such a ship, I would give it a minimal Bussard ram jet, say 0.1 G,
and a HELPlaR drive, say .9 G (or maybe 1.9 G for emergency maneuvering).
With the Bussard ram scoop to provide the fuel, you could probably cut the
tankage down to...
Let\'s see a HEPlaR drive uses less than 4.5% the fuel to get the same
thrust, so If you were cutting down to .1 G on the Bussard, that would be
1/17 and then if you used a 1.6 G HEPlaR, that would be 4.5% of 16/17.  If
we add those together we get,  0.0588 + .045 x  0.9411 = c. 0.0588 +  0.0424
=  0.1012.  That\'s a little more than 1.  However with the dropped tonnage,
that 1 tank should be enough.

BTW, to calculate the acceleration, I\'ll need more data.  How much do the
tanks weigh empty?

Oh yeah, one last thing, for the design you had, you would be better off
with a close structure hull, it would be cheaper and weigh less.

That all depends on the new paradigm.  I don\'t know, you brought up

Mayday hexes were 300,000km, and combat with lasers went out to as

CT combat was always on the order of light seconds. Military sensors
were listed in Book2 I think as having a range of 1.5 million km
(I\'m very unsure of this one, unlike Mayday of which I am certain).

Spinal MGs were\'t really short ranged, they either didn\'t get a
bonus for long range, or they got one for short, but range wasn\'t
really limited.

Actually, as disgusting as it may sound, a female of any species (including
the human species) is now capable of carrying the young of any species with
the proper attention to internal chemistry.  A human could not carry a horse
or elephant to term and survive the process, but they could carry them to
such a point that existing artificial environments would suffice.

Taking last centuries colonial societies as an example, 15-45 is the norm.
that allows for a reasonable depth of skills and experience in the
colony, you really need the older people too.

That\'s a very late 20th century assumption. My Grandmother had 13 children
(11 of whom survived to adulthood) and families of this size were not
at all uncommon in the first half of this century. Look at family sizes in
the 18th and 19th centuries; women could and did bear very large numbers of
children. The limits are social not biological (a woman can bear a child
every 18 months + or - 15%). When one studies the demographics of transition
from a colonial society to a mature society you will find some very clear
numbers. A colony will start with a very high natural growth rate (6-8%) for
the first and second generations. The rate will then tapper off to between
5-7% for the next three or four generations, dropping to 3-5% for another
few generations, then stablising around 2-3%. One factor to consider is that
colonial societies have *much* clearer gender differentiation than mature
societies (it\'s fairly much enforced by the breading rate) and that children
will be born very rapidly (one per 18 months) and then stop. This is again a
social imperative not a biological one. There is a neccessity to get the
child bearing over quickly to free up an adult, and to reduce the period
with dependent children. E.G. assume six children; one per 6 years means
you have dependent children for 15 (time to effective adulthood) plus 5x6
(the child spacing) which gives you 45 years with dependent children. Now
reduce it to 18 months you get 15+(5x1.5)=22.5 years. You can easily see
the advantage in \'packing\' the child bearing.

>>also I assumed no significant number
>>of accidental deaths among women of child-bearing age (All assumptions
>>open to debate, I know).

Assuming our current medical tech you get a maternal death rate of around
2-3 per 10,000 births and infant mortality of around 7-10 per 10,000 births.
Even if you drop the high intervention births you maybe double those
figures.

Another good reason to pack the child bearing.

(My sincere apologies to all women who read this, I know I\'m reducing women
to baby machines; the thing is in colonial societies, that\'s what they
effectively become)

    'topic' => 'Canon thoughts',
    'body' => 'I think it is important to remember that there are different types
of canon.

There is the canon of background (the most important, IMHO),
and the canon of rules. Systems to create technology, or
starsystems, or whatever fall into the latter. Historically, they
have been only loosely connected. I will use Canon for the
historical version, and canon for techy rules canon.

Take High Guard and CT as an example. We all know that in Traveller
the peace is maintained by squadrons of huge Battleships, or
Battleriders (a priciple source of debate in the Navy). *That* is
canon. HG, on the other hand while frequently refered to as canon,
has optimum military designs that are far from Canon (though closer
to the BR camp than the BB camp)----HG tends to support the smallest
ships you can wrap around a decent meson gun as I recall. Weren\'t
TCS competitions won by computer designs that found this optimum
design stratagy? 

So we have a tech rule set that makes ships that are so much better
than the ships published that it is hard to belive that they would
get made. I would tweak the tech rules in this case.

TNE published the good ole ships we knew and loved, but the design
systems in BL and FF&S made all of them really dumb since they
allowed for *far* superior designs. The obvious example is big
lasers. Again, what is canon? And I\'d say that the ships we know are
Canon, and the tech rules should bend to fit it better.

Take the Low Berth thread of late. The thing that is important (and
was stated on the list) is that LBs be at least safe enough that
they get used! Who the hell would pay a bunch of money for such a
crappy chance to live through the trip? I\'d say that *that* is the
level that LBs need to be looked at----we know they exist, so they
*must* give reasonable value given thousands of years market
pressures. What the survival rolls look like from game version to
game version are less important than whether or not they make sense
in the universe, IMHO.

I\'d say that the text background takes precedence. A bunch of
changes in FFS2 were to make the design system produce results that
are more consistant with Canon. HE weapons got hosed, but all
the parties involved actually really want them, so there is active
work to figure out some way to jazz them up without really wreaking
everything else----all this stuff is tied together. I think that KKMs
are important for just this reason----text background says nukes are
a no-no for civies. Of course being a rock-thrower I\'d retcon the
rules of war to say "weapons of mass destruction" or somesuch :-)

That said, making stuff match reality where ever possible is good
simply because it is a set of assumptions that we know are
internally consistant. Anyway, I think that the above is worth
thinking about when discussing Canon/canon. 

A final note on HE weapons----if you want them and don\'t care that
they don\'t work----MAKE THEM UP :-) The fact that (new) published
designs do have them will make them even stranger weapons...

thoughts on the subject.

1) Jump Drive consume large amounts of Fuel for the energy to perfom a
Jump.

2) If you could store energy in other forms other that fuel would that not
make Jump Drive more Efficent?

3) Why carry large ammounts of fuel if all you do is burn it to make a
jump.  Why not use Solar Cells to collect the energy from the nearest star,
or use another energy storage medium to hold the energy needed.

4) If you use Solar Cells or a another storage medium for the energy, why
not place them in a sperate object rather than a ship.  Say a Jump Gate.

5) If you use Jump Gates, why not place them at all major worlds in the
empire.

6) If you have Jump Gates at all major worlds, then why place Jump Drive on
most cargo ships & liners at all?

7) The only ships that would need Jump Drive would be military, colony, &
free trader type vessels

8) Military & free trader type vessels would only need to use jump drive
when going to systems that are not part of your empire or do not have a
jump gate.

9) Security for Jump Gates would need to be on several levels.  Electronic
& Physical.  Electronic so someone cannot hack into the system & get a free
ride.  Physical so that someone could not destroy the Jump Gate.

10) Jump Gates would be a great place for pirates to hang around.  So you
would need Physical Security to defend ships coming out of a Jump Gate.

11) Once you have captured a system with a jump gate, you can use it to
send more ships deeper into emeny lands.

12) A man could get rich owning a jump gate, so megacorps & governments
could use this a form of revenue.

So far this is what I have.  One of the reasons I posted this is because I
want feedback on this system.  The other is I am planing to run a Babylon 5

Actually with an initial 1000 colonists and 20 million embryos, at TL 10
I\'d think the best option would be to use artificial wombs to rapidly
increase the population.  You could institute a law that every family must
raise at least one artificially grown child (or perhaps one for every
natural child raised), which would be a whole lot easier on the population
than forcing the women to bear children until they dropped, and would also
grow the population more rapidly. 

In MT at least, artificial womb technology existed at TL 10, and you could
even grow the kids at 10x the normal speed, so they would only have to be
in the things for 27 days.

The Caravel epecially is making me re-assess what freight rates should be

tons of cargo *and* 20 passengers just blows me away. This is *cheaper*
than some 200 dton Far Trader designs, and carries their total displacement
in freight. The Engineering Shop and sickbay make the ship, with a little
extra armament, suitable for long-distance trade missions well outside
Imperial Space. Only one question - the text says it has a Heplar engine,
but the tech details say Thrusters. Which is correct ?

I like the Ritestar II for it\'s atmospheric armament (do G+A want to sublet
a small contract to FS\' Hi-Energy Solution\'s Division for an atmospheric
particle accelerator or a rapid-fire fusion gun ?), and the extra G and
sandcaster make it quite a bit more survivable.

Something tells me that some Ritestar IIs have 40 ships troops and a couple
of Grav APCs and atmospheric fighters crammed into the passenger cabins and
cargo hold and are used as Vargr Corsairs, raiding throughout and beyond
the Vargr Extents.

Like I said, I\'m blown away.

The reason is that while the mainworld may be the most important world in

industrial or non-ag mainworld, can be pretty important as well.

It\'s a big issue in PE as well - it\'s a lot cheaper to colonise and uplift
a world in the same system. Population transfer should be easier as well.

It also provides adventuring opportunities for starship-less adventurers -
it is conceivable that a group of PCs could pool their cash and buy an
insystem ship, and go surveying or colonising or whatever.

Finally, when Second Survey is done, serious thought should go to issueing
it on disk or CD-ROM.

If low passage is taken from the Dumarest series (I always assumed so) then
the low berths are in the free trader\'s hold and are intended for shipping

It seems reasonable to me that a berth in a sickbay designed to preserve

Put it in the extended data set (as posted by Marc) as a single (hex) code
eg M0 is 0, etc and expand as new milieus arise. This removes the problem
of linking to the dating system and adding in a -tve for Milieus prior to
M0. I mean, an Ancients set would otherwise be -200000!

Also, I\'d argue for adding in the space for the economics extension from
Pocket Empires.

This would invalidate every weapon design as published (ie FFS2 and EA and
CSC). I agree it\'s simpler but it messes with the existing published
material... and with some of the better material at that.

I can see a need for better low end resolution for the damage, but have the
feeling that the +1D/-1D would be unwieldy. But as someone else said, I
haven\'t tried this one with my players yet (unlike the new task system
which went really well). I may well ignore it. I know that I would be
really irritated as a player if I hit someone and then ended up with 0
damage.

for the really cautious, I would suggest designing the ship so that once in
orbit it can be converted to an extended large animal ecosystem.
That way you can leave some colonists and animals and plants on the ship
where they could survive any problems with your chosen colony sites.

If your planet does not have artifical womb technology, risking losing an
irreplaceable herd (or all your colonists) to an unexpected biological
problemwould seem silly when you have a prefectly good isolated "greenhouse"
in orbit.

ps
someone commented unfavourably about the "6 children per female" idea.

Multiple children per family and child bearing before twenty is not totally
unheared of :-)
Indeed, if you don\'t have artificial womb technology, accepting multiple
children would (IMHO) be part of the deal that gets you on the trip.
(The same deal that has more women than men in the first generation).

On a high tech, hi pop world, freedom of choice over childberth
might be one of the reasons for going.

IMHO, totally unnecessary. What I think I see here is having to roll a set
of dice to see how many dice I have to roll for damage, which seems
pointless. So every time someone takes damage someone has to roll an extra
set of dice? Is that really what\'s being said, or have I misunderstood?

My affection for CT (and by CT I mean the original three black books!) is
largely based on the clean simplicity of the system, and I hope to see at
least an option for that level of detail in T4.1. This rule doesn\'t look
like it\'s going that way, unless I misunderstand it.

What I meant to say, and failed to say, was that the historical outline is
the only thing IMHO that is canon. The theme is part of what makes the
four versions different just as you say, but that has in my view nothing
to do with canon.

I think what you want is that the old CT should still be continued. I
think that the only way that is going to happen is that you yourself make
new supplements for it. My argument for this is simply that it is easier
for IG and the writers to tweak the rules so that they are in line with
what most people see as physically reasonable, than to go back and be
consistant with all prepublished material. To do this with the technical
stuff is almost impossible and surely not economical feasible. To stay
true to the historical *canon* is much simpler and IMHO what should be
done.

Why is it a useless library of paper? I is what you make it. You want to
use plasma/fusion guns, just use the rules from CT. You want to use HEPlaR
instead of thruster plates do so. You want to use TNE version of fuel
consumption do so. These are just IMHO nittipicky rules that really
doesn\'t change anything of the historical background, which really is the
important part.

Why not just make up rules for fusion guns. Just say that this is the way
it works in your campaign. You want a CT-style campaign go right ahead.
I still swear by a TNE approach myself, and there is nothing wrong with
that. 

We must just be aware that IG is in it for the money and nothing else.
There is no fandom there pushing them to go the extra mile just so that
Traveller stays the best game there is. So they have to take the easy way
out, and it is I think easier to check a physics book and make rules that
to the writer is logical than consulting thousands of out-of-print books
and making sure that the new rules dosn\'t brake anything therein.

I think you have to look at it from the writer point of view. They have
(generally) not been playing the game for twenty-odd years. They don\'t
know by heart every edition and version of the game. They propably don\'t
even have access to all the material published, as many on this list do.
If I write an article for JTAS on Traveller, and I own only some TNE and
T4 stuff it is much easier for me to have rules that are physcally
reasonable to work with. CG and Jump is something that is taken away
violates the hole historical background, a sin that is much worse than the
removal of fusion guns.

Simply beacuse it isn\'t worth the hassle. No know Science Fiction show
uses Plasma/Fusion guns, or KKM for that matter. Its all laserlike
graphics. If you want to sell a game to youngsters today the game has to
have a ST, B5, Star Wars flauver, and then fusion guns uneassecary. The
game is unfortuanlly not targeted for the old fans, but at the teenagers
out there.

And more power to you for it. Just make up rules for it all, post it here
and I\'m sure ten people will pick them up and use them (although twenty
might scream out that it is unscientiffical). That people use it is what
counts in the long run.

Wasn\'t that 300 000 km hex scale? I lost the rules to Mayday but I seem to
remember the figure (we thought it WAY too long back then) and also
remember that Mayday had 1 hex planets to scoot around with gravity and
all.

Starships had 1 inch = 1000 km or something. But in Starships you could hit
a ship VERY far out. I\'ll look at 1st ed LBB when I get home.

columns 1..4 (location), which is used as an index.

Other columns will add extended economic data, WBH data, and other things (a
timestamp is a good idea).

I\'m also leaning towards a sector \'header\', containing route, border and
other sector details.

As it stands, whatever format is settled upon, I should be able to modify
TRTOOLS to handle it with relatively little effort (new LOAD and WRITE

No it is not. Measuring a system means perturbing it and that\'s a
scientific fact. Wether it has to be a consciousness doing it or not
depends on your Quantum Mechanics interpretation which you are free to
choose. Karl Poppers version more or less says what you say but QM
interpretations are unprovable and therefore metaphysics which equals
religion.

Hmm.  That Can-O\'-Worms again huh?  OK, well, I\'ll accept that as 
being about as true as any scientific theory can be (i.e. it\'s useful 
as a working hypothesis and we haven\'t found anything better).

Now then, how about discussing the implications?  Who or what has to 
perceive an event to count as an \'observer\'?  A consciousness?  What 
defines a consciousness?  Can observing be second hand?  Can any 
observing done by a \'consciousness\' be anything _other_ than second 
hand, given the quantum nature of the universe?  If nothing is 
happening when you\'re not looking, how does it know what\'s supposed 
to be happening when you do look?  And what is _it_, the mysterious 
thing that isn\'t there when you\'re not looking but manages to keep 
score anyway?

And why does my head hurt?

This wouldn\'t really solve much.  You would still be rolling one set of
dice, and then rolling a second set of dice (using a different method of
reading them other than simply adding them up) and comparing it to the
first batch.

10 minutes doesn\'t model too well for an RPG, unless you want to get really
technical.  Our idea had characters suffering normal stat degradation to
the three physical stats, with additional damage being applied to INT once
the physical stats were all zeroed out.  I guess additional losses to INT
could be played out per minute instead of per combat round.

OK, here\'s another quick question:  Is the physical damage due to exposure
to a vacuum likely to take much longer to recover from compared to a normal
Traveller character reduced to 000xxx?

Whew!  That\'s a relief!  It coulda got ugly (where\'s Kenneth?).

I\'d say include it as an optional rule, IMHO.  It is still rather awkward
to use compared to the old method...

Old method: Roll a number of dice and add them together

New method: Roll a number of dice and add them together,
            Then roll two additional dice (+D -D) and work out the result,
           *Then* subtract the result of the "+D -D" from the total of the
               first batch of dice

That\'s an extra two steps.

I don\'t think Andrew is trying to compromise the system at all (although I
can\'t speak out whether he likes it or not).  What I believe he is saying
is that the damage system would work equally well with or without the "+D
- -D" rule so why not make it an-- albeit, possibly quite popular-- optional
rule?  As optional rules go, it works extremely well because the system
doesn\'t suffer without it.

Some TMLers may very well mean what you say: "I don\'t like it.  Don\'t
include it."   But for people like Andrew, it may simply mean "I\'m not sure
whether I like it or not, but please write T4.1 so that I can choose
between using the rule or not  when I finally *do* make up my mind :)"

As far as I understand "all" of the fuel is not burned to start a jump.  A
large quantitiy is used to open the jump field, but that field needs to be
maintained through the entire jump.
Now, here\'s an idea to help... first, you have to be able to have Jump Gate
transfer the jump field from itself to the ship passing through. Second, you
have to be able to maintain the jump field. So, keep the jump drive and add
a device to be able to use the jump field produced by the gate. You won\'t
need nearly as muc fuel, but you would still need the drive. Another
thought, keep the fuel tanks. Convert them to cargo holds, but make it so
they could be sealed and used for fuel. This would allow the ship to be
capable of independent jump.

I think the jump gates would have to be controlled. Either by corporations
or government.
I can see a toll being charged to use the jump gate. Since you will probably
make more money from increased cargo.

Um actually, B5 makes quite extensive use of plasma guns (PPGs). Most of
the small craft weapons (the pulse weapons) are PPGs.

Of course, they fight at spitting distance on such shows. High energy
weapons (of CT)  would be really effective at the distances depicted on
such programs. All the Trave weapons would. And they would never miss.
Ever. If anything, the long distance combat used in the more recent

Perhaps a simple logarithmic notation.  Something like:
code

0                0 to 3 years
1                3 to 7 years

3              20 to 55 years
4              55 to 148 years
5            148 to 403 years
6            403 to 1,097 years
7         1,097 to 2,981 years
8         2,981 to 8,103 years
9         8,103 to 22,026 years
A      22,026 to 59,874 years
B      59,874 to 162,755 years
C    162,755 to 442,413 years
D    442,413 to 1,202,604 years
E 1,202,604 to 3,269,017 years
F 3,269,017 to 8,886,111 years

This single hexadecimal # would give us a time scale beyond anyone\'s

There is a standard nD for weapon damage... that is to say, a sword does 2D
damage (for example). But does that guarantee that the sword\'s damage is
always between 2 and 12? Is that the most (or the least that it can do?)

I think that there is a strong argument that a sword swing (or other weapon
damage) even at this point in the process (after the fact of hitting has been
determined) the damage could still be "just a nick" or "wow! what a hit!"

Frankly, here\'s how it plays out with the players:

You swing, and hit the thug. Your sword does 2D damage. Roll 2D. But before
you do, you should know that there is some variation in the damage a sword can
do. On average, that variation averages out to zero. So I guess it really
doesn\'t matter.

Oh, you mean I could do even more damage?

Yes, or less... depending on...

(alt 1) No way I\'ll take less damage. Forget it.

(alt 2) Sure, I\'ll try it.

etc.

Continued example...

So he rolls 7 for sword hit damage. Then he rolls for variance +D -D and comes
up zero 16% of the time. But he could transform that 7 into anything from 2 to
12.

In colonial settings large families are quite common.  I was thinking that
an inital ratio of 1 man 4 women and perhaps thier children (if any).  If
the women carried 2 or 3 of the unborn colonists at a time, they could
reduce the time to full population by that much more.  I know there will be
a slighly higher danger factor, but for TL 10, that should not be much.

[I\'m not going to snip anything more, as I wasn\'t talking about the task
roll at all, but about the damage roll, so I will reiterate my point
now. I\'ve added enough material to more than double the original post
length, exceeding normal requirements for TML text padding.]

As you pointed out, +D-D is the same as 2d-7. Which means that _damage_
rolls equal to or less than zero are now possible. (I ask again,
rhetorically, why is there a to-hit roll?) More randomness is added to
the game, at little benefit. More complexity is added, and I don\'t see
the point.

Maybe somebody else does... Wouldn\'t it be more appropriate to simulate
additional or less damage in the *task roll*?

Critical success: Add d6 (or maybe d3) damage
Barely hit (within 1 of target number): Subtract d6 (or d3?) damage

I just don\'t like rules that add more complexity for little or no gain.
I would encourage Marc to make the rule +D-D rule optional, if it is
published at all.

If better low end resolution is required, why not just introduce weapons
with damage ratings such as the following? (roughly ascending):

dice rolled:      d3-d3    d3     d6-d6     d6-d3      d6
Damage value:     0.5-     0.5     1-1        1-        1

Or something to that effect...

I still don\'t see the point of rolling extra dice just to randomize
further a damage value that is already random. Or am *I* missing
something...

You could aways make some data up. Seriously.  A Plasma MOunt takes
up half a turret\'s worth of volume, and does whatever damage at
whatever range you want. Improve it a little with TL, then more with
Fusion. Done. 

I\'m not trying to give a flip answer, either. The folks that worked
on FFS2 wanted a grounding in reality and HE weapons couldn\'t pass
the disbelief filters. If they would have had to be made up in FFS2
you could just as well do it yourself. I suppose people could just
agree on somebody\'s made up HE weapons and say it\'s a conversion to
CT.

It\'s just a good idea because it makes it easier to keep track of
what can happen. It\'s a "change as few variables at a time" thing.

Besides, while j-drive is complete fantasy, plasma exists, as does
coherent light, and particle accelerators.

Many were talked about for HE weapons. I personally wanted to get
some rules for direct powered HE weapons for things like fighters to
carry. Riding a so armed fighter into combat wouldn\'t be healthy
though since you\'d have to get bloody close by traveller range
standards.

See my canon post, I take the historical canon first, then the rules
sets second. At least not too many ships required HE weapons in CT.
Sure, they had them, but it wasn\'t a "all these guys use is plasma
weapons" kinda thing. One problem with HE weapons in a system like
FFS2 is that once you can make a ship-sized weapon, you need to
consider limitations to its use. HE weapons aren\'t spinal mounts in
canon, for example, but easily could be in design rules to make them
(tweaked so they have some kind of reasonable range) from the ground
up. There would have to be some limit like the DE limit on lasers or
else you\'d go from no HE weapons to super HE weapons :-)

Ok, how about this:  add 1D to the normal damage roll, add them up, then
roll 1D that you subtract.

Why not just subtract n-1 from each nD roll?

So a 2D roll would be 2D-1, and 3D is 3D-2, and so forth.

The idea is that it gives a range that starts at 1 point of damage
(which is what you are after if a hit has already been determined to
happen). A nick that does less than 1 point is a miss.

(sorry if anybody already posted this idea, this is the first I\'ve
really looked at this thread)

According to current (T4 and IIRC CT) technobabble, you don\'t burn any of
the fuel, it is used to create and maintain the "real-space" "jump bubble".

I don\'t have the T4 stuff, I play MT. MT is a little different the CT as far
as how the Jump Drives work. At least that\'s what I remember. I don\'t recall
reading anywhere (Keep in mind I only have MT and books 0-3 of CT) about how
much and when the fuel is used at what time.

Jump gates came from the original posted idea from Legate. I don\'t watch
Bab5, so I don\'t totally know what the jump gates Intale. I don\'t believe
there are any books out on the subject.

I agree with your intention, Marc, but not the implementation.

The additional complexity of adding one die, subtracting another, is a
bit much for a damage roll. Wouldn\'t it be more appropriate to simulate
the "wow! what a hit" or "just a nick" in the *task roll*?

The person attacking then knows by his task roll whether he has made a
great hit, or just a nick, and only *one* extra die need be rolled.

Critical success: +d6 damage
Just a nick (within 1 point of task roll, or some other easily figured
criteria): -d6

(or d3, for both or either of above)


Just a humble suggestion, ;-)

I don\'t see the inclusion of Jump Gates as anti-canon.  Then again, I don\'t
have any problems with Fusion+ either.

Because, if you have a pulse travelling at a few tens of km/s - aboutt
the most you can expect from a plasma weapon as described - it is *never*
going to hit a spacecraft at more than a few thousand kilometers. *Never*.
By the time the pulse gets there the target will have evaded kilometers
from its predicted position.

You can suggest that fusion guns (in particular) have pulses travelling
at thousands of km/s, but then you end up with a very different weapon - 
almost no mass in the pulse, for a given energy, for example, so no "splash"
or any of the classic effects.

For those who miss them - one possibility (at TL-13+) is short-ranged
non-grav-focus x-ray lsaers; which can be pretty nasty. 

(And I\'m still thinking about rules for the "fast" fusion pulse...)

I would still encourage Java work.  There are an awful lot of JVMs out
there, and it has at least the promise of letting you do a GUI that looks
right to all of your software users.  There are speed issues, and
availability issues, but I have so far been able to run identical Java 1.1
code on my Linux box under X, my Win p5 PC at work, and my Mac at home, and
all of them looked acceptable.

Starship Troopers has plasma weapons ;-)
Babylon 5 uses plasma weapons (Earthforce Sourcebook pg80 describes Pulse
Batteries as such).

Albeit not a Sci-Fi show, KK weapons were extensive shown in the late
80s/early90s in the graphic animations for SDI.

You start out a thread and then others add stuff that doesn\'t relate and the
next thing you know, it\'s not about what you wanted to talk about.  :-)  My
original point in pointing out that +D-D = +2D-7 was exactly what your
tables showed.  Marc said that +2D-7 wasn\'t as intuitive, but I think he\'s
wrong.  The curves are the same, and to me I think +2D-7 is quite
illustrative of the point.  If I offended you personally, I am sorry.  That
was not my intent.  My intent was to get the thread back to what it was
about when you started it.  The way the proposed new damage system will
work.

BTW, FWIIW, I agree with you, there is little to be gained by the system
Marc advocated.  If it is incorporated, I will not use it.  I liked your
suggestion of a critical hit/oops system.  It makes more sense (that is it
is more intuitive).  Although, I think a critical with a FGMP should do more
extra damage that a critical with a knife, so just adding +D or +1/2D is
probably not the answer I will use in my campaign.

chances are you can pick them up cheap this way.

I\'ve got two listings:

Marc Miller\'s Traveller signed hardcover at:

http://iguana.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5128603

And a set of books including Milieu 0, Psionic Institutes, Fire, Fusion and

http://komodo.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5129325

If you pick the set up at or near the minimum bid, you\'ll get all five
books at somewhere between $8-10 per book.

Happy bidding!

Yes, however keep in mind that it has to be dumped into the jump grid at a
fairly rapid rate, and storage mediums other than fuel tend to be quite
bulky.

This could take quite a while to accumulate, and you still have the storage
problem.

As I understand it, the jump grid must be imbedded in, and surrounding,
the object which is actually jumping; not in something else.

I don\'t think these would work for the reasons above.

I think that the rest of the post is reduced to an intellectual exercise
unless you wish to allow for something like this in your own universe. This
actually smacks of Fading Suns...

Well, if you haven\'t read the TNE books, Regency Sourcebook and Survival
Margin, that\'s where the most clues are available. There\'s a lot of
information there, most of it must be read between the lines.

For some speculation, I invite you to visit my TNE Conspiracy Theories page

mysteries. My page is at:

Ahh. I see now. Thank you, Mr. Lindsay, for reiterating the rule in
question (I missed the original post, just rejoining the list).

My opinion (I assume that is why it was posted to the list, for our
opinions. If not, I apologize to Mr. Miller, and will shut up in the
future): I wouldn\'t use this rule. It complicates matters, without adding
much to the game. First of all, I don\'t see how it\'s different than just
adding one die to the original number of dice and the subtracting one die
from *that* total. Secondly, I assume that this is meant to give damage
results of 0 or less. I don\'t like that -- if a weapon hits, it should do
damage. How a character is affected by the damage is more of an END task, I
would think. (To ignore piddling damage, END, Difficult) :-)

I dunno. Personally, I like damage that is somehow related to the hit task
(so that the better you hit, the more damage you do). Of course, that has
nothing to do with Traveller. :-)

Something like this would be my preferred option (although I\'m not sure about 
accuracy being affected by shots you haven\'t fired yet...IMHO it should be 10 
for the first three and 8 for the last).

Uhhh...the woman who couldn\'t be convinced that having a large family is
good won\'t be selected to go. The preferred age spread and birth frequency
are _very_ temporal things in any culture, and a colony is going to be
composed of people who want large families.

I changed the following:
    By lowering the thrust, I got more G-hours...makes sense :) The end
result is, of course, the same.
    Added probe craft
    Upped the life support and quarters from 40 people to 600 - 200 in small
staterooms and 400 in dual-occupancy large staterooms (married couples).
    Upped the low berths to 4000.
    Added "bunks" for the "crew" - robots. These bunks represent the work
areas and storage areas.
    Reduced cargo to 8000tons - 2 tons per colonist. That should be
sufficient, since the colony palettes would have a great deal of material on
them.
    Placed the colony palettes in jettison bays to save volume - since they
are one-shot drop units.
    Added a small purifcation plant to purify the fusion plant fuel.
    Gave the fusion plant a small (4 yr) internal fuel supply, to use when
the scoops are off.
    Added a backup power plant.

I discarded the idea of drop tanks - since then it\'ll have fuel to
decelerate at the other end. Thus, its speed in fusion rocket mode is:

    1.0G x 9.81m/s x 3600s x 103.3hr = 3,648,142m/s, or around 1.2% the
speed of light. That should be fast enough to kick in the ramscoop.

Won\'t there need to be a notation for the "baseline" date, though?  Because
time is continually advancing. What if u find an old star chart?  time in the
top left corner?   : ) Of course it could always be "FS" and "SS" for First
Survey and Second Survey.

Sounds pretty good otherwise.

Not just for teh jump.  FFS2 says that the hydrogen is used to make a jump

You need to make and maintain a  "jump bubble."  See above. : )

TNEs FFS had stargates and other more appropriate things, if u can find it.
If u can\'t i might be able to scrounge one up and send it to u.

MT?  Hmm...  I\'d suggest the Babylon Project but that might not be an option
(the Earth Force Sourcebook is very good...  damn... i have no intentions of
using it but its very good to have for a B5 fan).  The ship combat is a bit
too simple for my tastes but it is vector based (for reaction drives).  Grav
drives used by the Minbari up can transfer their momentum into course
changes... kinda like aerodynamics.
    But if u want to stick to MT...  i\'d recomment TNE\'s Fire Fusion and Steel
(and TNE! ; ) ).  The Alternate tech has keyhole drives (for jump points) and
subspace (for B5 Hyperspace).  B5s hyperspace is a fluid medium (and is pretty
weird... like Star Control 2\'s hyperspace.  I like it) not the static
traveller "jumpspace." 
    If u want to make these ships and have Microsloth Excel, u might want to
try a rather excellent spreadsheet that can include all of these exotic ftl
drives (including stutterwarp) and even w/ spin capsule hulls, (the EA Omega
Destroyers), spun hulls (B5 itself) and many other goodies.

Actually... did anyone figure out how to make BRs that work?  Anyway around

like BRs went inside huge hangers, but that would make a damned big tender,
no?  I know other places contradict this in pictures...

And if someone gets some BRs and BBs made, we need to fight a lil (more than a

Well the whole problem comes that CT didn\'t have a comprehensive "technical
architecture manual." The old ships might not make sense.  TNE Came around and
tried to do this.  There were some hard decisions to make.  The old ships were
just put in to be that... representations of the old ships.  They probably had
a choice on to redesign and just keep the names (being "good" designs) or keep
them as close to *historically* canon as possible, whether that made sense or
not.  Of course, since alot of the old weapons were history, they should have
redesigned, IMO, but I wasn\'t there and am probably missing something.    
T4 is here and has avoided the problem by backtracking 1200 years.

   Why should missles be anything but no-no for civies?  Just because its
canon?  I\'d hesitate to say that.  Maybe for Corps and Megacorps but not for
your average Joe Freetrader.  Giving Joe Freetrader KKMs means he can really
screw up his competitors and a yacht or luxury liner but any military ship
will laugh at him.  Who in their right Mercantile 3I mind is going to allow a
"Free Trader Buster" or "Civvie Killer?"  : )  Maybe for use against (or by)
"pirates," but then this will really sidetrack.

Well this can be a problem for some people.  Me...  i don\'t like em, so their
absense doesn\'t bother me in the slightest.  I know there are those who do,
though.  I should think its perfect material for a magazine article but it\'s
appropriateness in a rule book is dubious, to me, especially if space is
limited.

Stop! Wait! Hold it!

The era of the survey has no place in the UWPs of individual worlds.
Within a given database (or list, which is basically a database) there must
be consistency as to what era the data covers.  I have seen a couple of
examples of more than one era (TNE and 1107) in one table and it\'s quite
confusing.

No.  I advocate no mixing of eras within a listing, therefore the entire
listing has an "Era Code" or the era integrated into the title/intro/page
header.

It\'s also a fact that every time you change the UWP format there are a
bunch of sector files that are no longer current (which really doesn\'t
matter until someone writes a program using the "standard" sector file
format).  Change this format only when there is a *real* need.
