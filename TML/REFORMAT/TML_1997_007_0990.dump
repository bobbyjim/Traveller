PBEM game starting May 1 based on the idea of a ISS rescue service.
Players will be either scout personell assigned to rescue boat duty, or
base personel with more minor roles in the story.  Titled "Beltwatch", the
game will be lighthearted and heroic in orientation, with standard
Traveller mechanics.  It is set in Millue 0.

  So far, I have two players: a pilot and an engineer.  I still would like
to have a medical officer and a sensor and communications operator.  For
those interested in a more minor role, any other sort of character is
appropriate, as long as you might live on a starbase.  I also welcome
kibitzers - I\'ll be happy to put you on my mailing list even if you don\'t
want to play.

  Please contact me ASAP so I can get the ball rolling - feel free to post
this message to other mailing lists or on web sites.  Look forward to
hearing from you!

    'body' => '  For all its limitations, I rather like QSDS - I can do a design now in
less than an hour, even with a complicated ship, and that makes it fun to
try things on the spur of the moment.  Anyway, that\'s why I decided to
design an Imperial Yacht. 

  First, some justifications.  The ship is not armed (aside form a Meson
Screen) since it is a diplomatic vessal that comes in peace on state
visits.  Plus, it is escorted by big honking combat ships when it travels,
so it does not carry weapons so as to leave more space for luxury
appointments.  The ship usues a standard hull since Cleon is in favor of
trade and wanted to encourage the Sylea Industry Norm (SIN) way of
building ships.  Thus, the components of the ship act as a travelling
advertisement for Sylean and so Imperial Industry.  Moreover, he could
then order the different components from different manufacturers and so
spread the Imperial Favor around to more folks.

  Anyway, here\'s the design:


Imperial Yacht "Imperia" (QSDS)

Tons: 5000 STD (Wedge U)	Cost: 2697.6 MCr
Crew: 150	High/Mid Pass: 20/40	Low: 4
Cargo: 200 STD		Controls: Military	TL: 12

09 Size				3 Jump (1500 STD/30 Pc Fuel)
				4 Manuever (Thrust Plate)
				3x 3000 MW power plant
				1600 Fuel
				8 Meson Screen
				0 Sandcasters
1x 100T Spacious Hanger		0 Nuclear Damper
5x 100T Docking Ring		A16 P5 J16
				20 Armor, 28 Structure

Crew:	14 Engineers, 4 Electronics, 4 Manuever, 2 Screens, 
	10 Aux Craft, 40 Marines, 23 Command, 50 Stewards
	10 Medical


  The Yacht has a 40T imperial suite for His Majesty, ten 8T double
staterooms for his advisors and Imperial officials, and ten 4T and forty
2T staterooms for other members of the Imperial Household.  In addition,
there is a 300T Hall that serves as a formal recption and dining area, and
a 100T Hall that is an informal reception area and game room.

  The crew is housed in one 8T double Suite (the Captain), six 4T
staterooms (the First Officer, Marine Commander, Chief Steward, Chief
Engineer, Senior Medical Officer, and Chief Pilot), sixty-two 2T
staterooms (remaining command personel, and all operations crew), and
ninety bunks (Marines and stewards).  The operational crew is oversized,
with double the required number of engineers, manuever crew, and
electronics slots - this allows smooth operation in case of illness or
accident.  The large number of stewards ensure the comfort of the
passengers, and the Marines provide security.  In port, all non-senior
crew participate in entertainment and dining events, acting as assistant  
stewards under the supervision of the Chief Steward when they are not
needed for ship operations.

  The ship carries five 100T auxileries, which are publicly described as
M2 capable refueling craft based on the SIN standard Wedge Airframe hull
(see QSDS rules).  In fact, one or more of the five auxilery craft are J3
M6 fully capable spacecraft that can be used to ferry the Emperor to
secret meetings.  A total of six craft can be carried - however, normally
only five are along to allow the hanger to be used for maintnence or as a
docking port for visiting dignetaries.  The price of these aux vehicles is
not included in the above price (mostly because I have not gotten around
to designing them yet).

  The yacht is equiped with military-grade sensors, a large engineering
shop (12T), a vehicle shop, a ten-bed sickbay, and a fuel purification
system (normally not used since the ship travels to populated planets
with starports).  The ship can operate all systems and make M1 with only
one of the three 3,000 MW power plants operating; it can make M3 with only
two on line.  This redundency is intended to ensure the safety of the
Imperial family.

  Again, I am interested in comments - hope you find this ship useful in
your game.

I can tell you that based on our technology today why IR are inferior
missiles.  First of all they are completely Line of sight (LOS) only,
and
this is a major problem for ground based missiles.  And although we are
improving the ability to filter out most decoys, it is still pretty easy
to
fool an IR missile.  They are very susceptable to sun glint off of just
about
anything, including clouds. Once the lock is broken it has to be
manually
reaquired.  There aren\'t many air-to-air missiles that I can think of
that
are effective in todays arsenal.
<<<<

Um, sorry. I have to disagree.  Most of the new AIM-9 missiles are VERY
effective. The US has improved the logic and processing, not to mention
the IR resolution, to such a level that it is very unlikely for the
missile to miss. 

Most of the stats are classified, but if I remember correctly, the AIM-9
can pull 40+ G\'s in a turn and "bends" in the middle to help its
agility. They are *all* aspect (you no longer have to be in the rear arc
for firing), and are very difficult to fool with most decoys.  

If you have a radar track, you can slave the seeker head to that track,
and send the missile down the beam. It will detect and lock on to the
plane when it gets in range. This does make friendly pilots nervous as
it is still *dumb* and can lock onto anyone.

I have to agree, using IR for space combat seems the way to go for
missiles. Judging from the other notes it is very difficult to mask your
heat in space.

Which brings me to my question: Could a TL 12 - 15 ship approach earth
in todays environment without being detected?

If so, How?

I\'m currently going through gear-head sensory overload, so this week 
we\'ll be chatting about Character Development.  Come chat with the 
group about what makes a good character, what kind of details do you 
think out in advance, and how does your character seem to grow as you 
play them.

This may be at least partially a repeat topic, but we have a wider 
audience of attendees now and the topic has been requested, so I\'m 
going for it.

I\'d love to lead the discussion, but I live in a state that doesn\'t 
change time zones so I can\'t make an 8pm EST start time and I\'m 
hesitant to change it to a 9pm EST start time without due notice or 
consideration.  Any thoughts?

So, we\'ll be meeting at 8pm EST on Thursday, on IG\'s server, 
www.imperiumgames.com, port 6665 or 6666.  

I look forward to seeing everyone there!  Oh, and come prepared to 
request further topics!

I agree with you that this is a wonderful act of creativity on the part of the
player, and should be rewarded. But all the examples/complaints up to this
have been of the "Well, if we allow that my players will use it to create 
perpetual motion machines/super weapons/fighters that can beat capital
ships" <g> and I call that munchkineering IMHO.

But this happens all the time, anyway! A good 75% of the sessions I run go
into "GM hell" sooner or later due to the actions of some very intelligent 
and creative players of mine. And that\'s with the *standard* rules. I seriously
cannot see the addition of a "physics breaker" rule changing the percentage
of games that they "break" through creativity. And as for your (good} example,
how is this any different from the 
(fairly) recent account of a game someone (sorry if I forgot who) was 
running where he had a nice scenario much like yours w/ low-TL sentient
geneered rats, and one of the characters quite unexpectedly committed 
mass xenocide with the ship\'s laser? 

I CAN\'T prepare for every contingency using standard rules and equipment,
does this mean we have to be stagnant little Villani then and never try any-
thing new (realistic or not) because we are afraid our players might come
up with some new ideas that we hadn\'t thought of?

How much power is this paddlewheel going to produce? What kind of energy 
output is it going to have for a given size/rate of turning? Will it produce
enough
energy to break the game by making fusion obsolete/uneconomical? What is
the difference in game terms between this kind of "free" energy and that 
received by an array of super-efficient solar panels (other than the requirement
for a nearby star)? What if we state that, much like a jump engine, it can only
open the heat dump into "Dimension 32" outside of the 100-diameter limit?
Or make it take up as much space as a drive? Too costly for commercial ships,
but good for military applications when you just gotta be stealthy.

Gravity waves (in our universe) by rapid changes in the position of a
mass.  Sudden appearance/disappearance of a mass would be even more
effective.  In other words, at time t0, position X is vacuum; at time t0
plus epsilon, it\'s filled with many metric tons of dense material.  This
causes a *big* gravity wave to be generated.  Think of it as the ripples
from throwing a big rock into a pond.

I can imagine that a gravity wave can act like a sound wave when breaking the

 Most of the stats are classified, but if I remember correctly, the AIM-9
 can pull 40+ G\'s in a turn and "bends" in the middle to help its
 agility. They are *all* aspect (you no longer have to be in the rear arc
 for firing), and are very difficult to fool with most decoys.  
 
 If you have a radar track, you can slave the seeker head to that track,
 and send the missile down the beam. It will detect and lock on to the

 it is still *dumb* and can lock onto anyone. >>


I stand corrected on the AA missile.  I was refering mostly to Ground
launched and older AA missiles.  I have not been following the tech much in
the last few years. Sounds like AIM-9 are integrated and not purely IR
either, if you can slave it to a radar signal.  
 I agree with your assessment though, and most IR missiles at high TL would
be very deadly in or out of atmosphere.

I\'ve just limited it to kinetic rounds - on the basis that the laser will
do more damage as it boils off the fluids in the target. I read a

It could approach from behind the moon. Once past the moon, it could be
picked up by Norad radar, but if it is aware of that system, then it could
come in from the south polar region. Even if the radar was a threat, with tl
12+ tech, it could be easily jammed, and Norad would simply blame it on a
solar flare.

I also read this in on old JTAS for Traveller--it was in a section 
detailing Medical Rules and talked some about the nature of laser 
wounds.

One thing I really liked about TNE was their definition of a laser.

In that game, a laser could not penetrate ridgid armor--you need a 
slug thrower to do that.

Flexible armor, on the other hand, is considered as no armor vs a 
laser because it burns right through it.

The reason I like this definition is that it give a purpose for both 
lasers and slug throwers (gauss weapons) in a high tech society.

Your characters have to weigh the pros and cons.  If you think you 
are going up against enemies in vac suits or flak jackets, you use 
your laser against them.  OTOH, if your enemy has combat armor, your 
laser, with all it\'s ammo, is nothing--you need a good old guass 
rifle to punch through their armor.

I\'d like to see that line of thinking transposed to T4.

Actually, I ran through the numbers.  A star may be "very"
far away, but it is "very very" hot.  Hot enough to be brighter
than a starship moving through the solar system.

It would be interesting to do the numbers for a planet.

apply to space combat though.

The problem with having a ship cancel its own signature is that it\'s 
kind of like using your stero to cancel its own noise - it\'s just gonna 
sound funny. You need 2 disconnected sources to do this trick. You\'re
better off unplugging the thing entirely.

The best fix that I\'ve seen (which I\'ve since incorporated) is to deem
the 2D star maps to be representations of jump space -- they show how
far apart the stars are in jump terms.  Who cares about how far light
has to travel to go from one to another (well, astrophysicists, but
the 2D maps are for purposes relating to transportation, not pure 
science)?

This doesn\'t answer the question regarding whether or not it is

You\'re going to need an answer the next time the players attempt to

I don\'t think that anyone would take the position that democracy is the most efficient 
form of government, nor is it particularly natural.  Rather, it is fair and perceived as 
fair and therefore desireable by most people in the world who have some choice of what 
sort of government they have, as well as by a lot of people who don\'t have a choice.  

In fact, democracy, especially in the republican form established throughout Europe and 
the Americas, is intended to be somewhat inefficient, in order to provide enough due 
process that it will be perceived as fair and therefore legitimate.

Nazi Germany, by contrast, had a pretty efficient government -- really a 
government/business alliance.

I agree.  But the line between what you can support with science and what
requires the leap to the fantastic appears to be different for everyone.  

For example, I\'m considering a highly technological, hard SF game where the
element of "magic" (for lack of a better word) appears.  I can justify this
in scientific terms with what I believe is an appropriately small amount of
hand-waving, but even so, I imagine some SF fans would just say "ugh, that
smells like magic!" no matter how well it is justified.

But you\'re example isn\'t about playability.  I do think that in many cases
realism and playability are on opposite ends of a spectrum, where realism
is defined as corresponding to the real world in detail, and playability as
being easy to comprehend and manipulating without detracting from the fun
of the game.  If you meant _plausibility_ or internal consistency or
something like that, then I think I agree with you: it is entirely possible
to make a playable, enjoyable system that is also consistent with the real
world to some degree, and (more importantly) consistent with itself and
with our own extrapolations of how things _might_ work.

I would approve.  As a west coast person, an 8pm start time is 5 here.
Work gets a bit excited at the "Sorry, must go.  Hot IRC session..."
commetn about 4:30.  One that starts at 6 our time is possible.

Whether this is a good thing, I suppose, depends on how many people it

Well at least they didn\'t put Intel processors in it. As a matter of fact
no sattelites or space probes have intel cpus in them. The Motorola 68000
or 68HC11 or similar is the norm.

How does the holodisplays with tactile feedback work? Some kind of focussed

You need to measure a full cycle at least to determine the wavelength and
as IR is "noise" not city traffic but real white noise so your idea is
impractical at best. Another problem that makes it even more unusable is
the fact that if two lightsources of same wavelength and opposite phase
cancel each other out where does the energy go? It will be heat and there
you go again. Sound dampeners convert accoustic energy into heat, you
cannot convert heat energy into nothing unless you can break the
conservation of energy law and if you can do that anything is possible.

Well as far as I can tell armour is linear (and my trusty Rheinmetall
gunbook supports me there) but Greg has for some reason abandoned his
earlier linear armour formula.
Another note however is that Striker armour was nonlinear as they converted
it to a log value and as you know adding logs is the same as multiplying
the unlogged values. The striker tables where linear the first few steps
which made them unusable by log arithmetic and normal arithmetic as well.

I use a logscale for damage, penetration, damage absorption where x10
equals +6. This makes all numbers from fists to mesonguns manageable and
does away with hitpoints etc.

Power emitted per square area is prop to temperature in kelvins to the 4:th
power ie

p = k T^4 where k is a constant.
By increasing your radiated area you lower the temperature you\'re radiating
thus making you harder to see. Masking tech on tanks etc work by spreading
the engine exhaust heat over the hull. This works much better on earth than
in space as the background temp here is about 300 K while in space it\'s
about 3 K.

Atmosphere contains lots of water vapor that blocks IR. This is the reason
temps go down when you climb mountains as the amount of water in the air
drops faster than pressure. Some weird IR astronomers in Sweden has put IR
telescopes on high altitude baloons to get above the water vapor and thus
be able to see in IR without using sattelites.

I\'m sorry for my previous rashness and NO i don\'t think one has to be a
astronomer or whatever to enjoy Traveller, I merely stated that those are
my players which makes it extra hard for me as a ref. They generally know
MORE about each particular tech topic that come up in the game so I like to
do my homework.

Why I posted so LOUDLY was some guy made a case that technology are only
plot devices and that whenever science clashes with the story drop the
science. Any weird science is OK by me but one should not throw it in
without taking in the larger picture. If one can raise people from the dead
(canon in MT I think) then it has to have some impact on society. Will
people get mre reckless as they know they generally can be fixed up.
FF&S and the such are not what I want but rather some thought behind
scientific principles before inventing something into the game. Greg made
up some blackbody paint for spacevehicles that I think is totally idiotic.
The only thing it would do is making the ship a lot hotter and invisible to
rader that most people has agreed upon as quite unrealistic in space.

As for computer technology I think we need to do some work here in order to
make Traveller more beliavable. First I assume that Earth computer tech
today is at least TL 8. Then make some computer performance progression
like Greg has done (nipped from GURPS methinks) and start thinking about
what one does with the computers in the far future. Also how does
encryption work? In my universe there are efficient algorithms for
calculating primes a lot faster than today. This makes encrypting
interesting as one cannot safely encrypt like you can today.
Another thing to remeber when doing computer stuff: Hackers/crackers will
always use cruder stuff with cruder interfaces than Joe Public ie if
cruising the cyberspace with greenlines and chrome shapes is the norm then

I\'m sorry if I offended some sensitive egos by noting that MY players are a
bit science heavy. I did NOT and do NOT imply that scientific players are
better smarter have longer penises or whatever some people on the list
think. I merely stated that for MY gaming group I need to be more
scientifically correct as my players generally are more knowledgable than I
in certain areas. The problems with badly thought out science is not that
players will build planet killers and whatnot but that they tend to stop
believing in the traveller Universe and start playing a character oriented
wargame instead. Now that you all know my standing lets get on with the
show!

Norris was gay, though there was certainly nothing that said explicitly

enough to have children with, or that he was simply asexual.  Not that I
have a preference for any of these options, it\'s just I don\'t remember
anything _specific_ about what sort of person Morris liked to get it on
with.

  As for gay characters in RPGs in general, I think one of the real
downsides of TSR\'s desire to keep Fundamemtalists and other extremists at
bay has been a general desire on the part of the gaming business to keep
RPGs safe for the minds of a 12 year old (or what parents think is safe
for the mind of a 12 year old - I remember what my 12 year old mind was

result, gay, bi, and just plain weird folks inhabit my worlds, and since
one of the things I try and do with my Traveller future is to make it, at
least in some ways, a nicer place than today, people of non-hetero

I almost forgot another trick that would work. But it\'s only practical
for *small* ships such as fighters.

You inflate a *big* balloon. Given the surrounding vacuum, this won\'t
take much. You open a flap and scoot your fighter inside. Now you have
your fighter, with power turned down to a minimum, hiding inside
something with a surface area of a square km or more (I said *big* :-).
So the heat emissions won\'t be suspiciously above normal for a large
meteroid or small asteroid. 

It\'d be better to dock with a real asteroid and rig up a way to dump
your heat into the body of it (it has a lot more mass to absorb the
heat than the balloon does). But asteroids aren\'t always in a handy
location. 

The deflated ballon is gonna be a *large*, clumsy package. But it is a
workable idea. Even if it turns out that a fighter can\'t haul it, a
large ship can drop it off, and inflate it, and the fighter can come by
later.

Sorry, but thermodynamics says that you can\'t turn waste energy (heat)
into coherent emissions. That\'d involve reversing entropy. Therefore,
the temp of emissions is determined by watts per square meter. And it
has to follow something approaching a black body *distribution*.

To put it another way, a surface at a given temp *must* radiate a fixed
amount of energy per square meter. And the amount goes *up* as the
wavelength goes up.

Yeah, but it takes a *lot* of energy to make a "significant" shift. And
the amount required varies with the 4th power of the temp difference
you are trying to maintain. It\'s that 4th power law that kills the idea.

fols are making, I strongly suspect that they are victims of what
passes for an educational system in the US.

You see, "science" is nothing more (and nothing *less*!) than the
*only* RELIABLE means of forecasting the future that we have
discovered. 

It starts with the idea that the universe has rules. And continues with
the idea that they don\'t change. So if X causes Y today, it\'ll do so
tomorrow. If it doesn\'t then either there was a factor involved that
you didn\'t notice the first time. or there was one involved the second
time (ie you are either missing something that was there the first
time, or there was something *extra* present the second time).

This means that we *can* confidently make statements about what will be
possible in the future.

You see, contrary to what the media would have you believe, things like
relatibity did *not* through out the existing science. It just added
"qualifiers" to the rules they had discovered. Newtonian physics gives
perfectly good answers as long as you don\'t get too close to the speed
of light or too near really outrageous gravity fields.

Whenever *science* discovers "new" rules, the old rules *will* be a
"special case" of the new ones. That is, you\'ll be able to use the old
rules in the type of situations they\'d been tested and confirmed in,
just *not* in the type of situation where the new rules were
discovered. That means that the new rules "simplify" to the old rules
in most cases.

And this is why we insist that things like conservation of energy, the
laws of thermodynamics, etc *have* to apply in things like space
combat. Because we have extensive experience with speeds that high,
vacuums that low, and those sorts of temperatures. So there\'s *nothing
new* involved.

Trouble is, you have to have *matter* to radiate the heat from. So
dispersing the signature requires radiators that big. And radiators,
beside having mass (there are a few dodges to lower the mass if you
aren\'t manuevering) have the nasty habit of reflecting things like
radar and lidar. 

The most *practical* way to spread the emissions is also a current
candidate for overcoming the problems with getting enough radiator area
for some prposed future designs (something Traveller tends to overlook).

What you do is emit drops of heated liquid, project them into space and
capture them after they\'ve cooled. Having large amounts of surface area
in relation to their volume, they cool quickly.

The designs I\'ve seen tend to look like this:

                               /\\
                              /  \\
                             /|  |\\
                            / |  | \\
                           /  |  |  \\
                          /   |  |   \\
                         /    |  |    \\
                        /     |  |     \\
                       /      |  |      \\
                      ========|  |========
                              +--+

The "wings" are streams of droplets, the "=" are collection troughs.
You can have up to 3 panels without them interfering with each other.

The big disadvantage is that you need a long, thin ship to get really
large radiator areas. And the troughs have to be wide enough to not
only handle any spread from the sprayers, but also any manuevering you
do. 

You can practice some "emmission control" by having extra troughs and
sprayers, so you can use different "facings" for the panels. Cut power
down to where you only need two of them, and place them so they are
parallel to the line of sight of the enemy. So all he\'ll see is the
edge emissions from *one* of them. While it\'ll still be "hot", it\'ll be
a much smaller source.

The sort of ships these are being considered for in the real world are
such that the droplets will be white hot as they emerge, and will have
cooled to dull red or farther by the time they are collected. It makes
for a rather striking visual appearance, but lousy stealth. :-)

In theory, you could get a field like a black globe to radiate energy,
but that\'s apt to be TL17+

Anders Backman suggested PEN: As Paul noticed, we write slower than we
type. But not if we write Shorthand. Steno writing is as fast as speaking.
BTW Latin langage have few letters, The wider caracter sets langages should
write faster than they type as the keyboard become very complicated.

And for the massive data entries the virtual keyboard should be the a good
solution as Per Bernhardsson said. Maybe something like Leonard one handed
virtual "chord" pad helped by finger movement detection. 

Darryl Adams talked about a Neural interface. And I personnaliy see a eye
ball movement detector (using a laser). Neveron@aol.com suggested a lip
reading as HAL 9000 in 2001


There are many possibilities. Which one will be, I don\'t know but I think
not the keyboard/mouse. It takes too many room on a desk, You don\'t know
where to put a sheet of paper. You always have to leave the keyboard to use
the mouse (or the pen). It\'s too hard to use for beginners. I\'m on computer
for more than 14 years now. I\'m still typing with 4 fingers (I didn\'t have
a secretary course!). I type faster than I write but not much faster, just
a little faster (not more than 30% faster). For those who didn\'t noticed I
HATE KEYBOARDS!

Now, we have to think about the need of the keyboard. Several TMLers
mentionned the lecture hall. Do you need to type in a lecture hall?
Wouldn\'t you get all the books you need scanned on your portable computer
then go back home and use the data. BTW do Lecture Hall still exist in TL15
societies. Maybe the networks could bring all books on "screens" at home.
In this case you should sing to your computer as you want. 
Personnally I usually speak when I\'m typing (programming/writing). This
helps me to concentrate on my work. 

Other examples of needless keyboard : Cafe, ordering sheets, Web browsing,
data research. In two words INFORMATION READING. Most of our use of
computer is information reading. In this case you don\'t need Keyboard, you
just need a mouse or a pen, or a eyeball movement detector to start
commands (or opening menus...). You want a proof : Look at the total used
disk space on you computer. Now look at the disk space used by the
documents you\'ve wrote. If you have 1Go of used space, I\'m not sure that
you have more than 1Mo of writen text files (1Mo = 500pages pocket book).
Or you are a professionnal writer or a mad programmer.

A programmer write 100 lines a day (including design, tests and debug).
Having a very fast data entry in not necessary for programmers and
ingineers. BTW, it\'s thousand times more complicated to make a drawing with
a keyboard/mouse than with a Pen.


So _my_ opinion on computer ergonomy is
* for simple device : pen on a notepad
* for usual computer : eyeball movement detector (mouse) and Virtual one
handed chord pad or lip reader (keyboard)
Both are enhanced with vocal recognition of course. This recognition is
effective enough to distinct different people as our ears do.

And for the display I would say some kind of laser projector (holographic)
in 2D or 3D. But not this $#&@% big screen we don\'t know where to put it.

A good solution but light propagation plays a role in some adventures and
then it\'s neat to know how far apart two systems are for those
calculations. Also when scanning for gasgiants at several parsecs one need
to know the real distance between systems. All in all however its the best
handwave so far. Curiously it has never been an issue with my players.

I\'d say the most important effect of lasers is its speed of light making it
fairly easy to hit highspeed planes, missiles etc without worrying about
lead angle etc. I\'d say lasers with firecontrol would never miss a plane if
they can see it and this is the reason gravtanks where developed. They have
good armour versus lasers and hug the ground to be harder to detect. High
flying aircraft will be instantly shot down in the future. This is good as
I otherwise see no reason why gravtanks should exist (I know the real
reason is that all wargamer-referees want to play SquadLeader with
futuristic miniatures but I let that pass).

Water holds 111 kg H2 per m^3 (or thereabouts); L-hyd has a density 
of 74 kg / m^3 or thereabouts.  Conventional techniques for storing 
H2 gas in palladium metal do better than 74 kg H2 / m^3, but not that 
much better.  So this would be an order of magnitude better than 
existing technology...

More likely is that the H2 molecules adsorb onto the surface, donate 
electron density to the fibres and/or are held in interstices of the 
graphite (i.e. between layers, I suppose).  Given the extremely thin 
layers, I\'d say a lot was due to electron donation.

I suspect it\'s an inevitable consequence of the hydrogen atoms being 
drawn so close to the fibres... sooner or later, they\'ll tunnel into 
the structure and start making hydrocarbon.  In fact, I bet all this 
is done at low temperatures.

Does the original article have any references?  I\'d expect to see 
details in Phys Rev B, or J. Chem. Phys. if this were true...  
Please send details if there are any. (Who did the work, as well?)

Well the problem with fighters is that they exist in "canon" and thus has
to stay. What people are arguing is finding a plausible reason for why they
do so that players can believe in the universe. The solution to the
Battlerider problem (why people would build battleriders) got nicely solved
with the jumptime variation so this is what our work is about. We find
something weird in the Traveller universe and either get rid of it saying
it doesn\'t exist (HEPLAR in my Universe) or come up with a reason for why
they exist thus making a more consistent game world for our players to
enjoy.

Another question: What about prostitution in Traveller. The generic
startown seems full of brothels etc but do the other races also pay for
sexual services? Also do Vargr have specific periods when they are in heat
or are they like humans more or less year round fertile and willing?

Of course! But the Erwin\'s question was not what will be in 3500 years from
now (which is a stupid question indeed) but what do we have to use in our
Traveller campaign. So we ALL have to make a choice. But this choice may be
different for each of us!

I disagree. This is the mainframe view. Today, processing power (CPU) is so
cheap that every people can have one (or many). I\'ve bought a computer 8
months ago, was it the CPU or the RAM the most expensive? No it was the
screen!. And the CPU prices are high because it\'s a near monopole of Intel
(I\'ve bought a Cyrix). It could lower for the same rating.
30 years ago, the rare ressource was processing. Now it\'s information!
Today\'s networks are not built for exchange processing capacity but files
and data. Network computer are built on this concept, but they also
exchange executable codes.
So your example would be: You have a watch sized computer which is able to
access to the planetary network to get information and programms. 
BTW, if we imagine that NC (cpu+ram+io) would replace PC(cpu+ram+disk+io),
I\'m sure that the terminology "file" and "program" would disapear as they
both become "data" collected from the network.

Sure, but THIS is a user interface. As Paul D. Owensby suggested, the
voice/ears cannot be used as only computer interface. As it is cheap and
easy to build (micro and speaker), it cannot be used in all cases. It\'s
perfect for "small amount data comuters" as lifts, hotel booking machines,
TV commands. But not for data reading or scientific (starships) computers.
Human people use their ears AND there eyes to memorise data. The visual
aspects would EVER exists.

I agree with you that the vocal recognition would be the easiest (user
friendly) way to control a computer. Imagine a office with 10 people
talking to their computer. I\'m sure that their computer could handle the
sound corretly. But the people would get mad. I suggest a Lips reading
system. So you would just have to whisper. (Thanks to Neveron@aol.com for
the Lips reading system idea)

Since my I\'m doing "The Traveller Adventure" and my characters are right
now ON Pysadi, I thought I\'d comment on this.  The way it\'s set up is
that the starport is a fenced compound of Imperial territory.  The rest
of the planet is a religious hierarchy.  It\'s not that thye don\'t KNOW
about tech 12-15, it\'s that they don\'t ALLOW it.  Characters caught with
hi-tech get in serious trouble....  Which is interesting for some of my
characters with TL15 skull implant comm systems.  :)

  A few additional facts:  Skinner\'s initial research was funded by
General Mills, which had heard about Skinner\'s work through another
proposal by another researcher to guide torpedoes using dogs listening to
sound signals (this other project was apparently not funded).  The final
version of Skinner\'s system used three pigeons for redundancy.  They
pecked at a simple plastic screen at the front of the bomb, which
activated air valves that steered flaps to change direction.
Skinner blamed the cancelation of the project on a film he showed the
funding committee, where he left the top off the box with the pigeon - the
pecking made the committee laugh, and so led to to the project\'s rejection
as silly and fantastic.

until today I still had some hope of using the data there. Until today.

	Well, I changed my mind after looking at the Tech Levels of Vland Sector.
The summary says "The average tech level in the sector is 0 (ZERO) (most lie
between 0 and 0)"... what a funny typo, I thought... unfortunately, its
worse than that.

	The Vland sector is full of TL 0 (ZERO) worlds. Dozens and dozens of them.
The problem is that those worlds are not barren, and have no X starports.
Take a look, for instance, at the Answerin homeworld:

0431 Answerin    B-5848BB-0

	How can we have a world with 500 million inhabitants and a B starport, at
TL 0? According to the CT/MT/T4 rules, that B starport gives a DM of +4 for
rooling TL, that should be 1D+4, i.e. some number between 5 and 10.
Certainly, not zero. some more examples:

0232 Shimshirar  E9C7755-0  Fl
0637 Bood          A240100-0   Po De Lo
0740 Kirov           B683644-0   Ni Ri

1313  Aadas        C778666-0   Ag Ni
1437  Igikuuni       B797755-0   Ag

	I could go on with dozens of examples like this... Igikuuni should have a
DM of +6, implying a TL between 7 and 12.

	The problem seems to be specific of Vland sector. In Massilia sector, there
is not even a single one TL 0 world (in fact, there is the opposite problem:
how comes dozens of Barren worlds have high TLs?) In other sectors, there
are a few TL 0 worlds that should be a bit more advanced, like Arkauummesh
(Antares 1132, E-694555-0 Ag Ni). There are at least 4 cases in Antares and
two in Gushemege. But in Vland, there around 60 (SIXTY) non-barren, non
LowPop, TL 0 worlds.

	In case the data gets fixed, I hope that everything gets checked, not only
the Law=Gob mistake.

before I had the chance of presenting them here ;-), but, at last, here it
is, the 4th installment of the History of the Geonee, featuring the Long
Night, the birth of ADRAT, and the first contact with the Syleans...

================================================================================
The Long Night

	The year -1,776 is usually taken as the starting point of the economic
collapse of the Rule of Man and the Long Night. The Solomani were not able
to maintain an empire of more than 10,000 worlds, and the economic recession
destroyed what they had conquered.
	The Geonee Autonomous Region managed to maintain interstellar trade for
some centuries, but its volume diminished steadily until the worlds were all
but isolated. The Region had been too much integrated into the Second
Imperium to be able to construct a viable interstellar economy alone.
	Only three of the eight original worlds survived the Long Night: Shiwonee
(1430), Hiponee (1027), and Lagna (1025). These three worlds fell all the
way from TL 12 to TL 5, although Lagna retained some more advanced,
specialized knowledge in environmental control and food processing which
allowed its population to maintain pressure-dome cities and to survive in
the vacuum atmosphere of the world.
	But, once the three worlds were at a locally sustainable tech level,
progress started again. The Geonee felt they had lost the stars again, but
it was not the first time after all.
	Around year -400, Shiwonee was at TL 9, with a high population. The Meeralo
Council, once again coordinating planetary affairs, started two different
programs to relieve population pressures. The first was centered on orbital
settlements: the first orbital city was constructed -410, and many more
followed.
	The second was more ambitious, and involved the use of weather control to
make extensive regions of Shiwonee inhabitable regardless of the particular
moment of the climatic cycle. This program started in -320.
	Both programs were so successful that all population control measures were
abandoned. The population growth was exponential, and Shiwonee promptly
exceeded the 10,000 millions figure.
	In -250, the three surviving Geonee worlds were able to launch space
expeditions once again. Re-contact occurred soon. Shiwonee even established
a small base in Prindee (1330). The Long Night was gone.

The Second Confederation

	In -190, representatives of Hiponee, Lagna, and the different nations of
Shiwonee, met at Prindee and declared the Second Confederation. Its declared
goal was "to claim the stars again".
	The Confederation was born as an agreement between the different dominant
classes of the three worlds: the high-ranking bureaucrats of Hiponee, the
industrial supporters of the dictatorship of Lagna, and the members of the
Meeralo Council and different national leaders of Shiwonee. So, it was
natural that in the early stages, all these classes agreed to recognize each
other in equal terms and establish a "nobility" system. The Confederation
issued noble titles to the most powerful families of the member worlds, and
it is precisely this nobility who has ruled the Confederation until
nowadays, through their legislative body, known as the Assembly. All noble
families held a seat in the Assembly, and the more powerful held several.
The Meeralo Council was granted 18 seats in the Assembly, one per member, in
recognition of its key role in the Geonee history.
	In -180, the Confederation started a program to "claim back" all the former
Geonee worlds. The empty worlds in the Stenardee cluster were surveyed, and
small colonies were built.
	In these worlds, the remnants of the former inhabitants were found,
including relic technology from the Rule of Man. Moreover, when star travel
became frequent, whole starships were found in some asteroid belts.

ADRAT

	In year -175, the Confederation sponsored an association whose goals were
to coordinate technical research and the retrieval of relic technology. This
organization was called ADRAT: Association for the Development and Retrieval
of Advanced Technology. This organization was also charged with the
management of all technical schools in the Geonee worlds. Moreover, as soon
as the Geonee scouts recontacted new worlds in Massilia, ADRAT bases
including technical schools were established.
	ADRAT soon assumed the coordination of exploration and trade outside the
boundaries of the Confederation. Its bases consisted, in addition to the
technical schools, of both scout and merchant facilities. But the retrieval
aspect was never forgotten, and its scope soon exceeded the Rule of Man
relics. In Shem (1535), ADRAT constructed a base whose only goal was the
study an Ancient Site. Shortly after that, the Confederation put all Ancient
sites in its worlds under the direct authority of ADRAT.

Contact: Syleans

	In year -150, advanced scouts from the Sylean Federation meet the Geonee.
The Syleans were too far away for trade between the two interstellar states
to be profitable, but cultural and technical exchange was fruitful.
	Sylea had retained a small Geonee population through the Long Night, and
the initial stages of contact were smoothed by this fact. In year -95, a
Geonee Embassy and ADRAT office at Sylea, and a Sylean Consulate at
Shiwonee, were established.
	For the following decades, the Geonee Confederation was an almost
obligatory stop for the long-range Sylean scouts and traders. In fact, some
Sylean Megacorporations signed specific accordments with ADRAT regarding
trade in the coreward subsectors of Massilia.

================================================================================
The Expansionist Temptation

	Around year -100, Shiwonee, then at TL 11, had a very high population, in
excess of 30,000 millions (two thirds of which lived either in orbital
cities or in regions with TL 12 weather control). The other two founders of
the confederation were far from those figures: Lagna (fully at TL 12) had
only around 100 million, and the Hiponee population hardly exceeded two
millions. But the power structures did not reflect this sharp contrast. The
composition of the Assembly did not give even simple majority to the
Shiwonee representatives.
	The Second Confederation was initially focused on technical advancement,
exploration, and trade. But part of the noble families, notoriously those
vinculated to the Lagna dictatorship, were more inclined to transform the
Confederation into an interstellar empire. After year -100, those noble
families gained influence, and the Confederation politics changed accordingly.
	In year -85, the Confederation assumed as a goal to bring under its rule
all the former territory of the Geonee Autonomous Region. This included with
Kiimda (1328), Diuuk (1428) and Llyrn (0931).
	Llyrn, home of a minor alien race, had a high population at the moment and
was not convinced to join the Confederation. Nevertheless, there was a long
tradition of friendly relations with the Geonee, and the Llyrnians slowly
became a Client State. In -81, a Confederation Embassy was established at
Llyrn, and, in year -73, a detailed commercial treaty was signed.
	Meanwhile, Kiimda had a low population of colonists and Diuuk was home only
to a few hundreds of thousands of inhabitants. Both planets were militarily
occupied in -78.
	In -62, Zuuni (1133) was starting to become a commercial rival to the
Confederation. After a hot, secret debate, the Lagna dictator, Count
Ger-Ganaal, imposed his views and the Geonee navy was dispatched to raid the
world. Some noble families from Hiponee, lead by Marquis Riweega, where so
outraged that their representatives to the Confederation left their seats.
	In -48, the conquered colony of Kiimda was given a specific role. Its
starport was upgraded, and many civilian TL 12 shipyards from Lagna and
Shiwonee were moved there. Nevertheless, the military shipyards were instead
concentrated at Rigaal (0928). 
	On the external side, diplomatic efforts were made to bring Geonee worlds
or communities outside the Confederation closer to its interests. The ADRAT
bases in Forquee (1719) and Parahee (2934) were complemented with full
Confederation Embassies.
	In Forquee, the population was of three origins: Vilani, Solomani, and
Geonee. A Solomani-managed bureaucracy had managed to counterbalance the
Vilani efficiency and the Geonee technical capability throughout the Long
Night. The world turbulent past was all but forgotten, and there was no
belligerence between the three different races. In fact, a significant part
of the population had already mixed origins. The Confederation attempts were
well-received, but the world was not a Geonee one.
	In Parahee, the traditional door to Delphi sector, the situation was
different: a number of nations had managed to survive through the Long
Night, including a traditional Geonee society and a pure-Vilani corporation.
The Confederation ambassador supported an armed escalation of the Geonee
against the Vilani, and a limited war erupted, only to end after a few years
with no decisive victory for either side.

The Hiponee Civil War

	Meanwhile, some noble families of Hiponee, close to Count Ger-Ganaal, had
been transforming the bureaucratic government of their world into an
oligarchic, more oppressive system. In year -45, Marquis Riweega opposed the
designation of a cousin of Count Ger-Ganaal as new Economy Minister for
Hiponee. When his followers started a peaceful demonstration in Hiponee\'s
capital, the police violently repressed them. Marquis Riweega ordered their
personal guard to shoot back at the police. In a few weeks, the incident
evolved into a full-fledged civil war.
	In the course of the year, the vast majority of the population of Hiponee
sided with Marquis Riweega. The world\'s government called the Confederation
for help, and Count Ger-Ganaal sent in large contingents of troops from
Lagna, along with some non-Geonee mercenaries. The civilians resisted and
organized themselves. Count Ger-Ganaal asked the Confederation to authorize
the Navy to make orbital bombardments of the rebel cities, but the
representatives of the Meeralo Council invoked a clause of the Confederation
proclamation that forbade any armed action of the Confederation Navy against
a member world.
	The war lasted for three years, and ended with the capture and public
execution of Marquis Riweega. The world population had been decimated and
its cities were totally ruined. The Meeralo Council proposed a civil
reconstruction program, but Count Ger-Ganaal had the loyalty of the winning
military forces and refused the plan. After a long debate, he forced a
drastic set of measures to avoid any possibility of a new rebellion.
	The garden world of Hiponee was declared "reserved" to the nobility and
divided into private states. The surviving population, which numbered less
than one million, was forced to migrate to the unpleasant neighboring world
of Dreva (1028). The planet industries were moved to Kiimda (1328), a jump-3
from Hiponee.

Sylean involvement

	Count Ger-Ganaal continued to influence the politics of the Confederation.
In year -38, a new military campaign ended with the conquest of the
low-population water world of Shirarermi (1630), and of the rich world of
Niikishi (1629), with a population of almost two millions.
	Kiimda continued to fulfill its role as the industrial backyard of the
Confederation: in -37, several heavy pollutant industries from Shiwonee
where moved there.
	Meanwhile, the Sylean presence in the Massilia sector had been steadily
growing. Some long-term analysts (among them the economic advisor for Grand
Duke Felix Zhunastu) had decided that, given the wide presence of Geonee
bases (mainly from ADRAT) in the Massilia sector, if the Confederation
continued to be an expansionist power, it could eventually grow into an
interstellar, sector-wide empire which would become a serious threat for the
Sylean interests. This potential threat was even more serious given the fact
that the Confederation was on the cutting edge of technology: Shiwonee was a
TL 12 world, and Lagna was even more advanced in some fields.
	Although the Sylean Federation denied all possible involvement, it seems
proved that, in year -34, either some Sylean megacorporation, either the
Sylean Federation itself, helped economically the rebel underworld at Diuuk
(1428). The rebellion was successful, in part thanks to the fact that most
of the Geonee troops were stranded in Niikishi.
	The independence of Diuuk came as a hard strike against Count Ger-Ganaal
imperial dream. He lost most of his support at the Assembly and the
Confederation ordered the end of the occupation of Niikishi and Shirarermi.
Huge contingents of troops were transferred to Kiimda in order to protect
the industrial facilities against any possible external attack.
	When the Sylean involvement was discovered, the Sylean Consul was expelled
from Shiwonee, and several Sylean merchants were imprisoned. A Sylean
Consulate was immediately opened at Diuuk, and an official protest was
issued to the Confederation
	One year after the Diuuk Rebellion, Count Ger-Ganaal died in an unexplained
accident when his personal starship took off Shiwonee\'s orbital starport.
His son Ar-Ganaal inherited the title but lacked the personal charisma and
wide support of his father. The Confederation abandoned the imperial dream.
	After three years of negotiations and diplomatic maneuvers, formal
relations were re-established with the Sylean Federation. In year -30, a
Free Trade Accordment was signed, and a full Sylean Embassy was set up at
Shiwonee.

The Third Imperium

	In year 0, Grand Duke Cleon Zhunastu of Sylea transformed the Sylean
Federation into the Third Imperium. Vland and the Vilani core worlds joined
almost immediately.
	The Sylean Ambassador, Baron Mazun von Traianus, formally asked the Geonee
Confederation to join the Third Imperium, but the Assembly refused. Some
radical voices claimed that the Geonee worlds would never again be under the
same rule that Vland.
	The situation was made worse when, in year 3, Diuuk announced its will to
join the Third Imperium, despite the fact that there were almost no imperial
worlds in the whole Massilia sector. Ambassador Traianus guaranteed that no
Sylean commercial facilities were going to be moved to Diuuk from the Geonee
Confederation.
	Since then, the Geonee Confederation has had peaceful (but not always
friendly) relations with the Third Imperium. Although commercial conflicts
have been common, and even some minor military skirmishes have occurred,
today it seems that the Third Imperium is willing to respect the
Confederation\'s independence, and the Confederation has no interest in
becoming a military or political power outside its current boundaries.
	Many worlds with ADRAT bases are now members of the Imperium, and thus
ADRAT is becoming more and more involved with imperial politics. In fact,
the recent establishment of Imperial Scout Deep Bases at Shem (1535) and
Parahee (2934) has counted with the collaboration of ADRAT.
	Geonee traders travel through both imperial and non-imperial space, and, as
the Imperium is opening new markets each year, they benefit from it as much
as any imperial citizen.
	Moreover, one should not forget the significant numbers of Geonee that are
already imperial citizens, none of which has forgotten his origins, and that
are helping to bridge the gap between the Imperium and the Confederation.
	Some Imperial megacorporations have shown a definite interest into the
Confederation technology, some of whose achievements are well above the
Imperium average. Shiwonee is a TL 12 world, but the heavy industries
located at Kiimda have already reached TL 13. Thanks to ADRAT, Lagna has
reached an impressive TL 14 in the last years (space transportation not
included), although its economy is not capable of mass-producing items for
exportation.

energy.  I also quite like the idea that Traveller starships aren\'t 
so trivial to detect.  I\'d like to stick as close to canon as I can.

I don\'t want to join the heat war (like a flame war but milder?) but 
here\'s one example of the sort of thing that might be invented, using 
exisiting ideas.

OK, here\'s the (so-called) logic:

i) Thruster plates are a device which use gravitational forces to 
power a ship.

ii) Thruster plates emit high-energy photons (and other gunk by way 
of particles?) in operation.

iii) Hence there exists a (fairly) canonical link between gravity and
EM radiation, as well as the general ability to apply energy to 
gravity which is implied by contragrav.

iv) Fusion powerplants use gravitic confinement (the explanation for 
why Earth took so long to get it to work; kept mucking around with EM 
fields instead).  This is MT canon, for sure, tho\' it probably breaks 
T4 since grav focussing for lasers is TL13 there.

This is where one speculates:

v) There exists a gravitic cooling effect which bleeds waste heat 
into fairly small, incoherent gravity "noise", which can of course be 
detected by densitometers.  It works for all EM radiation, of course,
and is probably best for "harder" radiation given the very energetic 
photons associated with the thruster plates.  Effect: waste energy is 
sufficient to keep the ship at ambient temp. (call it 300K).

vi) Not all the ship needs to be at 300K; the fuel tanks (which will 
be on the outside) can or should be kept cooler.  In effect, the 300K 
core of the ship (small surface) radiates via fuel tanks (larger 
surface area) which will help keep the surface temperature down a bit 
- -- while the tanks are full, anyway.

vii) Dark surfaces will help the ship cool more evenly and more 
quickly -- thus reducing the temperature at which the ship is in 
equilibrium with 3K space a bit (not much).

Even given all this, ships will be thermally bright, just a bit less 
so.  Hardly matters anyway if they\'re using HEPlaR -- the secondary 
emissions from the plasma will be very visible.

What other implications has gravitic cooling?  Can you use it as 
shields to defend against lasers?  Well, not easily -- the gravity 
stresses required to attenuate a coherent beam would rip apart any 
device which generated them, or any structure carrying it.  Maybe the 
black globe is a related product, tho\'.  It might be a good way to 
protect ships from harmful solar radiation, though.

I knew there had to be a good explanation for all those contra-grav 
plates on ship hulls 8-).

Nick

P.S. What the high detectability of ships leads to is a situation 
where detection range >> combat range.  (I have some doubts about the 
effectiveness of lasers and particle weapons at the very long ranges 
given in T4, anyway.)  This is similar to the age of fighting sail,
where one could see ships from the masthead long before they were in
cannon range.

Great, if all I want is a transcription.  I\'ll even admit than intelligent
enough software might be able to pull out relevant bits of the speech
later, making detailed summary note-taking irrelevant.

But what if I\'m a professional listening to a lecture on, say, new
technology, ways of doings things, new theories, what have you, the sort
of thing likely to spark lots of independent ideas in my own head?  Unless
we\'re postulating telephathic computers, it\'s _not_ going to pick up on
those, and I will darn well want to strike while the iron is hot and get
those ideas down in some sort of permanent form for later review.  I don\'t
want to have to say them, lest I distract others (or allow them to steal
my concepts!), and, again, I don\'t want to use my own respiratory tract
lest I interfere with my own listening.  So how do I note down my
inspirations?

Basically, our ideal computer technology has to handle a multitude of
teaching, note-taking, and learning styles.  I\'m not denying that any of
it sounds great, just that it needs more flexibility.

Yet about the ONLY shuttle subsystem that the committee

software.

"Surely, You\'re Joking, Mr. Feynmann" or maybe the sequel "What do YOU

Thanks for the kind words...and I was trying to show that honest, \'real\'
role-players could be hurt by hand-waved physics, not *just* munchkins.
Any plot hole a real role-player can wander into all unawares, a dedicated
munchkin can find and exploit intentionally. :)

My experience is that handwaved physics and technology *do* break
scenarios more often, and more seriously, than simple player creativity
within \'canon\' background.  Larry Niven created an indestructible
spacecraft hull for his story "Neutron Star", in the Known Space universe.
He later wrote that he cursed the day he did that, as *every single KS
story* after that had to answer the question "How come an indestructible
hull won\'t solve this problem?"  The same thing happens in RPGs.  The more
items of tech and physics you drop into your scenarios, the harder you
have to work to make future scenarios not "crackable" using these
technologies.  Another example from SF is Star Trek\'s transporter.  It was
handwaved into existence in order to avoid the necessity of time-consuming
"shuttle down to planet" sequences in every episode.  And look how many
credence-straining handwaves the writers have had to engage in, for 30
years, to explain why the imperiled crew members on Planet Foobar couldn\'t
be beamed to safety.

In short:  Handwaved physics and tech constrains your scenarios, and
litters the dramatic landscape with consistency landmines. :)

With groups I\'ve played with, "kill \'em all and let\'s leave this
godforsaken rockball" is *always* a possible course of action.  I\'d have
seen this possibility and made it somehow unuseable -- or perhaps not, and
let the players live with all those murders on their consciences.  But it
*was* predictable as a potential course of action a priori.

"Stagnant little Vilani" -- I *like* that! :)  And no, that\'s not what I\'m
saying at all.  I\'m merely suggesting that GMs be cautious about ad lib
physics and tech, never using them without thinking through the
consequences for the rest of the background, and being aware that they\'ll
never ever think of *everything* a priori.

Sound masking works pretty well, actually.  My girlfriend has a pair of
noise cancelling headphones that cuts the high frequencies quite decently.

Your suggestion would work fine, save that one word - sense.

You have to sense the exact wave being transmitted.  Knowing that it is
radiating at 200K is not enough - you also need to know exactly _what_ it
is radiating.  The temperature will tell you roughly what you can expect,
but to mask it, you need the exact opposite.

Once you have sent it, you need to invert the signal and send it out.
Doing so would be non trivial, but possible, save for one problem.  The
time it takes to flip the wave and generate it means that your signal will
be late.  It will not mask the source.  With sound, we can use a light
speed signal to tell the inverter and speaker what to say.

If you posit some kind of short distance FTL transmission, then it could
work, but imagine what a clever player could do with that.  My bet is that
you would be better off with that than an energy sump or black box, but I
am open to discussion.

My personal favorite is something that is a fragile heat barrier.  It can
handle small heating quite well, but degrades at anything over the
temperature of a candle flame; like a high tech oven mitt.  This is why it
is not good for reflec, and you still have to cool the ship down to perhaps
100K for it to do a decent enough job, but it is good for dramatic effect.

It dramatically increases the load on a ship\'s coolers, and it cannot last
for long.  It does, however, mean that you can limit radiation to the
radiator fins and heat sumps of your vessels for some time.  For a big.
powerful ship, a pretty short time, and for a small ship with minimal
heating, a fairly long one.  Still not a cloak.

>This, in theory, is how EMM would work in Milenu 0. This also may be the

FWIW, I have masking being done by careful attention to which direction a
ship can be detected from, careful radiator placement, and reduced
emissions.  I also assume that a black globe is just plain magic.  It has
some obvious problems, and if the technology was understood well enough,
you could probably do all sorts of things, but all black globes (in my
world) are imperfect copies of 200Kyr old ones.

I\'m pretty sure that they\'d come up to 300 K fast enough to make this
not all that useful -- but damn it, that\'s such a great image I say we
ignore thermodynamics and go with it! :)

Very nice work!  I agree, Cleon I needs an appropriately impressive state
vessel, and the Brittania makes a good model.  I\'m not sure about pressing
random crewmembers into steward duty, however...one would imagine that
serving royalty and honored guests of like rank would be *very* touchy
business, and that a misplaced salad fork might lead to ruined diplomatic
relations and perhaps open warfare.  I\'m not sure I want the assistant

Of course, and that\'s just what I\'d do...though not as well as you, sounds
like.  And as a one-off solution, it would work fine.  The problem is, if
you do this sort of thing too often, the players *will* start to see the
pattern that whenever they try something clever with game-universe physics
and technology, it blows up in their faces, or doesn\'t work for
far-fetched reasons.  And that *pattern* detracts from belief in the game
universe.

Of course -- but if you litter your universe with *too* many ad-hoc
additions and handwaved pieces of background, you\'ll soon find you have
*no* (or damn little) control of where your scenarios go -- unless you
resort to de facto banning of all routes other than those you\'ve prepared.

Mine too, and those are the ones I like to remember.  Some of my most
embarrassingly horrible failures have come out of ad lib, too, though.
Every scenario without exception will involve *some* ad lib, of course;
I\'d just prefer to keep the overall dramatic arc somewhere close to a
route I\'ve done *some* thinking about, most of the time.

Excellent ideas.  Also, for the ever-useful hand computer I would suggest
electrodes which pick up nerve signals and muscle contractions and
translate them into various commands.  The user of such a system would
need some training, but perhaps no more than learning to type. 

One of my gripes with cyberpunk is how unlikely some of it is.  While
hackers and spies might well get implanted neural jacks, Jane or John
clerk will not.  Someone will be designing interfaces for average folks,
and by 5700 AD I\'d expect them to be pretty damn sophisticated (if for no
other reason than that humans will have been using computers for many
centuries, not 40-some years). 

Anyway, contact electrodes won\'t tire out your hands an can be done very
subtlely (great for high powered Vilani megacorp meetings, especially if
combined with a bone-conduction speaker for output).  For even more
versatility, maybe the computer could add in a choker or headband which
picked up the nerve signals associated with certain types of thought (and
possibly throat vibrations form subvocalization to with the choker).  Here
we have input at virtually the speed of (mildly trained) thought with no
neural jacks or other surgery.  The display can be on the users wrist, the
pickup on head or throat, and the CPU on wrist, or belt, all connected by
either IR wireless interfaces or the body electric field stuff they are
working on at MIT. 

In addition to using this for hand computers, the headband or choker alone
could also be standard equipment for daily life (well decorated and
stylish for the rich) which would automatically interface with most common
devices. Think advanced. 

My only question is whether there is a similarly nifty way to do visual
output? Audio output can be handled through a medium-sized earring with a
bone conduction speaker (on the back of the earring where it touches the
head. But I can see any) way to do visual output w/o screens or
holofields. 

As a final idea, how about personal secretaries much like the AI credit
card sized computer (named Velma?) in the dreadful show "Time Tracks". 
Turn the full AI into merely a well designed expect system and you could
have another nifty device for Traveller. 

Other comments or ideas?

Might there be gravitic "currents" in places where space is not flat --
that is, in-system?  The closer you get to a large gravitational mass, the
faster/broader/more turbulent these currents.  This could mean that
thrusters that depend on gravity might work better in some places than
others, or in some directions than others.  This could set you up for
age-of-sail-like maneuvering, where you try to get the "gravity gauge" on
your opponent.  Just a thought.

What about when the computer goes down in the starport?  What about 
High Tech maintenance?  What about the infrastructure required for 
such a facility?

Do they send off planet when they need something?  And, looking at 
the map (and the surrounding TLs), when what they need arrives, does 
it come straight from Aramis?

That seems a long way from Pysadi.  But maybe the Pysadi starport is 
a large enough facility to be self contained--which is certainly 
possible.  It\'s just hard for me to buy given the remote location of 
Pysadi, its TL, and its low number of exports (the Pysadians worship 
Mother Pysadi.  I doubt they they export any amounts of minerals or 
ores.)

I\'m not disagreeing with you here--just exploring options.

On the Pysadi that my characters are on, the starport is a mish-mash 
of technology.

I picture it like someone in the US visiting a third world country.  
Religion is strong.  There\'s people carrying goods to market in carts 
pulled by oxyen.  Telephones are primitive.

But since the planet has a tainted atmosphere, technology for sealing 
buildings and air recirculation is much more advanced than the 
average TL 4 planet.

Building materials are also advanced, given the TL, and whereas many 
TL 4 homes might not even have air conditioning on other worlds, all 
Pysadian structures are well built, sealed buildings with electronic 
air reprocessing units attached to them.


This twisting of TLs can also be seen in the starport.

The starport uses chalk boards, a PA, and index cards to keep track 
of cargoes, yet they have integrated the technology to provide power, 
L-Hyd fuel, and the other minimums that a Class C starport must 
provide.

You might post a hand written sign with a staple to a cork board 
soliciting freight business for your next destination, but a 
technician examing your jump drive for the cause of that warning 
light you spotted last trip is using a wheeled, self contained high 
tech diagnotic system for the job.

When I think about life on Pysadi, I usually assume that everything 
is in line with a TL 4 culture, but some things cannot be at TL 4, 
like I have suggested above.  These higher tech items have been 
imported at some point, and a minimum infrastructure has been set up 
to support them.

My characters are on a TL 4 world--it should be different from 
visiting a Class C starport on a TL A world.

And this is the type of thinking that I would like to see in that 
book.

    'body' => 'Nick Munn just e-mailed me in private with an idea for KBv2.0 that I 
think is just brilliant.

As many of you know, I\'ve stated that the T4 xp system is broken, and 
that\'s the direction of my next project.

Nick\'s idea is probably half the answer of that problem.  

We\'re still going to have to come up with a good game 
mechanic for allowing character\'s to increase in skill level.  Nick\'s 
idea is the results part--after you\'ve determined that a character 
has gone up, Nick has brilliantly laid out what benefit to a 
character this has.

I\'ve got to say that seeing ideas like Nick\'s is one of the reasons I 
post KBv2.0 to the list--I certainly haven\'t been thinking in this 
direction.



What\'s this great idea, anyway?

After it has been determined that a character goes up in skill level 
(method for this to be determined), Nick has devised a simple method 
to increase the experience score.

Remember, the experience score in KBv2.0 is:

                    Experience Score = Skill Level x 3

And target numbers are calculated by:

                    Target Number = Attribute + Experience Score



Nick\'s idea is simple, but it can get confusing stating it.  So, in 
order to be as plain as possible, follow me through an example.



You\'ve got a character named Bridje:
                   Bridje   Int 7     Mechanics-1

Under KBv2.0, Bridje\'s target number for a mechanics roll would be:
                    (1 x 3) + 7 = 10
                    TN = 10

Bridje\'s experience score for his mechanics skill is 3 (1 x 3).  
Under Nick\'s idea, when Bridje gets a mechanics skill increase 
(system for this to be determined), his experience score will be:

                        Experience Score = (1 x 3) + 1

Basically, we add 1 to the experience score.  The new target number 
will be:
                      (1 x 3) + 1 + 7 = 11
                      TN = 11

If Bridje gets another increase for his mechanics skill, his 
experience score is raised again by 1 point:

                          Experience Score = (1 x 3) + 2

And, figuring his new target number:
                        (1 x 3) + 2 + 7 = 12
                        TN = 12


How the actual skill level is increased:

On Bridje\'s third increase, his mechanics skill level is increased by 
1.  Because:

                        (1 x 3) + 3 + 7 = 13
                        TN = 13

is the same as:

                        (2 x 3) + 7 = 13
                        TN = 13



Why I like this:

I like Nick\'s idea for several reasons.  The biggest is that it fills 
in the gaps that the experience score has.

At skill level 1, your experience score is 3.  At skill level 2, your 
experience score is 6.  At skill level 3, your experience score is 9, 
etc.

Nick\'s idea, in a simple game mechanic, raises the KBv2.0 experience 
score by one point each increase instead of 3.  

It\'s a smoother, cleaner system, and, using Nick\'s idea, it is easy 
to compare the skill of two characters--even if they have the same 
skill level.

Do all Pilot-3\'s the same level of skill in piloting?

As a general group, I\'d say yes.  But when comparing individuals, I\'d 
say you might find one Pilot-3 that is a tiny bit better than another 
character also rated at Pilot-3.

Nick\'s idea distinguishes this through the use of the experience 
score.

Given this system, we now have three phases of skill expertise to a 
skill level.  Look at this chart:

Skill Phase                                   Exp. Score
- ----
Brand new Level x.                    3 x Skill Level
Experienced Level x.                  (3 x Skill Level) + 1
Expert Level x.                            (3 x Skill Level) + 2



This is a simple idea (and game mechanic) that is hard to express.  
If I\'ve done a poor job of explaining it, please e-mail me.  I\'ll try 
to be clearer and answer any questions you might have.

Good job Nick!

Kenneth.

had enough (as I have, for the most part):

Darryl, I have to agree with you here: I like small fightercraft in
Traveller, they have indeed been there since Classic Traveller times
(though I\'m not against changing canon to fit better with "reality" as we
understand it), and I find uses for them in my campaign, where they
succeed not as major fleet elements, but as sensor and customs pickets,
probing scout craft, and ground-troop or orbital attack support.  Like in
B5, I guess, they\'ll never win the day, but they\'re great for harassment
and sowing confusion.  The recent thread on fighters was interesting, if
long-winded -- I deleted much of it.  Like many arguments on TML, it seems
to be a disagreement more on degree than on principle: how common are
fighters, and what are their duties?  NOTE, however, and this is
particularly important in light of discussion later in the post, that I
provide a limited, but logical rationale for their existence, rather than
just _carte_blanche_ declaring "fighters exist!" without more description,
moderation, or limitation.

End fighter discussion.  Back to the fray!

Here you restate the position that I think is causing all the dissension.
I would quote your letter directly and in the original, but your English
orthography is so execrable that I\'ll give you a free editing job:

> Traveller technology is based on items that don\'t exist, can\'t exist, or
> shouldn\'t exist....  The reason they are there: because they would be
> fun to have.

But this is wrong.  Traveller technology may not exist (now or ever), or 
be able to exist according to our current scientific knowledge: but, for
the players in the game, IT HAS TO FEEL LIKE IT CAN EXIST!  Gratuitous
handwaving all too easily destroys that suspension of disbelief.  If you
can\'t see that, you\'ve been watching too many Saturday morning cartoons.
Sure, you might enjoy it, it might be just what you and your players are
looking for... but, to many of us, it disrupts, if I can wax poetic for a
line or two, the poetry of the experience, the joy of trying to exist
logically in someone else\'s mind, body, and universe.

It is not enough for us to want something to be there.  To wish it into
being without supporting and justifying it is lazy, selfish, and unkind, 
both to you and to your players.  To wit:

First, my biology knowledge, even just from long-ago high school, balks at
the idea of a dried sap that is superior to metal.  (What universe is
Australia in, that its inhabitants both speak such wildly different
English and also have such fantastic plants?)  Is the presence of such
miraculous yet simple stuff the reason for battle-dress: so that Imperial
marines can take on the hordes of otherwise-impervious sap-covered TL0
natives?  If sap can replace metal, why doesn\'t everyone use it, since you
can grow the stuff instead of having to mine and refine it?  Observe that
by lazily providing one throw-away detail, you\'ve changed the Traveller
universe.  Having your own universe is fine, of course -- many on the TML
have their own ways of doing things.  But you don\'t seem to put the
thought in to consider even the simplest effects of super-sap on the
"canonical" universe. 

As for the idiocy of decrying all this gearhead-vs.-mushhead disagreement
as simply due to "Western consumer technological patterns" -- the laws of
phsyics are not passed by legislatures or bought by consumers.  They exist
regardless of what you and I think, want, or hope.  They determine what is
possible: your culture or economy merely determine what is desirable.  And
a triumph of culture over universe, of hero over fact, is probably one of
the simplest possible descriptions of escapist high fantasy.  Which is
fine, but it isn\'t Traveller, nor, to my lights, _science_ fiction.  You
can play what you want to play, as you like it: just don\'t insist that the
system rules and publications, which by Marc Miller\'s own statements
(read the T4 introduction) emphasize complexity within versimilitude and
the premise that "economics is everything," prostitute themselves to your
own prejudices.

They get 1000 kg in 13.5 or 14 m^3 (depending on which version of the
rules you use). So instead of 1 ton per dTon, you\'d get 23.166 ton/dTon
or 24.024 ton/dTon.

Some tactical feedback would simply imitate whether an object was rough
or smooth, perhaps using some sort of focused magnetic field. This same
magnetic field could give the feel of resistance to simulate button
pushing. How this would translate to a tactical readout could be limited
only by imagination.

Nice try, but no cigar. If it *was* "pushing" on the star, then the
enery required to increase your velocity would increase as your
velocity increased. That is, if it took X to get to 1 km/s, it\'d take
*4X* to get to 2 km/s, and 9X to get to 3 km/s.

That\'s a *massively* losing proposition.

Thanks for the information. With that in mind, how effective would the

Try and find a copy of the old "Rockets, Missiles, and Spacecraft"
book. I forget whether it was by von Braun or by Willy Ley or both.
Anyway, there\'s a discussion of it there. 

It was a design they came up with near the end of WWII. It was
sub-orbital, but would get high enough to "skip" off the upper
atmosphere 5 or 6 times. That\'d have it re-entering on the *opposite*
side of the globe. And it could drop bombs during any skip.

The trouble was, the payload was only about a ton (in addition to the
pilot). And while the "skip" zones did include some useful target
areas, the landing zone didn\'t include anything thaty the germans *or*
Japanese had control over.

If the German atomic program hadn\'t made an error that resulted in
their thinking nuclear weapons were impossible, it might have gotten
built because they\'d hope to be able to cram one in and drop it on
Washington or Moscow.

And here is where the difference between the camps comes in. Your
"reason" has to explain why not only why/how that bit of technology can
break that law of physics, but why *nothing else can*. And in addition,
it has to explain why breaking that law doesn\'t have <fill in "obvious

Those two requirements are *very* difficult to fill. We lucked out on
Jump drive, as my researches show that it is sufficiently hard to get
time travel using J-drive plus other Imperial tech that they aren\'t
likely to have tried very hard.

But thruster plates (to name just one item) are a quite different
story. <sigh>

Why *can\'t* they slow down as fast? The g-rating measures how fast you
can change speed. So if two ships have the *same* g-rating, then the
only possible difference in how fast they can slow down is how long it
takes to flip the ship end for end so you can use the main drive to
decelerate. And even on *huge* ships, that\'s a very *minor* amount of
time (for a ship a km long, I think it takes all of a few minutes to
flip if you want to keep the centripetal accel under a g)

They can do it as well as anything else with the same g-rating.

It means that the universe isn\'t a closed system anymore. And the
machine may not be "perpetual", but it might as well be, depending on
how long it takes for the effective temperature of the other universe
to rise. 

Given the huge number of galaxies in *this* universe, the odds are
pretty good that *somebody* has been making widespread use of this for
millenia. So if they can still dump energy in at a rate that lets a
ship get its hull down to 3K, it\'s gonna take trillions of years to
make a difference. So that\'s *effectively* perpetual.

I also have to wonder about what the effect of removing that much
energy from this universe is. It could make the difference between an
open and closed universe. Not good.

Finally, I can use such a heatsink as a superweapon. Set up a *big* one
inside a nickel-iron asteroid. get it to chill the asteroid to 3K or
less. Then drop the asteroid into the star. It\'ll *stay at 3K, and fall
to the center. And it\'ll start sucking energy out of the star. 

On the down side, it\'ll take a *long* time for the star to collapse.

We are talking about two different kinds of "realistic" here. The
arguments on the list tend to be "that violates the laws of physics"
*or* "that\'s not likely to match the way *technology* will evolve".

Those are two *very* different topics. Traveller only violates the laws
of physics in two places. Jump drive, and thruster plates. Jump drive
is kinda necessary for good stories, so it is "allowed" as long as it
is *consistent* (just like in most SF) just for the sake of getting on
with the story. And Physics *does* have some loopholes that might allow
FTL.

Thruster plates are a different matter. They are hard to justify, and
open up *way* too many cans of worms. While physics does have a few
loopholes that would allow something *like* thrusters, they\'d have to
work rather differently. 

CG is not impossible. Though again it\'d work somewhat differently based
on what we know. But unlike thruster plates, the difference *isn\'t*
enough to cause major problems (they\'d counteract a fixed amount of
pull, not a fixed *percentage* of pull)

Meson guns can\'t work with mesons, but it\'s not impossible (just really
unlikely) for there to be particles that act that way.

Sorry, but that *is* whole the noise cancellers work.

No. They have to measure the *waveform*, not the frequency. And you
have to *compute* the canceling waveform (admittedly, it\'s going to be
via an analog computer, but it still takes time).

To put it another way, what the sound cancellers are measuring is *not*
frequency. They are measuring relative air pressure (ie the height of
the peaks and troughs in the waves). They drive the emitters to create
matching but opposed peaks and troughs. So when they measure a peak of
so many micropascals, they create a trough of the same number of
millipascals. This requires microsecond by microsecond measurement.

For EM, the corresponding trick is to measure the EM *field strength*,
and compute and emitting fields with the opposite sign, but the same
strength. 

You are not canceling *frequencies* here. You are canceling *waves*.

It works with *sound*, because the circuitry generating the damping
signals works at a fraction of the speed of light! You can\'t do it with
EM radiation because your signal processing gear is *slower* than the
signal you are trying to mask.

It doesn\'t matter if they are "known". The signal coming out of them is
essentially *random*. That means you need to *measure* the signal and
*compute* the dampening signal. And by the time you do that, it is too
late, the signal is meters away from the ship. You need FTL computers
and wiring to pull off EM masking by counterphased wave emission.

If you mix red light and green light you get a mix of red and green
light. The human *eye* will see it as a different color. Sensors won\'t.

It can\'t be "averaged". It has to be *exactly* 180 degrees out of
phase, otherwise it doesn\'t cancel. You have to *measure* and then
compute the canceling signal INCLUDING ALLOWING FOR HOW IT CHANGES
BETWEEN WHERE YOU MEASURED IT AND WHERE THE CANCELING EMITTERS ARE.
Then you have to tell the emitters to emit it. And speed of light lag
kills the whole idea.

Easy, by *definition* a heat sink is something *colder* than what you
have it attached to. One of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics sets
a max value for the energy you can extract from the temp difference
between a heat source and a heat sink, based on the temp difference. 

So, since there *is* a temp difference, and one that is essentially
fixed, you can extract energy from the flow of heat between them. Since
you were talking about a heat sink that can be used to cool the ship to
look like the background (3K) it has to be *less* than 3K. And that
means you can extract a *lot* of energy from the difference in temp
between 300K and <3K. 

Also, since you can get rid of the heat *fast*, apparently you can do
so by conduction or convection, rather than via radiation. So that
makes the power source even better.

There\'s a big difference between "heat storage" and "energy storage".
While heat *is* energy, it\'s also the "lowest" form of energy. You can
only extract energy from heat by letting heat flow from a high temp to
a low temp. 

And "heat storage" is a problem. As soon as the "storage" device gets
hotter inside than whatever you are trying to move heat into it from,
it takes energy to "pump" the heat into it. And that energy is
determined by that same formula I mentioned before. Only thing is, in
this casem rather than setting a maximum, it is setting a *minimum*.
And as the temp difference increases, the energy requirements *skyrocket*.

You also need very good insulation to keep the heat from leaking out. 

You *could* use this as an energy storage device, but it\'d be
*hideously* inefficient.

Right up to the point where they reach max energy capacity. At which
point they explode and take the ship with them. :-)

You misunderstand the sort of situation he\'s talking about. They aren\'t
trying "let\'s beat the rules". They just noticed that the rules should
let them do something that they think would be useful (or at least
"neat"). So they sit down and figure out the details according to the
rules they\'ve been given.

Naturally, they are going to be rather upset when told "no, you can\'t
do that even though the rules say that you can". They\'ve wasted time
and effort, and worse, they\'ve found that they can\'t count on the rules
without checking with the ref first. That *really* gets folks upset.

Ask any *published* popular author what he thinks of lit classes. Be
prepared to have your ears scorched off. 

The "only change *one* thing" rule is a *standard* convention of SF.
Has been for 60 years or more. A few things like FTL travel are
allowable as "gimmees" if they make the story easier (this assumes that
they are inconsequential plot points).

The reason that you only change one thing is that this gives the reader

> Traveller is a lot more space opera than science fact....

Sorry, but it has *from the beginning* been more hard SF than space
opera. For one thing, in Traveller, the heros aren\'t "virtually
invulnerable" (compare any Traveller character to Kimball Kinnison).
For another, characters aren\'t pulling new bits of super science out of
their hats every time you turn around. *Those* are the hallmarks of
space opera. I enjoy reading it. But it\'s not that much fun to play.

Thrusters were a mistake (IMO). .01c rocks *can* be done given the Oort
cloud, Jump drive, and enough credits. Most SF has broken economics. 

But if this was a "space opera" game, we wouldn\'t be arguing about
these things because in space opera you aren\'t supposed to worry about
the little details!

The fact that we *are* discussing them shows that we are trying to
*keep* the SF as "hard" as it was intended to be.

The shuttle first launched in 1981. The prototype, Enterprise, flew
in 1977, if memory serves. The computer technology for Columbia, given
these dates, should have been late 1970\'s because NASA\'s contractors
would have improved upon Enterprise.

Now, when did Apple form? Right around then, no?

Try reading Samuel R. Delaney\'s "Nova" sometime, for a feeling of what a
far future tech could be. We\'re NOT talking about no %$#@ \'ten years in
the future cyberpunk\', we\'re talking 3000+ years!

In "Nova" there\'s one character that expresses disbelief that there\'s
anyone who doesn\'t have neural jacks...much less an entire group (one of
the characters is a Gypsy, a real live Romany from old Terra, and they
don\'t get the jacks implanted. As a result they can\'t get work, and are
persecuted fairly badly)

There\'s also a short discussion about how the invention of the neural
jacks vastly changed the concept of \'work\' for most people.

There are other things in there as well, that can lend a great deal of
flavor to a Traveller campaign.

The problems I\'m having with all this "future technology" is that somehow
EVERYTHING gets turned into a stagnant Vilani state for the next couple of
thousand years, that somehow the pace of technological change slows to a
crawl...why is everyone assuming that year Zero looks like 2010 with
JumpDrives? or worse, 1997 with jumpdrives, fusion and antigravity (flying
frogs excepted)?

We have advanced what, two, three tech levels in this century alone in
many areas, so why is the assumption made that the future looks so much
like today, or that what we percieve as limits are in fact true limits?

Why do I get the feeling that, to many people, the world of Traveller
resembles nothing so much as a 1960\'s GM pipe dream with better art?

A point that people seem to miss (or is it the media) Scientists are
human. Scientists lie, scientists bend arms,
and argue to make there point, just like any other orginisation.  They
disagree and agree on various points and theories.  Also, the rules of
scince change.  The rules of the game at the moment are Einsteins, and his
rules are built up on his predecossors ideas - but things can change, and
usually quite suddenly.

Please dont get me wrong Leonard, all the points you made were valid, and
we really dont have anything beyond science for things like space battles
etc, but science can be wrong.  Actually it can be really wrong.

Notes
The Crimson class is Aurelian Industries latest offering to the Imperial
Navy.  Following in the tradition of its "big brother," the DE-7
Gilaadin-class Destroyer Escort, the Crimson class continues the tradition
of partnership between Aurelian Industries and the Imperial Navy.

Designed to provide the maximum in independence, the Crimson relies on
proven laser technology to give maximum firepower with a minimum of
starport support.  The powerful INSW-23XL Bay Laser serves as the "mailed
fist" of the Crimson, giving the vessel firepower equivalent to many
smaller ships of the line found in the hinterlands of space.  Supported by
two synchronized batteries of high-powered military lasers, the Crimson
also boasts a missile barbette and master fire director.  To further
support the independent operations concept of the Crimson, the ship is also
equipped with a 5-ton missile locker adjacent to the missile barbette.
With a fully loaded barbette and missile locker, the Crimson can employ
missiles in numerous engagements before requiring resupply.

But the Crimson is not just weapons; it is also a home to nearly 30
Imperial Navy officers and men.  Because of this, Aurelian Industries has
spared no effort or expense toward providing an impressive defensive array
for this vessel.  The first element of this array is speed; the Crimson is
rated at 5G; nearly as fast as the agile gunboats and fighters of the
Imperial Navy.  In addition, the Crimson is sheathed in the latest Imperial
Meson Screen technology, and defended by three point-defense sandcasters
and nuclear dampers.  Should these defenses prove insifficient, the crew of
the Crimson is also defended by the ship\'s armor and enhanced structure,
which allows the vessel to maneuver at the peak of its powerful drive
capacity and still absorb punishment.

The independent operations concept that drives the weapons and defenses of
the Crimson also drive other aspects of the design.  The ship is built on
an airframe hull, and is fully capable of all intra- and extra- atmospheric
operations.  With the Crimson\'s fuel sccops and purifiers, the ship can
fill its tanks and fly almost immediately, and be ready to jump in just
over a day.  The ship also has a small cargo area available for carrying
additional rations or supplies, for longer-range voyages.

However, the Crimson does not have to work alone.  With its
fully-integrated bridge and advanced communications array, the ship can
operate with any sort of task force or fleet assembled by the Imperium or
its allies.  The Crimson is equipped with the finest Medium Military
sensors, allowing it to guard the flanks of a larger fleet, or detect foes
while acting independently.  Operating in conjunction with a squadron of
other Crimson-class vessels, the ship can coordinate the search of an
entire planetary system.  To aid in this, four additional staterooms are
provided to accomodate a squadron commander and his staff, or a squad of
Imperial Marines for boarding actions.  With only minor modifications, the
four spare rooms can also be converted into larger rooms for transporting
VIPs, or converted into additional storage or recreational facilities for
the crew on a long patrol.  The ship has 20 staterooms; 12 are used by the
ship\'s enlisted crew in double-capacity, and four are used by the ships
officers in single-capacity.

DESIGNERS NOTES
Per the April THUDDD announcement, the following requirements had to be
met:

1. Must be capeable of standing alone against groups of pirate/raiding
vessels.

2. Must be able to work in conjunction with larger fleet actions.

3. Must be capeable of wilderness refueling (Either directly or small
craft)

4. Must be cost effective (not necessarily cheap or inexpensive).

5. Required Minimums/Maximums:
       Size:  600 tons maximum
      Jump:  2 minimum        Maneuver:  2 minimum
     Cargo:  Minimal          Carried Craft:  As Needed
   Offense:  Above Average          Defense:  Superior
      Crew:  Must have full medical facility.
             Must provide quarters for additional command personnell.
                   (For inspections, and transport)

Requirement 1 is met by the VERY powerful main gun (the 50-ton laser bay),
supported by two smaller laser batteries and a missile launcher.  The
missile launcher is even provided additional tonnage for more missiles.

Requirement 2 is met by the ship\'s "standard" Jump 2 rating, and well above
standard 5G rating.  In addition, while the Crimson class has a weapon good
enough to attack small capital ships, it is equipped with very good
sensors, allowing it to be used as a picket ship on the fringes of the
fleet, supporting the larger Destroyers and Destroyer Escorts.  The ship
also carries the best commounications available for a ship of this size,
allowing it to remain in contact with the rest of the fleet.

Requirement 3 is met via the fuel scoops and fuel purifier.  The Crimson
class has an airframe hull, allowing it to refuel from a Gas Giant, or land
on a world with available water supplies for refueling there.

Requirement 4 is very subjective, but I feel it is also met.  At just under
700 MCr, the Crimson class is not "cheap."  However, it is tasked with a
mission far more extensive than that of the "Classic" Traveller Patrol
Cruiser.  That vessel was equipped to handle customs/patrol work and light
anti-piracy duties.  It would never have been able to meet Requirement 1,
and its meeting Requirement 2 would be questionable (in my opinion).  In
reality, the craft described in these requirements is closer to a Destroyer
Escort from "Classic" Traveller.  For 700 MCr, the Imperium is getting a
vessel that can be used independently or in small groups for
commerce/patrol work, or even for heavy anti-piracy actions.  Most pirate
vessels will skimp on defenses in favor of space for loot/prisoners, or in
favor of room for boarding troops.  Their offensive weapons will be better,
but it would be doubtful that your "average" pirate would be carrying a
50-ton Laser Bay.  Those pirates large enough or successful enough to carry
such armament would be the targets of a naval task force with several
Destroyers, at least, not one or two Patrol Cruisers.  The Patrol Cruiser
would need the firepower to knock out a light opponent or discourage a
medium opponent, and the defenses and speed to survive and run away from a
heavy opponent.  The Crimson class can fulfill all of these needs, and by
that token is Cost Effective.

Requirement 5 is also met.  The Crimson class is 600 tons, Jump 2, 5G, has
heavy firepower and good defenses, and has a sickbay.  There are additional
rooms for carried troops or inspectors, and since the ship has an Airframe
hull no carried craft are needed.  The minimal cargo capacity is enough to
provide additional rations for an extended patrol, and the missile locker
allows the ship to replenish the missles in its Missile Barbette when
required.

Actually you can.  Just as you can turn low grade heat into
high grade heat by putting energy in (this is refrigeration).
After all, a simple example would be to just use a heat
pump to make a high grade heat resevoir that you use
to make electricity (and power a laser).  Less "Rub
Goldbergesque" approaches would use the same
thermodynamics.

YOu can\'t reverse entropy of the _universe_.  You can
reverse entropy of a specific system at the cost of
energy.

We are talking about not using black body emmision rather

Some large chunk of your ship\'s exterior has to be *far* hotter than the
ambient background (3 K far from a world or star, hotter close to either),
or you won\'t lose heat energy fast enough.  The net energy flow between a
heat source and a heat sink is proportional to the *fourth power* of the
temperature difference between them.  You either need a high temperature
in small area, or a lowish (but nowhere near 3K) temp. in a much larger
area (like the "stealth balloon" someone proposed), for the same power
level.

Norris was not gay. The man was asexual in the extreme. His life was his people. 
The basis for this was his lack of a sex life detailed in TNE. 
Just because a man isn\'t ruled by his nards does not mean the man is gay

last 2 minutes in a modern war and infantry won\'t survive 3 seconds in a high intensity 
battle. The US airforce got its ass kicked in early dogfighting over Viet Nam because 
they felt that cannons were obsolete. Nimble MiGs got inside the missile envelope and 
peppered the US superjet with old fashioned bullets (big ones, but still bullets)
Everytime someone says, "that is obsolete", a use is usually found for it or more likely it 
was found to fill a niche that hasn\'t yet been filled by new stuff

Yes, that\'s it, except that when First Survey is reprinted, it will be 
hardbound with Milieu 0 (which will have the missing material that was 
left out of the first printing - deckplans for the Scout Cruiser, and so 
on), plus I\'m told we (CORE) have permission to add a chapter on how to 
interpret UWP\'s, as well as how to read the FS data (i.e., what does 
"PBG" mean).  By interpret, I mean, "What is a planet with a small size, 
standard, untainted atmosphere, and 20 billion people likely to be like," 
"What does Gov type 8 with LL 0 mean"  and so on.  An aid to the 
imagination, obviously mostly for beginners.


> Are there any timescales for this yet?

Not that I know of. I know Marc and IG want to get T4 Deluxe out Real 
Soon Now.  I\'ve heard May bandied about, but I dunno how realistic that 
is, given the amount of work involved in fixing that book.

I know we\'ll start working on M0/FS in May (soon as Stu and I are done 
with Psionic Institutes).  Should be able to get that done rather 
quickly, but I dunno when they\'ll be able to print it up.  Printing stuff 
up has some variables involved - money for one, distributor willingness 
to buy is another (i.e., if you print up four new books in one month, are 
the distributors going to buy them all in sufficient quantities?  or 
should you spread them out?).

As for Starships, I have no idea at all.  That one will be Marc\'s 
project, to my understanding, which means he won\'t be starting it until 
he\'s done with T4 Deluxe, at the earliest.

	One good reason for storing straight LH instead of embedding it in
fiber-tanks or straight water: MASS! 1 metric ton of LH may take up more
volume than 1 metric ton of H in H20 form, but it masses less--since the
mass ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in water is 1:8, to get 1t of LH you have
to carry NINE tons of water. There\'s a significant difference. Sure, my
fighter may need 14 cubic meters to store 1 ton of hydrogen, but I can do
that with a lot less MASS (even counting the tank dry mass) than your
fighter can with its 1 cubic meter of water. And since acceleration REALLY
depends on mass, not volume, I\'m better off.

	Another question is how you get a one-to-one mapping from 3D to 2D (i.e.
each point in realspace corresponds to exactly one point in jumpspace, and
vice-versa).

Someone approaching Earth would have another advantage on their side,
gravity. One could approach engines off, glide in, and use stored energy for
breaking.

As for EMM, I\'d be hesitant to speculate.

Mike, take a look at David Weber\'s Honor Harrington stories.  His STL/FTL
is gravity based.  For FTL he uses "sails" in hyperspace to sail along
"gravity waves." His STL is based on a pair of wedges of ultra-high gravity
placed above and below the ship which squeeze it forward at several hundred
g..man those grav compensators must be GOOD! ;->  I find Weber\'s structure
compelling...and not all that far from Traveller conventions.

If you don\'t mind playing in an entirely different universe you might want
to look at Space 1889..not necessarily for the background, but for the
technological ideas.  There ether exists as a papable substance and ships
can use ether propellers (and with a tweek sails) to maneuver around a
system.  There isn\'t a FTL, but that *could* be jump.  

Someday, somehow, I\'m going to run a campaign with ether screws!  That
would be  just *too* nifty for words. ;->

Yes, that\'s true. As I also mentioned, I\'d think long and hard about
allowing a beam of waste heat.  Heck, no, I wouldn\'t!  I\'d say, "Oh sure!

How do you feel about "Ether Propellers?"  I\'m just going to *have* do that
one of these days!  

Actually, I\'m thinking about a PBEM this summer, I\'ll put you on the list
of people that are interested if you want.  

I won\'t be using Thruster plates or much of the \'canon\' background. I\'m
leaning toward STL stutterwarp, AG/CG with very low thrust beyond low
orbit, FTL jump drive, and a couple of alternate energy technologies.  The
game will take place during *a* long (much longer) night, and center around
a exploratory merchant crew working on the Quental Main.  Something of a
swashbuckler.

Yes.  That\'s one reason for refereed journals and the necessity for
reproducibility for any theory to be accepted -- to keep science free from
the personal biases of scientists.  :-)

> Also, the rules of scince change.

No.  The scientific method has remained fairly constant for centuries
(before you try it, Aristotle did not practice science).  The rules of
science remain the same, it\'s only our perceptions of the universe, and
our ever-closer approximations to it, which alter.

No.  We only learn new rules for special cases.  Newton was not "wrong":
just imprecise.  We now have better rules for handling very small or very
fast objects... but Newton is as accurate as most folks need for everyday
ranges of speed and size.  As Leonard already said, Einstein\'s equations
simplify into Newton\'s for "normal" ranges of mass and speed.

> science can be wrong.  Actually it can be really wrong.

Science can be wrong about special cases.  But no-one is going to prove
tomorrow that gravity doesn\'t exist and doesn\'t pull things "down"-wards.
Or that changing magnetic fields don\'t produce electrical fields, etc.
Science builds upon its predecessors, it does not eat them.

IIRC, NASA "froze" shuttle technology at 1971 levels so they could design
the platforms without having to chase the cutting edge of technology. The
thought was that Shuttle II could be designed in the 80\'s with late 70\'s
technology and come online shortly thereafter, followed by Shuttle III,
followed by...didn\'t work out that way.  

I blame Mondale and Proxmire for it all!  If they hadn\'t been so "pound
poor, penny rich" the Shuttle would have had a crewed and completely
reusable liquid fuel lower stage. The front end cost would have been
higher, but the operating costs would have been lower..the main engines
wouldn\'t have to throttle at over 100%, there would have been a complete
downrange recoverability, and the dang explosion wouldn\'t have happened.

Yeah, I get knots in my stomach just thinking about Mondale and Proxmire.

Maybe here is the solution to the killer lifeboat problem?  A bit of my
rusty old calculus gives a ship\'s velocity v = (2Pt/m)^0.5, where t is the
number of seconds of continuous thrust, m the mass in kg of the ship
itself, and P the power being applied continuously to the thruster plates.
(Obviously, this assumes 100% efficiency, which our photon-producing
plates do not achieve.  Season to taste).

An earlier step in the process yielded dv/dt = (T/(2mt))^0.5, so, sure
enough, under continuous thrust, as t goes to infinity, dv/dt (the rate
of change of velocity with respect to time, aka acceleration) goes to 0.
Thruster plates, according to their current definition, have a "speed
limit" of sorts which they should approach asymptotically.  I don\'t have
any books handy to check the figures: is the speed limit a reasonable one?
This is complicated for regular use, but I kind of like the feel of it!

For those interested in the math nastiness, or who want to see if I\'ve
made any mistakes:

Let m and M be the masses of the ship and star, and v and V their
velocities.  Let E be the energy introduced into the ship-star system
by the thruster plates (itself described by P*t, t in seconds and
representing the time of thrust applied).

We must conserve momentum, so mv = -MV.  And, as Leonard pointed out, we
have to conserve energy (fusion power transformed into kinetic energy of
both star and ship, here), so E = 0.5*MV^2 + 0.5*mv^2.

So, 0.5*mv^2 = E - 0.5*MV^2

    v^2 = 2E/m - (M/m)V^2
        = 2E/m - (M/m)(mv/M)^2 from momentum conservation.
        = 2E/m - (m/M)v^2

Time to corral those v\'s again:

    v^2 + (m/M)v^2  = 2E/m
    v^2 * (1 + m/M) = 2E/m

Now, note that, for just about any case you can name, m << M, that is, a
ship is of insignificant mass next to a star (I believe I quoted ballpark
figures of 1E6 kg for a small ship next to 1E30 kg for a Sun-like star:
twenty-four orders of magnitude is a lot!).  So (1 + m/M) is as close to
one as makes no difference, and without introducing any significant error
we can just write v^2 = 2E/m.  So:

   v = (2E/m)^.5

   dv/dt = 0.5 * (2E/m)^-0.5 * 2/m * dE/dt

Now, dE/dt, accourding to our earlier definitions, is a constant: it\'s the
rate at which energy is being continuously introduced into the system by
the thruster plates.  So dE/dt can simply be written P.  Which gives us:

   dv       P           P          P^0.5     (  P  )^0.5
   -- = ---- = ---- = ---- = (----)
   dt   (2Em)^0.5   (2Ptm)^0.5   (2mt)^0.5   ( 2mt )

And integrating gives us v = (2Pt/m)^0.5.  Voila.

I\'ve a question for the list, regarding experience advancement. It\'s
really independent from the system you use (T4, revised T4, KBv2.X,
Yatts whatever).

According to the rules, players may test advancement for skill
used in an adventure. Being a "wildcard" skill, JOT will be used
fairly often, and therefore will be probably eliglible for skill
testing. Just consider someone which has JOT but hasn\'t Perception,
for example.

Even if you aren\'t a powergamer, the idea of advancing such a
versatile skill will probably seem a good one, and I expect people to
apply a lot of their experience checks towars JOT advancement.

What do you suggest? Do you allow JOT checks when it is used as
replacement for toher skills? And if this is not the case, when (if
at all) do you allow checking for it? Can you describe a legitimate
use of JOT as a skill in itself?

Skill levels are useful during character generation, but we don\'t need to
carry them over into game play.  Here\'s a more simple idea: Everytime a
single point of experience is earned...(a) increase the Point and Asset
total by 1; (b) divide the Points by 3, rounded down for the current Skill
Level.

Example: 

Just after character generation...

Attribute = 7

Skill     Level  Points    Asset
Pilot       2       6    6 + 7 = 13

After earning two points of skill...

Level = 8/3,dn = 2.67 = 2

Skill     Level  Points    Asset
Pilot       2       8    8 + 7 = 15


After earning one more point of skill...

Level = 9/3,dn = 3

   This story is legit.  I checked out TSR\'s Web site and they confirmed
it.  Here is some additional info from TSR:
- ----
Ramifications?

Right now, we still don\'t have a whole lot of information. However,
there are certain questions that can be answered right now.

What does this mean for AD&D?
AD&D is a valuable commodity for which Wizards is certain to want to
continue to produce products.

What about the late products & magazines?
It is most likely that shipping will resume once the negotiations
between the two companies are completed (estimated 6-8 weeks).

What about Gen Con?
Gen Con will take place on schedule in Milwaukee.

What about Gen Con program books & housing forms?
They will still be going out in May.

How come the web site said that TSR wasn\'t being bought, but it actually
was?
Because only upper management of the two companies knew what was going
on; everything else was rumor and supposition.

Other than for these questions, we don\'t have any answers at this time.
In other words, if you don\'t see the answer to your question here, the
answer is 

"We don\'t know yet."

When we get answers, they will be posted here (sorry, we won\'t be making
personal replies because the volume of repeat questions is going to be
very high). Until then, please don\'t bombard us with questions we can\'t
answer. We know the most common questions; we\'ll give answers when we
get them.

   It would appear that GDW has been avenged.  It also appears that
TSR\'s name will be fading away.  I\'d like to say they\'ll be missed--I
would be lying.  While TSR did give the world many hours of
entertainment (including a few here and there for me), they also engaged
in business practices (especially early on) that were of a questionable
nature.  While these tactics served to secure TSR\'s market position,
they also made the RPG industry less robust, keep prices at a premium,
and ultimately help to lead to TSR\'s own apparent demise.  The next few
days and months should prove interesting.

I think you\'ve made a hasty generalization. Science isn\'t "an 
organization". Scientists do not (as a group) "lie". They don\'t 
(generally) come up with fabricated facts to fit their "theories". There 
are bad apples in every profession, but well established scientific 
theories do not turn out to be plain "wrong".

To use your example of Einstein, his theories did not prove Newton\'s Laws 
wrong, they only proved Newton\'s Laws to be an approximation, a *subset* 
of Relativity, reasonably accurate within certain parameters.

I agree with Leonard in that certain well established laws (The 3 Laws of 
Thermo spring to mind) which are known to be true in all known 
circumstances, should not be violated without a *lot* of thought to the 
consequences.

I think it takes a lot more imagination to find a way to advance the plot 
of the story by adhering to how the universe works, then just chalking it 
up to "magic".

On the other hand, If you don\'t realize that you\'re violating some 
physical law in some way, and no one else does (or cares), have fun.

But the main reason why I subscribe to this list is for the "reality 
check" people like Leonard and many others give me. And the many weird 
and wacky ideas that make it though that "reality check" in *my* head, 
which may or may not be the same as everyone on this list.

So to those scientists on the list, (physical, social, and armchair) 
carry on!

I\'m listening...

How was Aristotle, "not a scientists" for all intents and purposes?
Because the definition didnt exist then?  I disagree whole heartedly.
Aristotelian science was around for almost 2500 years until the time of
galileo and his contemporaries and academic descendents.

He followed the Empirical method, so his a scientist.

I disagree (again, this is a habit with me :)  But since you wont accept
aristotle as an example of science being wrong, how about phlogiston, that
was wrong, where was the new rule for that?  How about (his name escapes
me) <blank>  just after galileo and copernicous, he said that the sun goes
around the earth, but everything else goes around the sun.  That was just
plain wrong.

True, i cant imagine gravity being disregarded tomorrow, but it wouldnt
surprise me if it was changed or disregarded in the future.  Whos to say
that when we reach the speed of light (or if) that something completely
different happens.  

Another example, the double helix genetic model that
people are use to, anyone who does advanced studies into biology (spec.
genetics) will tell you that multiple models exist for it, its just that
the double helix is the easiest to understand and "works".

Ive even heard heated debate between physcists about the existence of the
electron (or proton, cant remember).  If scientists argue over premises
that we take for granted, then what makes you think that science cant be 
"wrong" about a field of things?  

Please dont misunderstand me, im not flaming you or writing you off, its
just that your average joe puts a little to much faith into science for
little reason.

That\'s it! A reason for misjumps!

Gravitational wells restrict the map from realspace-->jumpspace. 
One-to-one correspondence does not exist. So a misjump is a ship 
"approximating" the closest match, the position selected in jumpspace 
maps to an unintended destination in realspace.

I\'ve said this before, rather recently, and won\'t repeat it next time this
issue comes up, but...

Traveller needs to be playable by newbies who wander into a room, get a
20-minute briefing on background by a distracted GM, then start into their
first scenario.  For that to work, Traveller *has* to be "late 20th
century industrialized Terra, plus J-drive, gravitics, and better power
sources."  Not merely the technology, but the sociology and the
(rudimentary) economics have to be, at root, here and now with minor
tweaks.

A good, daring SF story can attempt to portray what society *might* be
like in just a few decades or centuries, if the tech curve continues its
exponential climb.  Vinge\'s _Across Realtime_ comes to mind, Varley\'s
"Ten Worlds" future history, Stephensons\'s _The Diamond Age_, and a few
others accomplish this, but it\'s tought to pull off -- because the
characters in the novel have utterly different knowledge and assumptions
about the world than the reader does.  Of the works mentioned above, only
Varley just tosses the reader in to sink or swim; Stephenson starts his
protagonist as a very young girl, whose education and socialization the
reader gets to share, and Vinge contrives to include some late-1990s
viewpoint characters who can ask questions about things the reader needs
to have explained.  This strategey can be used in roleplaying as well, but
it doesn\'t tend to translate well.

Running a *really* advanced/different society is extremely hard on the GM
as well, as he ends up having to hold an entirely self-consistent
alternate society in his head and/or notebook -- and, unlike an author,
his players can throw random curveballs at him, to which he must react
without more than a few moments of preparation.  Given how few authors can
handle the arguably easier task of crafting a society populated by
characters they themselves control, one can extrapolate that the number of
GMs capable of doing justice to such a campaign is *very* small.

So, yes, it\'s absurd that the Third Imperium looks so much like California
ca. 1997.  But there\'s no real choice in the matter.

Theories can and DO turn out to be wrong, thats whay there Theories and
not Laws.  

Its not a generalisation at all.  Scientists are human, when they band
together they make a human orginisation, what pray tell, is the difference
between a small corporation and a band of scientists in an orginisational
sense?

They argue, they make deals, they bend arms - heck they\'lll even lie and
cheat if there character is like that.  Science works like most other
human orginisations.  Compromise and tradeoffs.  Just read "The double
Helix" for a prime example of what im talking about.

Smae reason as me, i learned a lot from the fighter vs bb debate because
there are a lot of different specialists on the list.  So do carry on by
all means.

Not only that, but how \'low-tech\' it is.  3000 yrs is a long time; long enough

Wearing your technology is the way to go.  All this will be donned with no more 
thought than the average person straps on a wristwatch, and will be as easy to 
handle.  someone (a while back) posted an idea for a \'computer cloth\' that could
be cut and sewn, that was imprinted with circuits and cpu\'s.  Might want to 
search the archives for that...

How about holoprojectors on the headband that transmits directly into the eye, 
or using special contacts that act as data output devices?

What\'s so complicated?  

When a character goes up due to experience, his experience score is 
raised one point (which raises his target number one point).

After he gets three such raises, his skill level is increased by one.

That\'s it.

It seems much more simple than what you are proposing.

Am I missing something?

I have always *dreamed* of playing in a Space:1899 game!  The whole idea
is just too lovely.  I think my favorite small detail of such a world is
the heliograph station on Phobos, for relaying messages between the
Martian surface and Earth. :)

But even absent the full, gloriously absurd Space:1899 background, ether
propellers in and of themselves are a beautiful idea.  Powered by refined
phlogiston, perhaps...?

Please do!  I\'ve been moaning and wailing about being just too busy to
jump into Mark Clark\'s "Beltwatch" game...this\'ll give me something to
look forward to instead for the summer, when I should be at least a little
bit less overwhelmed [Craig pauses to knock wood].

Sound great!  I know this is off-topic for the TML, but one of my favorite
pieces of color from 2300 AD is (and I don\'t recall if this was ever
officially pointed out) the visual effect of a ship pulling alongside you
using stutterwarp at >c.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, the ship is just
*there*...then, very rapidly, a flickering series of images of the ship
recedes along the line of travel the ship just traversed, vanishing
quickly into the distance.  Something gloriously surreal about that.

Norris\'s orientation was first hinted at in DGP\'s The MegaTraveller
Journal#1 (1991) in an article called Norris Interview, set in the year
1120, (pg 42-5) which was written by Rob Caswell & _Mark_Miller_ One of
the questions is:

Mark Shiguulli (the interviewer): Getting back to the successor question
for a second, is there any specific reason you\'ve remained unmarried
(Norris is 57 at the time) ?

Archduke Norris Aledon: Not aside from the obvious ones. I\'ve never met
anyone who I felt strongly enough towards to make that kind of
commitment and I\'ve never had the time to step up the search. (Norris
grins) I had Seldrian (Norris\'s female clone & sole heir) because it
became apparent that such an action was my duty.

Norris answer when asked if there is any reason he has never married is
"Not aside from the obvious ones. I\'ve never met anyone (notice he does
not say any _woman_ ) who I felt strongly enough towards..."  Being gay
is one of the obvious reasons not to get married (at least to a member
of the opposite sex).  This question and it\'s answer did not sound very
different from the answers closeted gay movie stars give.

Norris\'s orientation was fairly firmly established in TNE\'s Regency
Sourcebook where it says "Norris never really recovered from the death
of his trusted advisor Branj Dilgaadin in 1146, and it os believed that
the long and close psionic relationship he had with his seneschal made
it that much more difficult for him to form relationships later in life,
most of all with marriageable women." Norris wrote a poetic ode to Branj
which he read at Branj\'s funeral

	"I never ruled alone through all the trials that we fought,
For you were there beside me, you knew my every thought. 
Amid challenges and crises more than one man could withstand,
You were my second body; my unseen mind and hand.
But now your place lies empty, both without me and within,
And to rule alone is something I don\'t know how to begin.
I would find a queen, who like you, shares my purpose and my thought,
But how can I know another, when I know that she could not ?

This ode is a pretty clear indication of Norris\'s love for Dilgaadin.

A life long bachelor with no close relationships with women who rejects
them because they could not be a close as he was with another man.  I
don\'t see any doubt that Norris is gay.

Since Norris\'s heir and clone, Seldrian, shares his genes & most current
genetic evidence suggests (although does not prove) that homosexuality
is primarily genetic we can probably assume that she was also gay.  This
might be part of the reason why her marriage to Avery Alledon (Emporer
Strephons son) failed and their only child was conceived in vitro,
although the facts that Avery was 20 years younger and that the marriage
was a political one are other factors.

Arrival Vengence suggests, in the chapter on Strephon, that the Emporer
Strephon knew of Norris\'s homosexuality.  Certain of his comments to the
players about Norris need for a heir and how his clone was a good
solution to the problem suggest he knew the traditional method was out
for Norris.

serving as waiters and such at state functions is straight from the
documentary on the Britannia.  They showed one fellow, assigned to the
ship for only six weeks, who was a medical tech but was all dressed up and
tasked to serve wine to the guests at dinner.  According to the program,
it works, because since there are so many of the crew working at serving
the dinner, each has only a simple job (at least the ones who are normally
crew), and since a trained steward is always nearby, there are no
problems.  

  Note also that most of those who serve as crew are there for a
long time - the Britannia does not rotate crewmembers to the fleet like
normal ships.  Most folks stay with the ship for a large chunk of their
careers, they come as experienced seamen already, and they are selected as
an elite group.  According to the program, it was not uncommon for
crewmembers to have 10, 15, or even 20 years service aboard the Britannia.

  Where did Cleon I get folks like that?  From his own personal yacht, of
course.  He also has the pick of crewmembers from the entire inperial
navy.  I\'d be pretty confident his crew (all pretty smart cookies, I\'ll
bet) can handle the job.

Gibson uses something called virtual light which according to his book
notes is an actual research system. Some gizmo stimulate the optic nerve
directly bypassing the retina and this is done "wireless". I have no idea

How do you feel a "focussed magnetic field"? By inpmanting ferrous sand in
your fingertips or what. How do you focus a magnetic field over large
distances (1 meter or so)?

	Hummm... too general. They cannot have advanced technical skills, that\'s

Ahhhhhg... I cannot resist. I\'m gonna answer.

Well, I am a mathematician, so,  taking into account that these calculations
are always very delicate, its almost sure (i.e., with probability one ;-) )
that I will make a mistake on the following, but one could systematically
proceed along the following lines (yeah, there are conditional probability
formulas, but they are too messy for a problem like this):

Possible outcomes when throwing 4D = 6**4 (six to the 4th)
Outcomes with exactly 4 sixes: 1
Outcomes with exactly 3 sixes = outcomes where one and only one die is not a
six = 4 x 5 (any of the 4 dice, any of the 5 numbers 1...5)
Total outcomes with 3 or 4 sixes when throwing 4D = S(4)=21
Prob(3 or more sixes on 4D) = 21/(6**4) = 0.016203703

Possible outcomes when throwing 5D= 6**5 (six to the 5th)
Outcomes with exactly 5 sixes: 1
Outcomes with exactly 4 sixes = outcomes where one and only one dice is not
a six = 5 x 5 =25 (5 possible samplings of the non-six die, 5 possible
values for it)
Outcomes with exactly 3 sixes = outcomes where two and only two dice are not
sixes = (5x4/2x1) x5x5 = 250 (5x4/2x1 (i.e. the combinatorial number 2 over
5) possible samplings of the two non-six dice, 5x5 possible values for them)
Prob (3 or more sixes on 5D)= Add this three figures and divide by 6**5 =
276 / (6**5) = 0.035493827 (aprox)

Possible outcomes when throwing 6D= 6**6 (six to the 6th)
Outcomes with exactly 6 sixes: 1
Outcomes with exactly 5 sixes = outcomes where one and only one dice is not
a six = 6 x 5 = 30 (6 possible samplings of the non-six die, 5 possible
values for it)
Outcomes with exactly 4 sixes = outcomes where two and only two dice are not
sixes = (6x5/2x1) x5x5 = 375 (6x5/2x1 (i.e. the combinatorial number 2 over
6) possible samplings of the two non-six dice, 5x5 possible values for them)
Outcomes with exactly 3 sixes = ... = (6x5x4/3x2x1) x 5x5x5 = 20 x 125 = 2500
(6x5x4/3x2x1 possible samplings of 3 dice, 5x5x5 possible values for them)
Prob (3 or more sixes on 6D)= 2906/ (6**6) = 0.062285665 (aprox)

Possible outcomes when throwing 7D= 6*7 (six to the seventh)
Outcomes with exactly 7 sixes: 1
Outcomes with exactly 6 sixes = outcomes with one and only one non-six = 7x5
= 35
Outcomes with exactly 5 sixes= ... = (7x6/2x1) x 5x5 = 21x25 = 525
Outcomes with exactly 4 sixes= ... = (7x6x5/3x2x1) x 5x5x5 = 35 x 125 = 4375
Outcomes with exactly 3 sixes= ... = (7x6x5x4/4x3x2x1)  x 5x5x5x5 = 35 x 625
= 21875
Prob (3 or more sixes on 7D)= 26811 / (6**7) = 0.095775462 (aprox)

Summary: rounding in the fourth digit,

Number of dice		Prob(3 or more sixes)	Prob in %
=========================================================
4			0.0162			1.62 %
5			0.0355			3.55 %
6			0.0623			6.23 %
7			0.0958			9.48 %
=========================================================

	Unfortunately, these do not coincide with the figures that Kenneth posted
the other day. They are pretty close to those of Nick Munn, except the last,
which differs in the third digit. Tell me if I am wrong. If the figures are
right, next time I teach a Prob course, I\'ll put this in the examination <g>.

	By the way, I have always been under the impression that the percentage of
SF-roleplayers among mathematicians is higher than in the population. So,
how many mathematicians are around here? Email me privately, I will count
ourselves... ;-)

He\'s not a scientis as he did not follow the empirical method. His
assertion that men have more teeth than females for instance would easily
be falsified by exoperiments. Actually he preferred doing "science" by
thought alone.

They seem to have problems when encountering really cool temps and/or
really few particles but as termodynamics is a classical system the latter
doesn\'t apply.
With the risk of being called a lot of nasty things again I\'m wondering why
schools do not teach simple termodynamics? Newtons laws are taught in basic
school but few seem to know about termodynamics (even on this list).

with the fellow who did a history of Dyna-Soar, who was an active-duty Air

reading the program description was the part about how the pilots were
expected to land from orbit without onboard computers and were cut off
from ground guidance for a good portion of reentry due to the ionized gas
envelope surounding the ship due to the heat of reentry.  The learning
curve is pretty steep here - screw up the first time and you\'re toast.

Great! So now i completely feel like a beta-tester for Traveller!
IG seems to tell us: "Well the idea is that you buy the product, look

If i want a corrected version of FS i also have to buy M0 again??? 
Puh-Lease!
I would hope thar IG starts to adopt a SJG-like playtesting scheme, 
that includes sending pre-production data and texts out to a number 
of playtesters who can examine and critize the product BEFORE it is 
printed (I would volunteer ;-)!!! 
I would also be happy with a service that puts changes between 
versions and missing data on an Errata sheet (some sheet for FS) 
available to anyone for free! At this point, i don\'t own a T4 product 
that isn\'t going to be updated (TLWH, T4-Rules, M:0) and frankly, 
this starts pissing me off! Please make sure that errata and update 
sheets are made available free for buyers of faulty products, or 
downloadable on the web page! Pleeaaaasse (begging on my knees)! 
I find that IG\'s books are among the most expensive on the market and 
I don\'t want to have to buy all of them twice just because i want 
correct versions! We buyers deserve that!

        He he he... I am detailing them at the moment, and I will post a
summary. In fact, I thought to wait a bit to post the History and present
them first, but, as you can see, this little detail has been an excellent
reading check... now I know some people is really reading the history in
detail <G>.
        Let me advance something about \'their renown among the Geonee as
Marine troopers". The Geonee are high-G adapted, so, when artificial gravity
goes off (something fairly frequent in space combat), they are not the most
dextrous fighters. But the Llyrnians come from a size-3 planet...

Yes, but I see neural jacks (as well as most other typical cybertech) as
overly obvious and flashy solutions to problems.  If you can make an
interface headband which works almost as well and it doesn\'t require the
user to have brain surgery (even safe, easy, brain surgery) it will be a
vastly more popular option.  Cyberpunk looks clunky, after thousands of
years of use tech isn\'t going to look clunky, it will be easy to use,
conveniently sized, and highly ergonomic.

Very much agreed!  Except for some of the Digest Group material Traveller
has always seemed like 2010 with jump drive, fusion, and CG.  I would like
to see a game set thousands of years in the future be a bit more daring. 
One of my biggest disappointments was when 2300 came out and I saw that
the world of 2300 was actually in advance of the 3rd Imperium in many
ways.

Not entirely, there is on thing that I wanted to ignore, but for the
sake of game balance I can\'t the procedure to load fuel takes a long
time. Currently a to fill a 35 l tank takes several hours, OK, so that
might become more efficient later on, but it would still require a much
longer time to do than normal. Gasgiant refueling would also be more or
less ruled out since the standard way of doing it requires that you have
the fuel stored in the ship, that would be impossible with this system
since it takes so long to store. Even though the problem with unrefined
fuel would be less due to the fact that H2 molecules is just about the
only thing that fits in that small space. During fueling the tank must
be under 12 MPa pressure and afterwards the pressure must be held at 4
MPa to keep the H2 from leaking out.

Hmm, now I think I\'ve sqeezed all the info I can out of that article.

> Time to change QSDS/SSDS.

Append some stuff perhaps. I\'ve got some ideas for that.

Fuel pressurizer

As fuel purification plant only double size, but you must have a
constant supply of gas (which means that if doing GG refueling you have
to stay down there until finished) and it\'s also more expensive,
something like 4 times since it would have incorporate some nanotech too
to rejuvinate (since the problem with deteoriating fibers hasn\'t been
completely solved) the nanofibers all the time.

The fueltanks would become smaller ofcourse but how much? Could someone
perhaps give us a calculation.

One of the problems with this type of fueltank is that you can\'t use
unrefined fuel, since you don\'t have a fueltank that can contain
anything other than pure H2. This would require a ship to either have a
fuel pressurizer or skip all those ports without capacity for refined
fuel.

Just an idea...

        I feel exactly the same. The only problem is that the task system is
an integral part of MT. If you use that task system, then you have to use
the MT combat system (which, as we both know well, is quick & dirty enough
for us <g>), and that means, for instance, that Emperor\'s Arsenal is almost
useless.
        The same can be said about Character Generation. It seems that T4
characters end with significatively more skills than MT characters, so,
using the MT task system, they will be making Formidable tasks on a routine
basis, which is not good. Yeah, you can use MT character generation, which
has the advantage that then you have a nice amount of extra careers (18 in
the basic book plus all the other careers that time has added to everybody\'s
house rules).
        You see what happens. You are stuck with MT, and no more MT
supplements are going to be released...

        Personally, I agree with you. The MT task system was good enough,
and there was no need for a change. But I would like to be able to use and
understand all the T4 material with the minimum effort on my side (I prefer
to keep my spare time for developing background, not rules).

        This list has seen Marc\'s efforts for presenting a new system, and
Kenneth\'s counter-attack. I agree that maybe KBv2.0 is a good system, but,
for some non-rational reason, It\'s not really appealing for me. I want Skill
level to be the relevant number, not Experience=3xSkill level. But, still, I
do not want to add Skill+Attribute as in the T4 system, that puts too much
weight on attributes. The MT task system solved it fairly well. In fact,
maybe we could just come up with some minor modification of the MT system to
use with T4 characters... Adding 2 to the difficulty levels, or something
like that. The bad thing of having an official system and a popular
unofficial one is that then, the rules are unclear. I always restrained
myself from toying with the task system, but now, it seems that one would
not loose much by using a homebred system specifically tailored to suit own
(and only own) tastes. And, over tastes, there is no discussion.

        Internal coherence is not all. Star Wars is Internally coherent
(IMHO), but it\'s still Fantasy, not Sci-Fi. Sci-Fi should try to be at least
partially coherent with physics. Up to which point? The answer is clear for
me... up to the point where the Ref & the players don\'t know any better. In
my universe, nobody is going to travel BACK in time, and nobody is going to
beat light speed... without a lot of babblership about "jumpspace" and the
like. But I am not going to take and Advanced Chemistry Class to make sure
the mining comnplex I am designing mines the right ores...

        I agree. After all, there is only one RULE (with capital letters) in
RPG: It has to be fun. Precisely because I do not have any fun with
unexplained magics, I prefer SF-RPG. Precisely because I do not have any fun
with sublight travel, I accept Jumpspace.
        The main advantage of relying on real science for the basics of the
game universe is that the real universe is coherent (I hope!), so some of
the coherence will carry to your game automatically. We don\'t need enormous
efforts to be "realistic". Just think twice before putting a new tech gadget
in your game, and make sure it could be possible and it does not alter the
equilibrium of your universe significatively.

        But the realism/non-realism debate could go on to other fields. Most
of the time, I use rules of thumb to determine if something is being
realistic or not. For example... when is Combat realistic? Well, If a group
of 5 PCs defeat an equally armed, equally capable group of 5 NPCs, all NPCs
die, and no PC dies, then the combat HAS BEEN unrealistic. I expect at least
a couple of the PCs to die. Next time, they will seek some advantage before
entering combat.
        (At least one TMLer knows perfectly well what I am talking about
here ;-) )

Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, If you\'re going to try to slip a robot into a postion
like this, you should plan for every contingency. Sounds less like the

Well, look at how much "easier" modern watches are to set than older ones
and in 3000 years it will probably take an AI computer several years to do
it. User interfaces don\'t always improve by TL ;)

 As I don\'t plan on using the tasksystem (though good compared to T4 it
is!) maybe I shouldn\'t meddle but why keep skill levels at all when
attribute + xps is your target number? Because the char gen system has
skills? Then convert each skill to 3 xps and be done with it.

Since both 2D and 3D space are infinite that shouldn\'t bee too much of a

Ok, I was wrong there was one more thing I could squeeze out of that
article... :) anyways there\'s an example in there about a 35 l tank
(they think more about fuel for cars than for starships) it could
contain around 60 kg of H2 with a total tank weight of around 100 kg.
Sure it would weigh a lot more, but that can be offset with more
engines, which can fill up some of the released mass. It\'s all a
question of economy, the old ways are MUCH cheaper therefore they will
remain since most people won\'t have the money for the new stuff.

Agreed, this is the easiest and most effective way to build a realistic system.

Yes : Do we have other choice?

There is a limit to what we can imagine. I\'ve understood that point when I
recently read a H.Reeves book. He stated that actual science knowledge
(very high density, time-space distortion, particles, anti-matter,
emptyness of matter, black holes ...) is very hard to explain to mundane
people.

Mundane people is definied by a low knoweldge in one theory. So when a
specialist in this domain explain to the mundane guy, he cannot refer to
formulas. He has to image the thoery. (BTW images have their own
limitation). Now to understand the effects, the mundaine people have to use
their imagination. This imagination is limited to what you can see. This
limitation can only be overcome by learning all the theory (the formulas)
from the begining. In this only case we can understand what we cannot
imagine. 

So :
Mundane : Can understand everything up to his imagination
Scientist : Can understand everything up to the actual theory

Imagine the difficulty to create a RPG in a 5 dimensions environement. It
couldn\'t be usable because players couldn\'t realise the situation
(imagination limitation). Or you would have to build precise laws of
physics which apply to this 5 dimension world (theory limitation). 

Let\'s come back to our RPG game :
The theory approch is limited to 1997\'s state. So the scientist future
sight extrapolates all the actual materials (theory and equipement).
The imagination approach is limited to historical/cultural knowledge
(including mythology and magic...). So mundane future sight uses his own
cultural information as a start. But it will ever look like something we know.



My opinion is that we CANNOT imagine what will be in 3500 year from now.
But we have to define something for our RPG. We are all doing that and
that\'s why Bruce Johnson says :
>The problems I\'m having with all this "future technology" is that somehow
>EVERYTHING gets turned into a stagnant Vilani state for the next couple of
>thousand years

But Bruce, can you build a 5700\'s RPG with the 1900-1997 technological
evolution rate? As it\'s impossible, all we\'ll imagine would ever be
stagnant...

Do Aristote ever imagine that 1cm3 of matter could weight 500 000 000T? Do
he ever imagine that billions of people would communicate via computer
networks? Do he ever imagine that people would travel by train or plane? Do
he ever imagine that someone would land on moon?
Yeh, the 2000\'s RPG created by Aristote would have had a very stagnant
technological evolution too!

Other opinions?

We\'ve been using playtesters since the changeover (remember, M0 and FS 
were made when the old management was in charge; they were just printed 
afteward).  Pocket Empires had seven or so playtesters.  Psionic 
Institutes has several playtesters (no, we don\'t need any more at this

I\'ve always taken it that a group of ships leaving from the same point (say
within 0.1 LS) at the same time, with identical vectors would have the same
Jump-space transit time, and would come out in pretty much the same
formation they went in. I also generally assume that when doing this the
ships all calculate the jump, and cross-check each other, thus giving a very
accurate jump.

Then it\'s gonna take a *long* time to cool your ship to close enough 3K

Not really. That\'s what *batteries* are for. And most designs are such

Now if you get an interior hit in the antimatter storage, *that\'s* a

Well, *ships* are going to be at that equilibrium, as that is *room

Hmmm. It depends a lot on how much waste heat the missile generates.
Strangely, liquid fuel rockets will do best at this, as all the heat
production goes into the exhaust. Of course that exhaust "backlights"
your nice cold missile. Pity.

My old idea for firing kinetic kill missiles assumed that they were
refrigerated to reduce signature. It also assumed that they were highly
polished cones so that active search beams would reflect off at an
angle, not towards the sender. 

Add an engine on the back with sensors that peek around the edge every
so often, and it might actually managed to intercept a target.

Consider those same players and that same "stealth unit". They need
more power. And it occurs to them that the stealth unit can cool the
hull to 3K, while beaming all the waste heat away at a few thousand K.
The temp difference can be used to create a simple heat engine that
puts out *astonishing* amounts of power. Oops, there\'s that damn
perpetual motion machine.

Or someone realizes that if he beefs it up enough, he can take all that
heat from the laser/particle beam/whatever that the enemy is hitting
him with, and fire it out thru this. Add a grav focuser from an old
laser battery, and he\'s now got an IR beam that\'ll fry the enemy, and
use their *own* power to do it!

And for that matter, thruster plate "world killers" are *still* possible.

Exactly. The spot where the ship emerges had a total of *zero* mass
until the ship emerged. Then it has a few hundred (or thousand) *tons*
of mass. This causes a gravity wave to radiate outward.

Using the standard "rubber sheet" analogy, the spot the ship is going
to emerge at has a very small slope due to the "nearby" star or planet.
When the ship emerges, you have "dropped" a weight on the sheet. The
resulting "dimple" in the sheet radiates outwards at lightspeed.

> Wouldn\'t this have unpleasant side effects on the crew and passengers?

No, because as far as *they* are concerned the *local* curature of
space hasn\'t changed significantly.

Gravity is the "slope" of the rubber sheet. Gravity *waves* are caused
by *moving* mass or changing it significantly. It\'s not gravity waves
holding you to the ground, it\'s gravity. We can\'t generate gravity
waves because we can\'t make enough mass change position fast enough.

The wave will follow the inverse square law. So range matters. I don\'t
know what the *current* sensitivity of gravity wave detectors is. But a
quick way of evaluting signal strength is to figure out how much the
gravitational acceleration at the sensor *changes*. For a ship jumping
in or out, the formula is A=GM/R^2. A is the acceleration, M is the
mass of the ship, and R is the distance to the point it is
appearing/disappearing. 

A ship jumping will result in an acceleration *away* from the jump
point. A ship *arriving* will result in an acceleration *towards* the
jump point.

So you can\'t locate the jump point or determine the mass without at
least *two* sensors a fair distance apart. Each will report an
acceleration vector (strength and direction), and the point where the
vectors cross is where the ship entered or left. If the vectors point
*away* from the intersection, its a ship leaving. If they point towards
it, it\'s a ship arriving. If it\'s one of each, you are pairing the
wrong two vectors. :-)

So you\'ll get the same strength signal from a 100 ton scout at 150 km,
as from a 10,000 ton at 1500 km (100 times the mass at 10 times the
distance).

Democracy is actually well known for being *unfair*. There is no reason
for the majority to be right. Nazi Germany passed that antiJewish
legislation while it was still a democracy. The majority *approvced* of
the laws.

The only saving grace of the republican form of government in the US,
is the somewhat unique idea of the Bill of Rights. That is, a document
that lists things that the government may *not* do, even if a majority
is in favor of them. Alas, the voting public doesn\'t understand that
this is a *safeguard*, and is getting increasingly upset when they vote
to take rights away from a minority and the vote gets thrown out on
constitutional grounds,

But they did a lot of nasty things while still being a democracy! So
have other countries. And the famed democracy of the ancient Greeks was
primarily used to exile people that the rest of the citizens didn\'t
like.

*Current* neutrino detectors are based on inverse beta decay. What

anyway.

Remember, you can get direction even with something as crude as a
geiger tube. You just have to have a couple layers of detectors so that
you can correlate the triggering.

So all you need is *something* that says "a neutrino just went through
me" and that doesn\'t have an excessive "reset" time.

Assuming some way of detecting many neutrinos instead of just a few,
the background won\'t be so bad. sure, you can "hide in the glare" from
a star, but only for people along a line running from the start to
you....

I thank both of the people who have responded with designs. But we are
looking for something considerably smaller and faster. Excerpt from a
message to the author of the other proposal:

- ----

My thought was that these would likely be converted fighters, so we can
probably just wait for the fighter contest to end and strip out the
weapons from a likely design.

But just off the top of my head, you\'d want sonething that can boost a
9-g or better, with a crew of 1-2, and is capable of reaching *at
least* the 100 diameter limit under max boost (ie accelerate half way,
decelerate half way). Extra range is a bonus. 2 crew rather than 1 is a
bonus. Ability to use standard fighter launching and docking facilities
is a bonus. And it should have at least a couple of tones of cargo
space, 10 would be excellent.

Standard equipment load would be paramedic type supplies, oxygen,
water, rescue balls and emergency suits. And an "inflatable" shelter
for say 10-20 (ie a pressure tent they can stuff the casualties in if
the ship won\'t hold air). And gear for cutting into damaged ships (high
tech "jaws of life")

If there *isn\'t* such a shelter in CSC or some other book, there
*ought* to be.

They boost out at max g, then dock with the wreck, and start collecting
casualties and trying to stabilize them. They\'d have a tight beam link
to the hospital back at the station, and be able to send medical data.
Meanwhile, the space ambulance you designed is on the way, as well as
salvage tugs and the local "space cops".

But the *primary* consideration is to be able to get the lifesaving
gear out there as fast as possible. After all, lives are at stake.
- ----

Another excerpt:

- ----

Or even just a pilot/medic if you want an extra-elite group for
Beltwatch. Picture the idiot who tries picking a fight with someone who
spends much of his time either under hi-g during runs, or in simulators
at hi-g *practicing* for runs. :-)

- ----

You *don\'t* pick fights with these guys or with crew for "over comp"
fighters. Not unless you *like* being beaten to a pulp...

I might even buy the Milieu 0/ FS amalgam IF it has the CORE Core 
subsector data. I more or less gave up om IG when I discovered that 
instead of the M0 book having the appropriate UWP\'s it had been decided 
that the FS crap would be inserted instead. That was the only fault with 
the M0 book - which was very good.

Aristotle followed the empirical method in some respects, but did not do so
in many others.  The Aristotlian model of thought has more philosophy in it
than observation, and virtually no concept of continued refining
observation, much less of falsification or prediction from observation.
Aristotle was a great thinker, but he was not a scientist in modern terms.
Pythagoras, Archimedes, or ... nuts, the fellow who figured the earth\'s
circumference from shadows in Egypt... might be, but not Aristotle.

Yes, it could work.  We currently have fine enough control, small enough
lasers with good enough color quality that we can "light up" very small
fields directly on the retina.  There are some adaptive optics problems to
be solved, but having an image projected directly on the retina
(potentially in ridiculous real-world levels of detail) is doable, and is
probably less than 10 or 20 years away.

I\'m hoping the smiley at the end there means you understand that refereed
journals and such do not eliminate personal bias from the scientific corpus
of knowledge.  Kuhn was right about the structure of scientific
revolutions; science is based far more on personality and current social
norms than we care to admit.  I don\'t meant to create controversy here, but
hereare two quick non-crackpot examples: I know of solid neuroanatomical
research that shows hitherto unexpected differences in the brains of men
and women, but it will never be published, as even _submitting_ it for
publication would end the funding and the careers of those involved; and
similarly, there is excellent research on the ability of homosexual men to
change sexual polarity and "become" heterosexual, but given the current
social climate, those involved will _never_ publish their findings for fear
of being excoriated professionally and personally.

We\'ve been using playtesters since the changeover (remember, M0 and FS

 Nowhere did I find info, and noone responded.  Thats because there wasn\'t a 
testing group much to my dismay.

I am so glad to hear that there are now playtesters in the new 
administration.

So Psi Institutes and Pocket Emps is in the works eh?  Need a testor for 
Anomolies?  How about some wierd abnormal ideas of a FNORDy nature?  Stuff 
on planets sure to be interdicted for some reason or another, why?

You\'re not cleared for that information! :)

  That\'s why there are 50 stewards on board - they spend a lot of time
setting the table.  Seriously, one of the scenes from the documentary was
part of the sequence on setting up the dining room - after all the places
were set, one fellow was making sure all the glasses for all the guests
were in line down the entire table (100 ft long or more, it looked like).
Again, thats why there are all those stewards on board - to provide the

stewards do the hard jobs.

  Why am I spending so much time argueing this?  Well, I suppose its the
idea that folks on the top will have a crew made up of player characters
who kill people when the look at them funny.  Don\'t laugh - the stories
I\'ve seen posted to this list make most gaming groups seem like they are
made up of repressed homicidal maniacs, and they play them in games all
the time.  The people who serve on the Imperial Yacht are not those sorts
of people - the typical player character would have a hard time surviving
in the military, let alone be posted to a prestige assignment like the

Hmmm, more accurately thermodynamics is a macroscopic theory, so 
indeed it doesn\'t apply to very few particles.  Statistical mechanics 
can be used to relate the properties of particles (atoms, molecules) 
in bulk, which yields (i) thermodynamics and (ii) some special cases 
for low temperature behaviour to do with quantum effects.

Then of course there is the "negative temperature" of lasers... which 
is actually rather hot.

UK schools teach thermodynamics in 6th form physics (ages 16-18), but 
not many people study physics -- TMLers excepted, before the email 
floods in.  Colleges and universities teach chemical thermodynamics 
in the first undergraduate year (or 2nd year HND).

Energy utilities pressure governments into not educating people in 
thermodynamics, becuase thermodynamically-literate people know how to 
reduce their domestic fuel bills.

I would like to believe this isn\'t true.

Skill levels are integral to Traveller.  I don\'t think that KBv2.0 
changes that.  The experience score was conceived in order to have a 
simple number to add to the character\'s attribute to obtain the 
target number--nothing more than that.  I never intended it to 
replace the skill level.

Think of it this way:

          Target Number = (Skill Level x 3) + Attrubute

I knew I should have posted when I caught that mistake, but I\'ve been 
busy compiling a target number table for KBv2.0 that reports success 
chance but reduces that figure due to the chance of SF.

My numbers were incorrect because I didn\'t do the second step.  I 
figured the chance of rolling 3 sixes on 7D exactly.  I should have 
added the chance of rolling this on the appropriate amount of fewer 
dice as well.

The result was that my figures were off a little--but only 2% at 
the largest difference for Impossible tasks.

When I finish the table, I\'ll post the corrected numbers.

<One good reason for storing straight LH instead of embedding it in

to carry NINE tons of water. There\'s a significant difference. Sure, my

I have to admit, I wasn\'t thinking in terms of fuel for maneuvering, but

What you say I agree with.  The increased mass would require larger maneuver
drives,etc,etc....but I thought only liquid hydrogen could be used as fuel.
Water,
ammonia, or any other hydrogen containing compound, had to be _refined_ before
being used in any of the Traveller starship drive systems.  Correct me if I\'m
wrong.  (Realize to, I\'ve been away from the game for the past few years. What\'s

What I saw with this technology was a reduction in the size of a _purchased_
L-Hyd drop tank system.  Ships designed in my sessions had L-Hyd drop tank
capacity as well as standard onboard fuel tanks.  Some ships had reserve fuel
bladders.  (Realize I used CT/HG starship planning.)  The player crews were
concerned with having enough fuel to <make it home> if there was a mis-
jump accident.  Also, this technique helps with the need for an immediate
<run-away> jump out of system.  I had players that were more than
cautious.  They were usually outgunned 3 to 1.

As far as size of the tanks, why not just double the L-Hyd capacity of the
<standard> drop tank at TL XX and work from there.  Remember, I\'m
only considering drop tanks, which would be available at the appropriate
class starport and at the appropriate TL.  On board tanks, which currently
have, IIRC, minimal mass, would not change.  Unless, someone feels that
there might be a chance to cram more L-Hyd in at higher TLs, thus 
reducing their size.

Food for Thought.

Even though I\'ve been crunching a lot of numbers for KBv2.0, I am

Luckily, numbers don\'t scare me, and when I need help, people from

	Well, I wouldn\'t be so hard on the US\'s system; it does work more
or less <grin> and has been doing so for longer than any other democracy in
the world today.  While IMHO it could do with somewhat tighter campaign
finance laws and elimination of this electoral college oddity, I think that
it still has numerous saving graces.

	And I\'m noticing much the same complaint up here in Qu=E9bec
vis-a-vis discriminatory legislation, not to mention wierd conceptions of
democracy.  Right now, were I to put up an English-only sign, or even a
bilingual sign where English "predominated" over French, in front of my
business, I could get slapped with a fine.  And the current separatist
government was actually mulling measures to give the language police
_warrantless_ search & seizure powers. Apparently these boneheads seem to
think that an English sign is a greater menace to society than Hells Angels
white-slavers with stolen nuclear weapons, but I digress...

	With regard to democracy, these individuals also seem to think that
democracy is defined as "whatever the majority wants", and complains about
recourses to the courts over discriminatory legislation as being
undemocratic.  According to our chief electoral officer, Canadians from
other provinces flying into Montreal for a political rally is a violation
of Qu=E9bec\'s electoral spending law and a graver threat to Qu=E9bec democra=
cy
than the massive, systematic vote fraud carried out by PQ scrutineers
during the last referendum.

	 And then there\'s the fact that federalist groups who violated the
campaign spending laws (which, BTW, violate our Charter of Rights) got
prosecuted, while no separatist groups, some of which outspent their
counterparts by about 8 times, were charged.  And they think that in effect
what amounts to about 10% of the population (of the correct ethnic
minority) voting in favour of separation, while the rest of the country is
denied a say, is democratically speaking enough to justify breaking up the
country.

	I\'ll stop ranting before I start calling this place a "banana
republic without the bananas" as one of my profs (a francophone, BTW) calls
this place.

	In order to tie this in to Traveller somehow, a lot of fun could be
had messing with players\' expectations of a "democratic" society... the
possibilities are practically endless.  There\'s this song by the Clash
called "Know your rights" which are kinda a-propos:

"Know your rights, all three of\'em!...  You have the right not to kill:
murder is a crime!/Unless it was done by a policeman, or an aristocrat...
You have the right to food money, so long as you don\'t mind/ a little
investigation, humiliation, and if you cross your fingers/
rehabilitation!...  You have the right to free speech, so long as you\'re
not dumb enough to actually try it!"

Yes, it is kinda steep. The crash scene during the intro to the "6 million

Carson once: he lived, although he lost a leg in the crash, IIRC.

This turns out not to work, if you do the numbers - you can\'t conserve
momentum and energy simultaneously with thrusters, even if they are magically
connected to a planet. (Energy turns out to be much more of a problem than
momentum - in the solar-system-rest frame, most accelerating thruster craft
are gaining kinetic energy much more rapidly than their power plant is
generating energy. That\'s why thrusters lead to 0.1 c death-lifeboats - 
thruster-powered ships get kinetic energy for free. Some day I should post my
Thruster Perpetual Motion Machine.

Thanks for the compliment.  As for the hull, it is the only item not in

Anybody else managed to get the hullmaker spreadsheet to work?  It sounds

Thruster plates are to my mind the single biggest gaping consistency hull
in Traveller technology.  Jump drive *can* be used to create time machines
and causality violations, but as someone else noted, you have to really
work to pull it off, and it\'s not the sort of thing most players will push
at.

T-plates, on the other hand, violate conservation of energy right out
there in the open, so to speak, leading to all kinds of problems, most
notably the planet-killer lifeboat so beloved of this list.  You can also
do a variety of perpetual-motion-like tricks with them, given how they get
kinetic energy for \'free\'.

However, players and GMs *want* a simple interplanetary transport system,
with low fuel requirements and brief trip times.  T-plates or something
like them are the simplest reasonable solution, sad to say.  I admire TNE
for fighting the good fight and going to reaction drives, but T-plates are
part of the Traveller \'feel\', and will likely be ever with us.  It\'s one
of those areas where GMs will on occasion, with smart players, have to
just say \'no\' to seemingly reasonable ideas.

It *would* be interesting to work out the mechanics of a system where
delta-v cost depended on present speed wrt the nearest massive object,
though.  Maybe I\'ll take a stab at it sometime soon...

By the same logic? Sorry, that\'s not the way it works. I propose a new
feature in the game background to explain some desired effect. If you
can demonstrate that it won\'t work, or that it would create more problems 
than it solves, fine. But you can\'t introduce _new_ features to invalidate
my suggestion. I postulate that a dimension has been found thatcan be
used as a heat sink. The reverse is not true. No dimension has been found
(either because it dosen\'t exist, or, well, because it hasen\'t been found
yet) that will allow anyone to draw energy from it. The question is, how 
will such a heat sink allow the drawing of energy out of thin air?

Yep.  The radiator is going to be very, very hot.  I would not be surprised
by millions of degrees if it has to be completely masked by the hull from
the front.

If there is no radiator, because you are sneaking past someone for a brief
time, your heat sink is going to heat up fast.

I just meant that it was not physically impossible, merely very, very
unlikely.  For example, whatever it is has to be held together with grav
fields, because nothing is going to stay stable at those temperatures.

I had not realized just how much of a problem they were.  I had assumed
that things would work alright if you assumed that they were a near perfect
converter of electrical to kinetic energy.  (Yes, there are some serious
entropy problems.  I have not decided yet how much this bothers me.)  The
acceleration is relative to the nearby solar mass that is pushes against,
and said mass must be large.  I have not yet worked out the numbers to see
if this will be good enough for the hundred diameter range that most
players are working in, as I am willing to say that any given thruster also
has a maximum accel, but that it requires worst case power.

IE, accelerating a 1kg mass from 0 to 1m/s requires a DeltaE of 0.5j, while
going from 200 to 201M/s requires 200.5j.

Unfortunately for our heroes, to go to 100 diameters from earth at 1g takes
about a day and a half (1.6e5 s -> 1.5 days), and leaves the vessel moving
at 1.6e6 m/s.  The energy in the ship is roughly 1.3e12j/kg, and so would
have needed a power input of roughly 8MW/kg over the intervening day and a
half.

This is not good, and I am not sure just how to react.

I had assumed they altered the gravitational potential, causing the ship to
just fall to where it was wanted.

Hmph.  Bob Meson, discoverer of the "skip through the planet and decay at

credit.

Now, how do you _derive_ that? Is it beause it is one-way? Why? We don\'t
know how dimensional rifts would work, so we\'re free to define them any 
way that is consistent. Just because energy flows one way through a
dimensional rift when the temperature is above some threshold, it dosen\'t
follow that it would flow the other way if it was below that threshold.

1) How is this different in principle from using, say, solar panels to draw
   power from the sun? Surely you\'ll never get more power out of the
   contraption than the cosmic 3K background pours into it, will you?

2) Will the amount of power you can draw from the cosmic background
   radiation amount to anything that will significantly outperform
   conventional Traveller power sources?

But it\'s not getting something for nothing, so it\'s not violating any laws

That sounds like a technical problem. The big question is whether assuming
that the problem has been solved would create more problems than it solves.
If not, we have 5-6 tech levels above our own today to play with.

But, Craig, that isn\'t the result of the casually handwaved price of 
technology. It\'s the result of the Ref _overlooking_ that piece of 
technology. The same problem could result from forgetting that the
players has a (perfectly legitimate) message laser or a cargo of
oongoolian fireberries.

And you\'ve overlooked at least three ways of solving the problem:

 (3) Say \'Good idea. Unfortunately it has broken down and will take a long
     time to repair. You\'re not even sure you can do it with the spare
     parts you\'re carrying.\'

 (4) Say \'Good idea. I messed up. I had overlooked that solution. Would
     you like to play Monopoly for the rest of the evening, or what about
     saying that the thing is broken and will take a long time to repair?
     An then play on?\'

 (5) Say \'unfortunately that dingus can\'t be used in atmosphere (new
     handwaving explanation).

Number 5 is, of course, a dangerous solution, and number 3 might anger
some players, who will think you\'re trying to hose them, but I\'ve always
had good results from number 4 (whenever I\'ve messed up, which is not,
thankfully, that often.

Um, no.  The evidence is of a correlation between gay behavior and
certain genes.  It doesn\'t mean that gay behavior can\'t also be
learned (and so means that you can\'t be sure that Norris has the
gene) or that possetion of the gener means you will be gay.

You can only say that there seems to be a higher chance
that she will be gay, and even then you might only be
raising it from a 2% chance to a 5% chance.

Conversions are possible.  Not having EA yet, I can\'t say how, but I don\'t

Untrue actually.  The extra skills don\'t really matter that much (actually
I think T4 Character generation + MT Task system is better than either MT
or (especially) T4 alone.  You can get no more than +8 from skills and
stats on an MT task. Also, I limit folks to a maximum skill of 6.  Skill
levels of 7 or 9 just don\'t seem like Traveller to me.  Anyway, this means
that a character with a stat of 10 (+2) and a skill of 6 (total of +8)
will succeed on a Formidable task 50% of the time (Diff = 15, 7 + 8 = 15). 

In T4, the same character will have an attribute of 16 (or 28 with KB
2.0).  With a 16 in the T4 system the same character will succeed on
Formidable tasks 92 % of the time and on Staggering tasks 73% of the time. 

So in MT, the extreme expert succeeds on Formidable tasks half the time,
while in T4 they succeed at everything up to Impossible tasks 3/4 of the
time.  It looks to me like the MT task system + T4 char gen works much
better than T4 and is not too easy, what problems do you see?

Wrong.

People said horse cavalry was obsolete in 1939 (or even 1914), and they were
right (modulo a few skirmishes where horse cavalry were useful...please
don\'t drag out all the usual minor WW2 cavalry engagements.)

People said the longbow was obsolete in 1700. They were right.

People said the dreadnaught battleship was obsolete in 1941. They were right.

(In all these cases, obsolete doesn\'t mean "totally useless", but "mostly
irrelevant to the main battle".)

Just because experts agree on something, doesn\'t mean they\'re automatically
wrong. (Was it Carl Sagan who said "They laughed at Galileo...But they also
laughed at Bozo The Clown"?)

Almost certainly yes.

The only visible-light sensors pointing at the sky a lot are automated
asteroid-tracking things - and they work at night; just approach from the
direction of the sun.

TL15 stealth should be nearly invisible to most TL12 radars - the USAF 
satellite-tracking radars are designed to look for 30-cm metal objects in LEO;
they\'d never see a stealthed (few-cm-equivalent-crosssection) object in
a higher orbit, let alone when it was approaching earth.

As everyone keeps saying, the main way to detect a starship is in the IR.
All the military IR detectors are pointing down, not up, looking for ICBM
launches, so they\'d never see a starship - particularly if (again) it
approached from the sun. The only way it would get detected is if a
scientific IR telescope (ISO, MSX) happened to be pointed in the right
direction (and, once again, they don\'t point very close to the sun.)

In a few years the LIGO gravity-wave detector might pick it up leaving
jumpspace...

I can build a machine that would be just as "perpetual" given a solar
panel. That could theoretially last as long as the sun burns. That\'s not
what is meant by a perpetual engine. You\'re not _creating_ energy.
 
>I also have to wonder about what the effect of removing that much

That much energy? Enough to cool off a paltry couple of trillion ships for
a few years each throughout the forseeable lifespan of Charted Space?
Surely that wouldn\'t even be noticable on the scale of the whole universe.

Is that inevetable or would you say that there could be scale restraints 
that would allow a ship to use it and still not let anyone use it as a 
superweapo?

So it\'s less of a superweapon than the Darrian Stellar Trigger?

But you can\'t create any energy, can you? You have to produce the energy
in the first place. If so, why not just define the power requirements of
this heat sink device to roughly balance out to whatever "free" energy
the difference would provide you with.

existence of decoy ships (q-ships) in an article they did in JTAS or
_Challenge_.  These are ships that resemble normal merchant ships, until
they meet with pirates.  Then -- *surprise!!!* -- they open up with all
guns and blow Mr. Pirate away.  

In TNE, the Warship column of the Ship Table can result in a character
receiving a "modified" free/far/fat trader/liner (more guns).  Wouldn\'t it
be more appropriate to let the characters get a q-ship, one that\'s
*designed* with better maneuver drives, instead of a trader with just some
extra weapons?   I know *I\'d* prefer for my character to receive such a
ship.  :-)

I designed one that looks like the typical far trader.  It has jump-2, so
it can keep up with a merchant convoy, a sheepdog in sheep\'s clothing,
waiting for some poor, unsuspecting pirate to wander into its gunsights...

I\'ve been meaning to do the finishing touches (how many hits/Hits the
components take, the hit location chart, etc.), but I never did find the
time, so I\'m posting the FFS-style writeup now.  

Feedback would be appreciated.

Notes

1.  This ship is externally identical to the classic (type-A2) far trader.  
2.  Fuel scoops capable of ingesting 1,120 kiloliters (80 tons) 
  per hour.  
3.  FPP (1.2 MW) capable of refining 240 kiloliters every 6 hours.  
  (40 kl/hr; 10.5 hours for 420 kiloliters; another 25 hours for
  1,000 kiloliters)
4.  Power plant has a shortfall of 33.069 MW when the laser turrets are
  powered to the x10 level.  This shortfall can be made up by powering
  down the CG lifters and the EMS jammer, or by powering the laser turrets
  only to the x5 level (for -1 Diff Mod).  
5.  Notice that this ship has two PEMS arrays: one fixed, one folding.  
  This improves the tactical options for the ship commander.  
  (The practice of installing two PEMS arrays, one being the largest fixed 
  array available, the other being a folding array with a longer detection 
  range, is standard for ships designed by O\'Neill Shipwrights.)  

Standard ship names include Phantom, Spectre, Ghost, Shade, Haunt, Spook,
and Caspar.

investment a High jump ship represents should be rewarded when using it as 
designed.

I may be being blatantly obvious but I feel that the rules are not clear on 
this point.

I propose that the income generated by one jump is related to the distance 
traveled in that Jump.  This means that to travel the same distance on any 
vessel always costs the same.

A jump 1 ship traveling between two planets that are j3 apart requires 3 
jump 1\'s and would cost a traveler Cr30,000.  If this same trip is made on 
a Jump 3 vessel then only one jump is required and the cost is still 
Cr30,000.  The same ships both traveling to a planet 1 hex away would 
charge Cr10,000.  All this would mean is that the extra capital required to 
build a J3 ship is rewarded when the ship is used as designed.

It also means that ships are designed for specific roles (as we would hope 
for) and that the proud owners of a J3 ship would be crazy (or players) to 
pop around doing J1 all the time.

It also gives those more expensive high jump ships a chance to pay 
themselves off because the earning capacity is higher per year (while ships 
repayments are also higher, of course).

These distance related charges would also apply to freight and all forms of 
passage but not to speculative cargo.

All coments welcome and apologies in advance if my microsoft mailer stuffs 
anyones stuff up.
The plan is that it won\'t and I am testing this before I send it.

I didn\'t know if she was an empress of the Imperium or something else.

If there is no canonical answer, I was going to suggest she is the main 
charater in a line of children\'s stories which were popular in 1000 when the
ship was first built. Like the Wizard of Oz series.  

I have come up with a version of the ship with Jump-4 engines, which was built
by Sol-Sec as a spy/courier ship inside of the Imperium.  It is called
the Princess Allianah class.

Welllll, not really.  Sure, Einsteinian physics didn\'t eat Newtonian
physics, but quantum mech did disassemble parts of the Einsteinian view.
Oxygen ate phlogiston; cognition ate behaviorism which ate hydraulic
Freudianism; plate tectonics subdued catastrophism... the list goes on.

Science as a method and a body of knowledge is great, but it\'s not nearly
so clean and pure as we would often like to believe.

I have to go along with Pablo on this one. When the Digest group brought
out the task system in early Digests I thought it was great. When it became
the MT system I thought WOW even better. It is simple to remember and easy
to use (much easier of course than the CT mess). However when TNE appeared
I bought it I love the background, but the task system sucks. I realise
this was done so that GDW had a unified system to support, but MT tasks are
still usable with that system.
T$ however has one of the worst task systems I\'ve seen in RPGs. It is
possible to use MT with the system & background but overall it seems a
mess. Why fix something that didn\'t appear to be broken.

I\'m about to start a new Traveller campaign with a new group of people and
I\'m going to use the MT system. Just coz T$ is new doesn\'t mean it\'s what
everyone wants or works.

The strangest thing about T$ to me is the change from the old 1.5m deck
plans to 2m. Was this to satisfy the 25mm players, is 15mm dead? There is a
large selection of 15mm plans out there are people willing to throw all
that away

I\'m a little unclear here as to your train of thought.  Are you saying

continuing to dodge the subject with situations that change the

This makes more sense.  Why have a listing for...

1. Skill Name
2. Attribute Level
3. Skill Level
4. Experience Level (#3 multiplied by three)
5. Target Number (#2 + #4)

...when you can do away with #3 all together.  #3 is only necessary
for character generation, converting NPC skill levels in published
adventures, and determining character competence with regards to a

=46or the few times you need a "Skill Level", the above step is
sufficient.  Considering the infrequency that you need to know this,
however, it only serves to complicate things or muddle up the
character sheet by adding another column.

Huh?

I think Dave was referring to "how do you depict such a map using a 2D
surface such as a piece of paper"?

As it currently stands, normal space appears two dimensional so that
you can take your little ruler and make quick, easy measurements
between systems.  If riding aboard a Jump-1 trader, you can simply
count the number of hexes to your destination to determine how long it
will take.

By converting the Traveller universe to 3D, the various star systems
will no longer be located exactly x parsecs apart in normal space.
You will end up with distances on a 2D map that are something other
than a multiple of "parsecs".  The hex map will have to be thrown out
the window.

What results then is a final product that looks completely different
than the original 2D map.  Linking sectors and subsectors together
when they are published, making sure that all the original jump-1
trade routes would link up properly, would make this a cartographer\'s
nightmare.

Sure it does.  It may not be the "official" way of determining

Ok, how about this.  Ships require jump fields to keep the physics and
environment of jumpspace (defined as a dimension) away from the ship
and its crew.  Collapse this field and the ship precipitates violently
out into normal space at a molecular level over a path of several
billion kilometres.  Since this field is necessary according to canon,
you cannot produce a hole in which to dump heat from our universe
without breaching this "barrier" (such as the jump field) which is
designed to prevent the dangerous interactions between two dimensions.

The reverse is not true *ONLY* because you did not include it in your
original post.  I only included it to expand the thinking regarding
transporting energy from one dimension to another.  It is not
"untrue".

And no dimension has been found that allows you to do what you are
trying to do.

I think Leonard already covered an example for this.

*I* have the problem regarding the definition of "thin air".  In my
opinion, you shouldn\'t be able to move matter from one dimension to
another.  Traveller does not do this either.  A ship in jump is
isolated from the other dimension and does not interact with it (canon
states that ships in jumpspace that lose their jump drives simply
materialize violently back into normal space in itty bitty pieces).

It\'s funny, when I first bought CT in the late 70\'s (mighta been
early 80 :-/ I never in a million years would\'ve described the
drives used as reactionless.  The lack of a clear statement of that
meant that I called them "fusion torches."

HEPlaR was a goofy attempt to make a nearby-spectator friendly
version, which I never liked much.  Besides which, HEPlaR has to
fuse the fuel to have the KE of the exhaust balance with the PE of
the fuel (which was actually described as something closer to
propellant).

Interesting idea.  I prefer nasty, dirty fusion rockets :-)

They make sensor stuff much easier to game as well (if the drive is
on, you\'re spotted :-)

I had assumed the same.  But, if the uncertainty in position is an inherent
property of jump space, such a coordination might not be possible.
Furthermore, it might make large scale attacks on a defended world quite
different than is presented in the popular literature.  If it makes such an
attack impossible, then it would not be a candidate for a Rules Variant.

What does the list say?  Can an attack be carried out against a defended
world without the benefit of jumping into the system as a fleet at the same
time?  If so, could such an attack occur with standard Traveller ship types?

This is stretching things a bit beyond what Marc intended, I think, but as it
has no effect on the game,  individual referees can do what they think makes
their campaign more interesting.

Marc always used to say that Traveller players were free to choose their
character\'s gender and gender preference. I think we got one letter in 15
years asking about the position of gays in Imperial society...maybe two.

	So was I. Whether you\'re using thruster plates or fusion rockets, you
still have to push around the mass of jump fuel, jump fuel tanks, jump fuel
processing equipment (you gotta get the hydrogen outta the H20, and then do
SOMETHING with the O), etc. Again, it\'s not volumetric efficiency that
really matters, it\'s mass efficiency.

You are changing definitions, either out of malice or ignorance.  We do
not bestow the title of "science" on just any description of the universe,
otherwise we would have to class myths ("Zeus throws thunderbolts when
he\'s angry") among proper scientific literature.  Science is a _method_
as much as a corpus of knowledge.
 
> He followed the Empirical method, so his a scientist.

He did _not_ follow the empirical method, as others have already pointed
out.  Have you ever read Aristotle?  His ideas on such topics as the
motion of flung objects (he believed they moved along straight lines up
and outwards until their initial "impetus" ran out, upon which they fell
straight down), rates of fall of objects of different masses (larger ones
fall faster, he claimed), biological features of assorted animals, could
all have been _tested_, the foundation of modern science -- but they
weren\'t.  Aristotle was not a scientist in the precise, modern definition
of the word.  Among historians, perhaps.  Among scientists (or historians
of science), no.

I am, alas, not familiar enough with the history of science to explain the
history of the phlogiston theory.  Anyone else?  I do have a good friend
working on a doctorate in the history of science at Princeton if I have to
go infoquesting.  As for the whole Ptolemaic -> Copernican shift, much of
that was produced by ever-improving instruments.  Ptolemy\'s system was
"science" in that it tried to fit the universe to the data, rather than
vice versa, but again it was enshrined before the modern scientific
process of opposition, independent testing, and fact-checking.  Sure
enough, when modern science started to get underway, it rapidly fell under
the assault of independent checking and theorizing.

You don\'t seem to understand: people thought differently back then.  ("The
past is a different country.  They do things differently there.")  The
scientific method of thought, really, is only a few centuries old.

So you claim that, suddenly, because of some scientist\'s "Eureka!" in a
lab, we will all be slung off the Earth at high velocity because gravity
no longer exists?  You have a very strange conception of the universe.
Just how much scientific education have you had?  (Does it match your
grammatical education?)  Again... we may find new results in unfamiliar
situations (near the speed of light, etc. -- though we\'re already
researching that regime fairly thoroughly!), but familiar, everday,
observable effects in already-explored situations _will_continue_to_exist.
To get weird effects, you will have to create weird situations.

Are you a biologist?  A geneticist?  Could you provide me with references
for this assertion?  Certainly life in general could evolve using
different constructs than the double helix, but we are darned certain that
_our_ brand of life, here on Earth, uses the double helix model.  I\'ve
worked in hospitals and research laboratories, and there are going to be
some _very_ surprised scientists out there if somehow our DNA is not built
that way.  Don\'t you think such a major element would have been already
hashed out by now?

	I guess my take on this whole argument is that while the EXPLANATIONS
change, the ability to predict gets better. Thus, Newtonian physics could
predict how things behave in certain areas; Einsteinian could predict
better, and could go outside those areas. But in the areas where Newtonian
physics made good predictions, THEY WERE STILL GOOD after Einstein came
along! Just because we had a better understanding of WHY things behaved a
certain way didn\'t change HOW they behaved. Sure, maybe at the 12th decimal
place, there\'s a difference between how Newton would predict the path of my
golf ball, and how Einstein would. The ball still hit my boss, regardless.
That\'s why I don\'t play golf ...

	So if you come up with a new "physics" for Traveller, you\'d better make
sure it generates the same results in the settings we already know. That
golf ball better still hit the colonel.

	Not quite. I mean how do you decide the mapping between 2D and 3D space.
It is not mathematically possible for each point in realspace to correspond
to one and only one point in jumpspace. Yes, they\'re both infinite, but
they\'re different levels of infinity, and NOT equal.

It was a blast working on it. I particularly enjoyed the fact that even I

"cannonball through the window" physics.

I\'m just sorry my "City in the Middle of Africa founded by A Lost Roman

adventure. Or the series of adventures based on thwarting the schemes of the
Inscrutable, Insidious and Unscupulous Oriental Mastermindt (tm applied for).

Sometime, I must tell you of my Space: 1889 character, Edmund Blackadder, aka

Are you thinking of Eratosthenes (c.275-c.195 BC) who devised a world map 
and a system of chronology and measured the earth\'s circumference and 
tilt and the size and distance from earth of the sun and moon?

or perhaps Aristarchus of Samos (c.310-c.230 BC) who made crude estimates 
of the size of the sun and moon and advocated a Heliocentric universe 18 
centuries before Copernicus?

Sometimes I wonder what other amazing discoveries were made in the 
ancient world. I wish the library of Alexandria didn\'t burn...

My character sheets have a listing for UPP--just like everyone

Pistol-1                          3              Dex (10)



This give me the skill and level, the experience score, a place to 
put xp points for that skill, the base characteristic for that skill, 
and the target number for that skill given the character is not 
wounded.

All of this at a glance.  I don\'t know what you people are talking 
about--complicated?

I will try not to be offended by your remark, and call you nasty =

I do know a little about thermodynamics, as I took a third year =

When I said the 3 Laws of Thermo where true in all known =

I had assumed the same.  But, if the uncertainty in position is an inherent

Furthermore, it might make large scale attacks on a defended world quite

What does the list say?  Can an attack be carried out against a defended

I think a lot of Science Fiction (and Traveller in particular) 
allegorizes the modern world.

viz:

USA/Russia               Imperium/Zhodani
Collapse of USSR         Rebellion Era
GenX angst               Virus Era
Worship of Technology
& Cultural Imperialism   Borg

and (to be even more controversial)

Utopian Communism/Rampant Capitalism    Federation/Ferrengi

In truth, as you say, much sci-fi puts more thought into technology and 
the impact on technology on society. I guess the focus of traveller 
hasn\'t been so much the *technology* as the *socio-political background*.

Look at the LBB\'s. They didn\'t have rules for how to shoot at a vehicle, 
space battles and combat was *very* abstracted. What was important was 
the cultures of the Imperium, the politics of feudalism, and the 
economics of space travel.

It wasn\'t until the second and third editions that details of gadgetry 
got more attention.

The thing is, Traveller carries a lot of baggage. The Traveller 
background is based on science fiction in the same vein as Asimov\'s 
Foundation, and other pre-infoage science fiction. It\'s difficult to 
reconcile that vision of the future with the prevailing one.

But we *know* from experience, both visions of the future will be wrong!

So I say, keep the Imperium and the Traveller universe as is. No-one\'s 
stopping anyone from using Traveller rules to model a more "modern" 
vision of what future society will be like.

Traveller isn\'t 90s tech + flash, it\'s 70s tech + 90s tweaks + flash. And 
I kinda like it that way!

No Way. Aristotle was a philosopher. He most certainly did *not* follow 
the empirical method.

The scientific method wasn\'t prevelant until the 17th century. British 
empiricism was founded by John Locke in the _Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding_ in 1690.

The Oxygen Theory of Combustion. See rant below.

It also wasn\'t science. It was theology. That person couldn\'t believe 
that the Earth *wasn\'t* the centre of the universe, so came up with a 
complicated model to account for the motions of the sun and planets that 
kept the Earth at the centre. 

You seem to see science in terms of black and white. It is either "right" 
or it turns out to be "wrong". It is impossible to model reality exacty. 
It is impossible to prove a model of reality to be "right".

What is possible, is to develop a model of reality, through mathematical 
formulae, which predicts reasonably well how reality works.

The phlogiston theory was a hypothesis regarding combustion which Johann 
Becher postulated that a colourless, odorless, weightless substance is 
present in all flammable material. When the material burns, the ash is 
the true material and the phlogiston is given off into the air. Lavoisier 
proposed the oxygen theory of combustion which became the new rule.

Just because there was a new rule and the phlogiston theory fell out of 
favour didn\'t mean that things stopped burning, and ash stopped being 
formed after flammable materials burned. The new theory happened to model 
the reality of combustion better, and explained oxygen\'s role in 
respiration to boot.

Too much faith into science for little reason? I will try not to read to 
much into that. I think I have reason to have faith in science, as right 
now I remain seated in my chair and I am not spinning off the earth into 
space.

I think people put too much faith in *technology*, but so far, science is 
doing a pretty good job of explaining most macroscopic (human sized) 
phenomena. The problem has been explaining things at the extremes of 
size, in the microscopic and cosmic scales.

So to nudge this topic more into Traveller, I appreciate it when very few 
basic scientific "truths" are violated to account for Traveller 
technology, and when they are (eg. Jump drives, anti-grav) I appreciate 
some thought put into a self-consistant pseudo-scientific model of how 
and why the technology does what it does.

I noticed additional attack forms in the TNE main book, and, noting 
that they are easily converted to T4, I am listing them below.

Next game session, I plan to make these attack forms availble for my 
players.

I just did a quick conversion to T4 basing my decisions on the rules 
in the TNE book.  You may want to change some of the conversion 
choices that I\'ve made below.  



1)  Block:
This is different from the Pure Defense choice above in that 
a character may combine a block with an offensive attack 
routine using the multiple action rule.

Whenever a character is successfully attacked by some form of melee 
attack, he may choose an attempt at blocking it.  If the attack is an 
armed attack, then the defender must use a weapon of some sort to 
block with.  (You cannot use your arm to block a sword blow.)

The task to attempt a block is:  Formidable test of Brawling

Success means that the attack is blocked, but the block action still 
counts against a character\'s End pool (if you use the optional 
pools).  Spectacular Success means that the block does not count 
against the character\'s End pool.  If the block is against an armed 
melee weapon, then use the appropriate skill of the weapon being used 
to block.  The Brawling skill may be used if an improvised weapon is 
used.



2)  Leaping Kick:
A leaping kick is an attempt to put more force behind a kick by 
throwing oneself feet-first at the enemy.  When figuring the End 
pool, this attack routine costs two points.

The task to attempt a leaping kick is:  Difficult test of Dexterity

Success means that the attacker has hit the enemy and has managed to 
land on his feet.  The target attacked takes double normal 
strike damage (1 D6 x 2).

Failure means that both the target and the attacker are knocked down. 
Damage equal to 1 D6 is inflicted on both of them.

A character who is not surprised may try to avoid a leaping kick.  If 
the attack is avoided, the attacker either lands on his feet or 
crashes to the ground based on his original attack throw.  The 
avoidance roll is considered an attack, unless SS is rolled, with 
regard to the End pool.

The task to avoid a leaping kick is:  Difficult test of Dexterity



3)  Kick:
The kick attack form is separated from the strike attack form on pg. 
55 of T4.  It\'s harder to do but also delivers more damage.  This 
attack routine counts as two points against a character\'s End pool.  
Damage from a kick is 1.5D.

The task to attempt a kick is:  Difficult test of Brawling.



4)  Strangle:
A strangle is handled like a grapple (see rules pg. 55, T4), with a 
few exceptions.  (A) The strangle attempt may be blocked by an 
Average test of Dexterity.  (B) The strangle attempt causes 1 point 
of damage to the victim each combat round which is applied solely to 
the victim\'s End score.  When the victim\'s End score reaches 0, he is 
either unconscious or dead at the attacker\'s discretion (Strangled 
characters will usually fall unconscious before they die--the 
attacker can, at that point, decide whether to kill the victim or 
not.  Alternatively, the GM can devise a check--a suggest roll 
against the victim\'s End--to see if the character is dead.)  (C) Use 
of a garotte will double the damage inflicted by a strangle attack to 
2 points per combat round.

If the initial block of the strangle is unsuccessful, the only way to 
save a character is if he is successful breaking away from the 
strangle attempt.  This is handled the same as breaking away from a 
grapple attempt--which is covered under grappling in the T4 rules.



5)  Throws:
A throw is a defensive move and can only be attempted by a character 
who is successfully attacked by an unarmed strike attack, a kick, a 
grapple, or a strangle.  

The character must first make a block task roll for the specific 
attack form against him.  This block sets up the throw and must be 
successful before the throw can be attempted.  If the block is not 
successful, the attack on the character is carried out normally, and 
the throw may not be attempted.

If the block is successful, the throw can be attempted, and this 
attempt cannot be avoided by the object of the throw.

The task to attempt a throw is:  Formidable test of Brawling

Success means that the oppenent is thrown to the ground and suffers 
1 D6 damage.  Failure means that the throw is unsuccessful, but the 
block remains successful.  

Since grapples cannot be blocked, a character must first break free 
before attempting the throw.  The block/throw combination attempt is 
considered one action, and when this is attempted, successful or not, 
one point in the character\'s End pool is used up.

Victims of a throw can attempt to limit the damage from the throw by 
rolling a task to controll their landing.

The task to control landing is:  Difficult test of Dexterity

If successful, damage from the throw is halved.  If, on the other 
hand, the task to attempt the throw was a spectacular success, no 
roll to control landing is allowed.  The control landing roll is not 
considered an action against the victim\'s End pool.



6)  Diving Blows:
A diving blow is an attempt to throw oneself at the enemy and knock 
him off his feet.  Blocking is not possible, but avoidance is.  
Unlike other melee attack forms, the diving blow always succeeds 
unless the target is successful with his avoidance roll.  A diving 
blow counts as two points against a character\'s End Pool.

If a character is surprised, the diving blow always hits without 
error.  If the object of the diving blow is not surprised, he may 
make a roll to avoid.

The task to attempt avoidance is:  Average test of Dexterity

If the blow is avoided, the attacker falls to the ground, having 
missed the target.  If the attack is not avoided, the diving blow 
automatically hits.

When a diving blow hits, compare two scores to see who is knocked 
down.  If 1 D6 + (2 x End) of the attacker is greater than Str + End 
of the defender, the defender is knocked down and suffers damage 
equal to the difference between the two values.  Otherwise, the 
attacker is knocked down and suffers damage equal to the difference 
between the two values.  Defenders who are surprised use only their 
End for comparison.



This is a pretty straight forward conversion from TNE to T4.  I\'ve 
made some changes because of the hit point/damage systems in the two 
games are on different scales.  

If you have any comments, hit me with them.

Kenneth.

That\'s Empress Marava. Yes she was the 14th "Emperor of the Flag" of the 
Imperium.

Chepe, in what terms are you expressing v?  Meters per second?

P : Engine power in (in MW? KW? what?)

t : seconds of constant thrust

m : Ship\'s mass in Kg

Ken, we\'re saying the same thing.

I just don\'t see a need for maintaining a seperate column for the 1\'s and
2\'s between skill levels.  Personally, I\'m not going to use skill levels at
all after character generation anyway.

> Am I missing something?

Maybe that we\'re saying the same thing.  I keep the skill level in my
example (take another look at it), for compatability with all those folks
that can\'t bare to part with them.  ;-> Personally, it\'s the number of
skill points that are important, and I\'ll refer to someone as having a
Pilot-10 or Medic-7, where the number refers directly to the skill points.

Right, so even if you can access parallel universes they don\'t help you

Just an idea...could we store anti-H2 molecules in a bucky-ball cage?  The
repulsion should keep the AM centered inside the carbon shell until it\'s
broken by heat or shock.  Depending on what level of sensitivity we come up
with, this could be a fairly safe method of storing and transporting
AM..."Pump 10 gallons of AM-BB\'s into my tank, I\'ve got a run to Mars
tomorrow." ;->

That *was* my point.  The skill levels can be determined if somebody feels
a need to see them.  I think Ken is more tied to the old system than he\'s
willing to admit. ;-> 

Personally, I\'m going to use my aptitude system...not the one Ken dedicated

This has only come up a few times in games I\'ve run, but here\'s the method
I\'ve used.

1.  All ships must be using Refined Fuel.

2.  All ships must have the same course and vector leading up to the jump.

3.  All ships must be making a jump equal to or less than their maximum
rated jump.

4.  All ships begin the jump-injection on a single signal.

5.  One Astrogator does the lock on and transmits the data to the other
ships, and they all jump together with as little variance in timing as
possible.

If all these conditions are met, then the ships emerge at the other end
within 7-2d6 minutes of ETA.  The "Time in Jump" (TIJ)..or ETA..is still
160+2d6 hours.  Ships emerge in the same formation as when they jumped. 
Entire fleets *can\'t* coordinate well enough to do this, but small
squadrons and divisions can.

bzzzt wrong. Im not a scientist, not by a long shot, but i am a student of
science and its social definitions, workings and impact.  For all intenst
and purposes Aristotle was a scientists, perhaps not by what we are a
familiar with, but he was nontheless the forefather of people like
Galileo, Newton and Eienstein.  

Your statement can be compared to saying something like "primitive man
isnt human"  no, thats wrong there human, they may not be Homo Sapien (or
whatever the term for modern man is), they may not look like men, they
may not act like men but there still men.

Actually Aristotle wasnt a modern scientists, and yes i have read
Aristotle.  Your being whats termed, "whiggish".  Your looking at
Aristotle through modern paradigms, which is wrong.  In his time he was
effectively, what we would term, a scientist.  As were some of his
contemporaries.

I do understand, more than you can imagine.  Your quibbling over a modern
definition of a scientist, which you havent defined yet, so i will
a Scienctist, is nne versed in or devoted to science.

So whats Science?, Science is the systematic study of man and his
environment, based on the deductions and inferences which can be made ,
and the general laws which can be formulated from reproducable
observatiosn and measurements of events within teh universe.

So, where does aristotle fail?  Just because he didnt use an electronic
microscope and didnt wear a white jacket?  He was limited to is own
primitive instruments and his own physical limitations but he formulated
theories on what he observed in the universe.  His a scientist in my
books, and his also considered a scientist but most scientific historians 
ive read.

You just cant read.  Where did i say what you just stated?

You also seem to hold the Anarchists method of discovery (Eureka) in
contempt.  This sort of discovery does happen though, and it has happened
in history - people just think of things, no extensive research no

Hee! Hee! While I have *no* love for TSR, I can\'t say I have a great deal
of respect for WOTC either.  <sigh>  Industry shakeout and contraction
isn\'t always a bad thing, but when the best known..and supposedly best
financed company in the industry gets bought out by a second line
player..that\'s not a good thing.

I agree with you. Yeah, I\'m the guy that suggested the Skill Level column,
but that was to placate the old die hards that *have* to have a skill
level. <g>  

Truth be told, I\'m not even going to have traditional Skill Levels *during*
character generation. Each time a PC get\'s a specific skill the player will
figure the addition to the Skill Point total and just put that on the
character sheet. Of course, my system is a little more involved, but I\'m
not ready to talk about that right now.

   Sex and sexual orientation has always been a tricky topic in RPGs. 
Gotta watch out for those roving gangs of fundamentalists afterall. 
Still, *if* Norris were gay (and that was my conclusion) it makes him a
far more interesting character.  A short of Richard the Lionhearted
figure in space.

I am not suggesting that highly skilled characters don\'t know what they are
doing. On the contrary, my suggestion will benefit highly skilled
characters.

Perhaps I did not explain it well. Consider the following two characters; a
skilled character A with attribute 8 and skill 3, and a superb character B
with attribute F and skill 6. A\'s target number is 17 and B\'s is 33. The
only way A and B can fail a 3-dice Average task is to roll 18; a special
failure. So A and B perform identically on average tasks. Both characters
also have exactly the same probablility of getting a spectacular failure on
all tasks. I don\'t like this; I think that B with a target number of 33
should perform better than A with a target number of 17. I think that B is
good enough to minimize what would be a catastrophe for an ordinary person.

My suggestion is: when you roll 3 or more sixes to first compare the total
against the target number. If the total is less than or equal to the target
number, the task is a normal failure and not a spectacular failure. The
task is a spectacular failure only if the roll is both 3 or more sixes AND
above the target number. Think of it this way; a task roll of 3 or more
sixes is automatic failure. If you roll automatic failure and above your
target number as well you get spectacular failure.

Look at how that affects the earlier example; on a roll of 18 with 3 dice,
A fails spectacularly but B fails only normally. In fact, B cannot
spectacularly fail an Average, Difficult, or even a Formidable roll. B can
spectacularly fail a Staggering task, but the chance of spectacular failure
is less than A\'s because B has to roll at least 5 sixes.

KBv2.0 already gives highly skilled characters a better chance to roll
spectacular success. I agree with this. What I am suggesting is to also
give then a lesser chance to roll spectacular failure.

That\'s because the CT rules never really nailed down what maneuver drives
were; the only clues were nozzle-looking things at the aft end of (some) 
deckplans.  In my way-back-when CT campaign, I waffled...at first, I said
they were fusion rockets, then decided that I wanted to be able to land
ships without starting firestorms, and moved to reactionless thrusters.

And that\'s the other big reason for moving to thrusters.  HEPlaR is just
about at (or even a bit over) the theoretical maximum ISp you can derive
from fusion; even so, Travelleresque ships only get 60ish G-hours of
thrust out of HEPlaR.  This rather seriously breaks the canon/traditional
feel of space combat and in-system travel.  To get any higher performance,
you need a more energetic process (matter-antimatter annihilation, for
example, would buy about 15 times the performance per unit mass of fuel),
or a hand-wave reactionless drive.  As I and others have discussed, the
latter runs afoul of conservation laws.

Oops... Misunderstanding... What I meant was that theoretically you
should be able to do a one-to-one mapping of 3D to 2D space, but don\'t
look to me for the answer to that question.

They might still be x parsecs away in normal space (if you want to), but
as you said they won\'t be confined to hexes in the 2D map anymore.

My own degree (BS, appropriately enough) is in applied chemistry, during
the course of acquiring which I took Physical Chemistry, Thermodynamics,
and Industrial Chemistry.  Some of it has even survived the subsequent 12
years of near-total neglect. :)

I still remember my delight when I truly understood that a refridgerator
*really is* a heat engine running backward. :)

The trick to the laws of thermodynamics is to understand that they are
*statistical* in nature, that is, based on probabilities, stabilized by
the Law of Large Numbers.  For systems of less than a few million
particles, they become less and less aplicable, as individual variancnes
in behavior among the particles begin to rise above the \'noise\' level of
mass-average behavior.  Also, being statistical, the laws *can*, *very
theoretically*, fail on the macro scale.  There is no physical law
*preventing* that teak kettle full of water from freezing solid when you
put it on the stove.  However, and my p-chem prof actually *derived this*
for us (!), if the entire mass of the known universe were composed of
teapots on stoves, endlesly boiling, throughout the entire bang/crunch
cyle of 50 billion years, and there were a trillion other tea-kettle
universes doing the same, there\'d be a 50/50 chance of *one* kettle
freezing on the stove.  Now *that* is what I call a memorable lecture.

So the laws of thermo aren\'t quite as \'strong\' as the laws of (say) motion
- -- but to all intents and purposes, for macroscopic systems, they are damn
close.

It\'s not that it is *complicated*.  Only that it can be made *less

Why go to the hassle of recalculating (read: erase and rewrite) the

by 3?  What is so important about Skill Level that it deserves its own

This is a real problem.  Not only is it hard to understand why it would
work out this way, but it is inconsitent with the economics described
for the Imperium.  I also means that if you are shiping something
a long distance (more than one jump) it is impossible to know how
much it would cost (since if it goes by a bunch of short jumps
is will cost more than a few longer jumps).

I heard about the takeover on the TBP mailing list the day it happened
and a few individuals were sorry to see TRS go under.  One posting was
based something like this (I\'m paraphrasing here):

"TSR introduced many of us to the hobby of roleplaying.  Like it or
not, 9 out of 10 of us heard about RPGs by exposure to TSR\'s D&D line
of games.  The fantasy genre was easy to sell, the "hard science" of
Traveller was not.  If TSR didn\'t exist back then, there is no telling
what the RPG hobby would look like right now.  D&D sales made up a
great deal of the profits for many game stores, and without TSR, many
would not exist today.  TSR\'s drive to be the best in the industry
helped bring other companies like GDW, ICE, Chaosium, White Wolf,
HERO, etc. into the market.  Although Traveller never really competed
directly with the fantasy world of Greyhawk, many of us might never
had discovered Traveller if we hadn\'t made the trip to our local game
store to see what all the fuss was about (regarding D&D).

"Likewise, this is a major wake-up call to all other RPG companies.
If it can happen to a giant like TSR, it can happen to anyone-- in a
heartbeat!"

Just to set the record straight, I do not play D&D.  I don\'t like the
rule mechanics and I don\'t like "science".

#3 works, but doesn\'t answer the players\' question.  They will be
under the impression that they *could* do what they want to do when
they get the contraption running again.

#5 also works, but now the campaign begins to suffer under an
increasing number of handwaved answers.

I agree, #4 is probably the best choice out of all five.  It is even
better when your players take an interest in maintaining the order of
your game universe.  If the entire group takes a timeout and tries to
work on the problem together, the whole game will benefit from their
attempt (instead of sending everybody home and leaving the referee to
try and figure things out by him/herself).

The actual chance that someone is gay is closer to 3-4 % and there
chance of being bisexual is also about 3-4%.  

As a quick way of determining an NPC\'s sexual orientation when it
matters (if a PC makes a pass at them for instance) roll 2d6: On a roll
of 2 the charecter is gay, on a 12 they are bi, on any other roll they
are straight.

Some of the recent (and nigh definitive) studies of sexual orientation
have looked at the sexual orientations of identical twins.  I\'ve seen
articles on 4 or 5 of them done in the last few years, by both American
& British researchers, and covering both gay men and lesbians which
indicated that if one twin is gay the other has about a 50% chance of
being gay as well.  Some of these twins were reared apart and they still
had a higher chance of being gay (40% + IIRC). A clone is essentially
the same as an identical twin so the data should be similar (twins
may/will have more maternal mitochondrial DNA in common than a clone
raised in a different womb would but thats a minor point).

In addition we need to remember that different genes have different
rates of _expressivity_ and that the fact that some straight identified
people have the "gay gene" while some gay identified people do not may
reflect the expressivity of the gene & not merely its presence or
absence (expressivity is basically the chance that the gene will
activate).

This is a lot better chance than you suggest & what little canonical
evidence we have about Seldrian suggests that she was also
gay.

=46YI, "science" is defined as: knowledge of general facts, laws, and
relationships that is obtained through systematic observation and
experiment, especially as applied to the physical world and the
phenomena associated with it.

"Scientific method" is likewise described as: the principles and

Wrong.  We cannot define Aristotle effectively as a "scientist" since
the very definition was defined long after he was alive.

It\'s A LOT more than that-- you have to define "science" (see above).

Correct.  But science further demands that we continue to test, poke,
and prod, until there is NO DOUBT left in the "theory".  Only then is
it considered "fact".  Aristotle did not have this thoroughness.

I hated the mustering out rules regarding ships in TNE.  It was just
too easy for a large group of people to own a multi-million credit
starship.  TNE goes one step further and automatically assumes that
all PCs have known each other for quite a while (why else would they
compile their "Ship DMs"?).  Yuck!

Q-ships where operated by the Allied governments during WWII to
counter enemy submarine attacks.  There would be little purpose of a
group of independent PCs to possess such a ship-- other than for
piracy.

Giving any character a q-ship raises the question "How do I pay for
it?"  Q-ships sacrifice cargo space for weapons and drives, space
necessary to pay for a ship that isn\'t fully paid for yet.  As you are
probably well aware of, nearly all trader designs have problems making
their monthly payments-- even under ideal circumstances.  A reduced
cargo capacity would spell doom.

All is not lost, however.  Perhaps a special branch of the Navy could
*lone* Q-ships to retired characters, much like the Scouts lone out
ships.  The Q-ship would probably function much like a subsidized
merchant, plying a specific route for a fixed period each year and
exchanging a sizable profit share for its monthly payments.  It could
still make part of its payments through trading, although most of its
payments would be paid by the company whose trade routes you are
protecting.  For those few weeks that you are "on vacation", you are
expected to defend other shipping (whom your bosses will contact
regarding payment for any services rendered during that time).

  Best Roleplaying Game Ever, in my view - as demonstrated by the eight
issues of the fanzine "Transactions of the Royal Martian Geographical
Society" I wrote and edited.  Aside from the combat system (I never met
anyone who actually used it as written), it was clean, easy to use, and a
blast to play.  Too bad it was not as popular as other games, a
circumstance I blame on the lack of "really cool guns" - if the weapons
list had just gone into more detail, like Call of Cthulhu, lets say, I
think more power gamers would have liked it.

  Great minds think alike (sort of).  No lie, I actually ran a game that
combined all three of these ideas (sick, huh?).  The evil mastermind
trapped the players in the Hollow Earth (Hollow Mars, actually), where
they found all sorts of exotic races that someone (they guessed the
Vulcans) had collected over the years.  Including, of course, lizardmen,
moonmen, and the obligatory Lost Roman Legion.  The players eventually
triumphed, freeing the enslaved Cartheginians, though all but one of them
were trapped inside Mars forever.  They didn\'t mind, though - they found
True Love, or in the case of the inventor character, a really neat
collection of ancient artifacts to study.

  The adventure had its genesis in the observation that Martian gravity
was too high - in Space 1889 it\'s given as 90% of Earth\'s, though it
should be more like 40% (can\'t remember the correct figure offhand).  I
decided this was because there were gravity generators buried below the
planet, and that it was hollow inside - a really big spaceship, if you
will.  Now was it built by Martians, Vulcans, or somebody else?  I never
really decided - I just needed a place for the Roman Legion. 

  The one fellow to escape, the army sergeant, fell off a cliff into a
raging river, never to be seen again.  Well, not until the climax of the
Transactions campaign, when Baron Towster and his trusty manservant
had their final showdown with Colonel O\'Reily, the Fenian mastermind.
Since this was the climax of a three-year campaign, I brought back all of
those characters who had been there at the begining (at least the ones who
were still alive).  The sergeant had been one of those characters, and
since the Hollow Mars adventure had not been fully official, I decided to
bring him back.  The other players found him in a Martian cave, where he
had been washed up by the river from underground.  He had survived by
eating mushrooms for months - needless to say the other characters never
believed his wild stories about his experiences underground.  I don\'t
think the player ever forgave me for the mushrooms - turned out he hated
them in real life.

  Yeh, why is it that most of the games I like (aside from Traveller) turn
out to be commercially unsuccesful?  I found Magic: the Gathering to be
boring, and loved Space 1889 and 2300:AD.  Guess which game sold milions?
Good thing I never tried to run a game store.

In the sense that he tried to explain the universe?  Then so are shamans
and priests.  You are trying to define "scientists" by function rather
than method, which is valid in a sociological sort of way, I suppose,
but hardly in a practical one.

But a scientist, or a Christian, or a libertarian, is determined by what
she or he _does_: very different from, say, an Australopithecine, or a
Caucasian, who is classified as such because of what he _is_.  It\'s the
old choice vs. heritage, nature vs. nurture quibble again.  I say
scientists are defined by what (and how) they do; you, apparently, claim
that it is only their function as Explainers of the Universe that makes
them important.  If I misunderstand, please clarify.

I don\'t understand the term "whiggish," though I can guess at it.  If
being a nit-picker about proper spelling, grammar, and logic makes me
one, so be it.  :-)

But let\'s not get into cultural relativism here -- sure, again, in purely
anthropological terms we can view Aristotle as a "scientist" of sorts...
but what possible relevance does that have to this debate, which began by
discussing whether science could sustain the sort of radical changes you
would have it suffer for the sake of handwaved Traveller technology?  I
note, for example, that you still haven\'t responded to my "tree-sap"
disagreement with you from earlier.

"Man" has nothing to do with science, except as you render it an
anthropological conceit totally divorced from objective reality, which is
what far too many off-the-wall feminists and whatnot keep trying to do
nowadays.  (Viz. the recent assault on Newton\'s Principia as a "rape
manual.")

But I\'ll grant you much of the definition -- in which case, note that
you\'ve just hoist yourself by your own petard.  Aristotle did not perform
his "science" via "reproducable observations and measurements," otherwise
he wouldn\'t have stuck us with his bone-headed ideas about the physics of
motion.  Therefore, even according to your own definition, he was not a
scientist.  Can we get off this tangent now?

See the top of the quoted section, re: "gravity being disregarded... in
the future."  That seems pretty obvious to me.  If it wasn\'t what you
meant, perhaps you might consider writing more clearly?

Sure.  Kekule\'s discovery of the benzene ring, or Einstein\'s gedanken
experiments, are obvious examples.  But such discoveries usually come on
top of sufficient experimental work to justify them.  Kekule was an
experienced chemist whose subconscious was able to plow through the
amassed difficulties and help him out with a dream.  Einstein existed in a
world and a time where problems in physics had presented themselves which
he was able to solve purely theoretically -- but, note, based on already-
existing knowledge.

I apologize for the unwarranted attack.  I have found your scientific
assertions, and the spelling and grammar in which they are presented,
frustrating in the extreme.  Every time I or others present coherent
objections to your arguments, you rush to change the subject to yet
another ill-formed argument, thus floating further and further from the
point (what does Aristotle have to do with Traveller?)

Discussion lists like TML or others I am on often put me in mind of
civilized cocktail parties where people strive to present themselves and
their positions in the best light possible.  When someone wades in
swinging a post filled with ill-wrought sentences, bad grammar, and
ill-thought-out arguments, it feels rather like a slurring rag-clothed bum
rushing the Gentleman\'s Club.  (I exempt non-native speakers, of which we
have many on this forum -- but, last I checked, electric-rain.net was
hosted in a nominally English-speaking country, yet your posts are less
well-composed than theirs). 

If you kill-file me, so be it.  I know from private email that I do not
speak alone in disliking your posting style, argument tactics, and
apparent conception of the scientific method, but I regret that my own
over-emotional response to it has made me impolite.  Again, I apologize
for the over-heated and personal style to which I descended.

    'topic' => 'IISS Fast Rescue Boat',
    'body' => '  As part of the prep for my Beltwatch game, I decided to see just how
fast a design I could come up with to get help out there when needed.
Here\'s a first pass:

Rescue Boat
TL: 12
Size: 10 Ton Std (Steamlined Cylinder)
Acceleration: 11.1 G (empty), 10 G (9 metric tons cargo)
Armor: 3 all around
Power: 24 Mw (Fusion +), 100 hours fuel
Crew: 2 (grav comp, 10 G)
Cargo Space: 7.1 Ton Std
Com: Continental range, 0.1 Mw
Sensor: Continental range radar, 0.1 Mw
Standard Life Support, 1750m<3>


  The rescue boat is designed to take rescue personel to emergencies as
quickly as possible.  Stacked grav compensators allow compensation to 10
G, the crew must remain in their spacious 2m<3> couches while under
acceleration.  The life support system is oversized so that it can hook up
to a damaged ship and support it, or an inflatable airtight temporary
shelter similar to the Survival Tent (from Central Supply Catalog) can be
inflated and attached.  The additional cargo space can carry more fuel or
rescue equipment - due to no G compensation in this area, no passengers
are carried.  The design includes a roomy 3m<3> airlock with
decontamination capability.

  Rescue equipment normally carried includes:

2x	EVA-11 Suits, Anti-Infiltration, Anti-Corrosive, Heat-absorbing
	  Extenal sensors, Psi-Shielded
100x	Survival Bubbles
2x	Entry Cutter
2x	Iris Valve Opener
2x	Atmosphere tester
4x	Medical Scanner
10x	Paramedic Kit-11
1x	Portable airlock
1x	Survey Shield
1x	Large Survival tent (1500Kg)
100x	Wall Patches
2x	Mechanical Tool Kit
2x	Electronics Tool Kit


Design notes:  As other folks have said, it is a pain in the behind to
design small craft for high acceleration, since you have to itterate
between mass and volume.  The Fighter design competition will be tough - I
probably will pass, given what a pain in the behind this was.

  You could get slightly better performance (12G) with a 5T hull, but that
would leave only 28 cubic meters for gear - this design gives more
flexibility in cargo carrying, I think. 

  Since this is my first effort with the small craft design system, 
perhaps someone could eyeball the design and see if it is reasonable.
Comments are welcome.

Umm, Q-ships actually operated against enemy surface raiders ... but, yes, there is 
little reason for a group of PCs to own one except piracy (and Germany used Q-ships for 
commerce raiding eg the Kormoran).

Why ? Wouldnt it be simpler just to have the regular Navy staff the ship ? This way 
there is less risk of the crew deciding to join the wolves, rather than guard against 
them.

And as for arming a merchant ship, why not get a reasonably-well armed merchant ship 
with a bit of spare power, and put a crack naval crew and dirty great big naval battle 
computer in it ... being a High Guard holdout, I think you should be able to cram a Mod 
7 computer into, say, a 1000t freighter, as long as you avoided any energy-using 
weapons, and the nuclear warheads in the missiles (we *are* the Navy, after all) will 
shock the average pirate immensely ...

Don\'t forget that modern watches have more functionality too. 

I got my first watch about 30 years ago. And it was a wonderful thing.
I still have it somewhere, it just needs some cleaning. But the
important fact was that this watch displayed the day of the month *and*
the day of the week in little windows. And it was a windup type watch. 

Setting it the first time took me half an hour. It took a minute or two

I thought it was ok. But in my opinion, it was the last thing he wrote
that was *readable*. 

For Traveller ideas, try tracking down "Babel-17", and "The Ballad of
Beta-2". They are more likely to be useful, though I can\'t promise that
you\'ll find anything that you want to indtroduce into your campaign.

Scary idea of the decade... introduce the Zhodani to someone who speaks
Babel-17.

If you do that, then then you can\'t use it to cool the ship either.

But what\'s the limit of v as t approaches infinity. Near as I can tell,
it\'s infinity.

Assume a 100 ton ship (1e5 kg) with a 1 GW (1e9) power plant.

v=sqrt(2*1e9*t/1e5)
v=sqrt(2e4*t)
v=100*sqrt(2t)

Yep, it doesn\'t have a limit.

let\'s see how long to 1% c.

3e6=100*sqrt(2t)
3e4=sqrt(2t)
9e8=2t
4.5e8=t

A bit over 14 years. I\'d say that\'s "safe"

But I bet transit times are a bitch.


Will your rusty calculus let you do a similar calculation for the "true
reactionless" drive. It violates conservation of momentum, but obeys
"Work equals force times distance". 

And while you are at it, a formula for distance versus time to go with
your current one for velocity would be nice.

No, it *works*, it just doesn\'t allow constant acceleration. Your

fast.

Well, that\'s because you *assumed* that they could violate conservation
of energy. If you limit the KE increase to the power plant\'s output,
then you conserve both momentum and energy.

Better yet, dig up a copy of Marc Steigler\'s short story "The Gentle
Seduction". It\'s one of the few attempts to describe events leading up
to the Singularity (actually, it may describe some things *afterwards*,
but only vaguely).

You take a "pill" (bunch of nanobots) that *grows* a subcutaneous
headband. Only people that\'ll notice will be other folks with
headbands, and then only if they enhance their vision a bit.

There was a wonderful story I read. It\'d be *perfect* as a Traveller
hi-law level society. Every community is allowed it\'s own laws,
strictly enforced. Everyone carries a pocket AI for legal advice. And
at any boundary where the law changes, there are transmitters (wireless
LAN type setup) so your AI can download the rules *before* you enter.

Think of the fun of hitting the players with that. 

"But I checked with the AI, it said drinking was legal!"

"Yes, but that was in the *city*, you should have had it set to warn
 you when you crossed the boundary into the county...."

"Where\'s that?"

"It\'s the street you crossed just before I arrested you...."

I just saw a special on near future medicine. One item was an artifical
hand that works that way. Even has some (limited) feedback. The guy
wearing it pointed out that he can actually do things that folks with
real hands can\'t. *His* wrist can rotate continously in either

Halloween.

Visual output requires either a light source or direct nerve interfacing.

BTW, there are a couple of odd devices that a reliable source reports
can be used to feed you an audio signal via a contact *anywhere* on
your body. Best guess is that the induced signal in the nerves has some
characteristic that makes the brain shunt to signal to the audio centers.

Back when Heinlein\'s "Number of the Beast" came out, the Tandy Model
100 laptop was fairly new. the M100SIG on Compuserve got together and
came up with a couple of what we\'d now call "shell" programs that
incorporated a crude "personality simulator". I\'ve got source (in
*BASIC*) to the best of the lot somewhere. I plan on updating it
eventually and putting it on a PC. It\'s actually no brighter than
Eliza. Except that part of the responses are running programs for you. :-)

	"Deety, where\'s my mail?"
	"Ha! Who\'d write to you... probably all spam."
	<and then your email program comes up>

Add multiple choices for responses, randomly selected, and you get the
*appearance* of intelligence.

You are arguing a point he didn\'t make. For example, battleships turn
out to be a nice way to deliver heavy bombarment to small countries
with seacoasts. And the armor is even a plus. So is the fact that
they\'ve fitted cruise missile launchers on them...

Easy. A writer has the following choices if he *understands* the rate
of progress involved.

1. stick to *very* near future.
2. handwave that progress slows down
3. Try to figure out how to describe post-Singularity society (by the
   very *definition* of the Singularity we can\'t even *imagine* what it\'ll
   be like afterwards)

Remember, just *before* the Singularity, people will be able to do
*anything* we can currently imagine that is physically *possible*.  And
there\'s every indication that unless *something* intervenes, we\'ll be
there before 2100.

So Traveller doesn\'t really have a choice, do they?

There\'s one *big* advantage to jacks. Namely, it\'s *much* easier to
control just who is running what. While passwords and secure comm
protocols are good, nothing beats *physical* security.

Consider the "fun" with a headband that controls things if you let your
mind wander or don\'t realize that you are in pickup range of the gizmo.
If you have to jack in, that means you *can\'t* control it until you are
jacked in, and you can unjack if something goes wrong (like bad ICE
heading for you).

This is why wireless keyboards didn\'t catch on. In fact, IBM had to
*retrofit* the PCjr with a wired keyboard because of what happened to
them in classrooms. One of the bigger goofs Big Blue ever made.

Which is why the first few to survive will soon be training new pilots

But yes, they\'re nuts by our standards. But ever take a look at the
kind of *junk* people were flying up until WWII? 

I suspect that a low TL spacefaring culture, properly handled, should
both scare the pants off our heroes, and make them respect it.

How\'d you like to jump into a system and discover that it was WWII,
only with the Germans, Japanese *and* the US using nukes, and aerospace
fighters and bombers...

Or the cold war in space. Or...

Here\'s a filk song about one possible outcome.... Be warned! It\'s a downer.

            Space is Dark (words & music: Bill Roper)

Chorus:
    Space is dark and space is deep,
    And the price we\'ve paid is far too steep.
    Though we\'ve gained a hero\'s name,
    We\'re all cripples just the same,
    And the scars we bear will testify
    To the pain we\'ve found beyond the sky.

We set out in our starship in twenty-forty-nine,
Sent to ply the galaxy, another earth to find.
They put us in our coffins and gently closed the lid.
And if I\'d known then what I know now, I\'d\'ve wished we\'d wake up dead.

And so we flew a thousand years through interstellar space.
Light years seperated us from the human race.
Then at last we slowed as we approached our target star,
And now we\'d find the reason that we\'d travelled so far.
CHORUS
As we awoke from frozen sleep, we each knew what to do.
We\'d scan the sky about the star for a planet shining blue.
We\'d pull into an orbit, and check her atmosphere,
And run a half a hundred tests to see if she proved fair.

We\'d monitor the radio so that we could see
If there were any aliens who\'d come here before we.
Then from our receiver a tiny voice we heard,
And it spoke to us in English and we understood each word.
CHORUS
Ten years we had been on our way when they found the hyperdrive,
And man spread to a thousand stars while we were half alive.
But still they could not stop our ship to save us from our fate.
And so we have arrived here but nine hundred years too late.

They told us we were heroes, pinned medals on our chests,
And they gave us a fine pension and sent us off to rest.
For we\'re anachronisms from another place and time,
And so they have retired us though we\'re all still in our prime.
CHORUS
And of the ten men in our crew, but two of us remain,
For trapped here in the future, we all have gone insane.
We knew when we set out that we\'d be gone a thousand years,
But we never thought we\'d end up as unwanted pensioneers.

First you take a chunk of negative mass matter (negamatter). Since it
has negative mass, pushing on it makes it move closer, pulling on it
makes it move away. This is *not* antimatter.

If you place it near an equal mass of normal matter, they\'ll sit there,
until the slightest motion along the line running thru them occurs. At
which point, they take off across the universe, constantly
accelerating! 

It works like this. The normal matter exerts a gravitational force upon
the negative matterand vice versa: GMm/r^2. Since the signs of M and m
are *different, the result is *negative, so instead of being the useual
*attractive* force, you get a repulsion. That makes the normal matter
move away from the negative matter. But because the negative matter has
negative mass, negative times negative equals positive. So it moves
*towards* the normal matter! And thus they wind up chasing each other
at ever increasing velocities.

Note that this *doesn\'t* violate any conservation laws, because due to
the negative mass, the kinetic energy and momentum of the negamatter is
equal and opposite to that of the normal matter. Thus the "system" has
total momentum and KE of *zero*.

By charging the negamatter and use of electric and magnetic fields you
can control this movement. 

So you just stick this inside a ship and scoot off at as much
acceleration as you can stand. It\'s a *bit* trickier to deal with when
stuck inside a ship this way, but the principle is the same.

Just don\'t try to *touch* the negamatter. Negamatter plus normal matter
results in *nothing*. As in they cancel each other out. No muss, no
fuss, just *gone*. (Of course making actual contact is difficult. :-)

Negamatter is also useful for things like stabilizing wormholes. And if
you can create it, you can create it and normal matter in equal amounts
out of empty space. Which may be "free energy".

Without negamatter you can still do *weird* things if you have the
ability to create and manipulate matter at neutron star densities. But
that\'s for a different post.

Nope. NASA doesn\'t work that way. While some improvements were made in
the airframe, everything else was *frozen* arounf 1970-73. And was
designed with *older* technology, because of the *required* safety
factors. They wanted stuff that had a track record.

The gear on the Shuttles *has* to be the same. That\'s because they do a
*complete* teardown after every flight and *rebuild*, replacing parts
that aren\'t perfect. This means that quite often parts from a Shuttle
that has just been torn down will wind up in a Shuttle that\'s just had
a part rejected. That way they don\'t have to wait for the spare to be
*made* (they can\'t afford a spare parts inventory on their budget). In
fact, I\'ve heard that it\'s almost *common, to have only three sets of a
fair number of parts, and not unheard of to get down to *two* sets. 

It\'s a miracle the Shuttles fly at all given the thing Congress has
done to the project over the years.

As for Apple computers and the Shuttle, A modified Apple II was part of
an experiment on a flight in the 80s. It was certified as safe to fly
(as in it wouldn\'t cause problems for the Shuttle). The TRS-80 Model
100 laptop was also certified *as is* for use on the Shuttle. This is
an old 8-bit CPU machine. I own a couple. :-)

Space rated CPUs and other computer parts tend to be *old* technology.
For one thing, modern sub-micron chip layouts *guarantee* a flunk on
the radiation immunity tests. It\'s too easy for a passing cosmic ray to
flip the state of a bit in a register or memory location.

Remember, all the chip manufacturers use radiation detectors to screen
the raw materials for the IC housing that goes around the chip. This
was after someone had to throw away an entire run of RAM chips vbecause
the ceramic was a little more radioactive than normal (*everything* is
somewhat radioactive!). Being so close to the chip, the tiny bit of
extra radioactivity was enough to cause frequent memory errors.

A few Amateur Radio satellites failed badly by trying to use 16-bit
CPUs and architecture. I\'ve heard of a few attempts to "shield" things
by essentially burying them in lead!

If you do *that*, without having them push on something, then you lose
conservation of momentum. Ok, we\'ll grant that. You also get a
*different* problem than the "pushes on the sun" case. 

The acceleration is a force. And the force makes the ship move.
Therefore, we have the standard equation W=fd (work equals force times
distance). Work is just another name for Energy. But this says that
your energy consumption depends on the *distance* you move. It also
makes high velocities *terribly* expensive!

100 diameters is 100*8000 km = 8e5 km = 8e8 m.
   D=.5AT^2
 8e8=.5*10*T^2
16e8=10*T^2
16e7=T^2
T=12649 sec = 211 minutes = 3.5 hr. 

And the end velocity is 126,491 m/s. Call it 1.3e5. We get 8e9 j/kg
for 8 GW/kg.

Now consider the "true reactionless" drive I mention above. For 1 g,
the force is 10 newtons per kg. Over a distance of 8e8 meters that
gives a total energy budget of 8e9 Gj per kg for the trip. But it needs
1.3e6 per kg during the last second!

> This is not good, and I am not sure just how to react.

My reaction is that I need to try to get my writing ability improved to
the point where I can publish a story using "real" reactionless drives.
Probably with the stereotypical "backyard inmventor" who doesn\'t listen
to the experts. So he builds them. And then finds out how *badly* they
work.

Gravitational *potential* is the amount of energy it takes to escape
from the field. It depends on *mass* and how far away it is. It\'s equal
to escape velocity.

Gravitational *force* is different. You can get get the same *force* at
wildly differing potentials. The gravity at Saturn\'s cloudtops is about
1 g. But the gravitational *potential* is huge. 

So:
	Potential    = sqrt(2GM/r)    (actually escape velocity)
	Acceleration = GM/r^2

Sorry, but science consists of three things.

1. make observations or experiment
2. come up with an explanation for the observations or experimental results.
3. either experiment (if possible/practical) or make more observations.
   Either way, you test your explanation to see if it fits further
   observation/experiments. In short, look for things that can
   *disprove* your explanation.

Aristotle *sometimes* made observations. He often relied on hearsay
rather than observing for himself. And he *never* experimented. Also,
he *never* looked for anything that might *disprove* his theories.
Heck, he proposed them in the first place because they fit his
philosphy.

Phlogiston was part of the transition from alchemy to Chemistry.
Proving that it was *wrong* is what *made* chemistry a science. Until
then it wasn\'t. They didn\'t do quantitative observations.

You have to realize that not all science *became* sciences at the same
time. Physics was first. Or maybe Astronomy (Kepler\'s laws). Chemistry
was next. Then maybe biology. You\'ll find that there is some debate as
to whether pyshology and sociology are "really" sciences even now. They
can\'t predict worth a damn, so that tends to say that they aren\'t. 

"The measure of the rigor of a science is its ability to predict"

If it can\'t make reliable predictions, it isn\'t science.

But that doesn\'t change what happens under "normal" conditions. So
therefore gravity can\'t be disregarded. Anything you discover to the
contrary will be under circumstances we have yet to encounter. But the
old rules will still apply under the circumstances we *have*
encountered, and the new rules will "be" (simplify to) the old rules
under the old conditions.

Maybe the fact that if you understood their arguments, you\'d find that
they are *based* on the very things you want to say are "wrong".

Most don\'t know what it *is*. They think it\'s akin to magic. <sigh>

BTW, the conservation laws are among the very *last* things that are
likely to be found wrong. You see, it turns out that they are just a
different way of stating that certain properties of the universe don\'t
change.

Conservation of mass turns out to be the same as saying that natural
laws don\'t depend on *location* in the universe.

Conservation of energy turns out to say the same thing, except with
regards to *time*.

And there are similar things for conservation of momentum, charge, etc.
My books are in storage, or I\'d post the others.

So we *can* violate conservation of energy in our game universe. But
that means that the laws of nature in that universe should change over
time. Not a situation *I* want to deal with. Though I *have* used it to
explain to a techy player why things change in a *fantasy* game. :-)

Depends, do they still have litters, or did the ancients curb their fertility
and extend their lifespan?
If they still have litters, then they probably still have specific times of
fertility. This allows a female with a litter time to care for the young
until the children can be on  their own, without being bothered by the males.
If the life span has been extended to match a human span, they may still have
"heats", but they will be less frequent. An extended life span would also
mean that a litter would be smaller, possibly being only a single birth.
Wether or not a Vagar female would have sex outside of her fertile period is
her own business....

This summarises as: science involves producing models which describe 
the behaviour of the real world.  The test of scientific accuracy is 
how well the predictions of a model compare to systematic and 
repeated experiment or inferences from it.

As has been pointed out, while Aristotle produced theories concerning 
the physical world, he appears to have taken very little notice of 
whether they predicted physical behaviour accurately or not.  Their 
physical accuracy was secondary to their philosophical "truth".  This 
has more in common with Xeno\'s paradox than modern science.  The 
philosophical underpinnings of modern science may be Aristotle\'s -- 
he wanted a consistent framework for everything -- but the important 
element of adapting the model is absent.

It is not wiggish (or even whiggish) to dismiss Aristoltle as a 
*modern* scientist when we are discussing modern or super-modern 
science.

The distinction people are failing to make is between observation and 
interpretation.  Observation: things burn.  Models: (i) the fire god 
is at work, (ii) phlogiston, (iii) oxygen combustion, (iv) reactive 
collision between O2 molecules and the material, resulting in a whole 
host of secondary reactions in which HO...CO complexes are important.
The models/interpretations develop additional degrees of complexity 
to incorporate other scientifically-determined facts, like the 
existence of oxygen, for instance.  Each is consistent with an 
ever-broader series of observations and the models which explain 
them.

The point is that if we know a thing happens in the real world, then 
*under the same circumstances* in a SF world, it will happen the same 
way.

He\'s probably averse to misspelled, badly typed arguments.  It really 
does prejudice people against the content of the argument... it\'s 
particularly visible on TML since AFAIK all the other regular 
contributors write very accurately.  (Special praise for those with 
mainland European email addresses -- I find your English is always
extremely good.)

As for arguing about DNA being a double-helix (or thereabouts, and 
yes I\'m aware of research into base-pair substitutions etc.), this is 
not a convenient model.  Watson and Crick perfomed X-ray 
crystallographic measurements on DNA, which gave the relative 
positions of all the atoms.  (It\'s inaccurate for hydrogen, but 
that\'s not relevant.)  The geometry of the atomic arrangements was 
loosely that of a double helix.  In some circumstances DNA may lose 
this structure briefly (to replicate?).  In general, it\'s a double 
helix.

This rant brought to you by a scientist who doesn\'t do experiments, 
but still compares his work to experimental data.

I think you\'re right, but there would be a risk that the shot that did the
damage produced some strange acceleration from atmosphere outgassing, etc.
Now that\'d make life really exciting. And you couldn\'t accelerate until the
storage fields were back on-line, so you\'d be toast.

Actually the \'democracy\' of Classical Athens was really just an
exceptionally open Oligarchy. No votes for women, certainly none for slaves.
Citizenship required that all your grandparents were citizens.

I suspect that the first country that was anywhere near being a true was
France after the revolution. If you disallow it on the basis of no women
voters (which means that somewhat under 50% of the population gets to vote),
then New Zealand is the first (but it\'s not a republic - yet).

That\'s basically what I had in mind, but bear in mind that with quality
atomic clocks (or use a quasar) even a big fleet could jump in sync.

The reason I required all the ships to calculate the jump and cross
reference was to get the \'slow calculation\' accuracy in minimal time,
through paralellel processing.

Here is an example of one such mapping.  Take a 2-D plane, with
coordinates X and Y.  Let x and y be decimal digits of X and Y (we\'re
working in base ten here).  Form the irrational number:

I = 0.xyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxy...

made by interchanging digits from X and Y.  Remember, X and Y can be
irrational, so they go on forever.  However, I is irrational too, so
it goes on forever as well.

Now, move to 3D space.  Let X, Y and Z be coordinates in a solid.
x, y and z are digits of the above, as before.  Now read I as:

I = 0.xyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyz...

This gives you values of X, Y and Z.  Thus, we have a unique mapping
between every 2D point and every 3D point.  It\'s certainly not
a mapping that you\'d want to use for Traveller hyperspace, but it
demonstrates the point.

Subject: Ship damage in Emperor\'s Arsenal

Several of the large TL 13-15 Plasma Cannons list a ship damage figure
(i.e. 11-0-0-0).  Anyone know what the conversion is between dice of
damage to PC\'s and ship damage?

Specifically, I\'d like to know how a small ship\'s laser will affect a guy in
Augmented Battledress.
 ----

<QUOTE OFF>

I think the answer lies in our "Rosetta Stone", that being in the form of 
the SSDS USD conversion chart.  The Dammage from a small civy laser is a USD 
of 1, using the chart the laser has a dammage rate of 20 or more, I would 
say that the ship laser would cut trough the B-Dress and vape the poor 
person within.

This would comply with the \'common sense\' rule.  If the thing can knock out 
weapons, sensors, and punch holes in the fuel tanks, it should be able to 
vape a Jarhead in full Aug. BD.

So the EA has TL13-15 Plasma Cannons eh?  Here i was trying to make one with 
old FF&S for a ship spinal mount at TL-12.  I have GOT to get this book! :)

The sensitivity of them is pretty weak and under debate as to wether they
work at all. The problem with building good ones is to have them at rest,
keep them cool and don\'t subject them to vibrations: (put them in zero G
far from a planets gravity ie orbit around sun far out to keep equilibrium
temp low and keep them uncrewed with little or no moving parts. They\'re
designed to detect cosmic gravity waves that occur when big stuff fall into
black holes, neutron stars ie large masses accelerating a lot and
incredible ranges. I feel pretty shure that if todays devices work at all
they\'d easily detect an incoming or outgoing starship(jumping). One problem
is that they\'re directional (one magnetically suspended cylinder coated
with piezoelectric size measurer I think) but one can envision spherical
ones with far less sensitivity but omnidirectional.

One cool adventure possibility is that in order to render such a device
useless simply go there with your ship, out the airlock and give the thing
a good kick with your spaceboots. The vibrations would either permanently
damage the thing or render it useless a couple of days.

I don\'t really want to jump into a flame war, but I just can\'t stand it.

Look, by your own definition "Science... can be formulated from reproducable
observations and measurements...". Aristotle fails in that HE DIDN\'T MAKE
MEASUREMENTS OR OBSERVATIONS! He conducted a lot of thought experiments.
He said stuff like "Men are superior to women because they have more teeth".
He never counted a single tooth though!!! He just figured that\'s the reason
that men were superior. This is, at best, philosophy. 

Anyways, Arisotole is not a scientist, or at least, he is not a "studier of
science" by your own definition. 

Now, true, at the time, he was as close as you could get to a modern scientist,
in that he attempted to formulate reasons for how the world worked, but he 
did not use anything close to the scientific method. A lot of Greeks
of that period were "pretty close" to being scientists, but often got
science and philosophy (and geometry) confused. (eg. "men are better
than women because they can trisect angles" ;) )

A lot of those Greeks made decent engineers though... drinking, womanizing
(er, manizing ?), slapping up a few bridges and getting their science all
wrong.

A good read.  Criton\'s "The Great Train Robbery" is a better source for the
slang of the period.  Particularly the criminal slang.

The difference Engine was interesting in how it showed technology \'steaming
ahead\' in some areas, but lagging behind in others.  The medical sciences
were on target for the period for example.

Well, I was trying to discuss classic Traveller thruster plates...

The problem with the variation you (and others) suggested, in which 
acceleration goes down as velocity increases (to maintain
mv dv/dt = P) is that it only conserves energy in one reference frame.
Transform to a different frame - for example, one at rest initially with 
respect to the (moving) starship before it begins accelerating again - and
you\'re no longer conserving energy. I suppose you could just toss away
frame invariance and have a privledged frame that thruster plates conserve
energy with respect to...although I have a lingering feeling that that doesn\'t
work either.

        Yes... it\'s just that is not very comfortable to make the

everytime IG releases a new product I like. Anyway, if somebody makes up

        I just haven\'t stopped to make extensive comparisons. I see your
point, and you are right. Moreover, I am happy because you are right. I will
be even more happy if I were able to see the overall picture... some tables
of compared probabilities. Somebody has made an extensive study? If the MT
task system is really good for T4 characters, somebody should tell IG !

Notes: The ship has 20 small staterooms and 5 large staterooms to
accommodate the ship\'s crew and two additional passengers.  While at full
acceleration, 4Gs, the ship\'s crew can operate a full efficiency as long as
they are strapped into their work stations.  However, in order for damage
control operations to take place the ship can only use a maximum of 3Gs of
acceleration.  The ship\'s 4 laser batteries with five lasers each can easily
be configured to operate as 2 batteries with 10 lasers each and would have a
rating of (+4) 1/9-9-5-3.  There is only enough fuel for the power plant to
run at full power for 3 months.
 
The Erlir Class Patrol Cruiser is built by the Ansha Starship Cooperative on
Ansha.  Ansha has long been in a state of cold war with the nearby world of
Gadirur.  When the Imperial expansion came Ansha quickly become a member of
the Imperium.  Ansha benefited from its membership in the Imperium by
gaining allied against Gadirur while the Imperium gained a means of keeping
Gadirur, which had been hostile to Imperium advances, in check.  The Erlir
Class Patrol Cruiser is the first ship to be built by the Ansha Starship
Cooperative that is fully compatible with Imperial Naval Service standards. 
Despite full comparability with INS standards, the Erlir class is distinctly
different from typical Imperial vessels in appearance.  Like all ship built
on Ansha the Erlir has a very organic shape.  Even more striking than the
shape are the wild color schemes that are exhibited on Ansha ships.  The
abstract color schemes are painted on the ships by artist priests, who while
having to follow certain guidelines still maintain much freedom in how a
ship ends up looking.

Design notes:  The Erlir is pretty much a typical Patrol Cruiser.  The
design favors features over cost.  The design was done with the assistance
of Craig Barry\'s QSDS spread sheet and includes a hull from Guy Garrnett\'s
Big Hull List and EMM from SSDS.  If the ship acceleration was base on its
mass it would only have an acceleration of 2Gs and personally this is the
way I would go.  The length for the ship was roughly calculated from
drawings of the ship.  And a thanks to Dr. Mark Clark for posting his design
to the TML.  After seeing his design I decided to spilt the 2 batteries of
10 lasers into 4 batteries of 5.

Please feel free to come and take look at the Erlir online at:
(http://users.aol.com/ogerdude/patcru.htm)
Be warned though, this page is under sever construction (damn taxes and
work) but will feature a picture of what the ship looks like.  No deckplans
yet but these should be added in a week or two.

Press release:

Famille Spofulam is please to announce its entry for the Third ISBA THUDDD
competition. The Bludgeon-class Patrol Cruiser is designed around the
philosophy that when patrolling the lawless frontiers of the evergrowing
Imperium, rife with pirates, smugglers, insurgents, and other criminal scum,
a big stick is required.  In this case, the big stick comes in the form of a
3600 Megajoule Spinal mount NPA gun, which allows the Bludgeon to strike
hard at ranges of up to 80 light seconds, well out of the effective range of
most of its expected adversaries.  Its secondary battery consists of five
MFD-coordinated 251 Megajoule heavy lasers, which in themselves are a
formidable threat to enemies of law and order.  Four sandcasters provide
defensive armament to supplement the Bludgeon\'s heavy armour.

All of this firepower is of little use if it cannot be brought to bear,
which is why the Bludgeon is propelled by a 6G Thruster-plate maneuver
drive, and has a 3-parsec jump drive.  Power is supplied by a 1,750 Mw
Zhunastu Fusion Systems reactor, capable of running the maneuver drive at
its maximum output while powering all weapons systems at double their
nominal ratings.  Likewise, in order to detect threats to public order, the
Bludgeon boasts of a full military sensor and electronics suite. 

The Bludgeon is a specialized law enforcement vessel.  While capable of
limited rescue work, it is designed first and foremost to keep the peace, as
a convoy escort, an anti-piracy or anti-smuggling patrol vessel, or in times
of conflict as part of a fleet or as an SDB.  Indeed, the presence of a
Bludgeon in-system should serve as a blood-curdlingly menacing psychological
deterrent (which can be augumented by custom colour schemes at purchasers\'
request) to law-breakers.

The 28-person crew is accomodated in 21 bunks, with senior personnel sharing
3 small staterooms and the captain housed in a single small stateroom.
While spartan, this arrangement was deemed neccessary in order to house the
Bludgeon\'s heavy weapons, power and drive systems in a relatively small 700
ton needle hull.  5 tons of cargo space are provided, and crew comfort is
provided for with a 4 ton lounge.

The price tag for a Bludgeon is 798.7 Mcr.  While steep, it reflects the
Bludgeon\'s excellence as a patrol vessel.  The old Solomani adage "for want
of a nail, the battle was lost" should be remembered here: the vital
interests of freedom of trade and travel throughout the Imperium deserve the
best protection available; the Bludgeon.

Crew Detail: 7 Command, 2 Maneuver, 3 Sensors, 38 Gunners, 
             4 Engineers, 1 Medical, 4 Maintenance + 1 spare bunk

Features: Sick Bay

Description:

GSbAG is pleased to unveil its latest in piracy suppression and  system
patrol craft. The \'Montcalm\' patrol cruiser sports the latest in holo-linked
dyanmic fire control systems and enhanced fusion plants while maintaining
the classic GSbAG jump and thruster systems that have  been honed to
perfection over millenia. A total of 20 laser turrets 
and 4 heavy missle turrets can take on even the most determined threats to
safe commerce without fear. The addition of GSbAG\'s latest in nuclear damper
technology, in conjunction with high-refraction, low-dispersion sandcasters,
means that battles will often be taken without even damaging the hull ID
markings. The \'Montcalm\' sets the standard for system patrol in the new
Imperium.

In addition to standard crew accomodations, the \'Montcalm\' has enough
command crew cabins to support up to 4 extra command staff and has 10 tons
of customizable storage space, suitable for mission equipment or for
supplies on extended patrols. A sick bay is provided to further extend the
range and increase the mission flexibility of the \'Montcalm\'.

Design notes:

I designed two versions of this ship - the second had only 3 heavy and 3
light laser batteries, but put _all_ of the crew in G-tanks and pulled 4Gs.
It cost 780 MCr. It required 7 fewer gunners as well, leaving 8 empty bunks
for ship\'s troops. In each case the hull was built for 6Gs. This other
version of the ship would be good in that it could certainly outrun almost
any pirates, but suffers in that it\'s a bit less well armed.

All the lasers have their power usage increased by 10x to bring them  up to
ROF 100.

The cabin breakdown is 4 large staterooms, 10 small staterooms and  50 bunks.

I think it meets the specs of being well armed, both offensively and
defensively, it meets the jump & manuver requirements and it\'s not
excessively expensive, for a 600 Std ship.

The Torden Patrol Cruiser is Bertlings design for the third THUDDD-contest.
It is a ship buildt with a specially designed 600 displacement tons large
needle airframe hull. A high quality High Energy Plasma Reaction engine
insures a reliable 4G acceleration for the 20G-hours of fuel it has in its
tanks. Using the fuel available in the jump-tanks increases its duration to
about the double. A fuel purification plant is also installed to make the
Torden a more independent ship. Fuel scoops capable of taking aboard 120
tons of fuel each hour are also included. 

Nine 200Mw and two 50Mw powerplants produce the power available for the
Torden, for a total of 1900Mw of power. But even then the Torden has a
shortage of 3.31Mw. But this should not be a problem as there seldom is the
need for running all systems at ones. The Torden has 3 months worth of fuel
available in the power plant fuel tanks. More fuel can easily be transferred
from the other tanks. 

The Torden is equiped with a large array of offensiv weaponry. Four high
quality Laser Tech produced laser batteries gives the Torden the punch it
needs in a firefight. Two missile barbettes each holding 5 missiles insures
that most treats will be handeled in an efficent way. But it is its defensiv
capabilities that makes the Torden the state of the art patrol cruiser. Two
sandcasters and a meson screen gives a high defensive capability towards
laser batteries and meson guns. And to top this of the superdense special
designed hull insures that the Torden will maintain its integrety until most
treats can be dealt with.  

The Torden also incorperates the latest in electronic equipment. The sensor
and communication packages fills the standards we here at Bertling feel
military starships must have. And the controls fills the QSDS-standard for
military ships. 

The Torden also has three docking rings, two 10 dtons and one 20 dton. This
allows for a multitude of different ships to be carried increasing the
mutlipurpose function of the Torden.  

The Torden needs a crew of 22 to function at it peak performance. This
includes a steward and a medic. All crew members have bunks, except for the
command crew, steward and medic which all are supplied with small
staterooms. There is also installed eight extra bunks for troops and small
craft crew. 

Three large staterooms are available. One is the crews common room and
messhall. The two others are to accomodate visitors, military VIPs or
inspection offisers.

New Victoria Naval Architects, LIC, is proud to present its new
Guardian-class patrol cruiser. Designed to meet the combined Imperial Navy /
Imperial Ministry of Commerce requirement for a light combatant craft
suitable for scouting, escort, and anti-piracy 
duties, NVNA believes that the Guardian-class spells the death of piracy in
the Imperium. Its heavy armament - six high-powered laser turrets organised
into two batteries, plus twin missile turrets - is more than capable of
dealing with any pirate vessel encountered, while twin sandcasters and an
armoured hull provide a more-than- adequete defence. And in the event of
multiple targets, the Guardian can take advantage of it\'s superior fire
control facilities and 4G acceleration to stand off and pummel the enemy
from long or even extreme range. 

The Guardian\'s electronics suite matches its armament in quality and
capabilities; it is equipped with an advanced communications suite with
multiple tightbeam communicators to allow it to function effectively in
small anti-piracy squadrons or as part of a larger fleet, and the controls
are radiation hardened for survivability. The sensors are the same
ISDP-standard military package used in NVNA\'s acclaimed Condottieri-class
mercenary cruiser, and ought to be superior to those of most pirate vessels.

The crew are provided with four large and seventeen small staterooms - size
depending upon rank, as according to standard Imperial Navy regulations -
with an extra pair of large staterooms provided for the transport of VIPs,
intelligence personnel or other passangers. In the event that no passangers
are carried, these rooms can be utilised as extra recreational space for the
eight ship\'s troops, who are provided with bunks. Adjacent to the ship\'s
magazine is four tons of cargo space, which can be used as a ship\'s locker,
for the transport of essential cargoes, or as extra missile storage. The
ship is also equipped with a two-bed sick-bay for dealing with wounded.

The Guardian is equipped with fuel scoops, providing wilderness refueling
capability, and its ISDP purification plant is capable of refining a full
load of fuel in seventeen hours. Finally, a streamlined external grapple and
two small staterooms are provided to allow the use of standard 20 dspT small
craft. Currently it is envisioned that the Guardian will be equipped with a
20 dspT armed gig as a utility vehicle, though tests are being conducted as
to the feasability of carrying a pair of light fighters for extra firepower.
In the latter case one of the VIP staterooms will be used to quarter the
necessary small-craft maintenance personnel.

**Important notes** 

This vessel can be constructed at any shipyard that is fully certified to
QSDS1.5 (BTOH).  Although auxiliary craft hangers or launch facilities may
be provided, no auxiliary craft are included in the cost of this vessel
unless explicitly stated below. RGNA accepts no liability for any loss or
injury caused by or related to construction, repair, normal operation or any
other usage of any vessel design aquired directly or indirectly from RGNA or
any associate.

**End of notes**

RGNA proudly presents the Surefire class Patrol Cruiser.  A starship
designed with loving care to meet the most exacting of requirements, the
Surefire class is the ideal vessel for peacetime smuggling/anti-piracy
patrols and inspections, and wartime light commerce raiding, escort and
screening duties.

                2 Aux Craft Crew, 3 Command, 1 Medical	

Notes: 
There are 21 small and 3 large staterooms provided. In normal operation the
command crew will occupy the 3 large staterooms leaving 3 small empty.  Up
to 3 passengers may be carried in either the small or large staterooms, or 6
if double occupancy of the large staterooms is required.

No steward has been included in the standard crew roster as per the crew
requirements rule in QSDS: "Ships that carry high passengers, or have a
total crew larger than 25, must have at least one steward." I have taken
this to mean that the Surefire (21 crew 0 pass.) does not need a steward.
When carrying additional personnel, 1 will need to be a steward if the
reamining 2 are treated as passengers.

Design notes: 

The specification calls for stand-alone operation against groups of
pirate/raiding vessels and the ability to work in conjunction with larger
fleet actions.  I have assumed that the most likely opponents will be
civillian vessels of similar tonnage or light scouts/fighters.  The 3
long-range laser batteries have been chosen to provide a stand-off
capability, with sandcasters and nuclear dampers to provide point-defense.
Given the nature of opponents, a meson screen did not seem to be indicated.
The advanced comms and mil-spec sensors should support coordinated fleet
actions.  Wilderness refuelling is by way of scoops and the purification
plant, and a hanger for a launch or possibly a light fighter is provided.

If I had been able to find my copy of SSDS, I might have designed a custom
hull with more armour, but the one chosen from the Big Table of Hulls (TL
12) will have to do.

My original design was based on the 600 Box S hull, and carried 4x7-6-4-3
laser batteries, a 12 ton hold for confiscated goods and a 10 bunk brig for
prisoners, but cost an extra 200Mcr.  The QSDS worksheets are available at

Notes: The hull was designed by X-TEK specificaly for this vessle.  The USL
400Td Wedge from QSDS was altered to a Strealined config to provide
atmospheric entry and wilderness refueling.  The only apparent difference is
the cost of the streamlining, as the CG Lifters, GravComps, Life Support,
Armour and Internal  Structure were unchanged from the original.  This hull
also has EM Masking ability.  This mission specif hull was not given the 25%
QSDS discount, and this has been calcualted in the cost of the ship.

Hull: 400Td Wedge SL 6gmax   358.5 Useable Td.  107.7Mw  18.4Mcr  1993.0m^2
55m long

Designed to be a Lighning Fast Patrol/Interceptor Craft used mainly for
Anti-Piracy missions.  The "Drakken" can detect a ship at a distance, fire
missiles to "softern up" the target, and then leap from its lair at lighning
speed for the kill.  Its EM Masking ability makes it easy to hide in the
shadow of a gas giant, a frequent pirate hiding spot ,virtualy undetected.
The Drakken is also well armed and armoured for frequent combat activity.
The Medical officer and sick bay are available to patch up wounded
crewmates.  In crisis, the Med Officer can place up to 4 wounded in the
emergency low berths.  We hope that this will rarely happen on this ship,
but we at X-TEK believe in being prepared.

notes:
In the final years of the Sylean Federation, Zhunastu Shipbuilding LIC
produced a patrol cruiser which carried four standard light fighters
according to a plan conceived by Grand Duke Cleon Zhunastu (later Cleon I).
The intention was to overwhelm a pirate with many \'hard\' bogies. The Fenian
follows the same strategy. The main offensive punch is the complement of
light fighters carried in external grapples and a large battery of missiles.
The mother ship is intended to stay safely at a distance; therefore, her
laser weaponry is short range but high ROF for missile defence. A standard
20T launch is carried in a minimal hanger for boarding actions. Four small
staterooms are allotted for inspectors or marines when the mission demands them.

Generica Starships offers the Type 45212 as a modestly-priced solution to
the demand for a anti-piracy and light fleet auxilery cruiser from both
Imperial and megacorporation officials.  Designed to be simple to construct
from standard components and easy to maintain, the Type 45212 can be
delivered in quantity in short order.

The design of the Type 45212 is based on an in-house threat analysis. The
majority of pirate vessals are either commercial starships or converted
commercial hulls with additional weaponry.  As a result, weaponry and
especially sensor equipment of pirates tends to be marginal by military
standards.  Thus, a combination of long range sensors and long range
weaponry allows the Type 45212 to engage and destroy threats at long range
with minimal danger to crew and equipment.

In fleet actions, the Type 4512 will be used as communication and sensor
support for small craft, as well as picket and courier duty.   This ship is
not intended for line-of-battle service, and it\'s relatively high
acceleration capability allows it to disengage from superior forces when
necessary.  Long range weapons, as well as a low-power meson screen, allow
the Type 45212 to operate in a useful way on the fringes of fleet engagements.  

The Type 45212 combines a mix of weaponry in an inexpensive package capable
of both fleet and independant operations.  Defense is a combination of
laser, sandcaster, and meson screens, as well as the potential to carry
small patrol craft to support the mission.  Offense consists of both
missiles (controled by a central fire director) and long-range lasers that
allow the Type 45212 to stand off and engage the enemy.  

Equiped with both a sick bay and fuel purification systems, the Type 45212
is capable of extended independant operations.  With a steamlined hull, it
can refuel rapidly by itself, and is not dependant on auxilery craft.  All
crew members are housed in roomy small staterooms rather than bunks to
provide additional comfort on long patrols.  The three command crew
(Captain, Gunnery Officer, and Chief Engineer) have large staterooms of
their own.  To accomadate additional command personell, two large sterooms
are provided.  By doubling up on crew space, up to 22 additional persons can
be accomadated.

Hanger space for two 5T fighters is provided, along with space for their
pilots.  Since current fighter doctrine is under review, no craft are
included in the bid.  If small fighters are not required under the final
operations orders, this space can be allocated to additional storage,
yeilding 20 tons extra space, or can be used for additional sandcasters or
missile turrets.  However, since it is our understanding that the Imperial
navy intends to retain fighters in the anti-piracy role, our design is
drafted with such craft in mind.

Generica Shipyards used only Sylea Industry Norm (SIN) components in this
design.  As a result, total cost reflects a substantial discount. Volume
production can commence immediatly, with large deliveries as needed.

Design Notes:

This design was a compromise, middle-of-the-road sort of thing, with a mix
of weaponry.  I originally wanted to put in a 100T TL-12 PA-Gun, but it did
not fit, darn it, at least not without compromising the other systems, since
the gun sucks so much power.  With a 600T hull it might just work, but the
QSDS 600T hull is only M2 and 10 points of armor.  I went for some
long-range lasers instead, to give the ship some punch to deal with small
opponents.  

I considered some smaller designs, but they seem less effective to me, since
there are fixed sizes for many of the components (sensors, fuel
purification, meson screen) and that robs space in a smaller hull.

If you decide small craft are not needed, there is room for a few more
things - I sized the power to leave about an extra 50 MW, so one could add
more missiles or sandcasters.

Notes:				
The Monitor Class Patrol Cruiser is designer to provide its owners with a
patrol/anti-pirate craft that can also be used in larger "Fleet Actions" if
necessary.  Designed on the 600 ton hull, it mounts a 3 parsec jump drive
with 3g acceleration provided by state of the art thruster plates.  It also
mounts a 1g contra grav drive giving it a total of 4g for those close
planetary occasions when speed/maneuverability are needed.

Offensivly it mounts 4 heavy laser turrets and 2 heavy missle turrets to
provide the necessary punch/deterrance needed for the patrol/anti-pirate duties.

Defensivly it mounts a factor 3 Meson screen and a 15mw lvl 1 nuclear
damper. It also mounts 2 sandcaster turrets for anti laser defense, and is
equipped with EMM 

In addition it carries a fully equipped sick bay with 16 beds, and 24
emergency low berths if necessary, a 30 ton subcraft ,of the purchasers
choosing(not included in the above price), in the enclosed hanger.  I has 10
small staterooms and 12 large staterooms for crew comfort on those long
patols, and if needed it can carry 6 extra "inspectors/officers" making it a
small command vessel if needed.

Finally the Monitor Class is equipped with fuel scoops and purification
plant to handle wilderness refueling.

While some may consider the Monitor class a bit pricey,  Long Yards
Maintains that we produce only the highest quality starships for the credit
and we back our ships with a lifetime Single purchaser warranty, that is if
you buy the ship from us and something fails (normal use/wear and tear
excluded) we will fix  and or replace the component or the ship if necessary
for no cost to the original purchaser.

Notes: The Akishu Irirkhan patrol cruiser is designed for anti-piracy,
commerce raiding, and system defense roles. However, the design is flexible
enough that the ship can serve in fleet roles as well. It has several
features that set it apart from other designs:

- - Small size. While some may not consider size a selling point, a smaller
ship can be built faster and is a smaller target.

- - Speed. The Akishu can sustain 6Gs of thrust, significantly faster than
most corsairs and smugglers. In fleet roles, the Akishu can be used as a
high-speed armed transport or scout vessel.

- - High survivability. The Akishu Irirkhan design concentrates on
survivability. A heavy armor belt provides more protection than many front
line ships, even though the Akishu\'s primary foes are primarily other
patrol-class ships and pirate vessels. The hull is braced for over 12Gs of
acceleration, which along with the airframe design allows for high speed
atmospheric maneuvering ( useful for gas giant high guard situations ) and
tight turning as well as providing the ability to absorb a great deal of
damage. The crewmembers and passengers (up to two) are provided G-Tanks,
which along with grav-dampers provide over 5Gs of compensation. This gives
the crewmembers a performance edge over other crews.

- - Staying power. The Akishu provides magazine space for 7 salvos of missile
fire - significantly more than most other designs.  

- - Stealth performance. In order to increase survivability and allow for
ambush tactics, the Akishu is armed with an advanced stealth suite. Wide
area jammers, EMM radiators, EMS absorbing composites and stealth-design
gives the Akishu an extremely low detection profile.

- - Crew comfort. Like most patrol cruiser designs, the Akishu is hard-pressed
for space. However, the Akishu uses automation systems to reduce crew
levels, allowing individual small staterooms for the crew, ships troops, and
two additional personnel. The design does not require "hot-bunking", which
can be a source of tension on long missions. In addition, the design
provides a two-bed sickbay and large common area.

- - Multi-mission capability. The Akishu has two six ton multi-mission bays
that are designed to allow quick upgrades and mission options. While these
upgrades cannot be performed in the field (they are not modules, like a
cutter), they can be installed in a couple of days at any class A, B, or C
starport that has the appropriate materials on hand. When empty, the bays
can be used as cargo space ( 6 tons each ) or additional space for
personnel, as each bay has six fold-down bunks. If needed, the ship\'s troops
can move into the bunks, freeing up eight staterooms. Or, the bays can be
used as brigs, as the bays can have security locks placed upon their doors.
The primary power plant provides 10Mw ( 14Mw when the fuel purification
system is offline ) of surplus power for the use of mission modules. Other
options include (but are not limited to ):

* Jump capsule launchers. In this mode, the Akishu can be used as a covert
commando vessel, able to inject up to eight commandos into hostile areas.
Each bay can hold a launcher and 4 capsules. ( Each launcher takes 1Mw,
.05MCr ).

* Additional missile launcher. This modification requires both bays, and
provides a launcher ( (+4) 3/4 ), MFD, workstation/G-Tank, and 12 missiles,
enough for 5 salvos. ( 3.25Mw, 25.68MCr )

* Additional lasers. This modification adds a large laser in a bay and ties
it into the primary laser battery MFD. If one additional laser is installed
(using one bay), the USP rating of the laser battery increases to 1/5-4-2-1.
If both bays have lasers installed, the USP becomes 1/6-5-3-2. No additional
power is required in either case, as the primary power system has enough
surplus power when the fuel purification system is offline. (Each laser
takes 6.9Mw, 2.43MCr). This is a common option in systems with heavy pirate
activity, as the additional firepower gives even the largest corsair a
reason to pause.

* Point defense modification A. In wartime, the Akishu can be converted into
a anti-fighter/anti-missile screening craft for larger vessels by installing
2 MFDs and 2 workstation/G-Tanks into a single bay. The primary laser
battery is then broken up into its three separate weapons, turning the
1x1/4-3-2-1 battery into 3x1/2-1-0-0 batteries. ( 6.2Mw, 51.2MCr ). 

* Point defense modification B. If point defense capability is desired, but
it is undesirable to break up the primary battery, a single heavy laser can
be installed in one bay and a MFD and workstation/G-Tank can be placed in
the other, providing a 1x1/2-1-0-0 battery to supplement the primary
battery. (10Mw, 28.03MCr).

* Additional Sandcasters. Each bay can have an additional sandcaster mounted
it. The setup includes sand dispenser, MFD, and workstation/G-Tank. (Each
sandcaster takes 4Mw, 26.4MCr ). 

* Nuclear damper. A USP factor 1 nuclear damper projector can be installed in
one bay, turning the Akishu into a anti-nuclear picket. This option requires
both bays - one bay holds the projector while the other carries a
workstation/G-Tank,MFD, and auxillary 25Mw power system with fuel. (0Mw,
30.15MCr ).

* Sensor platform. To turn the ship into a sensor picket, an additional
sensor suite can be installed in one of the bays. The modification includes
a densiometer, neutrino sensor, power plant, workstation/G-Tank, and
powerful computers, useful for long-range detection and intelligence
analysis. ( 9Mw, 10MCr ).

* Vehicle bays. The Akishu carries no small craft or vehicles - but any
vehicle up to five displacement tons can be placed in a bay (the lost space
is for bracing ).

* Additional quarters. Although the base design provides two extra
staterooms, it may be desirable to install additional quarters. Each bay can
have either three small staterooms or one extra-large stateroom. The
extra-large stateroom option can be used if the craft is going to be
transporting a noble ( displacing the ships troops with the noble\'s
retinue). Note that the bays have six fold down bunks in each - so that the
ships troops can be displaced into the bays (assuming they are empty)
freeing eight staterooms and still having four bunks. This can be useful in
rescue operations - by filling the bunks and forcing double occupancy
(difficult and crowded, but possible ) the Akishu can carry 58 people - the
crew of 21 (including troops) plus 37 other, more than enough to rescue the
entire complement of most trading vessels under 600tons. It should be noted
that no G-Tanks are provided for these additional quarters, so extra
personnel will be uncomfortable under high-G situations.

* Other options are certainly possible - as long as the system can be broken
into five ton units (the bays are not connected, so larger systems cannot be
installed. If more than 14Mw of power are required, additional power plants
or creative power management will be necessary. It should be noted that it
is not possible to use the modules to provide Jump 3 capability without
other, significant modifications to the ship\'s design. One authorized
modification dispenses with the bays, the ships troops, the extra two
staterooms, and one of the missile salvos to provide space for an additional
30 tons of fuel and a drive upgrade to jump 3. Note that this modification
is not modular - it can only be performed at class A starports and takes
several months in dry-dock to perform. Ships can be build to this
specification ( termed the Far type ) if desired.

Several features of the design have caused some controversy in military circles:

- - The design uses a high degree of automation, contrary to most standards of
military starship design. While it can be argued that the interlinked
systems are more vulnerable to battle damage, the presence of computer
assisted systems and low-maintenance drive units reduces the crew by three
(two engineers and a command crewmember). There is a significant savings in
space (fewer staterooms and workstations) and a slight increase in crew
efficiency by using the automated system. The designers felt that the
Akishu\'s superior defensive capabilities make the vulnerability of the
automated systems acceptable.

- - The starship has a strategic range of only two parsecs, unlike the three
parsec range available at the current technology level. An analysis of space
savings ( primarily due to fuel ) versus deployment strategies prompted the
design choice. As a great number of systems are reachable by jump two, and
several fleet elements ( such as the Military Frontier Cruiser ) only have
jump two capability, the choice seems acceptable. If ranges greater than two
parsecs are required, the Akishu\'s small size makes transport easy.

- - The power plant has fuel for six months only, rather than one year. This
was done to provide even more space, as it was felt that six months was more
than sufficient (patrol missions rarely last that long). If a full year
supply is needed, the power plant can draw upon jump fuel, or a disposable
tank can be installed in a mission bay.

- - The design was constructed using the SSDS protocol, rather than the more
economical QSDS stock-system protocol. This was done simply because certain
design features were unavailable in stock systems. The ship\'s armor,
acceleration bracing, stealth performance, sensor capabilities, and
automation systems were all deemed crucial to the design, and thus SSDS
protocols were used. While ships designed with the QSDS protocols will
certainly be more inexpensive, it is believed that no SSDS design with the
same displacement can out-perform the Akishu. If the the admiralty would
authorize SSDS protocol approved fuel purification plants with smaller
displacements, the Akishu design could be further refined. 

Overall, although several features of the design have drawn criticism, the
Akishu Irirkhan is a solid, advanced design that can meet any adversary. By
comparing the design to it\'s primary target, the corsair, an analysis shows
that the Akishu can out-maneuver the corsair and has superior long range
performance and defenses. By keeping the corsair at a distance (easy to do
with the Akishu\'s maneuverability), the Akishu can virtually guarantee victory.

An exterior image and deckplans of this design can be found on Andy\'s
Traveller Website, at document:

Ce Acatl Corporation is very pleased to submit its entry for the third ISBA
THUDDD Competition:  the CP-5R "Tlaxcala" class Patrol Cruiser.  Tlaxcala
(tlahsh-CAH-lah) was a region of prestellar Terra noted for its proud
warrior tradition; we have attempted to live up to this reputation with our
vessel, a worthy addition to any navy or corporate security force.

A patrol cruiser must be capable of fulfilling a wide variety of operational
roles.  Chief among these are: 

* Commerce escort, customs, and anti-piracy duty
* Search and rescue
* Coordination with larger fleets in system defense and interdiction

The Tlaxcala performs admirably in each of these roles.  In battle, this
vessel is both deadly and tough.  Its primary armament is a devastating 1.3
gigawatt Thompson-Simmons bay laser, capable of crippling (or destroying
outright) most pirate vessels at multi-lightsecond ranges.  As short range
backup offensive and point-defense weaponry, two independent 30 megawatt T-S
turret lasers provide that added measure of confidence any ship captain
going into combat desires.  Twin Dohetti sandcasters and tough hull armor
let the Tlaxcala shrug off any fire from the bad guys.  Finally, an industry
standard missile turret designed expressly for this vessel, linked to an
ample missile armory, gives the Tlaxcala the added punch to deal with larger
targets...and a fully integrated master fire director makes sure those
punches land *hard*.  Finally, the standard crew complement includes four
ship\'s troops, to be employed as escorts during customs inspections, as
boarders, or as security aboard prize vessels.

None of this does any good if you can\'t find the enemy, of course -- and
that\'s why the Tlaxcala mounts an advanced active/passive sensor suite
(conforming to Imperial Navy standards) to help you flush even the
stealthiest quarry from cover.  This capability is an important asset in
search and rescue operations as well, as is the military-grade long-range
redundant commo suite -- critical for coordinating with larger fleets.  If a
ship is in the system...lying in wait for helpless freighters, or drifting
with a blown powerplant and a malfunctioning radio...you\'ll find it in time
with the Tlaxcala.

And get there in time, too.  With a CAC J2 drive, and 4G maneuver
capability, this ship has the legs to get you to the action fast enough to
make a difference.  Fuel scoops and an on-board purifier let you operate
away from civilization indefinitely, for those long
patrols.

The Tlaxcala comes equipped with a two-bed state-of-the-art sickbay, to
handle both routine medical situations while on prolonged duty and
combat-related injuries.  To stabilize more seriously traumatized patients
for transport to a hospital, a 4-person emergency low berth is also provided.

A minimal 20-Std hangar is provided, but no small craft are shipped with the
vessel.  We suggest a 20-Std fast pinnace, two 10-Std launches or fighters,
or four 5-Std fighters.  Our sales department will be happy to discuss the
options with you, and can provide assistance in arranging a coordinated
purchase plan that suits your needs.

With all three command crew in large staterooms, and the 21 other crew in
single-occupancy small staterooms, one large and one small stateroom remain
unoccupied.  These can be used by visiting personnel, as additional storage
space, or as briefing rooms.  More rooms can easily be freed up by imposing
double occupancy on some or all of the crew.

Finally, the price of the Tlaxcala is attractively low -- both in terms of
initial purchase price, and cost of ownership.  Ce Acatl Corporation is
committed to full compliance with Imperial and ISBA standards in ship design
and construction, and to the use of off-the-shelf standard components
wherever practical.  This standardization benefits our customers in two
ways: Low vessel unit cost, and easy acquisition of replacement parts.
Additionally, the craft can be operated and maintained by any
Imperially-certified crew without special training.

The Ce Acatl "Tlaxcala" -- fast, versatile, powerful, inexpensive.  Don\'t
launch your next patrol with anything less!

Designer\'s Notes

The most unusual design element is the bay laser, a bit out of proportion on
this size of ship.  The whole vessel ends up looking like a mount for this
weapon; one might even think of it as a baby spinal mount.  My reasoning was
that for a patrol vessel, having an extremely powerful main weapon would
help end fights quickly, and at long range -- both highly useful.  Just the
deterrant value of a 1.3 GW laser on a vessel this size can\'t be discounted. 

The power and reach of the bay laser helps compensate for the 4G maneuver
rating.  Ideally, a patrol cruiser should be fast enough to chase down any
opponent -- but 6G designs left too little room for the other components I
wanted, and also would have involved going beyond "pure" QSDS.  In the end,
I decided that 4G plus the ability to hit targets at very long range gave
the same operational capability -- if your target tries to run away, you can
keep pounding him for quite a while as he flees at 2G max relative
separation acceleration.

Notes
The Crimson class is Aurelian Industries latest offering to the Imperial
Navy.  Following in the tradition of its "big brother," the DE-7
Gilaadin-class Destroyer Escort, the Crimson class continues the tradition
of partnership between Aurelian Industries and the Imperial Navy. 

Designed to provide the maximum in independence, the Crimson relies on
proven laser technology to give maximum firepower with a minimum of starport
support.  The powerful INSW-23XL Bay Laser serves as the "mailed fist" of
the Crimson, giving the vessel firepower equivalent to many smaller ships of
the line found in the hinterlands of space.  Supported by two synchronized
batteries of high-powered military lasers, the Crimson also boasts a missile
barbette and master fire director.  To further support the independent
operations concept of the Crimson, the ship is also equipped with a 5-ton
missile locker adjacent to the missile barbette. 

With a fully loaded barbette and missile locker, the Crimson can employ
missiles in numerous engagements before requiring resupply. 

But the Crimson is not just weapons; it is also a home to nearly 30 Imperial
Navy officers and men.  Because of this, Aurelian Industries has spared no
effort or expense toward providing an impressive defensive array for this
vessel.  The first element of this array is speed; the Crimson is rated at
5G; nearly as fast as the agile gunboats and fighters of the Imperial Navy.
In addition, the Crimson is sheathed in the latest Imperial Meson Screen
technology, and defended by three point-defense sandcasters and nuclear
dampers.  Should these defenses prove insifficient, the crew of the Crimson
is also defended by the ship\'s armor and enhanced structure, which allows
the vessel to maneuver at the peak of its powerful drive capacity and still
absorb punishment.

The independent operations concept that drives the weapons and defenses of
the Crimson also drive other aspects of the design.  The ship is built on an
airframe hull, and is fully capable of all intra- and extra- atmospheric
operations.  With the Crimson\'s fuel sccops and purifiers, the ship can fill
its tanks and fly almost immediately, and be ready to jump in just over a
day.  The ship also has a small cargo area available for carrying additional
rations or supplies, for longer-range voyages.

However, the Crimson does not have to work alone.  With its fully-integrated
bridge and advanced communications array, the ship can operate with any sort
of task force or fleet assembled by the Imperium or its allies.  The Crimson
is equipped with the finest Medium Military sensors, allowing it to guard
the flanks of a larger fleet, or detect foes while acting independently.
Operating in conjunction with a squadron of other Crimson-class vessels, the
ship can coordinate the search of an entire planetary system.  To aid in
this, four additional staterooms are provided to accomodate a squadron
commander and his staff, or a squad of Imperial Marines for boarding
actions.  With only minor modifications, the four spare rooms can also be
converted into larger rooms for transporting VIPs, or converted into
additional storage or recreational facilities for the crew on a long patrol.
The ship has 20 staterooms; 12 are used by the ship\'s enlisted crew in
double-capacity, and four are used by the ships officers in single-capacity.

DESIGNERS NOTES
Per the April THUDDD announcement, the following requirements had to be met:

1. Must be capeable of standing alone against groups of pirate/raiding vessels.
2. Must be able to work in conjunction with larger fleet actions. 
3. Must be capeable of wilderness refueling (Either directly or small craft)
4. Must be cost effective (not necessarily cheap or inexpensive).
5. Required Minimums/Maximums:
       Size:  600 tons maximum
       Jump:  2 minimum        Maneuver:  2 minimum
      Cargo:  Minimal          Carried Craft:  As Needed
    Offense:  Above Average          Defense:  Superior
       Crew:  Must have full medical facility.
              Must provide quarters for additional command personnell.
                   (For inspections, and transport)

Requirement 1 is met by the VERY powerful main gun (the 50-ton laser bay),
supported by two smaller laser batteries and a missile launcher.  The
missile launcher is even provided additional tonnage for more missiles. 

Requirement 2 is met by the ship\'s "standard" Jump 2 rating, and well above
standard 5G rating.  In addition, while the Crimson class has a weapon good
enough to attack small capital ships, it is equipped with very good sensors,
allowing it to be used as a picket ship on the fringes of the fleet,
supporting the larger Destroyers and Destroyer Escorts.  The ship also
carries the best commounications available for a ship of this size, allowing
it to remain in contact with the rest of the fleet.

Requirement 3 is met via the fuel scoops and fuel purifier.  The Crimson
class has an airframe hull, allowing it to refuel from a Gas Giant, or land
on a world with available water supplies for refueling there. 

Requirement 4 is very subjective, but I feel it is also met.  At just under
700 MCr, the Crimson class is not "cheap."  However, it is tasked with a
mission far more extensive than that of the "Classic" Traveller Patrol
Cruiser.  That vessel was equipped to handle customs/patrol work and light
anti-piracy duties.  It would never have been able to meet Requirement 1,
and its meeting Requirement 2 would be questionable (in my opinion).  In
reality, the craft described in these requirements is closer to a Destroyer
Escort from "Classic" Traveller.  For 700 MCr, the Imperium is getting a
vessel that can be used independently or in small groups for commerce/patrol
work, or even for heavy anti-piracy actions.  Most pirate vessels will skimp
on defenses in favor of space for loot/prisoners, or in favor of room for
boarding troops.  Their offensive weapons will be better, but it would be
doubtful that your "average" pirate would be carrying a 50-ton Laser Bay.
Those pirates large enough or successful enough to carry such armament would
be the targets of a naval task force with several Destroyers, at least, not
one or two Patrol Cruisers.  The Patrol Cruiser would need the firepower to
knock out a light opponent or discourage a medium opponent, and the defenses
and speed to survive and run away from a heavy opponent.  The Crimson class
can fulfill all of these needs, and by that token is Cost Effective.

Requirement 5 is also met.  The Crimson class is 600 tons, Jump 2, 5G, has
heavy firepower and good defenses, and has a sickbay.  There are additional
rooms for carried troops or inspectors, and since the ship has an Airframe
hull no carried craft are needed.  The minimal cargo capacity is enough to
provide additional rations for an extended patrol, and the missile locker
allows the ship to replenish the missles in its Missile Barbette when required.

The Archangel-class Patrol Cruiser continues trans-Rift Engineering
Corporation family of military starship designs based on it cost effective
600-Std needle airframe hull. The Archangel\'s armor (40) and internal
structure (4Gs) have been strengthened over previous designs to support a
wide range of independent and fleet support roles. Weaponry is based on
proven laser turret technology which provides a highly effective short range
destructive power combined with long range capabilities not available with
newer, less developed technologies. Especially noteworthy is tREC\'s
innovative incorporation of reconfigurable laser batteries allowing crews to
redistribute the fifteen laser turrets between the three MFDs to meet
individual mission requirements. In addition to the nominal configuration of
three equal batteries each with a USP of (+4) 1/6-5-3-2, other
configurations are possible providing increased striking power such as: 1x
(+4) 1/10-9-6-3 and 2x (+4) 1/2-1-0-0; up to 1x (+4) 1/10-9-7-4 with two
unused MFDs in reserve. The reconfiguring of the turret-MFD connections in
the central Interconnect Compartment [Engineering Shop] and associated
reprogramming of the MFDs can be accomplished within a few hours.

The Archangel is designed for a wide range of environments and rolls. The
Archangel is equipped with a full military electronics suite and
electro-magnetic masking. Its jump-2 and deep space 2-G capability allow
operations within standard fleet capabilities. The increased 4-G capability
near planetary bodies permits the Archangel to perform effectively both
against or in support of a system defense operations, or independently in an
interdiction or anti-piracy roll. The Archangel\'s sandcasters provide ample
protection against expected threats especially when the Archangel
capitalizes on its mid to long range combat advantages.

With the large sick bay (with a full time medic), emergency berths, and five
large staterooms for transient personnel, the Archangel is equipped for a
variety of long range, independent operations. While some cultures may
consider the bunks for the crew to be somewhat Spartan, these accommodations
have long been considered the norm by the majority of humanity. For example,
crews of underwater vehicles on the Solimani homeworld routinely undertook
extended voyages lasting several months with less spacious accommodations.

Brings to mind Quartermaster Sergeant-Major Alexander Smithers, Queen\'s
Dragoons, who was the epitome of an iron spined British NCO.  The man didn\'t
speak, he barked.  He trembled in outrage at the mere presence of forgien
troops.  And his uniform was always immaculate.

QSM Smithers was designed as the manservant to Major Pith-Downry, a
completely useless upper-class twit.  Together, we explored Her Majesty\'s
possessions, always ending up in one dnagerous situation after another.

I only played him for a short time, but he remains one of my all time favor
ite PCs.

Hmmm... Milieu:1889, anyone?

[rest of solution deleted]

Am I correct in assuming that negametter is what is sometimes called 
exotic matter, i.e. matter with negative energy? (E=mc^2 would imply 
so...)

If so, negamatter can also be used to create a real, 
honest-to-goodness FTL drive -- it\'s used to warp spacetime such that 
the ship travels locally STL, but FTL w.r.t. the rest of the 
universe.

Stepping back into Traveller for a moment, given that FTL drives 
don\'t work in that manner, I don\'t think we can allow thruster 
technology based on it either.

My thrusters operate on a principle related to the interaction of 
real 4-space and the jump spaces.  High realspace velocity 
strengthens the interaction.  (I\'m sure it ought to he high 
acceleration or high rate of energy fluctuation, preferably the 
latter, but I haven\'t thought it through yet.)

Does that mean you can use jump technology to attain near-c 
velocities? Oh, yes, indeed.  But before you rush out and fit 
modified jump drives to small rocks, I ought to point out that for 
quantum mechanical reasons, there\'s an infinitesimal chance of 
actually hitting anything from 100 diameters.

Conservation of canon and conservation of playability are more or 
less obeyed.

Well, since hooking is the oldest form of capitalism (I got what you want,
you got what I want, let\'s trade!), I think that it will outlive the 4th
Imperium.

As for acceptance, that depends on the culture.  Law can\'t always be a
guide, as some states that would seem to be quite restrictive by Traveller
standards have legalized prostitution. (Germany comes to mind.. fairly
difficult to own a firearm, very bureaucratic, but oh, the women..) On
lower-law worlds, the girls might live in slavery, possibly kidnapped, or
even sold by destitute parents.  High tech worlds might do better with "VR"
type fantasy suites that you custom build (wanna bang Empress Marava on her
Flag Bridge?  50Cr!)

Aliens would handle things differently.. if the Vargr do have mating
seasons, odds are they won\'t be interested unless around a female in heat.
The female herself would probably lose all interest during her down time,
although she would still be functional.  There is probably a sub-type of
Vargr folk tale about the cunning female who fools her owner into believing
he is sterile by faking heat, and then not getting pregnant!

The Aslan...  hmmm.. I don\'t know, the typical Aslan male has just always
seemed so.. clueless.  I imagine the females were the ones with the club
upsides the head during the Aslan Paleloithic.  The Droyne make sex
mechanical, almost a ritual.  

A K\'Kree brothel, now *there\'s* a thought.  Given K\'Kree thought patterns,
and the cultural standard of acceptance and complacancy, I shouldn\'t be
suprised if their sex wasn\'t a bit k\'kinky.

Sorry.

Back to the point.. you\'ll probably find working girls (and boys) at most
every port.  The quality, and range of services will vary wildly.

I like your design, it\'s given me some ideas for the Rescue boat I am
designing. But is 3 armour all the way around enough for interplanetary
travel?

Back in Feb. wildstar posted an armour conversion table which listed
QSDS Armour value 0 as being equivalent to a T4 Armour value of 13.

CSC stated that an armour of 3 is required for the front and 2 for other
sides in order to get a sub-orbital "certification".

Question: Is 13 the minimum armour required for inteplanetary travel
when using the VDS? If not (i\'m guessing it is, or perhaps rounded to
10) then what is the minimum?

I guess I would drop out "the most" and replace it with "a".   <shrug>

Well, this number is in dispute.  The latest, most objective
survey I saw was down arond 2% but the number might be up
around 4 or 5%.

[Regarding twins of gay people.]
>Some of these twins were reared apart and they still

This is consistent.  The odds might be 40% that a clone would
be gay.  They might be significantly less (twin studies are
useful but have limitiations).  There just really isn\'t enough
known to say for sure.

>This is a lot better chance than you suggest & what little canonical

My point was to show how low the chance could be (to point out
at you were jumping to conclusions about the clone).  The odds
might 40%.  They also might be 5%.  The fact that the clone is
female also throws a curve ball in all this.  (ie it has _some_
difference in its genetic makeup).

Unfortunately, this probably won\'t work.  Positrons in the AM will
*attract* electrons in the BB shell, and being closer to one another this
attraction will tend to be greater than the mutual repulsion of
positrons/protons and electrons/antiprotons.  Think Van der Waals forces,
but in reverse, so to speak.  VdW forces create a potential minimum at
some atomic separation, which creates an effective weak \'bond\' between two
atoms, but holds them at a slight seperation.  Anti-VdW would then be a
shallow potential *maximum*, easy to slide over, and once inside the
maximum separation the two atoms would slide into contact with one
another, *boom*.  Even at relatively low temperatures, thermal vibrations
would be easily enough to get over this energy curb.

Even if this analysis is wrong for some reason, AM-BBs would be like
super-nitroglycerin in terms of handling.  Any shock strong enough to
break static confinement on even *one* BB would create a tiny M/AM
explosion in that BB, which would create enough shock to set off all the
surrounding BBs, and so on until the whole tank goes up.  Not the sort of
stuff I want on *my* ship!

  S.M. Sterling touched on this with the 3rd book in his Draka series, 
"The Stone Dogs."  In system cold war between the two major powers 
that came out of a different WWII.

  That book has a good example of non-grav tech, in system space combat.

  Actually given the US Navy\'s new mission of projecting force inland, the
Battleship is an excellent platform.  It\'s cheaper to fire the 16" guns
than it is to fire an equivalent number of missles.  The heavy armor on a
Battleship will shrug off anti-ship missles that would cripple a newer
missle boat.
The Battleship also has the room to carry a large number of longer ranged
cruise missles.

Well, not quite the only reason. The PC-jr. wireless keyboard failed for a
number of reasons, the biggest of which was it wasn\'t an IBM standard
keyboard! (IBM was famous for screwing THAT one up, though!) The other
reason was that it was a toy-like chiclet awful thing that was impossible

their \'business\' computer sales by introducing an as-powerful \'home\'
computer, so the dumbed down the PC-jr. a LOT, making it appear like a
worthless toy, and the sales of the thing played that out.

	A wireless keyboard is a decent idea that has failed consistently
for lack of decent implementations, plus the fact that most people don\'t
have a problem with a cord attaching to their computer. Now that most PC
manufacturers have FINALLY gotten away from the \'anaconda coils o\'death\'

and to simple straight cables that are %@$@#! LONG enough, the hassle of a
keyboard cable is much lessened.

   Very true.  It /is/ possible to design a thruster plate which conserves
   both energy and momentum in all reference frames, but they require
   about 1000 times the power input of the canonical thruster plates.

   Aristotle\'s theories were scientific insofar as they followed the
   empirical method; they were speculative insofar as they did not. 
   Due to the technical limitations of his day, Aristotle must have
   found experimentalism a difficult discipline; he seems to have
   indulged in speculation rather more often than respectable scientists
   do today.  His most important contributions come from the inspiration
   he gave to proto-scientists like Albert the Great, Roger Bacon, and
   William of Occam, who rediscovered him after the dark ages.  They
   were all great promoters of experiment and observation, and they
   attributed to Aristotle a similar viewpoint.  In some sense,
   Aristotle can be seen as one of the founders of modern science.

   It was science insofar as it accurately predicted the motion of
   planets and the times for eclipses.  You see, none of the early
   heliocentric theories predicted planetary motions as accurately as
   the established geocentric theories.  The big advantage of early
   heliocentric theories was that they did a better job of predicting
   eclipses.  They also predicted the parallax motion of stars.  The
   fact that we couldn\'t see any such parallax motion was a big blow to
   heliocentrism.

   Interestingly enough, many of the early heliocentric theories of the
   middle ages were at least partly inspired by dualistic theology.  The
   earth, you see, was too vile and corrupt and sinful to be the center
   of the universe.  Only the sun was pure and noble enough for that
   honor.  

   The fact that bizarre sun-worshipping cults believed in heliocentrism
   may have done more to hurt the theory than the lack of apparant
   parallax motion.  Any scientist who proposed heliocentrism had his
   reputation associated with these strange (and occasionally violent)
   cults.  (Just imagine how embarrasing it would be to discover a
   flying saucer behind comet Hale-Bopp!  If you went forward with your
   discovery, you might get branded as a crackpot follower of "Doh" and
   his gang.  Unless you got some /really/ solid evidence, you\'d
   probably be tempted to just say nothing and get on with securing your
   tenure! 8^)

   Very true.  Which is why early geocentrism could be scientific, even
   though it turned out to be completely wrong.

   What has this got to do with Traveller?  Not much, I admit.  But
   there will be cases in future history of science being impeded by
   interference from technical and economic limitations and by
   political considerations.  There will also be cases where it turns out
   that 1990\'s science was completely wrong in its interpretations, if
   somewhat right in its predictions.  There\'s a lot of potential for
   fun here!

Yes, I had decided to accept that.  I figured breaking energy conservation
would lead to bad effects that players would notice sooner than breaking
momentum conservation.

[this works, but 1/2mv^2 is also a fine definition of energy in an inertial

I think we have a data disagreement.  My pocket ref says the earth is 3958
miles in radius = 7916 miles in diameter = 12740 km, so 100 diameters is
1274000 km = 1.3e6km = 1.3e9m.

My calculation above was off by a factor of ten, though - you would end up
a whole heck of a lot farther out than 100 diameters.  1.2e11m is a long
way - the sun is only what, 1.5e11 m away.

1.3e9=5t^2 => t = 16124 s = 268 min = 4.5 hr.
v = at = 1.6e5 m/s, so E = 1.3e10 j/kg

I disagree on the power needed, though.

1.3e10j/1.6e4s => 8e5j/kg = 0.8MW/kg.  This is closer to traveller canon
than my original estimate, but still very high.

Why is there a four order of magnitude difference in the energy we get?
One seems to come from our difference in the distance we are going, but I
think the rest is coming from an error in one of our calculations.  After
the blooper I made that started this, I am not sanguine about whose it is.
 
>Now consider the "true reactionless" drive I mention above.

It might be better to call it a constant force drive.  This is certainly
what current canon seems to want, and differentiates it from one that is in
some way energy limited, and thus not constant thrust.

For 1.3e9m at 10N, I get 1.3e10 j expended per kg.  This matches your
number, save for the G prefix.  Typo?

I am glad that we produced similar results from similar starting points.
Traveller drives need to be sucking down a whole lot more power, or else we
just assume they avoid energy conservation as well.

Yep.  Gravitational potential energy is the energy it takes to remove a
test particle to infinity, and is equal to -GMm/r.  The minus sign vanishes
in most calculations, as you are subtracting the current potential from the
zero point at infinity.

You can get the force by differentiating the potential, and conversely, get
the potential by integrating the force.

>It\'s equal to escape velocity.

In the terminology I was taught too many years ago, they are not equal,
just closely related.  Escape velocity is the velocity such that kinetic
energy equals the potential.  Since you gave the correct escape velocity
below, I am sure you know this, but I wanted to get the terms straight.

0.5mv^2 = deltaE = Pinfinity-Phere = 0 - (-GmM/r) -> 0.5mv^2 = GMm/r
v^2 = 2GM/r

v = sqrt(2GM/r)

Yep.

>So:
>	Potential    = sqrt(2GM/r)    (actually escape velocity)
>	Acceleration = GM/r^2

Or, as I would have said it with the terminology I was taught:

Escape velocity = sqrt(2GM/r)
Potential = -GMm/r
Force = GMm/r^2  (The same thing you got, but with the test mass still in.
F=ma produces your acceleratiom above.)

- ----

Just for future reference, I decide to see what higher acceleration gave us:

Assume 2G instead

1.3e9=10t^2 => t = 11401 s = 190 min = 3.1 hr.
v = at = 2.3e5 m/s, so E = 2.6e10 j/kg
2.6e10j/1.1e4s => 2.3e6j/kg = 2.3MW/kg.

The general case:

D=5gt^2, where g is the number of gees, thus t=sqr(D/5g).

v=5gt = 5 g sqr(D/5g) = sqr(5 g D),

thus E = 0.5mv^2 = 0.5 m 5 g D = 2.5 m g D

And so P = E/t = 2.5 m g D / sqr(D / 5 g) = 2.5 sqr(5) m g^1.5 sqr(D) 

In other words, however broken the system is at low accelerations, it gets
worse at high ones.

It was just an idea, and one that obviously needs more work.  I was
just hypothesizing as to how a PC could acquire a MCr170+ ship through
mustering out.  But on a similar scale, WHY would the scout service
loan out ships to retired scouts when they could be using them
themselves?  I believe this was done so that groups of PCs could have
an alternative to possessing a merchant trader with 30 years of
payments still to be made (you gotta get those PCs from one system to
another, and booking passage on another ship isn\'t everyone\'s idea of
gaming in an SF universe :)

You are talking in High Guard terms.  Things have changed a bit since
then :)

While your example is perfectly valid, it doesn\'t fall into the class
of ship that could be received during mustering out (which is what the
original poster wanted-- to give his PCs the chance of acquiring a
Q-Ship).

facilities for the crew.  Given that I neglected to read the design
requirements before designing it, I\'m amazed that it actually meets some of
them (the ones about combat effectiveness and fleet ops).  I plead extreme
hurriedness; I\'m in exams, and had a very brief timeframe in which to bash
it out.  I originally hadn\'t even planned on doing a submission... I just
seized the opportunity after I finished a paper.

	So, apologies, and everyone please note these shortcomings when
judging it.

	In passing, I\'m really pleased by the way the THUDDD concept seems
to be holding up; three rounds in and we\'re still getting lots of
submissions; like 14 this time around.  I\'m almost beginning to think that
they deserve publication; maybe the winners from each competition could be
assembled into a JTAS article or something?

Actually, mind-bendingly enough, there _are_ different sizes of
infinities.  The infinity of points existing between, say, 1 and 2,
is smaller than the infinity of points existing between, for example,
4 and 6.  No, I don\'t understand it completely.  Ask my dad the

 tonnage or both?  If its tonnage what are the ranges for each class?
 Thanks! >>

Historically, ship designation resulted from the type of mission invoved.
 The modern cruiser was once the "frigate" designed for independent
operations on the high seas.  It possessed exceptional endurance combined
with sufficient firepower to defeat most opponents, or barring that, speed
with which to outrun them.  This required a large, streamlined hull with
considerable displacement(6.500dt - 15,000dt).  

The destroyer, as we now know it, was designed to defeat the ever-popular
torpedo boat that was developed prior to WWI.  The United Kingdom decided
that it required a FAST, well equipped escort vessel that would be able to
interdict any TB\'s, loved by the French and Germans, well before they were
able to lauch a devestating torpedo salvo.  Typical weights(WWII) were
(1,250dt - 3,000dt(Shimakaze class WWII DD)).  Modern destroyers provide the
same escort role although the TB is replaced by the Submarine and Airpower.

Battleships developed from the old concept of "the Ship of the Line".  During
the centuries preceeding the industrial revolution,  sea battles were fought
with set-piece tactics that generally resulted in the better equipped side
reigning victorious.  Thus "Battleships" were developed along the same idea;
 they were designed to be able to stand in the line(the toughest opponents)
and to be able to defeat any lesser ship one-on-one.  The modern Battleship
was a decendant of the HMS Dreadnought.  The first major battleship designed
with a uniform battery of heavy cannons(12 12", if memory serves).  The full
name was actually "Fear God and Dread Nought";  this ship was the harold of
all future battleships up to the supreme Yamato(9 46.0cm cannons) which
massed a whopping 70,000dt and had armor reaching 60 cm\'s in the turrets.
 Typical WWII range 35,000dt(treaty of Washington 1935) - 70,000dt.

design since it mentioned sub-orbital certification.  I just assumed that
there were more things to run into in planetary orbit than in deep space,
so the low armor was enough (combined with the radar to keep out of the
way of big chunks).  Plus, it\'s a high risk, glamorous job flying these
things - it has to be a bit dangerous!

  Seriously, it would not take much to upgrade the armor - it is a fairly
small fraction of the total ship weight.  An overall armor of 12 would
only add about 1.9 meteric tons to mass and take up essentially no more
volume.

  What would be hard is getting it to go any faster - the thrusters make
up 45 metric tons of the 81 tons total mass, plus 10 more tons for the
power plant.  That\'s 10 tons even - part of the reason the ship is sized
the way it is cause I got to an even power plant and thruster number.
Aside from the hull structure (19.5 tons), the rest of the contents are
piddly in terms of weight. 

  Just for fun, I looked at what you get if you doubled the size of the
thrusters and power plant - yes, it will fit in the hull - only takes
about 29 cubic meters more (stronger hull, more fuel, as well as power and
thrusters).  It increases the price from about 9MCr to about 15MCr, and
that buys you a 13.3 G unloaded, 13 G with 2.6 metric tons of cargo.  Of
course, that means the crew has to lie there at 3G for the entire boost
period - not much fun.  I didn\'t look at what increased G comp would be,
but would probably limit performance to more like 12 G due to increased
weight.

  Note that I used 2 crewpersons - I did this for the same reason the
equipment list included at least two of just about everything.  Redundancy
helps in emergencies.

that Norris was not exactly forthcoming on this ), different races within

has all the hatreds been shifted toward other races ?

I know that in my campaigns, the Imperium tends not to have these 
predjudices while the Solomani still hold many of them.  As my campaigns 
are mostly in the Sol Rim and Magyar, this is important.

Not sure I believe your assertion, so let\'s try some figures.  For
simplicty, let\'s have a 1 kg \'ship\' pushing against a 10 kg \'planet\' to
accelerate, with an initial separation velocity of 1 m/s.  For this
initial situation, we have:

Planet\'s rest frame:
  2 KE = 1 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 1 J

Ship\'s rest frame:
  2 KE = 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 10 J

Now, let\'s have our ship accelerate to 10 m/s relative to its old rest
frame.  By momentum conservation, the planet must then add velocity in the
opposite direction of 1 m/s.  So we now have:

Planet\'s *original* rest frame:
  2 KE = 1 kg * (11 m/s)^2 + 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 131 J

Ship\'s *original* rest frame:

  2 KE = 1 kg * (10 m/s)^2 + 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2 = 140 J

Well, whaddya know.  Back to the drawing boards we go.  Can any real
physicists explain what\'s going on here?  I\'d rather expected the
KE-conservation trick to be frame invariant.

 It\'s no longer a question of hibernation (although I must

 I _would_ ask you for one favor, though - if it\'s not too much

 styled more like one of the old "Ship\'s Locker" articles from
 the original JTAS?  Or an "Emperor\'s Arsenal" entry?  This is
 just my personal bias showing; I tend to find "sales brochures"
 rub my fur a little backward - possibly because it\'s virtually
 impossible to avoid them in the Rotten Apple.  Some expansion
 on the laser knife would also be useful.

Because scouts never really retire...notice the restrictions regarding
getting your ships overhauled at scout bases, where you\'re debriefed.
Also, with huge numbers of dispersed scout/COURIERS floating around, I\'ll
bet thet the Imperium is very well covered should a fire erupt on the
frontier; there\'s lots of them to press into service, without having to
maintain a huge ongoing payroll. When the IISS buys scout/couriers on the
scale that they do, I\'ll bet they come a LOT cheaper than even QSDS ships.

Letting scouts retire with a ship is a perfect way of keeping a huge fleet
ready to mobilize anywhere they\'re needed.

That\'s also why I have always loved to play a scout character...you can
quite easily end up with a ship to use.

which has gone and provoked some questions in my mind about the High Guard

related to different rules systems would be appreciated!

The intruder deploys at the GG, and the fleet forms up to perform refuel.
Now, I assume that the line of battle (LoB) deploys as the High Guard, and
the refueling ships form the reserve....

But then a squadron of SDBs engages the reserve from the depths of the GG
and attacks. Now - (here are the questions) - I assume that the refueling
reserve is now the LoB and the High Guard is effectively the reserve? I try
and expalin what I mean in an ASCII section through the atmosphere below:

Classic \'High Guard\':

- --LOB (Intruder)-- (High Guard)
++++++++ Atmosphere of GG
Reserve (Intruder) (Refueling)

Question...

Version 1..
- --Reserve? (Intruder)-- (High Guard)
++++++++ Atmosphere of GG
LOB (Intruder) (Refueling)
SDBs (Native)

If a screening force of escorts is deployed to give the refueling ships a
lower level defense (maybe some fighters ;-) or Fleet Escorts) do we now
have two LoBs (a High and a Low Guard?).

Version 2.

- --LOB (Intruder)-- (High Guard)
++++++++ Atmosphere of GG
Reserve (Intruder) (Refueling)
LOB (Intruder) (Low Guard)
SDBs (Native)

Finally...
And what happens if the High Guard is then attacked by a second defending
force.

Version 3.

circlet-info@apocalypse.org,  http://www.apocalypse.org/circlet/home.html

The story concerns a Free Trader captain who has just paid off his ship
after many years.  As part of a new contract, a corp sends him a
professional girl to entertain him.  The Captain is so entranced, that he
ends up putting his ship back into hock to buy out her contract.

I was always interested in it--I loved those old Jules Verne and

Strange that something can be so interesting to so many gamers (from

Naw, I\'ll admit it.  I wanted KBv2.0 to make only the minimum

Which is impossible, so your definition fails.  How can you determine for
sure (100%) that something is right?  An example I am a scientists in the
18th century, I live in England, I count every Swan I can find, every Swan
I see is white, therefore I propose all Swans are white.  Other scientists
agree so we make a law, "all swans are white".  We then discover
Australia, I decide to visit Australia, and I\'m shocked to find there are
black Swans.  Law broken.

You can never ever have "NO DOUBT".  Nothing is for sure.  You can get
something to a workable point, but thats it.  Thats my only beef, everyone
who has responded so far except for one other poster thinks science cant
be "wrong", its infalliable.  Well, surprise surprise it CAN be wrong.
That above example about the swans is a real life one.

As I said thats my only real beef.  Not even the Aristotle argument really
matters as different schools will consider him a "scientists" while others
wont, BUT science can be, and has been wrong.  No human endeavour is 100%
right, the closest thing I can think of is maths, and thats about it.

Why, because they showed good business sense in doing so?  You can afford
to be a role-playing purist only until you start also running a business;
then such purism is an un-affordable luxury.  

BTW, I wonder why IG hasn\'t done or licensed a Traveller CCG...

As a test, I designed a TL 8 civilian hovercraft that I see as being

meters of cargo space.  Power is provided by a 100 KW improved internal

which is good as they seem to blow up one vehicle per gaming session.

I\'m quite happy about this, since I\'ve always liked hovercraft.  For
TL 9-10 I think they give better atmosphere than clean, silent airrafts.
I also like the idea of 1+g ducted fan craft, though they require very large

   You\'ve got the right idea: photon drives.  Basically, you postulate
   some reaction field mediated by massless particles (say neutrinos or
   gravitons or bosons from some even weaker force) and your
   energy-momentum relation becomes p = E/c.  So your relationship
   between power and thrust becomes P = Fc.  If you use reaction fuel,
   your relationship becomes

   	P = sqrt((Fc)^2 + (rc^2)^2) - rc^2.

   Note that when r=0, P=Fc, as above. In the non-relativistic
   approximation:

   	P = F^2 / (2r).

   Note that without relativistic fields, some reaction fuel r is always
   required to get a thrust.  You can use the values of F and P given by
   the ship-design system of your choice and calculate r; for every
   incarnation of Trav so far, you\'ll find that r is very high, most
   starships can carry only a few minutes worth of reaction fuel if you
   require this reality check.

   These equations assume 100% efficiency in the conversion of power
   into thrust.  If you have some efficiency e<1, then replace P by eP
   in the above equations. Other than the neglect of efficiency, these
   equations should hold true for any type of drive, regardless of
   whether its power comes from some outside power plant, or is
   generated internally by the combustion of some rocket fuel.  Note
   that if you burn rocket fuel, there will be some relation between the
   amount of fuel you burn and the power you get out, governed by some
   "fuel constant" k, which will vary with fuel type:

   	P = kr.

   This leads to 

   	P = F * sqrt(k/2)

   and

   	r = F / sqrt(2k).

   This "fuel constant" k is somehow related to the "ISP" used by
   engineers.  I\'m no engineer, just a lowly scientist, so I can\'t give
   you the exact definition of ISP offhand.

   Hope this helps.

   Energy is /conserved/ in every reference frame, but it is not the
   /same/ in every reference frame.  In one reference frame, an isolated
   system may have 10 Joules of energy at some point in time; that means
   it will have 10 J of energy at any point in time, assuming it stays
   isolated.  In another reference frame, this same system will have 20J
   of energy; this 20J will be conserved at every point of time,
   provided you don\'t change your reference frame. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR
   REFERENCE FRAME IN THE MIDDLE OF ANY PHYSICS PROBLEM, NO CONSERVATION
   LAWS APPLY.  This little proviso in Newton\'s laws is often forgotten
   by quite advanced students (and faculty), and leads to the infamous
   "Twin" paradox, among many others.

   These same concerns apply to momentum as well as energy.

   In your post, you mention "Kinetic Energy" conservation; you probably
   meant to say "Energy" conservation.  Just in case you didn\'t, let me
   emphasize that kinetic energy is not conserved. Here on earth KE
   tends to be converted to heat energy by way of frictional forces;
   this is why Newtonian physics took so long to develop, historically. 
   In the future, we\'ll have nuclear energy being converted to kinetic
   energy by way of the ship\'s drives.  /Total/ energy is conserved,
   /kinetic/ energy is not.

   Gee, this physics lesson was actually solicited.  That doesn\'t happen
   very often!  Thanks!

Then of course there\'s the risk for military apps. A fuel hit wouldn\'t be a
nuisance - it\'d be a death sentence. In fact, come to think of it, a near
miss by an atomic missile or a PAWS could well irradiate the AM suffiently
to set some off - and then you\'re history.

 A life long bachelor with no close relationships with women who rejects
 them because they could not be a close as he was with another man.  I
 don\'t see any doubt that Norris is gay.
 
 Since Norris\'s heir and clone, Seldrian, shares his genes & most current
 genetic evidence suggests (although does not prove) that homosexuality
 is primarily genetic we can probably assume that she was also gay.  This
 might be part of the reason why her marriage to Avery Alledon (Emporer
 Strephons son) failed and their only child was conceived in vitro,
 although the facts that Avery was 20 years younger and that the marriage
 was a political one are other factors.
 
 Arrival Vengence suggests, in the chapter on Strephon, that the Emporer
 Strephon knew of Norris\'s homosexuality.  Certain of his comments to the
 players about Norris need for a heir and how his clone was a good
 solution to the problem suggest he knew the traditional method was out
 for Norris.

probable.  The things that make TL advances possible is the abiblity for
people to be prosperous enough with enough time and money to research new
advances.  Necessity also plays a big part.  

As mankind moves into the far reaches, life will be too focused on survival
initially to be making leaps in TLs.  Small colonies will not have the
ability to reproduce all technologies from their home planets as they don\'t
have room for every specialty and every device.  They take the things they
really need to survive and thrive.  TL advances are going to be sporatic and
uneven in particular areas.  As these colonies develop they will probably not
have enough regular contact to share tech advances and so each develops into
their own distinctive worlds with some shared tech.  

Then with the postulation of a "Dark Nite" or breakdown of lines of
communication and supply and possible breakdown or setback of societies for
whatever reason, sets back the TL again and they start over again (perhaps
from a fairly high TL).  

The discussion I have seen on here seems to assume an even paced development
evenly distributed across the galaxy.  The cool thing about Traveller is that
you can develop "Pocket Empires" with just about any TL and setting you can
imagine.

Take a look at books about homosexuality in history (there are many) or 
works like Bujold\'s _Ethan of Athos_ which describes an all male, all gay,
planet which reproduces through artificial wombs.

I\'d expect rates of homosexuality to vary from 1-2% to 70%+ depending on

most behavior if there is enough cultural pressure.

Actually I LOVE the idea!  I\'m one of those strange people that enjoy this
kind of SF.  Might have something to do with reading to much "Tom Swift,
Jr." when I was young.

How about Traveller: 1950 where it\'s like they thought 1950 would be like
back in the 40\'s?  Complete with "Wagon-Wheel" space stations.  A few years
ago the Smithsonian did an exibite that would have made execellent source
material for such a thing.

The main problem I see is this might be hard to find players for.

	I remember reading an article several years ago about the theoretical
possibility of storing antimatter in the interstices of a crystalline
matrix. I don\'t recall how the author proposed getting the antiatoms IN or
OUT of the storage crystal, but once there, it was supposedly quite secure.

	Hmmm ... on second thought, I\'ve got some serious doubts/questions about
this. How do you start the mapping? I.e. what becomes the first "x" after
the decimal in I, and what becomes the first "y?" Is it simply the first
digit in X and Y? Then what\'s the difference between (100,200), which maps
to (0.120000, or 0.12), and (1,2), which maps to (0.12)? And hence it\'s NOT
a one-to-one mapping. There are an infinite number of 2D points mapping to
the same 1D point, which again shows that 2D is a higher-order infinity
than 1D. Likewise 3D and 2D.

	And it would seem to me that a "true" mapping would be independent of the
base or method of REPRESENTING the numbers, which is simply our way of
describing the "concept" for example, of "10." Using decimal (1dec,2dec)
maps to (0.12dec). In binary (1dec,2dec) is (1b, 10b), and maps to
(0.1010b), which is NOT equal to (0.12dec), it\'s equal to (0.625dec).

	While I\'m not a mathematician, I tend to doubt any mapping which depends
on the way the numbers are represented. Just because GFl\'qrk comes from a
12-fingered race, if he/she/it tries to map the same point from 3D into 2D,
he/she/it should get the same 2D point that I do, even though he\'s
REPRESENTING the point using base-12, and I\'m representing it using base-10.

	Remember, you need a unique mapping. A non-unique mapping is child\'s play
to come up with. Any 2D projection is a non-unique mapping of 3D. But
unless  I\'ve missed something, this is definitely NOT a unique mapping.

We (in our little playing group) have always assumed that TL really relates

After all nothing stops a TL15 mechanic from setting up shop on a TL1 world 
(Spare parts will cost a packet however) just to support all that cool tech 
stuff that they cannot make on planet.
After all, except (perhaps) for some specific industrial secrets (such as 
Fusion Plus), most technology has already been discovered for each tech 
level so knowledge is not a factor but capability is.  Maybe some low tech

   Wizards of the Coast went through some growing pains, that\'s all. 
They needed to regain their focus, and now they are in a position to
start expanding again (let\'s face it, their RPGs didn\'t sell very
well).  I won\'t comment on the total irony involved in their move on
TSR, but I will say that TSR has shown all the signs of being cash
starved the past year or so (sort of like a certain RPG/military
simulation company that used to produce a game called Traveller was
toward the end).  WotC has money apparently sitting around in boxes all
over their offices, so combining the two is only natural from a business
point of view.

   WotC is gambling that the RPG market will maintain its current size
or better yet, will grow.  There are many other things they could have
invested all that money in, many of them having a better payoff in the
short term certainly.  Here is another bit of irony--the company that
many people believe caused the decline of RPGs starting a few years ago
is now getting back into them in a major way.  Is a revival at hand?

Harold

Hyperspace

The basic concept of interstellar travel: that of an alternate space.
Theoretically, hyperspaces are alternate spaces, each only dimly 
understood from the standpoint of our own universe. Jump is defined as 
the movement of matter from one point in space (called normal space) to
another point in normal space by travelling through an alternate space 
(called hyperspace).

The benefit of jump is that the time required is relatively invariant 
- - about one week. If the distance traveled is greater than can be 
covered in one week in normal space, then a gain has been made. 
Hyperspace makes possible enormous gains.

Entering jump is possible anywhere but perturbations due to gravity 
make it safest to begin a jump at least 100 diameters out from a large 
massive body such as a world or star. Ships are naturally precipitated 
out of hyperspace before they get too deep into a gravity field.

Normal jumps take 168 hours (plus or minus 10 percent) to complete,
regardless of the distance traveled.

Sometimes a jump goes wrong. Catastrophic failures (called misjumps) 
can destroy the ship and its crew. Other failures can destroy a drive 
or send a ship in the wrong direction. Some misjumps reduce a jump-6 
to a mere jump-1 or convert a jump-1 into jump-10 or higher.

Jump Drive
The combination of equipment required to insert a starship into 
hyperspace and project a jump field. This consists of four components: 
A high-yield fusion power plant which energizes the second component, 
an energy sink array (usually constructed of Zuchai Crystals); when 
the jump point is reached this energy is transferred to a jump grid 
(usually of lanthanum) on the ships\' hull under the control of a
jump governor. The jump governor is a computer controlled device 
which energizes the grid in a sequence determined by the jump to be 
undertaken.

The charging of the jump grid creates a particle field which allows a
starship to enter hyperspace. It is this field which encloses a 
normal-space "bubble" containing the ship. As long as the field is up 
the ship remains in hyperspace.

The field is generated by the jump grid. Once the grid reaction is
initiated, it cannot be stopped. It must be allowed to run its course.
It takes some time for the reaction to end; this time is 168 hours +/- 
10%.Once the reaction is completed, the particle field is no longer 
being replenished, and hence the ship naturally "precipitates" out of 
hyperspace.

Lanthanum is used in the production of the jump grid because its 
properties are such that it is the most efficient at "cooling". Other 
rare earth elements can be substituted at the expense of longer times 
for jump.

Okay, this begs the question, just what is the position of gays in Imperial
Society? Is it a big thing or only asked when figuring out whether to make

   Well actually you have to differentiate between being homosexual (or
bisexual) and committing a homosexual act.  Many people who are not gay
experiment sexually, particularly when they are young.  

   In the case of the ancient Greeks, it was not uncommon for an older
man (30s-40s) to take on a young man (late teens) in a mentor role and
for that relationship to become sexual.  The Spartans were known for
their strict segregation of the sexes (husbands and wives did not
routinely live together), and that homosexual relationships were very
common, though Spartan warriors took wives just as other Greeks.  As for
the Romans, the activities of the upper classes are well documented,
though perhaps at times exaggerated (particularly Caligula\'s orgies). 
Homosexuality was not a particularly big deal in pagan Rome, but as the
Empire became a Christian one, attitudes changed.
 
   As for 19th century sailors, being without female companionship for
months at a time in close quarters tends to make the guy in the next
bunk start to look pretty good (particularly when you haven\'t taken a
vow of celibacy).  This also explains to a degree the amount of
homosexual activity in prisons.

   I would say an average for a truly gay population would be around 2
percent, though the percentage engaging in homosexual acts could range
from 0 to 100 percent depending on the culture, government, law levels,
etc.

Simpler than looking at a sector map of the Spinward Marches and
simply counting hexes?  What if you wanted to determine a long passage
with multiple stops?  Now be honest...

I\'m not saying that a 3D map would be complicated.  Just *more*
complicated than a standard 2D map like we have used in Traveller for
years.

Ok.  By Traveller\'s own admission, "retired" scout characters can gain
the possession of a Scout/Courier during mustering out.  Literally,
NO, they do not retire.  I was basing my statement on the former usage
of the word :P

This doesn\'t say much for the proposal Ian mentioned, that no Navy
would "lend" out Q-ships to "retired" personnel due to the fear that
they could be used against them of for criminal activity.

Me too.  None of that, "Can\'t make my payments, gotta swipe the ship,

        Douglas is right, when we speak just of cardinals. The cardinal of R
to the n (the set of real numbers to the n: R**2 is the plane, R**3 is the
space) is always c, or aleph-1, the continuum cardinal. And yes, Joseph,
it\'s not intuitive, but the infinity of points in (1,2) is c, and the
infinity of points between (4,6) is also c. These two sets are bijective,
and the bijection is b(x)=2x+2. All the theory of transfinite numbers, which
happens to fall under my algebra specialty ;-), started back with good ol\'
Kantor... who ended his days in a psychiatric institution. So, don\'t bother
too much with these questions. They\'re dangerous.
        Nevertheless, on the issue of 2D<->3D conversions, I think one
should be interested in more than bijections. The cardinal of the set is not
the only important thing, because R**3 and R**2 have a structure, and it
matters a lot for mapping purposes. R**n is a linear metric space endowed
with, e.g., the euclidean distance. And, as linear space, R**n has a
DIMENSION of n (and this is totally different from the cardinal concept).
And two linear spaces of different dimension CANNOT be isomorphic, i.e.
there is no possible bijection between R**2 and R**3 which maintains the
"structure". In other words, a *general* 2D<->3D conversion has,
necessarily, to be a real mess...

        Right... but the *fact* that there are no other infinities between
aleph-0 and aleph-1 is actually a hypothesis (the continuum hypothesis), so
things are even more complicated than that.

        I asked recently the same question. From the answers I got, yes, a
grand total of TWO mathematicians by degrees (Scott Ellsworth and me),
although three more people wished to be counted as half-mathematicians...

        Traveller reference: Well, I\'ve never discussed this because it
would need too much explanation to a non-mathematician to be interesting,
but, as Douglas and Joseph have raised the issue (so I can say \'it was not
me\' <g>)...

        An introduction to Yet Another Jumspace Theory
        ==============================================

        The structure of the set of transfinite numbers reflects the
physical reality. There is a bijection between the set of transfinite
numbers and the set of physical spaces. Aleph-0 is associated to real space,
while Aleph-n (for n>=1) corresponds to Jumpspace-n. Basically, the
corresponding cardinal measures the possible "meta-quantum situations" that
a particle can be in, in the corresponding space. A "meta-quantum situation"
is a complete specification of energy level, probability distribution over
location, and all other necessary physical characteristics.
        The lanthanum grid has the effect of exponentially increasing the
variance of meta-quantum situations in the particles of a body. In the
limit, the body cannot be contained in its space and so "jumps" into the
appropriate one.
        The set of transfinite numbers is discrete only if the continuum
hypothesis is accepted. The discovery of jumpspace requires a deep
understanding of the transfinite number theory. Those races who do not
incorporate as an assumption the continuum hypothesis have failed to
discover the jump-drive.

        Douglas example was made, IIRC, only for irrational numbers. Your
counterexample uses rational ones. You can delete all rational numbers from
R and still have the same cardinal, so they are irrelevant. Never mind, even
if a given example is not a bijection, that does not prove anything as you
seem to believe. It does not \'show\' anything. Equivalence of cardinals means
existence of bijections, not that every map is a bijection. The fact that
the cartesian product of sets of a given transfinite cardinal has exactly
the same cardinal is in any undergarduate algebra textbook. But refer to my
previous post: dimension is not the same than cardinal.

        The set ob bijections between R**2 and R**3 is... infinite. And it\'s
not clear which infinity <g>. These maps are non-unique. Sorry, any
conversion would be a convention, depending on the way numbers are
represented, or any other arbitrary criterion. No way around this. No
"canonical" mappings.

        To summarize:

        1) 2D-space can be made bijective to 3D-space. No problem. It\'s proved.
        2) There is no \'canonical\' way to do this bijection. Infinity of
possibilities.
        3) There is no bijection respecting the linear structure
(isomorphism). Any conversion has to be a mess.

        The only way around it, of course, for game purposes, is to add a
dimension to you 2D space by noting some number or colour which refers to
the third dimension. But the you are using a 3D-space...

When you say "In the Third Imperium" do you mean opinions held by people
and governments on planets within the Third Imperium or do you mean
opinions held by the Imperial government itself ?  These are not the
same question.  

I think that the short version of the answer is that many planets do
have some predjudices, some planets are very predjudiced, and some
planets are unpredjudiced.  The people from these planets tend to hold
similar opinions but if & when they enter Imperial Military service they
will probably be tought that these differences are unimportant.

Most, but not all.  Remember that non Solomani all come from a small
gene pools and thus tend to be more racially homogeneous than
earthlings, or even than earthlings from the same country.  I think that
_cultural_ predjudice will be the most common type, but that this will
have some implicit racial (human sub race) predjudice as well.  For
instance the First Imperium was clearly predjudiced against non Vilani
and the Second Imperium was clearly predjudiced against non Solomani. 
Arguably the Third Imperium has some predjudices against those who are
not Vilani, Solomani, or Sylean.

South African style racism will probably be the most uncommon type of
racism out there however.  Most members of the Third Imperium are from a
blend of Solomani and Vilani stock.  Vilani are rather dark skinned, and
most Solomani are not caucausian either. Therefore most Imperials
_are_not_white_ (although this would be more apparent if more art from
CT & MT was color rather than black & white.  Since most people in the
Imperium will be dark skinned they are unlikely to have South African
views.

As above I suspect planets discriminate but the Imperium does not.

> or has all the hatreds been shifted toward other races ?

Well I think that hatred of some races (I won\'t name any names but these
massive herbivores inhabit an area known as the 2000 Worlds...) is in
fact a good idea that should be encouraged.  But in general I would
suggest that "discrimination" against non humans is really not the same
thing as interhuman discrimination.  The current racist ideas about
human subspecies are based on perceived differences that are far smaller
and more subtle than those between different species so I think that far
more people will discriminate against other species.  The most common
type of anti alien discrimination will probably be _True_ however and
will thus be valid.

The alien races in Traveller do have noticable traits and it is not an
unreasonable pattern of behavior to engage in what is called statistical
racism towards them.  (Statstical racism is behavior that treats the
individual as a part of the group he/she in in.  For example when an
employer is reluctant to hire a female employee because of his belief
that she may quit her job if & when she become pregnant (thereby wasting
the money spent training her) he is acting based on the quite accurate
data which indicate that the number of pregnant women who quit their
jobs is significantly larger than the number of pregnant _men_ who do
so.) It seems to me to be perfectly valid to treat aliens in this
mannner.  I think that anyone who is going to deal with a Vargr needs to
understand Vargr psychology but the level of popular understanding of
Vargr psychology will not necessarily be much above that of racist (but
somewhat true) slogans such as "You can\'t ever trust a Vargr because
they will betray you." or "Vargr workers are more trouble than they are
worth because they are always so pushy towrds you."

Cannonically the Third Imperium shows discriminatory behavior towards
non humans, especially nonhuman minor races, and against human minor
races.  It could easily be the case that some of this discrimination
against human minor races is due to dislike of some of there practices.

For example in my Third Imperium the Darmine human race have an both a
very high incidence of bisexuality and homosexuality and a polytheistic
religion one of whose primary (and annoying) tenants is the
numerological belief that anything that happens in fours is significant.
When I played a Darmine charecter (Baron Captain Trier dehah Tarlineal
Imperial Navy flight branch) the other players and the NPC\'s seemed to
accept his flagrantly promiscuous bisexuality as an eccentricity but
were driven nearly crazy when he would say things like "Of course
something important was going to happen on this planet because this is
the 4th planet we went to after leaving Capitol/Core in this Jump 4
Yacht, that I was the 4th crewperson hired for, on a journey across 4
sectors.  Somehow the party found this smugness a little hard to take as
we were calming down from our encounter with at an Ancients site :) 
Their intolerance of his numerological crazyness was cultural
discrimination against him but it was entirely justified.

>I know that in my campaigns, the Imperium tends not to have these

The Solomani clearly discriminate against non Solomani but I do not
think that they usually have very much subspewcies (racial) predjudice,
the beliefs of the Dootchen Estates do not illustrate Solomani racism in
general but rather they illustrate the weakness in/ freedom allowed by
(pick one) the Solomani Confederation.

One thing. I\'ve been *looking* for a statement that gives "uncertainty
in position". I\'ve found several dealing with uncertainty in *time of
emergence*, but *nothing* about position.

So if *anyone* has references that give a *positional* uncertainty in
emergence, I\'d like to hear about them.

BTW, given a "typical" orbital velocity of 30 km/sec, a one hour
difference in time of emergence means that the planet has moved 108,000
km or about 3.6 light seconds. 

So part of any "uncertainty" is going to be the uncertainty in the
position of the destination with respect to the starting point. It\'s
not easy to determine the relative positions of planets in different
stellar systems!

Probably by a variant on the trick used to map 2d space to a 1d line.

To do the 2d to 1d mapping, you just take the co-ordinates(X.xxxxx,
Y.yyyyy) and convert them to XY.xyxyxyxy.... This *does* give a unique
mapping. But it\'s not a *useful* mapping. 

Hmmmm. For 3d to 1d, it\'d be (X.xxx...,Y.yyy..., Z.zzz...) -> XYZ.xyzxyz...

So use that as an intermediate and you get something like:
    XX.xxx..., YY.yyy..., ZZ.zzz...
    XYZXYZ.xyzxyzxyz....
    XZY.xzyxz..., YXZ.yxzyx...

Or a "simpler" way is just take the "odd" digits of the X, Y, and Z
co-ords and turn them into the digits of the X co-ord, and the "even"
digits into the Y co-ord.

It *works*, especially with a hex map or squares. But the results are
hardly intuitive, or conducive to visualizing things. And distance on
the 2D map has only the vaguest relation to distance on the 3d one.

Well, Tandy made a good living off of the Tandy 1000 line, which was
specificly designed as a PCjr compatible. My 1000 TL/3 has almost
completed the transition to fully PC compatible, yet it\'ll still accept
the PCjr\'s "good" points (the enhanced graphics, and the sound). In
fact it has *improved* on them. I get 640x200x16 graphics on a CGA

Except that the exhausts are *incredibly* narrow. And with their
exhaust velocity, they tend to drill holes into soil and rock rather
than splash. 

I also figured that there was a reason Type D(?) ports were "a patch of
bare rock".

It doesn\'t *matter* how you get it, whether fusion or "high energy
plasma". The exhaust velocity (and thus temperature) is gonna be very,
very high. 

But do note that small rocket engines are used to drill thru hard rock
right now!

Huh? What\'s the Isp given for HEPlar? My (old) references gave fusion
rockets a theoretical Isp of 600,000.

Isp = thrust (in "mass" units) divided by fuel flow rate (mass per sec).
I=t/(m/s)
6e5=1e5/(m/s)
6=1/(m/s)
6*m/s=1
m/s=1/6

That means that you can get 100 tons of thrust (1e5 "kilos" or 1e6
newtons) with a fuel flow of 1/6th *kilogram* per second. 60 G-hours
for a 100 ton ship would be all of 10 *kilos* of fuel. You get 720
hours (30 days) with 120 kilos.

This also shows why landing isn\'t a problem. The exhaust is *hot*, but
there\'s so *little* of it, that it cools quickly. So things that are
"in the way" get blasted to hell, but stuff a few meters away is hardly
touched.

But take a good look at what *real* fuel flow rates get you. Getting
the performance to match isn\'t all that hard.

Negamatter is a *form* of exotic matter. Not all things identified as

The Alcubierre warp drive requires more than "just" exotic matter. They
"destroy" spacetime in front of the ship and create it behind it.

Sure we can. Alcubierre drives are up around Grandfather\'s tech level.

I suggest that you try it. But don\'t forget that you have to measure
the KE and momentum of both the ship *and* whatever it is pushing on.
When you do that, it *is* frame invariant. That\'s because it *is*
actually pushing on something.

I *think* that my "true reactionless" drive violates conservation of
momentum in all frames, but conserves energy in all frames (it\'s
required to obey W=FD in it\'s own frame, and I think that transforms ok
into other frames)

The jump drive operates by opening a hole into a type of "hyperspace",
called jump space strangely enough.  There are 36 known "levels" of jump
space, although only the first six are able to be used reliably.  

A ship\'s jump drive is a large fusion plant, designed to burn a great amount
of fuel in a very short period to provide the burst of power needed to tear
open the hole in normal space.  There is some debate as to how much jump
fuel is actually used as fuel, and how much is used as coolant, but that
seems to be more a matter of style.

Starships have either inner jump coils (Classic Traveller) or a hull grid
(Mega Traveller+) made of lanthanum.  (I prefer the hull grid theory.)  The
lanthanum is vital to opening the jump hole, and is quite valuable as a result.

The mechanics of astrogation are glossed over in the rules... there is a was
to set your course, but we aren\'t really told what it is.  Most starports
sell or provide pre-set jump coordinates for neighboring systems.

Each jump number indicates what level of j-space it can enter.  A Jump-2
ship can enter jumpspace that will allow it to travel 2ly in approx 168
hours (+/- 10%).  The largest jump possible, at TL15, is six.  The only way
to jump further is through an uncontrolled mis-jump, which can take you up
to 36ly away from your starting point!

I see TL as being the level that the world could maintain if cut off from
interstellar contact.  A world may import higher TL gear, but it\'s the
ability to manufacture and repair that counts.

Don\'t be too sure about technology trickling down from high tech worlds..
Here on Earth there are still areas operating at TL2-3, while we chat away
on our TL8 computer networks.  Cultural attitudes, legal restrictions, lack
of resources, all these can lead to a world lagging behind in TL.

True, but who are his customers?  Odds are, he\'s going to be near the
starport, and most of his work will be done for visiting spacers.  It\'d be
much like setting up a computer repair shop in the highlands of Papua-New
Guinea, the customers you get will be grateful to find you, but it may be
*years* between them.

Vilani settled/influenced worlds, with their attitude towards the ownership
of technology, are not going to be that quick to advance; it\'s simply
against what they know is right.

Rather than universities, the big agent of change in the Imperium is going
to be the Navy and Marines.  Imagine a farm kid from a TL4 world joins the
Marines.  He sees and learns to use equpment that is one step removed from
magic, and sees how easy life is with these tools.  After four years, he
returns home, and starts improving things on the family farm using
techniques he learned in the INMF.  Enough of these vets, and you\'ll see a
slow, steady rise in TL.

More like a Columbian Cocaine Cartel buying out Nestles.  WotC is a

I\'m hoping that they give AD&D the shot in the arm it needs, both in writing

As a bisexual man, who has known since I was 12, might I suggest that I
might know a little bit more about the subject?  There is plenty of evidence
that sexual orientation is geneticaly linked.  Studies of twins, for
example, show that in about 40% of the cases where on twin is gay, the other
will be also.  
There is no one factor that causes someone to beccome gay or bisexual, but
NOBODY chooses to be this way.  Never mind the fact that you wouldn\'t be
getting the right signals from a same sex partner, but why would anyone want
to be part of a minority that is deomnized on a daily basis.

Too much said.

Sorry about the rant, and I didn\'t really mean to out myself on the TML, but
I\'ve spent the last 10 years fighting exactly these misconceptions.

So if I have correctly understood your theory, in real space (Aleph 0) the
particles can be in distinct energy level (as we know). And in Jspace 1
(Aleph 1) those particles can assume any level (As Aleph 1 is the number of

The regular view on the grid is that it protects the ship from the J-space
(IMHO again). In this case the inside of the ship is cannot be protected

mathematicians on the list. Just lending my support to my comrades in
arms...

Another more interesting (relevant?) topic, has to do with another branch
of Mathematics that deals with random walks. In this there is a discrete
difference between 2D and 3D space.

If you have a 2D integral plane. Mark one spot as "the ship" and another as
the starting position for "The Drunken Sailor". Each move the drunken
sailor takes a step in one of four random directions. You can prove that,
given an infinate (aleph-0) amount of time, the sailor is garunteed to
eventually reach the ship.

If you have a 3D integral plane. And do it the same. You can prove that,
given an infinate (aleph-0) amount of time, the sailor is not garunteed to
eventually reach the ship.

There is no obvious or intuitive reason why.

Bad news for Voyager fans I guess :-)

	Hey... that\'s my idea!  I\'m already working (or was before school
got in the way) on a timeline, and was planning on bashing out some designs
once I got out of school.  I\'m planning on throwing in a really heavy Cold
War paranoia spin on it.

	I do have some preliminary timeline work done, up until the early
\'50\'s.  If anyone wants to see them I can email/post them...

Bully for you, Douglas!  After my loud and public tangle with "Solomani"

Wouldn\'t you think science-fiction readers and RPGers, if anyone, would be

The point was - if you look at the equations - thurster plates don\'t conserve
energy in every reference frame...which is a big clue that they\'re

The problem with that is that the efficiency is terrible; to accelerate a
100-DT starship at 1 G would require 3x10^15 watts, which is a bit much 
even for Traveller power plants.

With his comments considered, are we creating Traveller starships with
unrealistic displacement tonnages?

Lets look at some ratios.

CT Close Escort  400dT	WWII  CE  1250 - 3000 dT   (2200dT median)

Ratio of dT  0.32

CT Merc Cruiser  800dt	WWII  CR   6500 - 15K dT  (11K dT  median)

Ratio of dT  0.12

CT BB/BR  50K dt?	WWII  BB  35K - 70K dT  (53K dT median)

Ratio of dT  0.94

Do we create a BB/BR closer to the CT Escort or Merc Cruiser ratios or should
the CE/MC be larger?

Personally, I like designing smaller ships and would recommend that a Traveller
BB/BR not be larger than 5000 dT which would be a ratio of 0.10.   This works
within the QSDS/SSDS lists I have seen on the web.  

Also, I assumed that Scottwas using metric tonnes of displacement.  Correct
me if I\'m wrong.

This is based on nothing but pure conjecture, but perhaps the more 
beaurucratic and culturally stagnant didn\'t even name their star ships.

When you think about it, our habit of naming ships has no real practical 
purpose, and is pretty arbitrary. I mean, why name ships, but not cars or 
buildings (for the most part)?

Thanks, Leonard -- I hadn\'t gotten back to this yet.  Yeah, since I didn\'t

units you like as long as the dimensional analysis works out.  (Furlongs

Naw--just jump on the wagon.  It seems many on this list like to dog 
TSR.  I find that strange when D&D is the most successful RPG in 
history.

To tell you the truth, I never knew about a problem with them until I 
heard it here.  

D&D is near and dear to my heart.  Traveller is too, but I\'ve got to 
tell you--I\'ve never had the abundance of rules problems with D&D 
products that I have with IG.

To date, I\'d say that TSR turns out more consistent, well designed 
products that have high production values than some of the expensive, 
bug ridden, overvalued stuff that I\'ve bought from IG.

I\'ve always felt that most of the Traveller products, for any 
edition,were not up to the standards of the stuff I purchased from 
TSR.  It wasn\'t until IG came along with T4 (and, with all my gripes, 
I thank God for that), that I felt I was getting ripped off buying a 
product.

There were very few times that I felt that way when I bought a D&D 
supplement.  With the 8 items that I\'ve bought from IG so far, I feel 
that way about most of \'em.

These T4 things are just damn expensive.  I wouldn\'t mind the cost so 
much (although it should definitely be turned down because others 
aren\'t as tolerant as I am) if I felt that these were just fantastic 
products.  So far, I am only really excited about one--the EA, and 
although I do like it a great deal, the book is still pretty small 
for the close to 25 bucks I paid for it.

This got me to thinking... when creating a battery of turrets do you:

a) combine damage values from all the turrets and then produce a USP

or 

b) convert a single turret to USP values and then add the turrets
together?

basically, the way I read it is that if your individual turrets
have USPs like 1-1-0-0, they\'re never going to have anything
but 0\'s for the long/extreme ranges (or whatever they\'re called).

SSDS is a bit foggy on this point.. no, upon checking SSDS says
to do (b). Did some people do (a) ?

As for the ancient Greeks, particularly the Stoics who are most commonly
the ones thought of with the man/boy relationship, I understand that a
great deal of the common belief about their cultural homosexuality is
overblown.  Just as homosexuality in other cultures used to be totally
ignored, recently it has been exaggerated.  I\'m not a scholar of ancient
Greece, but from talking with people who are, it seems likely that their
incidence of homosexual behavior was not much different from our own (2-3%,
not 3-5% or 5-10%), and that it was tolerated in some sectors, but not as
openly as people have been made to believe.  I also learned (sorry for
being graphic) that the punishment for anal sex in at least some
parts/times of ancient Greece was to have a very large turnip shoved inside
you and pulled roughly out.  Often this killed the accused person.

I\'m excited about how my Vehicle design workbook is coming along, so I
want to share it with TML\'ers and solicit feedback. My workbook, which I
call the Traveller Vehicle Factory, is *more* than just a spreadsheet,
it includes Visual Basic macros and super-spiffy dialogs for
unparallelled design efficiency.

It requires a minimum of MS Excel version 5.0, I would also like to know
if it works as well on later verisons. Theoretically, it should work on
both PC and Mac platforms, but as I only have Mac version 4.0, I haven\'t
been able to check it on my home computer.

The Traveller Vehicle Factory hasn\'t yet been linked to my website; I\'m
planning a massive overhaul of my site this weekend. However, the
pre-release zipped version is accessible via this URL:

http://www.geocities.com/Area51/8275/vfactory.zip

Use your favourite unzipping utility to expand it. (eg. winzip for PC or
unstuffit for Mac)

If you\'re still unconvinced, here\'s the Intro sheet from the workbook:

- ----begin quoted material----

Welcome to the Traveller Vehicle Factory!
v1.0a1 by Glenn Hoppe (jumpspace@geocities.com)

What It Is: Hopefully you\'ll find this workbook to be the easiest and
fastest way to design vehicles using Traveller Vehicle Design System
rules. The full rules for vehicle design can be found in the T4 Central
Supply Catalog.

Why Alpha? I\'m calling this spreadsheet an "Alpha" release, not because
I consider it buggy, but because it is feature incomplete. (Or
alternatively, complete with undesired "features") I\'m releasing it now
to solicit feedback, contructive criticism and hopefully praise and
encouragement, so that I can make this the best dang-gum tool to design
vehicles this side of Sylea.

Quick Start: Click on the Design tab below to bring up the Design
worksheet. There are grey buttons in Columns B & C which bring up
marvellous dialogs allowing you to enter vehicle component values
quickly and easily. As an added bonus, spreadsheet results are
(nearly)instantly updated once any part of the dialog is changed, so you
can experiment with values quickly and easily without ever having to hit
the "enter" key. Dialogs include way-cool drop-down menus, so all you
should have to type are the numbers.

I\'ve used Excel\'s outlining capabilities to allow one to "zoom in" on
the individual component calculations, or "zoom out" to get the big
picture, and see all the subtotals at a glance. If you get confused,
just press that small "3" top left side of the sheet to see the whole
picture.

Some "Quirks" include:
  - The cancel button in vehicle component dialogs does not actually
cancel (yet). Be careful! Anything you change in the dialog takes effect
immediately, and your old value cannot be retrieved.
  - If a change is made "manually" in the pink areas of the design
spreadsheet, vehicle component dialogs do not update to show that these
changes were made (yet).
  - A lot of the dialog macros have the pink data positions "hard
coded". Use extreme caution when inserting cells, rows, columns, etc.
(Just don\'t do it. I\'m considering resurrecting a more flexible design
from an old FF&S spreadsheet I made ages ago...)

Some other things that aren\'t yet done, and future ideas:
  - So far, there are design dialogs for the following components: Hull,
Power Plants, Propulsion, Communications, and Sensors. Other data needs
to be manually entered in pink areas of the spreadsheet.
  - Alternate dialogs: For example, a dialog that allows you to directly
enter armour values for each facing instead of armour thicknesses would
be cool.
  - Weapons! I haven\'t yet made a weaponry dialog.
  - Turrets: still working on that.
  - Modular components: You can specify that the hull is modular, so the
requisite structural costs are added, but specific components cannot be
made into a "module". I just enter the +10% volume and +50% cost in the
"Other" section of the sheet.
  - Vehicle database: My insidious plan to permanently keep vehicle
designs within the spreadsheet itself.
  - Summary/Export Functions: Have obvious value. Soon, yes, very soon.
  - Toolbars and/or menus: Once everything else is done, 
  - A multitude of other things I can\'t think of off the top of my head.

Shoulders of Giants...yadda yadda... The design of this workbook was
inspired by one I downloaded, which did not contain the contact info for
whoever created it. I hope that person doesn\'t mind that I filched his
data. I didn\'t see the point of starting from scratch, retyping all the
tables and re-inventing the wheel. If that person is reading this, drop
me a line, and I\'ll give credit where credit is due.

Hey this is way cool! Where\'s your QSDS design workbook!?!?
Patience, O Traveller. I want to get this one nice \'n shiny before
working on that (which I anticipate will actually be easier). Besides,
with wildstar working on QSDS v.2.0, why don\'t I wait for that?

This is one topic I\'d like to see hashed out it a future IG release.
I\'m not asking for answers, just a nice list of examples (possibly put
forward by referees on TML).

Another topic that sometimes comes up is extremely high-population
planets that shouldn\'t be able to exist under certain circumstances
(low tech-vacuum worlds, low land-to-hydrosphere ratio, etc.).  Again,
I am not looking for hard answers, just a list of good examples.

High Guard Refueling Tactics.

During our playing sessions, the PCs developed a squadron tactic to
defend against low lying or dirt side SDBs and star side SDBs.  Yes,
these became known as Low Guard (a corollary to HG) and 
High Guard in the CT parlance.  IB the US Army uses the term 
"over watch" in regards to tactical tank movements and 
"bounding overwatch" in regards to infantry tactics.

This is what happens when you play with pilots, navigators coneheads 
and combat planners.

I think you\'ve solved  the possible scenarios from a refueling aspect.

Sources of High Guard activity:   L4/L5 points (Greek and Trojan Belts),
nearby moons, nearby asteroid belts, and nearby planets in occlusion.

Sources of Low Guard activity:  dirt side oceans, mountains, ice caps of
standard planets.  Low lying SDBs within gas giants --  but I have always
had trouble with this one since I felt that the SBD/starship sensors would
be blinded by ion storms.

But what if I\'m a professional listening to a lecture on, say, new
technology, ways of doings things, new theories, what have you, the sort
of thing likely to spark lots of independent ideas in my own head?  Unless
we\'re postulating telephathic computers, it\'s _not_ going to pick up on
those, and I will darn well want to strike while the iron is hot and get
those ideas down in some sort of permanent form for later review.  I don\'t
want to have to say them, lest I distract others (or allow them to steal
my concepts!), and, again, I don\'t want to use my own respiratory tract
lest I interfere with my own listening.  So how do I note down my
inspirations? >>

You have an electronic notepad, say A5 size, maybe 5mm thick. Might fold 
up smaller. As the lecturer talks, it hears the speech and displays it in 
real time. You want to add notes? Simply write them in the margin, same as 
people have done for 100s of years.

Oh! Geez. Well, OK, that makes more sense, but, just to check,
the copy of SSDS I have says:

Once the weapon is converted to USD values, multiply the USD values by the 
number of weapons in the battery. Add a Rate of Fire modifier as follows: 
If the weapon has a Rate of Fire less than 100, no modifier. For
ROF of 100, +1; for ROF of 200, +2; for ROF of 400, +3; for ROF of 800, +4. 
Note that the ROF bonus cannot be greater than the battery\'s current damage 
rating (i.e. a weapon that converts to 2-0-0-0, with a ROF of 800,
only gets a +2 bonus at short range and no bonus beyond that: 4-0-0-0).

which is, I suppose, wrong. Grumph.

Well, Actually, you have to differentiate between being heterosexual (or
bisexual) and committing an heterosexual act (or, in the case of 20th
century western culture, putting on a heterosexual act).  Many people who
are not \'het\' experiment sexually, particularly when they are young.

Seriously, there is a large hidden gay population in the United States
(as an example).  Many folks who grew up in a time and place (like now,
here) where a particular behavior was viewed as unacceptable,
contemptable, disgusting and/or immoral found ways of hiding that behavior
from others.

We in this country have failed to make the facts sexual orientation
acceptable in the culture at large in general as evidenced by the Defense
of Marriage Act.

In The Imperium each world will have its own prejudices which may be
similar or opposite or just different from our own.  Encounters in the
cosmopolitan spaceports, however, might be with same sex partners or
opposite sex partners, or perhaps non-humans (or humans!) with a
completely different sexuality alltogether!  It is clear, however, that
local culture will make a judgement about what is acceptable sexually.

My wife and I once attended a March on Washington for Homosexual rights,
it was a context where we both felt rather uncomfortable expressing our
heterosexuality in public, so we "closeted" that part of ourselves. A very
interesting experiment, glad I don\'t have to live like that.

Experiment - something is treated as "right" to the extent that it does not
break existing data, and that it makes useful predictions about new data.
A key part of this is that data is considered important.  To the extent
that the process allows experimentation to even theoretically judge the
results of the theory, it is science, and allows the scientific method.

This is why Aristotle was taught about as an important precursor to the
modern scientist in my history of science class, but the instructor made a
point about him not being a scientist in the present sense.  Aristotle
believed that observation was inferior to insight, and thus that the answer
which was theoretically superior was the better answer.  I was not terribly
fond of his philosophy, but that is an area where there is little
observational data, and so whether they are correct or not is not really a
matter for scientific inquiry at this time.

When you can measure ethics, then we might see a scientific theory of it.

[England - white swans.  Australia - black swans.]
>Law broken.

Nope.  Law refined to cover a larger domain.  If you were doing science,
you would have included on some level where the observations took place.
You might not have stated all such preconditions explicitly in the original
discussion, but anyone looking would realize where the observations
happened.  Further, what is an unstated assumption is cultural, but the
existence of it and its ability to be challenged by new data is part of
what is presently called the scientific method.

The stated theory becomes "all English swans are white."

>That above example about the swans is a real life one.

I believe that might be a straw man argument. Finding a black swan in
Australia does not suddenly add any to the previous area of observation in
England, which is what your original argument implied.  This is a sign that
the problem domain was expanded overmuch.

"Science" can not be wrong as long as the data has been carefully
evaluated, but a given theory can give incorrect results.  (I am assuming a
reality-driven world view.  If your metaphysics says that the world is an
illusion, then you may bow out of the discussion of science now.  I have my
own personal metaphysics, but metaphysics is a domain where physics need
not apply.)

A scientific theory that is giving bad predictions can be based on bad
data, which is caught by good data.  It can be applied to domains where it
does not apply, which will produce bad results, but the concept is not
"wrong", and you should really use the previous data in formulating a new
theory which simplifies to something like the old theory when observing
previous domains.

Even if you think you are in such a domain, you had best be careful before
ruling out science as "wrong."

For example, we know fairly well how light is focused.  No possible
technology is going to come along and change that without having wide
reaching effects.  If you want to propose one, go ahead.  Traveller did
with gravitic focusing.  It means that traveller sensors become much more
interesting, and one has to ask whether gravitic focusing can be detected,
and how this impacts other sensors.

Active sensors become much more feasible at long range if you can
arbitrarily drop a factor of r out of a bunch of equations.

So, you are left with believing that what we now know is correct to the
extent of our instruments, and thus proposing any new ideas along with at
least an implicit statement about what kind of data might have shown the
error of our current theory.  If you want to add antigravity, think about
why we have not seen evidence of it so far, and make that part of the
statement.

T\'aint for no reason.  Your posts do often use nonstandard definitions.  A
few of these are expected, and will be picked up from context.  Enough of
them, and you get a large number of flames, and a bunch of waste heat
because people do not know what you are talking about.  The solution is
simple - figure out what it is about the posts that generate high heat, and
decide either to alter that, or live with the results.

As long as you are going to make stabs about Shakespearean scholars,
combined with an aggressive high heat argumentation style, you are going to
get contempt.  About half of my senior year physics class was in a
production of Macbeth at HMC, and a number of them considered themselves
Shakespearean scholars of a kind.

Do it.  You are taking up our time to read what you say.  If it is worth
taking our time to read, then it is worth taking your time to read it over
and perhaps spell check it.  Read it two or three times, and perhaps even
read it again an hour after you write it before sending it.  You might be
surprised at how much better the text becomes after the second draft.

This does not mean that spelling flames are a great idea, merely that it is
worth spending a few moments so that disagreements are going to be over
what you meant, not what you said.

I would say bisexual, not homosexual or else there would have been no 
more of them. 

 Similarly, in the
19th century navy and merchant marine male homosexuality was quite 
common.

I\'d say this has more to do with being at sea more than on land.  There 
were, of course, no women on those ships.  This was much like a prison 
situation and more a way to escape your raging hormones than being 
homosexual.

An interesting point.  I\'ve had a lesbian couple in my game which had 
children in the same fashion.  With the many worlds of the Imperium ( and 
no doubt the Solomani as well ) there has to be a world somewhere where 
this is the fashion.  Could lead to some interesting problems for 
homophobic PC\'s to be on a planet which demands homosexuality of them 
much as many of our societies have demanded heterosexuality.

  When naming a _class_ of Q-ships, one uses the Q-name of the

  class, and the same type code as the simulated class prefixed
  by "Q". So, a Q-Ship emulating the Empress Marava class A2 Far

  Vice Squad (Empress Marava) class Anti-Piracy Enforcer (QA2).

  Individual ships in the class would carry two names, one for
  the actual class and one for the simulated class.  While
  "running deep" (i.e., in simulation mode, to lure a pirate),
  they run the simulated class ID; when they "go live", they
  switch to the Q ID - so the Vice Squad would run deep as the
  Empress Marava, but would run the Vice Squad ID when it went

  Just what is startown like on various worlds - especially the
  pre-starflight-tech worlds?  What kind of unusual combinations
  of tech will one encounter (for example - in "Tunnel", one
  will find nuclear-powered railroad engines (on certain crack
  luxury trains, like the Flying Cornishman), but "Babbage
  (misspelled as "Brabbage") Engines" are still experimental -
  and thoroughly mechaniwockle, not electronic.  Cunard runs a
  brand new transatlantic aircraft that is reminiscent of its
  oceangoing steamships in terms of luxury (staterooms and
  salons, not just seats) - fueled by coal dust - but there are
  nuclear powered submarines.  The final cut between two
  sections of the Tunnel is made by laser - and the upper class
  travels through the streets of London in carriages with
  carriage drivers (as though they were horse drawn, though it\'s
  not clear whether they are or not))?  What kind of people will
  you encounter?  Is startown more like New York or Sanctuary?
  Or does it depend on how heavy the traffic is?

  Discussion?

Actually, I was looking for opinions on both, but I appreciate your pointing this out.
I\'d agree that diffierent cultures would view things differently, but how does the 
Imperial military feel about homosexuality or bisexuality?  Indeed, do they, as you put 
forth, care about it?

Understood.  Is it however different for the Solomani of "pure bred stock" ( for lack 
of a better term )?  Indeed is there such a thing.  Solomani/Aslan seems to hint that 
there are such things ( the Dootchen Estates ( South African Whites ), the Grand United 
States of Quesada ( Hispanics ), the New Slavic Solidarity, etc. ). Is this purely a 
cultural choice or do these Solomani states consist of peoples that are more true to 
their backgrounds?

However, how many other racist comments could the average human come up with against the 
K\'kree or the Vargr involved?  Are people making off-color jokes about the Vargr in the 
Imperium?  It would seem a culturally Imperial Vargr in the Imperium would face an 
uphill struggle against just the sort of racism we\'re discussing.

This sounds wonderful :)  Is there anything written up on this race?  I\'d love to see 
something on it.

Have a look at this, hot off the Reuters newsline:

HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - "Ringworld," the best-selling trilogy written and
created by sci-fi master Larry Niven, is being developed as a feature film
by Quincy
Jones\' production company.

QDE Entertainment, which the producer/composer runs with David Salzman,
bought the rights for undisclosed terms. They next will look for a writer
and director to
adapt and develop the project.

"Ringworld" is the story of a small group of both alien and human
adventurers who are hired to explore an artifact discovered deep in outer
space. The artifact is a
great ring, the size of the Earth\'s orbit around the sun, with an inner
surface more than 300 million times the size of earth. The adventurers set
out to discover what
kind of being could have built the outerworld.

"\'Ringworld\' has all the elements for an incredible action-packed feature
experience, great characters, a riveting story, and tremendous science
fiction action," said
Joel Simon, president of QDE Motion Pictures.

Plans are to establish a licensing and merchandising program for the
project and its characters. The characters also appear in other Niven
books. The "Ringworld"
trilogy has more than 7 million copies in print.

Anything below 1000 tons is a "boat" in modern terms.  At most

I don\'t see the problem with having high tech systems next to low 
tech systems.

I mean, we\'re talking about solar systems here, and a parsec is a 
long way away even given the technology and drives in Traveller.

Communicators can\'t reach that far on any practical level, and in a 
lot of cases, the next parsec might as well be on the other side of 
the Imperium.

We see this type of dichotomy in a lot of real life areas on 
even much smaller scales.

Take the US and Mexico, for instance--two countries, vastly different 
tech levels, and they sit right next to each other on the same 
contintent.

States here in the US are like that too.  Texas is pretty prosperous, 
as states go, but it borders two of the poorest states in the 
country--Louisiana and Arkansas.

Or, how about cities that are close to each other.  Take Houston and 
Galveston, for instance, or Houston and Baytown--we\'re talking two 
different worlds.

I bet that you can even pick out a section in your city that is like 
this.

Here in Houston, one of the richest parts is River Oaks.  That\'s 
one of the places where the money is here in town.  If you saw Terms 
of Endearment, or the recent sequel, The Evening Star, you\'ll see 
some of it.

But if you go four blocks away from River Oaks, you\'ll run into one 
of the oldest and poorest sections of Houston--the Fifth Ward.

If you keep looking, you can continue to see more examples like 
this, and, citing this,  I don\'t think it is strange at all to have 
a very high TL star system right next door to a very low TL star 
system.

        You are right, SSDS does say (b), however it is wrong. Wildstar, in 
one of his Traveller Answers corrected it, saying that method (a) should be 
used. He also added in some corrections for the rate of fire modifiers for 
lasers etc.
     
        This is on my SSDS errata page 
[http://www.spirit.net.au/_jamesd/Trav/SSDS/Eratta.html with a tilde before the 
jamesd], however, the new ROF modifiers (-1 for ROF 10) isn\'t there. SSDSCalc 
also calculates weapon ratings using the corrected method, so Roderick\'s laser 
array is correct.

procedure provided by James Dempsey at his web site:
1) Multiply the listed weapon damage by the number of weapons [in the

2) Convert the damage value to a USP rating
3) Add in any rate of fire bonus, remembering not to add in more than the
existing value

For an SSDS TL12 251 Mj laser, the damages at the four ranges is: 40, 33,
17, and 8. (For the ROF of 10 there are no bonuses.)
A single laser turret would have a USP of   /2-1-0-0 .
A battery with ten of these lasers would have damage values of: 400, 330,
170, and 80. (Still no ROF bonuses.)
The battery would have a USP of  /9-8-5-3 .

Adding the damage values of the lasers makes sense. Adding the USPs (which
are logarithmic), overrates the short range effects and minimizes the long
range effects.

Hope this helps or at least explains what I did. It makes more sense than
the Starships instructions.

This is a good point, and it did occur to me, but I thought it would be
boring.  Not having the honour of living during the first Imperium I could
only compare the Vilani to the Solomani and assumed that at some point in
there history when they were a little more dynamic that they did name
there sea ships and continued this tradition into space.

Also, if we take your assumption, then why did they name there worlds?
With such a vast Empire why didnt they just use numbers/letters like
LV4226?  Im basing this on the names in the upper part of the Solomani Rim
which (some) are definetly not of Terran Origin.

I agree, I never said that I was for or against homosexual lifestyle. I
wouldn\'t bother me a bit if he was gay or bi, but because a person didn\'t
marry and had strong feelings toward another person of the same sex is
automatically assumed to be gay bothers me.   It also bothers me that someone
would say that because one\'s father or mother is gay that it is a damn good
chance that the child will turn out to be gay.  How many of those gay twins
had gay parents?  Bet you won\'t find a significant correlation there.  Fact
is nobody knows why certain people turn out to be gay.

Interesting side note.  Recently I attended Norwescon 20 (the Pacific
Northwest SciFi convention) and the Science guest of honor was Dr.
Robert Forward (Larry Niven was GoH -- *drool*).  Dr. Forward ran a
panel on "Current Physics" that I attended.  Among the many topics that
were discussed was the fact that there are *no* laws of physics that
preclude the existance of negative matter. 

And then there are these giant \'voids\' in space.  Places where there are
few to no galaxies.  All of the bright matter in the universe (stars,
galaxies, clouds of hydrogen) are strung out along the edge of these
voids.  Now of course the mutual gravitational attraction of matter
could explain this peculiar pattern of clumping, however...

What if, along with all of the bright and dark positive matter, an equal
amount of negative matter.  Negative matter exerts a gravitational
repulsion on everything around it--pushing away the bright positive
matter and ends up clumping together, but not shining because it repels
even itself.  So, the voids between the clusters of galaxies are filled
with clouds of negative matter.

Wierd, eh?

   The survey probably said something to the effect that 90% of women
had fantasized about being with another woman.  This is not the same
thing as having bisexual leanings.  Many people fantasize about killing
their boss, but that doesn\'t make them prone to commit murder.

   I liked Sharon Stone\'s comment when asked if she were bisexual: "it
ain\'t got no zing if it ain\'t got that schwing."

   This also bring up another side discussion of "martial aid devices"
at TL 15, but I\'ll save that for later....

   So to speak....<G>

   Actually the overall Greek view of homosexual relationships was much
more tolerant than in the Judeo-Christian era.  In retrospect it might
appear that homosexual behavior was common place everywhere which it
certainly was not.  Indeed, for every two or three cities that tolerated
it, there was probably one using turnips as a form of punishment
(ouch!).  Generalizing about the Greek city-states is dangerous given
their diversity, but this is one of those areas where reputation is
based on more than myth.

	Also, why are we trying to shoehorn Traveller ship classifications into
the SIZES generally exhibited during a single period on Earth by WET NAVY
vessels, when those vessels themselves were classified based more on
FUNCTION than on size?

	I\'d rather define what the PURPOSE of a battleship is, then let its size
be a result of that. If you decide that a battleship is simply a 5,000Td
warship, I\'ll build a 50,000Td warship and kick its exhaust ports ...

By the same logic, you could just as authoritatively say that we have a
large hidden population of space aliens in the United States.  Despite
continued anecdotal claims like this, the last couple of methodologically
sound surveys have confirmed the 2-3% number (by comparison, about 12% is
black, and about 15% regularly uses the Internet).

Well, the _facts_ of sexual orientation are at best very poorly understood
by anyone from developmental neurologists to psychologists or sociologists.
 Various groups have deeply held _opinions_ but those may or may not be the
same as facts.

Whew, back on topic at last!  I think someone already brought up "The
Forever War."  A crew of hets going to a homosex or no-sex planet might
make for interesting role playing. :)

And then there is the Puppeteer notion of sex...

Which would measure the mass in tonnes (on earth anyway - would different 
world have different water displacements?)
Whereas the Displacement in liquid Hydrogen is purely a volume based 
measurement.  After all a ship must have some of itself above the water 
line or it becomes a submarine :)
I would expect a Close escort to actually mass in the region of 4000 tonnes 
(4,000,000 kg)

Such as

>I don\'t see the problem with having high tech systems next to low

and I agree completely.  I must also add that comment was what I was 
looking for.

Take the US and Mexico, for instance--two countries, vastly different
tech levels, and they sit right next to each other on the same
contintent.

But anything you can get in the states you can get in mexico - and you can 
probably have it serviced there as well.
However, could mexico manufacture all the stuff the US can make. hmmmmmm 
maybe, maybe not.

If you keep looking, you can continue to see more examples like
this, and, citing this,  I don\'t think it is strange at all to have
a very high TL star system right next door to a very low TL star
system.

I agree the random factor makes for much more interesting environments to 
game in.  But, I also think that the Tech Level is presented incorrectly in 
the game.  It is mostly used as a what-is-available-here sort of measure. 
 I feel it should really be a what-can-be-made-here sort of thing and that 
some guidelines for bleed through of technology should be developed.

For example although Sorel has a TL1 rating the nearness of a TL15 POP10 
world such as glisten would tend to mean that most prosperous Soreleans 
would have high tech gizmo\'s (Glisten would almost have to be a net 
exporter).  Whereas a more distant, higher TL world mayy not have the 
degree of gizmoisation simply because of distance.

I subscribe to this mailing list so I can read stuff about TRAVELLER,
stuff like Powered Battle Armor, fusion rifles, Imperial politics,
reviews of Traveller items, Traveller news, grav tanks and such.  I
don\'t really care  much one way or the other about Gays in the Imperium,
and I\'d wager most Traveller players don\'t care much either.

I am not posting this to be argumentative nor do I wish to offend
anyone, but I subscribe to this mailing list because I want to hear
about a little sci-fi role-playing game named Traveller, stop wasting

Also, why are we trying to shoehorn Traveller ship classifications into
the SIZES generally exhibited during a single period on Earth by WET NAVY
vessels, when those vessels themselves were classified based more on
FUNCTION than on size?

Sadly due to the design style of Ships in Traveller it is not possible to 
have a real Cruiser because range is almost always restricted to one 
Maximum Jump :(


I\'d rather define what the PURPOSE of a battleship is, then let its size
be a result of that. If you decide that a battleship is simply a 5,000Td
warship, I\'ll build a 50,000Td warship and kick its exhaust ports ...

How about someting like this (and hopefully I will not restart the Fighters 
thread - Sheeeesh...)

Fighters - Very Small (< 100tons) - very fast, incapable of Jump - area 
denial, supression, fleet security and missile launchers

System Defense Boats - Of any size but generally small (100-1000 tons) - 
fast, incapable of jump - area denial, patrol, defense, stealth and hiding 
to attack those pesky refueling vessels

Corvettes - Small patrol vessels - maybe jump capable (Workhorse of the 
fleet sort of thing) used for duties ranging from Fighter to System Defence 
Boats to Destroyer Roles and many others besides.

Destroyers - medium (1000 - 10,000t) - quite fast but designed to harrass 
enemy shipping, area denial, and operate solo (or in packs ) with out a 
fleet also perform escort duties

Frigates - Medium (100-10,000t) - like a detroyer by more suited to a fleet 
based role - such as anti fighter, antomissile, Aegis type operations

Cruisers - Any ship can be a cruiser(if they have extra range or duration)

Cruiser - the ship class (rather than the type) - Large ( 10000-100000t), 
well armoured - well armed - good range - Ship of the line stuff - carries 
all kinds of good stuff (drop troops - fighters etc... in large enough 
quanities to be useful)

Battlecruiser - (100000- 200000t) Armed or armoured like a battleship but 
lighter and faster with better range otherwise like a cruiser.

Battleship - The big baby(100000-400000t) - Very heavily Armoured and Armed 
- - adequate range and speed - Not many of these in your fleet.

Battlestar (Space opera helped here) - A _VERY_ big Battleship (400000t +)

Other ship types include the Tender, carriers, assualt landers etc.., but 
most of these are essentially non combatants and tend to be the size 
required (or allowed - pesky polititians)

Remember that a fleet that is not designed for War will Lose, but a fleet 
that is not designed for Peace will never be built.

One of the things I don\'t like about the Traveller space combat 
systems is that the combat turns are too long.  You only get one shot 
at an enemy per battery in 10 minutes?

That seems a little long to me.

My question is this--

If I shorten the time/distance scales, how long does it take a ship\'s 
laser to recharge before it can fire again.

Is this instantaneous?  6 seconds?  10 minutes?  What?

Also, what about max range.  I can figure range for lasers based on 
Mayday, Baisic CT rules, and Brilliant Lances, but this comes out to 
about 2.5 to 3 million kilometers.  Can this be right?

Or, is it that range for starship lasers is not what limits you--its 
the sensor range?  

Sensor range always works out shorter than a laser\'s max range.

Without sensors, can you even fire at a target?  Do you have to have 
a sensor lock in order to fire?

I noticed in Mayday that there is a rule for manual control--so that 
you can use your lasers without the computer.  Does this imply that a 
sensor lock is not needed to fire at a target?

My ultimate goal here is to do one of two things--

1)  Either shorten the distance and time scales for space combat so 
that a ship fires more often given the time scale, but only gets one 
fire attempt per battery per combat round

2) Or the ship uses the printed time and distance scales, but the 
ships are allowed to fire at each other more often.

This is really an offical question, but I\'d like input from any 
others who wish to give it.

For my game, I\'m breaking new ground here.

Perhaps because we are creatures of habit and tradition and that we would
probably carry the same ideas for a wet navy to a space navy.

	In Classical Rome, men were not "expected" to be gay.  In
Classical Greece, it was more common and unofficially condoned.  People
were still killed in ancient Greece for being gay.

	There are many societies (some tribes in New Zealand, and several
S. Pacific Islands) were male homosexuality is not only expected, it is
encouraged.  This extends to hunting groups and male
socializations. Marriage and children are also expected.

	A lot more has been written about
male homosexuality in anthropological literature due to limitations of the
past as well as the fact that most anthropologists were male until
recently (and thus participant observation into female spheres is
difficult).  Also, there is a stigma on publications dealing exclusively
with these topics.

	You bet.

	(How the heck did this topic start up?)

	Later!

I see TL as being the level that the world could maintain if cut off from
interstellar contact.  A world may import higher TL gear, but it\'s the
ability to manufacture and repair that counts.

Exactly.  We see TL as being that which the world is capable of utilizing 
on it own.  Other High tech Items or facilities may be present but these 
rely solely on external support and as such cost exorbitent sums (all in 
Imperial Credits of Course).

Don\'t be too sure about technology trickling down from high tech worlds..
Here on Earth there are still areas operating at TL2-3, while we chat away
on our TL8 computer networks.  Cultural attitudes, legal restrictions, lack
of resources, all these can lead to a world lagging behind in TL.

Worlds would lag behind and they do as shown on any map of the imperium 
showing Tech Level.  However, all worlds would have some Tech from all 
levels. The ratio for each Tech Level would be related to the distance from 
the source world of that technology.

Vilani settled/influenced worlds, with their attitude towards the ownership
of technology, are not going to be that quick to advance; it\'s simply
against what they know is right.

While some cultural aspects to technology exchange may hinder advances I 
would hope that in most cases the science behind the technology is easily 
available.  The concept I\'m trying here is that most Science is readily 
accessible and that  if you had enough money and resources you could just 
start a TL15 society on an empty world and baring any calamity it could be 
self sufficient.  This is implied in the World Builders Handbook which 
details Colony design and stuff.  This would mean that any world could 
quite readily change to any tech level given the resources.  These are most 
likely beyond the reach of all worlds - but also implies that many difering 
tech levels could exist of the same world - I would supect that the single 
UWP is becoming a millstone around the neck of world designers and that 
very few worlds are made up of single world spanning government (but as the 
average population is in the Hundreds of Thousands perhaps they are WSG). 
 Hmm I\'m a bit off track here but I hope you can see my point.

Rather than universities, the big agent of change in the Imperium is going
to be the Navy and Marines.  Imagine a farm kid from a TL4 world joins the
Marines.  He sees and learns to use equpment that is one step removed from
magic, and sees how easy life is with these tools.  After four years, he
returns home, and starts improving things on the family farm using
techniques he learned in the INMF.  Enough of these vets, and you\'ll see a
slow, steady rise in TL.

hmmmmm - Could you go home again after all that exposure to the real 
Imperium.  Why not settle on a nice world?  But then again why not return 
home?

Exactly.  We see TL as being that which the world is capable of utilizing 
on it own.  Other High tech Items or facilities may be present but these 
rely solely on external support and as such cost exorbitent sums (all in 
Imperial Credits of Course).

Worlds would lag behind and they do as shown on any map of the imperium 
showing Tech Level.  However, all worlds would have some Tech from all 
levels. The ratio for each Tech Level would be related to the distance from 
the source world of that technology.

While some cultural aspects to technology exchange may hinder advances I 
would hope that in most cases the science behind the technology is easily 
available.  The concept I\'m trying here is that most Science is readily 
accessible and that  if you had enough money and resources you could just 
start a TL15 society on an empty world and baring any calamity it could be 
self sufficient.  This is implied in the World Builders Handbook which 
details Colony design and stuff.  This would mean that any world could 
quite readily change to any tech level given the resources.  These are most 
likely beyond the reach of all worlds - but also implies that many difering 
tech levels could exist of the same world - I would supect that the single 
UWP is becoming a millstone around the neck of world designers and that 
very few worlds are made up of single world spanning government (but as the 
average population is in the Hundreds of Thousands perhaps they are WSG). 
 Hmm I\'m a bit off track here but I hope you can see my point.

hmmmmm - Could you go home again after all that exposure to the real 
Imperium.  Why not settle on a nice world?  But then again why not return 
home?

Which would measure the mass in tonnes (on earth anyway - would different 
world have different water displacements?)
Whereas the Displacement in liquid Hydrogen is purely a volume based 
measurement.  After all a ship must have some of itself above the water 
line or it becomes a submarine :)
I would expect a Close escort to actually mass in the region of 4000 tonnes

Sadly due to the design style of Ships in Traveller it is not possible to 
have a real Cruiser because range is almost always restricted to one

How about someting like this (and hopefully I will not restart the Fighters 
thread - Sheeeesh...)

Fighters - Very Small (< 100tons) - very fast, incapable of Jump - area 
denial, supression, fleet security and missile launchers

System Defense Boats - Of any size but generally small (100-1000 tons) - 
fast, incapable of jump - area denial, patrol, defense, stealth and hiding 
to attack those pesky refueling vessels

Corvettes - Small patrol vessels - maybe jump capable (Workhorse of the 
fleet sort of thing) used for duties ranging from Fighter to System Defence 
Boats to Destroyer Roles and many others besides.

Destroyers - medium (1000 - 10,000t) - quite fast but designed to harrass 
enemy shipping, area denial, and operate solo (or in packs ) with out a 
fleet also perform escort duties

Frigates - Medium (100-10,000t) - like a detroyer by more suited to a fleet 
based role - such as anti fighter, antomissile, Aegis type operations

Cruisers - Any ship can be a cruiser(if they have extra range or duration)

Cruiser - the ship class (rather than the type) - Large ( 10000-100000t), 
well armoured - well armed - good range - Ship of the line stuff - carries 
all kinds of good stuff (drop troops - fighters etc... in large enough 
quanities to be useful)

Battlecruiser - (100000- 200000t) Armed or armoured like a battleship but 
lighter and faster with better range otherwise like a cruiser.

Battleship - The big baby(100000-400000t) - Very heavily Armoured and Armed 
- - adequate range and speed - Not many of these in your fleet.

Battlestar (Space opera helped here) - A _VERY_ big Battleship (400000t +)

Other ship types include the Tender, carriers, assualt landers etc.., but 
most of these are essentially non combatants and tend to be the size 
required (or allowed - pesky polititians)

Remember that a fleet that is not designed for War will Lose, but a fleet 
that is not designed for Peace will never be built.

Kenneth Beardon brought up some good points about strange TL combinations 
of worlds next to each other.

Such as

>I don\'t see the problem with having high tech systems next to low
>tech systems.

and I agree completely.  I must also add that comment was what I was 
looking for.

Take the US and Mexico, for instance--two countries, vastly different
tech levels, and they sit right next to each other on the same
contintent.

But anything you can get in the states you can get in mexico - and you can 
probably have it serviced there as well.
However, could mexico manufacture all the stuff the US can make. hmmmmmm 
maybe, maybe not.

If you keep looking, you can continue to see more examples like
this, and, citing this,  I don\'t think it is strange at all to have
a very high TL star system right next door to a very low TL star
system.

I agree the random factor makes for much more interesting environments to 
game in.  But, I also think that the Tech Level is presented incorrectly in 
the game.  It is mostly used as a what-is-available-here sort of measure. 
 I feel it should really be a what-can-be-made-here sort of thing and that 
some guidelines for bleed through of technology should be developed.

For example although Sorel has a TL1 rating the nearness of a TL15 POP10 
world such as glisten would tend to mean that most prosperous Soreleans 
would have high tech gizmo\'s (Glisten would almost have to be a net 
exporter).  Whereas a more distant, higher TL world mayy not have the 
degree of gizmoisation simply because of distance.

	Traveller has a rich background, which lends itself for discussion
concerning politics, social issues, xenology, and technology accross
several thousand years and thousands of systems/cultures.  The topic of
sexuality is interesting, and certainly should generate *some* discussion
as this would be an important social facet of both human and alien
cultures.

	It is nice to see other topics addressed rather than grav tanks,
gauss weapons, product reviews, fushion rifles, and the other bland tech
toys.

	If you are uncomfortable with a topic or feel bored by it, don\'t
read it and skip it.  This list should be able to accomodate both the
gadget freaks and the culture nuts.  I, for one, would love to see a
discussion on ethnomedical beliefs and practices among some of the races.
Now THAT would bore some people...

	For me, the Traveller appeal was its background, which draws from
a lot of "classic" SF sources, and lends itself to richer development.  I
don\'t play Star Wars or other space opera-like games for that reason
(although they do make fun one-offs).

	I would also love to see a discussion on the best/worst of the old
Traveller supps. and magazines.  There was some really great source
material out there 12+ years ago.

	Laterish!

If you were around for the Great Task System thread about a month ago you
would have seen a lot of different task systems proposed. I actually tried
out several of them; most were so broken they were obviously proposed
completely off the cuff and with no playtesting whatsoever. Frankly, I feel
the published T4 system falls into that category as well...

However, there were two systems that did work well in playtest, and were
fairly simple to implement. One was KBv1.1 (which eventually became
KBv2.0), and the other was one based on MegaTraveller. In that system (the
author of which I forget) you rolled 2 dice against a target number
specified by the task difficulty (I can\'t remember the exact numbers, it
was something like easy = 4+, average = 7+, difficult = 10+, and so on).
Skills and "attribute modifiers" were DMs, where an attribute modifier was
from a table. I can\'t remember the table exactly, but an attribute of 1
giving a modifier of -2, 2 to 5 giving -1, 6 to 8 giving 0, and so on seems
familiar.

While this system gave good results, I did not like it as much as KBv1.1
(and I like KBv2.0 much more than KBv1.1). I didn\'t understand where the
target numbers came from, it had this annoying and arbitrary table you had
to look attributes up with, and it meant that attributes of 6 and 8 had the
same effect on tasks. On the plus side, "DM" always meant "dice modifier"
with this system, positive DMs were always good, and you always rolled 2
dice.

You can give this system a try, but I gave up on it. KBv2.0 survived a
pretty ruthless evolutionary battle between task systems because, in my
experience, it was the best one.

	Yes, but even wet navies redefine their ships based on purpose, without
being too straitjacketed by habit and tradition. Look at the evolution of
the battleship over the first half of the century, the birth of
"battlecruisers," "destroyers," etc...

	Part of a science fiction ROLE PLAYING game is the interaction among
people, which is affected by the society. So discussions about how people
behave in a society are indeed relevant to the game. If you don\'t want to
waste your time, don\'t bother reading.

If you don\'t like it then don\'t read those posts.

I am not offended that you\'re not interested, but I am mildly perturbed
that you want us to stop talking about it (and I think this thread was
starting to die down a bit anyway).

I understand what you are saying but I happen to think that these posts
are more ineresting than the nigh unending argument going on a week or
to ago about fighters & the posts tend to be a _lot_ shorter too.

I\'m also somewhat confused by your comment that you are interested in
Imperial politics but don\'t wan\'t to hear about the position of gays in
the Imperium.  Gays in the Imperium _is_ a policial discussion (as well
as a social one) and we got into this discussion by commenting on the
underlying subtexual evidence, in cannonical Traveller material, that
Archduke Norris seemed to be gay. The fact that the ruler of an area
(the Regency) choose not to marry (& thus enter into a political
alliance) is about the most political question there is.

May I respectfully suggest that those of you who are unwilling to accept
the evidence that Norris was gay be willing to consider the possibility
that there are those of us out there who know a _lot_ more on this
subject than you do and are more likely to notice this sort of thing. 
Norris set off my gaydar before I even knew what the term meant.

To me Traveller has always been about an optimistic future and one of
the things that made it optimistic was the Third Imperiums lack of
discrimination. When I bought my 3 little black books in 1978 at the age
of 12 one of the first things I noticed was a message of toleration of
diversity "Nowhere in these rules is a specific requirement established
that any charecter (player or non-player) be of a specific gender or
race.  Any charecter is potentially of any race or of either sex " -
Classic Traveller 1st Ed Book 1 pg 8

I think that this toleration must extend to sexual orientation.  While I
am revulsed by the Third Imperiums toleration of the brutality & murder
found on many of its extreme law level worlds I revel in the toleration
it offers.

"very fast"  Again, ditch this notation as it makes no sense at all.

Better: 

Fighters - Very Small, lightly armored, no jump, missions as you suggest.

Again, fast is a non-term.  Other than that, add "better armor" to
fighters above, and keep the missions.

Once again, in traveller "fast could only mean "high jump number" or
something.  Otherwise OK.

Hmmm.  US usage has frigates under destroyers, though they flip them
on the other side of the pond as I remember :-)

Traveller has historically described a Cruiser this way:

Capable of meeting ships of the line, but will always lose to a BB
(more or less).

Yeah.

See above harping about "fast." :-)

There are different "levels" of infinity, but the two examples you give
are at the same level, called Aleph-1.  Aleph-0 is the infinity of
integers, Aleph-1 the infinity of real numbers, and Aleph-2 the
infinity of curves in N-space for finite N > 1.

To show that two infinities are the same \'size\' you need to show that a
one-to-one mapping can be established between them; conversely, showing
such a mapping can\'t be established proves you have different-sized
infinities.

For example, in your case let the set of real numbers (and hence points)
in the interval [4, 6].  Now, we\'ll represent this as 4 + 2n for some
unique real number n in the interval [0,1].  Now, map this to 1 + n in the
smaller interval [1,2].  For every point in [4,6], we\'ve now specified how
to map to a unique point in [1,2], and we can reverse this to map the
opposite way.  Having established a one-to-one mapping, we may conclude
that both infinities are the same \'size\' or \'level.\'

Showing that the infinity of reals is "bigger" than the infinity of
integers takes a bit more work...I can show the trick if anyone cares.

I guess I missed the original post.

> Lets look at some ratios.

Just be careful to use the same kind of *tons* in your comparisons. The
Traveller dt is 14 cubic meters.  OTOH, the tonnage of earthly sea-ships is
measured in several different ways.  The US standard ship ton is 100cubic
feet, approximately 1/5th of a Traveller dt, and the numbers you\'re quoting
below look like standard ship tons.

> CT Close Escort  400dT	WWII  CE  1250 - 3000 dT   (2200dT median)

    400dt * 5 = 2,000 ship tons  (approximately the same)
    
> CT Merc Cruiser  800dt	WWII  CR   6500 - 15K dT  (11K dT  median)

    800dt * 5 = 4,000 ship tons (a light cruiser)

    2,000dt * 5 = 10,000 ship tons (a reasonablly sized cruiser)

> CT BB/BR  50K dt?	WWII  BB  35K - 70K dT  (53K dT median)

    Here\'s where Traveller goes to ships *much* larger than your
    historic model.

    50,000dt * 5 = 250,000 ship tons!  (much larger!)
    
    and BB\'s in Traveller often exceed 100kdt!  
    
> Do we create a BB/BR closer to the CT Escort or Merc Cruiser ratios or

Frankly, I\'d prefer bringing the BC\'s, BB\'s, and BR\'s down a couple of
notches rather than pushing the smaller ships up.

5000dt is a little light for the biggest ships, but there\'s a large gap
between 2kdt and 50kdt.  Here are some suggested volumes for several
classes of Civilian and Military ships that I wrote up a while back.  These
are the guidelines I use when designing hulls for my campaign\'s.  I\'ve used
them twice in the past and will again for the game I\'m preparing for this
summer.

Some Civilian Ship Classes (approximations)

    Class               Cubic Meters     Traveller Tons
    ====================================================
    Courier             1,000 - 2,000       70 - 140
    Yacht               2,000 - 4,000       140 - 300
    Small Merchant      3,000 - 9,000       200 - 650
    Liner/Med Merchant  8,000 - 70,000      600 - 5,000
    Large Merchant      60,000 - 700,000    4,000 - 50,000
    
Some Military Ship Classes (approximations)

    Class               Cubic Meters            Traveller Tons
    ==========================================================
    Missile/Gunboat     1,000 - 2,000           70 - 140
    Scout               1,000 - 3,000           70 - 200
    Corvette            3,000 - 9,000           200 - 650
    Frigate/Escort      8,000 - 20,000          600 - 1,500
    Destroyer           15,000 - 40,000         1,100 - 3,000
    Cruiser             30,000 - 200,000        2,000 - 14,000
    Battleship          200,000 - 700,000       14,000 - 50,000
    Battlerider/Carrier 400,000 - 1,000,000     28,000 - 70,000
    Dreadnaught         700,000 - 1,400,000     50,000 - 100,000
    SuperDreadnaught    1,000,000 - 2,000,000   70,000 - 140,000
            
I\'d expect volumes for the bigger ships to be on the low end of the scale
for Milieu 0.  I also wouldn\'t expect very many Dreadnaughts or
SuperDreadnaughts to be in anybody\'s navy.  <G> In one game I had the PC\'s
as naval officers aboard a Frigate (~800dt) on detached duty performing
anti-piracy, diplomatic, and exploratory missions. In another, I have one
set of PC\'s on a Scout, another on a Small Merchant, and they will both
eventually end up trying to
salvage/repair an armed Medium Merchant that\'s on the bottom of a lake.  To
make matters worse the planet where the lake is located is deeply within
*enemy* space, so they\'ve got to get in undetected, repair the ship, and
and get it back over the border without getting killed or restarting the
recently ended war.

if the person is in a suspended state, I\'d think they still need the
protection.  I couldn\'t tell if that was included in your design.

Why should they care about it.  Given the cultural diversity of the
Third Imperium they probably gave up on worrying about such things a
long time ago as an impossible goal.  I would suspect thet the Imperial
military will have fairly rigid codes against PDA\'s or fraternization
but beyond that they won\'t care what you do off duty.

I have always assumed that the in the Second Empire the former Vilani
planets were ruled by a racially diverse lot as the Solomani were spread
fairly thinly as military governors.  On planets much closer to Earth
(ie the Solomani sphere) the  Solomani populations were much larger and
more racially homogeneous and that races were preserved here but were
not preserved on previuosly Vilani planets.

Yes they are.  In Eepithets For The Fifth Frontier War (JTAS #9 pg 27,
1981) Marc Miller wrote "Imperial references to the Vargr concentrate on
their perceived speech patterns, and include snarl, gral, and barkers. 
The most offensive epithet is a refeerence to Vargr origins in the
canines of Terra: doggie."

No the canonical references to the Darmine are very few.  I have
essentially made up a background for the Darmine based on my playing of
a charecter who was 1/2 Darmine and was culturally Darmine.  I have
never written it up a a _racial_ description but I may do so sometime.

Without going into "flavours" of rules, sancasters are purely defensive, 
but have the advantage of not needing power (thus allowing smaller, 
cheaper engines or more power for other things) while lasers can be used 
offensivly as well as defensivly.

Sandcasters are also quite a bit cheaper, although my experience of 
designing warships in High Guard has the engines as the big cost, and 
weaponary as the cheap bit.

I\'m not an expert, but I\'ll give it a shot.

Etheral propellers.  Space 1889, postulates that classic aether actually
exists and above the atmosphere can be be interacted with using propellers. 
The energy to turn the screws comes from solar-boilers, and these are
effective out to just beyond the asteroids, not quite to Jupiter.  Of
course, inventers can discover "atom power" and extend the ship range out
to the outer planets, if you let them.

In standard 1889 you don\'t.

Pretty much, yes.  Include the jungles and swamps of Venus, the caves of
the moon and you\'ve got the scope of the game.

The only other technological addition I recall is "liftwood."  A martian
wood that has a natural contra-gravity component..can only be grown on some
parts of mars.  

If you want to extend it to an interstellar scope, just add Jump Drive from
Traveller (or postulate that possible velocities exceed c once you get
beyond X distance from the sun) , and some sort of high-power lowish-tech
power source...I\'d choose water powered "cold fusion" for this game\'s feel.

Now, the various nations of earth can expand across the local stellar
neighborhood, and your players can explore along with the expansion.

OK, understood so far, which is why I was careful to stick with the
"ships\'s original rest frame" and "planet\'s original rest frame" in my
calculations.

*sigh* Something about doing all those calculations blew verbal clarity
right out of my head.  Yes, that\'s what I meant, so far as I can tell. :)

Most welcome, and thank you as well.  Now, if I might presume upon your
further indulgence...

(a) In a classical rocket, the vessel tosses mass out the back, and thus
moves forward thanks to momentum conservation. 

(b) In a thruster-propelled ship using the "push on the star" dodge, the
vessel shoves a large mass backward, and thus moves forward thanks to
momentum conservation. 

I thought I understood, but it\'s clear I don\'t:  Why does (b) violate
energy conservation, but not (a)?

Skill levels are used as DMs in several tasks (Like JoAT and Brawling). I
prefer writing the skill levels down over having to recalculate them every
time you use them.

A parsec away is *nothing*, considering that any starship has a
minimum of jump-1.  Any free trader can stop by, and according to the

I wouldn\'t say that US and Mexico are "vastly" different in regards to
tech levels (2, maybe 3 points away at best).  Just because they don\'t
launch their own satellites or have a nuclear capability doesn\'t make
them low tech.  They simply have better places to spend their limited
resources.  They are definitely a poorer country, and this does
contribute in some part to the country\'s perceived "tech level".

You do not subscribe to a mailing list just so that you can listen to
people discuss things that *you* what, you subscribe to a mailing list
so that you can listen to people discuss what *they* want.  If you
wish to begin a discussion about grav tanks or fusion rifles, start
one.  Do not try and tell others to cease discussing something that
you are NOT interested in just so that they can initiate a subject
that you ARE interested in.

Nope.  Your initial conclusion just wasn\'t specific enough.  If you
only searched one domain (ie: England), then your claim should have
read "all swans in *England* are white", or more precisely "all *Mute
Swans* (cygnus olor) in *England* are white".

Of course, if you happened to come across a Mute Swan in England that
is green with three eyes, you would be foolish (and incorrect) to
immediately disregard your claim.  Instead, science asks us to study
the green three-eyed Mute Swan more carefully to find out /why/ it
does not fit into your claim.  Perhaps it is a different species, or
maybe it has something to do with the nuclear powerplant that
travelled back from the future that is now located up stream :P

In either case, your original scientific claim is not *wrong*, it just
wasn\'t tightly defined enough.  Perhaps it should have read "all Mute
Swans (cygnus olor) in England *that do not live near a nuclear
powerplant that travelled back from the future* are white".

I think we are both right ... the Imperium doesnt mind all these 100t Scout/Couriers 
floating around, because they are pretty useless for piracy and so on - it just cant 
mount enough guns to be a threat to your average lightly-armed freighter.

On the other hand, a Q-ship would be a *lethal* pirate, and depending on it\'s armament 
it could be a threat to Naval Escorts of one type or another as well.

I think it is a "balance of risk" thing ... also, on the theme of Q-ships, why not refit 
the cargo bay into a fighter bay ... blow the doors off, and out fly a couple of Navy 
fighters ...

Actually, this mapping does not map all points on line uniquely to plane.

Remember, some real numbers do have do presentations. 0.999... (forever
nines) = 1.000... (forever zeroes). So every real number which ends in an
endless string of nines can be represented as a number ending in an
endless string of zeroes.

Proof? 

x = 0.999999....
10x = 9.99999...
10x - x = 9.000.... = 9x -> x = 1.0000....

Result : one point in 2-space is mapped onto two points in 3-space.
(0.1999999.. (2d) -> 0.19999.., 0.9999... (3d) and
 0.2000000.. (2d) -> 0.20000.., 0.0000... (3d) )
There are mappings which circumvent this problem, but alas, my teacher in
Helsinki University of Technology did not remember any of them when he
tried to map line onto plane.. B-)

Given the uproar with the Science debate (which I am partly resposable
:-(  ), I was thinking of designing steam or desil powered spaceships
(with wooden hulls).

Premise 1 to justify this : Metal poor world, what metals have to be
allocated to power generation and ship frames.

Premise 2: Wooden hulls over a mettal frame, with a rubber coating to
keep air in. (It has the armour value of a wet sponge, but there is a
tree in Australia called "Ironbark" which is very tough [axes bounce off
it]. if this culture has acccess to this type of wood, it would have
good strength [but still no real armour])

Premise 3 : Vacuume tube computers! (or babbage engines, I tend to go to
vacuume tubes, because they have more computing power than an old Model
1bis :-)

Lets see what happens.

What\'s the sample size here, 10, maybe 20?  How many folks like that can

It may be genetic (something I seriously doubt, humans are not hard-wired

this aren\'t a useful to answer the question. 

Bad statistics (and I\'ve seen a whole lot of these by social scientists

have produced a whole lot of dubious findings about human behavior in the
past few decades.  Genetics is vastly over-rated wrt human behavior.

The laser batteries do not fire just one shot during those 10 minutes.
Due to extremely long distances and the (relatively) small size of the
target one "shot" from a battery is in reality many shots spread around a
wide area, like a buck shot from a shotgun. 

Firing at Traveller space combat ranges is always a guessing game.
Consider, for example firing at a ship 4 light-seconds away (and thats
four hexes). First, the light (or any electromagnetic radiation) leaves
the enemy ship. Four seconds later, you detect this light and, thanks to
your TL27 fluid-optibiological computer, fire your lasers 0.02 picoseconds
later. The laser beams travel at the speed of light to the enemy vessel,
but this takes another four seconds. 
Let\'s say that the enemy vessel has speed of 5. This means it travels five
light-seconds in ten minutes. That is, ten thousand kilometers in the
eight seconds from seeing the ship somewhere and getting lasers back to
it. The enemy ship is not likely to be kilometers long (this is not Star
Wars) so it moves quite fast relative to its size.

So it is very hard to hit even if the range is so short. This is why the
lasers fire multiple shots.

(I think this was explained in FF&S)

	Yes... and, think about the following: In normal space, what we see can
usually be approximated by "continuum" situations... we think the matter is
sort of continuous, although each body is formed by a finite (although
large) number of atoms. So, the shape of normal (aleph-0) space resembles
something like aleph-1. What would Jspace-1 seem? Probably, something that
could be described as Aleph-2... the cardinal of the set curves... you see
some sort of mess with curving rays all around... and your mind cannot
really cope with it, you are an aleph-0 creature. If you view Jspace-n,
n>=2, you just cannot
understand the difference with Jspace-2.
	(Btw, just understanding all the implications of Jumpspace theory/

mathematician called Kantor went insane when discovering the theory, centuries
before the discovery of Jspace...)

	Ooops.. true. I did speak too fast. Change the above paragraph to:

	When starting jump, the lanthanum grid exponentially increases the
variance of meta-quantum situations in its particles (the particles of the
grid). In the limit, the grid cannot be contained in its space and so
"jumps" into the appropriate one, along with a bubble of normal space
containing the ship.

I would respectfully disagree.  In my campaign I never really considered
the position of Gays in the Imperium, it just never that important to
me.  But I must also admit I was not the kind of GM who emphasized
heterosexual encounters either.  Before it was mentioned on this mailing
list, I never even gave a thought that Norris was gay, when I was
reading about Norris I was always more interested in what his relations
with the Zhodani or Aslan were like.  Or his performance in the 5th
Frontier War.  That was the stuff I played Traveller for.

we\'re not covered in the Scholar Career. But, first, let\'s discuss the

 In _The Millennial Project_ by Marshall T. Savage, the weight/
 pressure/filtering trio was handled by using a double-walled
 shallow dome (almost flat) across craters, with 2.5 meters of
 water between the two membranes, with the outer membrane also
 gold-foil coated.  The water filters radiation, its weight
 balances out pressure forces leaving little strain on the dome
 material, and it can be circulated to help keep temperatures
 constant across the dome.  Most dwellings are built into the
 crater walls or are underground, as well, so that for the part
 of the day you\'re not "outside" you have additional shielding.

I think it\'s more of a "every ref has to handle it himself". 

I can see a wide range of possibilities. 

0. only licensed, different sex relationships are legal (some places
   are like this right now)
1. same sex relationships are *very* illegal as well as socially
   unacceptable. (lots of places in the world right now)
2. same sex relationships are illegal, but winked at (British upper
   class :-)
3. same sex relationships are legal, but frowned on (current state in
   even the most liberal parts of the world)
4. sex of partners is irrelevant (the hoped for state)
5. different sex relationships are legal but frowned on, except for
   reproduction (Ancient Greece)
6. different sex relationships are illegal, but winked at.
7. different sex relationships are illegal.
8. Only one sex is *allowed* (Bujold\'s "Ethan of Athos")

You know, flesh this out a bit, and it\'d make a good subsection under
law level!

You land on a level 8 world and only the women are allowed off the
ship. Or maybe only the men. The Vargr don\'t count under the local
laws. :-)

If anyone is *really* interested, it might be fun to work out some of
these "law-level breakdowns IG is afraid to tell you about"

Part of the trick is that you aren\'t storing anti-atoms, just
anti-protons. So the "electron cloud" in the crystal helps.

I\'ve got that. Trouble is, try determining which systems are within
distance X of where you are. You know that they are all within X hexes,
but not all systems within X hexes are within X distance. So you have
to check all of them. <yech>

Consider, if the thruster has to push against a planet or star, then
both the momentum and energy will balance, and should do so in all
frames. But power required goes up exponentially (literally) with
velocity, making them fairly useless except for specialized uses.

Remember, pushing on a star or planet gives an equal but opposite
reaction. It\'s just wasteful to keep accelerating the same mass. :-)

Also, consider that all these retired scouts provide excellent "cover"
for intel ops by scouts who are *not* actually retired, but instead are
working undercover. If they get into trouble, the IISS has "plausible
deniability". After all, consider what your players have done with
their ships. Could intel agents get into any worse trouble?

And to have *lots* of "free" intel, as well as cover for all *sorts* of
tricks. :-)

It started out as strictly handwaved. Then they started adding details.
I\'ll try to add details more or less in the order the game did.

You engage your jump drive, it eats a lot of fuel, very fast, and you
wind up in another space called jumpspace. A week later you pop out,
hopefully where you intended to. There\'s a maximum "jump" possible,
which depends on your drive.

They later decided that higher jump numbers required different
jumpspaces. And that the time of a jump varied.

Somewhere along the line they came up with the "jump bubble", a bubble
of normal space that is kept around the ship while it is in jump, to
protect it from jumpspace. Contacting the edge of the bubble is not
good for you. Supposedly, anything that hits the edge of the bubble
gets precipitated into normal space, one atom at a time. 

There are other variations dealing with things like the jump grid
"glowing" before jump entry and after jump exit. Not everyone agrees
about this "jump flash".

On the list we\'ve argued about possible details and explanations. Some
things *have* to happen simply to avoid messy physics problems, thus
the gravity wave at jump entry and exit. Others are attempts to explain
things like the "one week" duration in a way that "feels right". Best
bet on that one seems to be that the jump drive "charges" the jump grid
with some sort of energy, and you emerge from jumpspace when the charge
drops to a specific level. 

But jump drive is still mostly handwaving, and *I* would like to get a
bit more in the way of *details* about *what* it does, *how* can wait.
But there\'s *nothing* that says how accurately you can jump. That is,
how close in *space* you can come to where you aim. We do have figures
for time variance, and for misjump. <sigh>

ps. I try not to make typos, but they happen, often embarassingly. But
it *really* helps if you make sure that your sentences are coherent. If
they are, we can figure out the typos. But if the sentence structure is
gone, we can\'t figure out the typos *or* the sentence. Ok?

(100,200) maps to 120000. (1,2) maps to 12.

You can use *any* base. And the fact that the numbers stretch to
infinity is irrelevant. When "matching" infinities, all you need is a
*rule* that produces one-to-one mapping. It doesn\'t matter that it
would take an infinite amount of time.

No, he *doesn\'t* have to map it to the *same* point. He just has to map
to a *unique* point. The fact that they are different just shows that
there\'s more than one way to map 2D to 1D.

Currently these are the known infinities:

Aleph-null: the infinity of the whole numbers, also of the rational numbers
 Aleph-one: the infinity of the points in a line (or the irrational numbers,
            or the points in a plane, or in 3d space or 4d space, etc)
         C: the number of different curves that can be drawn on a plane

C *may* be Aleph-two, but all that is known is that it is bigger than
aleph-one, until they can prove that there isn\'t an infinity bigger
than aleph-one, but smaller than C.

Now what I mean by fast and very fast varies by role.  So really I guess it 
makes no sense.  I am fully aware of the limitations and operations of 
thrust based acceleration and it\'s relationship to velocity.

But what I mean by Fast is that for Spaceships they have a large 
acceleration rating - i.e. they can change velocity rapidily and so would 
be more likely to streak by slower accelerating ships and be better able to 
react and "Dodge" about in relation an arbitrary reference such as it\'s 
target.

For Starships by fast I mean able to jump to it\'s destination rapidly. 
 This is in relation to travelling large numbers of parsecs quite quickly. 
 i.e. J3,4,5 and 6.  A jump ship can be said to be fast if it is able to 
travel many parsecs quickly.  It also has the effect of being better able 
to travel in a straight line as it were because it does not have to use 
mains.

Hope this clarifies much of what I saif earlier.

No. Law revised to "All English swans are white. Australian Swans may
be black."

See? The old law still applies in the areas where it had been tested.
It only fails in *other* areas. So it turns out to be a "special case"
of a more general law.

We never said that science "can\'t be wrong". In fact, the whole
*thrust* of science is about trying to *dis*prove proposed theories. 

What we *are* saying is that IN THE AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN TESTED
theories are *not* going to be disproven. Just like your swans example,
discovery of black swans in Australia *doesn\'t* change the fact that
swans in England are white. The "laws" get *expanded*, not thrown out.

Science is "wrong" all the time. But it is wrong in certain *specific*
ways. Namely, the new discoveries *don\'t* invalidate the old
observations. Occasionally, in cases where its hard to observe things,
we find that there were mistakes in observations. But nobody is going
to find that gravity quits working under "normal" conditions. They may
find that the way it works under unusual conditions is different, but
that the difference is in the 6th decimal place under normal conditions.

Science is *not* a static process of "this is the way it is". It\'s a
dynamic process of "To the best of or knowledge, and under the
circumstances we\'ve tested, the universe works this way".

What we object to is *not* that our knowledge may turn out to be
incomplete. That goes with the territory. It\'s your idea that new
discoveries will substantially change the rules as they apply under
conditions where we\'ve already run tests. *That* is bullshit.

Excuse me, but *you* are the one coming across as self-righteous. And
you were "attacked" because you were doing a damn good job of avoiding
the issue every time someone called you on something. And that you are
quite willing to say we are wrong but when we point out possible (or
actual) errors in your statements, you aren\'t willing to discuss that,
instead you try a different angle of attack. If you are willing to
*discuss* things, then maybe you\'ll get better results.

 I\'m not talking about teaching about it for physicists, it should be
taught to everybody in basic school, not how to perform calculations but
how it works just as basic newtonian physics is taught to every child (at
least in Sweden).

It is also interesting that in the 3rd Imperium, X-boats are not named

	I wasn\'t worried about the infinite amount of time. I was worried that the

	I\'ve got trouble swallowing this. A point on the plane has its own unique
identity, regardless of the coordinate system and numeric base I use to
refer to it. Likewise,a point on the line has its own unique identity. So
if point A maps to point B, it should do so regardless of numeric base.

	Otherwise, using the example of jumpspace which started this whole
discussion off, if I go from a point in R3 to a point in J2, and QW\'rkl,
the 12-tentacled being, performs EXACTLY the same calculations in base-12,
he\'ll go from the SAME point in R3 to a completely different point in J2!
So if I don\'t like where I go in J2, I should try doing my math in base-12?

    Lets put things in a little perspective here: TSR is owned by _one
woman_. It is not a public company, there is no board of managers or
collective body of ownership. So, the _decision_ to sell was made by _one_
person. It is not like they are declaring bankruptcy or anything.
  _One_ person can have many reasons for selling. From what I\'ve heard from
people (designers) who have worked with them in the past year there has
been a great degree of dissatisfaction amongst the employees with the
managing director. (She is also the grand daughter of whoever invented Buck
Rogers and owns that trademark as well. That\'s why you occasionally see TSR
try to spit out a Buck Rogers game.)
  _I_ suspect that the trademark wasn\'t being as profitable as she would
have liked, she got tired of bitching employees, and when WotC offered her
a lump sum, she took it and said good riddance.
  One could see this as a good thing. With a caring management you might
have smoother internal operations. Bringing out a new Campaign Setting for
AD&D set in the Magic Universe could revitalise both the RPG market and the
CCG market.
  I tend to be more cynical. I fear the instability in transition. As
others have put it here, the sales of AD&D have kept Role Playing games on
the shelves in many shops. If TSR blips at all in their output then that
cuts significantly into the profits of shops (I won\'t even discuss what it
does to speciality shops!) forcing them to reduce the shelfspace they
devote to RPGs. And, gee, if they reduce the shelf space then it isn\'t AD&D
that is going to be falling off the ends, the lesser production will still
sell as well. It is going to be the marginals that go.
  Like Traveller.
  Face it: we\'re a marginal game. There has been no publicity blitz for The
New and Improved Traveller. There is no buzz in the marketplace. No new
gamers are buying the product. Just us old dinosaurs. If IG can keep its
margins low then it can exist selling a mainly mail-order product. But it
will never be able to afford the advertising necessary to grow the product
base.
  So don\'t laugh to heartily at this motion.

Uh-oh, the class far right winger has spoken.

Anything that\'s relevant to providing color to a campaign is relevant,
sturm. I started a thread a week or two ago about the color of the
atmosphere on very-thin tainted planets. A somewhat obscure subject, but
one that could inspire additional detail in individual refs\' adventures. I
don\'t think that anyone should try to "police" what constitutes a
discussion subject on this list.

While personally, I don\'t spend a whole lot of time on issues of sexuality
in my campaign, it is evident from the high volume of discussion on this
topic that quite a few people on this board find the topic interesting.

So if you don\'t like it, just gloss over them and move on instead of trying
to rain on others\' parade.

Best,

While, I agree that the idea of 1,000Kdt Super Dreadnoughts seems a bit much
in a role-playing session, consider the size of the 3I.  This empire spans
almost 11,000 star systems.  The Navy is the strong right arm of a decadent
society.  The citizens will want to see something impressive for their tax
dollars(and you can sure bet that a 1km long 1Mdt "Lord Imperial" class SDN
will make a helluva an impact contrasted with 200 5,000dt "battleships" or
even a few 100,000dt battleships).  There was a post for a 1Mdt DN
"Galaxia"(?) Class in the Missouri Archives that had so much armour(TNE terms
- - 5,600(?)) that only an equivalently sized ship could give it a run for the
money.  The Third Imperium was so wealthy that it could fund entire fleets of
such vessels at well below the standards set up in "World Tamers Handbook". 

We can\'t confuse capital ships with normal Traveller vessels.  The sight of a
simple 7,500dt Destroyer(J-4, 6Gs) or even a 1,500dt Corvette(J-2, 6Gs) ought
to throw the fear of God into the most foolhardy of Travellers.  Military
vessels are not standard plot foils.  They are kept on manuevers or at their
Depots(maintenance would be an immense task, fueling entire subsector
economies).  Travellers should at most encounter the Corvette which is
responsible for escorting larger commercial vessels, "Hercules" bulk
carriers(5,000dt).

Because - in a frame in which the starship is travelling rapidly and accelerating
(like the star rest frame) the fuel is actually *losing* energy; the fuel
comes out the back of the starship, as it were, and ends up moving more slowly
than the starship initially was - hence the fuel has lost kinetic energy
the ship has gained some, and the total (plus the energy liberated by
whatever heated the fuel) balances out.

There is a program that generates random words for Traveller languages.  It
has Vilani, Vargr, Zhodani, Droyne, and Aslan; and can generate up to six
syllables.

I\'m not sure where to get it, I found it as part of the Traveller suite a
few months back.

	This brings a question to my mind--what other expertise do we have out
there we could tap into. Say somebody has a very specific question--they\'d
be more likely to ask it if they knew there was somebody "qualified" to
answer it... Is there any interest in having people post a brief

I\'ll kick it off, just to break the ice. I\'ve a degree in aerospace

I think you are referring to Glenn Grant\'s D66 system.  Glenn does

Glenn\'s system on Jeff Zeitlen\'s Freelance Traveller page, and you

Gotcha.  So, when playing Traveller Starship combat, it\'s really more 
of an abstract system--kinda like the D&D 1 minute combat round or 
the 8 hour turns that a lot of war games have.

Hmm.  I wonder if it is worth the work to scale down the Starship 
combat rules so that you could have 6 second combat rounds (or, I\'d 
settle for 1 minute combat rounds) so that you could focus on the 
roleplaying inside the character\'s ship.

(Scratching chin)  I wonder....

Got it, but never used it.

THAT\'S why I never used it!

with a focus to what was happening inside the ship--the focus was on 
role playing.

With my current campaign, I\'m looking at using more ship fights

which set of starship combat rules do people like.

There are so many.

The CT basic system from the Little Black Books, Starter Traveller, 
and the Traveller Book.

The Book 5 High Guard system.

Mayday.

The MT system from the Referee\'s Manual.

Basic system in TNE main book.

Brilliant Lances.

Battle Rider.

And...

The hard to follow system in T4\'s Book 1.



The question is:

Which starship combat system is your favorite?

I\'m curious, and I want to hear what the distiguished, learned 
members of this list perfer in way of their starship combats.

I wouldn\'t consider a 14 day (one jump there;  one jump 
back) communication time lag *nothing*--I don\'t care how many ships 
you have making the jump.

This isn\'t Star Trek, and there is no subspace.

Have you been across the border lately?  I have.  Just over the Rio 
in Acuna, they\'ve got people living in tin shacks with dirt floors.

These aren\'t Mexico\'s homeless--its some of their citizens.  Ever 
wonder why there are so many revolutionary uprisings?  Ever bought a 
Mexican car?  Ever wonder why all of those people are so determined 
to find their ways over here?

True, in Traveller terms, the tech levels are not that vast in scale 
difference--but, I think you missed the point.

The point was that it is not that unrealistic to have a very high 
tech level star system next to a very low tech level system.

I think that this is where GM creativity comes in.

For instance, my characters are on Pysadi--TL 4.  Yet, the planet has 
a Class C starport and a tainted atmosphere.

It is clear that some technology over TL 4 exists, and it is my job, 
as GM, to decide what things are greater than TL 4.

I think that TL 4 should be used as a general rule for the planet.  
When you see some area that the planet definitely needs a higher TL 
for, change it.  In this case, it is the technology of sealed 
buildings and air recirculation.



In thinking about the TL with regard to a whole planet, that should 
be taken as an average, general measure.

I know the tech level categories are very broad, but (I\'ll use 
my best Bogart impression here) there is no way that one TL code can 
cover all the areas of technology on all of the planets in the whole 
universe.

A GM has got to make some creative choices--that\'s what he\'s there 
for.

One thing that I like to use as a guide is that wonderful product, 
DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook.

Whenever I think the PCs are going to stay on a planet for any length 
of time (or buy equipment there), I always use the book\'s technology 
rules to give me a guide.

For those of you who are not familiar with this book, you should get 
it.  I use it all the time.  Find it second hand somewhere or through 
a game shop that sells out of print Traveller stuff.

Using Pysadi\'s primary TL of 4, the book allows me to generate 
specific tech levels for several different areas of interest.

As a GM, I can then use these new TL codes (which are based on the 
planet\'s overall TL code) as a guide when the characters are looking 
for a specific piece of equipment.

Some people talk about the "bleed" that should occur when a 
planet is next to another high tech planet.  I think that these new 
specific TL codes reflect this quite nicely.

Let\'s look at what I\'ve come up with for Pysadi for an example.

Pysadi,  Overall TL 4

Energy TL 4
Computers/Robotics TL 4
Communications TL 4
Water Transport TL 4
Air Transport TL 3
Heavy Military TL 0
Medical TL 4
Environment TL 5     (note that sealed environments become available 
                                  at TL 5)
Land Transport TL 4
Space Transport TL 4
Personal Military TL 2
Novelty TL C


Given that Pysadi is alone, by it self out in the scatters of the 
Aramis subsector, I am happy with the results--they are pretty 
homogeneous (hey!  this is not the sex thread!).

I did fudge one roll when I developed Pysaid--but it was only one 
roll, and it was necessary.  That was for Environment TL.  I actually 
rolled a 4 (after modification for other factors), but I knew it had 
to be at least a 5 to allow for the sealed environments needed for 
the population to keep out the tainted atmosphere.

But, the rest were all legit and based on the factors given Pysadi\'s 
location, etc.  As far as the fudge goes...I\'m the GM, and I need to 
make those creative decisions every once in a while.

I really like how the military TLs came out--I view Pysadi as 
ruled by this religous cult with strengent laws and a tight hand on 
the public.  Guns are definitely not allowed, and a black market has 
not flourished.

Remembering the "bleed" from having a high tech planet near by, check 
out the Novelty TL of C above.

Whoosh.  Right over the top of the other TL 4 stuff.

I take it that these "novelties" float into the Pysadian culture from 
Aramis--a TL 11 planet two parsecs away.

I\'m being pretty strict with this novelty category though.  The 
Pysadians are not xenophobic, but they do stick together more than 
most cultures.  They keep a watchful eye on strangers.

And you can see this with how they placed their starport.  It\'s not 
right smack-dab in the middle of a city.  It\'s about two klicks away, 
out by itself.

That way, they keep a distance from the "non-believers".  Travellers 
who want to visit Sadi, Pysadi\'s closest city to the starport (and 
capitiol), can take the train for a nominal fee.



With all of this emphasis on Traveller rules with regard to TLs, I\'d 
say that we might be forgetting the most important part of world 
creation...

...the GM\'s imagination.

Ignoring the fact that it isn\'t really a true democracy (*are* there 
any?), how about the fact that it abolished slavery and gave women the 
vote *after* the British? And that in some areas segregation was only 
abolished 30 years ago? And I won\'t even mention Senator Joe Macarthy...

Not an anti-US flame, just pointing out that \'the land of the free\' has

Um, no.  The evidence is of a correlation between gay behavior and
certain genes.  It doesn\'t mean that gay behavior can\'t also be
learned (and so means that you can\'t be sure that Norris has the
gene) or that possetion of the gener means you will be gay.

You can only say that there seems to be a higher chance
that she will be gay, and even then you might only be
raising it from a 2% chance to a 5% chance. >>

Bearing in mind Norris\'s clone is female, how would it affect her? Would 
she be gay from her point of view (ie attracted to women) or his (ie 
attracted to men - in other words, straight)?

Actually, it does, but not in the sense I _think_ the original author meant.

Any battle rider is going to either be faster or nastier than a jump
capable ship in real space.  Therefore, if your naval doctrine has put
faster drives on the battle riders, any ship that is capable of keeping up
with them is going to be referred to as fast, because it can catch a jump
ship.

If your doctrine has gone for better weaponry, then the word "fast" means
little, but your battle riders are going to pulverize any comparable
tonnage and cost ship they meet.

This leaves out the idea of jump speed as a measure of speed.  Since I
figured that ships all tend top have the same strategic speed, and that
this changes slowly, all military ships in the Imperial navy are jump 3,
with J2 hulls lurking about.

There are over 100 pages of Starships, Charcters, Groups, Equipment and
other things.  While most of the pages are dedicated to the RC, and use
TNE rules, there are ships that use T4 design systems. (and even one

You will also find a few Spinward Marches files on my Traveller page,
but these aren\'t part of the BARD pages.  

If you have a reference to the BARD pages please change the URL.

"Action-packed" in Hollywood usual translates to "lots of gunfire and
explosions."

But there are some sequences in RW that I\'ve always wanted to see filmed..
the flight through the Eye Storm, the riot when Louis and Co first meet the
Ring\'s inhabitants, Louis\' first night with \'Prill  :)

Actually, it\'s linear with velocity: 
power required = (mass of ship)*(acceleration)*(velocity relative to planet)

Still, not very efficient.

"sexually oriented" material since, as this thread has shown (IMO, at

provide a lot of interesting background color, as well as plot devices and
rp opportunities, without necessarily dwelling in the gutter.

that there\'s a lot of interesting ideas to be mined and incorporated here,

	Bingo! I think that that is the essential reason you\'ll have low
tech vs high tech worlds next to each other. Mexico can (and actually
does)  produce much that the US can...look at your TV, microwave or GM
vehicle sometime...a lot of them are made in the \'maliqadora\' plants along
the border, or at least components of them are. But the crucial thing
limiting technology in Mexico is money, pure and simple. To get an idea of
that compare the lives of the rich to the poor. The upper classes in
Mexico live comparable lives to anyone of similar economic class in the
US. Let me amend that, people of _any_ class in Mexico live pretty much as
the comparable class in the US, it\'s just that their lower socioeconomic
classes go lower and are so much larger that those in the US. 

	The largely agrarian recent history of Mexico has exacerbated
that...far more people people live under subsistence farming conditions
than in the much more industrialized US. In many ways, the situation in
Mexico resembles the difference between the Industrial North and Agrarian
South in the US, hell, well into this century. Many of the same conditions
applied as well: grinding poverty, malnutrition, an exodus of workers
north (does ANY of this sound remotely familiar???) This is what built the
industrial revolution in cities like Detroit and Chicago.

	Additionally, Mexico has largely restricted foreign investment,
until recently, they had a bone-headed \'nativist\' economic policy, as well
as a misplaced belief (in the 70\'s and 80\'s) that the oil money would flow
forever.

	All in all, I think that this will be the case in the \'classic\'
Imperium;  the TL-3 planet next door to the TL-C planet will be so due to
poverty, poor economic policy, or similar reasons.  Remember Tech level
refers to the Tech Level COMMONLY available on the planet. The wealthy
will live at the prevailing regional TL;  they\'ll just pay more for the
oil changes on their air/raft. 

	In Milieu 0 things could well be different, though, you could have
truly stone age worlds next to starfaring worlds. The Long Night
constrained trade for so long that even at 1 parsec away, the poor worlds
weren\'t worth trading with.

My favorite version, which seems to be the easiest to teach goes like:

First Law of Thermodynamics Poker: You can\'t win.
Second Law of Thermodynamics Poker: You can\'t break even.
Third Law of Thermodynamics Poker: You can\'t get out of the game.

I think I stole this from either Larry Niven or Robert Heinlein.

From my education, we were taught basic newtonian physics in 8th grade
science class (roller skates on a plane, that sort of thing) and
thermodynamics (under the guise of how refrigerators work) later, in high
school, I think.

Don\'t know how it\'s done now, as it\'s been a hell of a long time since I
was in 8th grade :-/ and I\'m NOT going into any flamefest of the merits of
any country\'s educational system.

But I have taught non-sci/tech people the rough outlines of thermodynamic
using the three laws above pretty easily. Once you \'get\' it, it\'s fairly
easy to generalize.

 	Yes... and, think about the following: In normal space, what we see can
 usually be approximated by "continuum" situations... we think the matter is
 sort of continuous, although each body is formed by a finite (although
 large) number of atoms. So, the shape of normal (aleph-0) space resembles
 something like aleph-1. What would Jspace-1 seem? Probably, something that
 could be described as Aleph-2... the cardinal of the set curves... you see
 some sort of mess with curving rays all around... and your mind cannot
 really cope with it, you are an aleph-0 creature. If you view Jspace-n,
 n>=2, you just cannot
 understand the difference with Jspace-2.
 	(Btw, just understanding all the implications of Jumpspace theory/
 /transfinite numbers may be enough to go insane... it\'s said that a Solomani
 mathematician called Kantor went insane when discovering the theory,
centuries
 before the discovery of Jspace...)

 	Ooops.. true. I did speak too fast. Change the above paragraph to:
 
 	When starting jump, the lanthanum grid exponentially increases the
 variance of meta-quantum situations in its particles (the particles of the
 grid). In the limit, the grid cannot be contained in its space and so
 "jumps" into the appropriate one, along with a bubble of normal space
 containing the ship.

Can\'t remember which book it was now but I remember that the author described
Jumpspace as totally disorienting to most people to the point that if you
weren\'t tranqualized there was a good chance you would come out insane.  Only
special people could manage to be in Jumpspace untranked without going mad
and they became the Navigators in Jumpspace.  I might be combining a couple
of stories here though. But it is one take on Jumpspace.  The tranqualizer
did not completely put people under just induced a near sleep state where
they could still manage to eat and potty.  But no sit down meals, just tube
meals.  Its been along time since I read it, anyone else remember anything
along these lines?

	Hey, I thought I was the class right-winger :-(  How did sturm get that 
honour?

	But as much as I personally disapprove of homosexuality (and I won\'t bring 
up gay marriage or adoption), the topic of gays in the imperium certainly 
is relevant. And I just got the Regency Sourcebook in the mail yesterday 
(note: interesting read, but no wonder GDW went out of business printing 
books that looked that ugly) and Norris\'s being gay is DEFINITELY in the 
subtext.

But this topic, pretty much like any other on this or any other mailing 
list, is starting to drift pretty badly (i.e. I could care less for the 
discussion of the percentage of gays in todays society, or the discussion 
of homosexuality in ancient greece). Please stop these threads.

One point:  The Medal of Honor is awarded for Valor above and beyond the
call of duty while in combat. (The word "Congressional" has never been part
of the awards name, although Congress does vote on awarding the Medal.)

Maj. Yaeger would probably have recieve a Distinguished Service Medal
(highest non-combat award), along with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Also, were there *two* Maj. Yaegers?  I ask because of the phrasing above.

All in all, very interesting.. I hope to see more soon.

Damn!  You\'re living Traveller!

I\'m afraid that that my background is not as exciting nor as 
relevant to Traveller, but here goes anyway.

I graduated with honors from the University of Houston with a BBA in 
Marketing.  From there, I negotiated contracts with hospitals in the 
nations\'s largest medical center here in Houston for a medical sales 
company.  Since, I have started my own resume writing company, and I 
have been in business for a year and a half now.

Aside from that, one of my biggest interests (besides role playing) 
is in filmmaking.  I\'ve done a short film in school and a couple of 
videos.  I\'ve had one of my videos shown on the local PBS station, 
and I recently finished a business video for Famous Amos cookies.  My 
current project is a music sales video for a local country band.  I\'m 
busy writing a script that I intend to film on a very low budget, and 
my dream is to become a writer/director.

Like I said, there\'s not a lot that relates to Traveller there, but 
at least by doing this, we might get to know each other a little 
better.

Kenneth.

If they do, you can be sure we\'ll see a sequel that combines Niven\'s known

[vision of Coca-Cola spewing out of my nose]

I\'m game, although I doubt my resume is anywhere near as impressive.
I guess we\'ll just have to bring out the rulers later on and measure
;)

Here goes... (gulp)

I have nearly ten years of automotive repair experience under my belt,
and at one point even considered returning to school to acquire an
engineering degree so I could teach those bozos at GM how to *really*
design a vehicle.  I also race autocross, which requires me to know a
lot about custom vehicle design (as well as how vehicles interact with
a road surface).  I actually managed to get all four wheels on my \'90
Sprint Turbo off of the ground at one event *without* the use of any
"ramp-like" device (what a ride *that* was).  I also drove the first
Corvette ZR-1 imported into Canada through a McDonald\'s Drive Thru
(oooh... ahhh...) :P

I also have thousands of hours of exposure to PBS, the Knowledge
Network, the Learning Channel, the Discovery Channel, and Bill Nye.  I
believe this brings me up to Dave\'s EDU rating :)

Anyone else care to embarrass themselves?

Jump time is irrelevant since trader captains deal with this every
time his ship moves from system to system.

The key here is whether or not the two systems have any way of
benefiting each other.  If a merchant has a load of TL15 cargo that he
knows he can sell to the TL1 world, or knows that the TL1 world has
something to offer the neighbouring TL15 world, *he will make the
trip*.

This is all irrelevant.  A poor country is not necessarily a lower
tech country.  While it may be true most of the time, it is not
"fact".

I never disagreed here.  It was just that you backed up your claim by
referring to two adjoining countries whose dominant difference is
based more on *national wealth* than *technology*.

I also had a problem with this battery as it consumes one-tenth
of the power of the same (damage-wise) battery in QSDS. There
is clearly a discompatibility between QSDS and SSDS here.

I\'m a (recently-graduated) PhD astronomer. My current astronomy interests
are extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs, and high-resolution imaging of solar
system objects (Io and Titan in particular.) So I can deal with (some)
astronomy questions...

More relevantly to the perpetual arguments on gdw-beta, I also do quite a bit
of work on astronomical instrumentation - originally infrared cameras, and
now adaptive optics (correcting the blurring due to the earth\'s atmosphere)
with laser guide stars (using a laser to make an artificial reference source
100km up to use for this correction), so I know a fair amount about sensors,
detection, and lasers. I\'m actually currently working at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, but I keep my Traveller mail here at UCLA due to a feeling
that LLNL electronic censors might get slightly befuddled by discussions of
nuclear x-ray lasers and hypervelocity kinetic kill missiles...

	I\'ll preface this by saying that I\'m (a) a gearhead, (b) an engineer, and
(c) was on the "science" side of the recent Sturm und Drang between realism
and playability. I\'ve also only played ship combat a few times as part of a
campaign.

	*Loved* it. The detail level is high, which is good and bad. Good, because
your players\' skills will directly impact the results--gunner, pilot,
engineer, etc. You can tell them exactly what got hit, where, how badly.

	Bad, because setup can take a while, filling out the form. I
shortcircuited this by typing all the ship control panels into Word. Put
them into a sheetprotector, and use overhead markers.

	The first few times you play, parts will go slow. I\'d recommend a
"standalone" combat one night, just to get used to the rules.

	Ditch the complicated (and failed) attempt at a realistic movement system,
and grab Mayday! movement.

Actually, as a person with a history degree and only the most minute 
interest in most of the things above ( with the exception of Imperial 
politics ), I\'m very interested in the make-up of the society of the 
Imperium at large.

Maybe I am the only one that cares about this, but as it IS an ongoing

If you look at the map of Vland itself (Vilani & Vargr inside front
cover) you will see that the Vilani do name their oceans and seas.
They have names like Irup Khligash Ar, Uunkida Gar, Arzemiir, Kigunar
Iruplan Ar, Dir Gar, Padusdaam Sakugar Ki, and Eshka Ar.  This tends to
suggest to me that the Villani word for sea or ocean is Ar and  Gar is a
variant form.

Interestingly the seas and oceans on Lair, the Vargrs second home world,
are not named, but the bodies of water on  Terra and Kusyu are (Solomani
and Aslan).  Maybe it is the Vargr who don\'t always name bodies of
water.

I had always assumed that a deliberate choice not to name the XBoats was
made by a committee who figured out how many names they would need to
come up with and decided that it was more trouble than it was worth. Or
if you want to continue the tradition of Illuminated Traveller the
secret controllers of the Imperium did not want the details of the flow
of information in the Imperium (which could be followed by tracing
XBoats) to be known.  After all it is easier to change a number than a
name...

Ether propellers.  In Space: 1889, the Luminiferous Ether (a medium in
which light propagates, much as sound waves propagate in air) is real,
just as 19th century science (in general) believed.  An ether propeller is
a rotating, electrically charged gizmo at the back of a spacecraft; the
particular pattern of charging used allows it to push against the ether
just as a normal propeller pushes against air or water.  The technology
was invented by Thomas Edison, by the way, who built a prototype and flew
it to Mars with Jack Armstrong and a third person whom I can\'t recall
offhand. 

Space: 1889 never covered interstellar travel (to my knowledge), but
there\'d certainly be nothing stopping you from trying...with the gosh-wow
science feel in the game, handwaving into existence a dangerous prototype
ether \'speedboat\' fast enough to reach Proxima Centauri in a few months
wouldn\'t be out of place.

> - -What is the scope of the game??  where does it take place? on just Mars and

No, it takes place throughout the Solar System -- as the solar system was
imagined prior to the mid-20th century.  Mars has canals and ancient
feuding races, Venus is a steaming jungle planet with dinosaurs and
lizardmen, Mercury is a one-face world with a slim habitable zone along
the twilight line, Luna has an evil underground civilization, and so
forth. 

My favorite description is that it\'s set in the solar system, the way the
solar system *should* be. :)

If you want to assume that Norris was gay because of his genetics,
and that anyone with those genes is gay (quite a bit of assuming
but all things that are not proven or disproven by current evidence,
though that last part is a bit of a jump), then you have to
decide a few things...
1) Is the gene present on the Y chromosome?  If so the clone
isn\'t gay.
2) Otherwise, It could go either way.  One might think that
a gene "wired" you to be attracked to a fixed gender (as
opposed a gender based on what you already are) would be
simpler (and hence more likely).  OTOH, attraction is
clearly set up to be relative to your gender.  OTOOH
(on the "other other" hand :-), it may be that the
attraction is absolute but for some people the gene
for attraction to the men turns itself on regardless
of whether you are male or not.

The bottom line is that there simply isn\'t any data
to make this kind of determination....

Yes, but dont you think considering the highly gender-oriented Aslan way 
of dealing with things, that the fact that Norris could be gay would have 
a high effect on those relations?   I would say it was a distinct 
possibility.  Indeed, I\'d be willing to wager that an Aslan would be the 
biggest homophobe you knew.  Consider how that would effect relations 
with them and you\'ll perhaps see how this affects the political structure 
of the Marches and the Domain of Deneb as a whole.

So... I guess the question now is would the average person on the average 
world care if Norris had come right out and said " Hey, I\'m a 
homosexual."  The fact that we are having this discussion implies that 
yes they would care, else it would be clearer.

Further, how do the Darrians, Sword Wolders, Zhos and Aslan feel about 
this?  In a text written by a TMLer several years back called " 
Traveller\'s Little Talk for When You\'re Old Enough ", it was stated that 
the Aslan found male homosexuality to be highly dishonorable.  I feel 
that fits in with accepted canon concerning the Aslan.  Is this perhaps 
why he kept closeted?

Just a thought.

STOP. Stop right there! The Aslan are ALIENS, not people in fuzz suits,

ALIENS!!!

Why...these are _Humans_ they\'re dealing with after all! Why would an
Aslan CARE about what some of these furless tree apes with no concept of

And the managing female Aslan sighs, and tries to figure out how to get

We term Aslan \'male\' and \'female\' for convenience sake, because of the
roles they seem to take on in their societies (and their biology IIRC,
Aslan females bear the young)

What their sexual roles are are probably waaaay beyond our comprehension,
as ours are to them.

Whoa!  I agreed with a lot of what you said, but not this!  

C is about 300,000km/s, and we\'ve pretty much been using 30,000km hexes, so
there are 10 hexes in ONE light second.  Four light seconds is 1,200,000km
or *40* hexes!  To me that\'s long range, with a low probability of getting
a hit.

        Three years out of college, with a degree in computer science, minoring 
in physics (emphasis on astrophysics).  Took me six years to get my degree 
because of two misguided years in aerospace engineering.

        Have worked on medical databases and co-wrote the first live 
perioperative charting system to go on line (hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa), 
and am now a system analyst with a world-wide brokerage firm.  On of my programs
(Bridge Workstation) is also going to be in a move coming out soon (_The Game_ 
starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn).

        Not *too* bad for this 26 year old...

        Extensive readings in medieval, Roman, and (US) Revolutionary history.  
Beginning swordsman and armourer (though I do *great* mail).  I also am 
completely addicted to TLC (Totalitarian Leaders Channel), TDC (The Dictator\'s 
Channel), A&E (Adolph and Eichman Channel), etc, etc: just about the only TV I 
watch (besides Babylon 5 and Joe Bob Briggs Drive-In)  Traveller player/GM since
1980.

        As for my greatest achievement, I was lucky enough to marry a wonderful 
woman with degrees in history and political science, and MPA, and ABD on her 
Ph.D.

Calculate and write down the ones you need (like JoAT and Brawling), and
ignore the rest.  I can see a reason for a reduced JOAT effect, not sure I
see one for Brawling.  Just how many other skills use Attribute +
Skill-points/3,d rather than Attribute + Skill-points?

Doesn\'t *have* to be metal poor world.  You could go the "1889" route of
postulating something like needing a "liftwood" hull to give your craft the
ability to lift above the atmosphere.  Or just run the base Tech level at 3
or 4, and make *certain* technologies *much* easier to discover. ;->

Remember, the old wooden ships often had metal plate on their
bottoms, and along their waterlines.  You might have metal armor bolted on
selected parts of your ships.

I use vacuum tube technology in my games too.  (You can have quantum effect
transisters OR anti-gravity..and the space drives that come with it, but
not both.  ;-> Space faring cultures opt for
anti-gravity.)

I\'m trying..fitfully, but trying!  One minute turns anyway, ;-> and
precisely for the purpose of PBEM roleplaying.  James Garriss and Bob
Sanders are working on something like this, too.   Joe Walsh\'s RPSCS
started off headed in that direction, but got detoured to 30 minute turns
somewhere along the way. 

> (Scratching chin)  I wonder....

Yeah, I do too...<wink>

Things to wonder about..if you go to 1 minute turns:

1.  And keep 30,000km hexes as the basic scale, then you\'ve got to
drastically increase ship velocities, to travel even *1* hex in 1
minute requires a velocity of 1.8 million kph, or make movement
rates something like 1 hex per 6 turns.

2.  And keep velocities about where they are now, then you\'ve got to
drastically decrease the basic 30,000km range scale...and all the
effects that will have on weapons!

3.  And keep the current weapon ranges, then everyone will stay at
such long ranges that you will fire and fire and fire, hitting every
30 or 40 turns.

4.  And have an exciting chance of hitting the other ship, then you
will need to drasticly reduce the ranges of the weapons.  This force
combatants to close to ranges where the chances of a hit grow high
enough to be fun.

    4a.  And then you might have to reduce the damage value of the
    weapons, or increase the armor value of the ships.
    
    4b.  And you certainly will have to change the published weapons
    to reflect the shorter ranges, etc.
    
See, I\'ve been wondering too!

A parsec is a week and 8,000 credits, less if you feel lucky.  Much less
if you\'re freight rather than a sophont.  That\'s not very far.

I\'d call ship/xboat electronic messaging and package delivery over a
one-week delay pretty practical communication.  The US held together
rather well at a time when parts of the country were at least *three*
weeks away from Washington even via special mounted courier, and more like
two months via scheduled postal runs.

Not really.

"Vastly different?"  The US is borderline TL 8, perhaps higher in computer
technology and the like.  Mexico is unarguably borderline TL 7, more
probably a solid mid-7; they produce cars, electronics, and other
high-tech gadgetry *for export to the US*, as well as sale to their own
citizens, and a full infrastructure of power, roads, and so forth to
support and use these tools exists.  Mexico and the US are at the very
most one TL apart, and I think about half a TL is a better description.

The lowest-tech *countries* (not isolated tribes) on the planet are
currently low TL 6.  Even those few isolated tribes of lower TL are
rapidly disappearing as they assimilate into higher-tech societies
surrounding them.

Poor, yes, but you\'ll find TL 7 manufacturing and repair facilities in
abundance in both states, and a smattering of TL 8 around New Orleans.  TL
does not necessarily correlate perfectly to affluence, though in general
it\'s a good rule of thumb.

Culturally, perhaps, economically, quite likely, technologically -- no
way.  Culture, affluence, and technology are independent variables.

The poorest part of my city (Los Angeles) is the region due south of
downtown.  Part of the reason housing is so cheap there is that Vernon is
smack dab in the middle of it.  Vernon is a tiny city with a population of
about 70; it\'s jammed with heavy industry that locates there for the
massive tax advantages, and because there\'s a major rail yard there.  A
good chunk of the high-TL-7 chemical synthesis going on in LA is happening
precisely in the very poorest part of the city.

Conversely, Beverly Hills is one of the richest parts of the city...but
move it into isolation, and the people would have virtually *no*
locally-produced technology.  Nothing gets manufactured, and very little
repaired, inside Bev Hills itself; virtually everything is imported for
sale, or sent elsewhere for repairs.  Bev Hills thrown on its own
resources would be TL 4-5, tops.

My point is that technology spreads differently from, and much better
than, wealth.  In LA, the rich people have shiny new TL 7.9 sports cars,
and the poor people have clunky old TL 7.1 junkers...big difference in
style, comfort, reliability, and so forth, but basically similar
technology.  Even those without cars ride TL 7.5 buses and TL 7.8
light-rail trains.  Tech seeps into *all* the cracks.

I\'ve played this, and it was fun, but Mayday was much easier (and I
*know* you have Mayday ;-)

> The Book 5 High Guard system.

HG is good for fleet actions, and as a quick way to generate results
for roleplaying----it leaves a lot in the dark though, and myself,
and others I\'ve played with like to drive ships around more than
totally abstract ranges.
 
> Mayday.
 
Pretty good.  You can always use HG for fire and damage resolution.
I would be inclined to not use agility as a DM on HG fire in this
case unless the ship is evading.  What you\'d do is require ships to
use part of their m-drive capability for evasion (if they have any
left after maneuver).  Use that for the Agility DM, but don\'t allow
it to exceed their agility rating.

> The MT system from the Referee\'s Manual.
 
Never really used it much, but you could tack the tasks onto Mayday
and use them...

> Brilliant Lances.

Time consuming to set up, but once you have everything together
(Dave Golden has some great ship forms on his site (er, or did
anyway)) to play.  I have some fixes/additions to the system to add
detail, but frankly I\'m swinging in the other direction these days
:-)

> Battle Rider.
 
Battle Rider isn\'t bad at all once you fix some basic problems
(which were fairly major).  I have those fixes, and they are also on
some web sites.  It has a MAyday-like movement system, and is good
for fleet actions, though the damage system is all in terms of
critical hits, so players ships will get toasted pretty quickly
unless they are crew on a ship of the line.

> The hard to follow system in T4\'s Book 1.
 
Broken beyond repair, IMHO.  

You might try the Role Playing Space Combat System on Wildstar\'s
page----it\'s pretty good for player dominated games (all personal
task based----I give the computers more credit than an 1970s
calculator, so I have a little trouble with it ;-)  <===note smile
(no flame intended!)
 
> Which starship combat system is your favorite?
 
I like Mayday/HG bash pretty well, and I\'m working on a BR/BL/T4
bash that is about like MD/HG.  The problem with MD/HG is that it
doesn\'t use the new design system results.

I also like more sensor ops in there, unfortunately, the more I
think About it, the harder it is *not* to be detected.  BR handles
this pretty  well since you stay detected once Locked up, which
makes a lot of sense.

You could use BR or MD with any fire/dmage resolution system,
however, and that would be my suggestion.

Unlikely.  Ships of the line in traveller are almost always built to
maximum Mdrive that g-comp can support.  The point of batteriders
was that they could use the space for jdrive and fuel for
weapons/armor.

Nah, mdrive is cheap, and the best defense for any ship since
evasion works against all weapons.

Also, I hate calling high acceleration "fast."

True, but it still ain\'t "fast." :-)

	Now you know why I don\'t get Traveller mail at my place of work! ("Excuse
me, captain. Could you please explain this email about knocking down

A full month later, they received the message ... minus body, just the

off-base mail gets rerouted to the SP shop for review before getting out.

	Wow! This just raises a really big question in my mind--I don\'t really
care either way about whether Norris pitches or catches... but what about
sexual orientation in other Traveller species? Especially one like the
Aslan, which has gender-specific behavioural patterns that seem to be at
least in part biologically driven? And how does sexual orientation affect
those?

	No big question about Vargr...anybody who\'s owned a dog knows they\'ll
mount just about anything that holds still (what do you do when a pit bull
starts humping your leg? Fake an orgasm!).

    'body' => 'Looking at die modifiers and KBv2.0:



I\'ve received two private posts from two different people this 
week who had questions about KBv2.0.  

These two posts contained something that surprised me, and since two 
people have written me asking questions about the same topic, I 
thought that I\'d post an answer here in case there are any others out 
there using KBv2.0 having the same question.

The question revolves around die modifiers when using KBv2.0.

Do you need to alter the DMs in any way when you use my alternate 
task system?  

Answer:  No.

Does a +1 DM, when you are using KBv2.0, give you as much benefit as 
it does when using the official T4 task system?

Answer:  Yes.



One of the questions I got revolved around the optional tactical pool 
that you can find on page 60 of Book 1, and it makes for a good 
example--so I\'ll use it here.

This person\'s questions was:  Does a +1 in KBv2.0 benefit you as much 
as it does in T4, and what can you do to the tactical pool so that 
you can recieve the same amount of benefit in KBv2.0?

Again, the answer is yes, a +1 DM (or any DM) will give you the 
same benefit no matter which of the two task systems you are using, 
so, you don\'t have to do anything to the tactical pool  Use it just 
like it is written in the book.

KBv2.0 was designed to fit as seamlessly as possible with the 
existing T4 rules.  If you had to go around changeing all the 
modifiers, the system wouldn\'t be an easy fit with the official T4 
game mechanics, and frankly, I wouldn\'t be advocating the system.



Comparison of DMs between KBv2.0 and T4:

Comparing KBv2.0 and T4 is like comparing apples and oranges because 
of the different philosophy taken towards the impact of skills on the 
success chance of a task.  In KBv2.0, the emphasis is ballanced 
between skills and attributes.  In T4, the emphasis is on attributes 
with tweaking done by a character\'s skill level.

But, you can still compare the two systems, and you might be 
surprised at how close they are.

Our example character is Sonep.  Sonep\'s going to attempt a Difficult 
task.                       Sonep         Skill-3, Attribute-7

In T4, Sonep has a target number of 10.
In KBv2.0, Sonep has a target number of 16.

A Difficult task in T4 is a  2.5 D proposition.
A Difficult task in KBv2.0 is a 4 D proposition.

The probability of rolling the T4 task is 71.3%.
The probability of rolling the KBv2.0 task is 76.08%.



Now, let\'s say that Sonep gets a +1 DM from his friendly gamemaster.



Sonep\'s target number in T4 becomes 11.
Sonep\'s target number in KBv2.0 becomes 17.

The probability of rolling the T4 task becomes 82.4%.
The probability of rolling the KBv2.0 task becomes 84.1%.


As you can see, the changes because of the DM are relative--they\'re 
not exact because of the nature of 6 sided dice, but they\'re pretty 
damn close.

If you have any questions, contact me.

 The jump drive operates by opening a hole into a type of "hyperspace",
 called jump space strangely enough.  There are 36 known "levels" of jump
 space, although only the first six are able to be used reliably.  
 
 A ship\'s jump drive is a large fusion plant, designed to burn a great amount
 of fuel in a very short period to provide the burst of power needed to tear
 open the hole in normal space.  There is some debate as to how much jump
 fuel is actually used as fuel, and how much is used as coolant, but that
 seems to be more a matter of style.
 
 Starships have either inner jump coils (Classic Traveller) or a hull grid
 (Mega Traveller+) made of lanthanum.  (I prefer the hull grid theory.)  The
 lanthanum is vital to opening the jump hole, and is quite valuable as a
result.
 
 The mechanics of astrogation are glossed over in the rules... there is a was
 to set your course, but we aren\'t really told what it is.  Most starports
 sell or provide pre-set jump coordinates for neighboring systems.
 
 Each jump number indicates what level of j-space it can enter.  A Jump-2
 ship can enter jumpspace that will allow it to travel 2ly in approx 168
 hours (+/- 10%).  The largest jump possible, at TL15, is six.  The only way
 to jump further is through an uncontrolled mis-jump, which can take you up
 to 36ly away from your starting point!

I once had it explained to me this way:
Picture a piece of paper that represents part of space.  Label one point as
the departure point and another point on the the far side as point of
destination. To get from one point to another the Jump drive can somehow fold
space.  Picture folding the paper and putting the point of departure and
point of destination together.  Viola\'. You Jump from one point to the other
without crossing the realspace in between.  The week time frame is much
handwaving.  (as is the whole theory for that matter)

Oh, speaking of AI - I went to the library today to check out that

Wow, through and through with the arm traumatically amputated.  He
goes quickly into shock, and bleeds to death without fast medical
attention.  Tying off his arm will at least keep him from bleeding
to death, but that is a nasty wound.

The trick is that the combat system should kill people easily, but
not easily within the confines of combat rounds which are very short
intervals.  Deadly systems tend to get the end results the same as
they would be with no medical care, but exaggerate things in typical
5 second intervals (IMHO).

I imagine it takes several minutes for most gunshot casualties to
die even if mortally wounded, though they might be unable to fight
fairly quickly.

Another thing to look at is the scumbag factor----rate NPCs and PCs
by how nice they are, nice guys die fast, the scumbags tend to be
indestructable :-)  Damara maintains that niceness is a "poor
prognostic indicator" from her hectic intern experience. Hmmm, maybe
she\'ll get home soon *sigh*  :-)

As far as Traveller goes, I\'m a CT 100% from way back, but haven\'t played
or even kept up with the timeline development since about 1989 or
thereabouts.  This Rebellion and Virus thing has been a real shock for me.
I\'m interested in doing background sorts of things for Traveller, but not
playing at this point -- a pocket empire or two, maybe.

For the record:  1) I like the *idea* of fighters in Traveller, but don\'t
see how they\'re widely useful in any practical way, and would rather revise

at a holding company, where I\'ve worked for the last 4.5 years.  There, 
I do HR stuff, but since it\'s a small office I also do general office 
management - everything from delivering mail, to getting temps in, to 
supervising some of the secretaries and the receptionist - plus I head 
up the purchasing department on a corporate-wide basis (which 
essentially seems to mean that I get to tell people who know way more 
than I do about purchasing what they can and cannot buy, and from whom 
they can buy it).  And in my free time, I try to keep the information 
flowing from IG to TMLers, and sometimes help Stu & Suz Dollar write 
stuff for Traveller. And if you think this post has poor punctuation, 
spelling, and grammar, you should see some of my stuff that Suz has had 
to edit.

If you\'re basing this on WW II or modern navies these two should probably be

There is no star travel in 1889.
Space travel is by Ether Propellers, powered by steam generated by solar
power. This means that travel beyond the asteroid belt is nearly
immpossible, as the battery technology isn\'t up to it yet.

You just made it relevant. :)  And the sad part is, I understood most of
what you said there!  I have a degree in cognitive science (psych, comp
sci, neurology, and AI mixed with bits of anthropology, sociology, art,
chem, and such) and am working as a game designer.  I\'ve been a programmer
and UI consultant for most of my career.

I began playing wargames in the early days of Avalon Hill and SPI, and
began designing them shortly thereafter..never tried to publish anything,
just did it for myself and the players around me.  I\'ve played the campaign
version of 1914 and "borrowed" a gymnasium to play out the entire Jutland
scenerio. If I\'d kept at it, I guess I\'d be what is known in the hobby as a
Grognard. (sp) However, I haven\'t wargamed now in years.

My friends and I started roleplaying (though we didn\'t call it that) years
before Dungeons & Dragons came out, but I remember the excitement when I
found that little white box in the back of the game store.  I was aware
that TSR was moving to AD&D, but I never bought into it.  Loving science
fiction, I jumped on Traveller like a "duck on a junebug" when it first
came out in 77, and I have most of the CT material, but I never got into
MegaTraveller. The main boxed set wasn\'t good enough to pull me away from
the home-brew I\'d worked up over the years, and the politics of the
rebellion didn\'t interest my players. Frankly, I got a lot more use and
enjoyment out of FGU\'s Aftermath..that system was too hard to play, but it
had some great ideas.  I enjoyed the Tw2k, Space 1899 and Traveller 2300
things, but didn\'t do too much with them.  I stumbled across TNE and was
impressed enough to buy it, and then buy the Deluxe Set that included FFS.
Now there\'s T4, and I\'m *still* busy working on a home-brew system. <g> 

My face-to-face gaming has petered out over years, but my play by email has
taken off.  Today, I\'m involved in 9 PBEM games as player and GM, and I
spend way too much time on them.

> Anyone else care to embarrass themselves?

Sure.  :-)  I\'m a U.S. Navy brat who grew up around the U.S. (Hawaii, San
Diego CA, Washington DC), now residing here in Houston TX.  In college I
spent three years as a Space Physics / Classics major (making me either a
classical physicist, or a physical... nah....).  I found, though, that I
preferred talking about, writing about, and explaining physics over doing
it, so in mid-junior year I leapt over to an English major.  That and
entirely too much theatre kept me in college for six years total.

Recently I\'ve held an assortment of teaching jobs (from fourth to eighth
graders) and technical writing / computer consulting positions.  It\'s sort
of random, but it lets me do theatre in the evenings (I recently finished
a well-recieved collegiate production of Shakespeare\'s THE WINTER\'S TALE,
finally directing in my tenth consecutive year with that festival).

As far as Traveller-relevant expertise goes....  I still know my physics
okay, though not so well as some on the list.  I\'m happy to proofread your
Latin next time you want to print up some Rule of Man Commorative coins....
I stay fairly well-read on the history of the late Roman Republic and
other eras when I can get to them, and try to stay abreast of ongoing
scientific research in a variety of fields.  I own every GDW- and DGP-
produced product (aside from a couple boardgames and JTAS 2 & 4) for CT,
MT, and TNE, plus several from the licensees, and I have an English
major\'s memory for material and detail, so I enjoy playing canon-cop when
I\'m not blithely breaking it myself.  :-)

I prefer historical/cultural/technological threads, and tend to stay out
of rules-discussions, though, since I play GURPS. I think that alone may
make me as much a heretic as Eris Reddoch....

Although, it would be nice if IG came out with an official version of 
space combat so that we can do this.

I\'d like a choice in starship combat.  Maybe one general system (but 
better than the crappy system in Book 1), a system for large scale 
combat with capitol ships and fleets, and a system on a short time 
scale, say 1 minute (or even 6 seconds), so that we could have a blow 
by blow combat system.

Per,

I can call you Per, can\'t I?  :)

Here\'s how I\'ve battled these problems.

First off, I\'ve altered the critical hit rule (the one that says the 
first hit in Traveller is taken randomly against a character\'s 
stats).  

I only allow this when a spectacular success is rolled.  Otherwise, 
you\'re popping off character\'s right and left.  And, my players seem 
to like getting that killing blow in (and very often it is) when they 
roll SS on their to hit throws.

Second off, as far as hit location goes, I use the excellent chart 
developed by Glenn Grant.  You should try it.  He did a good job.

If you want it, contact Glenn or e-mail me, and I\'ll send it to you.

My BS is in Applied Chemistry, from Harvey Mudd College (a tiny
engineering and science school in Claremont, California).  At least one
other person on the list went there, so they seem to be doing something
right, :)  Most of the way through my chem degree program, though, I
discovered that my real love was for programming, not chemistry -- but it
was far too late to hop majors.  So I stuck out the chem program, as part
of which I did my senior research project on wiring up all the lab
instruments to an old LSI-11 that they had gathering dust in a back room.
Suddenly, they could do data plots without sharpening a pencil. :)

After college, I hired on at General Dyanics -- this was 1985, the Cold
War was going full-force, and anybody with something vaguely like an
engineering degree could get a good job with a defense contractor.  At GD,
I did a bunch of cool things, like writing a process-control program for
the plant\'s HVAC system, and an expert system to diagnose problems in the
Phalanx close-in ship defense system.

Later, I moved to Rockwell, where I got heavily involved in various things
too secret to talk about, but involving acoustics and undersea warfare.
*That* was the most fun I\'ve ever had while getting paid for it. :)

A few years back, I moved to my current job with a civilian softwar
company -- the bottom having fallen out of the killin-godless-Commies
market.  These days I write server components in a system that monitors
and automatically troubleshoots large distributed computer networks.  It\'s
intriguing work, but I do miss playing _Red October_ games...

All this time, my chem degree has gone entirely unused, save for
pronouncing cleaning-fluid ingredient names...and answering TML questions.
Guess there *is* a purpose to everything!

It\'s named the missouri archives because back in 1992 it was an FTP site
that I maintained from my workstation. I since had to give that up as it
became more and more popular and ended up transfering all the data into
the Web and created some web pages for Traveller.

    'body' => 'The thread has been dying down, probably with good reason, but I can\'t
resist chucking in my "thoughts" -- I\'ll try to keep it Traveller-relevant,
though.

With regard to sexual/racial/etc. tolerance in the Imperial
Navy/Army/Marines/Scouts, it seems to me that one question to be answered
first off is whether these organizations use segregated units to avoid the
problems inherent in recruiting from c. 11,000 (?) systems and keeping
everyone working together efficiently and so forth.  From what I remember
reading, the Imperial Army sounded like it did incorporate wholesale
brigades drawn from member worlds -- so presumably within a given unit, the
members would all be from a reasonably similiar cultural background.  With
the Navy, Marines, and Scouts, I sort of imagined a much more mixed and
heterogeneous composition of crews and work-units.  In this case, perhaps
one of the criteria in screening prospective recruits would be how well
they can adapt to the standards of the general "Imperial interstellar
culture" (e.g., no psionics, aristocratic rule, racial equality, religious
tolerance, sexual/gender equality (?), etc.)

(In general, I have always assumed a big difference between "Imperial
civilization," a sort of cultural cement holding together the interstellar
military, political, and economic fabric, and the thousands of local
cultures of the member worlds and regions making up the Imperium.)

Someone (forget who, sorry) pointed out that Archduke Norris\' decision not
to marry had significant political implications, given a tradition of
marriages as political alliances.  *If* one takes the point of view that
he\'s gay, this might suggest that the Imperium at least doesn\'t recognize
homosexual marriage -- otherwise, why couldn\'t he have married some
important *male* fellow-aristocrat?  Thin evidence, yeah, but so it goes
for all the rest of the Norris thread, too.

David Golden and "Shade" mentioned sexual orientation and so forth among
non-human sophonts... now there\'s a topic!  It does make a lot of sense to
me that the Aslan would be very down on male homosexuality as an
*orientation*, given how any given instance of it could screw up the social
fabric for so many individuals -- whether this says anything about their
attitude towards *behaviour*, or to female homosexuality, is anyone\'s
guess.  One could easily set up the female corporations, particularly the
non-clan aligned ones, as some sort of Aslan lesbian separatist subculture.
Given the way that Aslan assign gender to humans in terms only of their
own "male" vs "female" social roles, without reference to a human\'s
biological sex, they probably see humans as totally sexually
indiscriminate.

With the Vargr, it\'s occurred to me that if they act much like their canine
forebears, and given what we\'re told about their \'pack mentality\', they
might display a lot of dominance/submission behaviour that could look
sexual in nature to human observers, but which might not be regarded as
such by the Vargr themselves.

How about the other major species?  Droyne reproduction I see as
dispassionate, instictive, and insectile; probably the Hiver don\'t "get"
the idea of sex at all (but are probably horrifically curious about it).

Er, just to stand up for the social scientists -- all the studies I\'ve seen
on genetic conditioning of homosexuality have been by medical scientists,
not social scientists of any persuasion.  So to speak.

	Yes, but Aliens with social and cultural structures that are not

20 years).  Alien, you bet.  Incomprehensible, no way.

	If a race subscribes to some darwinistic/sociobiological
worldview, homosexuality could be viewed as disfunctional.  Such
individuals may be looked on differently by Aliens, and depending on the
severity of the view, this could seriously colour their perceptions.  It
is bad enough to be a furless ape, but to be a *deviant* furless ape....

	They are different, but not wholly "alien" (beyond comprehension).
It may make no difference to the Aslan (I only remember bits over the
years), but it *could* depending on their worldview (something the aliens
would fall into).


	Laterish!

	Problem is, the two are significantly different. In fact, there are even
different definitions of wet-displacement tons.	But usually they
approximate to the volume of one ton (metric, short, long, Imperial, you
take your pick) of water, while a Traveller disp ton is one ton of liquid
hydrogen. There\'s a factor of 14 there--1 (metric) ton of water is 1 m^3,
while 1 (metric) ton of LH2 is 14 m^3.

	There\'s no need for a really detailed database. First-order orbital
calculations require only six numbers to completely describe an orbit. That
ain\'t very much. Furthermore, I don\'t need to store all known solar systems

	Another explanation I heard: Picture realspace as the surface of the
earth. Takes a while to travel along the surface. Now drill a tunnel
straight from point A to point B, and drop in. Quicker.

	And, this is the real kicker, apparently somebody fiddling around with
chord tunnels found out that, in Real Life (modelled theoretically), if you
travel through such a tunnel by falling under gravity, it takes the same
length of time no matter HOW far apart the endpoints are. If it\'s a
straightline tunnel between any two surface points, in a vacuum, you get
from one end to the other in the same time whether A and B are 1,000 miles
or 4,000 miles apart.

	Sounds like "Jump always takes 1 week," doesn\'t it.

Many many years ago (early 80s, perhaps?), somebody wrote two or three
stories for Analog in a universe like this.  We made first contact with
extraterrestrial intelligence when a wooden spacecraft came sliding down
over Los Angeles, landed in the quad at UCLA, and disgorged a few dozen
short furry humanoid warriors armed with pole-axes and arquebusses,
intent on conquering the world.  The LAPD Riot Squad successfully
contained this alien invasion within an hour or so.

It turned out that the (linked) secrets of gravitic propulsion and FTL
travel were so mind-bogglingly simple, so utterly *obvious*, that nearly
every intelligent species stumbled across them somewhere around the late
bronze age.  Only humanity and one other species had been so cursed by
Murphy that they managed to miss out.

Anyone remember titles or author for these, and whether they\'ve been
collected somewhere?  I\'ve always just loved the idea...and it would make
for a truly strange game!

The vacuum and high temperature variations of space would tend to cook
volatiles out of the wood at a really horrifying pace, leaving it warped,
brittle, and quite possibly not air-tight. You\'d want to re-tar the hull
every time you made port, keep *lots* of emergency sealant aboard, and
discard hulls after about 3 years (tops) of use in space.

What\'s the handwaving behind having only one of the two?  Or is it just

    'body' => 'Seeing as everyone is presenting their versions of how jumpdrives work, I
thought I\'d throw my 2 credits into the pot.

Jumpdrive components

    1.  Jump Field Projector Coil - Mounted on the bow of a ship, the
        coil projects a field that surrounds the ship from bow to
        stern.
            
    2.  Field Collector Ring - Mounting around the stern of a ship,
        the ring pinches closed the field projected by the bow coil.

    3.  Gravitational Sensors - Mounting at the bow of the ship, the
        sensors detect distant gravitation sources through the
        projected gravity lens.  The quality of the ship\'s sensors
        is the primary limit of a ship\'s "jump range."
        
    4.  Gravitational Pulse Generator - Mounted at the center of the
        coil, the pulse generator fires a pulse of anti-gravitons
        through the gravity lens linking the ship with a distant
        gravity source.  This forms a "forward probability wave"
        that the ship will ride on.
        
    5.  Lanthium Jump Grid - Embedded in the hull of the ship, the
        lanthium grid maintains a bubble of coherent space around
        and within the ship protecting it from dissipation during the
        jump period.
        
    6.  Jump Fuel - This is a quantity of matter injected through
        the jump coil after the jump field has formed.  This
        injection matter must be of sufficient mass (~10% of the
        ship\'s volume in H2) to form a gravitational lens at the bow
        of the ship with a diameter larger than the ship\'s width and
        height. 
        
Jumpdrive Process

    1.  The Lanthium grid is energized.  The grid must remain under
        power until the ship returns to normal space in roughly one
        week.  The grid requires approximately 30 seconds to come up
        to full strength, and is characterized by a glowing pattern
        projected on the surface of the hull armor.

    2.  Energy is fed to the bow coil from the main power plant
        causing the jump field to form around the ship.  The field
        requires < 10e-12 seconds to form, and must be closed at the
        ship\'s stern by the ring collector or it will immediately
        collapse.  From inside and outside the field, the ship seems
        be within a shimmering translucent eggshell.
        
    3.  The ship\'s location within the field, outside the lanthium
        grid, becomes indeterminate with equal probability at all
        points.  If the grid fails the ship will be reduced to a sea
        of quarks in an energy sea filling the space within the
        jumpfield.
        
  If no other action is taken, the jump field will collapse within
  10e-6 seconds, and the ship will emerge at it\'s former location.
        
    5.  Jump fuel is rapidly pumped through the coil into the jump
        field retarding the collapse of the jump field, and
        providing the energy required for jump.  To enable a ship to
        successfully "jump" the quantity of mass must equal no less
        than 8% of the ship\'s volume in H2, and depending on its
        elemental makeup could require as much as 15%.  This appears
        as shifting colors and patterns from within the ship with
        the colors and patterns coming from the elemental makeup of
        the injected mass.  From the outside, the ship appears to be
        a multi-colored shimmering bubble.  The geometry of the coil
        causes the matter to collect more densely at the bow forming
        a gravitational lens in front of the ship.  After 30 seconds
        of injection this lens becomes clear to gravitational
        sensors.  The lens will remain intact for the duration of
        the matter injection, and that can be extended for up to 2
        minutes, then it will lose coherence and dissolve as the
        injection matter begins to be destroyed by the jump field.
        At this point, if not before, the ship loses all
        communication with the outside and seemingly winks out of
        existence.  It will take approximately one week for this
        quantity of mass to be dissipated, and allow the ship to
        wink back into existence.

    6.  During the time the gravitational lens is coherent the
        passive gravitational sensors can pick up *stellar* sized
        gravity targets at multi-parsec ranges through the lens.
        The gravity sources are projected into the astrogation tank
        where the astrogator quickly matches them against charted
        positions, locates the appropriate target and locks the
        pulse generator on that target.  The quality (Tech Level) of
        the sensors determines the range at which gravity sources
        can be imaged, an hence locked onto.
        
    7.  The Astrogator uses the Pulse Generator to fire a stream of
        anti-gravitons at the selected target, being careful to
        ensure the gravitational lens has grown broad enough to
        allow the ship to pass though.  Firing the anti-gravitons
        the jump field is instantaneously linked from the ship to
        the target and the entire field\'s location immediately
        becomes indeterminate as it seems to be sucked through the
        lens.  At this point, the ship and the field surrounding it
        don\'t appear to exist anywhere in this universe, one theory
        is that the ship exists in a separate dimension called jump
        space, but that is only a theory, in truth we simply don\'t
        know where the ship is.  From the outside, the shimmering
        eggshell simply winks out of existence.  From the inside,
        the gravitational lens collapses back around the ship and
        the walls of the jump field turn into a mindbending and
        indescribable hell in the wink of an eye.  If viewports
        haven\'t already been closed and dogged, they will be now!
        
    8.  After approximately one week the injected matter has
        dissipated to the point where it can no longer maintain the
        walls of the jump field and the ship winks back into
        existence in normal space.  If the grav pulse hit its target
        the ship will have ridden a "forward probability wave" and
        emerge at the "hyperlimit" of that gravity source, this is
        approximately 150 diameters from the center of a gravity
        source.  If the grav pulse was fired wildly or missed it\'s
        target the ship will still "ride the wave", but will emerge
        *elsewhere*, misjumps of this nature could put a ship anywhere
        within 36 parsecs of the originating system.  If the grav
        pulse was not fired, there will be no "forward probability
        wave" to ride and the ship will emerge at the exact location
        from which it jumped.
        
Jump Limitations

  Coils may be energized creating jump fields anywhere, but there
  are a number of limitations.

    1.  Within an atmosphere a jump field will attempt to surround
        the entire volume of the atmosphere, causing it to collapse
        immediately with no effect other than the loss of the energy
        pumped into the coil as heat.  This has a decidedly bad
        effect on the jump coil.
        
    2.  Jump fields may be formed within 100 diameters of a planet
        or stellar gravity source, but the view through the lens
        will be obscured by the nearby gravity source and the
        Astrogator will be unable to locate a target for the grav
        pulse.  Firing the pulse will result in an unpredictable
        result, the ship may emerge in a week at the local stellar
        "hyperlimit", but it also may emerge *elsewhere*.
        
    3.  Between 100 and 150 diameters of a planet or stellar gravity
        source there will be improving views through the lens
        reaching maximum clarity at about 150 diameters.  Beyond 150
        there is no improvement.  
        
  Lesser quantities and unrefined Jump Fuel can be injected through
  the coils, but there are problems with this.
  
    1.  Smaller quantities of jump fuel will cause the lens to be
        too narrow, and if the ship can\'t fit through the lens it
        will leave the parts that don\'t fit behind where they are
        destroyed.  If the part left behind includes the lanthium
        grid, the entire ship dissolves into a sea of quarks.
        
    2.  Engineers tune the coil to maximize the formation of the
        lens by analyzing the elemental properties of the jump fuel
        before it is injected.  Pure mono-hydrogen is the easiest to
        deal with and is preferred.  Less pure fuel can be used
        successfully, if the Engineer can accurately record it\'s
        component elements and produce a well-controlled injection
        plan.  This becomes increasingly hard as fuel becomes less
        pure.  Unrefined jump fuel, ie containing a mix of elements,
        is dangerous, and un-controlled injection of unrefined fuel
        is deadly.
        

Whew!  That was a long post.  If you made it this far you must be
interested.  ;-> I know this isn\'t *everybodies* jump drive, but it is the
one I plan to use.  If you have questions, or see obvious holes please let
me know.

Having not been a party to the Cold War, and having a friendly superpower

None, other than leased bandwidth on others\' birds.  Of course, there are
plenty of high-tech countries that haven\'t much of a space program, either
- -- Australia, Taiwan, South Africa...  Space travel is just an optional
piece of the big technology picture.

That I know of:

- - Advancements in offshore oil drilling technology allowing cheaper and
less environmentally threatening access to petroleum under the Gulf of
Mexico.

- - Development of highly efficient and redundant power generation and
distribution infrastructure, using new ideas in power-net management.

- - Improvements in manufacturing process technology at maquiladora plants
in the northern part of the country.

Yes, I\'m forming a very clear picture...that you have an odd idea of
Mexico. ;)

I think it\'s well-nigh certain that such a "universal ephemeris" program
would be available on every starship in the Imperium.  You just need to
store six numbers for every body, plus some reference info about what
system it\'s in and so forth, to get a workable model that\'ll be good for
years to decades into the future.  I\'ll bet the database for a sector-wide
UE, good down to individual planetary satellites and large asteroids (say,
about a million individual objects), plus the program itself (relatively
tiny), would be well under a gigabyte...small enough, in other words, to
fit onto a current desktop machine with room to spare. 

Speaking of positional uncertainty in jumps, I\'ve always thought that
there should be some, but not enough to cause huge problems.  The first
instinct is to borrow +-10% from the interval, but missing by 0.2
parsecs on a 2-parsec trip puts you a bit far from your landing point. :)
My next though was to relate it into the trip time, and lightspeed.

A jump takes 7ish days.  7 days at c is around 1200 AU.  Assume jump
uncertainty spreads at c from around your target point, using the same
+-10%, and you get a 120 AU range -- still too big.  But I can\'t help
feeling that c and the time uncertainty *do* play into this.  Anybody want
to pick this up?

I wonder sometimes if I\'m bringing too much of  my work home. My background
is space surveillance -- using groundbased visible and infrared sensors,
and even lasers to "detect, track, and  identify" (to quote the mission
statement) objects in space, first in the Air Force (Capt. USAFR ret.) and
now as a contractor (it pays better). My speciality is signature analysis,
recognizing and monitoring the status of satellites too far away to image
from the variations in their total brightness. I\'ve acquired some expertise
in orbital mechanics, sensors, and computer programing. Along the way, I
picked up a couple of master\'s degrees and a PhD in astronomy. My primary
astronomy interest is asteroids and recently have been working on Earth
approaching asteroids (the old TML "dropping rocks" problem). 

I have a suggestion. Rather than the short descriptions we have been
providing, why don\'t we prepare short Traveller-style bios (ala Capt.
Alexander Jamison). The IG tests for determing UPPs were published here a
few months ago. We could all become NPCs in each other\'s games. Who knows,
someone might be interested in collecting the bios into a NPC booklet. I
think we\'re at least as interesting as some I\'ve seen.  Look for my bio at
my "Misjump" web site in a few weeks.

Just out of curiousity, what type of ballistic weapon would be

bunch of people describing their life stories (or at least their
professional stories) and it just looked like too much fun to be left out
of.

     I\'m currently 22 years old, and am a English major at Pomona College
(a tiny but well-respected Liberal Arts school located about 6 blocks from
Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California), but as of May 18th I will
be a graduate in search of work, which I hope to find in the LA area,
possibly in some way connected to the film industry.
    I was born and raised in Evansville, Indiana, a small city that has a
disproportionately large gaming population (among others, Jean Rabe
(editor of JTAS) is from Evansville, Kevin Knight (editor of Traveller
Chronicle) is from Henderson, KY-- right across the Ohio River, Guy
McLimore(sp?) and Greg Pohelin (authors of the FASA Star Trek and Dr Who
rpgs) are locals, and I could probably go on further).  I began gaming
(with Basic D&D, of course) when I was in 3rd grade with a friend who\'s
brother played, and over the next couple of years I gradually acquired the
same gaming circle that, with a few changes around the edges, has remained
intact ever since.
    I first got interested in Traveller when MT was released, on the
recommendation of some of the older members of the gaming club I was a
member of at the time, and although it took me literally years to get the
hang of the rules, I loved the background and sci-fi feel, and it wasn\'t
long before I was hounding cons and used book-stores trying to buy up as
much CT stuff as possible (note: 10 years later, still looking for JTAS 1,
3-5, Mayday, Adv 8, Alien Module 5, Alien Realms, Atlas..., and a lot of
licensee stuff-- otherwise I\'ve got it all!)  I didn\'t like the rules or
the background of TNE, but I had loyalty to the trademark and Dave, Frank,
and Loren always seemed so enthusiastic about it at GenCon, that I bought
most of the books anyway, though I almost never played.
    For the past few years, especially now that we only get together on
shared breaks from school (none of my gaming-group friends go to school
with me) we\'ve been pretty much exclusively playing "RuneQuest" (which I\'m
sure makes me an oddity-- my two favorite games had passed their peak
of popularity before I had ever even heard of rpgs), but we have had a
couple of pretty successful one-off attempts at T4 and I have hopes to do
a little more of the same this summer.   After that, I\'m not sure what
will happen, but I have hopes that I can find some folks willing to play
Traveller when I finally get myself settled.

Thanks for listening,

No, it isn\'t. I figured that once the patients were in the low berth, 
there\'d be no reason to speed anymore...

Now that you mention it, though, there should be *some* compensation. I 
guess I should add a standard 3G compensator for the module.

Oooo! Oooo! I do! Harry Turtledove...but before he was Harry Turtledove,
don\'t ask me what his alias was though.

About 6 months ago I went through my Analog collection searching for the
these darn stories...I found *one*, "The Road Less Travelled", but I think
there were a couple more set in the same universe.

An interesting idea from the story was that discovering a technology set
that gave a culture cheap, easy anti-grav and FTL stunted their development
at TL1, 2, and 3, so they never developed the technologies and basic theory
that lead to all the advances we humans developed by the late 20th century
when we were invaded by guys with muskets and wooden ships.  "The Road Less
Travelled" takes place several hundred years later after humans cut a
swatch through the galactic arm, break up into small pocket empires and go
into a dark age.  A small government with some of the "old" technology
sends a scout out to investigate missing ships where he discovers the
Vargr..well, canine-ish beings that are about as advanced as humans were
when we captured the FTL technology, and *much* more aggressive and
organized than the assorted human empires.  He escapes from them and
accidentally succeeds in destroying the squadron they send in pursuit. His
bosses are happy that these new players will think we humans are tough
enough to take out a squadron with a single ship, but worried that we won\'t
be prepared for these guys when they finally do come. So, while our scout
tries to sneak off the base they are preparing to order him to go back
and....<g>  Hey! I remember it pretty good!

Quantum tunneling. <g> Transister and MOS technology depend on quantum
tunneling for much of their effectiveness.  I postulate that gravity
control works at the quantum level by altering the vacuum fluctuations and
thereby altering gravitational and inertial forces.  This kind of tinkering
with the ZPF produces the side-effect of raising the resistance to quantum
tunneling in nearby microelectronic devices. This increases heating and
lowers the MTBF for these devices.  So, in practice MOS and CMOS devices
work, but burn out within a few days of going online.  Discrete transisters
last for a few weeks. Vacuum tubes turn out to be more reliable and
cheaper.  The over all effect is larger, slower, more expensive
electronics.  It doesn\'t mean no computers or display terminals. It does
mean no cyberwear. ;->

What I\'ve been thinking of is, how much power does it really take? I
haven\'t found anything in the books about it, so I suppose it\'s GM\'s
choice, but I don\'t like making a basic part of the shipconstruction a
GM choice...

Sure is, the thing is that T4 doesn\'t support hitlocations which is the
most important thing I want, so that damage that ripped the arm of would
be evenly distributed all over the body. Or if we take another example:
A right handed PC gets shot (not very badly) in the right arm. This
would probably mean that the PC could not fire his weapon due to the
pain, but using the standard system you can work just perfectly (if the
damage is placed correctly) until you drop down unconcious.

Evidence that Norris is/was gay:
      He didn\'t marry
      He had a very close relationship (indeterminant nature) with another man
By any standards very slim, but I\'ll work with the proposition; though it could
just as easily indicate a slighlty misogynistic confirmed batchelor or a
myriad of
other possibilities.

Now in an interview, Norris questioned on why he hadn\'t married gave a rather
non commital response. If one assumes that Norris was gay, this would
indicate that
open homosexuality isn\'t acceptable in the Imperium in 1100. However since
Emperor Strephon suggested that he clone himself to produce an heir, indicating
that the Emperor was aware that he was gay (assuming of course that he was) and
that he accepted this as not being a problem. So from this **very** slim
evidence
I would propose that homosexuality in the 3rd Imperium was recognised and
accepted in private, just so long as the people in question remained
discrete about it.
Sort of like the US militaries currrent "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" policy. Well
it gives some
good roleplaying possibilities anyway; the Imperium\'s run by middle of the road
liberals, could explain why it fell apart so quickly :*>

      <Andrew mounts his soapbox>
And to those people (gay, straight, bi or otherwise) who regard this issue
as being
something deadly serious. Please lighten up, it\'s just a game, half the fun
is in creating
and working with different socialogical situations. When you get beaten up
for walking
hand in hand with your boy/girlfriend in the real world, that\'s serious. You
know
you really don\'t need heros to feel secure; nor do you need to make the private
affairs of others into a menace to society. I play traveller to escape the
real world
nd to have fun with different worlds, and I really think it rather silly to
catergorise
people by just one aspect of their personality (I blame that on new math and
all those
damn sets personally :*> ).

Kenneth, that\'s the typical american outlook / worldview  again. Just 
because another country can\'t afford finanially to build expensive 
technologies doesn\'t mean they can\'t! They are not of a different 
Tech Level, but rather financially underequipped to afford the higher 
level. Why would they NEED to build a high tech jet military fighter? 
Feed the people first, raise their standard of living, create jobs. 
Then you can thinkl about upgrading your airforce (however, even 
then, it would be a waste of money!). They don\'t need a space 
program. It\'s ridiculous to think that every country on the planert 
needs its own little space program! The current situation is 
horrifying. Why can\'t the spacefaring countries (US, Europe, Japan 
and Russia maybe) create a unified space organization funded by all. 
It would be much more cost effecrtive than the national programms 
today. 
Just because a country can\'t afford as many research labs to make 
technological breakthroughs as it\'s big neighbor does, that doesn\'t 
mean that it\'s on a different technological level entirely. Give them 
the financial possibility and they will have the same capacity!

first Traveller product I have ever owned, but I am very impressed with it
so far (though there are a lot of annoying typos/ommisions that will no
doubt be ironed out for the 2nd printing).=20
I\'m 25 years old, live in Winchester which is a city in Hampshire in the
south of England. I\'ll be using my own version of the Imperium background
for my games, just see how it develops I think. So far I have T4 books 1 and=
 3.=20

enough for now,

But can WoTC be trusted with *any* RPG\'s these days. They had a range of
products which were not making profits. They sold them/gave them away so
that they could concentrate on CCG\'s. At the time PA at WoTC said that he
felt \'wotc cannot offer rpg lines the development they deserve\' or words to
that effect. Why has this suddenly changed?
Now i\'m hoping that wotc will just trim off some of the surplus t$r lines
and take AD&D back to its roots, but then again maybe they will just strip
the assets and sell a range of new CCG\'s. Only time will tell.

Well that is not exactly true. I have never had any of the previous
Traveller products, but T4 grabbed my attention enough to buy it. I think
that the time is right for a good quality SF game to come onto the market,
what is the competition out there? There is no reason why T4 cannot become a
real alternative to D&D as the first rpg kids buy, and also appeal to
older/mature rpg\'ers.

Hm, with TL15+ medicine available to him, even his *surgeons* would never
know...

Ahem.  My suggestion was, obviously, flippant, but the appeal of it is
growing on me.  As a solutions to the question of Norris\' sexual identity
go, it\'s certainly likely to confuse the Aslan even *more*, as well as
irritate players who aren\'t interested in the topic.

Norris and his aide, Vargr in heat, and other fun stuff,
let\'s open the floor to other reproducively-related subjects:


Non-biological Aslan
   Aslan define themselves by culture, not by species. Anyone
who abides by Aslan culture is part of "the people," whatever
their DNA says (and in some cases, it isn\'t even DNA). One 
obvious example are the Solomani humans who became Clan Zodia.
Less well known are other human and alien Minor Races within
Aslan space that have adopted Aslan culture.

One of the marks of Traveller Aliens(tm) is the Pushmepullyou
of "culture is separate from biology, but is often strongly
informed by biology." In the Aslans\' case, the proper
roles of females and males is influenced by their 3:1
female:male birth ratio. So what happens when humans
(with a 1:1 ratio) adopt Aslan culture on a large scale,
like Clan Zodia. (Individuals could make individual
sacrifices, but large groups would have to find ways
of institutionalizing those sacrifices so that it can
continue to function, even exist, as a coherent unit.)
Human clans are stuck with extra sons.

What about inter-clan marraiges? Allied Aslan clans
may inter-marry to strenghten bonds, so what happens
when one clan is not biologically aslan? Do political
marraiges still take place? And does the Aslans\'
intricate codes of behavior include mandates about
marital "duties" for husbands and wives? <wince>.

    'body' => 'There\'s a line in one of the Traveller Digest\'s \'In
Defense of...\' articles (the \'...Lucan\' one) that 
states in effect that every imaginable sexual practice --
including abstinence -- is considered immoral SOMWHERE
within the vast expanses of the Imperium.

OK, most of us won\'t be delving into the sexual politics
of the Imperium too deeply in our campaigns. The closest
I came is in one of the short scenarios in The Traveller 
Adventure, the one where the young lady from a poor 
mining family entered into a surrogate-mother contract
(the fine print of which also required her to act as
a concubine) and she bargains with the PC\'s to help here 
get out of it (big reminder: the Imperium is about commerce, 
not individual rights). Aside from that, there was just 
all those times my players failed their Carousing rolls
after nights in Seedy Space-Ranger Bars and woke up in
ambiguous but very embarrasing situations... .

However, some of the strong feelings people have
expressed in the \'gay\' threads is directly applicable
to much more common Traveller situations:

Negative attitudes and stereotypes that exist in the
real world about gays very closely parallel Imperial
attitudes towards Psionics: that it\'s a perverted aberration
that violates the natural sanctity of one\'s own mind!
They want to hump your BRAIN! AND YOUR KIDS\' BRAIN!

Seriously, most of the time PC\'s (or at least mine) treated 
psionics lightly, as if having psions around (or being one)
was just another tool, like having a big honking FGMP-15.
The FGMP can be controlled easily by Law Level, but
psi was more ambiguous, and too often fell through the
cracks. If you\'re using psionics in your game, make the
players feel that prejudice, feel like the gay guy at
a Jimmy Swaggert revival(or just afterward, in a dark
corner of the parking lot)[or in more intense cases, like
a jew at a Nuremburg rally]. Make them understand that
they\'re playing with fire to have anything to do with
psionics. It adds loads more tension to ANY scenario
with a psionics connection.

This applies in ANY milieu. While it\'s most applicable to
the Classic (and therefore post-Supressions) Imperium,
a certain paranoia about uncertain, unseeable powers
will exist earlier (M:0, M:200, etc.) which the
Supressions tap into to be so (overly-)successful. 
Likewise a lingering prejudice based on strongly
internalized values in a post-Imperial (TNE) setting.

Separate, but related to this, is the prospect of 
segregation in the Imperial armed forces.  Some
segregation exists in the case of non-humans for
sheer, biologically-driven logistical purposes.
Since it is not a role of the Imperial military
to act as an assimilating, homogenizing influence,
there will be cases where local prejudices (against
women, against men, against aliens, against gays, 
against people who bathe regularly, against people who
don\'t bathe regularly, against certain hair lengths,
against people who think premarital sex is immoral,
against people who think post-pubescent abstinence is 
perverted, etc. ad nauseum) are enough to impede unit 
efficiencey if they\'re all tossed together, but not 
enough to justify excluding them from Imperial service.

Might the command structure wink at segregating units
along some general social lines? Might there be all-male
or all-female units for people who just can\'t accept
orders from the other sex? Or maybe sex-segregated
units are the norm, but there are certain mixed units
for people from worlds where, socially, that is important
for any number of reasons. Unofficial segregation based
on local prejudices might have added to the "regional
loyalty" problems in the Rebellion Era.

Whatever the reason, your players might just encounter elements
of the 33214th Imperial Marines, The Amazons, composed 100%
of human females for whatever reason the GM sees fit. ;)

Silly question. Will the 3d sailor return to his starting point?

I just thought of a couple of interesting side effects of the "pusher" drive.

1. you\'ll sometimes want to change which body you are pushing on.
2. The last ditch defense against boarding is to push on the ship
   that\'s trying to close. But if you use two ship\'s boats, they can\'t
   push on both at once. And in any case, if they have more Gs than
   you, they can "reverse push" (pull) on you harder than you can push
   them away. :-)

Outside the cities, most of Mexico is about TL1, if not TL0. Little

Well, I don\'t have a degree. I ran out of money before I could finish
my AA in Computer Programming/Computer Operations. I\'ve got around 25
years programming experience ranging from FORTRAN and RPG II, to Pascal
and several assemblers.

I\'ve been a voracious reader of science and science fiction. I was
correcting the teachers as far back as 6th grade. :-)

I also have some metal and woodworking experience (very oudated) and
remember enough electronics to get myself in trouble. I\'ve worked for a
company that produced silicon wafers and picked up a lot of different
things there. I also used to fly model rockets, and I\'ve been involved
with the Society for Creative Anachronism on and off for about 25 years
(so I do have some idea what low tech societies can do, as well as *how*).

Oh yeah, I used to be an amateur chemist. I collected info on how to
make things that go "boom".

Bruce,

Better refigure your argument. Remember, both KE and momentum are
*vector* quantities. The ship pushing on the star gives the star an
equal KE and momentum, but in the opposite direction. Total is *zero*.

The ship pushing on it\'s exhaust works the same way, *except* that it
only pushes on a given "piece" of exhaust once. 

Either way things balance, but the multiple pushes greatly decreases
the *efficiency* of the "push on the star" drive.

We went through this (with equations and calculations) about two weeks
back in rec.arts.sf.science.

I read "A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!" when it was serialized in
Analog. The accompanying illos had a sort of small steam engine hitched
to the carriages, and controlled by reins!

Some will be like New York. The ones on *really* low tech worlds will
be more like Sanctuary *outside* the "fence". Inside, there will be
high tech, but only as needed.

You might check out a few of the Darkover books for a another example
of a port on a "low tech"<grin> world.

Heck, Darkover would be a lovely trick to pull on your players. An
"obviously medieval" world, with this silly law known as "The Compact"
which forbids the use of any weapon that works beyond arms reach. The
Terrans thought it was "quaint". Right up until they learned the *hard
way* why the law existed. Seems that Darkover has a high tecnology
after all. Psi based. And when someone unearths one of the old,
outlawed weapons, there\'s hell to pay. But on the bright side, after
that the Terrans are *more* than willing to help enforce the Compact. :-)

Oh, the weapon? Think of it as a psi-based PGMP sized to roast
*cities*. The Darkovans had *damned* good reasons for outlawing much
of their own technology.

No point kidnapping Einstein. He\'s not *that* useful for nuclear work
(our program made very little use of him), and he\'s no good for the
rocket program.

You have the one thing needed to "fix" the German nuclear program.
Someone (von Gotterdmmerung) who gets the theory right, and who
(hopefully) *won\'t* make the error in reducing the data from an
experiment that led the Germans in *our* world to believe that nuclear
*bombs* were impossible. Likewise, I don\'t think that you *really* need
Goddard, as von Braun and company were pretty good, and you have von
Gotterdammerung to help them.

And it will help if the V2 is fitted with a proximity detonator rather

By that time in *our* time line they were almost ready for a test, and

In our world Clarke was merely a *technician*.

In the later stages, you grossly neglect rocket *planes*. We got into
those after the war, and eventually got to the X-15, at which point the
Air Force was *ordered* to let NASA and the Apollo program do things.

In your timeline the successful Komet and Natter, plus some of the
other things the Germans would have come up with would ensure that the
US was following both the "manned missile" *and* the "fly into orbit"
paths. 

And given Yeager\'s position, he\'d be flying an uprated X-15 or DynaSoar
type vehicle. I\'d expect the army to be going for the "missile" path,
the Air Force to be going for the rocketplanes, and the Navy to be
messing with both.

In our timeline the Navy launched several Viking rockets (US design
based on the V2) from ships. And if Heinlein was in anything
*approaching* his "preferred" posting, he\'d be attached to the Navy\'s
space effort. Probably arguing for rocket planes.

Hmm, actually, it would take quite a lot.  Damara just told me that
she worked on a woman who almosy had an arm blown off by a slug from
a shotgun.  I don\'t know whether it was a 00 buchshot  slug, or a
true full-bore slug.  She said the arm was hanging on by
"hamburger."

Unfortunately it continued through her arms and got her head, she
didn\'t make it.

Off hand, I\'d say that it would have to hit a bone, and it should be
a big bullet since it\'s gonna be a through and through hit on
something like an arm

	Well, IIRC, "gotterdammerung" is German for "apocalypse", "von"
indicates landed gentry, and Siegfried was the hero of the Ring Cycle, no?
I chose it for the sort of over-the-top cheezy propagandistic B-movie
villain ring it had; I thought it sounded exactly like what a Nazi mad
scientist out of some bad 1950\'s American pulp-SF novel would be named.

	So basically, the answer to your riddle is that this Canadian came
up with this particular wierd "german" name deliberately, with satirical
intent :).

Come again?  I\'m not aware of any state-of-the-art silicon fabs in Mexico,
and I\'m pretty certain Gateway still assembles all their computers in their
big plant in South (North?) Dakota.  There might be a board assembly plants
in Mexico, but that\'s the "middleware" of computer hardware manufacture.

I might say the same of you...

In Trav terms, how much of a planet\'s TL has to do with the best tech it\'s
imported or created, vs the living conditions (mortality, literacy,
disease, life expectancy, roads, communications, etc.) for the bulk of its
people?

Hmmm.  I went to Pitzer for a year, back in 1979.  Had a _great_ time, but

Nothing against the school, but most of the psychobiology majors were way

Ok.... after weeks of making reference to this material I finally went 
and dug it up ( Just a note to the wise: When your girlfriend breaks up 
and moves out on you and she volunteers to clean your apt before she 
goes.... SAY NO! ).  It was written by Mark Metlay and was made 
available on this mailing list on Mar 10, 1993. ( Does that get me any 
longevity awards? ) I made a hard copy of it and thats all I have 
available. Its an eight page essay on Vargr and Aslan sexual practices, 
anatomy, and so forth.

And I quote from the Aslan section " Homosexuality is essentially 
nonexistent between males, for a number of reasons, chief among them the 
lack of appropriate nerve endings in the rectum and a lack of necessary 
odor cues.  On the other hand, homosexual relations between females are 
extremely common, perhaps more common than heterosexual relations in the 
light of the 4:1 female to male ratio in the Aslan."  Later it goes on to 
note that the male Aslan found male homosexuality to be a dishonorable 
act.
	However, I suppose with enough of a tolerance skill and a belief 
that the human barbarians are liable to do anything could make up for all 
that.  Any opinions?

Yes, I\'d be very interested in seeing the figure on just how much energy
is needed for a ship of X mass and Y velocity.  So long as you can reach
speeds of over a hundred kps in system travel times aren\'t that bad. 

So, just how large a power plant would be needed to take a 1000 ton (mass
not displacement) scout ship to 100 or 200 kps?  If its not *too* much
above 50-100 MW we\'re in business.  I\'d do it myself, but my physics days
ended 15 years ago. 

I see no reason why Thrusters need to be useful for gaining relativistic
speeds (and several reasons why they shouldn\'t).

The IMI Desert Eagle .50 has a muzzle energy of about 1800J.  This will take
off an arm if the bone is hit directly.

Pretty much.  I didn\'t complain about the endless task system
discussion/rant/chest-beating, I just deleted the messages I wasn\'t
interested in, and went on.  Same thing when we got into detailed discussion
of Age of Sail tactics.. I wasn\'t interested, so I skipped it.

Sorry if you feel this is off-topic, but some people clearly find the
discussion of how Imperial society reacts to such issues as homosexuality
relavent.

They tend to come in two categories: dead before you hit the ground, and
lingering for days.

The problem with modeling gunshot damage for a RPG is that so much of what
happens depends on the mental state of the victim.  A trained soldier
running on an andreniline rush, might not notice the shrapnel wounds in his
arm, while a robbery victim might die from being hit in the ass by a .22
pistol round.

To model this in T4, I\'ve changed the "vitals hit" from being a deliberate
attempt to any hit that exceeds the target number by 5 or 9.  A character at
short range is going to have a better chance of putting one into the vitals
(reflected by the higher target number), than a PC 100m away.

I\'m still working on my wounding rules, but here is a quick and dirty look
at how wounds get worse over time.

Superficial Wounds: PC will lose an additional point of damage every 30
minutes until treated.

Minor Wounds: PC loses 1pt/15 minutes until treated.  When conscious, the PC
must make an Average Endurance task to perform any strenous act, or pass out.

Serious Wounds: PC loses 1/5 minutes until treated.  Even if PC regains
wakes up, s/he will be unable to more than talk, and will require a Formid:
Int task to remember a particular piece of information.

Treatment in this case is a sucessful First Aid task, starting with Easy for
Superficial, and going up one difficulty level for each wound level thereafter.

Sure, why not.

I have a degree in physics, with concentrations in computational methods
and economics from Harvey Mudd College.  After that, I went to Claremont
Graduate School for a math degree, which was focussed on PDEs, numerical
analysis, and mathematical modelling.  I paid for the above by writing a
Macintosh Finite Element analysis program on mac/vax for one of the
professors.

I spent a year after that doing image processing, OCR, and chaos analysis
for a few people, and then went to Berkeley for an operations
research/industrial engineering degree.

Since them, I have done some contract work on digital mapping, and for the
last four years have been writing Windows (gack) and Mac (hee hee) software
in C++ for an econometric and forecasting software company in Irvine.

Anyone associated with software developers in Irvine, give me a call :)
(Sorry, am jobhunting, and I fear I slipped into resume mode.)

I have some exposure to the martial arts, but was never terribly good at
it, and am slowly starting to become a decent guitarist.  Oh, I and two
friends wrote a novel based on our RuneQuest game.  Like every one of those
I have heard of, it is better off forogtten, or at least not read.  Was
fun, though.

How\'s that for someone who likes to change fields?

Don\'t blame *this* one on Americans!  First, I\'m pretty sure that RDR is
Canadian (and we don\'t take responsibility for *anything* they do), and
second when we do make up German names we just follow Wanger\'s lead...<g>
OTOH, I will admit Siegfried von Gotterdammerung is a *little* over the
top, but pretty appropriate given the history.

You are right about that, in hind-sight, but there are two possible reasons
the Nazis might try to grab Einstein:  1) They *think* he would be useful
to their nuclear program, and 2) They think he would be useful to *our*
nuclear program.  I believe they would want to deny him to the Allied side
more than anything, and that being the case they would have assassinated
him, not kidnapped him.  So, I propose..

Goddard was assassinated not kidnapped, but this alerted the FBI that
American scientists might be a target for Nazi agents.  The attempt
,several weeks later, to kill Einstein came on a street outside Columbia
University while he was talking with Leo Slizard and Robert Oppenhiemer. 
Slizard and Oppenhiemer threw themselves in front of Einstein and were
killed, Einstein was only wounded.  Both assassins were killed by Secret
Service agents assigned to protect Einstein.

Einstein did not provide much practical help to the American
Manhattan Project, but the loss of Leo Slizard was strongly felt. Finding a
replacement with his organizational skills delayed the project by several
months.

I strongly agree here as well.  The "fly into orbit" track almost made it
in OUR timeline, and with the boost RDR is giving things I think they would
have made it before the missile crowd was able to, politically, squeeze
them out.

How about Edwards as the first American in space?  Then he dies when his
Bell X-16\'s right skid fails on landing..so they can still name Edwards
Airforce Base after him...only now it\'s called Edwards SpaceForce Base. 
<G> Yeager is the second American in space, and the first to orbit.

The rocketplane program is considered "boy\'s and their toys", by the
artillery officers that run the main missile program, because the the
little planes can\'t get any kind of payload into orbit.  The Russians
basically agree and continue pursuing their artillery rocket program.

I wonder about that...the Navy might have gone for sea-based launch, and
that would have had to be missile, I\'d think.

This would give us in the early 50\'s groups pursuing:

Missile based systems

    USSR    - in the lead with first satellite in orbit
    
    US Army - concentrating on artillery applications
    
    US Navy - working on sea-launch/landing applications

    France  - behind everybody, but doggedly chugging along

Rocketplane based systems

    USAF - the X-plane program is putting single pilots into orbit, and
           beginning to move into the Dynasoar program.

    RAF - pursuing a piggy-backed rocketplane approach, and hard
          at work on hypersonic materials and engine research
          leading eventually to duel-mode engine HOTOL systems.

Cmdr.  Heinlein, given the rest of RDR\'s timeline, *should* be posted to
Area 51 as Naval Liaison Officer, and later as the coordinator for Project
Green (let\'s let RDR decide just *what* Project Green is <G>).  Einstein is
also there trying to make sense of the principals behind the wreak\'s
partially reconstructed main drive, he\'s being assisted by a brilliant
young Feyemann (who gives up smoking and doesn\'t die young of cancer).

And one more thing...let\'s get HOWARD HUGHES involved!  ;-> Maybe HH went
the "high and fast" route rather than the "big and slow" Spruce Goose
route.  Sure he *eventually* nutted out, but in the late 40\'s early 50\'s he
still could have been an innovative force.  Maybe leading a private
industry effort to produce anti-podal delivery systems for cargo and
passengers.

Seems like even a little "Tolerance" skill, or even just exposure to human
society, could lead Aslan to shrug their shoulders disapprovingly and
dismissively when it comes to human sexual relations.  What they\'d perceive
as \'dishonorable\' practices would be totally rampant and random.  Consider
a human married couple, a man and a woman -- one a ship\'s gunner, say, and
the other a military officer in a command position.  What!  Flagrant male
homosexuality!  And they think it\'s *normal*!  They even call it a *legal
marriage*!  Etc.

Interesting!  Perhaps there\'s a disproportionately large number of human
ihatei roaming around the fringes of Aslan territory, then.  Also, if the
human clans adopted polygyny as well, there could be a real shortage of
marriage partners even for first-born sons.

Kinda far out here, but:  maybe these biologically human Aslan drew on
their Solomani ancestors\' genetic engineering expertise to skew their own
birth pattern to a 3:1 F:M ratio?  Not sure how it could be done, though --
any of the biologist-types on the list care to comment?

Wow.  Never thought of this one.

Once, years ago, I GMed a Traveller game that included a vaguely homophobic
and generally sheltered, naive player, who really wanted his character to
be a dewclaw-popping Aslan warrior-stud.  I convinced him to play a
biologically human Aslan warrior-stud instead; he came up with a really
good ihatei "assassin" warrior.  The game started in Aslan space, and the
guy played his character *wonderfully* -- totally in character; a great
interpretation of Aslan psychology, and not the Klingonesque crap that
seems to be the standard.  So when the party moved into Imperial territory
and the wretched barbarians insisted on calling this character "she," the
player was only upset for a half hour or so after catching on to what the
deal was <G>.  It was a situation I could personally relate to, too...  by
the end of the adventure, he was a little *too* into it, if anything.  If
the player hadn\'t been quite so naive, I would have expected certain
mis-use of his strap-on (dewclaw!) to occur ;)

This is a really great comparison, I think -- and the anti-psionic
sentiment in the Imperium is, from what little I\'ve seen and read of
Traveller campaigns, woefully watered-down.  Traveller seems to me to
attract a lot of "munchkins" rather than "serious role-players," and the
former need to have their psi powers, and flex them...  GMs need to oppress
the hell out of their players, damn it!

This raises the question of where the members of the command structure are
drawn from, and where/how they acquire their own policy or attitude towards
these issues.  Seems to me that the upper tier of Imperial society has got
to share some commonly core of socio-cultural ethics, which is generally
"liberal" as we understand it now -- equal treatment of different species
for example -- but excluding some things (psionics, obviously, and also
homosexual marriage, probably.)

If the higher-ups lacked a *pro-actively* tolerant or inclusive approach,
the services might well only recruit those individuals who (regardless of
their own cultural background) were at least \'liberal\' enough to function
smoothly with other random citizens of the Imperium that they might be
thrown together with in a unit.  So in a sense, the Imperial military
services *do* have acting as an assimilating/homogenizing force as one of
their goals.  At the very least, they need to produce senior officers who
are able to work with diverse, perhaps segregated, units under their
command.

An extinct CT campaign I was once in featured a gang -- er, platoon -- of

I\'ve always agreed with Leonard Erickson\'s (?) earlier proposition, that
the positional uncertainty has to do with the temporal uncertainty only so
far as the planets move around while you\'re stuck in jump.  Presumably you
"aim" so that, if your jump takes the median time, you\'ll be in just the
right spot.  If you\'re "early," you either have to wait for your
destination world to "catch up" in its orbit ot take the time getting
there yourself.  If you\'re "late," you have to go chasing after your
destination.

Note that this solution encourages trade depots and such in the outer
system (as discussed extensively in the THUDDD merchant thread), because
their orbital velocities, and hence positional "uncertainties" relative to
incoming jump craft, will be lower.

"Herbig-Haro" in the Oct. 1984 Analog -- this is the one with the scout

The index for 1985 (you can always find a year\'s index in the January

lists Iverson, Eric G., with the notation "see Harry Turtledove," so I

"Bluff," Feb 1985 -- NOT one of the FTL -> low-tech stories, but an old
favorite of mine nonetheless, about the influence a simple poker game has
on the entire culture and mental life of a Sumerian-level people.

"The R Strain," Jun 1985 -- also not immediately relevant, but yet another
old favorite (I\'d forgotten how _good_ Turtledove\'s short stories were!).

"Vilest Beast," Sep 1985 -- yeesh, am I straying from the topic?  This is
the first of "Iverson"/Turtledove\'s tales of European conquest and discovery

"The Road Not Taken," Nov. 1985.  And here\'s the story of the initial

I\'d best stop now, before I further delay this letter by reading even more
(ah, the virtues of interruptible email....).  Suffice to say, before went
whole-sale into his (excellent) alternate-history route, Turtledove also
wrote excellent "conventional" science-fiction, splendidly adaptable for

It turned out that the (linked) secrets of gravitic propulsion and FTL

Agreed. And in messing with their expectations of a "feudal" Imperium. I
plan on introducing a democratic space alliance as an adversary to the
Imperium in my campaign. Most players have been so indoctrinated by
politics and Star Wars into believing democracies must be good and space
empires evil that they will probably side with the alliance even after it
holds a referendum and democratically decides that foreigners are inferior
and must be exterminated.

Starship combat hasn\'t played a big role in my campaigns. In my high school

One of my players likes Brilliant Lances, though he complains it is "too
simplistic"! He wants 3D vector movement.

In my current campaign I use the Role Playing Space Combat System by Joe
Walsh et al. For me, it is ideal because it emphasizes the actions of
characters and has decent sensor rules. The one thing I dislike about it is
that it uses a hex map. I have abandoned using hex maps for combat because
they make the game slow and wargamer-ish. Also, you cannot realistically
simulate space combat on a 2D map, it leads to absurd concepts like a
"battle line" in space.

The space combat system in T4 is too abstract and the sensor rules are
pitiful. It doesn\'t use a hex map though, which is good in my opinion.

I had always assumed the exact opposite; that a fleet that jumps at the
same time arrives separately at the destination spread out over several
hours.

This effect infuenced space combat significantly in my old campaign. Large
ships and battle riders were far more effective in fleet operations since
your firepower would all arrive together. Attacking fleets would arrive at
a "rally point", usually a gas giant, instead of the final target. The
attackers would wait for enough of their fleet to arrive before moving to
the target under maneuver drive.

This effect also had dramatic story potential. Sensor buoys or scout ships
were often stationed in deep space to watch for enemy ships and alert their
base. These ships had high thrust, so they could escape if the first
arriving ship couldn\'t immediately take them out. Attackers were often left
with the dilemma of whether to attack early with a reduced force or wait
for the entire fleet and risk the defenders discovering them.

We can have it both ways by declaring that the preparation time/destination
coordination effect was not invented until late in the Third Imperium. This
means that in Milieu 0 large battle riders were dominant, while in later
eras smaller battleships were useful.

This brings up one complaint I have with Milieu 0; it is too similar to
Milieu 1100. Surely something should change in a society over 1000 years,
yet the social, political, economic, and even technological infrastructure
is identical over the entire Third Imperium\'s lifespan.

I think IG is missing the boat on this issue; homogenizing all the milieus
is going to stereotype Traveller as the "Third Imperium game" and make the
various milieus compete with each other for players. Already several TML
posters have described Milieu 0 as watered down and said milieu 1100 is the
only interesting one. They will be correct if the only difference between
milieus is the Imperium\'s average tech level.

I think the Third Imperium is big enough to have completely different game
environments over its long history. If all the milieus were substantially
different, each could be oriented toward a particular style of play or
science fiction theme and would be interesting and playable even after
later milieus came out. One milieu could be an age of heavy iron and fusion
beams, another could have nanotech and intelligent computers. Psionic
talents could be used everyday in one era, and be harshly outlawed in
another. Huge battleships could have the military edge in one era, while
small fighters rule in another.

All this could be done simply by limiting the range of technologies
available in each milieu. For example, if thruster plates were TL 14 or so,
they would not be available in the early stage of the Third Imperium, and
Milieu 0 would be a significantly different environment than Milieu 1100.
Once starships are able to synchronize their jump arrival time, large
fleets of smaller ships become feasible. If some weapon able to destroy a
ship regardless of its size is invented, small fighters would become rulers
of the spaceways. Instead of referees trying to bend the rules to suit the
style of game they want to play, they could just choose a milieu that most
matches their style.

Exactly so we can store this information on lots of planets.

You may not need to know planet positions for all systems on _your_ ship
but some people will need to know this information. Military or
government jump couriers should have the data on every planet because
they don\'t know where they will be ordered to go.

I played in a campaign where we travelled from Capitol/Core to
Regina/Spinward Marches the hard way going directly across the Great
Rift using a J6 + J3 patrol cuiser variant designed (under TNE & MT) to
be capable of making a jump 6 & then a Jump 3 using fuel from the
collapsable fuel tank.  This ship would sometimes jump to deep space,
pump fuel into the main tank & jump again.  This ship was following a
predetermined route set at Capitol & could have just been using
planetary data acquired there but what if they had misjumped.  It seems
to me that this ship needed to know the positions of every planet (not
just mainworlds because it used wilderness gas giant refueling once or
twice). 

I think that every Imperial ship has the ability to store planetary
orbital data for every other Imperial planet in Milleau 1100.

This data would probably be taken from Second Survey data and would
probably say something like this orbit has a diameter of 150 million km,
an inclination to the ecliptic of 1 degree, an eccentricity of 0.1 %,
list semi minor & semi major axis data, give planetary mass & length of
its year.  It would also include a fixed position for the planet at a
given time (say 001 of whatever year the survey ended) and you could use
this data to calculate the position of the planet at the time you were
hoping  to come out of jump.  It would also include the data on the
relative motion of the system as a whole (relative to the galaxy) so you
could include this in.

If each planets data could be cut down to 200 bits or so & each system
has less than 50 objects, each system would take less than 10k of space.
If the Imperial data base included data on 15,000 worlds or so (every
member and most non member worlds within a sector of its borders) the
total database would only take up 150 megs of data storage space, which
is nothing to the Imperium.  Whenever you accessed this navigational
data the ships transponder would record what you were looking at.

This information could also be printed on paper, using microprint, as a
set of 2 2000 page books, each page containing data on 4 star systems in
about 2 point type, (total weight 10 kg in a box w/ a magnifying glass)
very similar to the compact edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.

If the Imperium provides this information for all its systems except the
red zones they could discourage your going to red zones.  You would have
to survey the system ahead of time, steal the data, jump in to a semi
random location (leaving the Interdiction fleet more time to track you
down & vaporize/ arrest you), or be in a Scout or military vessel which
would have the restricted Red Zone data on its computer (This idea would
open up a lot of cool adventures for Scout ships - the smugglers hire
you to go to the Red Zone because their merchant ships do not have the
chart data needed to make it easy to get there.)  The data access system
would be secretly hooked up to the ships transponder.  That way when you
went in for annual maintenance your own transponder would rat you out to
the Imperium & they could arrest you fro going to the Red Zone (if they
were smart they would wait a bit so you could not figure out how you had
been discovered).

Naturally a black market in the military versions of the paper verrsion
of the data would develop, leading to more interesting adventure
ideas...

Imperium ... art, novelties and Imperial pensions.

Art is obvious ... if a world gets a reputation for producing stuff liked by rich 
markets, you are going to get a veritable industry spring up - people making, buying and 
selling fakes, forgeries, schlock and the occasional piece that a collector is going to 
pay tens of millions for ... the locals know this, and will probably be able to demand 
large amounts of hard currency in exchange for their priceless cultural heritage.

As a source of plot hooks, the art trade is great for all those Scout/Couriers ... you 
can put a lot of paintings or statutary in a 4t cargo hold, and it could be a good idea 
to find an art expert to verify you are buying the real thing ... or to buy the buyer\'s 
expert so they are convinced they are buying the real stuff heh heh heh.

Novelties are a bit different, but the fact that useless everyday stuff on a lo-tech 
world could be considered a chic objet d\'art on a rich world ... for example, TL2 swords 
sell for about $300 here in Australia to collectors and medievalists. Ummm, D Starport, 
TL8, thats, what ICr100 ? Source world will have them for about umm ICr2. They weigh 
about 4 kilos each ... call it 200 per ton. One TL2 speculative cargo with a proven 
market, cost call it ICr1000 per ton, selling at a TL8 world for ICr10 000 per ton after 
bulk discounts (and believe me, you show to Pennsic with *good* US$100 swords, you will 
be able to sell them by the ton). Handmade persian rugs are another good example of a 
TL2-3 industrial product selling well to a TL8 market. Food products as well ... I am 
sure there is a market for home-made bread, and if you like "geniune hand-made 
peasant rye bread with extra grit, made by genuine peasants" and are prepared to pay Cr6 
for a 1 kilo loaf, that will pay for shipping it 3 parsecs and a mindblowing tenth of a 
credit for the peasant making it (it\'s double-baked rye bread ... it will keep for 3 
weeks). Heck, decorative bricks for herb gardens ... the possibilities are endless.

Finally, Imperial pensions. Lo-tech poor worlds are going to export a lot of people to 
the Imperial Navy and Marines. Many of them are going to enlist for the long term, 
beause Imperial Pensions are paid in Imperial credits, and Imperial Credits are worth a 
lot on a low-tech world. Thus the lo-tech world gets a source of hard currency to buy 
imported goods, creating a market for imports.

OK ... enough on Imperial Economics ... unless people say they are interested enough to 
hear my views on quantifying Imperial trade :)

	In general, this is true. But there\'s absolutely no need for a military
ship operating in the Spinward Marches to have detailed ephemerides for
Core Sector. First of all, they\'re probably likely to be out of date, and
hence worth no more than a 6-element ephemeride, by the time you get there.
And there\'ll be plenty of places to stop on the way to get updated
information.

	I\'d assume even the "summary" ephemerides contain all the major bodies in
a system. But like I said, ephemerides are time-sensitive. The older they
get, the less accurate they are. The question is, how accurate do they need
to be? A simple 6-element orbit doesn\'t account for the myriad of
perturbation effects in a real system; it\'s based on the two-body
approximation. And even more accurate methods can\'t model ALL the
perturbations in a system.

	Besides, most people, even military ships, don\'t NEED detailed (but
quickly stale) information on every single system in the Imperium. Jump
couriers probably work on a fixed route, and a military deployment across
the Imperium would be such a major event that you\'d either get updates
along the way, or assuming a full-scale war, you\'d use scouts anyway.

	Most ships need at the MOST detailed information on every system within 36
parsecs of their intended destinations (in case of misjump).

Hmmm.  I respect the power of this weapon, but I just figured it might
take a bit more to utterly sever a limb.  I guess it depends on the
musculature of the target as well.

I add my background to this;

I have a BS in History, minor in Computer Science (wonder how that
combination could get rolled in the character gen process); spent the last
22 years in Data Processing (pays better than history), mostly with IBM
based systems, micro, mini & mainframe. Currently Senior Systems Programmer
on a VSE/ESA system for a marketing research firm. With the last few
iterations of IBM\'s mainframe operating systems adding multiple Virtual,
Data and Hiper (yes, that is the correct spelling) spaces; I feel right at
home with Traveller\'s jump space.

The interest in history that initially selected by first college major is
still with me, Ancient & Medieval mostly, which explains my fascination with
C & S as will as A D & D. I also enjoy Asimov, Heilein & Clarke, the 30s,
40s and 50s type of SF, which explains my inclination to Traveller.

Who\'s next?

Already working on it!  I might have missed one or two submitted

plan on compiling them into a single list and reposting it.  This will
then give people a chance to restructure their submitted info, while

I only speculated that they *could* drop by.  How much they have to
offer for export would determine *why* someone might drop by.

TL1 systems can still be highly productive agricultural producers.
They might also possess vast reservoirs of timber, minerals,
Lanthanum, etc.  TL1 worlds can be classified as "rich" under the
right circumstances.

If you are saying that the rural areas of Mexico are TL1 or TL0
because they cannot *produce* technology above this, the same can be
said for many areas of most other countries (see Craig\'s post
regarding the TL of Beverly Hills).

If you are saying so based on the fact that few pieces of high tech
exist in these areas, this is more a basis of whether or not the
citizens can *afford* such technology.

Based on my original posting, I figured Mexico\'s overall TL to be
around 5 or 6.  Now, after reading Craig and Volker\'s posts, I feel
comfortable raising it to TL7.  Just because a country (or world)
doesn\'t produce high-tech fighter planes, doesn\'t mean that it
*can\'t*.

	Brilliant!  Of course!  And let\'s not forget those funky backpack

Leonard: Noted your points re: Einstein.  FIY, Adams and Mueller are old
PC\'s from my group, doing the odd cameo in the timeline (as were Zhukov,
Dunhill, White, Carlton, and Frost).  Believe me, kidnapping scientists for
the Nazis is exactly the sort of mischief they would have gotten up to had
they met as per the timeline... it was more of an in-group joke than
anything else.

One of the things I am thinking of is that the Imperial Navy would like such colonies to 
exist (apart from anything else, uninhabited systems are havens for pirates et al), but 
is unable to officially do anything to assist. On the other hand, INI slush funds exist, 
and if they have a planetary navy (the fact that it is one lightly armed Far Trader need 
not be mentioned in the official reports), then the IN could institute an officer 
training exchange program ... like maybe we lend them a chap with Instructuion-3, Vacc 
Suit-2 and Pilot-2.

A related but important issue is the cost of constructing a starport ... anybody got any 
rules of thumb on the cost of building class E, D and C starports (I dont wanna think 
about the cost of class B and A starports).

Also, as far as trade goes, the cost of fuel is ridiculous ... given fuel refining units 
are cheap, and hydrogen is free and available in most systems, fuel should cost about 
Cr200 per ton, tops. And why the hell do staterooms cost Cr2000 a fortnight for 
maintainence when you pay a gunner Cr1000 a month? OK, the maintainence cost of 0.1% of 
ship cost is ridiculous as well (IMO should be 1% per year, going up by 1% per ten years 
of age of the ship).  Has anyone burned down the costs half of the economics system and 
re-designed it so it works ?

Typical. Realistic combat usually means far too deadly. Combat is not as dangerous as 
some games would make it out to be. Face it, if combat was as deadly as the "realistic" 
systems portrayed it, then casualty rates in war would be in the area of 75%, rather than 
the 5% it is now

As a long-time lurker, all I can say is that pretty much _anything_ that might be encountered in a Traveller campaign is of potential interest.
 
(This is a roundabout way of saying that if you don\'t find something of interest, then DON\'T READ IT).
 
That having been said, some general conclusions:
 
*  If you have a world with as many societies and cultures as Earth, then the multiplicy of worlds in the Imperium are likely to be even more diverse than just Terra.  Even given the "diaspora" character of cheap FTL, etc.
 
*  The "what is the Imperial stance on homosexuality?" is a meaningless noise.  Frankly, given the range of societies, and the fact that _communication_ goes only as fast as travel, the "Imperial culture" is likely to be similar to that of the old British Empire, doubled and redoubled...what goes on in the colonies is different than back in England, and what people think in the Midlands is different than what they think in the East End, or in the City.
 
*  From a purely _economic_ perspective, worrying about the behavior of one group of consenting adults on a moral basis is sand in the gears of the economy.  The question really ought to be, "How can I still make a profit?"
 
*  Lastly, what humans do with each other is likely to be considered FAR less interesting/worth worrying about after we encounter aliens.  As one friend of mine put it, "Hey, I can easily see the relationship between science fiction and alternate sexuality.  Once you imagine having sex with an alien, having sex with someone of your own gender seems pretty normal and tame, in comparison!"
 
Just another subsector heard from....

when I uncovered the problems with the T4 task system.  I sent out a 
call for help, and people responded.

New members to this list wouldn\'t believe what occurred.  We worked 
together with one common goal:  fix the task system.  People were 
posting probability tables.  Game mechanics and ideas were bandied 
about.  Joe Walsh dubbed me task system coordinator.  And the result 
was KBv1.1, Glenn Grant\'s D66 system, Eris Reddoch\'s aptitude 
system, and a few others.

We all worked together, and it was nothing like the recent KBv2.0 vs 
T4v2 debate.  It was a time that many of us think fondly of.  We did 
something that actually improved the game, and we made our point 
clear enough that Marc Miller agreed and changed the existing T4 task 
system for the revised edition of Traveller.

Well, it\'s time to band together again.  TMLers, take heed!  Respond 
to your call to duty!



The subject this time is the BSCS--the Basic Ship Combat System that 
starts on page 117 of Book 1.  The goal this time is not to fix it, 
but to diagnose it.

I\'ve been shopping for a ship combat system for my game, and, always 
wanting to look at the official rules first, I started with the BSCS. 
 
Many have said that it is broken, but few have said why.  Although 
I\'ve played Traveller for over a decade, I haven\'t played starship 
combat in depth.  To my "almost virgin" eyes, this thing was hard to 
read and follow.

With the upcoming release of T4-revised pending, I worry that the 
BSCS will go unchanged.  It needs to be fixed.  If I\'m having trouble 
following it, then I can only imagine what a new Traveller player 
will think.

This brings me to the goal of this exercise:

                  Diagnose the BSCS



Let\'s tell IG what is wrong with BSCS and let them know what we would 
like to see in its place.  I\'m not talking about coming up with our 
own system, and I\'m not talking about misdirected negativity.

What I am talking about is constructive criticism of the BSCS.  That 
means, we state what is wrong with it AND we state what it would take 
to make us happy.

So, as a TML member, what would you like to see as the BSCS?

I\'m sending this post to Marc Miller and Imperium Games.  You may 
want to send your thoughts there as well.

Let\'s make this revised edition perfect.

Long Live Traveller!

state that IG should consider basing BSCS on another game system.



First Thoughts:

It\'s no secret that the BSCS is a reguritation of High Guard revised 
for T4.  HG is more attuned to large fleet actions and capitol ships. 
 I think the BSCS should focus on player ships.  Since most player 
ships are small, 200-400 ton merchant vessels, I think that the T4 
basic system should be based on the original starship combat system 
(from Little Black Book-2, Starter Traveller, and the Traveller Book) 
or Mayday.

Actually, both of these systems are pretty close, except that 
the LLB-2 and TB systems used unweildy distance measuring 
rules--a mm on the game board represents 100 km, and vector changes 
required protractors to figure the degree of the turn.

GDW got it right when they used the same system in Starter Traveller 
sans the awkward measurment rules.  All of a sudden, a hex (or a 
range band, as it was called in the rules) was equal to 10,000 km.  
Although the scale was somewhat different, GDW incorporated the 
game-friendly movement rules from Mayday with the starship combat 
rules from LLB-2 and TB.

It was a good combination, and this is the type of system I\'d like to 
see in the T4-revised book.



Diagnosing the Current BSCS:

If the decision is made to stay with the current combat system in T4, 
there are still some changes I\'d like to see.  I\'ll take these 
systematically in the order they appear in the book.



Page 105:  Software.
I\'ve got to admit, I was ecstatic to see the inclusion of the old 
computer rules from LLB-2, ST, and TB in T4.  I really like the 
tactical and strategic decisions that a player has to make with 
regard to his software.  Which programs is he going to need in future 
turns?  How will his decisions now help or hinder him in his next 
moves?  Should he use Evade, Predict, or Gunner?

The problem with the computer rules in the existing T4 rule book is 
that it is unclear how they are used.  There is no mention of them in 
the BSCS chapter, but, rather, you see a table in the Spacecraft 
chapter.

We don\'t know how they are used in combat (especially since this 
rule was taken from the LLB-2, ST, and TB combat systems while the 
BSCS is based on HG--a system which does not use this type of 
computer rules).  There is no description in the text describing what 
each program does, and they have deleted some of the programs that 
used to be available in LLB-2 et. al.

Further, there is no mention of how many programs can be included in 
a ship\'s computer (this used to be called space) nor is their mention 
of how many of these programs can be used at one time--based on the 
ship\'s computer (this used to be called capacity).

Given the current presentation of these rules in Book 1, it is easy 
for a player to assume that he can have as many of these programs 
running at one time as he wishes, and that doesn\'t seem right to 
me.

On page 90, it states that computer models purchases include a basic 
software package of commonly used programs, but no where in the text 
does it describe what these common programs are.  I think that a list 
should be included stateing what programs are common for different 
types of ships, or this should ge included in the description part of 
the various ship examples given in Book 1 (starting on page 100).

I\'d like to see the computer rules revised (and maybe updated for the 
90\'s) for T4.  I really like the fact that they are included, but, as 
is, they are close to unusable.



Page 117:  BSCS Introduction section.
It states in the introduction that a map is required using range 
bands, squares, or hexes, but then later in the section, it states 
that the ranges used in starship combat do not measure actual 
distances.  

I understand this from HG, but that part about squares and hexes 
throws me off.  I can see using a range band chart to keep track of 
what arbitrary ranges the different space craft involved in the fight 
are at, but I can\'t see how a hex grid could be used for this.  Hex 
maps are used to plot representative distances--not the arbitrary 
distances used in BSCS.

For clarity, I suggest removing the reference to squares and hexs, 
and just leave in the range band part.

A paragraph should be added explaining this "conceptual" distance 
system.  Most game players expect to see a hex map and 
counters--where the hexes correspond to actual distances--when they 
play a space combat game.  This conceptual range system helps put the 
focus on role playing, but it is hard for players to comprehend at 
first.  

I suggest an example of play included in the BSCS chapter where it is 
noted that the GM will keep track of ranges using a range band chart, 
but there is no actual need for the players to actually view this.  
They focus on what\'s going on with their ship and can ask questions 
like, "Where\'s that Vargr corsair now?", and the GM can respond 
(looking at his range band chart), "It just moved into close range, 
and it\'s firing!"

There\'s another thing I\'d like to see changed with the BSCS.  The 
conceptual ranges used are nice, but they should be included as an 
optional rule.  I\'d also like to see a range system used that uses 
exact ranges.  This way, players can plot out movement on a hex board 
with couters in the traditional manner.  This is the way I like to 
play starship fights, and I\'m sure that many others feel that way 
too.

It shouldn\'t be too hard to included both types of systems in BSCS.  
Leave in the conceptual system for those who like it, but also add 
exact ranges for the others.  I\'d base BSCS combat on the exact range 
system, but throw in the conceptual range system as an alternative 
way to play.

One last note on ranges.  If it is decided that an exact range system 
be used, some thought should be given to the Master Range table 
included on the T4 GM Screen.  It seems that most recent Traveller 
space combat systems are based on hexes representing distance of 
30,000 km (and that\'s completely fine with me--I can see the logic in 
basing the distance of a hex on a portion of the distance of a light 
second), but maybe the ranges used on the Master Range table should 
be considered for consistency (actually, I guess the 30,000 km 
starship ranges should be added to the Master Range table).



Page 117:  General Notes on BSCS.
One thing that I\'d like to see is more character involvement in the 
combat system.  As in Brilliant Lances, I like the task throws based 
on a character\'s skills.  Take the sensor task throws for example.  
It would be nice if a character\'s sensor skill impacted the outcome 
of this task.



Page 117:  Step 2:  Initiative.
I like a certain randomness in initiative throws.  It would be nice 
to see a 1 D6 throw as part of determinig initiaive.

Also, I don\'t think that Leadership is a good skill pick to modify 
initiative.  Ship\'s Tactics should be added to the skill list, and if 
not, regular Tactics skill should be used instead of Leadership.



Page 117:  Step 4:  Break Off.
There\'s some energy point information left over from HG.  The 
reference to energy points should either be taken out or explained 
somewhere in the chapter.



Page 117:  Step 5:  Sensor Action.
This paragraph is confusing and should be written more clearly.  I do 
like the inclusion of sensors in the BSCS, and I like the easy to 
follow to understand rules for sensor scans and locks.

There should be some explanation about passive scans and active 
scans, and questions like "Are the passive scanners considered to be 
running all the time?" should be answered.  When the players are 
trotting along in space and an enemy ship approaches at extreme 
range, are the players automatically notified by a passive scan?  Do 
they have to make a skill roll?  How is a GM supposed to handle this 
if there is a chance that the character\'s aren\'t aware of the 
threatening ship?



Page 117:  Additional Thoughts.
Finally, there are other issues that I\'d like to see addressed in the 
BSCS.  For instance, how does gravity effect movement (I know that 
this is really not an issue with the conceptual range system)?

Additionally, there should be a section in the BSCS chapter that 
discusses decompression, atmospheric braking, abandoning ship, damage 
control, and repair parts.

If the present system is used, some large starships should be 
included in the example spacecraft section starting on page 100 to 
let players see some capital ship designs that use meson guns, 
meson screens, and black globes.  The BSCS 
rules cover these, but there are no ready made ships to use in 
combat.

How about boarding actions?  There should be a paragraph or two that 
discusses how a ship can be boarded and what an attacking ships needs 
to do to set troops off on another.

If the BSCS is to cover large fights between capitol ships, then 
Fleet tactics should be added to the skill list and included in the 
rules.

What about surprise?  Isn\'t it possible to surprise another ship?  
This should be discussed.  Likewise, there should be some discussion 
about where a ship can hide in space--behind a planet, in the EM 
poles, and other areas that can make  a ship blind to sensors.

If the computer rules are to be used (as I discussed above), then a 
computer reprogramming phase should be included in the combat steps.  
How much time does it take to load one of those things anyway?

Crew casualties--there should be some notes on this when a specific 
area of the ship containing crew members is hit.

Finally, as with all of the systems in T4, an eye towards keeping the 
BSCS compatible with any larger, more detailed rules system should be 
considered.  When a complete, detailed T4 starship combat system 
comes out (and, I can\'t wait for this), the ships used in BSCS should 
be compatible with the more detailed system.

Long Live Traveller!

Kenneth.

Well, okay. Not that I have any _technical_ skills applicable to Traveller...

I\'ve got a BA in Creative Writing from Concordia University, here in
Montreal. I\'m a science fiction writer, editor, reviewer and illustrator.
My first and only academic publication credit is "Transcendence Through
Detournement in William Gibson\'s Neuromancer", Science Fiction Studies #50
(March 1990).

Some of my short fiction: "Memetic Drift", Interzone magazine #34,March
1990 - North American reprint in _Northern Stars_ (Tor 1995); "Suburban
Industrial", Interzone magazine #41, Nov. 1990; and "Storm Surge",
Interzone magazine #46, April 1991. (A few years ago I sold the German
translation rights to "Storm Surge" to Heine Verlag, for an anthology of
world sf edited by Wolfgang Jeschke, but I have yet to hear if it was
published. I don\'t suppose any of our list members in Germany would have
seen it over there?)

I used to co-edit and contribute to a small-press comics \'zine called _Mind
Theatre_, and I published three issues of _Edge Detector_, a speculative
fiction magazine (featuring work by Paul DiFilippo, Rudy Rucker, Peter
Lamborn Wilson, Hakim Bey and Charles Platt).

David Hartwell and I co-edited _Northern Stars: The Anthology of Canadian
Science Fiction_ (Tor hardcover, 1995), which included work by William
Gibson, Charles de Lint, Spider Robinson, Robert J. Sawyer, Donald
Kingsbury, Judith Merril, Robert Charles Wilson, and many others. (American
TMLers are encouraged to look for it in their local remainder shops
[belated plug]) We are currently at work on a new volume of Canadian SF and
Fantasy, tentatively titled _Northern Suns_.

I\'ve reviewed sf books for the Montreal Gazette, SF Eye, The New York
Review of Science Fiction, and other periodicals. My infamous "Memetic
Lexicon" article on memes and memetic concepts can be found on the "Church
of Virus" Website:
<http://maxwell.lucifer.com/virus/hb_index.html>. It originally appeared in
bOING bOING and VIRUS 23 magazines.

My interests include futurology, drawing, digital graphic design, Memetics,
alternative comics, alternative music, and Traveller. Most recently I\'ve
begun to turn my hand to Web page design; check out my (unspectacular but
useful) site for Nebula Books, a great place to look for (and mail-order)
sf, fantasy, mystery, film books, comic collections and other cool stuff,
at:
<http://www.cam.org/~nebula>. We\'re currently working on turning this site
into a searchable CGI database of recent books.

Jeez, I think that\'s enough plugs for one post, don\'t you?

Substance abuse, attitudes concerning it, and consequences of it are all
*highly* intriguing topics in investigating any society; they often
provide a window into larger questions of personal responsibility,
standards of conduct, and views on moral and ethical issues.  For example,
one of the most interesting aspects of Aztec society is how they
structured and regulated consumption of pulque, their prefered alcoholic
beverage.  You can figure out a *lot* about the society just from these
rules and customs. 

Similarly, teen pregnancy is only a problem in our society because it
tends to produce babies who don\'t have adequate emotional or financial
support; there are all kinds of "moral" arguments made about this, but
that\'s the root reason that early/extramarital sex are so discouraged in
our society.  In a highly clan-oriented society, teen pregnancy might well
be highly prized; the baby will be *everyone*\'s child, so support issues
don\'t come up, and young mothers tend to have healthier kids.  So again,
attitudes on teen pregnancy are a window into the larger nature of
society.

> one, or how about Political Correct behavior in the Imperium, I bet

What society does with the aged and infirm is yet another indicator of
what the society is like as a whole.  Put them in rest homes, or strand
them on ice floes?  Treat them as revered elders supported by an extended
family, village, or tribe, or confine them as embarrassing, irrelevant old
fogies?  Any of these speaks volumes about how the society works.

PC behavior is a goldmine of information!  What *can\'t* one say in polite
society in the Imperium?  What is taboo?  What will gain you a reputation
as a daring rake, and what slight change from that will flip you into
utter ostracism?  I can\'t imagine a better way to see what matters to a
society, and what it\'s neurotic about.  Consider that fucking, eating, and
shitting are all normal, natural, universal human activities, but only one
of these is considered a fit cocktail-party topic.  Imagine a society
where you could cheerfully announce "I had the *best* sex this afternoon!"
at a high-society party, and be met with smiles...but saying "I had a
*great* sandwich for lunch today!" would earn you frosty, uncomfortable
glares, and actually *eating* that sandwich in public could get you
arrested.

Sturm, I think you were trying to be sarcastic, but you ended up
emphasizing the point we\'re trying to make -- that gender/sex roles, and
attitudes on them, are just as important to the Traveller universe as
battledress point-defense options.

I believe sturm may be being a bit sarcastic here but I am not.  I do
not wish to offend you sturm.  Sturm if you do not like the post, just
skip it.  I get the list in digest form.  When I see a post I do not
want to read (and there are not very many of these) I simply hit the
Page Down button on a my computer 2 or 3 times (total elapsed time about
0.5 second).

Yes it would be appropriate but unless it was part of a longer post
about population demographics and such would not get much response.

Yes this would be a _great_ topic for a thread.  When you consider the
number of Traveller encounters, adventures, fights, and such you really
need to wonder just how high the alchoholism rate among PC\'s is.  I have
seen about 10 very heavy drinking charecters, 20 or 30 more who seem to
go to bars a lot, 20 or 30 more who only go to bars with their
shipmates, only 2 or 3 that do not drink, and only _1_ actual
alchoholic.

Of course if I got into half of what the average party of PC\'s does I\'d
probably be tempted to drink heavily myself...

I would like to see more encounters that start something like

You are all in a bookstore
You are all in a laundrymat
You are all in a 100 person long que at customs
You are all in a resturant
You are all in a clothing store

But I\'ll probably see 10 that start "You are all in a bar"

It could be an interesting post.  Several years ago DGP did some great
articles on the care of wounds, illness, and the like but (except for
anagathics) we have really not seen much on geriatric care in the Third
Imperium.  You could even start a campaign that would require all the
PC\'s to be at least 75 years old, although you would have to change the
term limits rule.

I don\'t think the Third Imperium is politically correct but if you can
post an interesting post, please do so.

I never really have understood what this term "Politically Correct" means,
it seems to get thrown about alot nowadays, but its never defined. It strikes
me rather like the terms "Pinko and Facist" sort of an all purpose put down.

The important point here (to me at least) is that Traveller is a role playing
game; and as such just how the society I\'m roleplaying in functions, is both
facinating and vitally important. The minutae of how the society I\'m playing
in works is far more important (to me at least) than the minutae of how a fusion
gun or a jump drive works. I keep my interest in technical minutae for
wargames, for me roleplaying is exactly that, roleplaying.

Well I like the idea of having an Imperium like structure binding the
planets together. I\'ll have the nobility linked closely with the major
corporation, as will the whole Imperial power structure. I don\'t think i\'ll
be using any of the usual T4 alien races, I prefer to create my own. The
aliens that I will introduce as the game progresses are a mix and match from
SF books and films. Definately there will be Minbari, Vorlon [as background
colour], Narn from B5 series. Also I will have The Culture from the I.Banks
novels out on the fringes, who knows what Special Circumstances will think
of the Imperium. Has anyone got any ideas on rules for creating new aliens,
the section in the T4 book 1 does not go into much detail. Would racial
maximums on stats be the way to go?=20

As you can see i\'m taking elements from two different sources, and mixing
them together. The players will start off in the Imperium Core, and slowly
move out towards the Rim Worlds. I\'ll introduce the aliens slowly, maybe
allowing them as PC\'s at a future point. The Vorlon and Culture will
definately be there as background colour, no way am I letting these as PC\'s
[though a human as part of the Cultures SC branch could be fun]. It\'s not
that I don\'t like the Traveller alien races, but these others just work
better for me, and add a familiar reference for the players.

I checked my PBEM archives for it, but it\'s lost.  I\'ve cc:\'d Metlay
if he\'d care to comment on whether he still has it and it\'s release.
In my opinion it crosses the line for taste in a public forum and
I would not want it posted to the TML, but it is deep background

The main use for skill levels is as DMs for other tasks, not to reduce the
effect of your own tasks. JoAT is kind of a special case; it applies at a
reduced level to a lot of tasks instead of significantly to just one task.
Using the skill level instead of the experience (or "skill points") is just
a simple way to get that effect without having to divide attributes on the
fly, which the T4 task system required.

Think of the skill experience as the \'active\' skill; it\'s worth a lot of
points but you have to roll to see if it works or not. The skill level is
\'passive\'; it\'s fewer points but they always work. For example, in Brawling
you add your Brawling experience to your target number to hit and subtract
your opponents Brawling skill. You get more points but you have to roll to
hit. Your opponent subtracts fewer points but doesn\'t have to roll to
defend.

The example I used was Brawling, but it applies to other skills as well.
You add Recon skill level to the suprise roll, add Tactics skill levels to
the Tactics pool, add Carousing skill level to the high passengers table,
Admin to the middle passengers table, Broker skill level to the Actual
Value table, and several others. In all these cases you do not make a task
roll to see if you succeed or not, you just add the relevant skill.

I have used the same principle for other skills. For example, one time my
players were trying to hack into a computer storing some scout\'s personal
logs. The scout had password-protected the data personally so I had to take
her skill level into account. Now, the scout wasn\'t actually there to
thwart their attempt, so it wasn\'t really an opposed task, and I didn\'t
want to have to generate the character just to make a single task roll. So
I just arbitrarily decided the scout had Computer-2 and gave them a -2 DM.
Again, the skill level acts as a DM without requiring a task roll. This
applies to every skill, so you\'re just better off recording the skill level
for every skill and not coming up with special rules for which skills they
apply to.

In fact I suggest this should be a standard rule for KBv2.0. Skill
experience counts in tasks where you have to roll to find if you succeed or
not. Skill levels count in DMs where the skill always applies without a
task roll. Don\'t try to mix the two, use one or the other. For example,
don\'t require a task roll to see if a character can apply a skill DM or
not.

>ps. Ken and Richard, please consider this *good-natured* banter, not
>mean-spirited attacks!

I never considered it anything else Eris. In fact I welcome your feedback;
didn\'t Plato say "the unexamined game is not worth playing" or something?
Besides, after looking at the credits for the Role-Playing Space Combat
system, I couldn\'t have a bad opinion of you.

Just a quick note... ROF *will* affect damage when the range

The problem is that for armor piercing, this assumes that all
weapons in a battery hit exactly the same spot on the hull.  This is
the trouble with most of the simplifications used to get "fleet
level" rules, IMO.

I have this as well in my system...

Interesting, but again, this overly favors multiple small weapons
linked together.  1000 machine guns won\'t get a critical hit on the
New Jersey, for example.

	Yes.  Actually, this would be an interesting topic, albeit one
that would be difficult due to cross-cultural variation.  How would
"alien" diets, biospheres, 
and genetic engineering affect menarche?  What are Imperium-standard laws
concerning "age of consent", age appropriate to marriage, and children
born out of wedlock (or is it more of a local ethnolegal concern)?

	Good thread.  What about controlled substances?  Are there
addictive substances that the Imperium recognizes or does NOT recognize?
I once ran a scenario revolving around the smuggling of a substance (not
unlike Khat on Earth) that was recognized as a controlled substance by one
polity and not another.

	Geriatric care?  You bet.  Are there Euthanasia laws in place?
Are families expected to take care of their own elderly?  At what age are
you *considered* elderly with higher life expectancies?  What kind of
bureaucratic problems would you have when chronological age means
something entirely different from biological age.

	Politically Correct behaviour?  That may require a lot of assumed
knowledge concerning the minutiae of Imperium culture.  It would be
interesting to posit a kind of cultural backlash against
traditional/possible outdated Imperium mores and norms.

	I am *not* being sarcastic.  The topics that you suggest are
interesting, although some may involve a depth of discussion that may not
interest everybody.  The material that you raise is what separates
"mediocre" or cardboard worlds from more well-rounded science
fiction.  It is what drew a lot of us to Traveller in the first place.

	True.  Many "unacceptable" behaviours are beliefs/practices that

America.

	There are few "universal" cultural taboos, child molesting and

being universally repugnant in the future.

	The discussion of sexuality is important in understanding certain
aspects of a culture.  That\'s why anthropologists are interested in it
cross-culturally.

	If you find yourself uncomfortable with a topic, or simply
uninterested in it, then skip the thread.  Skip the sarcasm while you are

Aha -- that\'s why our original gdw-beta discussion hinged on establishing
a minimum "gravitational gradient" to allow "pushing", which later got
simplified back into the "x-many diameters" figure.  Calculate out what
the relative gravitational effects are from, say, the Sun when you\'re at
Jupiter\'s distance, and that far-trader a few space-combat hexes away.
You\'ll find a big difference.  We deliberately made one possible, the
other not -- it just isn\'t explained very well in the current text.
(I have on the back-burner a "how thruster plates work" article for my
web site.  Anyone else been working on something similar?)

Admittedly, the "gravity-well-pushing" thruster plates _do_ give a hint
of the direction repulsor technology might come from -- but isn\'t that a
good thing?

	Actually, I think you can find several groups, either today or in history, 
that have or are in favour of child molesting or incest. Take for example, 
NAMBLA (the North American Man-Boy Love Association, or some such 
noncense). And while I wouldn\'t be surprised to find modern organizations 
in favour of de-criminalizing incest, my best example is the terrible 
inbreeding in the royal houses of Europe, or in ancient Egypt.

    'body' => 'Here\'s a companion piece to my article on Jumpdrives.

The FTL application of the "Jumpdrive" grew out of research into improving
the performance of its cousin, the Indeterminate Position Field Generator,
more commonly called the "Stutterjump Drive." Today the STL Stutter Drive
and FTL Jump Drive share many components, and operate in a similar fashion.

Indeterminate Positional Field Theory / Jump Theory

An alteration the probability of vacuum fluctuations within in a region of
space makes the positional location and discrete existence of any
matter/energy within that region indeterminate and unobservable from
outside the affected field.  The collapse of the field altering the ZPF
probabilities precipitates the observation of the existence and location of
such mass/energy. 

Within such a field a directed pulse of anti-gravitons forms a wave of
increased positional probability along the pulse\'s wavefront. This
increases the probability that the indeterminate matter will coalesce along
the pulse\'s path with the highest probability at the wavefront of the
pulse.

While the matter within the field is indeterminate it can not be said to
exist in this universe.  Theoretically it may exist in some "hyperspace"
but in truth we simply don\'t know where it actually is..or if it *is* at
all.  All we can really say is that its existence and location is
undetermined.

The existence of indeterminate positional fields are theorized to exist in
nature within wormholes and near Hawking singularities. No naturally
occurring wormholes have been found, but research at  Atlantian Station
near Tau Ceta-19A7, the only black hole in known space, has tended to
confirm the existence of a permanent IP field within the Swarthchild Limit.

Artificially created IP fields can be generated with relative ease in
vacuum, but are maintainable for only about 1 millionth of a second.
Research into extending the duration of IP fields by injecting hydrogen gas
into the expanding field lead to the creation of
gravity lenses and what we believe is a small artifical wormhole. Years of
work and the unfortunate loss of many lives eventually lead to the
invention of the Jumpdrive.  Research continues in an effort to both better
understand the IP field\'s nature and to improve both Stutterjump and
Jumpdrive performance.
                                  
Stutterdrive components

    1.  Jump Field Projector Coil - Mounted on the bow of a ship, the
        coil projects a field that surrounds the ship from bow to
        stern.
            
    2.  Field Collector Ring - Mounting around the stern of a ship,
        the ring pinches closed the field projected by the bow coil.

    3.  Gravitational Pulse Generator - Mounted at the center of the
        coil, the pulse generator fires a pulse of anti-gravitons
        directly forward.  This forms a "forward probability wave"
        on which the ship will ride.
        
    4.  Lanthium Jump Grid - Embedded in the hull of the ship, the
        lanthium grid maintains a bubble of coherent space around
        and within the ship protecting it from dissipation during the
        jump period.  Because the ship will be in "jumpspace" for an
        extremely short period, the Lanthium Grid can run on low
        power.
        
Stutterdrive Process

    1.  The Lanthium grid is energized to low power.  The grid will
        remain on while the Stutterdrive is operational.  The grid
        requires approximately 5 seconds to come up to the low power
        needed for Stutterdrive operation.  At this low power, the
        characteristic glowing pattern on the surface of the hull
        armor does not appear.

    2.  Energy is fed to one of the bow coils from the main power plant
        causing an IP, or jump, field to form around the ship.  The
        field requires < 10e-12 seconds to form, and must be closed
        at the ship\'s stern by the ring collector or it will
        immediately collapse.  The field\'s duration is limited to
        less than 10e-6 seconds.  The field strength is controlled
        by the pilot determining the distance in front of the ship
        the field will extend, and hence the distance the ship will
        jump.  Depending on Tech Level and the power applied, this
        distance can reach 50 meters.
        
    3.  The ship\'s location within the field, outside the lanthium
        grid, becomes indeterminate with equal probability at all
        points, and from an outside viewer\'s perspective vanishes.
        If the grid fails the structure of the ship, it\'s components
        and crew will begin to take damage, but the short duration
        of the jump field in stutterdrive mode means that the drive
        could be used for a short period without the grid in
        operation before the damage becomes severe.
        
    4.  As the coil comes to full power, the gravitational pulse
        generator at it\'s center automatically fires directly
        forward.  This creates a "forward probability wave" within
        the jump field. 
        
    5.  The jump field collapses and the ship reappears with the tip
        of the ship\'s bow at the forward limit of the previous jump
        field.  The effect viewed using high-speed cameras is the
        ship disappears from point A and reappears at point B a few
        meters forward.
        
    6.  The coil and generator systems reset and prepare to fire.
        This cycle can be repeated up to 40,000 times per second,
        depending on the Tech Level of the system.  The most
        efficient operational mode, it has been discovered, is to
        cycle the system at close to it\'s maximum rate.  Slower
        cycles increase wear from expansion/contraction within the
        coil and reduces MTBF.
        
    7.  Ships generally mount multiple coil/generator systems on the
        ship\'s bow and fire them in series, effectively raising the
        number of "jumps" to hundreds of thousands per second.
        Decades of research and experiment have determined that the
        optimum configuration is 5 coil/generator systems located on
        the bow with one directly forward and each of the other four
        equally placed around the bow\'s circumference.  Using more
        coil/generator systems sets up interferance patterns within
        the coils that both decreases their MTBF and lowers their
        cycle rate.
            
            
Stutterdrive Limitations

  Coils may be energized creating jump fields anywhere, but there
  are a number of limitations.

    1.  Within an atmosphere a jump field will attempt to surround
        the entire volume of the atmosphere, causing it to collapse
        immediately with no effect other than the loss of the energy
        pumped into the coil as heat.  This has a decidedly bad
        effect on the jump coil.  This also means that ships need a
        different means of lifting from and landing on planets that
        have an atmosphere.
        
    2.  Jump fields may not be formed within or overlapping other
        jump fields.  Small ships and missiles may not be launched
        under stutterdrive power from inside a ship.  Ships that
        move within a few hundred meters of each other overlap
        fields and until they move apart may not form fields.
        
    3.  Because a Stutterdrive\'s pulse generator fires straight
        ahead, and this is required to avoid uncontrollable
        vibrations that will tear the ship apart, it follows it\'s
        bow in a straight line.  Changing direction requires changing
        the orientation of the bow with attitude jets, grav-control
        units or gyroscopes.
        
    4.  The shape of the IP field constrains the shape that stutter
        driven craft may take.  The field forms as an ellipsoidal
        with an extended fore and a rounded aft.  Craft become
        increasingly inefficent as their keel to beam (length to
        width) ratio falls below 5 to 1.  Below 2 to 1 the field is
        too broad and can\'t be closed by the stern ring and the
        stutter and jump drives become non-operational.  Above 12 to
        1 and the field needs to be too narrow to allow it to extend
        in front of the ship, and the stutter and jump drives again
        become non-operational.  Most ships are built with K2B
        ratios between 3 to 1 and 10 to 1.  As a general rule, short
        ratioed ships have increased turning benefits, but are
        slower, and longer ratioed ships are faster, but turn more
        slowly.
        
  The Stutterdrive primary limitation is that it does not change a
  ship\'s actual momentum or velocity.  This means a ship must also
  mount a secondary drive capable of providing deltaV changes of up
  to 100kps when engaged in inter-system travel, and 50kps for
  intra-system travel.  Grav-drives, HePlar, and Fusion drives are
  the most common choices.
  
Stutterdrive Advantages

    1.  Stutterdrives allow ships to travel at pseudo velocities of
        500kps at lower TL\'s, up to 9,000kps at extremely high TL\'s.
        
    2.  Stutterdrives cycle up to, and down from full pseudo-speed in
        under 30 seconds.
        
    3.  Stutterdrive driven ships don\'t require Inertial
        Compensation because they don\'t change the actual momentum
        of the ship.  IComp is generally still provided to offset
        turning and momentum changes from the secondary drive.
        
    4.  Stutterdrives are generally less expensive to build,
        install, and maintain than are available alternatives
        offering equivilant performance.
        
    5.  Ships with installed Stutterdrives either are, or can be
        made Jump capable very easily.  Ships that are Jump capable
        are by their nature also Stutter-capable.
        
    6.  An unexpected side-benefit of the Stutterdrive are the
        effects of the Lanthium Grid on explosive decompression.
        The Grid field creates an effect analogous to surface
        tension tending to hold the ship\'s atmosphere inside.  Holed
        ships lose their air much more slowly as it seems to leak
        away, rather than gushing out.  This fortunate benefit has
        resulted in ships running their grids at low power at all
        times, even when not maneuvering, and in the installation of
        redundantly overlapping grid units to insure continued
        coverage even when areas of the hull have been damaged or
        destroyed.
        

Double whew!  This article is even longer than the first!  Again, I know
this won\'t be to everyone\'s taste, but it is the way I\'m already handling
STL...although this is the most comprehensive explaination of this
technology I\'ve written.  If anyone has questions, or sees holes please let
me know.

In the future I\'ll have a go at gravity control (and Grav Drives), inertial
compensation, and power production and storage.

I\'m a 30yo professional driver (I work for a door-to-door shuttle service),
and have played Traveller since 1977 when Craig bought the game.

I served with the US Army as a light weapons Infantryman, MOS 11B1V76Y if
anyone out there can read these things, and qualified as a sniper.  I\'ve
always been interested in the military in general, and modern military
history in particular, so I\'ve spent much of my life teaching myself history.

I decided not to attend college simply because I don\'t do well in
traditional education.  I have however continued to learn through self research.

In 1995 I was diagnosed with Hodgkin\'s Disease.. After two surgeries and 4
months of chemotherapy I\'m in remission, and plan on staying there.  The
major effect the cancer seems to have had on me is that I don\'t take life
quite as seriously as I used too.

When I\'m not working or playing RPGs, I\'m active in local fandom, work for
gay/lesbian/bi rights, and volunteer as a clinic escort for Planned Parenthood.

That\'s basically the model I\'ve always had in mind, as well -- but the old
British Empire did have a ruling class and a colonial
administrative/military class which had particular cultural, social, and
political values that are important to understand if you\'re interested in
the history of the empire... and what I think I and others have been trying
to get at is what the \'culture\' of the equivalent segment of the Third
Imperium is like.

That\'s one possibility, maybe the obvious one -- on the other hand, being
exposed to "genuinely alien" aliens could just as well cause the collective
attention of the human society involved to turn back in on itself, and
encourage an increased awareness of the importance of various sorts of
divisions and barriers within it.  Looking at contact between previously
isolated cultures in real-world history, you don\'t necessarily find a
leveling of intra-group rivalry -- often quite the opposite.

I was first introduced to Traveller about two years ago, when I borrowed a
whole lot of role playing gear off a guy I knew to look at. He had the MT
system, and while it seemed really interesting, I didn\'t have anyone who
was interested in playing, so I pretty much forgot about it. Later on I saw
TNE in the local RPG shop, and bought it (mainly because I wanted to see
how the civil war had panned out), but again didn\'t do anything with it.
Finally at the start of this year I heard about T4, and curious about it I
bought the special IG had (where you get books 1-4 + JTAS#25 at a reduced
price). I managed to convince several of my friends that this was a cool
system to play, and now run a small group every Sunday night. So, I now GM
Traveller without ever having played a game myself...

	The Man-Boy Love Association is widely controversial (among
Lesbian-Gay groups, as well as psychologists).  It is hardly a reflection
of the larger social system around it.  There also aren\'t that many
memebers.  Child molestation is a universal taboo among cultures, although
individuals and small groups may advocate its practice. Such individuals
and groups have been deemed outside of normative and accebtable behaviour
crossculturally.

	The royal houses of Europe practiced close cousin marriages, not
sibling-sibling crosses.  We do see in history evidence of sanctioned
incest (rare), but almost solely among royalty.  It was politically and
religiously sanctioned in Egypt because the Pharoahs were dieties.  The
rest of Egypt was forbidden such practices.

	No problem <g>.  There are many societies that do practice such
behaviour, and many societies in the past that have viewed such behaviour
within acceptable norms.  I am talking about cultures and societies, not
individuals or small groups <g>.  Homosexuality was never a universal
taboo, and only seems to be a rigid taboo in a few societies.  Human
behaviour encompasses quite a spectrum of phenomena.  I would be veiewed
as barbaric and inhumane in some cultures because I ate pork and I
preferred to bury my dead....

  Think like a business executive: the _only_ value in buying TSR
is the trademark. You can damn well bet that they spent more
money then they are willing to write off buying it. The biggest thing
they are going to want to do is grow the trademark. WotC\'s other
RPGs were just small, we\'ll try this, type things that could easily
be written off against card game sales.
  WotC main claim was they didn\'t have the _staff_ to deal with
other lines. When the aquired TSR they also aquired the staff.
Now they just have to motivate them. :-)

>>No new gamers are buying the product.
>Well that is not exactly true. I have never had any of the previous
>Traveller products, but T4 grabbed my attention enough to buy it.
  You aren\'t a new gamer. A quick browse of your web-site shows that
you have spend significant hobby-time on RPGs. You are, thus, an
experienced gamer who has bought enough of their primary interest
to risk spending a bit of capital to look at something else.
  I mean new, off the street. Some kid who has just seen Star Wars and
heard about role-playing (most likely D&D) and is thinking about getting
into it. Are they going to buy Traveller? I doubt it.
  Blocker one: they have probably never heard of it. IG has spent zippo
on publicity. Can anyone point me to _any_ paid advertisement that they
have run? Without publicity, you only have word of mouth. New gamers
don\'t get word-of-mouth.
  Blocker two: in the rare store that actually stocks Traveller, the backs
of the books tell you absolutely _nothing_ about the product. Eye-catching
artwork is well and good, but if you are going to have to force people to
flip through the book to work out what they hell it is about then there
goes
80% of your potential customers.
  Blocker three: Star Wars. _The_ biggest merchandising engine ever to
hit the streets (yes, bigger than "Tickle-me Elmo :-) is breaking over the
shores of American and even washing up out here in International. If a
kid off the street is going to hear of anything SF it is going to be that.
They
are _much_ more likely to buy that RPG than Traveller. Just like most
new sales will _always_ go to D&D, not, say, Runequest.

>There is no reason why T4 cannot become a real alternative to D&D
>as the first rpg kids buy, and also appeal to older/mature rpg\'ers.
  There is no reason it _can\'t_. It is just, the way they are going, and
they seem rather unlikely (insufficiently capitalised) to change, they
_aren\'t_.
  Show me a business plan to grow a fringe game into something bigger
than D&D. We can compare notes...

Sure..

Lets see.. no fancy degress, just a 2 yr. certificate from a tech
school. Worked for a printer manufacture for 7 years as a Test Tech,
testing the printers (Firmware, hardware and software compatibility)
Recently relocated and joined the "Evil Empire" (Microsoft) as a

as well as a host of other RPG\'s.. much to the scorn of my wife ;)

The metal plate (it was copper) was introduced by the British to stop
the hull rotting because of it being eaten by barnicles. The speed and
toughness increase was a suprise bonus.

The problem with putting metal on a spaceship would be procedural. VDS,
QSDS and SSDS do not support layered armour. It could be done, but it
would be a kludge.

I actually like Full Thrust from Ground Zero Games. It is a simple game,
easy to modify, and very clean in its actions.(And the minitures are
realy cute , very much in the vein of Bab 5 , including a 3 foot space
station!!!!)

Starfire is my second choice, but I pefer the simlicity of FT. 

The only Traveller game worth the effort was Mayday, ant that only
worked at small ship level.

That would have been the Rule of Man more than the Third Impirium. The
M:0 setting would proberbly be rampant palnetary rights at the moment,
as there would be butting heads between what Cleon wants and what the
Imperium would allow him.

Yawn...  

Social problems that occur today will happen in the Far Future, but look
at many sci fi writers today : they take a problem that occurs today and
put a futuristic slant on it. Like the Forever War is a slant on Vietnam
and the Third Imperium being a slant on the rise and fall of Ancient
Rome.

This one is more interesting. Given current aging trends, it is
concievable that in the far future people will tend to live longer,
possably retiring at 100 or laater _Without anagathics_. 

The social and political impact on the imperium would be noticable.
(take the American system, where the Age Lobby has inappropiate power in
elections because they can afford to mobilise their vote more than any
other sector. A strong argument for compulsory voting, al la Australia

IMNSOO, PC is not an issue for the impirium in M:0. The Impirium is a
trade alliance with a strong stick (only WE can make war in space).
Moral delema\'s would still be a planet by planet thing.

Rolepalying social problems is a fine line situation. I have seen it
become a farce or a moving RPG experience. It really depends on the
players how far you want to go with it. IMHO, with most palyers it is
nto far at all.

  Well, that shouldn\'t be a problem, as there are probably very few,
if any, livestock reading the TML.

  OTOH, can anyone see obvious problems with TL based reductions in
L-Hyd requirements as various J-numbers minimum TL is passed, e.g.
at TL10 (+1 TL) Jump 1 would require only 9% of ships\' value to jump?

  BTW, the comment a  while ago about miniguns for spaceship combat was
a (somewhat sarcastic) joke, but the hit probabilities for non-seeking
weapons of differing (non-C) velocities do need to be worked out to address
the sub-munition / bus issue.

I\'m 25 and a networking engineer, playing with middleware and databases. 

Actually I took a 5 years degree in microelectronics so I have a background
in quantium mecanic and cristallography. I specialised myself in Networking
because the microelectonic branch was a little busy, and boring... 
Then I was a teacher in networking during my military duty (1year). And
finally, I\'m working for 2 years in a service company (recently become the
biggest in France) temporary called Sligos-Axime-Marben. I\'m working on a
Win99 project for a French bank, in charge of the middleware and all
general procedures.

I\'ve done some job in an Intranet service for our company and I\'m peronally
programming Visual Basic at home. I\'m building a map displayer for
TNE/Pre-collapse data.

I\'m playing TNE very recently with my girlfriend (damn! my wife from a week
now!). I\'d play Vampire and other WhiteWolf products for 3 years. Before it
was the ADD of course. I handle a RPG club in the University (2 year as
president).

Yeah, and make the product of the two a constant that you cannot improve on
(like quantum mechanical location and momentum relationships). This gives
heightened suspense when exitimg from jumpspace as there will be a certain
timepoint when exactly 7 days (or whatever the mean jumplength is) has
passed. If the ship exits at that time (in milliseconds) it definately has
misjumped so this exact time is dreaded by astrogaters all over the
Imperium. Coin several nicknames for it to add cultural flavor.

I post something that implies interspecies sex and you

Probably they\'re loners who\'ve made the necessary

Throw THAT at your players and let them try to

two aslan, and a vargr. Ack!

I\'ve always assumed there is a wide "Imperial mainstream"
of people who consider themselves "Citizens of the 
Imperium" -- the people whose world-view automatically
includes the interstellar dimension: merchants, military,
scouts, nobles, belters, scouts (anyone notice the pattern?)
etc., the Imperium\'s "Traveller class" if you will -- and
worlds where that view is pervasive (e.g. Regina, Rhylanor,
Dingiir, etc.)

Part of the Imperium\'s mechanism of order and control
is the (near-)guarantee of system-level sovreignty.
By encouraging "local culture" it helps to atomize
any resistance and keep it containable. Lacking an
effective ability to resist Imperial culture, they
can drop out of it with few hassles as long as they 
keep paying their taxes.

Absolutly. Romeo and Juliet were teens. So were

What do the PC\'s do? What is the Imperial "norm"

Absolutely, again.  The PC\'s are hanging out in their
favorite seedy space-ranger bar, when temperence-movement
activists burst in with hatchets. Leading the charge
is the mother of the starport\'s alcoholic mayor/administrator...

The ship hires on an assistant engineer who likes
Pangalactic Gargleblasters too much. This causes 
maintainence problems, maybe a misjump...

Need I go on?

Minus the bile, yes. The Imperial interstellar culture

    'body' => '  Well, here are my comments on the Aprill THUDD Designs.  I\'ll make some
general remarks first, and then get into some more detailed comments on
each design in the section on ratings below.  In general the designs were
very interesting.

  About half the designs were 600T, and another quarter were 500T.  I
think this reflects a relalistic analysis of the situation and mission
requirements.  In general, the 300T and 400T designs were significantly
less capable, and I have generally rated them as such.  This is due to the
minimum sizes of certain equipment, like sensors, com, and controls -
bigger ships in this size range have a higher percntage of hull capacity
to devote to weaponry.

  All but one of the designs is J2 - a look at the J3 design shows why.
While it has greater strategic mobility, it is inferior in other aspects
to the J2 designs (as one would expect).  Given the design criteria of
commerce protection, J2 is enough.

  There was much more variation in M-drives, from 2 up to 6.  Most ships
are 4 or better, which I think is a good thing.  You need to chase down
those pirates, or run away from the big ships - high G is useful.  In
general, I downrated ships with less than M4 and gave extra points for
ships with more than M4.

  I also gave points for hangers - given the stress on fighters in
anti-pirate actions by Cleon I, the ability to accomodate them is
essential.  I also downrated ships without meson screens - the written
requirement for superior defensive capability, along with the requirement
for use in fleet actions, means any design without such screens waould be
less capable.  Finally, I gave extra points to ships that put the crew in
staterooms rather than bunks.  I always liked the idea from 2300AD that
cramped crew quarters gave you a negative DM on crew performance. 

  One thing that peaves me is the number of designers who called their A10
P4 J10 sensor packages "Top of the line."  Not true - the slightly larger
TL12 package of Medium Military Sensors has A16 P5 J16 ratings -
significantly superior in coverage.  I downrated all ships that made do
with the Small Military Sensor package.

  My suspiciaons were confirmed about SSDS vs. QSDS - the best designs
were SSDS designs, since you could add more armor.  One thing that I would
like to put out for discussion is the use of hulls from Wildstars big book
of hulls in QSDS designs.  I think they should not get the QSDS discount,
though they should be allowed for use - the basic hulls given in the QSDS
rules should be the ones that are produced in volume in the Imperium and
subject to the considerable 25% discount.

  Anyway, here are my ratings.

  The J3 capability limits the rest of the armament, particularly the
laser compared to other ships.  I liked the large emergency low
capability, as well as the 30T hanger.  Low manuever and high cost led me
to downrate this design.

  This was a design I really wanted to like - I especially liked the
modules, the high G capability justified by the stacked G-comp, the good
armor, and the nice crew accomadations.  However, this is a real case of
trying to fit a quart in a pint pot.  No meson or dampers, a single laser
(though okay in capability), small sensors, and little cargo space make it
unacceptable.  For not much more money, one can buy one of the 500 T
or 600T ships and not have to choose which module to take along - you have
all the capabilities built in.  

  However, this would make a great PC ship - too bad it doesn\'t work for
this contest.

  Good example of a cheap design - the 400T hull is just large enough to
do some interesting things.  Big problems are the low acceleration (M2),
low sensor ratings, lack of meson screen, and low armor (only 20). One
less laser might help, sinc eht three installed are really hinking big for
a ship this size.

  Nice small design, a good contrast to the Surefire, since it has high G
rating (6G), but fewer less capable lasers and still lacks good sensors or
a meson screen.  These 400T designs are just too compromised compared to
the larger ones.

  I didn\'t check to see if this design was sized for a J drive with the
grapples full - it needs a J drive that will move a 600T standard hull
(540 for SSDS).  I don\'t think the drive is sized correctly, since the
description shows only 50T for fuel.  Otherwise, its cheap, but that\'s its
only good point.  The lasers are shortrange and poor, there is no meson
screen, manuever is only three, and armor is just average (30 points).

  No ratings here - this is my own design and I can\'t vote on it.  If I
could vote on it, I\'d place it in the second tier, just below some of the
best 600T designs, with numbers in the 2s and 3s.  If I had to do over
again, I would have used a 600T hull from the Big Book of Hulls and added
some more dampers, sandcasters, and a slightly larger meson screen, along
with a 20T hanger. 

  Why do I like my design?  Capable lasers (4x1/4-4-3-2), some missiles,
4 sandcasters, a 4 meson screen, a hanger, best standard sensor package,
large staterooms for the crew, reasonable accleration (4G).  The lack of
dampers and low armor let the ship down - the former is a size fault, the
later a QSDS limitation.

  Now we are getting to some good designs - the 600T J2 ones.  Nice cost,
reasonable acceleration, great armor, lots of small craft space (40T
total).  Let down by short range low power lasers, and lack of defense in
dampers and sandcasters.  I also didn\'t like the bunks for the crew.  A
nice design overall.

  A very good buy for the price, let down only by the lack of meson
screens and dampers, as well as inferior sensors.  Does not really
meet the call for superior defense, esp. given the 20 armor rating.  You
get what you pay for, clearly.

  Not bad, but that big honking laser bay is a limitation.  Note that one
can buy a laser battery at TL12 in QSDS that is 50T, just like the bay
weapon, and you get better damage at all but the longest range band, lower
power consumption (about half of the bay weapon), plus that lower power
consumption reduces power plant size and lets you put more stuff in.  Much
cheaper as well.  Only downside is surface area, usually not a factor
unless you want to put grapples outside. 

  Note also the lack of meson screens and dampers, the low sensor rating,
low armor, and average manuever (m4).  Hanger is nice, as are the extra
missiles, and the cost is not out of line.  Again, 500T limits this design
- - 600T would have allowed for better balance.

  This is a very nicely balanced design, with good defense outside of the
20 armor rating (a QSDS thing, as I recall).  Good sensors, high G rating
(5G).  Not perfect, since it lacks a hanger.  Again, the criticism of the
laser bay applies.  I would tweek the laser armament to make it more
evenly distributed, add a hanger, maybe go to M4 or reduce laser power
consumption a bit.  One of the better designs.

  An odd 600T design, let down not only by the lack of meson or dampers
(though the 8, count them, 8 sandcasters makes up somewhat) and the
absence of a hanger, but by the inferior sensors as well.  The odd M2 in
space, M4 orbital also reduced my interest, although it has led to the
high unusualness rating.  It is cheap, but not effective, in my view.

  A solid design, very similar in concept to my own, but with a better
balance of defense with the addition of 2 dampers.  Expensive, though, and
lacks a hanger - I\'d reduce the laser armament slightly and add a couple
more sandcasters.  Not bad for QSDS.

  Well, what can I say?  Familie Spoofulam bit the big one this time - I
predict heads are going to roll at that company!  Oversize, way too
expensive, no meson screen, no damper, inferior sensor, no scoop, no
refine, spartan crew space.  You do get J3 M6, but what can you do once
you get there, aside from shooting off your oversized laser?  Even if it
did meet the design criteria (600T max) it would be an inferior design.
Please note the very low numerical raings are due to the oversize hull - a
similar 600T design would have ratings in the 7s.

  Whre did all the money go on this one?  I almost suspect a broken
calculation when compared to the other designs.  Only J2 M2, no meson
screen, short range lasers, inferior sensors, crews in bunks.  does have
60 armor, but that seems little compnsation.  Could someone point out what
I\'m missing here?  I know Gasbag designs for the Imperial Family, but this
is a bit excessive.

  You will notice I did not give any ship a rating of 1 - while some were
better, I\'ll have to say that all had at least some flaw.  Again, it gives
me an incentive to look at my design again and come up with something
better - a great thing to have happen.

  Comments and rebutals welcome - please take this in the spirit of
constructive criticism in which it was written.  I look forward to hearing
from you.

the equipment and facilities to bring a child to term in complete safety
and psychological balance outside the body exist and are inexpensive?

I\'m sure there will always be those earthy-crunchy radical liberal PC
granola types that insist that there is some kind of "special bond" formed
between the baby and their parent which is sacrificed by the use of an
artificial womb, but these peole should be shot, really, so as not to
dilute the gene pool.

Actually, I wonder if there would be some cultures where you disconnect
from your parents at conception. Those with a real desire to parent become
professionals; raising kids for 8-10 hour per day, 5 days a week and being
paid $70,000 per year, which is what we would do in this culture if we
could afford it, leaving the birth parents to follow their professional
careers.  We would still feel that it is our duty to donate to the gene
pool, and perhaps even visit our children once in a while, but their care
would be part of our taxes, raising each child in a nearly egalatarian
way, no class distinctions, no cultural differentiation, everyone gets the
same chance.

Wow, what a boring society.  Still, this is "science fiction", cultural or
social implications of technology.   

Another high tech issue is unwanted pregnancy.  We are fairly close in TL8
culture to eliminating unwanted pregnancy (in the first world that is),
but can you imagine what the implications would be if we controlled babies
perfectly?  Lots of blue eyes, older parents, more couples without kids at
all.  

What about abortion?  There would be only a very thin line between birth
control and abortion; would removing a fertilized egg from the mother\'s
womb and putting in an artificial womb, never to meet again, be
considered abortion? or adoption?

Whew, that guy  had some good suggestions.  Next week; Geriatric care -
how old do we let em get before we kill our elders for taking up too much

First Subject, what I think of the BSCS.  It\'s quick and dirty, not for 
tabletop use.  There are flaws.  The Jump Drive rule and Power Points or 
some such thing is directly from High Guard.(I don\'t have HG, never got it, 
but I\'m intreaged by it, its my quest item now <G>)  Other than that you can 
use it, modifyed a bit, for a quick ship combat.  I know some players HATE 
long space battles, which was the prob with TNE\'s system.  I personaly HATE 
rolling for location, area hit, calcing dammage then rolling for 
effect...oy!  But still, a higher level of detail is needed.

If you have not seen it, please got to the Missouri archives and find a file 
begining with "rpsc09.pdf" or such.  It was a starship combat system 
designed by Joe Walsh, et al. wich i believe should be included in the 
proposed "Fleet Actions" or "Naval Archetect\'s Handbook" It is a PDF file, 
so you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader (avail for free from www.adobe.com) 
Its got just about everything in clear cut rules. Its a bit more complex 
than the Basic stuff in T4, but still more simple and easier to run than 
TNE.  Joe and company did an excellent job with this, as a matter of fact, 
these rules are one reason why Wildstar updated the USP sheets to detail the 
weapons.  For example a laser does one hit with a certain amount of damage 
i.e. 1/1-0-0-0. a particle does 2 hits, represented with a 2/2-1-1-0.

Its a very good system and I encourage people to at least take a look at it.

Ok now for the 2nd topic, Nukes in Starship Combat.
In both BSCS and even in RPSC0.9 conventional Missiles do 1 dammage, Det 
Lasers do 1d6 hits at 2 dammage, but nukes only do 2?  I don\' think so. 
 Then yesterday I (finaly) got EA.  In the "No Nukes" section a small(?) 1kt 
nuke will do 52 USP Dammage!  That\'s enough to vape almost all civillian 
ships, and even some military and give capital ships some hurt!  Now we see 
why nukes are a BAAAAAAD thing.

Come to think of it, now that theres a weapons dammage conversion to USP 
table my own project of a spinal mounted Plasma Cannon seems almost Demonic! 
(Muhuhahahahahaaaaa!)

So I suppose that Nukes and Antimater Missiles for starship combat may have 
to be changed a bit.  I can easily make a rule for nukes in my campain, Just 
say NO!

Well that\'s all for now, you will notice I am wearing my shiny flame 
resistant black suit, so fire away :)

Well I always hated the 1.5 scale. The players asking how big a room is and
you blurt "About 4.5 meters". When I designed my own design system for
ships etc the first thing I did was stipulating that one displacement ton
was equal to 5 cubic meters which gave me 1x1x2.5 meter squares (the
deckplans are supposed to equate one displacement ton equalling 2st
1.5x1.5x3 m). I could use all deckplans as they were and also gave me feel
of slightly cramped corridors et c that you see on boats.

If I were to choose a scale for mapping in a new RPG I would definately
choose 2 m though. Simplifies melee when most melee exchanges will be in
adjacent squares.

I\'ve always assumed the ticket prices and cargo costs are on a per parsec basis
although this clashes with canon.
I have DMs for the number of passengers available for a certain trip based
on the triptime. Highpassage is -2 per week, midpassage -1 per week and
lowpassage is -1 per two weeks. Incidental cargo is -2 per week, minor
cargo is -1 per week and major cargo is -1 per 2 weeks. Works OK.

One big problem with canon is the prevalence of J1 ships and the importance
of "mains". Both these seem strange if payments is by the parsec instead of
by the jump so the aforementioned change does fuck up some other canon. If
one you\'d disallow deep space jumping (enter/exit j-space has to be at a
gravity well) the mains would be a bit more beliavable but canon clearly
says deep space jumping is possible (Twilights peak for instance).

There was a clear statement to the fact that they were fusion torches in
first edition of HighGuard. An optional rule allowed a fleet at close range
to use their drives as a fusion weapon which automatically put them at long
range the next round. This rule was obvioulsy dropped in 2:nd edition

   Pushing on a mass with a constant acceleration requires a linearly
   increasing power input, as you have seen. If you carry your reaction
   fuel with you, though, you can get a constant acceleration with a
   constant power output: at any instant, in your reference frame, you
   are imparting a constant rate of energy to a contant rate of reaction
   mass.  Bruce explains it well, below.

   Nope.  KE is a scalar quantity; Bruce is exactly right about KE. 
   Kinetic energy is not conserved, it is transformed from and to other
   types of energy (like rocket fuel\'s chemical energy, or a ship\'s
   nuclear energy).  Momentum is a vector quantity; you are right about
   that.  Momentum, unlike KE, is always conserved and is never
   transformed into anything else.

If no units are explicitly stated obviously SI units are used.
kilogram, meter, Joule, Watt, Second etc.
That is the main reason we don\'t use medieval units (inch, pound etc)

Not so as the prebirth environmental factors seem to shape the idividual a
lot more than whats previously thought. The research into cloning of
various animals have surprised researchers about how different they turn
out despite sharing the same DNA.

I started to use the 2m grids in my deckplans, but it just didn\'t work out
very well. I use the "snapshot" system - and it\'s just plain built for 1.5
meter sqaures in terms of movement and time to do things. I adapted it at
one point for T:TNE, but I\'m much happier being back to the "Classic
scales".

No. In some frames of reference the star slows down, and loses kinetic    
energy; in others it speeds up (and gains energy); in all, the rate of
gain of energy has to balance with the power being put into the pusher.

I will admit I was wrong about push-against-the-star drives not conserving
energy, as long as the acceleration goes down as velocity wrt the star
goes up...What I was trying to explain was why the push-against-the-star
drive\'s acceleration goes down as you\'
are moving faster, while a reaction drive that uses the same energy to heat
fuel doesn\'t. In the star rest (or near-rest) frame the kinetic energy
that goes into the star is nearly negligible; energy balance can be treated
just by making the rate of increase of kinetic energy of the ship equal the
power applied, and hence the acceleration goes down with ship\'s speed.
Another way to say it is that at a constant acceleration, a ship\'s rate
of kinetic energy gain goes up with time. So why can a reaction drive

give you constant acceleration at a constant power level? Because the
reaction mass (at each instant) starts out with the same velocity as the
ship and *loses* kinetic energy, since it comes out the "back" of the ship
with a velocity (in the star-system rest frame) lower than that of the
ship.

I\'m not sure this is particularly true. At TL-12, the small ships these
"cruisers" are designed to fight won\'t have meson gun weapons - as many
people have noted, meson guns are nowhere near as good as lasers, either
in T4 or good old BL. Meson guns only start to be worth the space on
2000 T or more ships...and only *really* worth the space on 5000 T+.
By that point, the dinky little meson screen you can put on a 500T patrol
cruiser won\'t protect you at all. Overall, I\'d rather have another laser
turret.

The "nuclear" missiles in T4 are nuclear-pumped x-ray lasers - they detonate
thousands of km away from the target, and lase a bunch of x-rays at it.

The change needed for impact nuclear missiles and antimatter missiles is 
simple: they don\'t work. Decent point defence lasers can\'t possibly miss
incoming missiles at 1000-km ranges - so nuclear missiles will never hit their
target, if it has any lasers working at all. In addition, Traveller missiles
move so fast that the nuclear warhead is almost irrelevant to the damage
they\'d do just by kinetic energy alone...the "Kinetic Kill Missile" beloved
of some on this mailing list. These have the advantage of being cheaper than
nukes, so you can at least dream of overwhelming the targets point defence.

The real question is "What are the *conventional* missiles in T4"...

I have a question for Astrophysicists and armchair astrophysicists.

In "deep space" (that is, an empty hex, or oort belt) I assume it
becomes much more difficult to detect rogue comets, other spacecraft,
and other stuff with passive sensors, since there is basically
negligible reflected energy from the local primary.

So, my question is: Is my assumption valid? Is passive detection of deep
space objects so difficult as to be impossible? What about gravitic
detection?

Next, if a active "sensor sweep" is necessary, what range does an object
need to be in order to be "caught". I\'m sure patience is necessary, to
wait for light propogation... How long would such a sweep take? A lot of
sky needs to be covered.

I ask these questions because of development of my misjump theory, which
states that a certain gravity potential is *required* to exit jumpspace,
which means there *has to be* a (relatively) large gravity well nearby
after a misjump. I wish to know how difficult it would be to find the
rogue comet, planet, or whatever "dark matter" is around in the middle
of an empty hex.

It\'s also an interesting question for battles near "calibration points"
(those deep space secret Imperial Navy refuelling depots)

    'body' => 'I\'m feeling rather querisome today, so I have another topic of
discussion, this time for biochemists, biologists or whomever might have
an opinion. (I know there\'s no shortage here)

A little background might help set the mood. I was at a friend\'s place
yesterday, and amazed her by showing that the touch sensitive lamp she
has doesn\'t work if you tap it with socked feet, it requires bare skin
contact to turn it on. Coincidentally, we were at another house later
on, and noticed the metal-plate dimmer switch which again uses the human
body to complete the circuit.

At the moment, my mind draws a blank when I try to remember the name of
those switches, which are also quite popular in microwave ovens. Anyhoo,
when touching that lamp I wondered out loud whether it would work if I
were a vampire. Like the fact they can\'t be reflected in a mirror, would
they also not be able to use these switches? We also wondered if a cat
would be able to turn on the lamp. (Having cats on the mind, as my poor
companion, Oscar, has had a health problem and has been at the vet under
observation since Thursday. *sniff*)

Twisting this train of thought to Traveller, I assume these switches
would be quite popular on some worlds at certain tech levels, since they
don\'t require any moving parts (afaik) and therefore would be low
maintenence and last quite a long time. I\'m sure all branches of
humaniti, and possibly Vargr (if the hair doesn\'t get in the way) would
be able to use them.

But what about Aslan? Surely yes, they appear to have a similar biology
to humans. (again, unless they have hairy fingertips) But then, would
Hiver? or K\'kree? Droyne?

Now, not being that knowlegeable about the workings of these switches, I
don\'t know if a specific resistance is required, or exactly how
conductive the body part using them needs to be, but it got me thinking
about xenobiology.

Does life *require* that the body be conductive? I suppose not, at least
the outer part. Are electrolytic substances required for life as we know
it? Would some race in charted space be unable to turn on the lights or
operate a microwave on Vland, or Terra, or Sylea?

If a finger-like appendage is used to operate switches, but if it were
covered in a chitin-like substance (fingernails forex) it wouldn\'t be
able to operate the switch. So, would that appendage be touch sensitive?
Do nerve endings require that the appendage be conductive? I\'m not
exactly sure how the sense of touch works, but intuitively, I assume
electrical conductivity is required in order to "feel" things.

I was discovered in year 15, floating adrift in deep space near the Sylean 
Main.  When they pulled me out of cryosleep, My memory was shot.  The Scouts 
believe that I\'m some kind of RoM Relic.  Hell...I dont feel 2043 years old! 
:)

Whoops!  that was the Commander\'s Biog, here\'s the REAL me.

I am a 26.75yr old Web Page Designer.  I work for an international 
educational organization called the Institute of Internal Auditors.  Now 
before you heft your plasma cannons at me let me say that this is NOT the 
Infernal Revenue Service.  These guys are more like beancounters and saftey 
inspectors and such.  What we do is supply educational media and cross 
refence documents on Auditing.

I am a relative newcomer to the Internet, but not to computers.  I didnt get 
\'wired\' untill 1995, but I have used every personal computer from Apple II\'s 
in 1980 all the way to Pentium  clones and even Macs!

Now to the less booring stuff.  I started playing Traveller almost 1 year 
after I got into D&D (1985 btw).  I was interested in a Sci-Fi game, so I 
invented my own based on what I learned in D&D.  It was little more than D&D 
with spaceships and zap-guns.  then one day someone told me of Traveller. 
 This game had it all! from that moment on I was hooked.

Later, like 2 years later, Mega came out.  Alot of good adventures 
remembered were during the rebelion.  You might say I started playing during 
the Transitional Period of the Late Classic Era(Thank you Prof. X!).  This 
means that I have holes in my CT collection, but not many in the MT 
collection. High Guard(sigh) is missing for example.

My main gripe about the other games was that there was no good ship combat 
system, even MT had those ghodawful tables(we used a streamlined house 
variant of MT ship combat)I have been constructing ships since MT, I find it 
interesting to find out how the premade ships work with their own rules, the 
thing I found out was, GDW fudged!

I suppose this is why I am a major advocate for the ISBA.  Starships are a 
major part of any Sci-Fi game.  For most PC\'s its their home.  Knowing what 
you can and cannot do to something that close to your character is rather 
paramount in mine eyes.

T4 to me signaled the rebirth or the orignal CT, I want this baby to fly! 
 Some books  (Starships and First Survey) made me twitch however. But I 
continue to \'evangilize\' and \'spead the gospel of St. Marc <G>\' as much as I 
can. Pushing the game on newbies at conventions.  I got 2 newbies to by the 
game at the last convention I went to :).

Well thats a nutshell in me....er...me in a nut...oh forget it!

Thanks once again for your valued commentary.  I must admit that I was
looking forward to your comments on my and other designs as much as to the
contest itself -- you have a rare skill for spotting and explaining the
weak and strong points of a ship in a few well-chosen words.

You\'re perfectly correct about my (poor) choice of the 50-ton bay laser
for the Tlaxcala;  blame it on my love of big honkin\' weapons. :)  I
should have gone for a battery of turret-mounted lasers totalling 50ish
tons, and used the extra space from reduced power requirements for that
damned missing meson screen. Ah, well, 20/20 hindsight...

In my defense, though, I will point out that that long-range weapon
capability was in part designed to make up for the lowish acceleration,
the theory being "Why chase \'em down?  Destroy \'em from right where you
are." :) 

I too wonder what the deal with Famille Spofulam\'s entry was.  Too much
playing with orbital pogo sticks, I guess.

Finally, I agree with you that Big Table of Hulls entries should be
available in QSDS designs, but that the hull cost should not be
discounted.

Once again, thanks for the intriguing commentary!

Damn, less than a WEEk after I said my area of expertise would never show
up...

These switches, I don\'t know about...but I think it\'s something to do with
induction.

As for life being conductive...on earth, hell yes!

As a f\'rinstance: all neurotransmission, and hence all movement, thought,
etc. depends on the transfer of charged ions,  which said ions can only
operate in an electrolyte. This is why such things as nerve gas are so
damn nasty, they work by either supressing the calcium channels (you
paralyze to death) or by overloading them (you twitch to death).

All transport of material into and out of cells is dependent in some part
on transfer of charged ions, in a non-electrolytic environment cells die.

Worse, this makes everything but plant cells are dependent on osmotic
pressure for stability and, to some extent, shape. You dump mammalian
cells in distilled water, they swell up and pop. You dump them into
excessivly salty water, they shrivel up like raisins.

Either is bad for the cell. As go the cells, so goes the multi-cellular
organism.

Now, the outer covering that an organism uses will be more or less
conductive, as you have deduced. Chitin is not conductive, skin is. Cats
are somewhat conductive, but their fur, or their rough pads aren\'t
conductive enough to triger the switches used in these lamps.
Fortunately...I have four cats!

This is an arguement I stridently disagree with.  If the PD fire
rules don\'t provide this effect, then they do work.  I like the idea
of having good rules in place for real nuke missiles, then we have
PD knock all of them out before they hit.

Look, for example, at the lower tech lasers available.  This would
be easy to saturate with missiles.  Also, if you don\'t have rules
for the nukes, there is no reason why people will bother with PD
lasers.  How many of the THUDD designs so far are covered with high
ROF dedicated PD weapons?  See what I mean?

So, IMO, we need damage rules for all missiles, then PD rules that
take your point into account.  Note that if you can hit a few
hundred missiles with one laser at close ranges, I can fly my ship
to a farther range (still fairly close) and hit another ship
hundreds of times.

This is an interesting problem to solve.

True, but at lower CVs, nukes would have a place----a "following
battle" for example (chasing ships out to jump point, for example).

I\'m not quite done my ratings, but I\'ll respond to mark\'s comments at

Well, it was kind of funny - the spec said M2, but of course, you\'d want
M4 or better. M2 or M3 might be aqequate and M3 doesn\'t require you
to install g-tanks or crush the crew.

Hm, I suppose... I always pictured it a bit more like a sub/modern naval
ship (which I honestly know little about) where the crew goes in for
a cramped stay of a known duration - maybe 3 months, tops. it is, after
all, primarly a patrol craft operating out of some base and not a long
range attack cruiser.

Does this exist in SSDS, or just QSDS? I try not to mix them...

I saw armor as the primary defence mechanism, so yes, SSDS would be best,
followed by sandcasters and nuclear dampers. Somewhere else you mentioned
penalizing ships without meson screens... if the primary actions are
against pirates, then why would you need a meson screen? If you\'re up 
against anything that you need a meson screen to survive against, you\'re
outclasses anyways. I thought ships should have had a min. of 50 armor,
which is more than enough to survive a fight with a few pirates.

I\'ll only comment on my own design...

Yes, I screwed up the laser calculations. The lasers should be a lot better.
That may not be all that I messed up, but I know that for sure... :(

  You are far too kind - thanks for your support.  I\'m not sure why I do
these commentaries - it\'s really more for my own benifit than for others.
I find it forces me to write down and justify my thoughts, and I often
take three or even four looks at a design to make sure I\'m saying the
right thing.  Really helps when I do my own ships.
 
  I\'m begining to think that the way THUDD really should work is more like
the way NASA and other government agencies do large contracts like this.
Rather than one round of designs, there should be two.  After the first,
the best three or four or five should be given a chance to redesign, based
on the comments from the voters.  The resulting ships would then be voted
on again.  Frankly, I think this would get us better designs, because the
final version would be better for the other\'s criticism.

  This idea would be particularly appropriate in this case, since none of
these designs (my own included) are perfect.  The ideal design would use a
SSDS designed hull with about 50 points of armor, systems to J2 M4, and
then would be stuffed with a proper mixture of weaponry.  Ah well, we can
only hope. 

  What might be even better is what NASA and the American military often
do - get companies to combine proposals.  What Generica would really like
to do is find a firm with a highly armored hull and install some of its
own QSDS components inside.  Any support for this idea of companies
combining expertise?

  Well, I\'d buy this if there was a great deal of difference between the
two weapons - as I recall performance is within one point of damage at all
ranges.  Frankly, I have no idea why the QSDS TL12 laser bay weapon
exists, aside from saving hull area - it\'s inferior in every other aspect.

  Maybe the recoil from all those big honkin\' handguns scrambled some
brains - I can\'t wait for the press release.

  Glad you agree - maybe we can make this official .

  You are welcome - glad to be of service.

  Now, my other comments about low manuever, lesser quality sensors, no
meson screen, and bunks for the crew still apply, but it sure seems like
these lasers should do more damage, at least compared to some QSDS
designs.  This may be related to that laser rating discussion I\'ve been
seeing recently - hope someone can fix it.

Certainly, at high speeds high-explosive warheads arn\'t too
useful.  However, nukes give over 300 000 times the yield of
high explosives (based on the MT 70 Kg 12 kiloton ship\'s missile).

Nukes, since they\'re not going as fast as kinetic kill munitions,
have an easier job of guiding themselves to their target.  If
surrounded by decoys (inflated aluminium balloons) and chilled to 4K,
I think they do have a fair chance of beating point defence.  Passive
sensors won\'t see it because it\'s cold and small, especially when the
point defence lasers start blowing decoys to plasma.  Active sensors
will see it, but also all of the decoys.  It\'ll show up like a sore
thumb on a fish using a densitometer, but maybe densitometer\'s don\'t
have the resolution to pinpoint it.

I\'m also not sure where these kinetic kill missiles are getting their
kinetic energy from.  It can\'t be from turret launchers, though a
long spinal accelerator at high g-s can give a respectable energy
(1GJ/Kg).  Certainly the missiles themselves can\'t carry that much
energy for a reaction drive.  Let\'s ignore energy-creating thrusters
for a moment :).  The simplest way of storing lots of energy in the
missile seems to me to be by putting a nuke in it.

It amazes me how many players of this game are from such technical and
scientific backgrounds. I\'m no gearhead, but I love a good realistic set of
game mechanics and I\'m an astronomy buff.

I\'m married and have two kids (a daughter, 4, who wonders what the heck is
so fun about playing some weird game called "Traveller"; and a son, 2, who
is every bit into his "terrible twos," thank you very much!).

I\'ve been playing Traveller since about 1980, almost always cast in the
role of referee. I have run the following campaigns:

CT - "The Sparrowhawk Campaign," based on the exploits of the crew of a
Daryen  trader/escort hybrid, in the Spinward Marches. The ship bore an
uncanny resemblance to the Millenium Falcon. What can I say? I was about 13
and impressionable! Never ran the Adventure 1-4 set, but I did thoroughly
enjoy conducting "Divine Intervention," part of one of the old "Double
Adventures." I also ran a long-term Solomani Rim campaign based on the
exploits of some Terran subversives bent on overthrowing the Imperial
occupation government.

MT - "Knightfall" and "Hard Times," both published by GDW. Using the
starship Gimuqshabika from Knightfall, I ran the same crew of players on
both these campaign settings since they occur relatively close to one
another (Massilia and Diaspora sectors, respectively). It took about two
years to do both. I was going to put the same group on "Arrival Vengeance,"
but we didn\'t get around to it before we got interested in TNE.

TNE - "The Hessians Campaign," a mercenary campaign based in Deneb sector
of the Regency. This has so far been my magnum opus campaign with more
setting and adventure development by myself and attention to detail than
I\'ve ever invested before. We\'re hooked on TNE mechanics and my group
hasn\'t expressed interest in converting to T4, partly because of the shoddy
editing and, in our minds, overly simplistic rules. When TNE first came
out, I tried to conduct an RCES campaign, but it just didn\'t take. The
Regency Sourcebook was a godsend and IMHO is to date, the best Traveller
book ever published.

T4 - Bought the book, wasn\'t impressed, but might buy the "fixed" book with
all "Erratta" <g> taken out. The fact that I\'m considering this purchase
makes me think of the old saying, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me
twice, shame on me," however. I hope MM and crew don\'t dissappoint.

To which I say

It appears that most colonies would start small and that there would 
generally be more than one per world.
The strange theng about colonies (although it is perfectly sensible) is 
that the population all arrive at one point and fan out from there.  The 
opposite occurs on origin worlds (of which I would suspect there are damn 
few anyway) and cities grow from surrounding population rather than the 
surrounding population growing from the city/colony.

The only colony based game I have used so far is 2300 and almost all worlds 
had multiple colonies on them.  Surely these would have maintained their 
individual identies even over periods of reduced capability.  Some would 
have merged into single World Spanning Governments, but not most.

And I say

You are right about each GM having to flesh out a lot of the details and I 
wouldn\'t have it any other way but....
....Do we not need some consistancy to flesh out suitable worlds to make 
the adventures we play similar enough that we can use the published 
material so that all of us do not have to completely re-invent the wheel.

And before I get flamed - let me say I am not advocating all following the 
same strict path (or even be in the same ballpark) because we might as well 
just play one of those computer games - but I am saying that let us be able 
to use the resource material that we all generate.

	Agreed re the lack of scoop/refine and medical facilities.  Serves
me right for not reading the spec.  As well, in retrospect, I\'d probably
make it just J-1 or 2 tops, and put in a bigger power plant and more
lasers.  Oh, and maybe a sickbay or a refining plant :).  As a rescue
vessel, it\'s completely useless.  I showed up on Baywatch in a destroyer;
so sue me :).  However, I still think that for piracy suppression, it\'d be
highly effective; my reasoning is as follows:

	Most pirates are not going to have access to TL-12 military weapons
or sensors, and in many cases T-plates.  Even where they have T-plates, 6G
pirates will be an oddity.  In many cases, they\'re operating with kitbashed
ships, out of out-system hidey-holes, and don\'t have access to regular
supplies of parts or ammunition.

	Therefore, a patrol cruiser is going to be up against something
with relatively low acceleration, with a weapons suite that probably
emphasizes lasers rather than missiles (since hydrogen to fuel them is
cheap and plentiful, whereas missiles are somewhat harder to obtain),
although missiles will still be encountered, and probably inferior sensors.
Given that Meson guns only come in at TL-11, and are the sort of thing
encountered on BB\'s, not corsairs, meson screens are probably not going to
be needed.

	Under these circumstances, the ideal way to proceed is <Python
Alert> to follow the basic principles of L\'lap Goch, the ancient Welsh art
of self-defence=81, and pound the crap out of your target before it even
knows you exist.  Which the Bludgeon can do, thanks to its heavy long-range
armament; it can hit an opponent at long range, starts getting to be pretty
dangerous at medium range, and up close it\'s doing 8 & 6 with the PA gun
and lasers.

	As well, the PA gun has the advantage of not being affected by
anything short of a Black Globe, and rolls twice on the damage effects
table under RPSC.  Even if all 5 lasers are devoted to missile defence,
it\'s still more lethal at close range than some of the other entries.
Given its 6G accelleration and heavy armament, I think that it\'d mop the
floor with an average corsair (or several of them, for that matter), could
take out several of the other entries, and stands a fair chance against
most of them (of course, it does have 100 tons more in which to do it with,
so it has something of an unfair advantage).  The problem cases would be
the missile-armed ones; even then, the trick would be to stand off (using
its higher accelleration to maintain ideal range), use sandcasters against
his lasers, shoot down the missiles as they come, and snipe with the PA
gun.  The opponent couldn\'t defend against the PA gun, whereas you\'d have a
shot at stopping his offense (weaker than yours at those ranges anyhow) and
what you don\'t stop, well, you\'ve still got armour 40.

	So basically, in response, I agreee that all it can do is fire off
its big gun, and that it\'d be abysmal at non-combat tasks.  And I agree
that it shouldn\'t win whatever ASCII masterpiece is being handed out this
time around; I missed far too many design criteria for that.  However, as
far as being able to handle the more combat-oriented parts of its mission,
I think that it\'s a little more effective than you give it credit for.

	Anyhow, I have to go study.  I\'d be interested in seeing what
people who know more about Traveller space combat than I do have to say
about this...  In fact, it\'d be really tempting to game this out at some
point.

Interesting.

I knew life required electrolyte on earth, what I wonder about is
whether all extraterrestrial organisms require it. Can anyone imagine a
mechanism for neural transmission (thought) that *doesn\'t* require an
electrolyte?

Offhand, the only Traveller alien I can think of that qualifies is the
cymbaline chips (protovirus ;-) My belief is that pretty much all
oxygen-breathing life requires it. As for the Brin or those
Jagd-id-jadgemumble *cough* types, who knows?

Ick. A xenobiology thread could get ugly real quick. In terrestrial
life, oxygen is carried by hemoglobin, which is iron based. Spock uses a
copper-based carrier. (Dunno if that\'s feasible tho\') I imagine that
salinity levels differ between different aliens, possibly within
different branches of humaniti.

I suppose if that were the case it would decrease chances of
inter-fertility...

It occurs to me that the TML in general puts a lot of thought into how
future technology works, how future and alien societies work, but not as
much time gets spent (wasted) imagining how alien metabolisms work...

Thoughts - fromthe top of my head

Obvious bugs are:
Sandcasters
References to Energy Points.
The QSDS.

I really think that the bugfixed QSDS should be used as the basis for this.
The construction rules define how the ships behave and the rules need to
consider them.

Let\'s keep it simple - although good, the TNE system was too intense for
basic rules.

Let\'s keep it abstract - we want this as a \'basic\' system. A dedicated game
like BL is the solution to more detail. I don\'t want hex grids for the
average RPG session...

Thats all for now - Dom

Note- Someone mentioned that the phrase \'battle line\' was wrong for 3D ship
combat. I agree that the phrase is wrong, but I still envisage formations
(planes and other geometric forms) of warships, shielding a reserve... Very
Doc Smith, I know! \'Battle Line\' is just an abstract way of expressing this.

Not really. Started playing 1983, two favourite games are Traveller and
Runequest (CoC and Cyberpunk, T2300, come in quite a bit further down the
field!). Interesting how you and I both like the games with the nice

I think the Tranq idea is out of Cherryh "Tripoint" and "Merchanter\'s Luck"

the going insane (HPPE? or one of the Abyss Rift ones in Challenge? Lost my

I\'m 25 and graduated with a Masters in Mechanical Engineering from the
University of Southampton (UK) and immediately started work at a company
that is in the late stages of developing a practical flywheel energy

systems). My main responsibilities are taking prototype units from design
through to testing and eventual disposal. I\'ve also spent time supporting
marketing, and unfortunately seem to have become the unofficial IT support

designing and project engineering on nuclear facilities, particularly
reprocessing and waste disposal plants.

I\'ve just (read \'this weekend\') moved into the first house which I haven\'t
rented with my \'significant other\', who is mad enough to teach 11-16 year

of obtaining the CT and MT stuff that I\'ve lusted after for years. I bought
TNE, just for the background and would really like to know what was behind
that Black Curtain! I\'m restraining myself on T4 until they get the product
quality sorted (thanks to the US getting the products first I get some
great reviews!). I also play/run RQ, T2300, and Cyberpunk, and regularly
play \'not-AD&D\' our homebrew system.

Other interests include a variety of sports, and trying to sort out a HTML
version of the library data from MT and CT for use by my players on my Mac
Powerbook.

Actually, keeping a boy for sexual purposes has been practiced
openly.  The term catamite was coined to refer to such boys.

You think normal terrestrial biology is any neater than xeno?? ;-)

Actually IIRC I think there are some forms of life here that use copper in
an analogous way to iron...I\'m pretty sure they\'re all bacteria though.
And chlorophyll actually has a magnesium based \'heme\' molecule at it\'s
core structurally very similar to the heme moiety of hemoglobin. I\'d have
to look back at my biochem books to make sure, though.

	Fighters would be best against pirates in settled systems where 
fairly large numbers of them could be used to scour big regions of space 
without needing a lot of more expense SDBs.  For a patrol crusier they 
don\'t make much sense because they are a very expensive way of adding 
armament or extending sensor range.  In the first case you\'re better off 
with turrets and in the second you\'re better off with sensor drones.  
Yes, fighters have a longer range than drones, but they\'re also a lot 
more expensive.  As an admiral, I\'d rather be able to have a cheaper 
patrol ship that I can buy more of, than the ultimate in patrol ships 
that I can barely afford.

	IMHO, this is wrong.  Meson guns are very poor weapons until they 
get quite large.  No ship would bother with an MG small enough to be 
stopped by your screen, and any MG big enough to be worth it would find 
an MS small enough to fit in a patrol cruiser totally insignificant.
	Nuclear dampers are poor design choices for similar reasons. 
Contact & Proximity missiles (missiles that need to either touch or get
within a few km of their target) are very susceptible to point defenses. 
Even a regular laser turret can kill several at likely closing 
velocities.  
	For this reason, all military missiles are probably nukes and
equipped to be used as detonation lasers.  If faced with a target that has
formidable Point Defenses (PD) then the missile can be used as a det-laser
from outside of PD range.  If the target has weak PD but working Nuclear
Damper (ND) turrets or screens, then the missile can try to hit the ship
directly as a Kinetic Kill Missile (KKM).  If the target has weak PD and
weak ND then the missile can close and detonate as a Nuke.
	The problem with NDs on small ships is that a nuke missile that 
has had its nuke trigger dampened can still be a KKM, and small ships are 
likely to take multiple criticals from KKMs.  As a result, NDs don\'t 
really do small ships any good.  A laser turret on the other hand, can 
shoot down more missiles than an ND can damp, and is also the only thing 
that will stop a KKM.  So, what small ships need as defense against 
missiles, is lots of LTs.  (The reason I didn\'t say anything during the 
Merc Crusier THUDDD was because I figured the NDs were for defending the 
troops.)
	BTW, the reason you haven\'t seen anything about KKMs or Prox 
Nukes in any rules yet is \'cause they can be pretty complicated 
and we (the beta list) haven\'t figured out how to simplify them for 
anything but Gearhead combat.  We\'ve made some advances though, and if we 
get the go ahead from IG, I expect that we could make both a detailed and 
a simplified system that were compatible and also better than the 
current system 
	IMHO, the best way to add additional defense to a small and fast 
ship is to add lots of sandcasters.  These help against lasers, 
PAWs, and det-laser missiles.  The best offense for a small ship is 
lasers since they do the most damage for the volume/MCr/MW, and can also 
be used for missile defense.
	For those who like to put missiles on your ships, make sure you 
include enough to overcome the lasers on any likely target.  Even for 
det-lasers, figure on each laser turret killing one of your missiles and 
see if you have any left over afterward.  Maximizing volley size is the 
key.  This usually requires MFDs.

	I agree that hulls on the Big Book of Hulls shouldn\'t get the 
discount, but I think that whatever hull becomes the basis for the 
Imperial Standard Patrol Cruiser would by _definition_ be included in 
QSDS.  After all, the Patrol Cruiser will be a common ship throughout the 
Imperium, and what is QSDS but a catalog of ship components in common use 
throughout the Imperium?

	I realize that you may be simplifying so as not to burden the TML 
with one of the Beta-lists interminable discussions, but if you throw 
enough missiles at a ship simultaneously its PD can be overwhelmed.  Of 
course, this is only likely to be worthwhile if the attacker cannot field 
sufficiently large spinal mounts or is really desperate or the ship 
designer has neglected PD.

	This isn\'t quite true any longer.  The original KKM calculations
needed to be corrected.  Proximity nukes are now better than KKMs of the
same mass, particularly against very large ships that may have enough
armor to defeat KKMs entirely and which intercept more of the nuke\'s
radiant energy.
	I should point out that the damage in EA for nukes is (I believe)
for stuff in physical contact with it when it detonates. This is very 
unlikely to happen in ship combat where missiles and ships are moving at 
100+km/s relative to each other.  The best nuke missiles are likely to be 
able to do is detonate within a few hundredths of a second of the target 
(a few kms).  This is plenty close and will seriously hurt most ships and 
fry all surface fixtures facing the explosion.

Or there abouts, yes I would...if the game was intended to be campy.  In
one game I\'m in right now the nastiest villian is named Sid Nastie...Nastie
because he *is* nasty, and Sid for the famous Sidney Whiplash.

Isn\'t most everything we actually use in Traveller? ;->

You\'re tell me? ;->  It\'s worse than a kludge, it\'s *broken*, slap-dab
broken.

We\'ve *got* to return to a linear scale like TNE\'s, because it\'s not just a
matter of purposely layering armor, there are also the cases of: Sensor
Array-AV3 on surface; Hull Armor-AV20; and Interior Bulkhead-AV6.  A hit on
the surface of a ship first hits the Sensor Array which absorbs *some* of
the damage, it continues on through the hull armor, carrying away most of
the rest of the DV, it causes damage to the interior compartment and is
finally stopped by the internal bulkhead.  Try modeling that with what we
have now!

Having said that, I\'d *really* like to keep final AV\'s in the same ballpark
(15 to 70) that we have now.  Triple digit AV\'s, require us to produce
weapons with triple digit DV\'s.  Would somebody like to *fix* this?

I agree with both of you.  Yes, we need rules in place for nukes, and yes
decent point defence lasers (and counter-missiles) should knock them
out...*almost* all of them anyway.  

As I understand it, nearby explosions of even *big* nukes won\'t do much
damage from blast..lots of potential radiation damage though. All that
radiation worries me.

Oh, and that reminds me...what about sheilding from normal cosmic rays,
especially the very energitic ones?  Just how much armor is even an
unarmored ship going to have to have just to keep it\'s crew alive..not to
mention fertile?

	I\'m 34, currently in the employ of Uncle Sam, married to my BEST friend
Michelle, have two war chihuahuas (Poco and Meko). I\'m staying (for now) in MD
(APG, to be specific), working my duty at a Army test facility (God, is it ever
boring), studying for my degree, reading my Traveller books (all the mods), and
trying to be a good husband.

	I roughly began playing around 1980, after a bad ADnD experence. We
bounced around the Top Secret world, Bushido, Star Trek (tm), and tried Star
Fronters (T$R\'s vain attempt into SFRPG), but ended up in the CT expansese and
the SCA.

	After a hitch in the retail game, I got the wonderlust bug, said I would,
and let Uncle Sam give me a job (actually, not too bad. Where else can you shoot
the competition AND its legal?). They sent me overseas twice (well, actually
three (3) times but SA doesn\'t count - it was an FTX with live ammo for nine
months) and got to see alot of Europe (first in Mainz, then in Augsburg), and
the european homested of my family. Just wish I could have seen the Scot side of
my dad... I\'m an MP, been one for 9 years, getting ready for Staff Sergeant, and
making my way through the quagmire that is APG.

	I hope to get my degree in buisness management (maybe in spelling too),
with minors in computing and history. My wife has hers in PR, but wants to
upgrade to accounting. I have an avid love in reading, my addiction (my/our
(sorry,hon) PC), writing (still working on that great Traveller novel...),
weights, running, star watching, and what else I have time for. \'Chele likes
about the same, less running, but adds quilting (she made me this cool penguin
quilt - I OWE HER BIG TIME)

	I am not a math god (the wife balances the chechbook), scientist of any
sort, or a guru. Heck, I have problems answering questions on the phone. I guess
I\'m a bit of a conservitive/libertarian, but leaning towards pragmatisium. And,
I listen to Denis Miller (he was born in my hometown - Pittsburgh). 

	I like this digest/forum. You all give me TONS of ideas, insight into the
world of Traveller, and let me be a part. Kinda like a cyberhood. Keep up the
dialog, it\'s a hoot.

	I don\'t have a character profile, but I used to. Alas, it has changed
since 1982. I don\'t know for the better, or , the worse. I\'m not the spry
harrier I used to be...

	A little bit about myself:
	I\'m a 21 year old bartender/student in Kansas. Played around 
with a lot of physics in high school (quantum mechanics was so cool!) 
and have studied computer science, history, literature, and organic 
chemistry in colledge. I\'ve also done some independent study in 
economics, sociology, psychology, barcraft, and Japanese (though I\'m not 
particularly fluent in it). I\'m leaving in less than a month for boot 
camp (going to be an intel linguist for the Marine Corps), and haven\'t 
been able to find a local gaming group to play in.
	Got started on TNE, and loved the reclaim-the-lost-empire 
/explore-the-galaxy sort of atmosphere there. I\'m glad they brought back 
the trade and intrigue angles more heavily in T4, but I think I like the 
task system for TNE better than T4 (but the D66 system is better than 
both).

	One thing I ought to caution you about (to whomever wrote the 
BR-spinoff SCS - I subscribed in digest, unfortunately) : If SI is 
related to ship length, this makes short, wide ships less structurally 
sound than long, thin ones. While I would agree that a needle shape 
would have more longitudinal strength, it would probably not have the 
same lateral strength as a ship with comparable g strength in, say, a 
sphere shape. Something to think about.

	Also, tying initiative to tactics sounds good to start, but 
discounts the ability of a competent officer to keep individuals working 
in a concerted manner - the differnece between a well-oiled machine and 
a motley band of adventurers. After all, it was superior unit cohesion 
that lead to Caesar\'s success in his northern campaigns, in spite of his 
tactical errors (I remember this from my history, but only in 
generalities. If anyone has specifics, please hop in). I think 
initiative should be modified by both tactics (knowing what to do) and 
leadership (getting others to do it); perhaps tactics, to a maximum of 
leadership (or some multiple thereof)?

	I almost feel somewhat overwhelmed by the expertise on TML...

in Traveller terms. If someone wants to generate a template based on a
Traveller model, let me know.  Who knows, we may generate some good
NPC=92s!

Here is my first pass:

Currently I am 34 years old. I started playing Traveller about 1980.
Other games include most military board games, computer sims, and a few
other role playing games.

Joined the US Navy after I failed first year of collage. Spent four
years working on F-14 Tomcats as an Aviation Fire Control Technician.
Graduated up to Troubleshooter and ended up being responsible for 12
Cats. Saw action in Beirut twice, Grenada, and Oman. Did become involved
with several strange "special duties" that took me to some weird places.

After that tour joined the UCMC. I had worked with them several times
and was always impressed. Started out as a truck driver until they
figured out what to do with me. Found out that I knew a little about
computers and ended up with the Fire Direction and Control section with
Arty. (Both the old 105=92s and 155=92s) They sent me to collage at the
University of Virginia and right before I was to graduate, was sent to
the Gulf War. Fought in 4 of the 5 major actions during the four day
war, and as a result now look like a Vargr Admiral when in uniform.=20

Returned to the states and finished collage with a degree in English
history. Got out of the Marines and started to work in advertising as an
Account Executive on several accounts. (Most famous ad involved with:
Bud Frogs) Switched agencies several times and decided that most of the
people in advertising were business illiterate. Started a small
consulting firm called AMG to tell advertising agencies how to run their
business. Currently my partner and I have 14 people on staff and clients
in Europe, the far east, and all over the states.=20

What all this means, I don\'t have a clue.

right.=20

Your T4 book will be as useful as it always was, of course.  :)  Or, to 
put it another way, it will be as useful as 1st Edition AD&D currently is...

T4 Deluxe has the changed task system - changed as given in the T4 Game 
Screen.

T4 Deluxe will have a task library, more vehicles, a cleaned up QSDS, and 
hopefully no typos.  

There will be lots of changes to layout.

There will be some new material on starports, which was posted here a 
month or more ago by Marc Miller.

Just keep paying attention to the list - you\'ll see messages from Marc 
now and then, when he wants feedback on something he\'s considering (i.e., 
he previewed the task system here, the vehicles list, and the Starports 
chapter, all for comment from list members).

Pocket Empires, which was written by CORE (i.e., Andy Lilly, Stu Dollar,

knowledge.

Sorry, I try to keep everyone informed of everything, but I find myself 
spending all my free time writing these days.  I\'ll try to do better.  
But, I don\'t have unlimited time, unfortunately.  Every minute I spend 
here is one less minute I can spend writing the latest supplement - which 
means delays for all of us in the long run..

For the record, Pocket Empires should ship within the next couple of 
weeks.  Anomalies should be shipping next month.  Psionic Institutes 
should ship at the end of next month (that\'s what Stu and I are working 
on right now - we\'re about 3/4 done, and plan to be finished by the end 
of this month, or a few days thereafter).

I suppose an electron-transfer mechanism similar to that used in
photosynthesis _might_ work, though I suspect this wouldn\'t propagate
nearly as well as a mechanism using an ion gradient.  It would be extremely
fast if it did work.  The ion gradient lets the organism actively pump
against the gradient when the nerve is at rest, and then more or less let
things fall naturally when firing (okay, that\'s a bit simplistic but
basically correct).  Electron transport takes a lot more active energy and
the coordination of many enzymes.  

For any of you bio-gearheads (squish-heads? :) ) out there, how about
long-chain impulses based on a model similar to muscular contraction?  A
transmitter changes the shape of a protein at one location, and this causes
an actin-like configuration change in a spreading pattern, which, if strong
enough, could propagate along a protein fiber, like a verrrrry long muscle
fiber.  Again, I don\'t know whether such chains would hold up well over
more than local distances.  Ion transfer does make a lot of sense.  

Oooh, what if you posited an organic conductor made up of intracellular
protein nano-tubes, down which either electrons (metallic ions?) or small
transmitter molecules travelled, not unlike a bullet zipping down a rail
gun, using protein configuration to electrically propel it down the
channel.  This _might_ be slower than terrestrial Na/K/Ca transfer, but in
a low-ion (high-metal?) environment, it might actually work.  

Other ideas?

you enjoy it and -- I\'m sorry. :)  It wasn\'t implemented precisely as
designed, and while it\'s successful and many people have played it for
(literally) thousands of hours, it feels just a bit too much like an Ed

the Wright brothers airplane; it got off the ground for a few seconds, but
it\'s not the F15 I wanted it to be. :)  

I\'ve been designing and playing games since I was about 12, and after years
working as a programmer and consultant finally managed to turn it into a
"career" if you can call it that.  

I\'m currently working on several game designs, all more or less in the
science fiction genre, ranging from somewhat to very role-playing oriented.
 Yes, Traveller is a great inspiration.  :)

Yeah, I know. What I really liked about the Dumarest books was the
atmosphere. In some ways the post CT stuff feels too \'comfortable\' - it
seems to focus on the wealthy PC, with most parties at least part-owning a

Everyone with the slightest pretense to a classical education knows that
the foe of the RCMP and nemesis of Dudley Dooright was named *Snidely*
Whiplash.  "Sid Nastie" sounds more like a long-dead punk star.

I added something to the tREC Archangel design I would like some feedback
on -- the
reconfigurable laser batteries. The Archangel has 3 MFDs and 15 laser
turrets. As a
nominal configuration, I assigned 5 turrets to each MFD. However, I added
the option for
the crew to redistribute the turrets. By assigning all 15 to a single MFD,
the ship obtains a
significant punch even at long ranges. from 3x (+4) 1/6-5-3-2 to 1x (+4)
1/10-9-7-4. (I
missed Wildstar\'s errata on a negative adjustment for ROF 10. Could someone
sent it to
me or could IG add a Starships errata to their web page?)

My question is: Are the reconfigurable batteries allowable and how long
should it take to
reconfigure them. I stated that it would take a few hours. Should  it be
possible to
reconfigure the batteries more quickly, say during a battle?

I would also like to comment on bunks for the crew. Given a choice between
more
firepower and more comfortable sleeping quarters, I think the decision for
a warship 
would always be more firepower. Even on a larger ship, the larger crew
would still make
this a clear cut choice. (I just watched "Das Boat"; at least I\'m not hot
bunking, although
....) A patrol cruiser would generally be in a situation where the crew
could either take
R&R on one of the really big ships in the fleet, or, in anti-pirate
missions, visit a friendly
port. Also, in some cultures, community sleeping might be considered the
norm. In
medieval Europe, for example, privacy was not all that common.

	And has been met with degrees of persecution and revulsion.  In
some cultures (several tribes in New Zealand), sex with a boy is accepted,
but only if he is older than 12 (or so).  Usually, it is ritualized as
keeping the strength and potency among men.  Many cultures have
unofficially condoned sex with younger men, but there is/was a limit to
age.  By child molestation, I am referring to NB to 8 years or so.  Does
anyone know the offical WHO definition?

I\'ve been playing RPGs since 1983 (it might have been 82) after a terrible
experience with Runequest and then bought one of the first Traveller books
in Sweden (third copy, that is). I\'ve been a GM ever since in games
including Traveller (all kinds except TNE that isn\'t Traveller IMHO),
Bushido, CORPS, FUDGE, SLUG, Teenagers from outer space, Mekton II, It
came from the late late late show, Albedo, Dream, Time Lord, Dr Who, Prime
Directive, FTL 2448, DC Heroes, Amber, Prince Valliant, Toon, Over the

I am 28 (29 in August). I got myself a BS in Comuter Science back in -89
and started working as a programmer/systems engineer at the place where I
made my thesis at. Made my military service year while working part time
for the same company since I had a posting that gave me a week off every
once in a while (almost half of the time, actually).=20

In late -90 I moved from Ume=E5 in the north of Sweden to V=E4ster=E5s in t=
he
middle of Sweden (it is actually in the sothern third of Sweden) and
started to work for a big company as a programmer/systems engineer.

In fall -94 I needed a break and got myself a temporary leave of absence
from work to study some more back in Ume=E5. I\'m getting myself a MS in
Engineering and Computing Science starting from scratch. I have studied at
an increased pace so that I will finish in three and a half or four years
instead of four and a half+ years while working part time as
tutor/instructor at the department of computing science. I still have to
go down to V=E4ster=E5s in the summer holidays and work though...

    'body' => '  Nice to see so many responses to my comments - I love a good discussion.

  First, an apology about sensors.  As you folks well know, I use only
QSDS, so I am not familiar with SSDS.  I did not know that there is no
Medium Military Sensor package in SSDS - odd that QSDS would have a real
advantage like that.  Anyway, it seems to me that the QSDS package should
be available to SSDS designers in the future.  I looked at my ratings an
found that this would not change the way I rated the designs, even if the
SSDS ships had the better sensors installed, so I stand by my ratings.

  The most notable set of comments was about my stand on meson screens.
First, I agree that pirates will be unlikely to have meson weapons, except
perhaps for some pirate bases that have relic deep meson sites (the Milue
0 book has at least one mention of such a planet).  However, this ship
design was _not_ for just a pirate catcher - you\'ll note the design
requirements called for a ship that could support fleet actions as well.
Meson weapons get used in fleet actions, so I thought meson screens would
be appropriate.

  John Macpherson pointed out that he thought that the only meson weapons
would be big meson weapons.  That may well be true in his view of the
Traveller universe, but I would call your attention to the weapons table
in QSDS.  It includes a bay-mounted meson weapon.  I\'ll admit its not a
great weapon, and I\'m not sure why anyone would buy it, but it exists, and
it exists in such quantities in the Imperium that you get a 25% discount
for buying it!  To my mind, that is an indication that small meson weapons
are common in M0. After all, they are a great way of dealing with TL11 and
lower designs that use lots of armor to make themselves tough - meson
weapons just go in for a ship\'s guts and bypass the surface armor.  

  I would also point out that low level meson screens (5points or less on
under 1000T ships) are cheap, both in monetary terms and in power, crew,
and surface area terms.  I see them as cheap insurance, and while they may
be more expensive than adding additional structure to resist meson hits (I
don\'t do SSDS, so I don\'t know), they are the only way to make QSDS
designs more resistant to meson weapons.  While I agree that meson screens
might not have great utility, they are not expensive, and when you need
them you\'ll be damn glad you have them.  Probably adds to crew morale as
well, now that I think about it.

  John also commented about fighters and that they would not be much used
in a shipboard support role.  I have no desire to re-hash the fighter
debate that took up so much space on this mailing list recently, but
please re-read what I said.  Cleon I and the Imperial Navy in M0 like
fighters due to Fusion+, the background material talks about fighters, and
so I thought M0 designs should take that into account.  

  As for the nuclear damper vs sandcaster arguement, I thank John for
sharing his wisdom in that matter.  The only think I don\'t buy fully is
the idea of a Kinetic Kill Missile - I just have a hard time seeing how
that would work at Traveller ranges and speeds.  However, I do think his
arguements work as far as sandcasters vs. dampers, though I\'d like to hear
from other folks on this question, especially as far as how the existing
T4 space combat system works.

  As for crew space, well, that\'s just a personal preference.  I think
crews in larger quarters would be happier on long patrols.  Bunks do save
space, though, and they are tempting from a design point of view.

  Finally, I seem to have offended Roderick in my evaluation of his
Bludgeon design.  I\'m sorry if I seemed harsh - that was more due to the
fact that the ship met so few of the design criteria.  I did not mean to
imply it was not a capable warship - far from it.  I\'m sure it could kick
ass in a straight-up fight.  I also agree that the particle weapon makes a
good deal of sense as well, though in this design it seem to crowd out
lots of other stuff (as does the M6 drive).  I just don\'t think it fits
the mission given, and I rated it accordingly. 

  Great discussion - keep it up, folks!

Me! Me! Me!
Well, hi!
Hiw do I start this? How about this: I am a 22 yrs old male: My
nationality: German, although I think of myself as a European 
(Union,NOW). After finishing the German Equivalent ? of High School 
(Gymnasium) a couple of years ago, I first completed my year of 
military service in the German Airforce, the first three month in 
basic training, the latter 9 months getting pilots drunk in Goose 
Bay, Canada.
Right no I am in my 4th semester of Law in Trier University, the 
place that gave me Internet access (thankyouthankyouthankyou).
But this probably interests nobody, so let\'s cut to the more 
interesting bits:
My first knowledge of Traveller stems from a small german pocket book 
about various RPG\'s, describing and testing them. In there they also 
had a small caption on Traveller. Being a SciFi-Fan for some time, 
this was to me a must-have! So I wentout and bought the German 
version of CT. And liked it. Lots! Didn\'t play much, however.
So when I heard from a friend that MT was out 1 1/2 yeares later, 
that had to be bought too. And that we played, not as much as i would 
have liked, but still sometimes (it\'s harder to find gamers for 
Fantasy Rpg than for SciFi :-( ) When I moved away from my hometown 
in Northeren Germany to the Netherlands (AFCENT, Brunssum to be 
precise). I didn\'t get to play Trav very much. One time, I recall! 
This non-playing, but much-reading period lasted for the last 5 years 
now, but at the moment i am trying to form a new group. But even when 
not playing Tx,i still love to delve into it\'s rich background and 
collect everything i can get my hands on, for reading it is always a 
good substitute for playing it. Sometimes i stare at the SM-Map for 
hours imagining the possible adventures (sick, ey?).
At the moment, though, my Traveller activity is increasing, soon play 
will begin (MT) and finally, finally Traveller will be USED by 
me again!
If you want to know more about me, why not check out my homepage (and 
drive up my access counter), with the adress below! Also included are 
my Traveller projects, mostly my Ancients project, for which I can 
always need additional information about official or new sites not 
included in the listing!

A-That\'s all, folks!

time.  When designing small ships (or large ships for that matter), what
are the benifits and drawbacks of sandcasters vs. dampers?  Are dampers
only appropriate for larger ships where massed batteries are used, or are
small installations of three or four bays worthwhile, as compared to an
equal tonnage of sandcasters?

  I see the advantage of dampers as being their essentially unlimited
performance time in a long engagement - no cans to run out of, so as long
as the power plant is on they function.  Is this true?

  Please be sure to explain what combat system you are basing your
analysis on.  Also, please be sure to consider not just grand fleet
actions, but also ship to ship combat on a fairly equal scale.

"To send a message faster than the speed of light, you could build a

pulleys, each with a braking system connected by a belt, and one of the
pulleys has a motor.  When you start the motor, both pulleys will spin at
the same speed.  If you then apply the brake at one end, you will stop or
slow both ends at the same time.

If you place one end of the device near the earth and the other near a
distant place, such as Pluto, you could, by applying the brake on the earth
side, send a message (Morse Code style) to an observer on Pluto.  The
person on Pluto could send a response by applying his own brake, and the
whole converstation could take place in seconds instead of the hours that
it would take a radio message to travel this distance."  Tyler Burry,

  Well, I\'m both a gearhead and a squishhead - actually I\'m a former
gearhead who studies the interaction of gearheads and squishheads.  My
undergraduate background is a BS in Mechanical Engineering and Materials
Science and a BA in History from Rice University in Houston, Texas in
1984.  I got interested in the History of Technology while at Rice, and
went on to do my MA at the University of Houston (including two years
at the NASA history office at Johnson Space Center) and my PhD at the
University of Delaware in that subject.  After finishing my degree work in
1992, I had a variety of short term positions, including a stint last year
teaching at Iowa State University.  Since last September, I\'ve been in a
tenure track position at Oregon Institute of Technology, teaching history
and developing a new minor program in Technology, Society, and Values.
I\'m currently in Denmark on a six-month Fulbright Fellowship, teaching and
doing research at the University of Aarhus.

  My specialty is in the modern period (roughly 1800 to the present) of
industrial development, with particular interests in the history of the
engineering profession, the interaction between technology and popular
culture, and comparitive industrialization (differences between the
American, European, and Asian experience).  My doctoral dissertation was a
history of the magnetic recording industry, and most of my publications
to date have been in that field.  I have a book coming out later this year
that\'s a history of the American Association of Textile Chemists and
Colorists, a professional group I did contract work for, and I am
currently editing a collection of papers for the IEEE Press on the history
of Magnetic Recording that will be coming out next year for the 100th
anniversary of the first working magnetic recorder (Valdemar Poulsen,
Denmark, 1898).

  I\'ve been roleplaying since 1975 - D&D of course - and got into it
through wargames.  I discovered Traveller in 1979, and have been an avid
collector ever since - I own way too much Traveller stuff.  I gave up
board games in the late 1980s and sold off my collection (300+ games), but
I still roleplay actively.  I like a variety of other SF games, like
2300AD, Shadowrun, Cyberpunk 2020, and Macho Women with Guns, but my
favorite of all time is Space 1889, with Traveller and Call of Cthulhu
close behind. 

  Oh, and I just turned 36 this weekend, married for 5 years (no kids yet) 
to my best friend Anne, the geologist in my life.  In addition of RPGs, I
also like to restore cars - I have a 1963 Triumph TR-4 sportscar at the
moment - and read history, esp. about 19th C. colonialism.  I used to read
lots of science fiction, but I find so much of it so poorly written (in
terms of literary style) these days I tend to stick more to classic
literature for fun reading.  I also like to brew and drink beer - my one
great vice.

  Interesting to see the wide variety of backgrounds of folks on the list
- - next please!

Look around. The birth rate of the western world is declining. Ireland is
just about the only country in the EC where more people are born than die.
What you are postulating is just simple projection from where we are.

I had a society in my game background where children were born and raised
by the state. Didn\'t need genetic doners as they state already had your
gene set from your birth. Imagine the civil service being the parent to the
entire world. Scary. Ends up sort of like Paranoia taken seriously.

>Another high tech issue is unwanted pregnancy.
Again, the decline in birth rate in the West can be seen to lead directly
from women\'s control over their own fertility.
However, for another plot hook, turn this on its head. If you have a state
where you do have perfect control over fertility, but don\'t have external
gestation, you will, modeling after the modern west, have a decline of
birth rate. This is not good economically, culturaly and it means less tax
comes in to the government. The backlash is to legislate that women _must_
have children. Almost _all_ pregnancies will be unwanted and the state will
_have_ to raise them since you can\'t expect that someone who _has_ to will
do a "quality job".
Push it further and allow "liberalisation" whereby a woman who has had more
than her required quota can forgo the state bonus and _sell_ her child to
another woman who does not wish to do so.
Turn it around again: what about men? The legislation could be that
_everyone_ must account for one child. The initial position might be that a
child counts half for the father and half for the mother. However if this
is done genetically it encourages rape (but possibly countered by perfect
abortion) or, at best, forced semination. Reversing it, if it is done by
the mother\'s consent (since no one can argue _her_ parentage :-) then _all_
women can sell off the rights to their children. Since, once a woman has
paid _her_ social debt, she is unlikely to want another, this might drive
up the market price. Folowing on, if there is a high market price for
newborn allocation then you can bet the cost of pre-natal care will also be
driven artifically high, etc, etc.
It could make for some _interesting_ cargo runs :-).

>can you imagine what the implications would be if we controlled babies
>perfectly?  Lots of blue eyes, ..
Again, project. There are a lot of, roughtly, 30 year old women right now
with the name Michele. Why? Well, I believe a certain song was released by
a popular band...
Taking it further, if there was perfect control over the results, you would
see waves of fashion in children. This would be very convoluted. Since
whatever proved to be the most desired choice when a child was concieved
would, inevitably, end up being _common_ and not _fashionable_ since we\'re
talking years and years on. So the drive would be to do something uncommon,
unique, and hope that enough people don\'t select it that it ends up to have
been the fashionable choice and not a groutesque.

My head is spinning...

As you can see, except at the shortest turn lengths, the distance
you\'ll cover is a lot more important than your velocity. And the
scales are ridiculously *small* until the turn length gets up there a
ways. CT used 10 minutes and 1000 miles (1600 km).

You *have* to reduce the hex size in step with the turn length, just to

Which is exactly how such combat *would* work. You fire at where you
*think* the guy will be, because you are working from data a noticeable
fraction of a turn old.

But at those ranges and velocities, you\'ll either have to come to a
stop relative to each other, or else they can just zip past and refuse
to engage, by staying out of range.

Interesting data point. The Chinese use *oak* heat shields on re-entry
vehicles. Works quite well, as long as you are careful about things
like knots. It ablates much like the hi-tech stuff we used on the old
space capsules. 

There\'s not enough oygen for it to burn (nor any easy way for oxygen to
pentrate the surface), so it chars. Then the charcoal burns off and the
ash flakes away, exposing more charcoal and wood. If it\'s still
smoldering once you get subsonic, you can jettison it.

Aircraft plywood is good stuff too. Ditto for fiberglass. And there is
even TL0 "fiberglass". The Byzantine Empire made light armor out of
layers of linen glued together with the weave at angles. Remember, this
is stuff along the lines of horn/hoof-derived glue, which is a lot like
lowgrade plastic when set. I suspect that you could make an airtight
spacesuit using something like this for the parts that don\'t have to bend.
(with enough creativity, it\'s possible to build a usable pressure suit
with no flexing joints, only rotating ones)

Well, at least in Terran species, there\'s a fair amount of evidence
that about the same percentage of the members of *all* higher species
(mammals and birds) are "homosexual". That is, they prefer the sex role
that doesn\'t match their anatomy. Any farmer can tell you stories about
various farm animals...

So let\'s assume that much the same applies to Aslan, Vargr, and K\'kree
(and any minor races). Hiver "sex" is of interest only to bioligists,
so we can ignore them. Ditto for races with similar (lack) of sexual
roles. 

So, I\'d expect that either the culture accepts these sort of members,
or it doesn\'t. If they don\'t accept it, they are likely to not be
really thrilled about members of *other* species that don\'t fit the
"proper" role. That is, if the alien race dislikes homosexuality, they
will want members of other races to at least *act* as if they are
following the proper gender roles. 

I\'d say that the K\'kree are pretty intolerant. So, they\'d expect even
*alien* males to act like K\'kree males, and the females to act like
K\'kree females. This fits pretty well with the K\'kree "tendency" to
treat social goals as superior to biology (We don\'t care *what* your
species evolved to eat, you\'ll eat plants and *like it!)

Aslan seem more reasonable. So you might occasionally find a female
warrior or male administrator. But given the "strictness" of gender
roles in their society, they might do like certain Terran cultures that
accepted people who were "different", but had fairly strict gender
roles (Native Americans, for one). So the male Aslan administrator
would not only be dressed as a female and treated like one, he\'d be
doing his best to blend in. Female Aslan as warriors is rather less
likely, depending on just *how* different male and female strength and
size are.

Vargr, being descended from pack animals aren\'t likely to have as much
in the way of gender-specific roles. They could still have the
alpha/beta male and alpha/beta female bit, but more likely they kept
the alpha/beta part, but only treat females differently when they get
pregnant. (Anybody know if Vargr still go into heat, or if they are
"always in heat" like us primates?). Heck, if you go this way with
Vargr, I\'d expect that they\'d only care about the *sex* (as opposed to
"status") of a partner if they wanted kids rather than recreation.
But *boy* will they care about status!

It was actually steel, or at least iron. Wood is a bitch to work with
for anything that big. There was mention of a race that had spacetravel
and used *bronze* spacecraft because they\'d never discovered iron
working before someone else conquered tham.

There was also the key bit that the "simple" experiment that led to
antigrav, also led to FTL, and antigrav detectors, but no other useful
technologies. And they distract folks from the paths that lead to
electricity. Advanced chemistry tends to get overlooked too.

Author is Harry Turtledove. 

There were only two stories. The one with the "first contact", and one
after we\'d expanded explosively into space, conquering everything in
site, and then had our ramshackle empire fall apart. The hero discovers
another *technological* race that is just starting on the expansion
period. And since humanity and a few allies are only just beginning to
put things back together...

A good paint will help *enormously* with regards to the temp
variations. White will keep you from absorbing too much heat, and it\'ll
slow down heat *loss* on the dark side. You want a reasonably constant
temp inside, so you aren\'t going to let the hull temp swing any more
than you can avoid. The paint also helps confine volatiles. 

Also, mere vacuum doesn\'t remove the volatiles at a huge rate. The
chinese use *oak* heatshields! I\'d say that once it\'s been properly
cured, you won\'t lose more volatiles expect at a slow rate.

Considering that the only difference is that Mayday uses hexes and the
others listed just use "inches", I\'m not so sure about "much easier". 

Either way, I\'m *strongly* in favor of vectored movement. It\'s *not*
that hard to do, and helps remind folks that this ain\'t Star Wars or
Star Trek.

Vectored movement shouldn\'t be a large problem with any decent combat
system. Though "hidden movement" at longer ranges would help.

I only recall one other. the story of the first contact. And to confuse
things, it was published in analog *after* "The Road Less Travelled",

Don\'t forget that you can make thermionic devices (tubes) the size of a
*dime*. They did that back when it looked like tubes were the only way
to guarantee immunity to EMP. So you get devices that are *3d* layouts
of metal, ceramic and vacuum in a "solid" block. No filaments, you just
coat the cathodes with something to increase thermal electron
emissions, and heat the whole thing to dull red heat. 

So you get computers that are large, but not overly so. An XT might be
the size of a couple of suitcases. But the insulation and heating
system adds a bit... I rather expect to find that large chunks of the
control systems for fusion reactors are built this way. They\'ll be
fairly immune to the large particle fluxes and the heat and magnetic
fields.

The "minimum" info needed for an accurate orbit (acurate enough for
shipping purposes) is this 7 pieces of data, in one of two formats
(they are interconvertible, and I someday hope to have the equations
for doing the conversion!)

A: cartesian
	1-3. x, y, & z position "vectors"
	4-6. x, y, & z velocity vectors
	7. time hack for the above 6 items

B: Orbital
	1. semi-major axis of orbit (how big is it)
	2. Eccentricity of orbit (what shape is it)
	3. inclination of orbit           \\
	4. longitude of the ascending node > (what plane is it in)
	5. argument of the perihelion (how is it oriented in that plane)
	6. ???
	7. time of perihelion passage (where in the orbit is it)

There are corrections needed because there\'s more than just the star
and the planet. But corrections of the sort the ships will need aren\'t
*that* complex. 

Going by current practice, each sector or subsector will have an
ephemeris published for it annually. You buy it for a few credits (say
20-50) and plug it into the astrogation systems. It has the corrections
that are useful for the year it was printed to cover. You can sort of
kludge around having an old one, but that\'s a *really* stupid thing to
do. The IISS (or equivalent organization in other jurisdictions) has
surveyed the systems well enough (or gotten astronomical data good
enough) from the natives so that they can produce data that\'ll let you
get positions accurate to a meter or so up to 10 years in advance. But
they only release a given years data 6 months in advance "just in
case". 

For areas that don\'t have a widespread government or that are "wild",
you can attempt to project old data ahead (positions will be close
enough to get from jump exit to the planet unless you are low on fuel),
or you can check at the port before you leave for the latest data they
have (see below) or you can try to use ship\'s sensors yourself.

From the old Alien modules, it\'s clear that a ship can detect *some* if
not all of the stars within 3 parsecs, as the "unknown space" rules
printed in several of them, allow discovering stars 3 parsecs away.

In module 4 (Vargr), they go into a bit more detail, even though it
disagrees with the unknown space rules (which are identical in all the
modules they appear in). In modelue 4 they state that modern starships
can detect worlds at a distance of up to 2 parsecs. It takes about a
day. This includes detecting gas giants.

It goes on to state that any type A port can provide data on any world
within 5 parsecs, any type B can provide data on worlds within 3
parsecs. And this is *good* data. So I\'d say that for areas that don\'t
have an "empire" doing the charting, each A or B port has data as noted
above. That plus the "sector maps" should allow you to get around
without *too* much trouble.

  Okay, but I seem to recall that sandcasters can be used to target

as giant shotguns (in one version) or as blocking the damage (if missiles

actually just a discussion of possible combat systems?

That might only be a problem at the lowest social levels
(though if that\'s the level you\'re in, it IS a problem).
More likely the effect will be felt as a reduced pool
of skilled workers in "female" areas -- like technical fields.

Two probable remedies:
1) ally with a biologically Aslan clan, trading technical
and business expertise for military strength (extra sons
means extra troops);
2) contract with aslan corporations to provide a number
of services that Clans would normaly take care of in-house.

Most likely is a combination of the two.

Who needs genetics? Just abort "excess" males.
However, that sort of thing doesn\'t seem to 
happen, or ihatei problems would be a bit smaller.
Personally, I wouldn\'t have them "fix" the ratio
because it\'s much more interesting making them adapt.

>Wow.  Never thought of this one.

In the GDW-Beta discussion, the suggestion came up
that some human males might opt to become "socially
female," i.e., a biologically human male decides
(very early on) to be treated in all ways as a 
female, something akin to becoming a monk or a
enuch in the Chinese Imperial Court -- they might
consider what they get to be worth more than what
they give up. (It would help explain Aslans\' slowness
to pick up on outsider humans\' visual cues about
what sex they are -- the last broad-shouldered,
flat-chested, full-bearded human they met had been
an inventory accountant for Clan Manysyllables,
obviously a female).

On the other hand, the Aslan might consider that
to be a form of deception, thus dishonorable,
thus they don\'t allow it.

You are, of course referring to Herr Doktor Viktor von Doom,
Monarch of Latveria (somewhere[fictional] in the northern Balkans,
probably near Austria), who\'s supposed to be ethnically
Gypsy. Kinda your whole argument in a nutshell (an armored,
booby-trapped, robot-doubled nutshell, though :)


I think it\'s a legacy of the combination of Mary Shelly\'s
Frankenstein (both the original novel and the Lon Chaney
film, in some different ways for each), the fact that
a number of early "world famous scientists" -- from Einstein
to von Braun -- spoke english with heavy German accents
(for obvious reasons), and American xenophobia: that
particular stereotype was established in the period after
WWI, when anti-German bias was rather strong due to
both the war and immigrants.

Or using fission in a controlled manner as a fission drive or using fusion
in a controlled manner as a fusion drive. Fission and fusion bombs use
these reactions to release the fuels energy rapidly instead of slowly as in
drives.
Also, why not looking at the nuke missiles with neutron detectors etc? And
sweep them with those handy dandy nuclear dampers? My greatest objection to
space missiles being pumped X-ray is canon. On the one hand canon says most
civilian ships have missiles yet the Imperium is extremely stingy on the
use and ownership of nukes as in the Imperial Rules of war. It might be OK
for those playing mostly naval battles in Traveller but the civilian trader
(OK, smuggler is a better word) cannot possibly be allowed to own nukes or
is there an equivalent of National Rifle Association in the future pushing
for private nukes?

 In the future capacitance switches will be used instead as a grace to
nonconductive alien fingers. They\'re a bit expensive today but just wait a
couple of thousand years and they might come up with cheaper ways of making
them.

Squids have copper instead of iron for oxygen transportation in their

Yes we do have pulp Sci-Fi creatures living in our oceans and they\'re

I was born in Skye in the west of Scotland in 1962 - and to anyone who   
asks I\'m 25 years old (except the mornings after I\'ve been drinking with   
my father, when I\'m slightly in excess of three million years old). ;-)

I began wargaming at school in 1975 and roleplaying in 1976 when I   
discovered a brown boxed set of D&D in amongst the wargames rules at my   
local hobby shop. I picked up one of the first copies of Traveller into   
the UK in 1978 (I know because I watched them unpack the box).

I joined the Fleet Air Arm (Royal Navy) in 1978 - well, I actually only   
went into the recruiting centre to shelter from the rain - and served   
nine years as a weapons electrical mechanician working on Lynx   
helicopters.

Between 1979 and 1986, I also ran Traveller tournaments and events for   
Games Workshop, in the days when they were worth working for. In   
addition, I helped out on a couple of issues of White Dwarf and some   
proofreading of the Traveller stuff printed by GW. My association with GW   
ended when Steve and Ian sold up.

I\'m not ashamed (these pills are wonderful!) to say that I was a member   
of the ill-fated GDW International Demo Team in the early nineties, for   
which I got an odd-coloured polo shirt which now lines the cat basket.   
Fortunately I didn\'t get roped into demonstrating Mythos.

I\'m not going to list the RPGs, boardgames and wargames I have owned or   
run. Suffice to say, I keep selling the buggers and I still can\'t get   
into my study for games! I have a soft spot in my heart for Traveller   
(even MT, which I hated with a passion until someone gave me the errata).

These days I am a technical author for a human resources software house.   
In my spare time (ha!), I write freelance stuff for the hobby - including   
some material for Mileu 0, although IG cut all my work about the Vargr   
and Cleon\'s emancipation of the Vargr slaves (it made for good background   
and adventure stuff, but it was a bit contentious - maybe it\'ll see print   
in the alien book, but I\'m not holding my breath). I am also the SF   
editor for Valkyrie magazine (a UK Independent RPG mag). In addition to   
all of that, I am writing a book about the British invasion of Tibet in   
1903/04 (British colonial history being a fascination of mine). Finally,   
I\'m trying hard to re-learn my Mother\'s language, Gaelic, having   
forgotten all I ever knew as a child.

At the moment I\'m trying to find time to rework the Traveller Adventure   
to run in Aslan space [thanks to the two guys who emailed me Traveller   
word generators, the task will be a bit easier]. My group are currently   
in the final stages of another Aslan-based campaign based loosely on the   
story of Beren and Luthien from the Silmarillion. If there\'s any   
interest, I\'ll post a short write-up when the campaign ends.

I\'ll leave the stats for another day.

	No no no!  I am not offended!  As I\'ve repeatedly pointed out, I
bozed up in not reading the mission criteria, and I believe that it fully
deserved harsh evaluation.  It\'s just that I disagreed on your take on the
need for dampers and meson screens (I probably would have left them out
even had I gone a more reasonable route), and felt that you\'d
underestimated the combat effectiveness of putting the biggest PA gun and
five of the biggest lasers available at TL-12 into a 700 td hull.  Like
someone pointed out in email I was thinking more in terms of a pocket
destroyer than a patrol craft :).

	And I agree that the discussion is great...  I think that we\'re
thoroughly testing the ship design systems here.

	Onto another tangent, I\'m starting to think that we ought to
seriously consider KKM weapons.  I came up with this idea last night for a
KKM anti-missile PD system involving a battery of 50 or so 1mm VRF Gauss
weapons with 5-meter barrels and a huge ammo dump crammed into a large
turret.  The applications and implications are pretty obvious, and in a
head-on ship-to-ship pass, it\'d probably be incredibly effective against
ships as well.  IMHO, whatever ship combat system Ken bashes together
really ought to address the issue of KKM\'s; if it doesn\'t it\'s going to
have a huge credibility problem (in fact any system that doesn\'t does too
IMHO).

	Back to the grind!

	Yeah, I read an article in Discover a couple years back where a 
scientist had discovered microtubules in the brain, each of which 
contained a single electron. He argued that the tubules propogated the 
wave motion of the electron when it decided to be a wave, and this was 
somehow related to our ability to have concious thought. If a species 
was built on the basis of this sort of tubule nervous system, where the 
propogated waves were the nerve impulses (perhaps several small tubules 
acting in series or something, I don\'t know how fast it\'d be). Of 
course, that would require definition and control of how electrons 
decide to be particles/waves/wartcles/etc., a subject somewhat out of my 
league.

	That was definitely the case during WWI and WWII, where most of the 
individuals were draftees, and submarines were just becoming practical for 
long-distance patrols and such. The crews HAD to be there; they didn\'t have much 
choice with the draft. SAme with Korea and Vietnam. Current shipbuilding doctrine is 
moving to more comfortable crew accomodations; not Airport Hilton, but definitely 
better than hot-bunking. Granted, mosts ships in today\'s navy are cramped 
quarters-wise, but this is probably due to the fact that the majority of them (at 
least the ones I read about in Tom Clancy\'s _Marine_) are over 20 years old. The new 
LPD-17, for instance, will be significantly roomier. I agree with what someone else 
said: crew accomodations have an effect on morale, and morale directly affects 
efficency. This (probably) wouldn\'t matter for patrols of only a few days, but 
definitely would for any ship that stayed out for, oh, a week or more.

I think sandcasters were mentioned as giant shotguns in Striker 2:1:st
edition but never in space combat as far as I can tell but I\'ve been known
to be wrong before :)

    'body' => 'First, a comment on sandcasters vs. nuclear dampers:

	IMHO, dampers are useless against anything but missles, while 
sandcasters can defend against the major space combat weapon: lasers 
(including detonation ones). This makes nuke dampers more of a special 
case defense weapon, kinda like meson screens, only with alternate 
defense strategies available.
	I feel that nuke dampers would become relatively inefficent 
compared to true PD systems (like the 7-gun turret in Joe\'s archives), 
as they can\'t engage multiple targets, and don\'t have any range to speak 
of. Even if aforementioned 7-gun turret had a damage USP of ?/1-0-0-0, 
it would still be able to knock down missle reliably at long enough 
ranges to make det-lasers useless.
	One idea, though: if a small nuke detonated in the vicinity of a 
ship (say BL range 0), even if it didn\'t damage the ship, would it still 
cause a sensor white-out (ala BL)? If so, you could sneak a couple of 
small missles (using IR guidance or something that wouldn\'t have been 
blinded, say, turned on by remote) through, as the PD systems would be 
unable to detect them until it\'s too late.
	Has anyone played around with 3G3? I loved the design rules in 
FF&S, and was wondering if the 3G3 rules were as good for personal 
weapons. Any comments? How about design rules for starship weapons? Is a 
new FF&S style book coming out for T4?
	One question for TNE: a bad guy in Battle Dress (AV 13) gets 
fired on by a couple PCs.
	1. Does he suffer any blunt trauma from the non-penetrating 
bullets? The rules seem to indicate he would, but it seems 
counter-intuitive...
	2. He gets hit with a 2.5cm HEAT grenade. The die is rolled, 
yielding a final PV of, say, 28 (base 25 + 3 on the roll). 28-13 is 15. 
How much damage does the wearer take? 15 points? 15d6? I know this would 
damage a comparably armored vehicle, but no rules for this sort of 
situation were given...
	I just joined the list a few days ago, so forgive my easily 
answered question: what is THUDD? I know it\'s a design contest of some 
sort, but that\'s about it. Is there an archive I can read back digests 
of TML at? 
	One more thing (for now...): could anyone tell me how to 
subscribe to the GDW-beta list?

I recently was working at a Macaroni Grill here in Wichita that 
incorporated touch-screen computers as part of their order-taking 
system (kinda like a touch-screen register). The thing that intrigued me 
was that it would detect touches by a credit card (I used to use the 
corner of the card to punch in the number if it didn\'t swipe right). Was 
this a special kind of screen, one of those capacitance switches, or 
something else entirely?

If I\'m correct, there\'s a type of crab (horseshoe?) that has kinda creamy
blue blood that uses copper instead of iron to carry oxygen.

I also saw in the paper (??) a small frog that has it\'s chromosomes
on quartets instead of pairs like everything else...

They move nothing like Empire Strikes back.  First, you\'d be lucky
to be able to see another asteroid if you were standing on one (very
lucky, actually).
 
They move in various orbits, although they would probably be a
little eccentric.  Since the reason for objects in a solar system
orbiting in the same direction is conservation of angular momentum,
things tend to rotate in a plane.  There will be exceptions, but
this is the probable layout.  As a result, you could move out of
plane and avoid the "dense" part of an asteroid belt without dodging
around (see other comments about density of asteriod belts :-)

I missed this somehow the first time around, though I do remember it coming

recently... and wished I had still missed it.  Ick.  Of course YMMV.  

OTOH, "Ghost in the Shell" might be sort of anime-Traveller-esque, if you

 But what will happen when we misjump a parsec? Will the time uncertainty

Well, I\'m only an armchair astronomer, but I can tell you that the
movements of the asteroid field was the *smallest* problem. The big
problem was the proximity and quantity of asteroids.

Asteroids are *much* farther apart, and therefore the concentration (at
least in our belt) is *much* lower. A belt like that one wouldn\'t last
very long; the asteroids would smash into each other until all that was
left was a few big ones and space dust. Hmmmmm... Maybe it was a fresh
field... the Death Star might have been taking some target practice in
the Hoth system. :-)

By the way, if the asteroids relative positions of asteroids moving in
concentric orbits are not stable and fixed, as the asteroids in inner
orbits are moving faster than asteroids in outer orbits. Also, iirc,
asteroid orbits tend to have differing ellipticity, so their orbits
frequently cross each other.

The unrealistic asteroid field didn\'t stop me from enjoying the scene
where an asteroid hits the bridge of a Star Destroyer, and then cuts to
Darth Vader\'s holovid conference where a certain Destroyer Captain puts
his arms in the air as his image flickers out. . .

Yep. I miscalculated. I may also have over-calculated gunners - for
turrets grouped into batteries, I assigned one gunner per turret,
as well as one gunner for the MFD, which is how I read SSDS. The turret
gunners live in the turrets (surprise!), the MFD gunners co-ordinate
the action of the turrets, forming batteries from the bridge.

The lasers should have read 
4x Heavy Laser (+5) 1/2-2-1-0
4x Light Laser (+5) 1/2-1-1-0

which still isn\'t so great, but there\'s lot of lasers, even if they\'re
not so so strong. According to the T4 space combat system (broken as it may
be) this should be just as effective, if not more so, than one big laser.

Besides, one could always re-organize the batteries (there\'s a total of
8 heavy turrets and 12 light turrets).

Well, I designed a 4G and a 2G version, but I submitted this one
because it was more heavily armed. drop the weapons to 3x each and
it\'ll do 4G with all crew in G-tanks. I don\'t think meson screens are
that big a deal for most of the actions this ship will be involved in
and again, 10A 4P 10J (??) is the best you can get in SSDS.

As for bunks, well, OK. But hey, it\'s the Navy, not Tukera Lines.

     I haven\'t been following the other Gays thread but I can guess its
contents.
     Anyway, Pocket Empires largely concerns families, marriages, children
and how you can use them to run create empires out in the outback of the
Imperium. The following paragraph (or something like it) was edited from
the final version:

     With the barriers to fertility removed by technology there is nothing
preventing marriages between two people of the same gender or even
different species. Similarly some families may not have marriage at all but
propagate through autogenisis or cloning. What they gain in solidarity they
lose in potential trade agreements. In such cases the referee will have to
use their discression in determining children\'s genetic dice.

     I removed it, myself, before final submission for two main reasons:
1) The section didn\'t lose much from having it removed. Certainly not
enough to warrant the uneducated criticisim it might engender from
Concerned Parents Against Everything.
2) Anyone with half a brain could work that out anyway.
     Fair enough?

     Now the section on arranged marriages and divorce, _that_ generated
quite a bit of internal discussion... Ask me sometime in the pub...

In a real asteroid field, you are unlikely to be able to see one rock from
another without a good telescope and someone telling you where to look.
(Small asteroid "moons" like Ida\'s excepted).  So, yes, that and most
artistic portrayals of asteroid belts (like the cover of 2300\'s Nyotekundu
sourcebook, aaaargh) as chock-ful of tumbling and colliding chunks of rock
acting like a celestial Cuisinart to any ships so foolish as to enter...

...are entirely fictional and unrealistic, though they sure look exciting.

A suggestion to prevent the "sameness" that prevails when all characters have
a Pilot-1/Medic-3/Gunner-2/what-have-you: When the PC gets the skill, have
them roll a d3 <g> to determine the exact number of "experience levels" they
receive and record that rather than giving 3 "el\'s" per skill level. This would
give more character variety as well as end the unrealistic  assumption that 
character A and B both learn the exact same amount of information about
Engineering during their one-year course.

Of course, it also reintroduces the d3 into a system determined to be rid of it!
Entropy and chaos, boys, ya can\'t fight it! <g>

My favorite has always been a contact lens that goes in the eye and acts as
a monitor/HUD. For the more hardcore inclined, it can be implanted into the
eye as an artificial lens. The material of the lens/implant is made of a LED/
LCD-ish material that is controlled by a short distance transmitter of some 
sort, possibly built within the earring that has the speaker. The more expensive
models are "one-way" and no one can see the light and colors/patterns they 
produce but you, while many of the standard models give your eyes a 
glittering, lighted, color-shifting appearance on close observation, leading
to the slang term "kaleidoscope eyes".

What hole? We\'re discussing an opening into another dimension within
the ship that doesn\'t interact with the jump space dimension at all. Two
seperate dimensions, no overlap, no contact, no holes in the jump space
barrier. And just like the jump dimension needs a jump field to be produced to
act as a barrier between it and our dimension, the "heat sink" dimension 
requires heat input to act as a barrier between it and us.

This makes no sense at all. He stated that a dimension has been found that
allows you to dump heat. If you add in a dimension that we can suck 
heat out of, you are no longer within the terms of his game world, and 
are not exhibiting the "internal coherence" that has been written in stone

Yes it has, he just stated that such a dimension exists/has been found. 
Please keep the real world and the game world example seperate please.

Good lord, no. Your typical movie asteroid field bears no resemblence
whatsoever to the Real World (tm.) 

Asteroids aren\'t on perfectly concentric orbits, so they do collide...
but not very often. The reason for that is that our asteroid belt is
incredibly less dense than anything every shown in a movie - there are a few
thousand big asteroids spread over a few trillion cubic kilometers. 
You could travel through the asteroid belt for a million years without ever
getting close enough to one to see it as anything more than a dot of light.

I never had a problem with this idea.  If the enemy fleet tries to
move around the opponents\'s "battle line" to get at his "reserve", the
"battle line" only has to move a short distance (compared to the enemy
fleet) to place itself between the "reserve" and the enemy once again.
If your enemy decides to split up into multiple task forces, you can
always do the same (producing multiple "battle lines").  And it is
kinda cool :)

If you\'ve deployed inflatable decoys and cooled to 4K, you\'ve stopped
evading. If you\'ve stopped evading, lasers can\'t miss you, even at 
100,000km+ ranges. At slow closing velocities this gives the point
defence weapons several minutes to engage the missile and decoy swarm,
which lets a good point defence laser (I\'ve designed them with FFS) 
destroy up to 2000 decoys or so. If a missile can carry (generously)
100 decoys, a PD laser turret can destroy 20 such missiles. Since each 
6-ton missile barbette can only hold 5 missiles, it\'s not had to see that
the PD laser wins.

This is admittedly a traveller flaw - even the reaction drives are
way too efficient, let alone thrusters, so KKMs get much more energy than
they should.

I hope this isn\'t a official scientific publication... Anyway, to my
knowledge this won\'t work since if you look closely at the "stick"
between the two machines, like on the molecular level. You will see that
the first molecule moves, then at the speed of light the rest of the
molecules line up with that first one. It\'s not a very good explanation,
though I hope you understand what I mean.

Might be fun... :)
