Yes William, I know.  ;-> I\'d just much prefer not switching back and
forth between the two terms from step to step in a desgin process like
was done in FFS.  

My understanding is that standard deckplans will be 2\'x2\'x3.5\' for T4. 
So each hex/square will be 1 displacement ton.  Folks that are
designing standard sized containers, fixtures, etc might want to keep
that in mind.

Hi Pierre,

Looks like a workable system.  What do you use for the values?  Are they 
derived by averaging the survival, commission, and promotion target numbers?

Right.  The way character generation is presented in CT, generating a 
character becomes a solo game in itself.

True.

Hmmm. An interesting idea. It would certainly be playable.

This is an interesting idea, and it wouldn\'t require very much 
modification to the advanced character generation systems.  Just pick the 
duty assignment (or, make two tables - one of the less-lethal assignments 
like garrison, the other table having only risky assignments), then use 
the same tables.  It may prove necessary to change some of the skills and 
skill tables, though.

True.  But, I haven\'t run into too many players of any RPG (other than 
experienced players of Paranoia) who don\'t treasure their characters. :)

I know nothing other than the TNE system (minor MT experience).  But it
would seem to me that the easiest way to go about thing would be to
pre-determine the number of terms one\'s character will serve.  Course that
would eliminate traveller as a system where it can actually be FUN to play
geezers.  nyuk.

Well, knee-jerk would be that the Regency would steam roll the RC.  But
then one must consider what the assimilation of a culture as tenacious as
the RC would do to the Imperium.  Is there enough memory of the Imperium
in the RC that they would re-integrate with the latest extention of the
Imperium (I have limited RC knowledge)?  And then, of course, there\'s the
Hivers...

To a certain extent, yes...BUT (don\'t you hate that word?)...  Chances are
cargo carried in a yugowhateveritscalled would not be worth stealing
(that\'s the whole point of the ship, if I understand correctly).  Why
would the pirates knock of a garbage scow?  Chances are, it wouldn\'t even
be worth it to capture it and strip parts.  Also, in the spinward main, it
would work great for the short hops from well guarded system to well
guarded system.   Good enough system defence, and you don\'t need to worry
about pirates within _at least_ 100 diameters from the planet, and that\'s
all you need.

        Agh! NO! <brief interlude as I go hopping around my desk trying to
pull my hair out by the roots>.  Ok... now that I\'ve chilled out, Civil law
is not a catch-all category for legal systems that aren\'t common-law; it
refers to a very specific legal tradition descended from Roman law, with
some inputs from Germanic custom and other later European systems, that\'s
been studied in European universities since the 1300\'s, was throroughly
codified in Europe over the 19th century, and is now followed by much of the
planet; Continental Europe, parts of North America, Latin America, the PRC,
Taiwan, Japan, former French and German colonies worldwide all use civil
law.  Common law is used only in former British possessions.

        Saying that Islamic law is civilian is like saying that there\'s no
need to have a separate skill for cavalry dragoon and for FO :).  I\'d
suspect, not that I know anything much about it, that it is way different
from the civil law; things like the prohibition on interest, polygamy, and
ease of divorce are completely alien to the civil law tradition...

        That would make for an interesting adventure, and wopuld be a lot of
fun to research and prepare...  although planetary rotation would make
praying in the direction of Mecca an interesting affair.  The Faithful would
have to be very up on their celestial mechanics :).

        Could be.  The common law as such has its roots in the justice
dispensed by William the Conqueror\'s magistrates; given that numbers of
Norse settled in the British Isles, I imagine that their legal influence was
felt to some degree...  Glenn could probably answer this better than I can.

        Perfectly good nuke grenade?  Dude, you\'re scaring me.  I said
thermonuclear hand grenade as a joke; point being that the thrower would for
all intents and practical purposes be at Ground Zero just like the target.
I got the idea out of one of those Real Men/Real Roleplayers/Real
Loonies/Munchkin files out there... you know:

Real Men use Fusion Guns
Real Roleplayers use Flechette Guns
Real Loonies use Thermonuclear Hand Grenades
Munchkins use whatever gives the most plusses...

        *Readers* are available. But how many people out there won\'t want to

        Actually, I grew up in Europe. And kiloliters is a perfectly
legitimate metric unit ... the standard prefix "kilo-" for thousand, and
"-liter" for the volume of 1 kg of water at a specific temperature.

        Just because it\'s not commonly used doesn\'t mean it\'s not "real." I
have seen it used elsewhere beside DGP when referring to a large quantity of
liquid ... 10kl is easier to write than 10,000l. Likewise, you won\'t find
roadsigns marked in Mm (megameters - 1,000km or 1,000,000m), but it is used
where large distances are involved.

Course, if you watch Star Wars critically (don\'t get me wrong, its one of
the greatest flicks out there), it does come up a little short.  If you
watch it in french it gets even worse (Obi Wan says, for instance,
something akin to: "I found this sword.  I think it\'s your fathers.  You
can have it").

Also, the Regency kept it\'s advanced technology, unlike the RC.  While they
have been able to rebuild, they can\'t be at the same level (I ONLY have the
main TNE books, so correct me if wrong).

I was wondering what the RC\'s reaction to the Regency even existing would
be, I mean culturally.  If you think about it, the Regency embodies some of
the things the RC hates, like nobility (albeit in a limited form), and of
course, the spelling of \'humaniti\' :)  

And, as the quotes Derek used show, the Regency, at least, in the future
believes that the Star Viking methods were harsh, but perhaps necessary, so
maybe they lost to them.  Who knows?

   I\'m saying that TNE assumes *all* races were threatened by Virus, yet
logically this makes no sense. 

   To try to make this more clear, let\'s compare US and Russian computer
design. The American computers and Russian computers have *totally*
different form factors, and even less compatible architectural
differences. This is from two different societies on Earth at more-or-less
the same tech-level (Traveller scale). Can you imagine the difficulties
you would have trying to mate hardware designed by two different races at
two different tech-levels? Different form-factors, different
*assumptions*, different *engineering* - hell they may not have the same
views on LOGIC. Yet these differung systems are all vulnerable to the
*same* Virus? Get real...

  It\'s impossible to "design" a Virus that can infect *all* computers,
even if you assume that the computers not complex enough to support virus
aren\'t included in the definition.

  Architectures won\'t just change from race to race, they\'ll change from
tech-level to tech-level as new technologies come on line and make
different techniques possible. Varying architectures _insure_ that Virus
cannot run it\'s code on *all* machines. 

  If after reading this, you still don\'t get the point, then I challenge
you to write a Virus that can infect *both* my \'486 PC, running OS/2 and a
68x0x0 Mac, running Sys/7 - with*out* any differences in the Virus
between the two. Further, the process must be *invisible*, must not give
any clues to it\'s existence prior to infection, and is unremovable without
destroying the computer. (Another dumb stipulation by GDW)

   Sensors send/read DATA, period. No executable machine code is loaded
into the computer via sensors, if it were I wouldn\'t even bother building
Warships I\'d just use computer overrides to take control of enemy ships.

My first attempt at a QSD design, and only my third at ANY starship (I\'ve
done a CT design and a FFSLite design).  

The Bulk Freighter is somewhat similar to the Yugo transports suggested in
earlier posts.  However, I like the idea of a somewhat volitile Imperial
core, even in the best of times, so I have made this freighter armed with a
civilian battery, and some sandcasters.

Please give me your comments, and corrections, as, like I said this is my
first attempt at a QSD design.  Thanks.

The Bulk Freight Carrier is a monstrous beast of a ship.  It is meant for
long-haul large shipments, and it similar to the large supercarriers of late
20th century Terra.

The ship\'s crew complement of 15 is comprised of: 5 Engineers, 2
Electronics, 2 Manuver, 4 Gunners, 2 Command.  There is a bridge, in which
the workstations for everyone but Engineers reside.  The Captain has a large
stateroom, and his Executive officer has a small stateroom.  The rest of the
crew are relegated to bunks.

The ship carries enough fuel for several years of operating capacity without
stops, and is frequently sent on that sort of long-haul.

Note:  The price of the ship takes into account the 25% discount on QSDS designs

Virus information tonight, I thought I\'d share two quotes.  But first...

If you want a copy, they may still ahve one in the hobby shop down here.
Last time I was there (about a month ago, now) they had one of everything
including a Traveller TNE Tee Shirt.  If anyone is interested, I can look
for something for you, and I also know of a store that might have some stuff
in Greenville, SC where I used to live.  (I live on the Mississippi coast,
anyone nearby??)

Now, on to the quotes...

This first one is the information from Survival Margin that I said I would
look up.  If any one is interested, it comes from page 92, midway down the
left hand column.  Subject: Virus  (/text/ - italics & _text_ - bold)

             "Remember, the virus is a /plot device/ to bring us from 
        _MegaTraveller\'s_ Rebellion into the New Era\'s New Dawn; it is not /the 
        plot/ of _Traveller: The New Era_.  The New Era is not about travelling 
        around space trying not to get infected by the virus.  The virus still 
        exists, but is under a certain amount of control by then.  But the
virus 
        is the one harrowing experience that everyone will have shared between 
        now and then.  Londoners remember the Blitz, Americans remember
Vietnam, 
        and _Traveller: The New Era_ characters remember the Collapse."

The second quote is, I think, my favorite quote from all of the TNE
material.  IMHO, this quote sums up the feelings and life of the members of
the RC who regularly operate in the wilds.  Here it is from Path of Tears
page 5.

             "...Big Meg Enders was the one who said, \'Bongo, I think you\'re 
        Senior.\'
             "So, I was.  Between it being a small team and Dum-Dum away with 
        the Navy, I was Senior at Table for the first time ever, which is no
big 
        deal except you have to offer the toast.  In some services I\'ve heard 
        the junior rank present offers the toast, but for usit\'s always been 
        Senior.  It\'s always the same toast; how many hundred times have I
heard 
        it?  How many hundred dinners?  So I stood up, cleared my throat, and 
        started the toast.
             "\'Brothers and sisters--to...\'  And then I stopped, because all of 
        the sudden I couldn\'t say anything around the knot in my throat.  I 
        couldn\'t see very well either.  I\'d seen others choke up giving the 
        toast, but they were all old farts.  Not like me.  How the hell did I 
        get here?  How was I Senior at this table?  Where were all the others?  
        All the people who\'d taught me, watched over me, helped me live this 
        long?  Some were still alive, still whole, but not enough of them.  Not 
        nearly enough.  On over a dozen worlds I\'d left behind friends and 
        pieces of friends until it was my turn to stand up and give the toast, 
        because there wasn\'t anybody else here who\'d lasted this long.  If you 
        live long enough, I remember someone saying, you lose everything.
             I started again.  \'Brothers and sisters--to absent friends.\'"

I recall one of my Caltech friends relating that a virus had been
discovered that had infected a variety of different platforms (Mac, DOS,
OS/2, etc.) using the macro functions already inherent in some programs.
Granted this limits the program to a specific brand of coding (I believe
in this case it was some Microsoft product), but it was not limited by the
platform upon which those were operating.  So in a sense, this can bridge
the gap, as it would be unfeasable to have a huge number of coding systems
just to foil a virus...the line between the necessity for system
protection and the necessity for compatiblity between systems would be a
fine one.

Btw, the content of the virus was "This should be enough to prove my
point."

If anyone is interested in more specifics, drop me a line, and I
will dig up what I can find.

This is kind of an unfair challenge, since Lucan had TL15 technology and
knowledge at his disposal.  8-)

This arguement can be used to explain almost everything in the Traveller
universe.  It is only when this information falls within someone\'s area of
expertise when things start to fall apart.  I myself cringe every time my
players attempt to build and/or replair anything technical (without the *proper*
tools or even a dedicated specialty machine shop)!  How about this... "Virus
*evolved* to do the damage it did, and threaten those it hadn\'t."

At first, Virus infiltrated and destroyed the computer systems at the Imperial
core.  It did this relatively easily since it was, in fact, created inside a
computer on a research station belonging to Lucan\'s faction.  After many
mutating generations, Virus is said to have gained sentience.  At this point,
Virus could use information in surviving Imperial computers (that discussed how
the computers of its neighbours functioned) to modify itself to infiltrate and
take over those systems.  Virus might have even built prototypes of these
computers for testing.

Perhaps some of these vessels surrendered to the Vargr, Aslan, Hivers, K\'kree,
etc. allowing them to download Virus and begin the spread throughout each race\'s
region of space.  Multiple attempts might have had to have been made, but by
simply surrendering (instead of trying to force-feed Virus into the enemy\'s
computers), these attempts might have gone more-or-less unnoticed.  All it would
take is one or two greedy corsairs (who would be more than happy to lay claim to
a drifting derelict).

    'body' => 'I like the ideas expressed in the original post (basing the Imperium on the
Roman Empire), and they chime with an idea I was having over the weekend.  
I wanted a model that gave an empire of manageable size (a subsector, say)
that could be incorporated into the canon background (because I like the
official background history). I also wanted a model that would allow a
powerful nobility to adopt its historical role - protection racketeers who
can make the law to suit themselves. I felt that by adopting a model from
history I would be able to "predict" how the empire would work without
having to do too much development work on the background.  Finally, I wanted
the core inhabited area to be surrounded by interstellar wilderness to allow
for "Space, the Final Frontier..." type adventures.

Here\'s the bacground I was thinking about...

//START
At the onset of the Long Night (or perhaps sometime after the Virus) the
population of a former subsector capital takes advantage of the
political/economic chaos to replace Imperial rule with a popularly elected
(liberal or social) democracy, stripping the local military/aristocratic
elite of much of their power and prestige.  

As the Long Night progresses, anti-democratic forces in the military and
economic spheres are able to insinuate (through their control of the popular
media) that the real cause of economic decline is decadent democracy and
that what the planet needs is a Strong Leader, not endless parliamentary
babbling.  "It was\'nt like this in the Good Old Days", they muse.  This
point of view receives a sympathetic hearing amoungst those most sorely hit
by economic decline.  Terrorist activity, covertly financed by
anti-democratic forces, becomes a constant threat while the popular media
rail against the government\'s inability to protect the citizens.

As the economic crisis deepens, war with neaby systems becomes inevitable.
After concluding a war sucessfully the victorious admiral is supported in
his election campaign by the popular media.  On his election he declares a
state of emergency, appoints a Commitee for Public Safety and suspends
parliament until the end of the crisis.  Any source of alternative power,
including ambitious elements of the former Imperial nobilty, are quietly
liquidated over the next few years.

Of course, the crisis does\'nt end. Modestly accepting the title of First
Citizen, the former admiral humbly dedicates himself to fighting to preserve
the planet\'s freedom and restoring its former glory.  The insignia of the
old Imperium (or perhaps the Terran Confederation) start to be incorporated
into government symbols.

After twenty years of more or less continuous war First Citizen succeeds in
"pacifying" his neighbours and in bringing if not prosperity, then at least
economic stability.  He then dies.

A crisis of sucession looms.  One candidate, a sucessful admiral from an old
noble family, is able to marry First Citizen\'s daughter (she does\'nt get a
say in the matter) and then bribes surviving noble families (who were always
somewhat ambivalent about First Citizen) into backing his claim.  With the
support of the Navy he seizes power.  Shortly afterwards he is "offered" the
title of Emperor by his noble allies, on the grounds that they are the only
known survivors of the Imperial Senate (Moot, whatever it was during the
Second Empire)and that they are simply exercising their right to elevate a
new Emperor.
In return, the Emperor restores a number of rights and privileges to the
nobility and places them in administrative roles on "pacified" worlds.

I did goof a bit here, I should have said the Moot. But thinking about 
this, I believe that my goof is correct to a point. 

The Sylean government morphed into the Third impirium with a lot of its 
own institutions changing seamlessly into Impirial ones. The idea of a 
body of nobles appearing in Year 0  to take over the control of the 
Senate/Moot is a bit silly. The Senate would proberbly change into the 
Moot when a large body of nobles occur (or all the Senate get instant 
nobility).

I think this is one of the better results of GDW\'s demise: By 
closing up, they have left the rest of the background unexplored, free
for the referee to develop it\'s own material from the small tidbits
and clues they left behind, without the imminent fear of being
invalidated a couple of months later! I feel that this has always been
the one worst problem with a background being detailed more and more
or worse, the history of the campaign moving along and changing things
differently than they happened in the game..... This is what i REALLY
liked about CT: It was static, all adventures could be played, no
matter what the Characters did (Vmpire Fleets, for example can be
ruined by charakters doing the wrong thing, like destroying Sandman,
because they don\'t trust them, thereby rewriting the entire RC History
(as viiewed from the future).

I hope ImperiumGames adoptes the older approach as well, that while
detailing a Milieu as far as nessessary to the point that afer 3-4
Sourcebooks, they move on to the next milieu that would be far enough
away in time and space as to not invatilidating the old campaigns that
may have developed.

I am really looking forward to the old and new Traveller,

Originally I thought this was where it was going to.  But I\'ve been 
reading the Challange "Traveller News Service issues back in the 40\'s and 
50\'s and things are already starting to get way beyond any kind of easy 
reconsiliation.  Those issues cover from about 1120-1123.

I thought so to but it was really the only way to bring back any kind of 
harmony to the imperium.  Wipe the slate clean and begin again, if any 
one side had won it would have justified all those deaths.

GDW did publish several Pocket Empires.  Unfortunately these areas were 
often to widely dispuresed in order to see any real competition 
immediatly.  But after time that would have to change.  As the empires 
got bigger they\'d have to run into each other and begin either unifying 
or competing.

Don\'t forget the Fiery, an equally capable piece of gear.  Unarmed 
merchant ships would not be unprotected.  They shipped a lot of cargo 
across the atlantic in "unarmed" cargo ships.

I can remember watching other players in CT generate 75 year old Grand

This is kind of difficult to theorize upon.  I know from having read most 
of the NE source books and such that there\'s a real negative impression 
of anything Imperial in the RC.  In fact refering to someone as 
"Imperial" is about as big an insult as there is.  

	"In Coalition usage, it has also come to mean demostrating 
	arrogant or shortsighted views, particularly when combined with 
	conspicuous and undeserved wealth."
					(Path of Tears: 28)

Perhaps though, given the amount of social changes that have occured in 
the Regency over the last 70 years.  "What do you mean the title Baron 
doesn\'t mean anything anymore?"  It is possible that there could be some 
kind of reconsiliation.  The key phrase to remember when thinking about 
the Coalition is "continuous and unstopable social revolution."  The 
people of the Coalition would likely never accept an Emperor as anything 
more than a figure-head and I think most liberal Pocket Empires are the 
same.

As an example of social change.

***SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT***





In 1202, NE2, the world of Nike Nimbus is beaten upon sevearly by a Midu 
Agasham Vampire.  By 1203, NE3, the Coalition is infecting its own 
computers with a new strain of Virus in order to increase it\'s own 
effectiveness.  This is a source of extreme tension with the Regency as 
perhaps the Virus has a further social impact on the people of the RC.  
Many military individuals would probably have radically different views 
of the virus after this.

Even in AD&D, you only rarely get to buy your equipment at the price
listed in the book.  If you have an imaginative enough DM, you even get to
roleplay the purchase of gear, even down to the haggling. 

PC: "I bought my last shipment of iron for Cr2000 per ton!" 

Trader: "Yes, but this planet [size 3] doesn\'t have many metals, and I\'ve
got a wife and three kids to buy vacc suits for! I\'m cutting me own throat
to let you have the gear so cheaply!" 

Try looking at it this way: 
	Book 2 rules: quick-and-dirty for an off the cuff trading nugget
	Book 7/MT rules: average values useable to work out how megacorps
get their money, as they are easily worked into a generic trade system
order to average out large numbers of trade negotiations.
	Home grown: fully detailed trade rules (eg. Rob Miracle\'s, or
mine). 

What I did was to combine all the trade systems, plus the trade article
from Challenge #27 (? correct number?), in order to greatly expand the
availavble cargo list. Andrew Madden promised to create a database to load
it into (it\'s only on paper at present), but is snowed under at present
(aren\'t we all?). 

Note that the Challenge article allowed me to use generic top-level tables
for Industrial, Agricultural, Resource (all those non-industrial worlds),
Ice-capped, Water, and Vacc Worlds. There is even a General Cargo table
(thus addressing Charles\' request). From the high-level tables, i work
down thru more detailed tables to get the cargo result.  Some things *are*
shipped in std cargo containers (I might even ship off an article about
these to MM!?), other things are individually boxed, and some small
high-value items are in smaller boxes. Remember, these are _trade goods
from the PC\'s standpoint_. All the bulk big stuff is shipped by people
like Al Morai on 4000t bulk traders, or even bigger ships run by the
megacorps. See Andrew Madden\'s breakdown on potential trade in the Marches
- - the amount of stuff shipped is HUGE!! The PC\'s (equivalent of tramp
freighters, unless they own a shipping line) only trade in the "dregs", if
you like - but even these miniscule amounts of cargo (sniffed at by
megacorps) can be very valuable *for them*. 

I *did* put in task rules to find, buy, and sell cargo (as noted by Rob
Miracle), but I noticed that Rob alluded to a few wrinkles I didn\'t think
of, such as rolls for damaged goods, allowances for cargo perishability,
etc. 

John Macpherson said:
> I think the scenario you have scetched above is _exactly_ why the

A reasonable argument. The Imperium, as many have pointed out, protects
the "free trade between the stars". 

However, he also said:
> Secondly, I was under the impression that
>interstellar wars were strictly forbidden by the Empire, nukes or not.

Only if they interrupt trade in a big way (see Book4). 

Wes Payne said:  >I could have picked >a more radical difference, such as
the cost-per-ton of precious gemstones >as opposed to simple mineral ore. 

I just changed the amount available - as in Bk2 where you could pick up
2D*300t (?or so) of wood, but only 1D tons of gems, 1D ATV\'s etc.

Oh, I don\'t know, Dr Habius Corpus sounds fine by me. ;-)

Currently, we have the following nick-names in use: 

	Name 			Race 	Nickname
	Eoraokortitrikhuie 	Aslan 	"Huey" 
	Ervmisbe 		Droyne 	"Irving" 
	Rialtelsupremo 		Droyne 	"El Supremo" 

It just depends on your POV, I guess... 

3. TRADEMARKS

Yes, a legal anomaly that leaves a lot to be desired. Someone steals your
car or wallet, the police can chase them. Someone steals your traemark,
and *you* must chase them. 

...probably invented by smart lawyers to keep them rich (only a *joke*,

There are a few - generally specialised, high-tech miniature submersibles.
The problem is that they are high-tech, hideously expansive, require
constant maintenance... this analogy just gets better and better. 

>I think any jump capeable ship will have at least (minimal) a >crew of

Exceptions are ships that are regularly serviced (such as xboats or
in-service scouts) or ruggedised (again, scouts). Maybe the dreaded TNE
"Wear Value" can actually be used for something, after all.

No.  The RC as of 1201 has one TL12 world and the rest are in the TL10-8 
range with the exception of Spires which is at TL2

This is absolutly true.  Although but the time 1201 rolls around the 
words nobility in the Regency don\'t mean a damn thing and they\'ll mean 
even less in the future.  Given this plus the Virus thing and I think 
there\'s a real possiblitiy for conflict here.  At least their starships 
are fairly evenly sized.  The Regency also arms its Marine and Army APC\'s 
with low yeild Tac-Nukes, something that the RC would never consider 
doing, given the number of glowing planets still out there in the wilds.

I have however, come across a number of other quotes that makes me wonder 
otherwise.  Damned if I can find them though.  Ah yes here it is.

	"Both groups used surprise and terror to minimize their 
	casualties, as the small groups were always outnumbered by the
	lower tech defenders.  Finally, both groups eventually settled

	portions of their own culture with the local culture."

				Dr, Eneri Kuniholm
				Mora, Deneb, 1235
				(Survival Margin, p88)
				(TNE, p86)

and there\'s something in one of the source books (PoT?) about a more 
unlikely group practically destined to fail but the Hivers chose them and 
how now we can only look back and marvel at how well they did succeed.

WHo know\'s whether the Star Viking\'s methods were harsh, personally I 
think not and given the same circumstances I think we\'d all behave in a 
similer fashion.  Perhaps the Regency is simply judging them harshly 
because other than the "Rape of Trin" they have no real common reference 
frame as to what these people went through in the collapse.

OK...first of all.  Any science fiction requires suspension of 
disbelief.  In real life present terms, everything proposed by ANY 
version of Traveller is impossible in present day physics (No FTL 
travel, and current laws of physics deem it impossible, No cold 
fusion, No thruster plates, no HEPlaR, no meson guns)

So let\'s leave out present day comparisons.  Let\'s assume that 
computers are a whole lot more advanced than they currently are.  
Hardware and software both can do things that we can\'t envision 
today.  Hardware uses parallel circuitry to more accurately simulate 
living thought processes, and is semi-self aware BEFORE Virus hits.  
Now imagine the type of software that could run on such machinery.  

The nature of life is that life figures out a way to adapt.  If the 
hardware is almost alive, the software is going to be like that as 
well.  Now imagine a parasite (the chips) taking control of such a 
semi-self aware system.  Being intelligent, the parasite will be 
slowed, but not stopped by other countermeasures.  Hell, being 
intelligent, it\'ll be able to take advantage of the control and 
monitoring systems to convince the computer operator that he\'s fixed 
the problem.  Hell, viruses work this way now within 1 OS to a 
certain extent, and if you\'re to believe the SF of Traveller, we\'re 
using stone axes compared to what\'ll be possible at TL 15.  What\'s to 
say that such a virus might not be developed to more closely resemble 
the real thing...

No, under current technology, its as unbelievable as FTL travel.  But 
when has SF been real worried about following the laws of physics (or 
computer science in this case)...  All SF is only hard to a certain extent, 
because frankly, science is only hard to a certain point.  It\'s not like we\'ve 
learned everything we\'re ever going to learn, and some of what we\'re 
going to learn is going to throw yesterday\'s pet theories in the 
trash heap...

I challenge you to find 2 adequately defended systems in the Marches

I would like to note I have 
never seen  too much detail when it came to computing systems in Traveller. 
Even back in the days of CT even though there were no Paralel are other strange
computer  architectures, they were discussed in Science Fiction and in the 
field of computer science so CT could have imagined rules for these kind 
of things. 

I think the argument about different architectures is really kind of 
nit-picky when it comes to the Virus. I think a better argument against 
the Virus is that it was a cheap way of destroying the Imperium which 
released GDW from writing a length history of how things were finally 
destroyed. 

I think it also goes against things that I recognized as Traveller-esque, 
such as an enemy that has racial motivations, etc. If they were going to 
destroy the Imperium with an alien, I think they would have been better off
doing something like bringing an Alien from another Galaxy or through a Jump 
Portal or something.

Ships such as the Yugos exist in my campaign, but are always part of cargo

That\'s why Free Traders and Far Traders are weapons capable.

The thing with Virus that you have to remember is it\'s not only very 
sophisticated but it\'s also alive.  Imagine if you will that you:
1)have a 100% photographic memory, and
2)have 100% motor control.
Now add into the mix that you know how to drive a Yugo.  Assume that you 
spent 24 hours (you don\'t need to sleep either) watching a driver, drive 
a bus.  Think you could drive that bus?  Probably, the idea is the same 
between the car and the bus.  Now imagine you\'ve spent 24 hours inside 
and M1 tank watching the crew, think you could drive the tank.  Again 
probably you\'ve learned the basics while sitting there, sure you might 
drive through a house but you could drive it.

The analogy is the same for the virus.  It sneaks into the system (it is 
possible to get an IBM virus on a Mac it may not work but the code is 
still in there) and sits there for days watching and learning about 
what\'s going on in the system.  Once the virus feels comfortable in comes 
out and takes over.

Not so, the Virus resides in specific chips, of it\'s decisions of course, 
from these chips it "reaches out" and subverts the system.  Destroy those 
chips and you\'ve destroyed the computer, it\'s finding those chips that\'s 
the hard part.

Not even going to try on the Virus thing.  Don\'t know enough about code 
and never ever really felt inclined to learn.  Odd isn\'t it?  I spend 4-8 
hours a day on this and I\'ve never been concerned with how to build the 
programs.

In theory you could do this, the overrides that is.  Passive sensors pick 
up everything in the area.  These signals are then passed through a 
"computer" which interprets the signals and sends the data to you.  
Active sensors do the same thing.  When the ship is largely automated 
these signals would be routed though several computers, all monitered by 
the main computer.  Sensors are the perfect method of infection, they\'re 
processing so much information virus could easily slip past the 
anti-virus programs of the 3rd Imperium.  Remember when a new virus comes 
out now it takes weeks for a cure to appear on the net.  By that time 
with Virus it\'s to late.

I love this quote.  My GM gave it to me to read after a mission, which 
still isn\'t over by the way, where we\'d lost over half the party due to 
varying circumstances.  It\'s a pretty powerful statement when read under 
those contexts.  Something I\'m sure everyone can relate to in game terms.

No one really know\'s.  The RC, is busy focusing its drive Coreward from 
the Old Expances.

I would imagine that the Solomani fell before Virus too.  Seeing as they 
problably designed or used compatable computers with the Imperium.  Terra 
would be able to rebuild quickly as there\'d be hard copy data on the 
development of all those technological goodies.  Worlds on the Solomani 
frontiers probably had no idea what hit them.

We can postulate, with nearly 100% certianty, that there is a pocket 
empire based out of the sol system.  It only stands to reason.

This I felt was one of TNE\'s greatest strengths.  The RC was small enough 
that the indvidual heroics of a dedicated few could make a difference.  
Where as in CT, the Imperium was so huge and had so much momentum the 
efforts of an individual were swallowed up and rarely made a difference.

Actually that\'s exactly where Grumble got the name.  He then modified the

Two thoughts:

1)  Computers do not /have/ to be binary.  In the Far Future, trinary 
computers (or some other type) may be used in addition to binary computers.

2)  Even if all computers are based on a binary system, the archetecture 
still has to be similar for a program to run.  Example:  take any 
Wintel-compatible program.  It is in a binary, executable format.  Put this 
program on some other archetecture.  It will not run without an 
interpreter/emulator.  The specific instructions the binary values cause 
to occur vary depending on the microprocessor(s) used, among other 
things.  

Or were you thinking along different lines when you made the comment above?

Not much changed, except the cost of the ship went up some 20% due to 
needing more powerplant.

Jump 1 version

			Sensors 1A 3P 0J
Armor	0		Structure	6 (Box Streamlined)

Using the full crew rating, and Book 2 figures for costs, assuming a full 
cargo hold, the jump 1 version is profitable after 11 trips/year, the 
jump 2 after 14.

(A trip is calculated as 1 week in jump/1 week out.) That puts a maximum 
of 23 trips/year, since 2 weeks/year are given over to maintenence. This 
also assumes buying unrefined fuel at 100 cr/ton. If you\'re cheap and 
scoop your own fuel, that adds 2kCr for the J1 and 4 kCr to the J2 
version per trip of profit.

				Profit (loss) /trip	(kCr)			
				J1			J2
Trips/Year	5	(239.18)	5	(246.28)
			10	(48.59)	10	(53.14)

			20	46.71 	20	43.43
			23	59.13 	23	56.03

Multiply this figure times the number of trips to calculate the total 
profit/loss on an annual basis.

The change in ship cost increases the number of trips/year for 
profitability to 14.

Of course, this design doesen\'t allow for much in the way of surviving a 
fight (or running away), it\'s the spacelanes equivalent of a tramp 
frieghter or Liberty Ship...cheap holes in space.

Now I have to stic my 0.02Cr in.  If piracy is so rampant that any 
ship has to go out armed to the teeth to survive, there is no 
Imperium.  The citizens and member worlds are paying a significant 
chunk of credits every year in taxes to the Imperium for one reason, 
and one reason only...to ensure the safety of trade. Notice the only 
things the Imperium does vis-a-vis member worlds is enforce trade 
rules inter world and intersystem. If the Imperium isn\'t going to 
protect them, why should they pay anything? 

The YugoBus will come along later, but I\'ve actually got work to do 
now....

But I\'m glad someone got the GoodHumorMan joke...

Mmmm.  The Virus wouldn\'t be able to watch and learn while on the system, 
without first knowing how to execute on the system.  I\'d imagine the 
Virus would form "children" of some sort and shoot those into the 
system.  These spawned tasks would be programmed to send back messages to 
the Virus describing success/failure, etc.  If no message was received, 
then the Virus would form a different spawned task and do it again.  As 
you said, the Virus has perfect memory, etc. and has tons of time.  
Eventually, it would be possible for the Virus to find out how to execute 
on another archetecture in this way, translate itself, and then move in.

At least, that\'s my take on how it would be possible for a self-aware 
program to spread throughout all computers.

To be totally honest with you, my Imperium\'s Pirates are much like those 
detailed in the space-operatic "Bio of a Space Tyrant" series by Piers 
Anthony.  There, I said it and I\'m glad. :)

For those unfamiliar with that series, the pirates are rather ruthless, 
ubiquitous, organized, and politically well-connected.

Absolutely.  It\'d be stretching things too much (IMO) to expect a 
frontier area like the Spinward Marches to be /that/ secure.

I\'m not sure I understand how a trinary system would work.  In computers 
somethings either off "0" or its on "1" there\'s no middle of the road 
when it comes to electricity.  Currently that is.

This is true but the basic building blocks of all that it binary.  Though 
binary Virus could enter any computer.  Binary is merely the door.
 
After getting in we have to remember that Virus is not merely a computer 
program, it is a living, breathing, (okay so technically it doesn\'t 
breath) entity, that never forgets and lives inside computers.  The 
Virus, being rudamentally (that\'s not the right word is it?) intelligent, 
finds an out of the way circut and sits there watching the data flow.  
Like a person sitting at a window watching traffic Virus soon figures out 
which bundles of information are going where and presumably by following 
these bundles figures out what they do.  From here Virus modifies it\'s 
own code to absorb the knowledge contained within the system and there by 
subverts it.

Keeping in mind that this entity was modified in the 57\'th (?) century 
I\'m sure they\'d have copies of all the major computer types and given how 
valuable information is now a days I\'m sure they\'d have translation 
programs written for every computer type know.  With this kind of 
information at it\'s "finger tips" I\'m sure that given enough time Virus 
could subvert any computer.

The problem Virus has is when it\'s running into multiple computer types 
in a small area.  Some will computers will be figured out faster and 
individuals with the other computers will possibly have time to shut 
things down before the virus can get a propper foot hold in their system.

Virus is intelligent.  Dulinor\'s flagship Clarion was infected near Core, 
the Virus figuring out that Dulinor was heading else where sat there 
quitely waiting for the opportunity to infect other computers along that 
retreat route.  If the ship doesn\'t begin to act up you\'d never figure 
out it was infected and just like Typhoid Mary you\'d go merrily about 
your buisness accidentally infecting people with something you didn\'t 
know you had.

It was pretty average in the games I played too.  You\'d just get those

But I doubt the senate could meld seamlessly.  Remember, the Moot really 
has only one power - *to dissolve the Imperium.*  The Sylean Senate 
probably had much more power.  Possibly, the senate turned into the heads 
of the Imperial beaurocracy?

In theory why would it not be able to watch?  Given the millions of tasks 
our computers are executing a second if it sent these "children" off to 
follow the information bundles and report back.  Should it not be able to 
figure out most of the computer passively?  In a minute to us a Virus 
would be able to observe millions of operations.  On a 57th century 
starship it would be able to obseve Trillions of operations (or a billion 
if your english 8)  ).  By sending out and bringing back it\'s children it 
should be able to figure things out in a matter of days without having to 
do much of anything actively.

And a great take it is.  Do you think GDW had these descussions before 
they implemented the Virus plan?

Well said!

This is true of many of the arguments we have here.  So much of what 
we\'re dealing with is pure conjecture (or, theory, if you prefer:).  We 
may have pretty mathematical formulae that "prove" this or that, but 
until the theories are proven by actual experience, they\'re just so much 
hot air.  And hardly worth arguing about.

We (as a species) don\'t know as much as we think we do. ;-)

folx who are saying \'computer have different achitectures, different

necessarily operated via binary, and anyway those binary instructions are 
encoded differently on different computers.

Not *all* the computers were necessarily even electronic (i seem to 
remember optical computers at one time....)  


But fundamentally when you look over the systems that are affected by 
virus, they all do at least *one* thing that is the same.....

The have communications.

That\'s *how* it spreads...so i have to ask myself, what does this mean?

It means that there is 1) a standard for communications, or at least a 
set of standards, and 2) that most of the computers designed were using 
communications of some *sort* of other....

In my working life, most every computer that i\'ve used, that had more 
power than a caclulator was connected to something else, usually on a 
network.  Now we\'ve had standalone networks, that never talk to anything 
else, but those computers were few and far between.

I\'m willing to bet that it\'s reasonable to assume, with all the 
computers/robots/etc that are in TNE that most of them are setup for 
communications (how do you control the robots? through a computer?)

definitely all the ships had to have some sort of standard for 
communication...

Now, why, konwing this, it wouldn\'t be impossible to circumvent, i 
*don\'t* know.  That\'s my *other* problemwith the virus.

Now the Virus is an intelligent program, and has the ability to 
think....It is reasonable to assume, that given that it can probably 
probe a target system using the communications, to then try and get some 
hold on how it works...what it\'s weakspots are, etc.

There are also a finite number of different computer systems, meaning 
that the Virus probably has experience with all or most of these, giving 
it an advantage...at least by the time we start seeing virus ships in TNE.

For a good book to read (and an ancient one b/c it talks about IBM 360\'s 
and \'teleprocessing ports\' *chuckle*) there is The Adolescence of P1, a 
program that is very similar to a benign controller-virus.

You know, I typed "one of us..one of us...," then got unsure of myself, 
erased it, and typed the "join us" that I eventually sent.  It figures 
that it\'d be wrong, after I put that effort into it. <G>

Actually, it WAS a naturally occuring silicone lifeform that latched onto

Oh, Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me Now Sweetheart: OBAFGKMNS are the types...
O, B, N, and S are all too rare for a 2d roll, or even a 3d roll... and
since O and B are more likely to be interesting... they\'re added to
Traveller (IMHO).

as for the Roman Numbers, look at hte ages of the stars... the lower the
number, the older the star (generally, but not totally true, AFAIK).

Check again, Backman... I\'ve seen it used in chemical angineering texts
(beloning to my chemical engineer of a father) for flow volumes... and his
texts are from the 1960\'s! also, since the metric system is based upon
consistant sets of order of magnitude prefixes, and set base units, with
some overlap (Tons metric vs megagrams; same thing, both valid
measurements, until you start doing wierd things like moment and
accelleration calculations, where units are often specific to the order of
magnitude of the outcome, and a slipped decimal can be fatal...)

Some common units and their alternative (scientific/metric) measurements
Kilolitres      m^3
cc\'s            ml      both used interchangeably
metric ton      1000kg          1E6 grams aka 1 megagram

the Litre is the standard unit of metric volume; litres per second is the
standard unit of metric flow. (Perry\'s). If you want m^3, divide litres by
1000.

Terra   1E12    T       I can\'t remember the orders for Hekto, Fempto, Pico,
Giga    1E9     G       nano, micro, or anything above terra. (I don\'t use
Mega    1E6     M       those measures enough)

I hate me too\'s but mine tended to be about 5 terms.  Most players 
who did 4 would usually hold on 1 more term to get a pension.  But 
this was not always true.

Dave Golden is American, but DGP didn\'t invent the kilolitre.  It is a
perfectly valid metric unit - just not used very much (if at all).  If I
remember correctly, Joe Fugate said once they chose it because the
abbreviation (kL) could be done without superscripting.  This is important,
because while ASCII is universal, superscripting is word processor-specific

Unless, of course, a Virus was able to take advantage of the large amount
of military hardware located on and around Earth, and blast the planet to
cinders.  There\'s a good chance that, in the New Era, Earth is an
uninhabitable radioactive nightmare, currently going through nuclear winter,
and with the largest land-dwelling animal remaining the cockroach.

If you\'re going to do Armageddon and Dark
Future a\'la T:TNE, at least do it right.

One straightforward way to build a trinary computer would be to use
three-phase alternating current to represent the signals, instead of direct
current used by computers here-and-now on Earth.  The three distinct phases
would then be 0, 1, and 2.

Even if built out of silicon, such computers would bear almost no
resemblance to digital-logic machines.  Even the fundamental building blocks
such as logic gates and memories would be radically different.

There have been a number of computers built that do not use binary.  One of
the more famous was ENIAC.  It used streams of pulses to carry data (a lot
like the dialing signals from a rotary telephone), so that a single wire
could carry any value from 0 to 9.

Binary is used today because it\'s efficent, easy to understand, and easy to
implement in silicon.  There\'s no reason that computers in the Far Future
have to use binary, or have to be silicon-based.

That\'s rather like saying that English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish
all use the approximately the same alphabet.  Therefore, if you study an
engineering textbook in one of those languages long enough, you\'ll eventually
become entirely fluent in it, to the point of being able to compose poetry.

Actually, this was deliberate.  Some goods are more common (eg. wheat in
Canada, coal in Newcastle...) and I wanted to somehow reflect this in the
table.  Personally, I would be inclined to put most of the obscenely
profitable goods out on the ends of the tables, just to keep them uncommon.

Another option, which I tried and discarded, just use three levels of
variety:

Lo-population worlds got 1D
Mod-population worlds got 2D
Hi-population worlds got 3D

But I felt that this didn\'t adequately reflect the sheer size of a high
population economy.

This is correct.  But remember, when drawing deck plan, that the walls of
compartments _don\'t_ have to follow the boundaries of squares!

The technique I use is to place a small red (or gray) cross in the _middle_
of the square.  This way, my one-metre-wide corridors still have a marker to
place a miniature on, yet I don\'t have the silly situation of having
corridors the size of staterooms.

Call signs should be part of role playing.  Some people have call signs
others do not.  Some times the call signs are used only part of the time.
Fighter pilots tend to use their call sign more than their own name.  CB\'ers
use their call sign less than their real name (only in the field where the
name is applicable).  I don\'t think the game needs to suggest call signs as
the players will do that on their own if its important to them.

   The software in question was Micro$haft Word, and the "virus" was a
Word macro. Several points:

1) There is _no_ version of Word for OS/2
2) It\'s not a Virus, it\'s a Trojan; an entirely different kettle of fish.
3) It still won\'t work on _all_ systems, simply because it *requires* a
special software component to work. Remember, Virus can infect *any*
computer, a plainly ridiculous assumption - which is my whole point.

Actually, from the info in the TNE book, I\'ve always seen them as not harsh,
but doing what was needed.  Like it says somewhere, all of the galaxy\'s
worlds are needed for a proper soceity, so what right do they have to stay
stuck in the past (what\'s the exact quote, I\'ll have to look).

True.  And in 1201 they\'ve never been into the Wilds so they haven\'t even
seen things there either.  THey really have no frame of reference.

My players weren\'t gamblers, sadly.  Rarely did someone go to the fifth 
term, and take the additional aging risks on.  Sigh.

Oh, speaking of aging, I\'ve been thinking on this one lately:  How many 
years will a person who lives in a TL 15 society live on average?  
Traveller postulates that people will live about as long as they do now, 
when in fact life spans have been increasing as tech levels increase in 
the real world.  

Has anyone ever developed house rules for this sort of thing?  Heck, even 
200 year life spans would make sense.  Of course, this would ruin the 
play balance involved in the aging tables (but, IMHO, that isn\'t 
necessary with survival throws - the more terms you take, the more chance 
of your character dying).

Any thoughts on this?

It isn\'t designed to be a ship that cruises the dark alleys of the 
imperium looking for a fight.

Stuart challenges me to find a jump 1 route in the Spinward Marches 
that isn\'t dangerous...no sh*t sherlock...I said these ships ran in 
the Imperial CORE...the Marches have always been portrayed as a 
frontier sector, on the fringes of Imperial Space, they are NOT the 
\'protected core\' I was talking about. Give me the height of Imperial 
power, in the years befoore the Rebellion, and travel from Core to 
Vland and tell me how many pirates you\'ll find. The simple answer is 
none.

 It would be on the order of trying to sieze a large cruise ship 
in the Caribbean...you will attract a great deal of very unhealthy 
attention very quickly.  Those SDB\'s that the imperium has all over 
are there for this very purpose, and that\'s gonna suppress piracy.

If you want a \'little more dangerous\' Imperium, then by all means, 
have everyone run around armed to the teeth...all any potential 
Cleon 1 has to do is realize just how much money he could make and 
power he could amass by kicking out the pirates...other worlds and 
their attendant trade will flock to his banner in a 
heartbeat...that\'s why the wars of pacification were relatively 
minor, and why the Imperium grew so fast: trade was a hell of a lot 
safer.

	Besides, given what cheap freighters tend to carry, it would be a 
real pisser for a pirate to take one of them, and find out that 
they\'re the proud owners of several displacement tons of stuffed Mike 
the Ponii dolls, a crate or two of left handed widget gears, and 5 
copies of Microsoft Office 1098 (that accounts for the rest of the 
150 DT of cargo space ;-)

	Again, the Imperium exists to give trade protection to it\'s member 
states.  If it can\'t do that it won\'t exist.

overlooked is the fact that the main route of transmission were the 
ID transponders.

	Now, the description given of the evolution of the transponders (I 
don\'t remember in either Vampire Fleets or Survival Margin) shows one 
quick route into \'foreign\' systems.  Since the Imperium mandated the 
Deyo series of transponders for travel in the imperium, most foreign 
ships added them to their systems. Also, since the Deyo system 
actually required a link into the ships systems to function, the 
necessary hardware/software was there to facilitate virus 
transmission.

	As for adapting to new architectures, etc.  Remember this: these 
chips were evolved from life feorms that foound a bunch of hardware 
on a crashed Solomani ship and incorporated this stuff into their 
\'genetic code\'. This is what the Cybeline chips DO, how they evolve, 
by glomming onto circuitry and incorporating it.  Glomming onto 
unfamilar circuitry may take a while, but remember this was something 
designed as a weapon...it was designed to do, if not exactly what it 
did, something close to it. 

	IMO the other main reason for the rapid spread of Virus through the 
imperium is that computing systems had evolved along the lines they 
are now...more and more the network IS the computer.  Imperial ships 
were so vulnerable because all their computer systems were completely 
networked...that way an engineer could \'log in\' to the food service 
terminal in the cafeteria and check up on the status of the M-drives. 
 Perhaps a facetious example, but this is the kind of architecture 
that would allow such rapid spread of the Virus, AND ensure that it 
was in complete control of the ship when it was done.

  Oh really? Who\'s to say the Hivers or the K\'kree don\'t use ternary
logic? This has been a PIVOTAL factor in some s/f in the past. (and I
specifically had this in mind as one of the factors when I mentioned
differing architectures)

   There are two absolutely *CRITICAL* factors you have to understand
about viruses:

   1) They have to be executed to infect, that means they have to have
valid binaries for the computer in question *before* it is loaded into the
machine.

   2) Viruses don\'t "watch", they either run or they don\'t. See "1" above.

<sarcasm on>

   So tell me, how does range and targetting data get confused as orders
by this computer network?

<sarcasm off>

   Please explain how all this RAW DATA, which never gets loaded into
the CPU as code and can NEVER be executed by the computer, "gets past"
anti-virus defenses to infect the computer.

   Data is data, code is code, never the twain shall meet - you can
design a system that can accept code from the sensors, but the question
remains - WHY??? It increases vulnerability to things EXACTLY like we\'ve
been discussing for no good reason. I can\'t think of a single reason why
*any* ship designer would want to include this capability. Doing this to a
military vessel is the height of stupidity.

Right now, "0" is low voltage and "1" is anything above some voltage
limit...or vice versa.  Computers could be designed using different
voltage levels to represent different number systems, in fact in the
late 40\'s - early 50\'s there was experimental work done on this, both
with mechanical switchs and vacumn tube technology.  It was a *very*
complicated mess.  John von Neumann, among others, proposed dropping
attempts to make computers use complicated number systems, and stick
with the easier binary. For the time being..nobody said it couldn\'t be
done, just that it was taking too much effort and time with their
current technology.

If/when we transition to optical based and/or nano-mechanical
computers I expect we\'ll see *very* different hardware architectures. 
Optical and nano-mechanical systems are natural for parellel
operations, and >binary architectures.

Speaking of nano-mechanical systems, I can envision..barely, but
that\'s my limited imaganation <g>..self-modifing hardware systems. 
Picture millions of tiny mobile "nits" moving around on a chip
reconfiguring themselves to match some template.  You know how enzymes
and other organic molecules fit together matching to site
receptors...extend that to our little "nits" on the chip reconfiguring
based on a new template.  Now add advanced
"learning" algorithms (neural nets are where we are today), and
software can adapt AND change the hardware to meet changing conditions
by providing these templates.

So bringing it back to Traveller, if something like "Virus" could
exist there\'s your model.  Self-replicating, self-modifing, and above
some critical level *maybe* self-aware!

First reference I\'ve seen of their meeting is dated 1206 (?) from the 
back of Vampire Fleets.

By the time that quote is made many Reg operatives do have experience in 
the wilds.  Whether that fellow did or not I don\'t know.  But in 1201 the 
Regency has a rather misguided view of what to expect in the wilds.

	"The unspoken assuption seems to be that the universe will 
	welcome them back as liberators from the darkness.  The 
	possiblity that the Regency might have to fight wars for the 
	Hearts and Minds and real estate of those they would liberate has 
	not been rigorously examined."
					Recency Source Book: p5

They seem to have no idea as to the opinions of the vast majority of 
survivors in the NE nor have they bothered to do much ground work on 
finding this out.  The Regency has a very insular view where as the RC 
has a very external way of thinking.  This could be because the RC can 
afford to lose less equipment and men in the job to come so it has to do 
the ground work before it sends the troops in.  Where as in the Regency 
there is such a large economic machine, comparatively, at work that 
losing equipment is considered acceptable.

That\'s because 20th century virus\'s in computers aren\'t "alive."  They 
can\'t think, they can\'t plan, and they can\'t reason.  They just are and 
they do their job.

Chill Larry, that\'s pretty uncalled for.

It doesn\'t the virus is merely using the return echo as a method of 
entry.  This is the least desirable method of entry, passive sensor would 
be much more useful as they simply sit there and listen to everything 
that\'s going on around them.  Process the data and spit it out to us in a 
format that we can understand.

okay this makes sence so each (processor in the ciruct would also have to 
be connected to some kind of voltage meter to interpret the power pulse 
thus allowing more information to be transmitted in a shorter "pulse."

Okay that makes sence, basically our problem now is we\'re talking about 
something so advanced there\'s no way we can possibly comprehend what\'s 
going on without a PHD in nanotech.  I can accept that as a plausable 
explanation, if we assume the Virus subverts these nanites.

Sorry for the "me too", but I agree wholeheartedly.

In CT, you could have as much or as little stability as you wished.
For example, I once put together a "backwater" star cluster in the
Diaspora cluster. Even with the rebellion, the inhabitants did not
have to concern themselves with galactic politics (had the Solomani
decided to "recapture" this territory, the general populace would
not notice any real effect anyway). The local politics were *very*
volatile, but the overall campaign had a certain consistency about
it. However, as MT progressed (to TNE eventually), it became clear
that galactic events would have a *major* effect on this campaign,
forcing me to split it away from the "official" universe. I think
this is exactly the type of thing that soured many to Traveller.

    'topic' => '20 thoughts on virus',
    'body' => 'Rather than quoting a bunch of text and sending a reply, I\'ll just post my
personal take on Virus.

A few points need to be taken:

1. Virus is sentient.

2. Current computer Viruses (or is it Viri? :) can only take effect when
operated on, but by definition, a sentient virus could decide when it took
effect.

3. Virus gained sentience in a research station while connected to a vast
database.

4. The above mentioned research station was near the core of the Imperium.
The records in the database would have been the most extensive in the Imperium.

5. The above mentioned Virus would have had the capeability to infect any
other computer system it came into contact with that it had the opportunity
to study about.

6. All transponders (not just Imperial/human ships, but all ships travelling
in the Imperium) had a version of the Virus developed above.

7. The Virus in the above Transponders would have to be able to interface
with the alien computer systems as well as with the human ones.

8. Each time Virus is transmitted, the new starin is somewhat different in
make up than the originator, and it is an entirely new "creature."

9. the "bad virus" released from Lucan\'s research lab would have combined
with the existing transponder virus to form a new creature.

10.  This new creature would be able to interact both with it\'s new
environment, and with it\'s old transponder unit.

11. As a sentient creture, it could learn from its past.

12. The virus would learn that it could only infect a similar computer
structure through communications and sensors (which would be run through
computers or else why to you use a computer multiplier on the electronics
crew figures).

13.  The virus would know that it could only infect foreign computer systems
if it A: knew the system, or B: used the transponder.

14. Many Vargr ships would use a similar sturcture and system as the
Imperium from which it took much equipment (in the form of raiding).

15. The Hiver and Aslan both were occasional trading partners with the
Imperium, and their ships would have had transponders.

16. The Solomani and the Imperium traded sectors so often that they would
have wasted a lot of time if they couldn\'t interface each others equipment
directly.  Not to mention the first axiom of war, "Know your enemy!"

17.  The variety in the Aslan and the Technical expertise in the Hiver would
have slowed the progression of virus in their areas (a known fact).

18. If you doubt the similarity of the computer systems, think of the basis
for much of the technology, Grandfather.  Much of the technological
developments discovered after the "finding" of the jump drives by the major
races would be developed on the basis of the technology Gramps left behind
which would be similar.

19. Initially, the early virus (ie, the one from Lucan\'s research station)
was destructive in the same way the proverbial brainwashed marine is -- as a
war machine.  

20. Later forms of virus gained more of an ability to think beyond it\'s
original training, thus the "mother," "god," "reproducer" strains.

Just some thoughts.

And one to grow on.

21.  Virus was born, used, freed, and evolved.  The current (ie Sandman)
types of virus are much more logistic and controlled.

You\'re right, of course, but some of us still draw deck plans on

I\'m sure this works well, if you are a graphic artist, draftsman, or
are using a computer program to create your plans.
Personally, I have trouble drawing a straight line even with a
computer\'s help.  <g> So what\'s your advice for the artisticly

Actually, without considering artificial or cloned organ replacements, it
seems that the max will be around 100 to 150, and that is just extended
life, aging still sets in at around the same time in terms of lost
physical capacity, etc.

I use 100 for a baseline if players live in a high stellar type society,
about 200 for pure Vilani (admittedly rare in 1100).

Not true. Analog computers do exist. Binary computers largely replaced
them, but that is due to what technology was available (you can toss a
whole bunch of transistors on a chip). There is reason to believe that
analog computers will be making a comeback with some new technologies.

There have also been computers that used other basic data units (such
as decimal), although these don\'t seem to be making a comeback yet.

This topic was discussed to death before the TML split.

Sure, Virus can infect just about any computer. Sure, it can learn
about new systems (even those using different technologies). The
fundamental problem is assuming that *all* computers are vulnerable.
Certainly *some* computers would be "mathematically proven" to be
invulnerable. We see this today in military applications where a
particular technology is used because it is "trusted", though not
necessarily the most efficient. When an advanced "untrustworthy"
system is used, it is limited to certain physical connections and
monitored by a "trusted" system.

But then again, so what? It\'s only a game, right? Besides, only the
military would be capable of such a gross foul-up as letting the
Deyo transponders have "trusted" access to all systems when there
are three levels of trusted systems between the refrigerator door
switch and the light. :-) :-) :-)

In 1927, the New York Times blasted Robert Goddard for believing that men
could fly to the moon.  62 years later, on July 20th, 1969, the Times
printed a front-page retraction.

Bill Gates believed that no-one would ever need more than 640k RAM.. in
1981.. try running Windows on that.

The British Goverment expressed great concern over the steam locomotive,
since it was a known fact that at speeds greater than 40mph innocents would
die from having the air sucked out of their lungs.  (1830ish)

The list goes on and on.  We are talking about (A) a setting 3000 YEARS down
the line, and (B) a work of fiction designed to encourage an enviroment
condusive to exciting role-play.

We can all pick holes in what we find "wrong" with Traveller\'s backround,
based on our own expertise.  Craig finds flaws in the astronomy and physics,
others in the economics, and I get a good chuckle over the handling of the
military.  (BTW:  New Era got it right.. small elite teams working together
closely are the best in that kind of situation.)

My personal Holy Grail is the combat system.  Best?  HarnMaster for
medieval/fantasy, Milennium\'s End for modern day.  Why?  Because they are
the *closest playable thing to the reality I have witnessed*.  I have fired
thousands of rounds, been in the SCA, played paintball, and been to the
National Traing Center at Ft. Irvin, CA.  I study combat and military history.

Do I let this get in the way of enjoying the game?  Does the fact that the
Third Imperium back-story does not include dropping dino-killers mean that
I\'m going to throw the whole thing out and cry in my beer?  No.  I can
forgive a "loose" combat system if it works well in the context of the game.
I can also fill in the gaps in the history of the Imperium with cobbled up
"Just-So" stories.  Why doesn\'t the Imperium drop rocks?  They did in the
Pacification Campaigns.  Until public outcry forced them to stop.  (Don\'t
believe in public opinion?  Ask any Vietnam vet about "Rules of Engagement"
before and after the Tet \'68 offensive.)

To all the nay-sayers on the list, who insist that what is now is the way it

A computer magazine from 1985 that states that despite this new product from

The Mission Statement for the Imperial Navy probably boils down to:  Keep

Picture this:  A backwater system has been troubled by a pirate.  He\'s
picked of three or four merchants so far.  This is enough to slow the
economy as trader Captains avoid the place.

The local Baron petitions the Duke for help.  The Duke sends the 4873CruRon
to the affected system and surronds.  Once there, a sweep begins.  EVERY
ship is boarded a searched.  Backround checks, manifests, the works.
Meanwhile, fighters sweep the good hiding places (trojan points, rings,
etc.) looking for bases.  Eventually, the pirates are caught/killed.

This is good from three points:

1>  The Imperium looks good to the local populace

2>  The CruRon and Marines got some good training, not to mention a live
fire out of it.

3>  The planet gets the money flowing again.

I received the Deluxe Edition TNE boxed set today.  I\'ve only had a 
chance to read portions of it, so I can\'t make an final judgements yet.  
Some thoughts, though, will follow (warning: if the person reading this 
is incapable of intelligent discussion, please skip this message.  No 
matter what I say about TNE, it\'s going to be the opposite opinion of 
someone.  On the other hand, intelligent counter-points are welcome.)

So far, my feelings on the rules in general are:

1)  Geez, that\'s a lot of rules.  Almost a page and a half on initiative 
alone!!  Complete?  Yes, but daunting.

2)  I love the section on "Using the Rules," especially the first three 
paragraphs.  This sort of sentiment should be included in all 
role-playing games.

3)  Gadzooks, the editing was bad.  Just reading a few sections, I\'ve 
found a lot of grammatical errors and typos.  Now, I\'m not a fanatic 
about this.  Professionally published novels, with distribution far 
greater than any RPG, have errors in them.  And, this is a BIG book.  
Still, I hope IG does a better job of editing.

4)  Characters:  

	a) Lots of classes...that\'s fine by me.  Like the rest of 
the book, it just adds to the task before the beginning referee.  But, if 
you\'ve already got it in your mind to make a 400 page rule book, might as 
well have plenty of classes.

	b) The character generation process is workable, I don\'t knock 
that.  But I still like the old system better.

	c)  Nice skill list.

	d)  The characteristics are screwy.  Agility instead of 
dexterity...fine.  But adding charisma?  And the whole idea of putting 
Social Standing off to the side is rather silly.  Were they afraid of 
making it seven basic characteristics (or eight, with psionics)?  I admit 
I don\'t understand the thinking behind this.  Maybe it will come clear as 
I read further.

	e)  I could do without the text prior to the generation 
information for each character type.  It seems hokey to me.  


5)  NPC\'s:  They give the GM a way to randomly determine 
NPC personalities (using a standard deck of cards), but then they make a 
hand-wave when it comes to NPC appearance generation.  Okay, NPC 
motivations are more important than their looks.  But, again, if you\'re 
trying to make a very complete RPG (as they obviously were, with that 1.5 
page initiative section, among others), why not throw in a table for NPC 
appearance generaton, with modifiers for motivation/personality type.


That\'s it for now.

Well, they don\'t necessarily have to have a full-blown system defense
system.  Say some venture capitalist picks up six of the YugoThingys and
three mustered out close escorts.  Two escorts escort the cargo carriers
to the jump point, one jumps with them, and one meets the ships as they
drop out of jump, and escorts the cargo ships to the destination, along
with the other escort that jumped.  I STILL think that these could find a
nice niche to operate in, based on the premise that anything worth
defending will be well defended (and the YugoBoxes again, are probably
only transporting slag).

   What has that have to do with this discussion? UNLESS THE COMPUTER CAN
******UNDERSTAND******* THE BINARY CODE THE VIRUS IS WRITTEN IN, IT
****CANNOT**** EXECUTE THE VIRUS, PERIOD!!!

   A Virus is a computer program, it has EXACTLY the same limitations as
any other program, *EXACTLY*.

   Stop pouring gasoline on this thread, and start *listening* to what I\'m

  <sigh> That still doesn\'t explain how sensors can accept virii. In order
to enter, there has to be some way for code to be transferred from the
sensors to the CPU, and the CPU has to be told to execute this code. 
SENSORS DO NOT ACCEPT *****CODE***** THEREFOR THEY DO NOT ACCEPT VIRII. Is
that clear enough for you yet??

It\'s the ability (for better or worse, depending on RP ability) to play a
Captain Picard right out of the box.  Anagathics was probably the worst
thing to ever happen to character creation.

Three states isn\'t difficult to achieve.  Voltage levels would be one way 
(right now, it\'s hi-low; it could be hi-medium-low, or infinite 
variations), if you want to limit it to electronic computers.  Mechanical 
computers could do it, too, of course (a mechanical, three-position 
switch; gears would be easy, too).

You seem to be presuming that the data transmitted would include 
executable code.  That is, the receiving computer would have to execute 
that code of its own volition.  This isn\'t unreasonable (I had a BBS for 
quite a while, and the network software was updated via incoming network 
data...that is, the network connection programs came in with the regular 
messages, etc. and the programs were separated out from the data, then 
run), it just presumes lax security.  Who knows, maybe the Imperium was 
lax this way.

Yes, I know, the Virus is alive.  But the virus cannot execute without 
hardware.  Our conciousness, AFAIK, cannot execute without hardware 
either. :)  So, when the Virus is transmitted, it would not be alive 
until executed.  Thus, it could not take over the system until the system 
gave it a chance to by executing it.

Anyway, on second thought, who cares? :)  It\'s just a part of the game.  
Suspending my disbelief in the Virus won\'t hurt me.  Now that I have TNE, 
I can see that the Virus wouldn\'t be one of the things I would complain 
about if I had bought the game back when it came out (ie,before I knew T4 
was coming).

Easy answer: I dunno.  Three thousand years from now, maybe so.

Another answer:  Nah. All it would be able to see would be data, which 
wouldn\'t give it any clue to how the processor operates.

Dunno.  Throughout my experience with GDW, I\'ve had the distinct 
impression that they were experts in wargames, but not in computers.  
So, I tend to think they either didn\'t do much research into the virus 
(what is written in the book vis a vis today\'s virii is common 
knowledge), or made a concious decision to go with something that is, in 
present-day terms, difficult to believe.  But, again, we run into that 
3000 year time span.  Who knows what\'ll be possible then?

Enh, well, sort of: I\'m not sure that the average age of "death by old age
with only minor complications" has really increased since the biblical 70,
80 if you\'re tough.  All the reasons for dying earlier of something else
have been sort of pushed back, however.

Which is beside the point  -- you can posit anything, traveller having
Anagathics as the out.  I\'ve always suspected that T anagathics were
modelled of Booster Spice from Larry Niven\'s known spice: openly available,
but rare and awfully expensive.  Niven glances at some of the implication,
like Louis Wu\'s surprise at the risk implicit in Ringworld architecture and
contrasting it with human conservatism brought on by the prospect of extream
old age.  

Aside from the occasional 80 year old admiral, I\'ve never had to address it
in a campaign.

>Any thoughts on this?

Its got to have an effect on societies.  No matter what the cost, lots of
people are going to be bent out of shape by the existance of the stuff.  I
don\'t think T took this sufficiently into account.

On the death in generation thing:
Never used it -- never had the patience to re-roll some players character.
Always house-ruled around it.

Ah, okay.  Besides, I guess it wouldn\'t be that bad if a separate table 
was determined for each region on high population worlds (as you suggest 
in your trading system), so that no table would use more than four or 
five dice.

What about the Solomani?  As far as I remember, and this is from a long 
time back 10+ years, the Solomani were masters of genetic manipulation, 
far more sophisticated than the Imperium in this aspect.  If I remember 
this point right, could the Solomani effectively lengthen their life 
span far beyond the human norm.  Much like Anagath-B.

Well, then.  Its simple.  Virus proves Lamarckian theory (if you need an

Really?  I\'m not up on this stuff, obviously.  Still, one would hope 
that, in the Far Future (where virii can hop from one computer to 
another, maintaining conciousness without hardware to execute on, etc. 
etc.) life would be extended a bit more than that!  But, if that\'s the 
"planned obscelecence" built into the human machine, that\'s the way it

I started out using 200, but the players pointed out the Aging table and 
what it implies, so I dropped that.  (This was \'way back when, before I 
took control of my game from the rule books[G].)

This is a good question.  Let me look it up...  According to FF&S there 
is no difference, wonder why.  There\'s more internal structure and more 
material needed.  I guess it was decided that for the sake of simplicity 
they\'d just leave it the way it is.  I mean the external surface area 
would vary upon personal design astetics, wing configurations etc.

Generally speaking there\'s plenty of room on the outside of a ship for 
anything you want to put on there.

  Nope. A Virus is a computer program, doesn\'t matter if it\'s sentient or
not it\'s still just a computer program. Computer programs MUST be executed

  Explain how Virus takes control of a computer simply by "willing" it.

  I\'m sentient, yet I must still obey all the rules of computer
programming when operating a computer. I fail to see what sentience has to
do with this.

  Not enough. There are many cases in published material where Virus
simply invaded with no attempt to learn about the system, it is also
implied in many places that Virus became sentient only after mutating.

  Nope. See my discussion with Derek - sensors make absolutely NO sense as

  Define "directly". This still doesn\'t explain the ease of Virus taking
over communications and force feeding code into a foreign computer and
making that code execute. Security issues are well-understood now, why
would they be less so in the future?

  Then why couldn\'t Imperial expertise stop the Virus? The Imperium was

  Irrellevant. Grandfather "left" nothing behind for his "children" to
find, he seeded worlds period. Any tech left over was left by pure
accident.

  Yep, it\'s only a game. I\'ve let this go (well before I joined this

Because that opens the door to improvements (by the makers, third

Didn\'t some of the biblical characters (Adam & Eve, Noah, Methuselah) 
live much longer?  I thought the premise was that humans were constructed 
to live for a long, long time (some say forever), but the "fall from 
Eden" episode resulted in shorter and shorter life-spans.  But I digress...

We never did use anagathics.  It just never came up.  \'course, that could 
be because characters tended to die too soon to worry about it in my 
campaigns (not that I\'m a sadistic referee...the players just tended 
toward violent characters, and that eventually resulted in dead 
characters...ie, you can only be lucky for so long!:).

True.  Anagathics would be treated like psionics in reverse: everyone 
would want it, and would be insanely jealous of those who had access to 
the drug.

Which brings up something I\'ve been wondering for quite some time.  Is 
there any mention anywhere in all the materials for Traveller of how the 
Imperium makes money?  What sort of taxes do they levy?  I\'d imagine 
they\'d at least levy some sort of trade tax, since that\'s the activity 
they seem most interested in.  If so, then your reason #3 would be VERY 
important to them indeed.

My average in the campaign I\'m running now is about 40.  However, I do have
one annyoing player with a Grand Admiral with maybe every conceivable skill,
etc. and hordes of cash (thinking of getting rid of him).

In regard to Anagathics, I never even gave my players the option of getting
them during character generation, I just ignored it personally.

Definitelu.  My sentiments exactly.

I found the editing incredible after buying MegaTraveller.  However, taking
a look back through my CT Black Books, I can tell the difference.  The
editing in CT just far outweighs both TNE and MT.  I also hope IG aims for a
\'no-errors\' product.

I like the amount of characters, which then definitely lends itself to a
non-military campaign.  However, some of them I do find not useful at all
(ie. Athlete, etc.).  OThers though I hope are in a T4 supplement perhaps
(ie. Journalist, Civil Engineer).

It\'s okay I agree.  But my favourite generation system is the Advanced ones
for each MT career (Marine, Navy, Scout, Merchant)

I found it a lot easier to swallow than the massive MT list, but with more
options than the CT list.

Personally, I completely ignored that. Dexterity and agility, they\'re
synonyms so I didn\'t see the point, perhaps they wanted to be as far from
AD&D as possible?  Agreed on SOC, I didn\'t see the point of the \'-\' before it.

I could either do without it, or have a better, detailed text giving
adventure suggestions, personality types, possible\\example backgrounds, etc.

I like the card deck approach, especially if it\'s necessary on the spur of
the moment.  But, a table or two would have also been good.

Some comments, based on recent clarifications by Guy Garnett:

No need to list all the "00 Battery 0/0/0/0"\'s.  I\'m afraid I started this 
trend by listing them all in my own designs.  Guy pointed out that was 
unnecessary clutter.

Also, the fuel rating seems to be missing.

Well, the Vilani were known to "naturally" (prob thanks to the Ancients
and the lack of compatible pathogens on Vland) have long lifespans, noted
in "cannon" as being much longer than terran norms.

The Solomani certainly had a good handle on genetic engineering, but I
never saw any note on it used for longevity purposes.  That wouls be a
much higher tech level thing than cloning even, tinkering with our base
code as it were.

Solomani , maybe 100 years in a High Stellar setting.  Longer with
artificial organs, longer still with anagathics.

By *today\'s* standards, yes.  But what the hell is holographically-linked
controls?  And synaptic-linked computers?  You can\'t explain how things will
work 3,000 years from now with this kind of techno-babble based on today\'s
assumptions.

I would imagine it would have something to do with the fact that Virus occupies
a computer like we occupy 3D space.  You, yourself, are talking about
manipulating the goings-on inside a computer using an alpha-numeric keyboard and
little else.  *Your* consciousness is not imposed on that computer.

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you start talking like that, you\'ll have to explain everything else the
Traveller universe takes for granted.  Perhaps you\'d like to take a crack at
explaining Gravitics or Psionics using today\'s theories?  They\'ve  been
Traveller \'canon\' since day-one.  Perhaps Virus is minutely psionic?

Maybe it was already familiar with the system.

There\'s that word again!  Are you so sure?  I\'ve never read anything published
that states this fact.

As I posted a few days ago...

"This type of arguement can be used to explain almost everything in the
Traveller universe.  It is only when this information falls within someone\'s
area of expertise when things start to fall apart (you obviously know a great
deal about computers).

"At first, Virus infiltrated and destroyed the computer systems at the Imperial
core.  It did this relatively easily since it was, in fact, created inside a
computer on a research station belonging to Lucan\'s faction.  At this point,
Virus could use information in surviving Imperial computers (that discussed how
the computers of its neighbours functioned) to modify itself to infiltrate and
take over those systems.  Virus might have even built prototypes of these
computers for testing.  Virus\' intelligence would have been off the scale... who
knows what it was capable of conceaving.

"Perhaps some of these vessels surrendered to the Vargr, Aslan, Hivers, K\'kree,
etc. allowing them to download Virus and begin the spread throughout each race\'s
region of space.  Multiple attempts might have had to have been made, but by
simply surrendering (instead of trying to force-feed Virus into the enemy\'s
computers), these attempts might have gone more-or-less unnoticed.  All it would
take is one or two greedy corsair captains (who would be more than happy to lay
claim to a drifting derelict)."

Well, I\'ll get the fuel rating, and post the corrected design.  Perhaps my

I\'ll get the corrected version done in a minute.

The Bulk Freight Carrier is a monstrous beast of a ship. 
It is meant for long-haul large shipments, and it similar
to the large supercarriers of late 20th century Terra.

The ship\'s crew complement of 15 is comprised of: 5
Engineers, 2 Electronics, 2 Manuver, 4 Gunners, 2 Command. 
There is a bridge, in which the workstations for everyone
but Engineers reside.  The Captain has a large stateroom,
and his Executive officer has a small stateroom.  The rest
of the crew are relegated to bunks.

The ship is meant for long haul expeditions, and taking into account it\'s
extremely slow jump drive, it is meant for journeys which take a long
time as well.

Note:  The price of the ship takes into account the 25%
discount on QSDS designs
       The fuel consumption for the power plant (the only thing that needs
fuel on the whole ship) is 10.7\\year.  Therefore, I figure 144\\10.7 = 13.45
which is almost 14 years of operating without refueling!

Comments are welcome!

The Sylean Med. Warship is a small vessel meant to be use din convoys.
However, despite it\'s size, it is packed with weapons onto an unstreamlined
Spherical hull.

The crew work on a bridge (except engineers) and the Captain sleeps in a
large stateroom.  THe rest of the crew sleep in bunks. 

The fuel carried is enough to last the ship 2.5 years without refueling
(20\\8.1 = 2.45).

Comments are welcome!

    'body' => 'Yeah, I know.  It\'s too late to influence the main T4 book.  

When I was younger, I\'d sit and dream and hope what my Christmas presents 
would be, even after they were under the tree (okay, I still do 
this...grin).  It was too late for my wishes to have any influence, but I 
still spent time wishing.  I find myself doing the same thing in regards 
to T4, especially now that I have TNE as an additional source of ideas.

Here\'s a wish list for T4, including only those things I don\'t know about it:

1)  I hope the systems are easy to use.  I love complexity, but I love 
have a choice more.  The main system (ie, the T4 book) should be as 
simple as possible.  Complexity can come later.
	The TNE and MT task systems are too complex.  They both start out 
with simple premises, then add on gobs of extras.  Something simple like 
using a different number of dice, or better yet different dice (ie, D4, 
D6, D10, etc.) to reflect difficulty would be nice, instead of requiring 
additional calculatons.   Figuring out the base difficulty then 
multiplying by the difficulty factor isn\'t necessary.  Here\'s an example 
of how my system might work:
	You need to do a task...say, firing a pistol.  Dexterity is your 
controlling characteristic, and you have a dex of 8.  You have Pistol-2, 
so you add that in, giving you a total of 10.  You roll 2D6 for routine 
tasks (with 12 as an automatic failure), 3D6 for difficult tasks, and 4D6 
for formidable tasks.  Or, 1D6, 1D12, and 1D20.  Or whatever.  Highest 
roll possible is always failure.   Otherwise any roll less than or equal 
to the required is a success, others are failures.  If you want to add in 
mishaps (or consider dangerous tasks/catastrophic failures), then add a 
second roll on failure.  If failure occurs again, then it was 
catastrophic or a mishap or whatever.  With uncertain tasks, have the GM 
roll as well (like with the DGP/MT task system), in secret.
	Personally, I wouldn\'t even bother with mishaps/catastrophic 
failures, and I would make all tasks uncertain by having the GM do the 
rolling (if it is uncertain, the GM can give whatever information is 
appropriate to the player, otherwise reveal the result directly).  Keep 
it simple.

2)  Once again, I hope the editing is top-notch.  Doesn\'t have to be 
perfect, but keep the errata down to 1/4 page per 100 pages.

3)  The world building data in TNE (derived from World Builder\'s 
Handbook, which was derived from Grand Survey and Grand Census) is 
great.  Again, the basic book should keep everything simple, but I\'d like 
to see this topic revisited in this much detail in a supplement for T4.

4)  I hope the player\'s info (character generation, skills, combat, 
starships, equipment, starship economics, starship combat, etc.), the 
referee\'s info (world building, animal encounters, how to be a referee, 
etc.), and the setting (what is the Imperium, the history, an 
introductory adventure or three, etc.) are kept separate in the book.  Three 
distinct sections.

5)  I hope they provide lots of forms.  I love that about Traveller.

6)  I hope the tables (and forms!) are kept at the end of each section, 
rather than being intersperced with the text where space is available.  
It\'s nice to have the Aging table next to the text on Aging, but it seems 
it never works out where that happens with all tables.  They end up 
putting table X three pages after the text about it, due to the large 
number of tables in the section.  So, put \'em all in the back of the 
section they are treated in.


That\'s enough for now, eh? :)

   By *any* standards - that\'s what an operating system *is*. 

   If you want to assume that computer security is nil (against all logic)
you go right ahead, myself I\'ll do what makes sense.

   Holographic linked controls use 3D representations and
fully-programmable control representations to improve the human machine
(ergonomic) factor, and thus improve the efficiency of the interface.

   Synaptic linked take that one step further with a direct neural
connection.

  Again, irrelevant.
 
  What has the rest of the Traveller universe have to do with Virus? My
*only* objection to Virus is how it defies logic, and makes it impossible
to suspend disbelief, a factor *critical* to the success of an s/f story
or game.

  The other stuff, despite problems, are much easier to swallow than
Virus.

  I might add that Virus would be MUCH more believable if they\'d just do
one simple thing - ADD QUALIFIERS. The hardest thing to swallow about
Virus is the fact that they assume that ALL computers - from the TL7 IBM
360 all the way up to the AI TL15 Imperial mainframe - are vulnerable to
it. Bullsh!t.

  If they said "All IMPERIAL computers" or "All TL-15 computers" then I\'d
go for it, but the lack of qualifications (along with a lot of plainly
nonsensical stuff like sensors being vectors) makes Virus a joke. 

  As someone else said, it can be mathematically PROVEN that some
computers are IMMUNE to viral infection.

   ...which is why I\'ve decided to Take Mercy on the innocent and stop
this thread before it get\'s any warmer. I\'m seeing red, and I\'m not in any
shape to pursue a rational discussion right now.

   If the rest of you want to continue without me go ahead, I said
everything that matters and I\'d just be repeating myself from now on
anyways. So if the testosterone-challenged types need to get the last word
in, here\'s your chance.

   Have a nice one!

No, I\'m not right!  It is possible.  And if you think it isn\'t, then . . .

Oops. Got caught up in the argument for a minute there. :)

I happen to know from personal experience that all of these things are 
possible.  The aliens that abducted me last night showed me how, right 
before they flew to a wheat field and drew a design in the crop.

And the card deck stuck with another aspect of CT: all materials were 
things you\'d commonly have around the house.  No weird dice, just the 
six-siders most people have and which are available at any drugstore, 
home-made counters suggested for use rather than an emphasis on figures, 
etc.

I don\'t recall seeing anything about that in the rules..can\'t remember
anything from the journals either..humm.  Personally, I figured the
Imperium took a cut out of every transaction that went through a
starport.  There was a Imperial agent at every starport, just to make
sure the Emperor got his piece, the Duke got his, the Baron got
his...and maybe a little extra for the agent.  <g>

I agree.  Personally speaking, the reason I play Traveller (and various
other RPGs for that matter) is FICTION.  I personally find nothing
intriguing about an RPG based on Wall Street, for instance.  The whole
point of an RPG, IMHO, is to provide opportunities that can NOT be
presented in any way in real life.  In effect, I play Traveller as an
interactive SF novel (how many times have you gotten to the end of a
Heinlein, Cherryh, Gibson, what have you, novel and played out what
happens after the novel ends?  I do it quite a lot.).

While discussing the feasibility of game concepts in real life terms can
provide interesting insights into how to better incorporate it into the
game, one must remember that we are essentially battering around two
different (and in the end, usually unreconcileable, if the amount of
messages I\'ve gotten on these thread is any indication) concepts----those
of (quasi-literary) PLOT DEVICES within the Traveller universe, and actual
concepts in real 1996 life.

Don\'t get me wrong.  I love arguement just for the sake of argument, but I
think we (myself included) need to keep in mind what we are arguing about:
a fictional game.  So.  My plea is that we keep argueing over all this
stuff, but remember that we are discussing how the elements of the
Traveller universe work, which are necessarily divergent from the
technology we have presently.  Just the gulf of time between the \'now\' and
the \'then\' sufficiently isolates Traveller.

Traveller is a construction of _a future_ that has developed over the past
couple of decades.  Perhaps we should frame our arguements about how Virus
developed through this wealth of information, and recognize that, as
another list-member already pointed out, things can change a lot in 3000
years.

Up to making challenges and not accepting them?  These two examples were both
firmly rooted in the Traveller universe long before Virus ever was introduced.

And why is that?  It is because you are highly computer-literate.  Psioncs defy
current logic, as does gravitic technology, but they don\'t seem to bother you in
the least (I won\'t even ask about reactionless thrusters).  Please don\'t
consider me wrong in *my* opinion just because you have privy to certain
information that makes your acceptance of Virus impossible.  Its just a game.
S/F will rely on techno-babble for many years to come.  Do I claim that
Terminator or T2 were bad movies because they rely heavily on unproven (ie:
without *any* scientific basis, period) theories regarding time travel?  All I
(and a few others) have been trying to do is present certain viewpoints that
might make Virus easier to swallow (groan).  This isn\'t Jyhad.  Please don\'t try
and take it upon yourself to try and dissuade others from using Virus in their
campaigns because "you know better".

Well, okay, I\'m convinced -- Virus couldn\'t work.  No possible amount of

     "The Maginot Line is impenetrable."
     "If Man were meant to fly, he\'d have wings."
...and...
     "The world, around which the universe revolves, is flat."

What I find so patently ridiculous is these people carrying on like 
DISbelieving something is some great intellectual achievement.  I mean, 
so what?  I had just as hard a time swallowing the Virus thingy as anyone 
else, but I\'ve still managed to include it in my Traveller campaign 
without laying awake at night wondering if it\'s far too "over the top" 
for a proper setting.  I mean, if you think that the concept of a 
machine-based sentience that can move through computing systems like a

Im sorry, but you are incorect.

The Virus was a scentient creature derived from a lifeformed that evolved 
in the Solomani Rim (Cimbarii [sp??]??). It was a walking computer chip, 
able to manipulate 
electrons and cirturty not unlike the way we use food and nural impulses. 
It was able to replicate by passing its "genetic makeup" through radio 
signals (which the Imperium made very easy by forcing all ships that 
enter its space to have the protovirus lifeform in all of their 
transponders.)

It is like the fact that you can walk into a room and change the way it 
looks by changing the furniture and painting the walls. It could 
manipulate its enviroment. It was as much a computer code as you and I am.

What stinked was that starships that use to have 1 TL7 computer now have

would the state of robotics in Year 0.

We did know they excisted, given that CT Book 8 listed the history of 
robotics  back to before Year 0. What I want to know is what is the social 
climate for robots.

In order to show how, I will make a few definitions:

1. The average TL11 person  has more computing power in a watch than NORAD 
and NASA together today. His "computers" would be so powerful that it would 
give Bill Gates nightmares, sharing data and instructions over a whole 
planetary net.

2. Power is everywhere. From Mr Fusion (tm) to radio signals, to power grids 
in every road and floor, to thermal power and solar power.

Now, to take advantage of this, I design a TL11 robot. I want it to handle 
complex instructions, and perform large and intrictate stuff, like build a 
home or make a tunnel. I could put a Mr Fusion plant and large complex 
copmuter in it. But why do i need to? All I need to do is put an equivelent 
of a Network Computer, able to take large amout of data 
(visiual,tactile,sensor,audio,direct data feed) and send it to a computer 
dedicated to process data for robots. (Companies may set themselves up 
toprovide this as a service, like ISP today, or you can have a central 
computer for your own copreations robots, or even your personal comp which 
has processing space spare). I do not need power, as I can draw more than 
enough from the local power grid, even if it was 2km away (for longer 
distances I may need a radio booster and fusion pack, but for the example 
this robot stays in areas serviced by the computer and power nets).

So , all i need is a small power converter, a relatively small computer and 
a chasie. I then add what i deed, servo\'s for movement and manipulation, 
sensors, output devices and whatever tools i need (plasma torches, earth 
moving equipment, drills, whatever).

So , In a normal TL11 enviromets, robots are a real cheap proposition, low 
cost to build, great value for money, extreamly veritile, easy to program 
(all you need is a HTML like hook > I need to do this...get the insrtuctions 
from here...do task).

It would also make a design sequence laughingly simple. basic computer, 
servoes, power box, and add what we need on it.

device but he quibbles on two points :-

1. How can the Virus use sensors to transmit itself

2. How can alien computers be affected

For 1, I think that FF&S mentions that passive EMS can be used to receive
radio in an emergency so I guess the arrays computer has emergency software
to act as a radio receiver, thats all the virus need.  As for 2 I agree,
only trader and liners for use in the Imperium should effected and most of
the damage probably from Virus ships wandering in.  The PoT seems to suggest
the Hivers are relatively unharmed.  There should be mostly intact Aslan and
K\'Kree nations out there.  Any handwaving as to why there haven\'t contacted

Um, no, not for me at least. Who says that sensors don\'t accept code?
Nortel is planning a new phone set that will be dynamically 
reconfigurable by having it able to accept Java code d/loaded over the 
phone line. There\'s a LCD display attatched, so it can be programmed
to let you pay bills, buy tickets for sporting events, etc.

So, if phones can do it, why not sensors?

If we follow the current trends in computing, we should see CPUs 
embedded in everything and the distinction between code and data
will break down - code will be transmitted to dynamically
change the behaviour of devices, etc.

For instance, in CT you can have Auto-Gunnery (what was that
program called?) 1 all the way to 6. I don\'t imagine
that the gunnery station would be totally dumb, accepting 
control commands from a big mainframe (which is basically
how they describe it in CT, but), instead the main computer
would d/load a new gunnery program to the turret.

This has several advantages, including greater autonomy, 
and redundancy - if you main computer gets knocked out,
you can keep fighting.

Anyways, I feel silly doing all thsi justifying as other
people have presented the real rebuttal to this argument -
it\'s fiction, it\'s a game and it\'s set 3000+ years from now,
how can we disprove anything the game creators come up with?

Definitely, although that didn\'t bother me personally.  A few AD&D

Right, definitely.  I think the complexity of the MT system was way too much
at first for a novie Traveller player like myself.  THe first few times I
rana  game, it took ten minutes for the players to look at a computer :)

Different dice is a good idea, and it\'s at least something people expect in
an RPG nowadays.  There\'s not many of them that only use d6 like the CT
system did.

I personally ignored mishaps\\catastrophic failures as they slowed down the
gaming process too much.  Perhaps they could be added in as an optional
rule, but I know I still wouldn\'t use \'em.

I\'d like to see it down to the level of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game Rule
Book.  As far as I know there\'s only two errors in the entire thing, both in
the stats for one class.

Well, since the worldbuilding data in TNE is basically the same as MT, I
like it, especially in it\'s corrected form.  However, what I\'d like to see
is more of an explanation of some of the terms.  I personally know what all
the different stellar classes, etc. mean, but it is confusing at first to
decide what type of star, luminosity class, etc. to put in your system.

Right, that should satisfy everyone on the list too.  THose that want
Imperium can read it, those that don\'t, well, it\'s at the end of the book,
so, ignore it.

I\'d like to see the forms in a pullout section at the end of the book for

The tables are good, though I think they should be kept with the section
they\'re about so that said section can have better explanation of the terms
used in each table.

     I noticed that the J1 & J2 versions carried the same cargo.  Shouldn\'t

     The PP rating seemed a bit low.  Do your ships have the correct power 
     rating for the manouvre drives (1MW/kl, not 1MW/ton) from QSDS 1.2?
     The Manouvre Rating seems a bit low for a warship at 2G.  I guess this 
     doesn\'t matter as much, since you say its mission is as an escort (for

     Crossposting:
     I\'ve created a 5000t tanker using QSDS 1.2 (with the Big Hull

     I\'ve been sending my designs to Guy Garnett and they should appear

     Lifespan:
     I think someone has already mentioned this, but max lifespan hasn\'t 
     altered by a great deal through history.  *Average* lifespan has 
     increased, (I think) mainly due to reduced infant mortality.  And by 
     the time you\'re 80, most people are riddled with cancer (although 
     that\'s not necessarily what they die from).  The people that last to 
     110+ have usually been found not to have any cancerous growths, which, 
     as I said, is very unusual for that age.  I guess Traveller era 
     medicine must have figured out how to slow down cancer for anagathics 
     to work.

Hm, there are already languages that do not have any distinction
between code and data. Some years ago I was involved in writing
some expert systems in PROLOG, which originated as a logic
programming language. It is interpreted, and can \'assert\' or
\'retract\' new logical clauses as it operates. It doesn\'t care
whether they are code or data, and can use the same line of
code as either, if it wishes. It also doesn\'t care what order
the instructions appear in the program file...

Anyway, 3000 years+ from now, who knows? I must admit, coming
from a computing background, I didn\'t feel comfortable with
the idea of the Virus. As I didn\'t feel comfortable with it,
I felt that I could not represent it accurately to my players,
therefore I didn\'t use it...but I probably did use other ideas
that other disciplines would have felt uncomfortable with. As
long as no-one in your group is unhappy with it, thats what counts
isn\'t it?

	Well....I don\'t know if I\'d say it was "improved" (except, I\'ve 
heard it is better edited), it\'s just related....derived from.  It\'s 
pretty much the same old stuff as DGP put out for CT and MT, but edited 
differently.

debates currently raging (with varying levels of civility) on this
otherwise excellent list:

Whether the issue be orbital bombardment, computers/sensors and the virii
who love them or just about any other technical subject, people are getting
_very_ hot under the collar.  While everyone brings their own, valuable,
experience and insight to a discussion, one major point seems to have been
overlooked, and the "experts" are _at least_ as guilty of this as the
laymen:

We are dealing with (fictional) 50th-century technology.  Not only does
this make possible things we can only imagine at present, it (in many
cases) likely makes things we _cannot_ imagine commonplace.  While that\'d
be awfully hard to reproduce in a game that is, after all, a work of the
imagination, please consider the \'advances\' mankind has made in just about
every field of understanding over the course of the last thirty centuries. 
We have essentially completely rewritten every field of scientific
endeavour, in the process invalidating much or all previous thoughts on the
subject. It is likely that another such period will do the same. 
Furthermore, when you consider the snowballing of technological advancement
in recent decades and postulate a similar rate of advancement (for even a
significant fraction of the time frame involved), and it is evident that
making claims based on current thinking (in _any_ field) is pretty useless.

At the same time, we have nothing but our knowledge and experience (such as
it is) to base our opinions on, so it is understandable, even necessary
that we do so.  Much of the game\'s appeal lies in the fact that it has
traditionally had the \'hardest\' science of any sci-fi game I am aware of,
and so applying our present knowledge (and attendant assumptions) is all
too easy.  Yet, having said this, it is inherently fallacious to do so to
the exclusion of other explanations.  We accept Jump Drives, do we not?  We
do so because our current understanding of the laws of Physics provides no
\'feasible\' alternative, and without it the game (as it stands) would be
unplayable.

Please consider this same suspension of disbelief (or at least tolerance of
it in others) the next time you get the urge to flame someone, or defend a
point of view unto death in the name of \'science\'.

I think the above is the key.  I know the physicist\'s among us have a
serious problem with the reactionless thrusters.  I would guess the
psychologist\'s among us (and others who study human nature) find the idea
that Psionics can be supressed (with human curiosity what it is) somewhat
difficult.  The Economists and Financeurs among us (myself included) have
trouble reconciling the Imperial government structure and such with the
existing trade practices in the Imperium.  The folks who study FTL potential
(sorry, I don\'t know what you guys are called) find the Jump drive theory
crazy.  The military and ex-military among us find the combat rules obscene.
The major difference is that in every other incarnation of traveller, all of
the above ideas and technology (reactionless Thrusters, Psionics, Economic
rules, Jump Drive, and Combat Rules) are all included.  The folks who are
specialists in these other areas have to deal with the same difficulties the
Computer Specialists are forced to deal with concerning Virus.  The
difference is that the folks in the other fields can\'t just toss out the
version that includes the part of the background or rules that disagrees
with currently known technology because they exist in all previous versions.

Let\'s see if we can summarize the arguements:

  ANTI-VIRUS SIDE - Virus is just a program that must be executed before it
can even begin to take control of a computer system.  The computer systems
within the Imperium (possibly) and without the Imperium (definitely) will be
different and Virus could not easily transfer itself to another system.  The
idea that Virus can be transported through sensors and communications and
(possibly) even transponders which are just data is ludicrous.

  PRO-VIRUS SIDE -  Two things must be taken into consideration as the basis
for considering Virus.  1. Virus is alive and makes its own choices, and
therefore doesn\'t need to be activated to begin to take control of a
computer.  It can activate itself.  2. We are discussing computers that are
so far ahead of our technology that we can\'t even begin to comprehend how or
even why they work much less how a virus will interact with them.

  FINAL POINT - One other point needs to be considered, and that is that the
Transponders required by the Imperium to be on any ship that travelled
within its borders were small boxes that contained the Virus "chips."  These
systems were required to be intergrated with the computer systems on board
the ship.  This "Transponder suite" is supposed to have been the main access
point of the Virus.

********

OK, those of you on the ANTI-VIRUS SIDE, Let me know if I\'m understanding
your point correctly.  If not let me know how to change what I\'ve said to
better reflect your basic arguements.  Also if you can admit to
understanding but not agreeing with the PRO-VIRUS SIDE and the FINAL POINT,
I\'d appreciate it.  (I\'m not asking you to accept the PRO-VIRUS arguements,
just admit that you understand that that is what the PRO-VIRUS SIDE is
saying and you just don\'t think it is relevant or accurate or whatever.)
(Larry, I\'m asking for your input here too.  I know you were going to drop
the debate, but this isn\'t a debate just a final position statement.  PS -
Everyone else - Larry\'s response to this isn\'t a reflection of his going
back on what he said previously, he will just be doing what I have asked him
to do!!)

PRO-VIRUS SIDE, we need to do the same thing.  That is we need to look at
the summary above and see if it accurately relfects our arguements and look
at the ANTI-VIRUS SIDE\'s arguements and admit that we understand what they
are saying, but don\'t necessarily agree with it.  Also please comment on the
FINAL POINT if you feel it is inaccurate or needs clarification.

If we can all do this, we might just be able to put this thing to rest and
put this in the "Done to Death" section of the TML/XTML FAQ.

Thank you for your support!  :)

  For the record, I don\'t use Psionics in my campaign. Gravitics is
another story, but it\'s so damned useful - and makes a LOT more sense than
Viruses that can infect through sensors. 

  I know I said I wouldn\'t follow up any more, but here\'s a thought for
you:

  Can you catch AIDs throught he telephone? Do you really think TL-15
telephones will make any difference in this? Virus infecting through
sensors is EXACTLY this silly.

   There are a lot of possiblities. One could run a campaign where the RC
are the Heavies, and have the PCs trying to survive in the Wilds with the
RC being the occasional opposition. The biggest problem here is the lack
of a good economic model. You could also use the RC source material to
place the party on a world in the Wilds that is recovering from the
Collapse and starting civilization, and send them out in an exploration
vessel. You could set the party up as Imperial citizens coming out of
low-sleep after their ship got infected by Virus and introducing them to
the Collapse and get a feel for the party with a "what now?" scenario...

Actually, the maximum life span hasn\'t really changed that much.  The
_average_ life span has been increasing, as few people die of diseases and
accidents.  Also, quality-of-life has increased for the elderly.  But there
is evidence that we are approaching a \'built-in\' limit.  (Of course, limits
can be broken, which is what anagathics do.)

Statistics are tricky things.  There is a country in Africa where the average
lifespan is 15.  If you survive your first two years, though, you will
probably life to be 60 -- they just have a horrendous childhood mortality
rate.  (War, protein starvation, famine, endemic diseases...)

Check out the Internet Worm.  Message data got executed as code by exploiting
a hole in the sendmail software.

You may feel that this would be fixed in the future.  Having worked in the
telecom business, and seen the security holes left unfixed because (a)
"letting one would destroy customer confidence", or (b) "we can\'t afford to

processors, and the like -- I don\'t really care.  But I can well believe that

Simple.  Get some 0.25 inch graph paper.  Using a scale of 1 metre = 2
squares, you now have straight lines every half metre.  Draw your deck plan
on this paper, using these lines to keep things straight.  When finished,
either darken every fourth line, or place small crosses (your choice).

Make corridors 1 metre (1/5 inch) wide - give the extra space to neighbouring
areas like staterooms.

This technique (which is what I used back when Traveller was first published)
works nicely.  Of course, you do get fairly large deck plans - but I feel the
extra detail makes up for the difference.

To check out some similar plans for Space 1889, look at:

 www.heliograph.com/space1889.html

(Actually, the plans may not be there for a couple of days, so be patient.) 
This will show you full-colour 25mm deck plans, complete with interior
furnishings (down to the papers on the captain\'s desk).

The essentials of the Anti-Virus side are there, and I understand the

Would you accept a proof by counterexample?

As a teacher, I routinely \'program\' biological computers through their
sensors.  I teach kids.  I have no direct access to their brains, but I can
instill (when successful) new observable behaviour patterns.

In fact, according to neuro-linguistic programming theory (supported by some
new work in neural anatomy), your brain \'extends\' out into your body, and
thus its functioning can be directly affected by manipulating sensory input. 
Classic demonstration case is eye position/memory recall.

Now, if you believe that the TL15 computers are essentially high-end PCs,
this is all silly.

Personally, I believe that they have \'crossed the line\' into the realms of
biological complexity.  Programers do not \'write code\' so much as manipulate
genetic markers, train neural algorithms, and do other things that haven\'t
been invented yet.  This strains my imagination no more than believing in
gravitics modules that can warp space, jump drive that has limits based on
diameter (and not mass or gravitational gradient), starships that should be
glowing cherry red from heat production (but aren\'t), and many other parts of
the Traveller universe.

I remember someone claiming that genetic algorithms were neat toys but would
never amount to anything commercially.  At the time this individual made the
claim, several Canadian pipelines were using control software created by a
genetic algorithm.  What made tha matter amusing (or sad, dependingon your
viewpoint) was that the individual making the \'this is incredibly silly\'
claim was a computer science student at Waterloo, so should have known
better.

I ran my TNE campaign as a grand-n-gritty adventure to rebuild.  Although
many of the published adventures were raids, it was stated that these were
not nearly as common as diplomatic missions.  So I used that statement.

First-entry missions were covert insertions to gather intelligence. 

Follow-up adventure was a planning session to determine the best action. 
Which was usually...

Third adventure was a diplomatic/trade/aid mission to contact locals, help
them, and win their allegiance.

Against this, there was a backdrop of power politics within the RC.  Plenty
of hooks left there for a political game.  If you don\'t like the neo-colonial
attitude of the RC, run a campaign where the RC is the bad guys, and the
players are working within the system to change it.

Well, why else would you need telephone sanitizers?

Back when I worked at Northern Telecom (now Nortel), someone posted a press
release from one of the American states, about how the Governor had mandated
disposable telehone sanitary cover be placed in all public phone booths.  We
thought it was a practical joke, but apparently he was serious...!

One of the current concerns at Nortel is how secure Java is.  Remember the
new Nortel phone mentioned earlier?  What if someone could reprogram it to
pay your money into their account?  (After all, it can be remotely programmed
to pay your bills.)  Sun claims Java is secure, but two serious bugs have
already been discovered (and admittedly corrected) - what if one is disovered
_after_ the phones are being sold?  This is the stuff of corporate
nightmares...

Oh, you mean the YugoBox class of derelicts.  Sorry, but there is no  
such thing as space protected that well in the Imperium.  Piracy was  
and would be a continuous problem everywhere within the Imperium,  
even at the core.  Or did you think the Imperium stationed all those  
SDB\'s & Gazelle Close Escorts in Core sector for military parades?   
As a pirate, I\'d be licking my chops to puncture the hull into a few  
of these ships.  Be easier than stealing candy from a baby... 
- ---- 
 
<Dragoness rubs her hands together in anticipation> Oh, boy!  You\'ve 
just given me an excuse to restart "TML Thread that Never Dies" #3: "The 
Economics of Piracy".  Steve & I used to argue this one all the time... 
 
Precis: 
Away from the borders, interstellar piracy is impractical, uneconomic, 
and impossibly risky--It Just Ain\'t Gonna Happen.  It\'s about as 
feasible as pirating Mississippi River barges with armed gunboats.  
 
Quick Summary of the main points: 
 
(1) Pirate ships require a base.  No world within the Imperium will 
knowingly support pirates, because doing so means a Impy Navy CruRon 
brings a regiment of Imperial Marines to change your government for you.  
In fact, they\'ll do that to worlds *outside* the Imperium (Tarkine being 
the classic example).  So, a pirate base must be: 
     (a) outside the Imperium, on a world secure from Imperial attack. 
It has to be close enough to the Imperium for the pirate ships to be 
able to reach those rich targets inside the Imperium.  This does work, 
to a limited extent.  It\'s one of the reasons why merchant ships in the 
Spinward Marches, Reaver\'s Deep, and other border sectors tend to go 
armed.  Of course, pirate bases outside the Imperium provide the 
Imperial Navy character generation track with that exciting event: Raid. 
In my campaign, a lot of those non-wartime "raids" were punitive raids 
against corsair bases in the Vargr Extents.  Of course, your pirate base 
could be protected by a world that the Imperium doesn\'t dare raid 
without starting a major war, like the Sword Worlds or the Zhodani 
worlds.  In that case, if you are acting with the collusion of an 
interstellar government, you aren\'t a pirate, you\'re a commerce raider 
and/or privateer, and there\'s a state of limited space war going on. 
     (b) Or, the base could be hidden inside the Imperium.  This might 
work, but it doesn\'t take too much intelligence work to trace shipments 
of things like spare parts for starships, heavy machinery for repair 
yards, trained technicians, etc.  Room for an adventure, though.  Sooner 
or later, the base will be found, if it is within the Imperium, where 
Imperial Navy AND system squadrons have free rein to patrol and 
investigate. 
 
(2) Yes, space can be protected that well deep inside the Imperium.  
Everytime we\'ve played a campaign game of TCS, we\'ve been struck by how 
many thousands of fast, heavily armed, utterly deadly Fighters even a 
Pop 8 world can produce as a small part of the total military budget.  
And for a Hi-Pop world, enough fighters and fighter carriers to blanket 
every system in the same subsector is mere pocket change.   
     For hunting pirates down, you need a jump drive; for patrolling 
and defending a system against the small vessels usually used by 
pirates, there\'s nothing as effective as a well-designed long-range 
fighter.  BTW, the classic SDB is a long-range fighter on steroids; 
check out the performance.  Small (thus cheap), no jump drive, as heavy 
a suite of weapons as you can stuff in it, accomodations for long 
patrols, and pulls lots of Gs.  I always preferred a 50-75 ton heavy 
fighter myself; cheaper yet, build faster, better DefMod, but you get 
the idea. 
 
(3) I don\'t approve of completely unarmed ships. Put one tiny laser or 
missile launcher on them; that makes it uneconomical for piracy.  (Hint: 
compare the cost of repairing the pirate ships J-drive, M-drive or other 
vital systems vs. the salvage from the wrecked merchant ship and its 
cargo).  But, you can get away with it if you stick to heavily patrolled 
systems (like those on major trade routes). 
- ---- 
 
You said: 
 
Nice design, but I didn\'t even necessarily buy into the unarmed XBoat  
concept...let alone stepping on board an unarmed Merchant. 
 
The Liberty ship comparison isn\'t all that good either.  WW2  
Merchant ships were almost routinely armed with a deckgun, and there  
are accounts of merchant ships sinking or damaging U-Boats (the 20th 
century equivalent of the corsair). 
- ---- 
But modern freighters aren\'t.  How many deck guns have you seen on 
supertankers?

   I\'m saying that TNE assumes *all* races were threatened by Virus, yet 
logically this makes no sense.  
 
   To try to make this more clear, let\'s compare US and Russian computer 
design. The American computers and Russian computers have *totally* 
different form factors, and even less compatible architectural 
differences. This is from two different societies on Earth at more-or-less 
the same tech-level (Traveller scale).

A minor nitpick, but I understood that Russian computers were almost all 
rip-offs of American designs, and thus "miraculously" similar.  There\'s a 
well-known Russian mainframe that is a clone of the old IBM 360, for 
example...

  If after reading this, you still don\'t get the point, then I challenge 
you to write a Virus that can infect *both* my \'486 PC, running OS/2 and a

any clues to it\'s existence prior to infection, and is unremovable without

technically competent and persistant; Virus is all three.   
 
And if TL 10+ hardware is designed to dynamically reconfigure itself, 
(something that is almost doable now with PALs and PLAs), you could get an 
infection that can\'t be removed without destroying the "brains" of the

"Josie and the Pussycats".

No, there are no Aslan involved (see possible exception below).  For those
too young to remember this show, it was based around a terran "girl group"
of rock musicians, led by Josie, which when touring a spaceship of the
latest design one member of the group, Melody, accidentially hits a lever
launching them into space and subsequent wild adventures.

The problem is I can\'t remember any of the adventures from the original.
All will be roleplaying adventures (they\'re a girl group!  what do they
know about guns!) which probably end with the band playing a great rock
tune and making everyone happy.

Possibly, one of the players will insist on playing the Aslan bodyguard
(at which point it will become the "Josies and the Pussycat" Adventure).
Something I oppose only mildly, since the possibility of the completely
(almost) non-technical band being matched up with a by nature
non-technical Male Aslan has its own possibilities.

Ok, so here\'s the setting;

Josie and her band, "The Pussycats" accidently launch and misjump a TL16
100-200 ton (merchant?) vessel.  Obviously this experimental vessel has a
hih degree of automation, but being experimental it is also quite
tempermental.  They can\'t get it to reverse its course and end up
exploring planets (Sword Worlds area?) at the whim of the computer (and
the GM) making friends and playing gigs, and getting into all sorts of
trouble.

The following characters are present;

Josie : The leader of the group and just about the only one who can keep
her head in a crisis.  Skills; Performance (musical instrument) 4,
Leadership 1, Nothing else important.

Melody : The drummer.  Her amazing ability to do exactly the wrong
thing at exactly the wrong time is what caused the group to end up in
outer space in the first place.  At any given time, when she attempts a
task she has a 1 in 6 chance of doing exactly the opposite of what she was
supposed to do.  Skills; Performance (Musical Instrument) 3.

Valarie : The bass player and techie.  The only one other
than Josie who isn\'t flighty (at least not all the time) .  Also the only
one who can fix anything.  She has what equates to a Jack-of-all-trades in
electronic, computer and mechanical items.  To me this means she has about
a 1-in-6 shot (once) at fixing whatever is wrong with the ship, after
which she will identify a part or ability which the group needs to find
(wherever they happen to be) to fix it "So we can finally get home!".
Significantly, Valerie was the only Hanna-Barbera African-American
character I can remember (aside from Uhura on the Star Trek cartoon).

There are two other Pussycats who arent as memorable - anyone remember
this strange and entertaining show?  I looked for a "Josie" web site, but
suprisingly, alta vista failied to find one (I thought it might be just
culty enough...).

Any suggestions welcomed - especially if they come by email (traffic
yaknow).

Well, I looked at the FFSlight document and did some back-of-the-napkin
calculations. It looks like I got what I asked for (and you didn\'t even
need the "zeta field" :). Specifically, with HEPlaR, a non-military ship
can hope at best for a maximum delta-V of around 2500 km/s. This is very
high, but not quite a planet-killer. Given that energy increases with
the square of velocity and at 5 km/s a meteor has the KE of its mass in
TNT, this yields a KE of 0.25 megatons * the ship\'s total tonnage. Thus,
a 200 ton ship could hit like a 50 megaton bomb. Most importantly,
planetary defenses could still deal with ships at those speeds.

Fusion rockets are less of a problem since they yield an even lower
maximum delta-V. Contra-grav and thrusters are more of a problem, but
since both are based on gravitics now, I would have no qualms about
arbitrarily capping their delta-V relative to the planet/star system.
For civilian ships, how about 3000 km/s (0.01c--yielding KE of 0.36
megatons/ship ton). Military ships could go faster--I don\'t care.

Would anyone care to check my calculations? I was basing the 2500 km/s
on 70 G-hours of available reaction fuel.

As far as using HEPlaR as a weapon:
Clearly, civilian ships using any sort of fusion-rocket drives would
be watched closely by any local defense force and kept in regulated
space lanes, etc. If you want to be able to move around more freely
in populated star systems, use thrusters.

There may still be some "free energy" problems, but that was never
really an issue for me (at least not by itself).

Disclaimer: I am *not* trying to revive the rock-throwing debate. I
just want to point out that the rules as written are still consistent
with the "feel" of Traveller (with perhaps some ref interpretation,
but that\'s fine).

Depends on the character coding you are using. Baudot uses only *5*
bits per character. Several older character codings use 6 bit (2 octal
digits). I\'ve even worked on an old Honeywell system that used a 6-bit
character set. ASCII uses 7-bits. Yes, *seven*. The characters above
127 on your computer *aren\'t* ASCII, they\'re just whatever the
manufacturer decided to put there. I\'ve got several systems that have
*different* characters assigned to the 128-255 range.

EBCDIC was the first 8-bit character set, and is only used by IBM
mainframes. There are several "standard" 8-bit character sets.
ISO-Latin-1 thru Latin-9 are the most common. They all use ASCII for
the 0-127 range. Note that the PC character set is not a "standard".
ISO Latin-1 comes closest to "the" standard.

There are 16 and 32 bit standards "in progress". They both use ISO
Latin-1 as the 0-255 range. The 32 bit code (Unicode?) will support
*all* known character sets and have room left over.

Odds are that the Imperium uses a 32 or 64-bit character set.

Nice try, but the problem is that there is a decided difference between
*data* and *instructions*. Unless a program is specifically *told* to
treat some data as instructions, that data *can\'t* do anything on the
system. That\'s why computer viruses attach to executable files, not to
data files. The few "execptions" are in cases where a couple of email
packages allowed commands to be embedded in messages (a really,
*really* stupid design decision).

Heck, there are computer architectures in current use that *totally*
seperate the program and the data. They aren\'t even in the same memory
space. 

So the idea oof a *datastream* from another ship\'s IFF "taking over"
your IFF unit is about as likely as a file you are downloading taking
over your system *without* you telling your system to run the file.

Mind you, there *are* file transfer protocols that allow for automatic
execution of downloaded code. But they are fairly rare, specifically
*because* they can let someone take over your system!

Of course if the Imperium had *intended* the IFF to have that sort of
backdoor (perhaps just to load a routine to dump some info like the
last few stops, and then erase itself) then it\'s possible. But for them
to have that backdoor installed on their *own* ships doesn\'t make sense.

The "deyo chips" are a silicon life-form, and thus they can "eat"
circuitry and lay down new circuits. 

> Potentially it could hide in magnetic bubble rams.

Nope! Or at least not actively. Mag-bubble is based on a techonology
that isn\'t compatible with silicon (it\'s a *really* oddball form of
*garnet*). so the virus could *write* itself to mag bubble storage,
just like abny other piece of data, but it can\'t *execute* there (sort
of like a virus trying to "run" on a floppy).

Also, mag-bubble is rather odd as storage goes. It *isn\'t* randomly
accessible. Think of it as a long slot, twisted back on itself into
some pretty complex convolutions. The "bubbles" would be a sort of
double ended "peg" sliding along the slot. The read/write unit looks at
a peg, and notes which end is up. to read the next bit, it shoves that
pg into the opposite end of the slot, and grabs the one that gets
pushed out when it does so. To write a bit, the head looks at it, and
either passes it through, or flips it, depending on whether or not it
had the right value.

So a mag bubble module is much like a continuous loop *tape*. If you
just read a bit, you have to go through *all* the bits in the unit to
get back to that bit. They always get accessed in the same order. So it
*isn\'t* RAM. It\'s just a form or storage that\'s relatively permanent,
but writable, and only medium fast (faster than floppies,slower than
all but the slowest HDs,

In case you haven\'t guessed, I have a mag bubble module. :-)

Actually, his sort of thing would be done *anyway*. A crude form of
such a system is being planned *now*. Why? Because we\'d really like to
have advance notice before a large rock decides to re-arrange things
here on earth. With enough advance warning we might even be able to do
something about it.

BTW, orbits tend to be inherently chaotic. There are just too many
rocks out there for any *conceivable* computer to accurately predict
positions very much in advance.

On the downside, natural rocks will be travelling slow enough that you
can get away with once a week scans. That\'s enough to let the computers
go "ok, we should have a rock *here*, but it\'s actually *there*" and
revise the trajectory. If the revised trajectory comes near anything
important (like the 100 dia limit of a mainworld), somebody will be
notified, and then they get to worry about moving the rock.

But the amount of stuff to track rises sharply as the size goes down.
Worse, it goes up even more as you get farther out. And it\'s moving
slower, and harder to see.

Inner system stuff is easy to police. Outer system stuff is hard to
police, Oort cloud stuff is essentially *impossible* to police. Too
many rocks, scattered too far, and too damn far out. 

Just as an example, at 1000 AU out, it\'ll take light almost 6 days to
get to you. So any data you have from out there is 6 days out of date.
And a .1c rock doesn\'t need to be big. It\'ll be too small to see at
that range.

Still, it\'s the sort of thing that wouldn\'t get tried very often.

A sphere 1000 AU in radius has a volume of over 4 *billion* cubic AUs.
In other words, you\'d need 4 billion SDBS to have them about 1 AU
apart. And that\'s not counting the number of ships that\'d be in port
for repairs, refurbishing, and crew exchange. Or the number that\'d be
in transit to or from their "station".

Of course, if they file a flight plan for a *different* system, a lot

On the bright side, to pull it off, you have to start in the Oort
cloud, and do some damn fine piloting. 

Here\'s a "legit" use for high speed "rocks". 

If you have been invaded and are trying to fight a delaying action to
keep the enemy fleet away from the planet, you can try to "force" an
engagement away from the planet. The enemy, of course, will jump at the
chance, seeing as your fleet is big enough to be a serious nuisance
when they try to take the planet, but not big enough to be a real thret
in a standup fight.

Picture their surprise when you have 4 (or more) kamikaze SDBs
collide in the center of their fleet. They start way out and accelerate
for all they are worth towards the target point, from widely spaced
vectors. Sure, the random gas molecules in interplanetary space will
kill the crews. But when they collide, you are going to have a (very
small) star. It\'ll "kill" any ship within a *lot* of light seconds. 

Sure, it\'ll waste most of your fleet too. But consider how many folks
are going to be interested in attacking your system after an enemy
fleet "disappears" :-)

(BTW, I can\'t take credit for this idea. It comes from a short story
titled "The Bully and the Crazy Boy")

And cm^3 (cc) and ml are the same size too. But they both get used.
Just in different contexts.

I rather suspect that if (as I asume) your gasoline is sold in liters,
you\'ll find that the storage tanks at the place you buy it are measured
in kiloliters, not in cubic meters.

Kiloliter is a perfectly valid metric unit. So is cubic meter. And so
is stere, which is one of the original metric units:

weight		gram
length		meter
area		are  (as in hectare)
solid volume	stere
liquid volume	liter

This presents a problem. Cargo containers are longer than they are
tall, *and* have a square cross section. The square cross section is so
that they can have "tank" containers, which are basicaly a cylindrical
tank with the skeleton of a container built around it. Tanks with a
circular cross section are both stronger and *cheaper* than ones with
an oval cross section.

The "longer than tall" is for several reasons. First, because that way
they won\'t fall over if you leaving one sitting on a loading dock and
something bumps it. Second, because when you open the door on the end,
it\'s a lot easier to to deal with something that is long, than tall if
you are loading or unloading it. Finally, because long is better than
tall for both surface and air transport (ie the way containers get
moved to and from the port!)

So, we could have containers that are 2x2x3.5, 2x2x7, and 2x2x14 (1, 2
and 4 Td). But that 3.5 meter ceiling screws that up unless we stand
them on end. Which we don\'t want to do. (containers are *always* "this
end up" units!) And 2x2x14is just *way* too unweildy. 

Current containers are either 2.5x2.5x7.5 or 2.5x2.5x8 (I\'ll have to
check).  They screw up things too. 2.5 wide means you have to make all
of the hold have widths that are a multiple of 4 squares. Yech.

A "compromise" that might not be too bad is:

full	3x3x6	(4 Td)
half	3x3x3

We can say the extra .5 meters is partly deck, and partly the "rollers"
that the containers slide in and out on. It still requires a bit of
extra planning on hold areas to make them multiples of 3 squares wide
and long, but it works better than the other two ways.

I was thinking more along the lines of it being derived from a written

both ways.

William and his buddies were Normans. Norman is a corruption of
"Northmen". They *were* Norse, just a couple generations removed.

What\'s going on there is that the virus is infecting a "system"
consisting of the *application package*. In effect the program is
acting as a standard (but rather limited) architecture.

The only known case of something infecting multiple architectures was
the Internet Worm. It had code for two different OSes in it. It was
able to "infect" them both because it started by essentially getting
the OS to run a "script" (batch file to DOS types) and that was able to
determine which OS it was on, and run the right module.

Of course, the nature of piracy being what it is, if the pirates are 
smart, they don\'t hang around in the same system long enough for the 
Imperials to catch up with them...

> The local Baron petitions the Duke for help.  The Duke sends the 4873CruRon

This takes about say 2 weeks minimum.  Then the Duke sends a message 
to elements of the Imperial Navy (say another 2-3 weeks).  Then the 
Navy concentrates in the affected system (say another 2-3 weeks).  
That\'s 6 weeeks between when the pirates 1st start raiding the 
system, and when the Imperials finally put together a response.  4 if 
the Naval units involved are in system with the subsector Duke.  
After a couple of weeks, word of the piracy in the system is probably 
going to spread, and the system\'s going to dry up for the pirates to 
hang around anyways.  If the Pirates are smart, they hit the system 
for a couple of weeks then move on.  Without FTL communications, 
defending the backwaters from piracy would be a dicey proposition at 
best.  In developed systems, which have their own SDB\'s, the chances 
improve greatly...

Actually, I didn\'t challenge you...  Somebody else was saying they 
could see this ship plying the lanes in the Marches, and I didn\'t see 
it happening.  If it would work anywhere, it would work at the Core, 
as you\'ve suggested.

Actually, if you read canon, the answer is more accurately, some, but 
probably not a whole lot...  There are a few sources that show 
pirates having thrived in sectors which are not frontiers even prior 
to the Rebellion.  Assignment: Vigilante for 1.

I could see something like this working in convoys perhaps in core 
sectors, but remember that the nature of the Imperium is such that 
not even every world in Core is going to have a sizable SDB fleet.

It is a job that at least prior to the rebellion, that the Imperium 
was not always successful at.  Several TNS items mention problems 
with Vargr corsairs, in just about all of the coreward sectors 
bordering on the Extents.  Even Core is not garrisoned as heavily as 
Corridor sector was prior to the Rebellion, but Corridor still had 
problems with raids and piracy...

Granted.  The Imperium grew by showing a better ability to protect 
and encourage trade than its neighbors/rivals.  Another thought.  
Perhaps there were a whole lot less worries about piracy in the early 
years of the Imperium than later.  Even the CT universe was set 
during what was a decline period for the Imperium.  Perhaps 
increasing piracy prior to the rebellion was a sign that all was not 
well in Camelot...

    'body' => 'Here\'s a rough outline of a Simple Task System for use with Traveller.  
As far as I know, it could be used with any version of Traveller.  It\'s 
not meant to be used in some sort of super-heroic campaign, so there\'s no 
"impossible" task level.  If something is impossible, it is impossible.  
No need to roll. :)

The system is based on the idea that characteristics will range from 1 to 
15 in value, with 7 being average.  It is also assumed that skill levels 
will range from 1 to 6 or so, with 3 being the most frequently 
encountered skill level for someone who is considered well-versed in his 
area of expertise.  Finally, people with skill levels beyond three become 
increasingly rare (ie, 4 is rare, 5 is more rare, etc.).

With that out of the way, I present my Simple Task System:

==========================================================================
BASIC RULES
===========

1.	Determine the task difficulty.  (This can be determined using the 
MT rules, TNE rules, or make-it-up-as-you-go-along (my favorite method).)

2.	Add the character\'s relevant skill level and relevant 
characteristic.  For example, for firing a revolver it might be Dexterity 
and Revolver.  

3.	Roll the appropriate die from the table below based on the task 
difficulty.  If the maximum value is rolled, then the attempted task 
resulted in failure.

Task Difficulty		Die/Dice	Maximum Roll
Simple			1D10		10
Routine			1D12		12
Difficult		2D10		20
Formidable		2D12		24


4.	Otherwise, compare the value rolled with the value determined in 
step 2.  If the roll is less than or greater than, then the attempt was a 
success.  Otherwise, it was a failure.

That\'s all there is to it for the basic system.  If you\'d like some other 
features, go on to the next section.


ADVANCED RULES

Uncertain Tasks:  If you\'re fond of uncertain tasks, then the referee 
should make all task rolls.  Only tell the player what his or her 
character would know about the results. 

Mishaps:  If you like the idea of mishaps, then when a failure is rolled, 
make an additional roll.  If this additional roll also results in 
failure, then a mishap has occured. 

==========================================================================

I know the shortcomings of this system.  It ain\'t perfect.  But I\'m in 
favor of playability over realism, especially when it comes to things 
that are done as frequently as task rolls.  In my game, I\'d just use the 
basic rules.

If you have any additions or improvements for this system, please post \'em.

Actually their is published material which states that Grandfather went 
to great pains to destroy any and all Ancient sites and trinkets that he 
could find.  Check out Adventure 3 - Twilight\'s Peak, Adventure 12 - 
Secrets of the Ancients, and Alien Module 6 - Droyne.

For fear of getting involved in the virus debate, here is my 2 
indivisible units of local currency.  I would like to state that I don\'t 
own TNE, just MT and CT.  So a lot of what I know about the Virus is from 
reading this list.

Personally, I find the idea of the Virus silly.  A computer virus that 
can infect any hardware platform just by contacting it seems rather 
preposterous.

But then, after reading the arguements for the Pro-Virus faction, one of 
them rang a bell, that of the virus being alive and sentient.  I vaguely 
remeber reading an article in a magazine a few months ago about research 
being done into biological computers.  I\'m not to sure how they work, but 
that they do and are technically possible.  They only problem is that 
they take months or maybe even years to perform calculations.  I\'ll see 
if I can dig up the article and post a condesed version of it here.

My point is, what if 3000 years from now is this the architecture for 
computers?  It would be very possible to infect via contact, sort of like 
the common cold.

Anyway, just like has been pointed out, it is just a game.  There are 
many points of Traveller which are kind of hard to accept, but who 
cares.  It is possible to explain anything with enough speculation.  

Besides, if you don\'t like it, don\'t use it.  I haven\'t played or 
refereed to many RPG\'s where we didn\'t have house rules.

Charles,
I agree with you here, but then again, how does your average

No, I haven\'t made the correct changes to my copy of QSD (I printed it) yet
as I lost the message in which it was announced.  However, I have got a copy
now, and will redo the ship corrected if you want.

As a point of clarification, it was the technical wizardry and the natural
electronics abilities of the Hiver that prevented the spread of virus
throughout their realm.  Other references to Virus state that their effect
is just as pronounced throughout the alien realms as in Imperial space.  The
Aslan weren\'t affected quite as quickly as others due to diversity of clan
systems, but the Sneaks and Geeks supplement from CDW states that much of
Hiver space is currently in a state of rebuilding after the Virus attacks,
they just were able to catch the problem before it destroyed them.

I do however agree that we need to stop jumping on Larry\'s case just because
he doesn\'t believbe Virus is possible.  I don\'t believe it is possible to
expect modern and advanced civilizations to subject themselves to a fuedal
system of government without representation.  I know I will probably be
flamed for this, and I expect a bit of criticism, but I will not get into a
mudslinging fest over it!  (And, BTW, I commend Larry on his dropping out of
the Flame War before it escalated!

It has been pointed out to me that I used the wrong words in the above
listed point one.  I should have said that "Virus is alive and makes its own
choices, and therefore doesn\'t need to be executed to begin to take control"
rather than "doesn\'t need to be activated" 

Sorry for the mistake, please replace the appropriate word.

Yeah, but how many boarding actions have you seen against 
supertankers recently...  If somebody could come up with a cheap and 
quick way to mount SAM\'s and other defensive weapons on freighters, 
they might in a future war...  The facts are that in times of trouble, when 
it was feasible to do so, merchant ships have always been armed, if not 
prior to the start of a war, certainly as soon as the shots started to be fired...

And how effective would a deck gun be against ASM\'s or SSM\'s anyways...  
Remember that Chinese Silkworms owned by Iran did put holes in a couple
of supertankers back in the 1980\'s including some that were being escorted 
by the USN or other navies...

Eris,

On one hand, taxes increase the marginal cost of the product or service 
taxed.  So, the Imperium would actually be causing a marginal decrease in 
trade by taxing it.

On the other hand, that\'s never stopped any government anywhere before, 
so why would it stop the Imperium? :)

Which is just a long way of saying that a trade tax, assessed at 
starports, makes sense.  Good thought.

Wow.  That is impresive.  That\'s a West End Games product, is it not?

Perhaps the basic book could have a very simple (a la CT) world 
generation system (ie, without spectral classes, system generation, 
etc.), while the rest of that could be covered in a supplement....in 
great detail.  I love it when I get an RPG and actually learn something 
about the real world that I didn\'t know before.  When the author(s) go to 
the effort of researching the real world it\'s great.

Good point, it\'s better to not bend the book and crack the spine!  Then 
again, it\'s also better to not rip pages out.  Perhaps they could have a 
forms pack that would either be available separately or would be 
enclosed with the boxed Deluxe Traveller set.  That way you don\'t have 
to ruin your book in any way. :)

How many days \'till T4 comes out? :)

It occurs to me that at least some of the Virus debate is the result
of "overexplaining" how it works. It should be enough to say that ALL
Imperial/Solomani/etc. computers were vulnerable. "How?" "We\'re not
100% certain, so you\'d better not rely on your computers too much."
Explaining that it sends a binary copy of itself over the radio
which will infect *any* piece of silicon attached to a receiver is
asking for trouble, though.

Before anyone jumps down my throat: I do not own TNE, so I don\'t
know how much of this overexplaining is coming from the rules and
how much is from the TML membership. :-)
:END VIRUS ALERT!:

The same can be said for any currently unavailable technology. As
soon as you try to explain it, someone is likely to debate the
point. It may also be proven impossible as soon as you go to print.
Worse, it may introduce inconsistencies in the campaign universe
since you could not possibly think through all of the consequences.

Thus, for things like jump-drive, contra-grav/thrusters, and Virus,
the best approach is to explain them as little as possible. Better
yet, leave room for alternative explanations about how they work.
If you want Babylon 5-style J-drives, great! (Of course, you can\'t
have jump gates and still be using the Traveller setting.) I would
personally give at least three different *possible* explanations
for how *any* advanced technologies like these work. Put them in a
sidebar and let the referee choose which one to use. Of course,
they would all have to have the same effect on the overall game
setting. Now, the game mechanics will not be able to rely on the
*details* of technologies that don\'t exist (actually they could
rely on details that are present in all three explanations).

I think you can run the same type of adventures in an RC campaign, that
you can in a Classic Spinward Marches campaign.  Sure the Smash and
Grab adventures get people\'s attention, especially now that they have a
name for them, and GDW released a book of 6 such adventures. (Though I
think one of them, the one set on Leberhez, works better as a political
intrigue style adventure, and that is pretty much the way it is
written)  Two of those adventures were part of large military
operations, and I don\'t like that type of adventure much.  But the rest
were send in a small party and have them grab something.  Several CT
modules had the same type of setup.  Research Station Gamma comes to
mind, the players invade the station, and fight it out with several
security robots and then liberate the captives.  
	Path of Tears had many Smash and Grab adventure ideas, but it
also had the same number of Diplomatic ideas, mercantile ideas,
investigation ideas and bunch of others.  World Tamers Handbook had two
campaigns set up based on starting a colony.  
	In my campaign, I plan on running several CT Adventures, with
adjustments for local of course.  I think Divine Intervention works
pretty well, and Night of Conquest would be neat.  The Secret of the
Ancients is just a fun module,  and I want to run it.  Other adventures
I plan on running involve political intrigue among the member states of
the RC, pirates. Going to a Wilds planet, slowly exploring it and
getting to know the people, and helping to free the oppressed Droyne.
	I guess I choose to run a RC campaign, because its smaller.
This way I can easily develop a majority of the worlds.  Also I figured
my players who have never played Traveller would have an easier time
grasping two subsectors of worlds, rather than the entire Marches. Also
the dynamic nature of the constantly evolving RC is pretty neat.

I also thought about running a Regency campaign, or a Rebellion
campaign, but came down to the RC.
Well that\'s what I think, I hope it answers some of your questions.

first off...if you don\'t like Virus, go away, this isn\'t for you.

Some subversive NE thoughts:

This occurred to me riding in to work today. It seems rather deus ex
machina-istic, that the RC encountered Sandman in the fortuitous way
they did. That got me to thinking_where in the heck DID something
like a Peacekeeper virus come from_after all they evolved from war
machines. That led me to those most ex machina-istic of beings: The
Hivers.

(I do NOT have Aliens of the Rim, so if any of this is contradicted
by these sources, I\'m sure you all will let me know ;-)

(PS I also believe that the shadowy figure on the Grassy knoll is
actually a Hiver, so bear with me. I mean it\'s obvious_the aliens
controlling earth are these big grey reptilian beings who like shiny
new black 1965 Lincolns...it\'s pretty clear that the Greys aren\'t
controlling things, but that these Iklithur (SP?) are only the
Hiver\'s muscle on this planet ;-)

These facts are known: 

a)  The Hivers were grievously messed over by Virus and the
rebellion.

b)  They are master manipulators of societies_after all,
anything that could get a K\'Kree to willingly eat meat, is very very
good at it. 

c)  All sources indicate that they are also very good
with computers. 

d)  They are insatiably curious, and their tour bus
through the Rebellion mentioned in Survival Margin (SM), probably
wasn\'t the only recon mission into the Imperium. They probably
passed by Cymbeline at some point.  After all, they would be VERY
curious about a living computer circuit; any computer engineer worth
their salt would have probably been trying to get some of those
suckers into their lab for study. After the rebellion started, the
interdiction on Cymbeline came down_after all there is one passage
in SM about a high ranking Solomani party member going to Cymbeline
to investigate whether the chips would qualify as sentient beings.

e) They are manipulating (helping, sending in technical advisers, etc)
the RC. Historically they have done this in order to ensure stable
borders, and trading partners.

f)  Some Cymbeline chips readily became self aware, upon exposure to
enough external data sources and memory. (this is an old, old AI
standby, both in real life and SF: Enough computing horsepower +
stimulation from the real world = Self Awareness. Cf: Moon is a Harsh
Mistress, When Harlie was One, 2001)


This leads to my speculative points:

a)  The Hivers had samples of the Cymbeline chips prior to the release of Virus. They were studying them with the intentions, probably, of using them or some system derived from their study of them  to introduce some rather powerful TL 17 verging on 18

b)  This experience probably helped them reduce the damage to their systems and society.  It also made them very aware of just how dangerous to them the Imperium had been.  They certainly would take steps to prevent that from happening again.

c)  They have a crying need for intel on both what\'s left of the Imperium and what Virus has mutated into. The Puppeteer strain probably scares those six legged pants off them_after all even the name strikes a little close to home ;-).

d)  They\'ve always worked by inserting undercover agents into societies to study and manipulate them.

Peacekeepers here serve two purposes. First they are an ideal agent
to get intel on Virus society; they talk to all sides, learn their
weaknesses, strengths.  They can manipulate Virus society, witness
sandman\'s own manipulations on Promise.

Second, they are clear examples to the RC, of exactly how useful
sentient computers could be, if integrated into human society_if
they could be trusted.  How better a way to introduce trust than by
having this `spontaneous\' mutation of Virus into a strain that
actually sees great advantages in allying itself with humans.  After
all, there are clear evolutionary steps in the Virus  family tree to
this point: the Mother and God strains. Never underestimate the
power of self interest on either the RC\'s side or the Sentient
computer\'s.

Having the Hivers simply step in and say `Here\'s this great computer
we\'ve developed_RC meet Sandman, Sandman, meet the RC\' would
probably simply result in a lot of missile and/or laser fire.

But, a hot extraction of a clear human ally from a hostile
environment_now there\'s something to garner some trust in the RC and
the societal mythos that\'s developing the RC.

How does this help the Hivers? First, a friendly society, that sees
sentient computers as full members of society are a hell of a lot
less likely to use them as weapons in the fashion of Virus. 

Second, such a society would have a clear leg up on the competition
(the Regency).

Thirdly, the Hivers have a ready made soource of income_computing
technology.  If you think the average technofreak on earth today is
willing to spend bucks on toys, just think of what they would spend
if they WERE their toys!

Complications to this plot? 

Those wonderful Hivers Rouge (I\'m sorry, but the correct spelling is
rogue, but I love the resonance of the word_it sounds like some
secret  revolutionary party_\'a nest of Hivers Rouge\' sitting around
a Paris cafe, swilling wine, and plotting their overthrow of The
Man)

The Regency_they\'re powerful, they\'re heavily armed, and they HATE
Virus.

Resurgent Solomani_They\'re tough, they\'re mean, and they don\'t like
ANYbody else.

Thoughts, people?

Not obviously, although there are suggestions.  The clearest statement on
this is from _Regency Sourcebook_, on how the *Regency of Deneb* raised
funds, but the description there seems consistent with the Imperium as well.

The Imperium appears to raise money by taxing worlds and services, but not
individual citizens.  There is no "Imperial Income Tax".  Basically, the
Imperium tells member worlds how much they owe, and the worlds decide how 
to raise the money.  This tax burden can be reduced if the world suffers
some natural disaster, or can be increased if the Imperium builds a major
facility there, like a naval shipyard.  In terms of services, the Imperium
requires starships to pay licensing fees to operate, charges for certain
services offered at the local Imperial consulates, takes a cut of the
landing fees charged by starports, and so on.

Notice that *planets* may have a local income tax to pay off their debts
to the Imperium -- but they may just as easily operate a lottery, and use
the profits for the same thing, or a sales tax, or anything else they 
want, within reason.  If they feel unduly taxed by the Emperor, the world
can always appeal through its\' noble representatives to the Moot, which
can in turn put political pressure on the Emperor to relieve the local
tax burden.

The old version of _Striker_ notes that planets pay something like 30% of
their local military budget to the Imperium to support the Imperial 
military.  This comes to about one percent of gross planetary product in
most cases.  Based on separate calculations by Wildstar and myself, this
part of the budget alone is about TCr 2000 to 5000 annually.  This figure
would be split among the salaries, ships, operating equipment, supplies, 
and facilities all the Imperial armed forces, and probably includes 
"colonial" subsector reserves raised by the dukes as well.

I seriously doubt it. And as for the virus being able to watch what\'s going
on, it has to gain access to a circut first; Virus comes in two flavors:
Cymbeline chips and Data Packets. GDW said that they were interchangeable.
However, I\'ve yet to hear of software that can re-write roms (not proms).
Virus is just too faulty for any easy suspension of disbelief. My players
decided after two short (4-8 session) RC campaigns never to play in the
virus era again. Only one has renegged on that, of the 8 players. They all
felt it vwas just too incredulous. And so do I.

Larry, As I Recall, this subject got dropped last year as it couldn\'t be
kept to a rational discussion because some people kept spouting the same
gibberish constantly, bothering those who did try intelligent discourse.
(Thak the makers that PPugslie isn\'t here to make the anti-virus side look
bad ;-)

Those who like virus are gonna invoke the "How can we understand" line of
thought, without reguard for anythinng else.

Unfortunately for your line of thought, apple is merging code/data with
containerized applications (OpenDoc); a container holds code and/or data
and/or resources.

According to Rats and Cats, their aging table is one pooint lower than
imperial standard.

According to Vilani and Vargr, vilani have anywhere from +0 to +5 on the
aging table, reflecting the pureness and longevity of their vilani
ancestry.

Yes, some things would be different, especially for the Regency. The RQS
(Regency Quarantine Service) would probably be the Regency Customs Service.

The Ziru Sirkaa would still exist, again, like the regency, in a tightly
closed border situation; not that you can\'t enter, you just can\'t leave and
come back.

The vast majority of imperial space was already as bad off as the virus
left it... hard times fell courtesy of the war. Just step up the warfare,
and have dulinor and Lucan go to it in force, with lucan\'s black war
policies and dulinor taking vengeance for them in turn, and the collapse
does nearly as much damage as the virus would.

Pocket empires were already forming. (Astrogator\'s guide to diaspora, GDW).
Lots of them. In conflict.

The Solomani would ramin intact. Strephon gets to figt the solomani and dulinor.

The RC could rise real nice and easy... especially if the hivers want a
semi-puppet. Just make sure that black war hit near by... even if it was by
successor states to the imperium (IE, pocket empires.)

Margret and here faction kept pulling back... why would she stop? Probably
not enough ships to stop the rampant piracy.

etc.

You wind up with a virus free, no imperium, let\'s expand/explore/exploit

were what caused the end of life on thousands of worlds.

Up to now I have been using .50 inch graph paper (special ordered it
from an office supply house years ago) with each square equalled 1.5
meter (appox 5\', a very nice width <g>).  I could go up to 2m/sq or
down to 1m/sq, but the scaling effects won\'t be good.  <sigh> 

BTW, the reason I went out and got the 1/2" paper was so a cardboard
counter would fit nicely in the square and I wouldn\'t have all the
other lines cluttering up the deckplan.  I even made a pair of 44x56
square (1/2"/sq) mapboard, covered with plastic laminate, so I could
lay down pre-drawn plastic sheets, and draw in (and erase) different
features.  Later I also bought blank hex boards from Avalon Hill. 
Squares for interiors.  Hexes for exteriors. <g>

>Make corridors 1 metre (1/5 inch) wide - give the extra space to

Corridors are one reason I liked the 1.5m square.  One meter is a
narrow corridor, measure it out and imagine the problems of two people
passing, moving equipment, or *any* kind of combat along a corridor
that narrow.  Two meters (~6.5\') make a corridor a little wider than I
like.  

I do realize very narrow corridors are probably more realistic
(submarine model), but wider corridors are more playable..IMHO.

It\'s just occurred to me to see if I can find 1 cm graph paper (I
*know* the world outside the US isn\'t standardized on 1/4" squares
<g>)!  It would be a slightly larger scale, but I could go to
1cm/meter.  That would be very convenient for scaling.  The common .5"
cardboard counters would cover 1.27m (~4\')...I could live with
that...an individual having a 4\' diameter personal space is more
realistic than the 5\' I was using.

I certainly will take a look.

One last thing, most of my gaming the last few years has been done
online, PBEM.  As an aid, I created blank hex grids at different
scales using regular ASCII characters.  I\'ve included an abbreviated
example of one size below (it looks good using a monospaced font, but
forget it if you only use proportional <g>)...

take near the bandwidth as graphical equivalents, are displayable
directly in email/echomail readers, print nicely (and quickly), and
they are easy to regenerate (if I lose my templates <g>) with simple
cut and paste.

Have other folks done the same kind of thing?

Um, I have bad news for you.  Cargo containers come in a wide
and painful variety of sizes.  My senior thesis project at UC
Berkeley in Naval Architecture was a 4500 TEU (Twenty-foot container
equivalent) jumbo sized containership for the pacific rim traffic.
I know more about this than anyone ever should...

Containers come in one width: 8 feet.  [This is going to be discussed
in feet because that\'s what the standards were written in and it all
comes out even that way...]

Containers have several lengths: 10 feet, 20 feet, 40 feet, 45 feet,
48 feet, and there are jumbo lengths out to 80 feet available
special order.

Containers come in several heights: 8 feet, 8 feet 6 inches,
and 9 feet 6 inches.  I think there are a few oddball 9 footers
around too but I think those were mostly abandoned.

The *most standard* containers are the 20 and 40 by either
8 feet or 8\'6" high, with a fair number of the 45 footers thrown
in for good measure.  But you have to be able to handle all
of them at cargo handling facilities, much to the disgust of
many engineers whose lives would be amazingly more easy if there
were less types of them to worry about.

I have an alternate suggestion.  Let\'s have two classes of 
container, small and jumbo container.  Jumbo containers are a full
deck high, 3.5 meters, and are used for packing large objects which
need that much space or very large lots etc.  Small containers are
half that height, 1.75 meters (about 5 foot 9" tall).  They are used
when getting things down from the top of the container would be
inconvenient, etc.  You can crouch down and walk in them if you
have to, (even me, and I\'m 6\'5"/195cm).  Standard widths would
be 2 meters for the small containers and 4 meters for the jumbo.
Jumbo containers would come in 6 and 9 and 12 meter long standard
sizes, making them 12 and 18 and 24 displacement tons respectively.
Small containers are 5.5, 8.5, and 11.5 meters long.  There are
standardized frames which are 0.25 meter long and interlock 4 small
containers together at the end, and provide the handling and
tie-down interfaces of jumbo containers, so you pack 4 same length
small containers headed to the same destination together and
then handle it like a jumbo until it gets there.  The small
containers would be 2.75, 4.25, and 5.75 displacement tons
respectively for the short medium and long units.

So, as a short table:
	Length		Disp Tons	M^3	Usable
Jumbo	6		12		168	165
4m w	9		18		252	248
3.5m h	12		24		336	330

Small	5.5		2.75		38.5	35
2m w	8.5		4.25		59.5	55
1.75m h	11.5		5.75		80.5	75

The problem with this is that it\'s more like a pacific-ocean sized

This, possibly, is the killer problem.  Systems should not be
sparsely defended.

This would tend to indicate that pirates should be more heavily
armored than we see typically, but not rule them out.

There is no piracy threat to speak of to modern merchant vessels.
If there was, you\'d see small deck gun installations and a few
Gabriel or equivalent SSMs on them.

In my campaign, the human empire earned it\'s money by loaning out
cash to build starships.  Over 40 years the the total cost to the
owner is twice the cost to build.  Not bad income.

Also, 2000cr per passenger per jump was realy 1000cr tax and
1000cr for supplies.  Same for low traveller, half was tax the 
other half was for supplies and repairs.

They also charged a tax on goods stored at the starport.
Additionally, the empire ran it\'s own bank, which charged
for services (fees based on one social standing).

To defy logic does not in itself mean something is impossible.  Take a
flashlight
back two hundred years and the best minds of that time would not be able to 
explain it to you.  However, once they learned the principles it would no longer
defy logic.

I can easily imagine two people being able to communicate by means I can not

Sensors do it. Modern sensors are programmed for a variety of reasons.
The primary reason is that of optimizing for the current environmental
conditions. If the concept here is that the sensors are like huge
telescopes or massive radar dishes, think again. The current trend is
for these things to get smaller. 

With synthetic aperature processing (a sensor function), the code
requirements increase and physical aperature requirements decrease
dramatically.

For simplicity sake, these things are left out of Traveller *canon*.
IMHO the sensor sizes for the ship design sequence are way too big.
Bumping into current physics aside, what we could resolve with a
football-sized antenna, your friendly black and white can do with a
handheld coffe-can device. And, this jump was in the last 50 years.

The ability to do this is due to software. When you integrate a sensor
into an integrated avionics system (eg. for fire control) the sensor
must be programmable to meet the needs of the integrated system.

If you do not believe me, Lockheed Martin in Georgia is hiring software
engineers for both intergated avionics and sensor controls.

 Hate to pop your bubble, but it seems that almost _all_ of the

 Apple designs.  Now, had you said East German, you\'d have made

I was actually quite disappointed when I heard that T4 would be using only
six-sided dice.  How this is going to work with FF&Sv2, BL, and BR, I don\'t
know.  I agree that d30\'s and the d100\'s (made by Game Science) were probably
taking this need a little too far, but the fact remains that you can\'t easily
create every result-curve using (strictly) d6\'s.  Shadowrun suffers because it
is firmly rooted in a system using strictly six-sided dice.  Granted, six-sided
dice are more common, but polyhedral dice have been around for over twenty
years-- I doubt there are many people that do not own a few or have ready access
to some.  White Wolf\'s Storyteller series uses d10\'s exclusively, and is one of
the most successful RPG series available.  Polyhedral dice (especially d%, which
most people take to rather easily) shouldn\'t be shunned just because it means
that they aren\'t readily available.

If you want to get anal about lead figures, check out Games Workshop (Wadda ya
mean I can\'t use dis guy if I don\'t \'ave a "official" painted miniature?).

I\'m guessing they threw Charisma in there as a way of moderating social 
skills.  A number of the player\'s I have known are completely incapable 
of interacting with others on a one to one level.  Perhaps that\'s why 
they threw it in.  Lets face it though everyone dumps their lowest skill 
level into Charisma.
Social Standing in TNE is really important only in generating money, it 
doesn\'t convey any social advantages in either the RC or the Regency, 
despite the fact that nobility is still around in the Reg, they\'ve had 
their powers chopped so bad they may as well not be noble\'s.

AFAIK, scientists are talking about it now. I wouldn\'t give it more than
another 100 years before we can do something like that.

High TLs (and Soc Standings) should give a DM on the aging table (and low

I hope T4 is going to have more sensible aging rules.  The idea that
everyone TL 0-TL 15 begins aging at 34 stretches belief rather far. When
I run I tend to modify the again charts so that characters from Industrial
and Pre-Stellar planets age at the listed rate.  Characters from Early
Stellar start again one term later and gain a +1 bonuses to their aging
rolls, Characters from Average Stellar Societies Start aging two terms
later and gain +1 to again rolls, and characters from High Stellar
societies start again 3 terms later and gain a +1 bonus to aging rolls. 

Anyone know if T4 is going to make Hi tech medicine actually feel hi tech?

That\'s one reason I brought it up. <g>

Just because the standard square is 2x2x3.5 (1dt), doesn\'t mean the
overhead has to be 3.5!  A cargo ship wouldn\'t have 3.5m overheads
anyway, that\'s be too low.  What about designing cargo holes to be 7
meters high?  Now a square is 2x2x7 (2dt).

Standard containers could come in the following sizes:

    Size    Cargo   Floor
   H&WxL   Storage  Space   
   ----
1  2x3.5     1dt   2x4=8m,    Stack 3 high,   .50 m walk space 2  2x7      
2dt   2x8=16m,   Stack 3 high,  1.00 m walk space   3  2.8x7.14  4dt  
3x8=24m,   Stack 2 high,   .86 m walk space 4  3x6.22    4dt  
3x8=24m,   Stack 2 high,  1.78 m walk space 5  3x7.77    5dt  
3x8=24m,   Stack 2 high,   .24 m walk space 6  3.45x5.88 5dt  
4x6=24m,   Stack 2 high,   .12 m walk space  7  3.4x7.26  6dt  
4x8=32m,   Stack 2 high,   .76 m walk space 8  4x7       8dt  
4x8=32m,   Stack 1 high,  1.00 m walk space 9  6x9.33   24dt  
6x10=60m,  Stack 1 high,   .67 m walk space A  6.9x10.6 36dt  
8x12=96m,  Stack 1 high,  1.40 m walk space

(I could have made number 7, 3.5 square, and number A, 7 square, but
you need a little wiggle room between the containers and the
overhead.)

I wouldn\'t expect *all* these sizes to be standard.  I wanted to give
everybody a look at some options.  Which ones would *you* use for
cargo?

Learn something every day!  <g> 

I\'d never heard of Stere before, looked it up, Stere = 1 cubic meter,
sure enough.

So now, how do we abbreviate stere?  Is it "st", as in 1400st meaning
1400 cubic meters?

The only way I can imagine "Virus" working is if a consistent and
universial system for computer systems was in place.  The advanced
computers (at least) would have to be designed to routinely exchanged
data *and* code, desgined to have
self-modifing hardware and software capability, and be designed by
people stupid enough to leave a hole in system security large enough
for...for "Virus" to drive through.  Could something like this happen? 
Sure, we\'re dumb enough to do it. <g>

For gaming purposes, I would accept that it *could* happen...just like
I accept that jump drive could happen.  This doesn\'t mean I really
believe it, but this is a game...why argue?  <g>

Personally, I never used the big V in any games.  I collapsed the
Imperium without it. War, stupidity, and economic chaos did the trick
just fine for me.  Besides, I\'d killed the possibility of advanced
computers in my universe anyway, so "Virus" just wasn\'t possible.

But again, why argue?  Don\'t like it, don\'t use it!

        According to the errata published for FF&S, "Surface area in square
meters is the hull material colume *(after hull form and airframe
modifications but without adjustment for hull thickness)* mulitplied by
100." (Text between \'*\' added).

        The volume modified by hull form and airframe but not thickness is
simply MV*MVM*1.3.

So, ultimately, under this system it would be up to the individual worlds 
(which might be further subdivided into smaller political units, which 
might be further subdivided...) which items are taxed.  Still, each level 
would decide how much tax is due from the next lower level.  This implies 
the higher level would still have to have some basis for taxation.  Hmmm.

Ah, now we get to the heart of the matter.  Taxation is based on the 
military spending of the planet in question.  

What if the planet decides not to have a military?  Or to operate only a 
tiny military?  Presumably, the Imperium\'s ships are there to protect 
against interstellar conquest at least to some degree.  In other words, 
how much military spending is considered enough to the Imperium?  How do 
they decide?

No, not bad at all. Probably angered the financial institutions a bit,

So, there was no profit to be made on selling passage, eh?  Hmmm.  Not

True. Anyone who has ever made a serious attempt at creating a system for 
use with Traveller has run into that one.  2D6 isn\'t as lousy as D&D\'s 
3D6 curve, but it still falls far short of what is needed.  For instance, 
there is no easy way to make a roll that gives the player a 50/50 
chance.  7+ gives a better-than-50% chance, and 8+ gives a worse-than-50% 
chance.  That always bugged me.

I\'ve been partial to 2D12 for quite a while, but that\'s probably just 
me.  The same problems occur as with 2D6, but with less severity.

Yeah, but I like the elegance of using one type of die for everything.  
It\'s not logical, but it appeals to me.

But carbo containers must still be allowed to fit into ships with only a 3.5m
tall ceiling (more like 3m plus 0.5m for pipes, air ducts, lighting, etc) just
in case.  Such an example might be the CT version of the Empress-class far
trader or the aft bay of a Sulieman-class scout/courier.  When drawing deckplans
for a ship\'s cargo bay, I often recalculate the area of the cargo bay after
substituting a more manageable ceiling height.  After all, it would make more
sense *game wise* to design a cargo bay around a standard container size than
the other way around.  This way, there would be less wasted space.

A 2m by 2m by 4m container (1 Disp ton) would work nicely in both applications
(3.5m vs. 7m ceiling).  It would have to be a little bit larger than a 2x2x3.5m
displacement ton, to make up for the volume of the container itself.  Three of
these containers could be stacked on top of each other to fit within a 7m high
cargo bay.

A 3m by 3m by 8m container (5 Disp tons) would also be fine, fitting beneath the
suspended ceilings of 3.5m high cargo bays.  By your calculations, it also would
be slightly larger than 5 disp tons to allow for the material volume of the
container.  Two of these containers could be stacked on top of each other to fit
within a 7m high cargo bay, as well.

I assume that we will be allowed to "fudge" our deckplans by 10-20% like we were
allowed to with previous versions of Traveller.  I wouldn\'t worry about it too
much  8-)

You know, that could be it.  Esp. in the case of players or the referee 
playing a character whose gender is opposite of his/her own, doing a 
romantic scene with another participant.  Never bothered me, but our 
group was pretty tight and not into the whole juvinile attitude about 
such things.

But, you\'re right, that sort of one-on-one interaction is probably a 
problem for a lot of people.

Ah, now it makes sense.  I didn\'t know that social standing took such a 
back seat in TNE, but that makes sense.

The *Regency* taxes heirarchially (surprise), which makes a lot of sense
as it allows a great deal of tax burden realignment on all levels.  I.e.
The Regency taxes the subsectors which tax the systems which tax the
planets which tax the states, etc, ad nauseum.

quickly, based on my own ideas and those of Andrew Boulton and John 
Snead, in addition to general discussions of aging and, of course, the 
original Traveller rules.  

Please comment on this and add to it, so we can hammer out something that 
works well.

Note:  For TNE, subtract 1 from all listed ages, since TNE starts at 17 
while CT and MT start at age 18.

=========================================================================
				Aging

Beginning at age 34 (the end of Term 4), aging effects begin to occur.  
Throughout this discussion, Terms will be used rather than listing the 
actual age or listing both.  


For terms 4-9, the saving throw is 8+, the possible loss is -1, and the 
affected characteristics are Strength, Dexiterity(Agility), and Endurance.

For terms 10-15, the saving throw is 9+, the possible loss is -1, and the 
affected characteristics are Strength, Dexterity(Agility), and Endurance.

For terms 16-21, the saving throw is 10+, the possible loss is -2, and the 
affected characteristics are Strength, Dexterity(Agility), Endurance, and 
Intelligence (possible loss of -1 from Int only)

For terms 22+, the saving throw is 11+, the possible loss is -2, and 
the affected characteristics are Strength, Dexterity(Agility), Endurance, 
and Intelligence.


Modifiers:

	Tech Level:
		0-3: -2 on saving throw
		4-5: -1 on saving throw
	      11-12: +1 on saving throw
	      13-15: +1 on saving throw, possible loss is always -1.

	Social Standing:
		0-4: -1 on saving throw
		A-F: +1 on saving throw

====================================================================
Notes:

Using this table, and assuming that PC\'s are going to have TL 13+ 
facilities available most of the time, it breaks out like this:

Terms		Average point loss per characteristic
4-9		2.52 points
10-15		3.54 points
16-21		4.38 points
22-28		5.02 points
		===========
Total Loss:	15.46 on Str, Dex/Agi, and Con

This allows for the possiblity of a character living forever (always 
getting lucky rolls), but it is a slim chance.  An average character 
getting average rolls will live for about 86 years if s/he lives in a TL 
13-15 society.  An average character living in a low tech socity will 
have a much shorter life span, on average.
========================================================================


Well, that\'s it.  What do you think?

    'topic' => 'Size of Imperial Navy (semi-long), actually rather long',
    'body' => 'Referencing the Rebellion Sourcebook, each sub-sector had one numbered and
one reserve fleet.  Each numbered fleet was supposed to be composed of
between 50 and 200 ships organized into Squadrons of about 20-25 ships. 
The Squadrons were organized into 5 types, BatRons, CruRons, ScoutRons,
AssaultRons, and TankerRons.  

I would expect a 25 ship BatRon to be composed of 8-12 BBs, and 12-15
Auxiliaries.  The Ron was supposed to be a totally independent fighting
unit with all the support ships it needed to survive.  The 12-15 support
ships were most likely (IMHO) 1-2 Fleet Carriers, 1-2 Cruisers (not Heavy
but Light or Strike), 6-10 Escorts, and a Fleet Tanker.  A standard BatRon
would most likely have assigned to it 5-15 couriers, and at least 1 combat
assault unit. (per info from Rebellion and Fighting Ships of the Shattered
Imperium).  Supplement 9 Fighting ships says that a Tigress BatRon had 8
BBs in it, and there was only 1 in the Spinward Marches.

The CruRon would be about the same size with 8-12 Cruisers either Heavy,
Armoured, Strike, or Light.  The CruRon could be homogeneous, or mixed in
types.  I could see 4 Heavy, 4 Armored, 2 Light and 2 Strike in a 12 ship
CruRon, or an 8 Armored CruRon.  The CruRon would also have Carrier
Support, most likely 2-4 Light Carriers, 10-15 escorts, and maybe 1-4
Tankers.  It may or may not have the ground assault group, but it most
likely would have a large supply group to rearm the Cruisers for Planetary
Bombardment.

The ScoutRon is supposed to be made up of ISS ships, and little other than
that is ever stated, except to say that scouts are usually assigned to
other Rons as needed.

The AssaultRon\'s job is supposed to be to conduct an opposed landing on
another world, and support the ongoing operations of that assault.  I
would expect large numbers of large Bulk carriers, along with Assault
Landers, and troop transports.

Lastly the TankerRon.  Supposedly these are to provide refueling service
to the other Ron\'s, a job that would imply that like the ScoutRon, they
are assigned as needed to other Rons.

So, if each Fleet has 2-10 Rons of 20-25 ships each, for roughly 150 ships
per fleet (on average), with 320 numbered fleets, and 320 reserve fleets,
then one could expect at the start of the Rebellion to have roughly
100,000 ships (with 50-60% being capital ships (Carriers, Cruisers, and
Battleships).  Of the Ships of the Line, they would likely break down into
10-20% Carriers, 50-60% Cruisers, and 20-40% Battleships.  So how about
5,000-12,000 Carriers (BTW carrying between 1.5-3.6 MILLION fighters),
then 25,000-36,000 Cruisers (which could carry in the neighborhood of
625,000-900,000 fighters (at 25 per Cruiser some carry some do not)), and
10,000-150,000 Battleships (most of which carried fighters in CT, not in
MT for anywhere from 1.5-22.5 MILLION fighters at 150 per ship, of course
it could be much less)

All in all we can see that the Imperial Navy is Huge! with 11,000 worlds
in the Imperium, they support a Navy of 10 ships per world, with about
half of those capital ships.  This would add up to anywhere from about
500,000 MCr just for the Capital Ships per World!!!  Now we know where
Trillion Credit Squadron gets its name from.  So with say an average cost
of 75,000 MCr per Capital Ship (allowing for a lower cost for reserve
fleets, and 50,000 Capital Ships, then how about a rough cost of
3,750,000,000 MCr., and with anywhere from 4-25 Million fighters at say
100 MCr each for a total cost of 420,000,000-2,500,000,000MCr for the
fighters.  Auxiliaries are just about impossible to add up due to the fact
that most are not even designed anywhere, but they would not be cheap. 
All in all, the Imperial Navy is so huge, it is no wonder that the
Rebellion went on for so long.

The other thing that this means is that there are lots of fighters in the
Imp Navy, and each one requires a pilot.  There might be a crew size of
1000 (CT) or 7,000 (MT) for BBs, and 500 (CT) or 1,500 (MT) from cruisers.
 This would add up to about 10-150 Million crew for the BBs, 25-36 Million
crew for the Cruisers under (CT), and 70-1,050 Million for BBs, and
37.5-54 Million Cruiser Crew (MT)  The Capital Ships then would have a
crew need of 35-190 Million crew plus fighters at 2 each under CT, and
120-1,100 Million crew in MT if the Imperium pays each crewmember just
2,000 Cr per month (low) then the Imperium would need anywhere from
80,000-2,200,000Mcr just for crew salaries (actually you can about double
this to include all the other personnel.)

In conclusion the Imperium would spent roughly 3,750,000,000MCr on Capital
Ships (say 1/2 that for all auxiliaries) for a total cost of
5,625,000,000MCr in ships, and 160,000-4,400,000MCr per Month on Salaries.
 This means that the Imperial Navy Spends at most 8% of its Hardware Value
on salaries each month.  I do not know if this is a feasible amount, and
this just sort of took off on its own.  Questions, Comments, I hope that
someone finds this interesting.

Larry, I must obey the laws of nature.  One of those laws states that if
your lymphatic system goes beserk you die within a year or two of Hodgkin\'s
Disease.  However, the *sentient* doctors at Stanford, used their

Have you ever gone somewhere new and said to yourself "hmm  too warm/cold, I
best buy a swimsuit/sweater"?  That is what Virus does!  We aren\'t talking
about Lucan\'s geek coder corps waiting to ship upgrades, it modifies itself.
IT IS ALIVE!

*Every* commercial aircraft in the world carries a transponder that meets a
US standard.  This is due to the dominance of the US as a trade
market/aircraft builder.  Anybody who ever wanted to do business with the
Imperium would have the correct transponder.  Over the years, it would
become a standard throughout charted space.

As irrelevant as the fact that as a product of my genetic make-up *and*
enviroment I am a completely different creature from my father? or mother?
or siblings?  This is evolution in action!  Virus lives at a much greater
rate than us fleshies.. witness the rapid sub-class growth as the original

This is too much.  Larry, would you go place you hand on a stove top that\'s

So is therefore forbidden?  Please, get a grip on what you are doing here.
You have dismissed a good portion of the arguements against you out of hand.
This smacks more of an attempt to bolster a weak position than a  real
attempt at discussion.

Can you say TL 16.  Virus was *new*.  Nobody had ever seen it before.  I\'m
sure that ships had ICE-type software to stop downloading of conventional
virii into the ship\'s computer, but they were as helpless against Virus as
the Japanese were against the A-bomb.

And at the tail end of a disasterous war, a shattered economy.  Virus was a
black project.  How many TL 15 worlds were left when the Virus spread?  How
long did it take for the factions to understand what had happened?  Dulinor
was dead on an obscure planet, Lucan disappers, and the lights go out all
over the Imperium..

Hardly the enviroment for an orderly investigation of the event.  Especially
when the primary carriers of Virus at the time were psychopathic warships!

My God.

First off, if you don\'t know the difference between biology and computer
engineering, I suggest you gain possesion of a high school Bio text quickly.

HIV is a *virus* that causes a victim\'s immune system to shut down.  It can
only be transferred by bodily fluids.

It is fatal.  and not funny.

Larry, I have a Virus of sorts.. my own body spent the last year trying to
kill me.  No known cause for it, it just was.  I DO NOT appreciate ANY sort
of comparison between a fictional plot device and a disease that has claimed
too many friends.

AIDS through a telephone?  As about as bloody likely as you making a
rational arguement, or posting without the word "Irrelelvant" being misused.

(Apologies for the flame, but this just set me off.)

Strangly, after about seven years of not playing MT, those Rons still 
seem familiar to me.  It\'s amazing how much "useless" information we 
store...

I especially remember the ScoutRons and TankerRons, because it didn\'t 
make sense to me to establish separate Rons for equipment and personnel 
that would simply be then divided amongst the other Rons as needed.  But 
then, I\'m not familiar with the necessities of military tactics. Maybe 
someone with more knowledge in thi area can explain it?

No wonder so many characters turn out to be from a military background.  
The Imperial military must be the #1 employer. :)

Yep, West End Games.  In fact, all of their Star Wars products have a high
degree of quality in them.  The layout is excellent and the interior art is
great.  They\'re all in hardcover (which I like) and have a cool picture
taken from the movies\\painted on the front.  Excellent books.

The only problem with giving them seperately is that\'s yet another product
you need to buy.  I wouldn;t mind, but I\'m sure some people would.  What IG
could do is have a form in the main book on the back inside cover.  That\'s
what I did with my SWRPG book.  I photocopied the sheet once, and then taped
it onto the backcover so that it\'s easy photocopy.

Another idea would be for IG to make up HTML or Abode PDF character sheets,
and other forms available freely on their Web page.  IG, are you listening
to this?? :)

 Actually, I liked th idea of Charsma.  It offered the supporting attribute
for those skills that didn\'t seem to belong to any othe attribute.  Like
Carousing, Leadership, Persuasion, and Service among others.  You could
argue that these skills could fall under Intelligence or Education, but I
don\'t buy it.  I worked as a Manager at a Burger King for nearly two and a
half years and there were some intelligent and well educated kids in there,
but they just didn\'t have the personality (charisma) to be good in the
service industry.  Similarly, one of the other managers was an intelligent
and educated individual, but he didn\'t have the personality (charisma) to
lead the crew effectively.  I think charisma has an appropriate place in the
skill system TNE used.  If MMT bases skills on attributes in a similar (even
remotely) manner, I hope they use Charisma, because I don\'t see Social
Standing as having an effect on your Service skill or your Carousing ability!

The idea came from an old CT module called Signal-GK.  Some of you have 
it so you\'ll know more about it than I.  There\'s a Solomani ship that 
crashes on Cymbline.  When the rescue team shows up they find that the 
computer chips have been hijacked by these local silicon based lifeforms 
and had their chip structure altered (I hope that\'s basically right).

In TNE the Virus is based off these chip, only 1000\'s of times more 
advanced, so technically the term "Virus" is something of a misnomer it 
should be known as, "That wicked silicon based life form that 
accomplished in a year what the forces of the Imperium had been working 
on for twelve."  8)  Or something like that.

Active sensors would be extremely difficult to infect, passive sensors, 
short of optical telescopes would be extremely easy as they\'re just a big 
set of ears picking up every peice of electromagnetic radiation flying 
about the local area.

Was listening to the radio the other day.  Thursday mornings Larry and 
Willy to the "Internet Geek of the Week."  It\'s got a pretty solid 
following.  Anyways, they had a computer repair tech phone in with a 
story.

He was on the phone to a customer discussing some software problems and 
the fellow said:

CUST:  By the way I\'ll have to bring my computer in the cup holder\'s 
broken.

TEC:  Pardon?

CUST:  My cup holder, it\'s broken.

TEC:  Sorry your cup holder?  Did this come as part of a special 
promotion or something?

CUST:  No, came with the computer.

TEC:  A cup holder?

CUST:  Yep.

TEC:  Is there a brand name written on it?

CUST:  Nope, just says x4 on the front.

Needless to say the poor technition just about killed himself laughing.

 Hmmm, that\'s why my numbers were soo off the wall when I checked them
against that recent post. Thousand pardons, I have *no* idea where the
100,000 worlds came from. Bleh, I\'m out of it today :P

Current First World lifespan is now at 78 years.  86 Years seems like a
good TL 8/9 average.  As I see it, Lifespan should be *lots* longer by TL
15.  I would say a minimum of +2 and perhaps +3 to again rolls by TL 14
(High Stellar).  A good TL 14-16 lifespan would be perhaps 150 (at
minimum). 

I see aging starting at 34 under the current rules as being accurate for 
someone with no special medical care.  Once you subtract infant mortality 
and death in childbirth the CT/MT aging system looks pretty good for 
modeling well fed premodern lifespans.  I would not penalize the 
listed figures except for TL 0-2 civilizations.

Modern medicine can\'t do much about aging, but modern medicine is 
advancing *very* fast.  We have not yet mapped the human genome or begun 
to really understand how many drugs and body processes work.  We will 
likely have this knowledge within 20-30 years.  

By the time a society hits TL 10 (which includes limb regeneration and 
10:1 growth quickening) I would expect medicine to be able to slow aging 
and to reverse it\'s effect (to some extent).

Before we write rules, how about deciding average lifespans:

My vote:

TL 7-8:    70-80

TL 9-10:   90-100 

TL 11-13:  120-130

TL 14-16:  140-150

I\'m not including the effect of anagathics here, and I\'m being (in my
opinion) *very* conservative.  Realistically I\'d make the averages more
like: 

TL 9-10:  100-110

TL 11-13: 140-150

TL 14-16: 170-180

But I imagine that these figures will be even more objectionable to many
of you.

Argh!  You mean there\'s still time to fix things like:


...Changing "Sample Ship Description" to read "Sample Ship *Descriptor*" to be
consistant with the rest of SSDS (and QSDS).

...Giving a brief description of the different hull configuration
classifications (What\'s a "Closed Structure Hull"-- did it have an unfortunate
childhood?).

...Finding out if Thruster Plates are TL11 or TL12?

...Add periods to the ends of the first two sentences in the SELECTED OFFENSIVE
WEAPONS section.

...Include the "1 turret per 100t" rule of thumb (like the one used for bay
weaponry).

...Give prices for the basic missiles (yuck) from the T4 Ship Combat System.

...Add text to limit the number of Spinal Mounts that can be installed.

...Delete the reference to Tractor/Repulsors or add in a table for those
defensive weapons.

...Explain the Stealth table.

...Explain the differences between Basic and Standard Life Support.

...Get rid of the FF&S page reference under Small Craft & Launch Facilities, and
include a description of Launch Tubes.

...Maybe explain why you\'d want to use TL9-11 Fusion plants when TL8 Fission
plants are cheaper & smaller (ie: what are the game effects to using fission).

...Include TL7 (8?) Fuel Cells so geeks like me can get our kicks designing
small, primitive TL8 & 9 vessels that threaten to fall apart or blow up at the
slightest bump (Yee-Hah!).

...Finally give better descriptions prior to each table and/or section if there
is still time (unless this text has been withheld and is planning to be
"borrowed" from FF&S).


Whew!  I accidentally failed to save this reply twenty minutes ago and I had to
type it all back in all over again. (I hope I\'m not forgetting anything-- Ow!  I
think I\'m developing CTS.)  I don\'t want to nit-pick but I can be sure that I am
speaking for everyone that we simply want SSDS to be smooth and clean.

I would suggest running your copy of the final draft through Word\'s spell
checker one more time since I came across a few mistakes when I did the same.
I\'ve spend a few hours modifying your final draft, improving page formatting,
adding boarders & shading to the tables, and adding a few notes, so my copy
isn\'t "original" anymore.  If you want, I could send you a copy once SSDS is all
done & finished.

I read about this somewhere (but I\'ve forgotten in which book; maybe
Chickenhawk):  During the Vietnam War, North Vietnames forces often acquired
U.S. weapons in large quantities (sometimes by slipping into U.S. bases and
stealing them).  U.S. troops at a certain base rigged all of the grenades in
a crate (or maybe several; I forget) for zero delay.  It was duly stolen.
After an attack on that base, the battlefield showed evidence that a lot of
grenades had gone off in hands of those throwing them.

I guess that you assume some risk if you take the other side\'s stuff.

Subject: Robots in the Imperium (fwd)



Being a non-gearhead, but avid Imperial Historian, I was wondering what 
would the state of robotics in Year 0.

We did know they excisted, given that CT Book 8 listed the history of 
robotics  back to before Year 0. What I want to know is what is the social 
climate for robots.

In order to show how, I will make a few definitions:

1. The average TL11 person  has more computing power in a watch than NORAD 
and NASA together today. His "computers" would be so powerful that it would 
give Bill Gates nightmares, sharing data and instructions over a whole 
planetary net.

2. Power is everywhere. From Mr Fusion (tm) to radio signals, to power grids 
in every road and floor, to thermal power and solar power.

Now, to take advantage of this, I design a TL11 robot. I want it to handle 
complex instructions, and perform large and intrictate stuff, like build a 
home or make a tunnel. I could put a Mr Fusion plant and large complex 
copmuter in it. But why do i need to? All I need to do is put an equivelent 
of a Network Computer, able to take large amout of data 
(visiual,tactile,sensor,audio,direct data feed) and send it to a computer 
dedicated to process data for robots. (Companies may set themselves up 
toprovide this as a service, like ISP today, or you can have a central 
computer for your own copreations robots, or even your personal comp which 
has processing space spare). I do not need power, as I can draw more than 
enough from the local power grid, even if it was 2km away (for longer 
distances I may need a radio booster and fusion pack, but for the example 
this robot stays in areas serviced by the computer and power nets).

So , all i need is a small power converter, a relatively small computer and 
a chasie. I then add what i deed, servo\'s for movement and manipulation, 
sensors, output devices and whatever tools i need (plasma torches, earth 
moving equipment, drills, whatever).

So , In a normal TL11 enviromets, robots are a real cheap proposition, low 
cost to build, great value for money, extreamly veritile, easy to program 
(all you need is a HTML like hook > I need to do this...get the insrtuctions 
from here...do task).

It would also make a design sequence laughingly simple. basic computer, 
servoes, power box, and add what we need on it.

Comments , Flames?

is to note that QSDS power plants contain fuel for only 6 months, not 1 year.

Since starships will ordinarily refuel after every jump, the duration is not
expected to be a major concern.  Designers should install twice the listed

I think it\'s reasonable to assume the table takes into account normal 
medical care for the given tech level.  I\'d never classify anagathics as 
normal medical care, so that (and things like it) would not be included.  

Here\'s a look at another possible aging table, based on the same 6-term 
interval premise that my original post was based upon.  The following 
three tables should give folks enough data to see what we\'re working with 
here.  While they take into account TL effects, social standing effects 
would be separate die modifiers.  

Each roll is for a possible 1 point loss this time.  The amount of points 
lost per term doesn\'t vary under this system.   The likelihood of losing 
points is the only thing that changes.  Same effect, different mechanism.

Once again, just like last time, in the first two Intervals only STR, 
DEX/AGI, and CON would be rolled for.  In subsequent Intervals, INT would 
be included in that.  

This system seems to give TL 0-1 people a break, but it doesn\'t.  
Although people living at TL 0-1 conditions may live to be more than 80 
years old, they probably do not.  Why?  When they get down to 1-2 point 
characteristics, in that environment they will probably be killed by 
unnatural means (ie, animals, rival tribes, etc.).

When figuring the amount of usable space aboard, it says to multiply the

to the internal structure of the ship.

Example:  200mt/2800m3 streamlined Box at 1G, TL12 (Factor .77) gives a
number of .77.  If this is then multiplied by the ships mass or volume, it
seems like an awful lot of space is lost for structure.  If it is instead
used to determine how much space is left, why do higher tech levels have
smaller numbers?

I\'m sure I\'m missing something essential, but the text wasn\'t overly clear.

I think you have misunderstood.  In CT the cost of running passengers was
2000cr for every mid  and high passenger.  I just assume that half of that
figure goes to pay for taxes rather than supplies.  The ship owner still
brings in the same net income.

For example, lets say a 100 ton ship has 32 tons that can be used for profit.  

	If used to carry non speculative cargo net income would be 32,000 credits.

	If used to carry low passengers net income would be 56,960 credits
(assuming a surviving low passenger wins the low lottery every jump).

	If used to carry mid passengers net income would be 48,000 credits.

	If used to carry high passengers net income would be 62,000 credits.
(Assuming there is already a stateroom for the steward, otherwise net income
would be 56,000).

	If this ship were to travel between two high population worlds of about
equal tech level it would always be assured of getting at lest eight high
passengers.  To carry anything but high passengers would mean loss of profit.

	If all 32 tons are used to carry cargo the owner would bring in 32,000
credits (assuming full bays) on each jump.  If the 32 tons were used for low
berths, 64 of them, net income would be 56,960 credits

True.  I was envisioning a product like Deluxe Traveller - boxed, with 
the sheets included in that.  But IG hasn\'t told us it has plans for such 
a product, so you\'re right.  It would have to be separate.

That would work, but only for one form, right?  

Sounds like we\'re back to bent spines again. <sigh>

That\'d certainly help those of us who are on line . . . :)

Paul,

I don\'t use the task system, so I hadn\'t even thought about that aspect.  
You\'re right, there definitely is a place for a Charisma characteristic.  
None of the basic six characteristics can be credibly stretched to cover 
that area.

Hmmm.  If IG doesn\'t have a Charisma characteristic in T4, that might be 
a good candidate for a house rule.

I am running a new one but it has too many people in it already!  There

Just got the latest Traveller Chronicle in the mail. If you are a fan of the
New Era, you should definately grab it (ducking the thrown produce from fans
of other eras).

The cover article and the bulk of the issue is for TNE Solomnai Rim. There\'s
an overview, collapsed stats and the like. Another article that I enjoyed a
lot was comparing actual stars with the stars in the Solomani Rim sourcebook.
Amusing little statements like "I had to juice up star x to make it fit the
stats in Harshman\'s original writing), etc. Plus other articles to round out
the issue and even some stuff by Mr. BITS-himself, A. Lilly.

The next issue (and it sounds like a few beyond that) will continue the
emphasis on the Rim.

Hmmm.  It seems to me he would still bring in the same gross income, but 
would get no profit from that.  If you charge 2000 credits for passage, 
pay 1000 credits to the government (taxes), and pay another 1000 credits for 
repairs and supplies, that leaves nothing for profit.  

At least, that\'s how it seems to me.

I like this thread about alternate aging tables.  Many of my characters have
taken the plunge pass the forth term (I believe in skills over stats in many
situations) but the ideal that someone in a high tech society in an
occupation that demands fitness (military - police - etc) should not suffer
an aging loss at 34.  This brings up another concept - how about modifing
the aging roll due to occupation - especially true if a TL2 character joins
the Imperium Navy.

On the other hand - the GM should be careful since world TL refers to what a
world is able to produce.  Thus, if a character\'s home world is TL 2 - it
may mean that his parents are living on a colony or science station.  As
such - he would have access to some of finest medical care available.

I\'ve got a few questions regarding the QSDS system.

1)  When you choose a hull, you get the stats for tonnes displacement,
power, cost, volume, etc.  However, when you calculate volume for the USD,
do you use the \'volume\' in the hull table, or do you multiply the td by 14?
If it\'s the latter, then what is the point of the volume in the hull table.

2)  What does \'len\' mean in the BIGHULLS text?

3)  I missed the message announcng the change that QSD 1.2 has, what exactly
is the difference between 1.1 and 1.2?

4)  Say, for example, I have a 5000 td ship, with a power plant giving off
3000 MW.  To get the power rating, is this correct:

3000 x 2 = 6000 \\ 5000 = 1.2 (The Power Rating is 1.2?)

A boxed product would be excellent, cause then the forms would be easy to
make.  Actually, what they could do in a boxed set is include the main
Traveller book, some other stuff (any ideas?) and some A4 size card which
has the different forms on (double-sided), so if I wantt o photocopy them
it\'s not a loose piece of paper I can loose, but a solid strong piece of
card which is easy to photocopy and hard to damage.

Lampchops Playhouse...  Cute versions though.

Here\'s a topic for speculation.  What was Margret doing pushing back into 
the Glimmer Drift like that?

Was she:

1) Pulling out.
2) Searching for new markets.
3) Trying to establish a secondary base she could fall back to.
or
4) Just looking for a really good hotdog at a reasonable price.

Perhaps something like the TNE boxed set, which included FF&S (a good supplement
regardless of how detailed you wanted to run your campaign).  Besides forms, the
T4 boxed set might possibly include the eventual soft-cover release of T4,
Milieu 0, and maybe even Starships or the Central Supply Catalog.  Much more
than that and it would be too expensive for most people.

It wouldn\'t even have to be IG... just someone with some time and IG\'s
permission.  But I *definitely* like the idea of having certain forms available
on line, since "permission to photocopy" such forms would mean that there would
be little money to be lost in such an endevor (except for what IG would want to
charge for the original forms).

    'body' => '  I\'ve read in SF of three processes for achieving extended life
  artificially (i.e., not evolving into it, and not considering
  brain transplants into robots, or downloading oneself into the
  net).

  First, is the Anagathic.  This is the method used in Traveller,
  and in the _Cities_in_Flight_ novels by James Blish.  Using this
  method, there is a regimen of drugs that are taken that
  counteract the physical effects of aging.  I disfavor life
  extension through this method because (a) the drugs themselves
  must be incredibly complex, to ensure that any side effects of
  screwing around with certain physiological processes are
  counteracted - and this still means that the subject is taking a
  _hell_ of a lot of stuff; (b) the brain chemistry problem - the
  so-called blood/brain barrier _has_ to continue to exist -
  otherwise, you\'re gonna come across some sort of nasty bug that
  exploits the same mechanism that your anagathic does, and that\'s
  when you first find out what trouble is; (c) logically, it must
  be unavailable (legally) to the PCs, or else it must be so common
  that _everybody_ can get them.  This is because if the supply is
  limited, it will be scarfed up "at any price" by those who have
  the most money - like the Imperial Family, and the families that
  control the biggest MegaCorps.  They\'ll hoard the stuff against a
  possible future shortage, and the entire output will be spoken
  for before it\'s produced.  If this isn\'t the case, then it must
  be because the production level is so high, and there are so many
  producers, that it becomes simple to locate the stuff, and the
  likelihood of running out and being unable to get the next dose
  is slim to none - and slim may just have left town.  Anything
  in-between results in the hoarding scenario; the only thing
  varying availability will affect is _which_ rich nobles with lots
  of pull are going to be able to get it.  Your typical PC isn\'t
  going to have a chance, without having something _real_ nasty to
  use as blackmail - or something _real_ big to use as a bribe.

  The second method is the \\deus ex machina\\.  The "canonical"
  example to me is Niven\'s _A_World_Out_Of_Time_.  In this method,
  you have what is essentially a very selective matter transmitter
  that simply poofs away all of the accumulated crud collectively
  known as products of aging, allowing the body to go back to
  functioning at full efficiency for the next seventy years or so.
  Now, \'splain to me how a brainless machine can distinguish the
  "crud" from the same chemicals serving a useful purpose in a
  living body - that stuff\'s gotta come from somewhere...  This
  doesn\'t work for me.

  The third and final method is represented in a book called
  _Buying_Time_, author disremembered.  The basic theory here is
  that they clone almost everything - organs, skin, muscle, et
  cetera, and then rebuild you practically from the ground up.
  The process requires a noticeable chunk of time, and a large team
  of medical professionals specifically trained in the process.
  There\'s also a significant amount of near-continuous pain, and
  since you\'ve got to be conscious for some parts of the process,
  there is mental trauma as well.  So, in order to ensure that you
  come out of the process as sane as you went in, there is a
  treatment that "wipes", or perhaps suppresses, your memories of
  the process.  In the story, it starts out being an exclusive
  process (monopolistic supply), and the cost is every bit of your
  wealth and assets - and you\'d better have at least a million
  bucks just to walk in the door.  There are also covenants and
  investigations designed to ensure that you\'re not hiding any
  wealth, and you\'re not allowed to buy the job for someone else.
  What\'s more, there\'s a booby-trap designed into the system;
  you\'ll need a refresher in a relatively short time (10 years?) or
  you\'ll be turned off.  By the end of the story, the process has
  been duplicated except for the mindwipe, so it becomes a flat fee
  job - a million gets it with no booby-trap (you\'ll be good for
  50-100 years at a shot, not just 10), and who cares where the
  million comes from as long as the cops ain\'t gonna be knocking at
  the doc\'s door later. I like this one - it\'s not out of reach for
  the average astute PCs, but it\'ll be tough to scrape up the cash
  for the ticket - unless they do some rich bastard a favor, and he
  offers to pay for the job. Further, there\'s a cost to the PC that
  takes it, even beyond the cash - do you really want to be totally
  out of circulation for several months?  If the number of
  suppliers is limited enough, getting there might be an adventure
  or three, even if you\'ve got the cash, and they might charge the
  high (surrender \'em and come out broke) price - is it worth it,
  and are your buddies gonna be there when you come out, and is
  there a covenant forcing you to sever the relationship to get the
  job done?  Then, how long\'s the waiting list, and if you\'ve got
  something terminal (cancer?), are you gonna last long enough to
  go in (you\'ll come out cured - and that includes cured of genetic
  nasties like diabetes, tay-sachs, sickle-cell, and so on)?  A
  nice feature of this is that it becomes available at relatively
  low tech levels - say 9 or 10 (maybe even 8, but I think that\'s
  pushing it) - with the process perhaps taking six months to a
  year (no mindwipe, so gotta do it slowly to prevent
  psychotrauma), not including cloning lead time, shortening down
  to maybe a month at TL 15, with no lead time needed.

  I think I\'m going to go with the surgical "anagathic" in my
  Traveller universe; the pharmaceuticals will exist, but they\'ll
  essentially be the dangerous Ana-B of T:TNE, with its nasty side
  effects (I seem to remember that Ana-A, the "good" one, also had
  some nasty side effects, as well).  A PC who plays his cards
  right can live from the rediscovery of the technique in the
  Sylean Federation right through to the Assassination.  Could make
  for an interesting campaign...  "Heh, you think this is a tough
  war; _I_ remember during the Pacification of Antares, we...
  (said by Command Sergeant Major "Wheezer" Geezer, during the
  Fifth Frontier War).

  For playing this, the character ages normally, but when he comes
  out of the process, go back to the stats that the player
  originally rolled up, and roll 1D3 against each - on a 1, lower
  the stat by 1, on a 2, no change, on a 3, raise the stat by 1.
  Don\'t do this with social standing, and don\'t pay any pensions
  from previous careers after release.  The character is now on the
  Age 18 line of the aging tables, and may resume adventuring
  immediately (if properly equipped, contacts, et cetera), or may
  embark on a new "prior career".  Prior possessions, cash, TAS
  membership, et cetera, depend on the payment plan in your
  universe.  One caveat on payment - it should be _very_ expensive,
  even if it\'s not the "all assets" plan, and no credit or payment
  plan should be extended. Payment, in full, must be made up front
  as a condition of admission.

    'body' => 'Joe Walsh\'s comments about taxation, and David Broussard\'s analysis
of the size and cost of the Imperial Navy got me to pondering...(are
you ponering what I\'m pondering, Pinky?? I don\'t know Brain...just
how DO you get an Aslan to play the Cowardly Lion???)

What is the population base we\'re talking about here?  Where did the
grand \'11,000 Worlds of the Imperium\' number come from?

So I applied a massive overkill of technology (Sybase Sys 10 on a HP
workstation, using expensive client-server applications...but hey,
at least this way I can say I WAS working...ummmm Yeah! "I\'m testing
the integrity of our network"; that\'s it!) and put all of the fabled
\'Genie sector data\' into a database. Now we can play with the
nnumbers in some useful sort of way.

CAVEAT: As has been mentioned here, and elsewhere much of the Genie
data is probably non-canon, and moreover, seems to have been created
with \'a computer with it\'s needle stuck\' (Dave Nillson, in the last
Challenge, regarding collapsing systems...this was a sidebar,
actually). Furthermore, some of the data is incomplete. For
instance, the much of the Vland sector is missing the population
multiplier; I substituted a default of 1, so some population
estimates could be as much as 90% off  in a worst case scenario.
Also, I don\'t know when the Allegiance code corresponds to
(Pre-Rebellion, Rebellion, other?) I made the assumption here that
it was just Pre-Rebellion. Finally, these data don\'t specify the
number of inhabited worlds in the system, so I\'m assuming one
world/system, and all the population lives there. From a
fine-grained standpoint this is a horrible idea, but for what I\'m
doing I think it\'s perfectly fine.

On to the data:

Sectors included: 32

Ley, Core, Deneb, Spica, Verge, Vland, Daibei, Delphi, Lishun,
Magyar, Antares, Fornast, Hlakhoi, Corridor, Diaspora, Iwahfuah,
Gushemege, Massillia, Ealiyasiyw, Dagudashaag, Dark Nebula, Reft
Sector, Staihaia Yo, Alpha Crucis, Hinterworlds, Solomani Rim,  Old
Expanses, Empty Quarter, Trojan Reaches, Riftspan Reaches, Spinward
Marches, and Glimmerdrift Reaches

Total number of Worlds: 13,410

Total number of Worlds, by Allegiance

	Allegiance	Number of Systems 
	 Im	7026	 
	 As	1896 	
	 Na	1293
 	 So	1058 	
	Dd	326
 	 Ma	261
 	 Li	258
 	 Cs	177
 	 Hv	177 
	 Va	113
 	 Jr	80

	 	These are the major ones, there are a number of other codes
present in the data that I don\'t recognize.  Hell, I don\'t recognize
all of these! (Someone help please?)

It\'s clear, though, that the Imperium consists of slightly fewer
than 11,000 worlds, by  about 36%!

On to populations:

Using the numbers here, the total population of the Imperium is as
follows:

Total Population		28,051,512,234,733
average population		3,992,529,495
		Std.dev	14,914,515,513

Number of Worlds	UWP Pop figure
536	10
323	9
470	8
606	7
621	6
732	5
711	4
596	3
506	2
403	1
1520	0

There are 536 worlds with a population greater than 10 billion!

So now, David\'s  numbers of 5,625,000,000 MCr in ships, and
160,000-4,400,000 MCr per Month on Salaries can be put into real
taxation terms.

Naval crew sizes. 

	David estimates that under MT rules, the Navy has
crewing requirements of 120 to 1120 million members. These figures
are .0004% to .004% of the total population. If we extend this to
(roughly) current US populations, that would give us a Navy staffing
of just over a thousand to just under 10,000 people. This is a very
small part of the population. 

Naval ships (excepting, of course, in times of war) last a long
time. I\'ll be very conservative, and estimate 20 years. (This is
probably much shorter_after all; standard ship purchase contracts
are 40 year mortgages) That puts annual capital expenses at
281,250,000 MCr/year. 

	 I\'ll pick the middle figure for crewing requirements, 2,280,000
MCR/mo or 27,360,000 MCr/year. This gives a total funding figure for
the Navy for capital ships and crew alone as 308,610,000 MCr / year. 

That means the average Imperial citizen pays (let me check my number
of zeros, here) 77,296 Cr annually for the munificent protection of
the Imperial Navy. 

	It\'s quite possible that one or more of us is off by a significant 
number of decimal places.  I\'ll have to recheck my figures and see; 
but I am pretty confident of those population figures.

	In a later post I\'ll break down the populations of the major 
factions, (if someone can tell me what all the %#@$# allegiance codes 
are?)

I know that Dave and Guy("Derek") have been working their backsides off
trying to cobble togther a worthwhile design system virtually overnight,
and I admire them for it.

Unfortunately, I\'ve come up with yet another mismatch between the QSDS
and the SSDS: lasers.  I cannot make any of the laser weapons in the
SSDS duplicate a standard civilian battery.  Power is the worst: it
seems that the batteries from QSDS require about 5 to 10 times the power
of any weapon listed in QSDS.  For example, the basic TL-11 civilian
battery (listed as containing one weapon) has a USD battery value of
1-0-0-0, so will the 72 MJ TL-11 laser.  The volumes are the same (a
standard 42 m^3 / 3 ton turret).  The power in QSDS is 11 MW; the power
in SSDS is 2 MW.  Since this is the only TL-11 light laser turret in the
SSDS, it would seem necessary for compatibility that this is the weapon
which comprises the civilian battery in QSDS.

Also, several of the batteries in QSDS refer to multiple weapons,
whereas there is no mention of mounting multiple weapons in a single
turret in SSDS.  Are triple turrets allowed or not?  If not, the QSDS
needs to replace the number of weapons with a remark that the weapon is
rapid-fire, which increases the effectiveness.  If so, the SSDS needs to
explain how to do so.

Derek mentioned to me that the electronics packages do not contain
precisely the same equipment between the two systems, either.

I think we need to have a large outcry to Imperium Games that the
philosophy behind the QSDS and SSDS (and whatever the revised FF&S will
be called) was that SSDS is a simplification of FF&S, QSDS is a
simplification of SSDS.  Every component in each system should be
exactly reproducible with the next more complex system.  I should be
able to work out the numbers for structure, armor, life support,
controls, air locks, artificial gravity, inertial compensation,
contra-gravity lifters, and fuel scoops with the SSDS and exactly
replicate (within round-off error in the last decimal place) a hull
given in the QSDS.  

** If the systems as they exist now do not uphold this philosophy, then
they should be fixed! **  

I realize it\'s far too late to get any corrections into the main
rulebook.  Perhaps an errata sheet can be ready in time to be shipped
with the books?  I will, however, gladly wait an extra month (or two)
for the starships supplement if it\'s RIGHT when I finally get it.  And
for those who desire the extra level of detail which causes them to buy
the starships supplement, some errata on the QSDS might be in order.

The only problem with that is it\'s getting quite expensive already:

$25 - Softcover T4
$20 - Starships\\Central Supply Catalog
$20 - Milieu 0
$10? - Forms

That adds up to $75!!!  Now, take into effec that normally buying things in

$50!!  at least.  Perhaps the Starships\\CSC can be cut, that\'d lower the

How could they charge for the original form is it\'s online?  Am I

    'body' => 'OK, so based on Steve Bonneville and Wildstar\'s estimates, the Imperium is 
bringing in 2 quadrillion credits (2,000,000,000,000,000 Cr for you UK types) 
per year for military funding.  This is 1% of the combined Gross Planetary 
Product of the worlds of the Imperium.  Of this, by David Broussard\'s 
calculations, the Imperial Navy is spending 5 trillion credits 
(5,000,000,000,000 Cr) per month on military salaries, or 60 trillion 
(60,000,000,000,000) per year.

David\'s estimates put the value of the Imperium\'s Capital ships at 3.75 
Quadrillion Cr (3,750,000,000,000,000) and the value of the Imperial Navy\'s 
fighters and non-jump warships at 2.5 quadrillion cr (2,500,000,000,000,000 
cr).  I would estimate the cost of the Imperial Navy\'s auxilliaries and 
facilities would come in about the same as the captial ships; another 3.75 
Quadrillion Cr (3,750,000,000,000,000).  Altogether, this would be 10 
Quadrillion Cr (10,000,000,000,000,000 cr) 
I would expect that operating and maintenance expenses would come in at 1% of 
total value per month, which would be 100 trillion credits (100,000,000,000,000 
cr), or 1.2 quadrillion credits (1,200,000,000,000,000 cr) per year.  Overall, 
the Imperium would be spending 105 trillion credits (105,000,000,000,000 cr) 
per month, or 1.26 quadrillion credits (1,260,000,000,000,000 cr) per year on 
maintaining the Imperial Navy and Marines.  That would leave about 740 trillion 
credits (740,000,000,000,000 cr) for the acquisition of new naval vessels and 
facilities, or for major overheal of same.

Assuminmg the Imperial Army is not just a skeleton force used to command 
drafted army units from Imperial worlds, I would suspect that the Imperial Army 
would need another 5 trillion credits (5,000,000,000,000 Cr) per month for 
salaries, and probably would have 2.5 quadrillion cr (2,500,000,000,000,000 cr) 
woth of equipment or facilities of their own (a guess based on US 
Navy/Marine/Air Force costs compared to US Army costs).  If handled like the 
Imperial Navy costs, this would mean monthly Army expenditures of 
30,000,000,000,000 cr, or an annual cost of 360,000,000,000,000; a real bargain 
compared to the Navy.

So, if you are getting 2,000,000,000,000,000 in taxes and spending 
1,620,000,000,000,000 on maintaining the military, you have 380,000,000,000,000 
left to buy new equipment, fund the rest of the Empire and expend largesse on 
the masses.  Or is the tax noted above only for military?

How do you suppose people view the Rule of Man in Mileu 0?

I think we have two potential models here.  The first, from Terran history, 
would be the awe and reverence that the Roman Empire was held in by the 
societies of Dark Ages Europe.  Nobody blamed the lack of long-distance trade 
or the suppression of finer art, culture and education on the Romans; the 
empire was seen as a good time that might be recaptured.  Many of the larger 
groups and organizations tried to use bits and pieces of Roman culture to make 
themsleves more appealing and acceptable.  For an example of this, look at the 
Catholic Church or some of the unification efforts like the Holy Roman Empire.  
The HRE was not holy, was nowhere near Rome and was a fairly pathetic excuse 
for an empire, but by taking on the mantle of imperial Rome the HRE was able to 
be much more successful than it would have been without that name recognition.

The second model comes from GDW.  In all of their Reformation Coalition 
material, the Imperium was seen as a bad and evil thing.  The collapse of 
civilization and trade, and the ruin and general decay of the former Imperium, 
was blamed on the imperials and their blunders.  I suspect that the Regency was 
not going to face much of a military problem from the Reformation Coalition, 
but its association with the Imperium was probably going to cause it a lot of 
problems in trying to assimilate areas that had spent the last 80+ years hating 
the Imperium.

I _think_ the first model is more likely for Mileu 0, just based on what little 
canon references are out there about that period.  I\'m sure some worlds will 
tend more towards the second model and require a more militant effort to become 
part of the Imperium, but by and large I think most worlds will be enticed by 
the economic potential involved in a new Imperium, and join in with only a 
little persuasion (little being a relative term here; we are talking about 
whole subsectors and sectors of people).

This question brings up another important question:  Why are the Syleans 
expanding?   I suspect that it is largely an economic reason; expansion = new 
and bigger markets and wealth for all.  This is all very nice, but it is hard 
to sell a long-term campaign of expansion by promising a better standard of 
living.  So maybe the question here is actually "How is the Sylean government 
explaining this expansion to its own people?"

One idea I may wind up using (depending on whats in the Mileu 0 sourcebook, of 
course) might be a quasi-crusade to unite humanity under one government.  If 
you have read The Mote in God\'s Eye (or Jerry Pournelle\'s other 
Codominium/Imperium books), there was something similar in that series.  The 
preious Empire had been torn apart in a civil war that started when independent 
states fielded fleets and began arming separatists in the Empire.  Now that the 
Empire is reforming, the government and Navy has become very fanatical about 
controlling ALL human worlds, so that such a civil war cannot happen again.

Anybody got some other ideas?

That\'s the problem with those systems----given enough time, they can be

Actually 11000 worlds makes a fair amount of sense..if every subsector had
25 inhabitable worlds, and the Imperium spanned 20 sectors, then the
Imperium would have 8000 inhabitable (inhabited) systems.  Those numbers
are completely off the cusp...maybe someone with more sourcebooks could
give a statistically more accurate view...

I\'m not saying TNE is a model of success, but the TNE boxed set I just 
purchased, with TNE, FF&S, and some misc. charts in it was $46.00.  So, 
if the price could get down to $50, perhaps it isn\'t an unreasonable 
amount.

Then again, I\'m so out of touch with present-day RPg prices (TNE is the 
first RPG non-supplement I\'ve purchased in several years), what do I 
know? :)

(Don\'t let this get into Traveller!)  Scientific American ran an article
some months back that said that the genome researchers may be getting
close to isolating the gene for aging.  If I can find the article I will
post more info on it...(gaack.  Welcome to 30 term characters, yikes.)

        QSDS armor factors aren\'t the same as FF&S armor factors, although
they\'re derived. For the new combat system we needed to generate something
similar to the old Universal Ship Profile, called a Universal Ship
Description. Take the FF&S armor factor, use the BR conversion chart, then
multiply by 10 to get the USD factor. FF&S armor of less than 20 comes out
as USD 0.

        "Under Volume Factor, find the column for the tech level, and find
the row for the displacement. Multiply the number there by the maximum Gs to
determine the amount of hull volume (in m3) that is dedicated to the
internal structure of the ship."

        Take the volume factor (0.77), and multiply by the maximum Gs (1),
and you get 0.77m3. Don\'t multiply by ship\'s mass or volume ... everything
is built into the volume factor except Gs.

        Wrong. None of these are addressed to the list MANAGER ... they\'re
all addressed to the LIST. Send a message to "majordomo@mpgn.com" with the

        PS: Most mailing lists work this way ... anything sent to the list

saving such useful information.

Before I get to your comments, I want to mention something I forgot 
about when making previous posts:

The only way the sort of radical aging system change we\'re proposing can 
work without upsetting play balance (IMO) is if the survival throws are 
kept...or some other factor is introduced in character generation to keep 
players from generating 100-year-old characters with every skill under 
the sun and having another 100 years to adventure.  

Now, on to the reply:

Hmmm.  I\'d really hate for the aging system to become so realistic it is 
impossibly complex, but what you\'re saying does make sense.  What do 
others think?  Where do we draw the line vis a vis modifiers to aging throws?

This is a sticky problem I\'ve been thinking about as well.  To me, the 
most relevant tech level in terms of what we\'re dealing with is the TL of 
the medicine and treatment the character has available throughout his/her 
life...not just at birth, not just while being generated, and not just 
while adventuring.

Here\'s one proposal:

Childhood:  Ignore it.  Any character generated should be supposed to be 
a healthy specimen.  Either they\'re one of the masses of healthy people 
from a medium-to-high tech world, or they\'re one of the few lucky ones to 
be healthy coming out of a low-tech world.

During Generation:  Use the TL of the Milieu if it\'s an Imperial job (ie, 
Scouts, Navy, Army, Mercenary, etc.) or a job with a lot of travel 
(Merchant, Entertainer, etc.).  If it\'s a generally stay-at-home 
character type (ie, street tough, starport police, etc.), then use the 
tech level of the environment (the referee will have to determine this).

When adventuring:  This one is going to be in the area of referee 
judgement.  It will depend on where the character goes, what he does, 
etc.  I\'d say use the predominant tech level experienced during the 
majority of the character\'s last four years.  If he spent two years in a 
stark prison cell with no medical facilities provided, use the TL 0-1 
row.  If he was hopping from world to world, using mostly Class A 
starports and whatnot, use the Milieu\'s max TL.  

What do you think?

>        (1) In the weapon section, under laser bays, the table labelled "50
displacement ton Laser Bays," in the text just above the actual table it
says "The rate of fire of any turret ..." This should read "The rate of fire

folding array (ship can\'t accelerate while deployed)"

between Basic and Standard life support. Suggest the following:

intended for short periods of time (up to about eight hours). Standard Life
Support provides the same, and adds waste disposal or recycling and food,

a bit of safety margin built in, and can be stretched to double its intended
load for twice as long."

be changed to read "Choose a meson screen from the chart. In the column
under the ship size category for your hull, note the protective value that
screen provides."

Wow.  I would have thought the population would be much higher.  The more 
I think about it, though, an average population of 4 billion (thousand 
million) per world makes sense.

And 1,520 worlds with a populatio of 0!  Surprising.  I always thought 
Traveller over-estimated the frequency of worlds well-suited to human 
habitation.

Aigh!  Considering the retirement pay scales, most citizens of the

        I\'m pretty sure about the laser tables, as I was able to reproduce
the "stock" weapons. As a rough approximation, a 72MJ discharge energy
translates to 360MJ input energy. Rate of Fire times Input Energy divided by
1800 is the power input required for the weapon: 2MJ.

        Not really ... why duplicate? If you\'ve already got it in QSDS...

        I don\'t know ... they weren\'t under FF&S, which was our basis. Each
of the turrets in SSDS only has ROOM for a single laser. An extension to
FF&S later may allow for multiple weapons.

        Well, not quite. SSDS is a simplification of FF&S, QSDS is an even
greater simplification; not necessarily derived directly from SSDS. However,
since they\'re both supposed to be derived from FF&S, they should be compatible.

        Agreed simply because both are based on FF&S, but why would you want
to?If it\'s already available in QSDS, there\'s no need to do it under SSDS.

Me, too.  And the folks at IG.

Yes.  

If it is true that there are incompatabilities and errors (and I\'m not 
the one to judge that...I fell in love with QSDS and just haven\'t had the 
impetus to download SSDS and work with a second system), they should be 
fixed.  I\'m not implying anything about your abilities, William, by the 
way.  It\'s just that there have been several messages pointing out 
problems with the sytem (including at least one from me!) that turned out 
not to be problems with the systems, but with people\'s understanding of 
the systems.

Again, I am not pointing fingers and crying when I didn\'t do 
anything to help in this process.  I appreciate the efforts of David and 
Guy very very much...especially since they did it for the love of the 
game, not for money.  But I love this game, too, and I want very much for 
it to be the best it can possibly be.  After all my hyping of the game to 
everyone who will listen, I\'d hate for it to be an embarassment. (not 
that anyone else wants that!)

Again, /if it is true that there are serious problems in compatability 
between the three systems/:

Since it is too late to get the corrections into the main rulebook, 
which contains QSDS, perhaps the best course would be to make QSDS the 
standard, and back out the changes into SSDS and FF&S /where possible/.  
That would limit the errata, at least.

[Sigh]  There just wasn\'t enough time . . .

David? Guy?  Are there indeed problems of compatability?  If so, what can 
be done?

I had always understood the Rule of Man (AKA the Ramshackle Empire) was 
looked on with disdain by quite a number of people.  This leads me to 
believe there would be more resistance to a new Imperium...

Oooh.  Interesting.  From my knowledge of history (which is, admittedly, 
limited), I\'d say convincing the population that expansion of their 
territory is a good thing wouldn\'t be difficult.  Convincing others to 
join would be for some, not for others, on a case-by-case basis, however.

	You ask what possessed me to do all of that work.  Well, first off I am
just starting up a Rebellion game on Sunday using MT rules (hopefully
easier to transition to T4), and I plan to have Pirates figure prominently
in the beginning to allow some time for the news to bypass the characters,
and let the Solomoni Invasion forces reach the edge of the Diaspora
Sector.  I need about 6-18 months by my calculations.  I needed a good
idea of the relative strengths of the Imp Navy in the Solomoni Rim, and
elsewhere.

The second reason was that someone had mentioned thousands of Tigress
class dreadnoughts running around, and at first glance that number seemed
awfully high, after my calculations, it now seems about right (but just
for that class).  It also fit in with the taxation thread.

Lastly I was hoping that it might finally kill the Virus line, Please,
Please, Please...we all have the points, now is the time to agree to
disagree.

Ah, that\'s why I couldn\'t find it. :)  I downloaded the RTF one.  
Hopefully that will work (I downloaded it to my space on my ISP\'s 
machine...I\'m on the Atari right now, and that 800K file isn\'t going to 
fit into its 256K memory:).  I\'ll load it into WP 6.0a this weekend and 
see what happens.

Yep.  All the stuff that\'s come out of the taxation thread has been

In an article on Call of Cthulhu, writer Kevin Jones mentions Traveller

It seems Traveller is still the archetypical Sci-Fi RPG.  This bodes well

I emailed Shadis (shadis2@aol.com) asking them whether they had plans to

I suppose it isn\'t, in American dollars (which incidently, the prices are
in), but for me, living in Canada something that\'s $50 American can
translate into $65!  Which, is quite a lot really.  I think the  Rule book,
Forms, and Mileu 0 would be a fine boxed set though.

Well, going with current AD&D prices, to get the basic game that we\'re
suggesting with the T4 boxed set costs the following:

(prices are Canadian, they\'re the only ones I know)

Dungeon Master\'s Guide -- $25
Player\'s Handbook -- $25
Monstrous Manual -- $25
Character Sheets -- $12
Arms & Equipment Guide (the most similar thing to CSC I could think of) -- $20
[Any Campaign Setting] - $40

That equals around $150!!!  So maybe $50 for Traveller isn\'t too much :)

That sounds like an ROF thing to me.  Remember, weapons that operate at ROF
10 get a -1 to USD factor.  To avoid this, the "standard" civilian weapons
in QSDS run at ROF 50 (no USD modification) and ROF 100 (+1 USD) - with the
consequent increased power drain.

The QSDS weapon is a TL-11 80MJ laser, similar to (actually, fudged from)
the "standard" Brilliant Lances TL-11 socket laser.  It runs at ROF 50 
to avoid becomeing a 0-0-0-0 weapon.  The weapon has a base power draw of
2.2 MW (at ROF 10), so at ROF 50, draws 11MW.

I assume the SSDS weapon is a more efficiently-designed laser; the SSDS
weapon designs were not available to me when I was putting together QSDS.

They\'re _allowed_, but they\'re not very smart.  The multiple-weapon
batteries in QSDS all have one weapon per turret (the volume and surface
area figures are correct for the number of turrets required), with up to 10
turrets per battery.

Unfortunately, that\'s not so.  QSDS and SSDS were developed in parallel from
FF&S, both are simplifications of FF&S, but neither one is based on the
other.  There was enough communication between Dave and I that (I hope) we
got all of the deviations from FF&S in sync.

This means, though, that QSDS is _not_ a proper subset of SSDS.  I
originally wrote it as an alternative to SSDS, because I thought that SSDS
was too complicated.  Don decided that QSDS had enough promise to go into
the main rulebook, and that suddenly tightened the deadline, so that I had
to "finish" many parts of QSDS (such as electronics and weapons) without
benefit of waiting a few days for the corresponding SSDS components to be
done.

Yes, you should.  You\'ll probably have trouble getting weapons and
electronics to agree, however.

I will maintain QSDS errata, and intend to continue to support the system.
However, withg the exception of two known errors (see below), I believe
that QSDS 1.2 can be duplicated by FF&S, and so is "correct".  As is
SSDS - however, different design decisions were made in the two systems, so
thay may not exactly match each other.

Known QSDS Errata:
1) Power Plant fuel consumption is in error.  The listed value is for 6
   months, not twelve.  Install twice the listed fuel to achieve a 1 year
   duration.
2) Power Plant surface area is suprious.  Ignore power plant sufrace area.
   This errror also exists in SSDS.

A QSDS "civilian" laser operates with a ROF of 100 or less, and does not
have a MFD included with the battery (and thus, can only have one turret -
and one weapon - per battery).

QSDS "military" weapons include MFDs, and are ROF 100 or higher (ROF 800
when available), and may be installed in batteries of up to 10 turrets.

That\'s for ROF 10, when gets you a -1 to the USD.  If the laser does 20
points of damage (right), then the USD of the weapon would be 0-0-0-0 if
it\'s installed with ROF 10.  Install it with ROF 50 (10MW) to get 1-0-0-0.

QSDS and SSDS are _compatible_ with one another, but one is not a subset of
the other.  Both are subsets of FF&S.

There are now several different armor scales running around.  The "Armor
Rating" in the USD display (and given in the QSDS tables) is different
(but derived from) the FF&S Armor.

A ship must have _FF&S_ armor equal to it\'s G-rating times 10 to withstand
micro-meteors.  For 1G ships, this translates to a USD Armor Rating of 0 (2G
and 3G ships get a USD Armor Rating of 10).

USD Armor Ratings are always multiples of 10.  The USD Armor Rating is
calculated by converting the FF&S armor value using the conversion table
supplied with SSDS, and multiplying the result by 10.


Tom Miller <scouse@inforamp.net> asked:

The \'volume\' on the hull table is the usable volume left inside the hull
(after the space required by armor, life-support, artificial gravity,
airlocks, and contra-grav equiment).  In other words, the volume left that
you can put things into.

All of the things you might want to put into the hull also have a \'volume\'
characteristic.  Your design fits into the hull if all of these volumes add
up to less than (or exactly equal to) the \'volume\' listed in the hull table.

The USD volume is a separate thing entirely.  It\'s the Tons of the hull
multiplied by 14.  It\'s there because of a philosophical difference: QSDS
uses displacement tons as a convenient unit of volume, and generally ignores
cubic meters.  SSDS and FF&S use cubic meters (and generally ignore
displacement tons).  Therefore the USD has to show both; it was a bad choice
to use the word "Volume" in both senses, but I couldn\'t think of a better
alternative.

> 2)  What does \'len\' mean in the BIGHULLS text?

That\'s the length of the hull, in meters.  I thought you\'d like to know.

If you ever want to install a spinal mount, or certain sensors (neither of
which are included in QSDS, but you could design them with FF&S), you\'ll
need to know the length of the hull.

> 3)  I missed the message announcng the change that QSD 1.2 has, what exactly
> is the difference between 1.1 and 1.2?

I goofed up on the Thrust Plate table.  The power required is far too low; I
gave it as 1Mw per displacement ton, and it should be 1Mw per cubic meter
(which is 14Mw per displacement ton - the error was caused by that DT/m3
thing again).  To "fix" QSDS 1.1, multiply the Thrust Plate power numbers by
14.  Yes, this is a serious error.

There are two known errors in QSDS 1.2 (they will be fixed with v1.3):
1) The power plant fuel was calculated incorrectly; the values given are for
   6 months duration (instead of the stated 1 year).  Install twice the
   listed value if you require a 1 year duration.
2) The power plant surface area requirements are spurious.  Ignore them.

> 4)  Say, for example, I have a 5000 td ship, with a power plant giving off

Yes.  You can also round to the nearest integer (1 would also be correct).
I suggest rounding to the nearest integer for numbers greater than 1, and
keeping the fractions (to one or two decimals) for numbers less than 1.

In general, USD Ratings can be rounded to the nearest integer; you also
don\'t have to include the leading zeros ("1" is fine, you don\'t need to list
"01"), or unused batteries (don\'t bother to list "00 Battery 0-0-0-0".

Finally, the number before the battery is the number of such batteries
installed on the ship, and _NOT_ the number of weapons in the battery.
Therefore, "2 Long-Range Laser 4-2-1-1" indicates that the ship has 2
independent long-range laser batteries, each of which has USD 4-2-1-1.
Similarly, a ship with 6 missile barbettes could have "1 Missile 30 (6)",
indicating that the barbettes are grouped into a single battery with 30
ready missiles, 6 of which can be controlled in-flight at once.  This gives
a larger swarm of missiles, which may survive defensive fire better.  The same
barbettes could be arranged as "2 Missile 15 (3)" - two batteries, each of
which have 15 missiles (and each battery can control 3 missiles in flight at
once).  This gives additional flexability.

A battery, no matter how many weapons are in it, is treated as a single
entity: it\'s controlled by one person, fires at one target, and and gets a
single "to-hit" roll.  In QSDS, batteries are generally designated when the
ship is built (or weapons are installed).  As an optional rule, ships that
have bridges installed may re-arrange their battery configuration at any
point, even in battle.

Shouldn\'t this be corndogs from the Hiver?

Really, though, this is a bit off topic, but I think its worth it.  I read
an article the other day, the city of New York has doubled the privelage
license fee on the guy that runs the Hot Dog Cart at the corner in front of
the Metropolitan Museum.  He now pays $288,000.00 IIRC (It was at least 200
thousand).  Talk about an expensive Hot Dog!!!!

About Margret.  I didn\'t get any MT material except the original boxed set
and the Referee\'s companion, and most of my Rebellion knowledge comes from
Survival Margin.  I was pulling for Margret to win when I first got the MT
boxed set, and then when I got Arrival Vengence (oh, yeah, I forgot I had
that), I realized that she was not going to win and she was portrayed as
something of a whimpy loner.  My guess was that she was trying to enlargen
(is that a word) her domain without stepping on anyone\'s feet.

Then there was virus and I think Virus was really...

Just kidding, put your guns away, I didn\'t bring my ballistic weave cloth vest!

        Aha! Then all the laser turrets in SSDS are "civilian" weapons until

        DOH! Oh well, all the weapons in SSDS are ROF10 *but* with the
caveat that you can increase the power to increase the ROF ... up to ROF100
there\'s no impact to volume or anything else.

The part of England conquered by the Vikings was called the Danelaw because
Danish law was in force there (ca. 700 A.D., I guess).  William the
Conqueror (1066) led a later Viking invasion of England -- it\'s just that
his Vikings had lived in Normandy for a few generations (the French having
given it or lost it to them).

This sort of layering also occurred throughout Traveller history.  The Rule
of Man imposed 25th Century Terran law on the Vilani system, etc.

these.  If not, well, here they are anyway.

In our discussions about legal systems we mostly talked about legal systems,
not legal cultures.  PCs of course deal with the culture directly.  For
example, in the United States and Western Europe, as well as in many other
places, people basically believe in the law.  That is, for example, if the
law says that the government must do X when someone presents it with
enumerated facts, the people expect that the government will either do X or
give a real explanation why not.  

In the former Soviet Union, as well as many other places, the rule is the
opposite.  Although the law may be very plain, government leaders do what
they want.  Thus in Belarus, the constitution provided that parliament would
serve for five years, and then there would be an election.  If a quorum of
voters didn\'t vote, parliament would continue to serve until a new election.
After five years, an election was held, and a quorum didn\'t vote.  The
president then declared that the parliament was sitting illegally (because
five years had elapsed), and directed executive agencies not to cooperate
with it.  This has led to an ongoing constitutional crisis, with large-scale
rioting and demonstrations.  

So in places like that, PCs would have to rely on blat or guanxi to get
things done.  Your cargo has been impounded, even though you had a permit to
bring it in? Maybe you should become friendly with A, whose uncle knows
someone in customs to whom someone in impound owes a favor.  Yes, take A out
to dinner.  Bring a suitable companion.

Me, too -- assuming that you mean character ages.  Players and referees have
varied in age from 17 to 40 (not with my own aging, either -- in the
campaign in which I sometimes play, the age range is 23 to 43; in the
campaign that I referee, my recurring player and I are both in our mid-30s).  

Moreover, I\'ve found that in real life the 30s are the age when energy and
ability are optimized -- people have had time to acquire the skills,
background, experience, and seasoning to take on challenges, the energy to
accept them, and the stamina to see them through.  In other words, it\'s the
perfect time to go adventuring.

Think about it... without the internet, somebody would have to create & print
the forms and include them inside the rulebook.  The cost of this would be
included in the price of the rulebook (however miniscule).  IG would then allow
you to make "copies" (for personal use only) at your own expense without any
threat regarding copyright infringement.

By creating a bunch of forms and making them available *only* on-line, IG could
never compensate for their time in creating these forms unless they charge
slightly more for their other products (or write it off as advertising  8-)

If the basic rulebook comes with a set of forms, *and* these forms are also
available on-line, then everything is fine (you paid for the original forms by
buying the main rulebook).  If not, IG will have to create a book of forms and
charge accordingly.

I know that *we* all know the answers to these questions (like # of spinal

Given a yearly budget of 3e14 Cr (300,000,000 MCr) and population of 
3e13 (28,000,000,000,000), the cost per Imperial subject is going 
to be 3e14/3e13, or 10 Cr.  I\'d multiply that by 10 to get a 
reasonable ball-park figure to account for all the support functions 
required.  This gives a figure consistent (on the same order of 
magnitude) with Striker and TCS for naval budgets.

Dry reading, I\'m sure. :)

1. At what TL does central nervous system regeneration become possible?
(e.g., repairing spinal cord or brain damage).

2. What\'s the densest substance one is reasonably likely to find in large 
natural deposits (uranium?)?

3. How intelligible would writing from before the Long Night be to the 
Syleans? (i.e., is it like Shakespearean english, or like Gaelic, or what?)

4. What is Helium 2, exactly, and does it pose any sort of threat when 
encountered?

Hah!  Now that should get you all wondering! :-)

	I\'ve been re-reading Survival Margin and the Virus section at the 
back.  Most interesting.  I\'ve come to the conclusion that the Hiver tour 
of Diaspora and Masilla (sp) was a huge intelligence gathering 
expedition.  Though that much is pretty obvious to anyone reading the 
articles.  I think that the Hiver\'s realized that one way or another the 
Imperium was going to be destroyed and would one day have to be rebuilt. 
 By touring the area before the collapse they could find promising locals 
for future recovery and create an accurate list of where the most 
promising technological resources could be found for future reference.  

	It seems unlikely that the Hiver\'s could have visited Cymbline 
first hand, as it was held by the Solomani at the time however it is 
quite likely that having taken one or two transponders apart the could 
have figured out a way to do it with out destroying the Deyo chips.  Once 
they had the chips it is entierly possible, everyone knew Lucan was mad 
about superweapons, have realized the potential that these lifeforms 
possessed.  By figuring this out the Hivers, wizards on computers that 
they are, could have begun developing their own counter-measures before 
the Virus was released.  Evidently the HIver\'s own inate computer 
abilities were not enough to make up for the twenty years of lead time 
the humans had developing this system as the Hiver\'s themselves were 
desimated when Virus rolled through.

	Having re-read the Virus section I can see that there was a fair 
amount of thought involved in this idea, though many of the ideas are 
unclear, the thought that was involved in the ideas is evident.

I hope that we\'ll eventually be able to get star maps that are
accurate, and planet physical stuff. Pop numbers change over time,
but accurate starmaps would be cool.

This doesn\'t take into account other sources of government income, right?
Like starport taxes, coporate taxes, interest earned from money that 
that the Imperium has loaned out, etc. I doubt that most imperial citizens
would be expected to cough up this much money each year. (Heck, even Canada
wouldn\'t tax its citizens that much! :)

Possibly. I haven\'t the time to check them now though, sorry.

Anyways, the Imperium probably has lots of sources of income,
direct income tax probably being the least among them. ANy ideas what
they would be, anyone?

Actually having re-read Survival Margin, I can see another reason for her 
going back there, actually 100 trillion reasons to be precise.  With the 
Solomani pounding at her door through the collapsed front of the Old 
Expanses, remember the OE\'s surrendered to the Sol\'s having given all 
their fleets to Lucan, Margret needed another way to keep the trade lines 
open with the Hivers.  By expanding behind the rift Margret was able to 
do an end round run past the Solomani and straight down into Hiver space. 

What does this mean for the New Era?

It means that the area behind the Rift would have been a major staging 
area for all kinds of high-tech mercantile trade, now none of the worlds 
in that area are particularly survivable.  Lots of jump 1 routes and poor 
atmospheres.  Given that this area was somewhat off the beaten track, 
hell lets face it, the Glimerdrift Reaches embody the word Frontier, it 
is unlikely that this area would have seen the scale of devestation that 
the rest of the Imperium suffered.  Thus, there is probably a ton of 
relic materials just waiting to be recovered.
 
> Then there was virus and I think Virus was really...

> PS - I think Derek has a crush on Margret!!

Actually when you read Rebellion, this is before things get really weird, 
Margret is probably one of the most likable candidates for Player 
Characters to follow.  Sure Craig, Brzk, and The Brothers Varien also fit 
into this catagory, but at the time I was playing a character who was a 
member of the Verminie so my loyalties are kind of swayed in that 
direction.  Plus when you play an RC campaign her strong hold is the one 
thats closest to the Coalition.

I did something similar a number of years ago, except I used SAS and a
spare IBM mainframe.  What\'s very interesting is that I got different
numbers than you did ...

I had 35 sectors, from the GEnie database.  The data was from Early- or
Pre-rebellion sources, and so was closest to the Imperium at its height.

I get a total of 14,754 worlds (not all of these are Imperial).

Sure!

It looks like you\'re using the same raw data I was; the allegiances are
coded for the Rebellion.  In particular, "Dd" is the Domain of Deneb, "Ma"
is Margaret\'s Faction, "Li" is Lucan\'s Imperium - all of which should
properly be part of the "Classic" Third Imperium.  Here\'s my breakdown:

Code:
As = Aslan; Cs = Client State; Dd = Domain of Deneb; Fi = Federation of
Ilelish; Hv = Hiver; Im = Imperial (unaligned or faction unknown);
Li = Lucan\'s Imperium; Ma = Margaret\'s Faction; Na = Non-Aligned (non
Imperial); Ot = Other (includes all Vargr Polities); Rv = Restored Vilani
Empire; So = Solomani; St = Strephon\'s Imperium; Zh = Zhodani

I then combinedthese codes to attempt to produce a reasonable pre-rebellion
Imperium.  Here\'s what I came up with:

Within some areas of the Imperium, alignment codes where used to indicate
ethinc regions and internal semi-autonomous districts.  This also reduced
the count of "Imperial" worlds.

Here\'s my figures:

"POPEX" is the SAS variable name I chose for "Population Exponent" (in other
words, UPP population code).  The blank are 33 worlds for which UPP data was
missing or invalid.  Oddly enough, I have significantly fewer POP-A worlds
than you do, and also fewer population 0 worlds.

When I originally fetched data for my analysis, there were two sets of
files.  One was an extensive and fairly complete set of "early rebellion"
files (which is what I based my analysis on, because I was interested in the
pre-rebellion Imperium).  The other was a much later (and much less
complete) set of later rebellion files (perhaps adjusted - or partly
adjusted - for Hard Times).  Did you use this latter set of data?
If so, I doubt that it reflects the Third Imperium.

I also did some breakdowns by sector and polity of the total population,
total Gross Planetary Product, and estimated tax revenues.  Here\'s the data:

This is overall (all polities).  Population is in thousands (so that\'s a
total of 22,223,926,420,000 sophonts).  GPP is in _local_ credits (not
converted to the TL-15, Starport-A "Imperial" credit).  The TaxMCr _is_
in "Imperial" standard credits; that\'s the amount of tax paid to the 
interstellar government.

Here\'s the breakdown by Polity.  "I" is the Imperium.

The "Army-LMCr" and "Navy-LMCr" are the funds available (in local credits)
for locally-raised army and system-defense units.  These units would
ordinarily be under the control of the worlds that raised them, and are IN
ADDITION to the Imperial (or other empire) military.  The Tax-MCr column
gives the funds available to the Imperium for it\'s own Navy, Marine, Scout,
and Imperial Army forces.  These are in Imperial (TL-15, starport-A)
credits.

It looks like these are easily supported under the Imperial budgets, and
local defense and anti-piracy forces can easily be supported in addition.

By my figures, it\'s about 14% of the Imperial tax revenues; about 18.45
Credits a person a year.

I think your source data is suspect, and the allegiance coding is making
your Imperium be far too small.  

Here\'s one more thing that should prove useful for defense analists.  It\'s a
breakdown of the Imperium by TL and starport type, showing number of worlds
of that type, total population and GPP (local credits) as well as local
defense and Imperial taxes (Imperial taxes are in Imperial credits).

Not in particular; I was thinking about a Web-based version, but I hadn\'t
gotten much farther than just thinking.  My major effort at this point is to
build some extended tables so that people will have more fun things to
design.

The one thing I\'d like to recommend is to be able to load additional,
expanded tables of data.  While the Huge Table of Hulls might be a little
much to add, it would be very nice to be able to add additional items to all
of the existing tables.

That way, when someone designs a nifty new laser turret, or some other gear,
then, if they post the data in the right format, it could be added into the
program.

Pure guesstimate on my part is TL 10 for the basics of reattaching and
regenerating spinal and peripheral nerve damage, and TL 12 for effective
nontrivial brain damage repair.  Prosthetic-assisted versions of each 
appear about a TL earlier.  I can\'t cite canon on this -- it\'s just how I 
feel.

The densest surface mineral you\'re likely to find on a vaguely 
terrestrial planet in *large* deposits is iron ore.  The densest material 
you\'ll find in reasonably pure metallic form is gold, but the deposits of 
that will be much smaller, in general.  The densest stable element is 
osmium, but it\'s rare, and will tend to be found in compounds (ores) 
which reduce its net density.

Given the apparent cultural continuity of English-derived Solomani 
languages, I\'d expect the Sylean core language of Year 0 would relate to 
pre-Long Night variants approximately as well as modern English does to 
Chaucer.  For purely technical or formal writing, it would be closer to 
Shakespeare, as this tends to rely much less on slang, idiom, and other 
quickly-changing language elements.

Helium II, as I recall, is simply supercooled helium.  A hair above 
absolute zero, helium becomes a "superfluid" with all kinds of weird 
properties -- no viscosity, quantized convection cells, and a tendency to 
climb the walls of whatever container it\'s in.  It poses no special 
threat other than being extremely cold (and it requires massive effort to 
keep it that cold -- even the coldest planet won\'t have He II, as even 
the 3K microwave bacground is too warm for it).  I suppose you could 
cobble together some trick whereby the superfluid properties would be 
dangerous, but that\'d be quite a reach.

> Hah!  Now that should get you all wondering! :-)

Oldest trick in the book, that.  Two days before a gaming session, start 
asking your players odd, disconnected questions..."Hey, what\'s the speed 
of a shock wave in granite?" "How many wasp stings do you think it would 
take to kill a human?"...drives \'em nuts. :)

MT\'s Referee\'s Companion, p. 32, claims "Tech Level 11: True nerve 
refusion techniques appear, allowing major neural damage (such as
a severed spinal cord) to be surgically repaired."

*Large* natural deposits?  Probably lead (11.4 g/cm3).  :-)  Iridium is 
denser yet (22.5 g/cm3), but tends to be rare and mixed in with platinum
ore, IIRC.  Uranium and its near relatives are heavy (U is 18.9 g/cm3),
but oxidize readily and thus would be much less dense in ore form.  You
could go for the ultra-rare bugaboo of later Traveller, the room-temperature
superconductor Omnesium (atomic number 119, undiscovered).

> 3. How intelligible would writing from before the Long Night be to the

As others have mentioned, literacy tends to stabilize language.  Vocabulary,
idiom, and understood cultural background would be the sticking points.  Try
reading some 18th century essays to get a feel for what a different style
of writing (another possibility) might be like.

> 4. What is Helium 2, exactly, and does it pose any sort of threat when

I don\'t think such a beastie exists... Helium-3 (2 protons, 1 neutron) and
Helium-4 (2 and 2) show up regularly.  Where have you seen mention of 
this stuff?

I would expect #2.  Every word I\'ve read about Margaret had her being 
more worried about making the trains run on time than restoring her 
empire.

Just make sure that it can readily accept errata-- I mean, extra stuff  8-)

Take a look at the GURPS character generator for some good ideas.  This little
program can save you *tons* of time by doing all of your calculations for you.

There are some things to dislike about Margaret as well...

She is portrayed in a number of canonical sources as being somebody 
who is more worried about the economic condition of her realm than 
the welfare of her citizens.  There are veiled references to a slave 
trade going on within Margaret\'s domain, apparently with Margaret\'s 
knowledge, if not necessarily with her blessing.  In Arrival 
Vengeance, which is really about as close a look at the personality 
of several of the factions as we will find, she is portrayed as 
rather cold, distant, and slightly arrogant.  

She is not portrayed as using people as cannon fodder, such as Lucan
would, but she doesn\'t seem particularly caring for her people either.

On the other hand, Arrival Vengeance portrays the 2 heroic factions 
as being Craig and Norris.  Arrival Vengeance is basically written as 
a bridge between Hard Times, and the as yet to come Virus Era...
It has a very strong pro-Domain of Deneb slant...

The best sources for information on the various factions are
For the early period (Rebellion)
Rebellion Sourcebook
For the later period (Hard Times)
Hard Times Sourcebook
Arrival Vengeance

all three have pretty good general depictions of the state of each 
faction for the era involved.

BTW, Derek, I like your ideas about Margaret\'s expansion into 
Glimmerdrift, and the subsequent effects on Milieu 1200...

Actually, a Citizen of the Imperium would IMO, be best defined as a 
citizen of 1 of the worlds which is a member of the Imperium.  They 
would therefore be eligible for those legal protections entitled to 
them as a citizen of the Imperium.  Unfortunately for that person, 
the vast majority of those protections only extend from 1000 AU out 
of the star system...

Remember that there are some instances in which the Imperium WILL 
take interest in the internal affairs of its member worlds.  For 
example, if a member world...

a) Uses nukes to suppress a rebellion, or to fight another government 
on a balkanized world...  (Imperial Rules of War)

b) A dominant race in a world engages in genocidal practices towards 
another race recognized as sentient by the Imperium... (High Justice 
Crimes)

c) If a world is not prepared to deal with interstellar contact, for 
whatever reason, the Imperium will interdict it... 

d) If a world or portions of the population of the world act in such 
a way as to undermine the security or sovereignty of the Imperium 
within a member world, the Imperium will intervene (Efate in 5FW for 
example)...

There are other examples, but the Imperium is not the Federation of 
Planets.  There is no Prime Directive.  The Imperium will intervene 
in the affairs of a member world if certain circumstances dictate 
it...although such intervention is extremely rare.  Dulinor (and later, 
Norris, incidentally) both just wanted it to be a lot less rare...

Er, actually, it should probably be an additional crew hit per day until the 
ship is decontaminated, since the radiation will be lingering...

On the other hand I can definitely see some of the Milieu 0 pocket 
empires having this problem.

No, *we* obviously don\'t know the answers to these questions. 
Put in "rules" for fission disasters in Traveller, and you 
reduce the game to non-science space-opera, and cause the 
real gearheads to sneer at the author\'s ignorance a lot.   
(If you knew how many howls of laughter nuclear engineers 
get out of the movie "China Syndrome"...) 
 
Fusion reactors are assumed to operate normally, without 
special rules for disasters.  So should fission reactors; 
a properly designed fission reactor is far safer than 
any other known power generation technology.   
(There is at least one member of the gdw-beta list with 
nuclear reactor experience in the Real World(tm); ask 
him, if you\'re worried about it).

I got the Impression from Rebellion, I\'ve never seen Hard-Times and I\'ve 
never read Arrival Vengence, that Margaret is well intentioned but really 
has no idea as to how to be a real ruler of people.  She\'s a buisness 
woman, not a polititian and as such she tends to suffer for it.

I had no idea about a slave trade going on in Delphi.  Does the Arrival 
Vengence incident take place after the birth of the twins and her 
subsequent proclamation by Iris or before.  Okay, Strephon refrences 
giving Avery away in 1125, This is also the year that Margret is accused 
of Genocide and Slavery, (Survival Margin).  This is after Iris has 
proclamed her the most eligible recipient of the Iridium Throne etc.  
This is also after she\'s destroyed the Vermine (sp).  This is at the 
point where Margret started to become more and more like many of the 
other factions, self interested in her own claim to the throne rather 
than in her peoples well being.

Craig and Norris are the only one\'s, well lets lump Brzk in here to but 
he\'s dead by this point, who aren\'t after the throne whole heartedly.  
They\'re more interested in the welfare of their people than carving out 
as much territory for themselves as they can.

think that\'s what it was.

Anyway the person was saying that the ship really wasn\'t big enough at 
500 tons to be a real warship.  Some thoughts on that comment.

1) In T4 Milieu 0 the base TL is 11/12.  Really large ships require 
massive crews at this TL due to the fact it\'s not as easy to automate as 
it is at TL15.  Not written well but you get the point.

2) The Sylean Federation is an expansive state.  How long has it existed, 
I\'m not sure, but it seems to me that if you\'re interested in expanding 
your sphere of influence you\'re better off to have 10 500 ton vessels 
marching around than 1 5,000 ton vessel.  This give you the ability to be 
in more than one place at one time.  

3) It takes longer to build a larger ship.  As an expanding state would 
you rather have your dry dock taken up by one 5,000 ton ship or 10 500 
ton ships.  Again, probably the 10 ships you can crank them out faster 
and therefore have a greater density of ship\'s on the frontier.

4) How many other states you\'re likely to encounter are going to be 
building 5,000 ton vessels?  Not many and given that you\'re the cutting 
technology society in the remains of the second Imperium they will likely 
be much less of a threat to you even if they are building them.

5) This is not from a military stand point but rather from a role playing 
stand point, how easy is it to role play a game on a ship with a crew of 
300?  How about a ship with a crew of 30?  It much easier on a smaller 
ship to allow the players the freedom to, "Jam sink the hyperdrive" and 
"do a reverse polarity scan for isotropic residue."  With a crew of 300 
or 3,000, lets face it no player wants to play Jimmy the toilet scrubber 
they all want to be Grand Admiral Ramapage, 1st cousin to the Emperor, 
Scourge of the Skies, Master of Anti-matter and Boyscout 1st class, there 
are people who do that kind of work for you.

Admiral Bwana: "Boot boy, once you\'ve finished polishing my calalry boots 
make sure to take that really interesting alien isotope down to Dr. 
Pilgrim for analysis.  I\'ll just sit up here and wait for his results."

No damnit most player characters want to be in the lab when that jar 
explodes, or whatever.  Saying to Admrial Bwana, "Well, Dr Pilgrim failed 
his roll the Isotope becomes totally unstable and blows up the ship."  Is 
not likely to get the best reception from your PC\'s.  Where as if they 
blow the ship up themselves, they know there was nothing they could have 
done about it.  They failed 5 rolls in a row, it was their fault.

Thoughts?  Input?

I know a bunch of space nuclear power people here and in Los
Alamos----I\'m also a radical environmentaist.  Split atoms, not trees!
:-)

That said, I think that compared to a fusion reactor, fission reators
*will* be more dangerous.  I know that negative thermal coefficient
reactors (pellet beds) won\'t melt down, but that isn\'t the point when
considering radiation worries during combat in a closed environment.

When a missile rips through the hull and whacks my fission reactor, no
it won\'t blow up or melt down.  It will, however, have a chance of
sending (now vaporized by MJs of damage) nasty fuel around.  Do you
think that it\'s more or less dangerous to be in a drive room filled with
Pu vapor, or H gas?  :-)

> special rules for disasters.  So should fission reactors;

Yup.  By far.  For normal operations.  Having rules for what happens
when a PAW rips the reactor core apart is a different story.
  
You\'re right though, I\'d puke if I saw some crap about nukes leaking
radiation in normal use.  It is possible, though if they aren\'t taken
care of.  People errors, nothing wrong with the technology of it.

Actually, I was referring to rulings like the number of spinal mounts that can
be placed on a single ship (specifically, their relation to parallel and janus
mounts which aren\'t mentioned in SSDS), number of turrets/bays per 100t/1,1000t
displacement, etc.

Now that I think of it, our CANDU reactors are pretty safe  8-)  I merely wanted
to put forward the fact that-- according to Real World(tm) logic-- there is
little reason to make the switch from smaller, cheaper fission reactors at TL8
to large, expensive fusion reactors at TL9 *if* your power requirements do not
excede 1,000MW or so (I thought that there was some unwritten rule for fission
power that I was not aware of).

I *am* aware that fusion reactors would only deal with a small amount of matter
during the fusion process at one time.  A failure at this point would release
very little radiation.  Fission reactors, on the other hand, deal with
potentially more dangerous materials and have to have appropriate safety
features built in-- and these can fail.

Under the current SSDS rules, fusion power plants don\'t really become viable
until they produce more than 250MW, *unless* you have access to fusion "plus" at
TL12.  All of the figures for a TL8 250MW fission reactor are less than those of
a TL10 1,000MW fusion reactor (except for power output, obviously).  If your
power requirements are under 250MW, evan a TL11 vessel may want to use a TL8
fission power plant to bring costs down and reduce Engineering requirements.  As
they stand, it is impossible to build a TL9 100t vessel, and extremely hard to
make a profitable vessel under 500t or so (due to the cost of fusion power
plants) without resorting to a TL8 fission power plant.

Mostly everyone that has submitted ship designs have built them using the
superior TL12 technology (fusion "plus", T-Plates, etc.).  According to things I
have heard, however, the Imperium will hold the monopoly on TL12 in Milieu 0.
Even if the Imperium has reached TL12, this doesn\'t mean that all of her
shipyards are TL12 as well.  My concerns are with these backwater shipyards-- as
well as some of the lesser advanced races-- and their ability to create small,
lower-tech vessels.  Since TL8 fission power plants are smaller & cheaper, I was
merely wondering if there were any drawbacks to them.

Joe, (and any other people looking for SSDS in another format)

I sent to Dave a version of SSDS for Word 2.0.  I don\'e know if it will work
right for any of you, but maybe he will have it up by tonight.  If not, send
me a message and I\'ll try to get it out, or better yet, on my web page.

Hope this helps!

Well, being a neighbourly soul ;-), I just exported it to WordPerfect 
5.0. (I figured an older format would be more useful to the greatest 
number of people...) I could handle Works, earlier Word versions, 
Write, just plain text or a very, very bad html translation. 
(Internet Assistant just isn\'t all that good a product. Still, it\'s 
free. ;-)

The file\'s available at:

    ftp://ftp.baldakinen.umea.se/baldjkn/finalwp5.zip

until I remember to take it away. Which means it\'ll probably be there 
for a week or two, my memory being what it is. ;-)

It\'s on the wrong side of a 64k connection, so please, everyone, be 
gentle. ;-)

This sounds right to me. But didn\'t someone say something about fighters 
being the way to win a space war?  If that\'s the case, maybe larger ships 
with more fighters /are/ the better way to go.

Right.  That\'s a major problem with the TL 11 and FF&S rules, where you 
end up with rather large crews.  I\'m glad it was decided to put the 
additional rule in there where 100 and 200 ton craft can be run by 1 
and 2 people, respectively.  Even if I had a group of 6 players (which I 
don\'t), I think they\'d dislike (and I know I would dislike) forcing them 
to run a ship with as many (or more) NPC\'s than PC\'s.  

To me, this is an important area where, in the fight of playability vs. 
realism, playability just has to win out.

Okeydokey. Write it is.

I\'ve also put up a .ps file, which looks ok in Ghostscript. YMMV.

An eps file was far too much hassle, as I\'d then - according to word

 True, but did that stop Britian from building the HMS Dreadnought, or for

 No doubt, no doubt in the least!
 Merley, all I was saying was that that was _not_ a warship. Imperial
warships according to \'Ships of the Line\'(Ok, I forget what the CT book
was called<grin>, if you really care I\'ll say) but the smallest genuine
warships(capitol ships)/ships of the line were 25,000dtonne and the
largest was 500,000Dtonne...
 Of course, I\'m not the type who would consider a Gazelle a warship, but I
would consider a Midu Agaasham escort(which is the same class size). There
is a diffrince between a warship and a escort, tho.

 A few. Rember, that this is from a decayed empire, hence there would be
some relic ships lying around.. However, they would be rare.

 Aggreed 100%, that\'s why most \'pc sized\' starships are under the
1000dtonne mark. If you did want to do a large ship, just look at<I hate

have a lump of really hot lead.  Ooooh, real dangerous.  This is even ok by
energy conservation.  Lead releases energy if its split, it just wont split by

This is also a great way to make fission warheads.  Take a lump of lead and a
nuclear damper.  Detonate by making Lead 206 really unstable, decaying by
spontaneous fission.  Pretty simple.

I don\'t know exactly what the canon says about the capabilities of nuclear

Well, I\'ve had no luck.  Someone sent me a uuencoded version of SSDS 
(sorry, I deleted the header info after I exported the email, and don\'t 
remember who it was! drat, drat, drat).  I uudecoded it, downloaded it, 
and loaded it into WP 6.0.  It translated it from WP 5.0 with no 
problems.  Then, when I scrolled down to the second page, it gave me an 
error indicating some area of memory was corrupted, and forced me to shut 
down.  Grrr.

Then I went to the address above and downloaded the file.  I unzipped it, 
loaded it into WP (again, the translation was no problem).  But, once 
again, as soon as I tried to view page 2, it crashed on me....with the 
same error message.

Now, I can load any other file and have no problems (I\'m on a machine 
with 32 MB, so RAM isn\'t a problem ;).  But every version of SSDS makes 
it gag.  Maybe I\'m just not meant to have this file . . . 

Thanks to all who attempted to help.  <sigh>

Ship-reactors do face one disaster that current reactors do not: they 
fly, and can crash.  This may cause some worlds to ban or restrict 
such ships from entering the atmosphere.  Plus, when refueling is 
required, it is more expensive and inconvenient.  I think this 
balances a stable, mature technology being more space efficient than 
fusion at earlier tech levels.

That sort of depends on the size of everybody else\'s warships doesn\'t

So I guess I\'ll join you beind that desk. <g>

Seriously, I think some folks are most interested in building these
monster warships...why?  Maybe they just like to build them?  Maybe
they are involved in fleet/taskforce games where they less play
characters than play ships...sort of SFB like?

Personally, I\'m interested in a ship *entirely* for what it brings to
the roleplaying experience.  I don\'t especially care about armor
values, laser ROFs, or the arguments between the KKE & Det-Laser
missle folks.  I want a ship where characters actually use their
skills to *fly*, *fight* and *fix* the darn thing...and I don\'t care
it that\'s unrealistic or not.  A gunner uses her *gunnery* skill to
target and shoot at an opponent.  A pilot uses her *pilot* skill to
maneuver the ship.  An astrogator uses his *astrogation* skill to find
and lock onto jump coordinates. Techs and engineers use their
*gravtics* skill to fix the broken grav module, *electronics* skill to
fix the sensors, etc.

Frankly, I don\'t care that much about space combat.  That *rarely*
comes up, and when it does I\'ll handle it both more abstractly and
with more detail.  The detail is what the PC\'s *do*, and the results
of the combat.  The abstract is the how of the combat.

I haven\'t seen *that* emphasised anywhere!

Ok Derek, still want me behind the desk with you. <g>

        Rich Text Format (RTF) is generally considered a portable format ...

I don\'t like the fighter model.  It\'s too Star Wars...too Battle Star
Glactica! <g>  

Why don\'t we make all the minor craft boats?  After all, we already
have the Ship\'s Boat and the System Defence Boat!  The "carriers"
become Boat Tenders.  The "fighters" become Missile Boats, Patrol
Torpedo Boats, Gun Boats.  Make the Boats bigger than fighters, but
smaller than SDB\'s with crews of 2 or 3: pilot, sensor ops,
gunner/missile ops.

It\'s a different model from ST or SW, and one just right for
Traveller.

I still think nobody in their right mind will try to run a ship by
themselves..for long anyway.  <g> Generally though, I do like smaller
crews than the "rules" are giving us.  A group of 3 to 8 is the best
size for RPGing, and that\'s what this is all about. Right?

Nope. There are actually some base-10 computers! There are also a lot
of *analog* computers (they are making a comeback, but slowly). 

Multi-value logic (ie more than just 2 possible values) is at least a
hundred years old. And it has been applied to some computer systems.

Currently, most logic in PCs uses 0v = 0, +5v = 1. They are dropping it
down to 3v on newer chips. But it *isn\'t* "on/off". These are just
arbitrarily defined "logic levels". RS-232 uses 0 = -25 to -5 v, and 1
= +5 to +25v.

So, for example, you could have -5v = -1, 0v = 0 and +5v = 1. In
fact there *are* setups where diferent voltage levels are used for
different values. They aren\'t used much because binary logic is
sufficient for most things.

But the logic systems in older telephone exchanges used things like
stepper relays to get 10 and 12 level logic.

Sorry, wrong answer. A given sequence of bits means different thingsin
different architectures. The sequence that is an "add" instruction on
one system might be a jump instruction on another.

Sorry, won\'t work. The whole point about different architectures being
a problem is that a program that will run on one architecture is utter
nonsense on another. 

As a *poor* example, consider the fact that English, Spanish, German,
etc can all be written using the same alphabet. That *doesn\'t* mean
that a document written in one language is readable by a speaker of the
others.

The virus is a *program*. As such, it consists of machine language
instructions. Different architectures use different values to encode
those instructions. So a program for one, can\'t run on another. It has
to be translated somehow (and it isn\'t always possible to translate
them!) 

So if you load the virus onto a computer that uses a different
instruction set, *at best* it would crash messily. Morelikely the CPU
would take one look at the code sequences and generate a "not an
executable program" error.

To use an analogu closer to the way real viruses work:

A virus is string of DNA or RNA. The particular values coded into the
DNA are instructions on how to create protiens, enzymes, and DNA. *But*
they only work if they get into a cell that uses the same codings! If a
cell uses different codings in it\'s DNA, the virus instructions would
result in the creation of some random chunk of chemicals, not a copy of
the virus. 

Luckiliy for real world viruses, there are almost *no* variations in
the coding scheme used by all known life forms. This is one of the
pieces of evidence that suggests that all organisms on earth are
related.

But to *do* that, it has to be able to run on that system. So it can\'t
use that method to figure out how the system works!

Nope. There is still the *very* important distinction between "code"
and "data". There are a number of computer architectures where the
executable programs, and the data they work on don\'t even use the same
RAM, much less the same storage. 

As a *crude* example of this, I can send you a uuencoded program. But
the *only* way it\'ll ever get executed on your system is if you
uudecode it, and then *tell* your computer to run the resulting
program.

That\'s the killer. There is *no* computer virus in existence (and never
will be) that can infect a machine without the machine first
*executing* an infected file. *Reading* the file is perfectly safe.
I\'ve got a disk with samples of several viruses that had infected
systems where I used to work. I can copy the disk safely. I can use a
editor to examine the files. Still no infection risk. It\'s only if I
*run* one of them that there\'s any chance of getting infected.

The one way that "the Virus" *could* propogate would be as follows:

Supposedly the IFF transponders all use the "living" chips, and exchange
data among themselves. Ok, that let\'s the virus jump from one
transponder to another.

To jump to any other system, it *can\'t* infect via the datalinks, as
they carry *data* not executable code. So, what it has to do is
"cannibalize" part of the transponder circuitry to create a mobile
subunit capable of *physically* following the data links.

It can do that because the circuitry in the transponder (part of it,
anyway) is alive, so it can "feed" on adjacent chips.

Once the subunit (call it a "motile") is created, it\'ll follow the
link. It\'ll probably patch into the link so that the data goes like
this:

	link <->motile<->link<->transponder

That lets it communicate back to the infected transponder, and keeps it
from needing much intelligence. Once it gets to the end, it\'ll leave a
small "relay" section patched in between the end of the link and the
link. That section will route data to the end of the link as if nothing
had happened, and route anything to or from the motile back to the
infected transponder.

The motile will have only a limited amount of raw materials an energy
to try to determine what sort of system is at the end of the link, and
how to take it over. It\'d have to use logic probes to follow signals,
and then as it isolated sections of circuitry, splice in to replace
them. 

To translate this into PC terms, we\'ll have the transponder be the
modem. So the motile crawls through the cable to the serial port. Once
it gets there, the "relay" is exchanging the usual stuff with the
serial port, while only *part* of the cable is dedicated to that, and
the rest is handling the data between the motile and the modem (again,
the relay is making sure the data goes to the right place, so nothing
unusual seems to be happening).

The motile would use visual scanning and logic probes to follow the
signals from the port onto the serial card. If it encountered a chip it
recognized, it could patch itself in around it and emulate it until it
had a chance to "eat" the chip, and replace it with a dedicated emultor
that was much smaller and more efficient. 

If it didn\'t recognize it, it could strip off the packaging and
directly examine the chip. That would take longer, but it\'d determine
*exactly* what the chip did. Then it could again replace it.

After replacing all the chips in an area, the virus would analyze the
functions, and be able to consolidate them (and probably simplify them,
as the average "stock" chip has a lot of possible actions that don\'t
ever get used in some circuits). That\'d give more silicon to devote to
building a processor capable of running the virus on this end of the link.

More and more functions could be duplicated locally, meaning less and
less of the serial cable would be used for *controlling* and more for
comunication. Eventually, it\'d be just a comm link again, linking two
copies of the virus.

If there\'s enough silicon on the card, the virus would have a copy of
itself there, with a small sub-processor emulating the
modem/serialcard. 

If not, the motile would move onto the motherboard (probably *several*
motiles). Trace the lines to the CPU, and other cards and start taking
over. 

The peripheral cards would get converted, the CPU/BIOS would get
examined to determine if the virus could be made to run on the
processor. If it could, great, it\'d load itself, and eat the BIOS,
meanwhile emulating the old setup until it finshed taking over that
system. If the processor couldn\'t run the virus (too weak, or too
weird) the virus would try to convert it. 

It\'s possible that there would be processors the virus couldn\'t figure
out. Those it might just try to crash before "eating" them. 

Once it had the system converted, it\'d be time to trace more
inter-system links.

Note that this is a *lot* different than yur model, and it is slower,
because the virus has to *physically move* a "tool" to the system it is
going to infect so that it can examine the system.

By *any* standards. This is not something subject to argument or
improvement like scientific theories. This is a matter of *definition*.
2+2=4 regardless of how far in the future you are. Likewise, a computer
virus is a program, and as such, the code making it up *must* be
executed to take effect.

Even granting your point (which I don\'t) there\'s a *huge* hole in your
logic. Sure the virus may be sentient, and thus able to change the way
the system it is running on works (about as likely as your mind being
able to change the way your brain works). But the system that the virus
is trying to infect *isn\'t* sentient! Regardless of what it may be able
to do once the virus is running on it, it can only behave according to
its programming until the virus is running on it.

So any explanation of how the virus infects a system has to explain how
the system can be changedto allow the virus *before* the virus is
loaded. (You can run C64 programs on a PC if you load an emulator, but
the c-64 program can\'t load the emulator on the PC, the PC has to do
that in accordance with it\'s current programming)

You fail to understand the *critical* difference between data inputs
and programming inputs. Unless a computer is SPECIFICALLY TOLD "this is
to be loaded and executed" it won\'t execute data being fed to it via an
input. It may display it, analyze it, or ignore it, depending on what
the current program tells it to do, but it won\'t *run* it. 

For sensor data to be a way to infect the system, the computer would
already have to have been told to treat the incoming data as a program.
And there is *no* reason for anyone to set the computer up that way, in
fact there are a tremendous number of reasons *not* to.  Mostly to
prevent loading a virus that could take over the sensor system! Unless
you want to claim that four thousand years of experience with computers
has somehow made the folks designing and programming them *less* able
to see the vulnerabilities than we can, it just doesn\'t fly. 

In case you were unaware, computer viruses were postulated in the early
60s. And some of the other ways that security can be breached that were
described in the early 70s are far beyond anything anyone has tried.
Yet military, government, and even large business computer requirements
are designed to protect against these.

Hate to tell you this, but gravitics is *not* that far outside current
theory. And we\'ve pointed out things that ould be a problem with
gravitics, though mostly it isn\'t a problems.

Psionics is not explainable. More or less by definition. :-)

> Perhaps Virus is minutely psionic?

They don\'t say it is. If they did, we wouldn\'t be making the objections
we do.

One *doesn\'t* have to know a great deal about computers. One merely has
to know the basic principles behind them.

FTL is pretty much a given in SF, and is necessary to make interstellar
travel practical for a game. Besides, there are *several* different
ways it could be accomplished in theory.

Antigravity is the same. Its a staple of SF, and theory doesn\'t *forbid
it, in fact there are some ways to do it that we *know* would work, we
just can\'t *do* it (engineering problem :-)

Also, the effects of both of the above are easily figured. Ditto for
reactionless drives, though as has been pointed out, the drives in
Traveller *don\'t* bother to try to work right, and thus we run into
problems in the game *because* they didn\'t work things through.

Psionics is a common SF theme, and at least the Traveller rules try to
be both limited and consistent.

Now we get to the computers and Virus bit. Computers are based on
*logic*. And most of the rules they are based on have been studied for
several thousand years! We\'ve refined things a bit, and explored the
ins and outs, but the actual rules of logic are about as fixed as the
rules of geometry. 

Sure, they may have hardware we can\'t conceive of in the 57th century.
But the rules the *programs* have to follow won\'t be any different.
Logic is logic. How you *implement* a device to perform logical
operations doesn\'t affect the results of those operations (except that
if you don\'t do it right, the answers will be wrong).

Heck, the principles of computer programming are well over 100 years
old.  Look up "Babbage". He designed a *mechanical* computer. If it
hadn\'t been beyond the machining technology of the day (but only *just*
beyond), he\'d have had something at least as good as Enaic. And guess
what? The principles governing its operation aren\'t all that different
from those governing current systems.

You see, ever since Galileo, things have been running in a manner that
most people still don\'t understand. We don\'t know everything, but we
*do* know that we know things for certain inside certain limits. If we
discover anything unexpected, it will have to be something such that
under "normal" conditions it has no effects. So while we can\'t know
what may be discovered, we *can* know that what we currently know still
applies in the areas we\'ve tested things. (just like Newtonian physics
works just fine until you get close to light speed).

Better tell that to all the folks publishing papers on it. FTL is *not*
impossible. It just has to meet certain conditions. Check out the
various papers on wormholes, the papers on "closed timelike curves" (ie
time travel, which is interchangeable with FTL), and things like
Alucubierre\'s warp drive. 

We don\'t know *how* to create the effects (in most cases), but theory
does show that the effects don\'t break anything (expect perhaps casuality).

Why? It\'s rather easy to work out the energy requirements, and they are

True, but only to the extent that their properties are going to be a
lot different than the way they are described.

The thing here is this. FTL doesn\'t actually break *anything*. There
are some physicists who don\'t like the consequences of it being
possible, there are others who don\'t really see a problem.

Antigravity/contragravity, it still doesn\'t break theory, it\'s just
that we can\'t figure out ways to do it without some exotic materials.
:-) 

Reactionless drives, ok, we bend *one* law a bit. :-)

The virus requires a *number* of things which are all very unlikely.
Things like extreme stupidity in program, OS, and system design. 

See my message where I describe how something like the virus *could*
work, and not the rather important differences between how it is
described as working. (no more cases of data being treated as code, no
more being able to load and run an executable for one architecture on a
different one without knowing in advance *which* architecture you are
loading on, etc).

No need. No conflict. (Seriously!)

Make that unify the electroweak force and gravity. And as I noted,
using both Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, there are several
ways of manipluating gravity.

Wanna bet? I can show you designs for gravity catapults, anti-grav
units, and several other such things. The principles are *well*
understood. We just can\'t *build* them. 

Ditto for a lot of proposed nanotech. The theory is well understood.
Designs can be drawn up. It\'s just that we don\'t have the *engineering*
capability.

Computers were designed in the 1800s. They just didn\'t have the ability
to machine the parts required (these were mechanical systems).

Huh? The Psionic suppressions are in the same league as various

Physicists again. And while jump doesn\'t sound likely, FTL is *not* a

Sorry. Wrong answer. The reactionless drive can be *ignored* (make it a
reaction drive of some sort) with next to no effect on the game. The
Psionic suppression has little effect on the game, though it has some
effect on the background. You can drop psionics from the game and most
players wouldn\'t notice. FTL is *not* that big a deal. As for the trade
rules, notice the number of cariants floating around? They are *not*
critical to the background. There are lots of variant combat rules
around too. Again, no real effect on the background.

Now, consider the virus. Not only is it much farther "out of line" than
any of the item you mention (each of them is basicaly "a" problem, the
virus is *at least* 4) but it is *integral* to the background.

Right.

Right.

You\'ve lumped several things together that are *not* the same. 

It *is* ludicrous to have the Virus use sensors as a means of
infecting. But it is *possible* (though unlikely) that comm links could
transmit it. It depends on the nature of the link, and other factors
(you have a *chance* of infecting my computer through my modem, but not
thru my FM radio or my cable TV box!). 

The transponders are a weird case. In the real world a transponder is a
sensor (radar pulse detector) coupled to a specialized transmitter.
When it gets the right sort of radar pulse ("gets interrogated") it
responds by echoing back the pulse (greatly increasing the image on the
radar screen) and tacking on an IFF code to identify itself. A *very*
dumb piece of equipment. (they aren\'t even hooked up to anything else
on board except the radar antenna)

In TNE, they say that the transponders use the Cymbelline chips, and
"chatter" back and forth. So I\'d have to give you the ability for them
to be infected.

If it isn\'t activated, then it isn\'t alive! It has to be alive to do
anything. It\'s in "suspended animation" until it is activated by the
receiving computer. Its "life processes" consist of instructions being
executed by the computer. So it isn\'t alive unless it is being
executed. If it isn\'t being executed, then it\'s like a person in a low
berth, all biological processes are stopped.

I think you folks need to re-think this point.

Again I disagree. For the simple fact that while we may not understand
how the *hardware* works, it is still going to be performing a series
of simple logical operations. The software is just going to be a set of
logical instructions. Don\'t confuse the hardware operations with the
*logical* operations.  And don\'t confuse the high level language
statements with the logical operations they get translated into for the
hardware.

The rules for the simple logical operations were set down by Charles
Babbage and Ada Lovelace more than 100 years ago. And the rules of
logic they are based on go back more than 2000 years.

Babbage wouldn\'t understand current computer languages. But they *all(
get translated into machine code, which is machine specific encodings
for the basic logical operations of *all* computers (add, subtract,
and, or, move data, compare data, branch, etc). And he\'d understand
those operations with no trouble, because he invented most of them.
Some machines have codes that combine a number of the operations into

Which I grant you (see above)

To work on any other system, the virus either needs that system to have
a built-in "back door" or it needs a *physical* manifestation that can
examine the target system and makes changes.

Lisp is even worse, I\'m told. 

However, be aware that most systems you see are von Neuman machines.
Not all computers are. And the interchangeability of code and data is
one of the characteristics of von Neumann systems. 

Systems have been built where the code and data are *totally* seperate.
They don\'t share the same address space. Self-modifyng code is
*impossible*. 

These are mostly research systems for investigating aspects of computer
theory. But given some trends in the rate at which viruses spread, and
the vulnerability of networked systems to breakins, they could become a
major factor in future systems.

This is a good example of the difference between mean, mode, and
median. The "average" is the mean. The mode is the most common value,
in your above case I suspect that it is either in the below 2 range, or
the over 60 range. And the median is the value you get if you sort the
data into order, and then look at the middle of the list. 

In a "normal distribution" all three are the same. In real data, you
can get multiple modes (I\'ve seen data where the curve was smooth, but
had *three* "humps"), and the median can be all over the place.

This is why the standard deviation is useful.

Alas, while this view is widespread, it simply is not true. Galileo
invalidated Aristotle. No physics since then have been invalidated.
Instead, they\'ve been shown to be special cases. 

Why? Because with Galileo, we changed the way we determined "truth". We
adopted the scientific method. So the process of learning is:
1. make observations/perform experiments
2. come up with hypothesis that explains #1 and that can be tested
3. test hypothesis, if it fails, go back to 2.
4. hypothesis becomes theory after it is confirmed sufficiently.
5. go back to 1 looking for data not covered by theory.

What this means is that the theories are based on how the universe
actually works. When we find something new, it\'s because we are making
observations of things outside the previous range of observables. Thus,
for example, we found that the speed of light didn\'t vary with the
earth\'s movement thru space. That led to special relativity. But it did
*not* invalidate Newton! It just meant that you had to add some
corrections to Newton when you got near the speed of light.

Quantum effects require corrections when dealing with very small
things, again, at normal scale they are not applicable, Newton does fine.

So we won\'t have "completely rewritten" things. We\'ll have discovered
new *exceptions* to the rules, but those exceptions will only apply in
"special" circumstances.

So we could discover contragravity, or even develop a reactionless
drive. But they\'d still be subject to the laws we know except for
whatever special cases make them work. And tend to not involve
violating things like conservation of mass/energy (which actually turns out
to be the same thing as saying "the laws of physics are indepenedent of
where or when you are in the universe")

Technology is not science. Engineers will come up with stuff we
couldn\'t think of. It\'ll still follow the laws of physics, even if they
are a bit revised.

As noted *many* times before, FTL is *not* disallowed by current
theory. In fact, that\'s one of the reasons some physicists get so vocal
about it. They don\'t *like* the fact that theory doesn\'t say "you can\'t
do that".

Please consider that science is more than a little different than other
means of learning. And that trying to ignore it just because it is
inconvenient tends to come back and bite you. :-)

I don\'t object to Psionics, even though they are hardly scientific. And
while I point out that "reactionless" drives really would have to have
limits we don\'t see, I don\'t really expect folks to play them that way
(though it would be nice :-)

But in *any* sort of sf, "hard" or "soft", there is an unwritten rule
that needs to be kept in mind. It\'s ok to violate scientific law AS
LONG AS YOU KNOW YOU ARE. It\'s also recommended that you try to
minimize the violations.

Nobody realized that thruster plates violated conservation of energy,
and a bunch of other laws. The result was the planetkiller ship. 

Nobody listened when it was pointed out that the Virus just plain
couldn\'t *do* all the things it was supposed to. So we have something
that does things that a bright 12 year-old will go "Say what?!" about.

I agree that flaming is not good. But it\'s hard to resist when someone
posts something that is about as silly as "water burns", and does so
*loudly*, and as a response to a post that was reasonable.

Folks, nobody expects you to be an expert at everything. But please try
to realize that an *uninformed* opinion about anything technical is
not terribly likely to be right. If someone says something can\'t be
done, *don\'t* get in their face about it. If you are an expert, point
out the error politely. If you aren\'t, and they might be, consider that
you *could* be wrong. And ask them if there\'s a way to do what you want
that *will* work. Or at least doesn\'t do *quite* as much violence to
the laws of nature. :-)

But arguing that we don\'t know anything compare to the future is just
plain silly. They will know *more*, but what we know will be part of
what they know.

You are missing the point. There\'s a difference between a *sensor* and
a comm link. A comm link can be transmitting data or code. Thus the
fancy phone you mention. Ditto for the gunnery turret.

Now, let\'s consider your "computers embedded in everything" idea. Say a
fancy home control system that links the lights, phone, appliances,
security system, heat airconditioning, the works.

I\'d accept someone invading it via the telephone, or even the cable tV
(assuming it has a cable link for both tv/radio *and* net linking). But
I refuse to believe that it can be taken over by varying the light
level at the photocell in the security sytem (the one used to determine
if it\'s dark enough to turn on the security lights) or by varying the
temperature at the thermal sensors for the heating/cooling system!

A sensor is a device that *measures* something, and reports the
measurement. A sensor reports data. Period. It is not and never would
be used as a means of inputting program code. For one thing, encoding
the program so it could be *fed* to most sensors would be a major
hassle. Take that photcell for example, it *may* be capable of
reporting more than just light/dark. But if so, what is the *range* of
brightness it can sense, and what is the *sensitivity* (ie how many
levels does it divide that range into). And what is the response time
(ie how fast can it register changes).

The range determines the range of outputs you have to deal with. The
sensitivity determines how much info you can cram into one output. And
the response time determines how fast you can send.

Re-read the above. 30% of the local miltary budget is the assesment for
the Imperial *military*. Nothing is said about any other taxes.

No. It is a lifeform (intelligence) whose *body* is a computer, and
whose mind is a program.

The problems are due to people not stopping to think that the virus can
no more exist without hardware than we can exist without our bodies.

At some future data it may be possible to "download" your
mind/personality/whatever and upload it into a new body. But the body
(be it organic or computer) is required for the mind to function.
The virus just does this naturally.

Please don\'t drag soul or spirit into it, that just makes things
messier, and I can still point out that pure soul/spirit doesn\'t have
much effect on things. :-)

Which is why I go for the simple "explanation" of "it\'s this big, takes
thus-and-so amount of power, and does this". You can add in some fluff
about it requires some special material to work if you want to get
fancy.

The trick is that you have to make sure that they are consistent with
what is already known about the universe. Because that is *not* going
to change. It\'s going to get added to, and have qualifiers added to
statements, but it\'ll still be true. And it\'ll have the advantage that
nobody in the current time can figure out a way to use it to screw up
the universe. :-)

Plus, you can use *current* knowledge to get a feel for what you can
do. We may not know how to cram a 1 gigawatt power source into a
fountain pen, but we can *certainly* figure out lots of things to do
with it. And if we know the power requirements. size and mass of the
other frammistats in the game, we can figure out how to use it with
them.

She was black in the comic book. They were stuck with her. :-)

Also, the comic was set here on earth, at least the issues I saw. So
were the early tv episodes.

Frankly, it would be very surprising if the survivors of Civil War, 
Hard Times, and Virus, wanted to be associated with the Imperium in 
any way...certainly not in form of government.

The single biggest handicap for the Regency is going to be convincing 
people in the coreward regions of the Imperium that they have truly 
changed...that they aren\'t just the Imperium in new clothes...  If 
unburdened of this handicap, they\'d probably steamroll the RC...

In the 57th Century, they still have kids and they still have cultures.
Kids still need to be acculturated.  Schools can acculturate kids relatively
cheaply.  So kids will still go to school.  They\'ll still spend all day
there (if only so that their parents can have some freedom from them), so
they\'ll still need to eat.  Therefore they\'ll still have school lunches.

What bothered me is the concept of a sector-wide school lunch program.
That\'s the opposite of the hands-off approach normally taken by interstellar
governmental levels in the Imperium.

SMALL SPOILER AHEAD:

The twins are definitely referenced in the game, so yes they are 
alive.  The scenario historically takes place around 1125, and the 
twins are shown as being 5 years old.  1 of them is the daughter of 
Strephon, by artificial insemination, BTW...

The general impression left by Arrival Vengeance is that she is an 
effective administrator, but not much of a people person.  Strephon 
(who is the real Strephon, in case it was not apparent from Survival 
Margin) is cast as a tragic figure, while Duke Craig, & Norris, are 
revered in the game...

Actually, if you want my opinion, they were all scum, including 
Dulinor.  Anyone who could willingly sentence billions to die out of 
personal gain (and in the end, that\'s all any of them with the 
exception of Norris & Craig), deserves little respect...

I would say that this period probably started around 1120, when it 
became apparent that there would be no more united 3rd 
Imperium...after that it was basically a Lebanon 
situation...guerrillas killing each other for no real purpose...

Those excessive starport berthing fees and the outrageous price of refined
fuel no doubt contribute to Imperial coffers.  Likewise, the common carrier
Cr1000 per ton must reflect a tax already subtracted for play transparency.
(Let\'s see, there\'s 40 tons of cargo -- roll -- heavy equipment parts,
destined for Forboldn.  The rate is C1064 per ton, but we pay the Cr64 to
the port authority as Imperial tax, so we get Cr1000 per ton....).

    'body' => 'Well, with many thanks to Dave Golden and the fine people of GDW-beta who
have completed the SSDS/QSDS.  I downloaded their work, printed it out,
and started to design a ship for an adventure this Sunday.  The ship
starts out as a 2000Td bulk cargo carrier.  I will post its high points,
and try and do a USP for it.  So a drum roll please....

Bulk Freighter 2000 tons ( I know Peter Miller did this also)

Tons 2000 SL Box		Volume 28,000m^3	MCr 320 (ballpark)
Crew 14			Pass 0/0			Low 0
Cargo 1400		Controls Std/Bridge	TL-14

09 Size Code		02 Jump Rating
00 Fire Control Rating	01 G-Rating/Maneuver Drive
00 Battery - 0,0,0,0	01 Power Plant Rating
00 Battery - 0,0,0,0	404/S/R Fuel Rating
00 Battery - 0,0,0,0	02(70) Sandcasters
			02 Armour	16 Structure

OK, that\'s the ship.  It carries 1400 tons of cargo, has power and tonnage
set aside for an MFD, including a bridge station.  It has four empty
sockets for weapons, and has 15Mw of power for 4 TL-14 Laser turrets.  It
uses the High Automation optional rules to get the crew down, but I did
not have the computer table to reduce the crew even more.  The crew
breakdown is as follows, Command 2 (Captain, 1st Officer), Maneuver 2
(Pilot, Astrogator), Electronics 1, Steward/Maintenance/Medical 1, Gunnery
3, and Engineering 5.  The accommodations are as follows: 1 Large
Stateroom (Captain), 2 Small Staterooms (1st Officer, Pilot, Astrogator,
Chief Engineer), and 12 Bunks.  It has fuel scoops, and can purify fuel in
48 hours.  One gunner can be eliminated if no weaponry is used.  It also
has docking rings for two 90 ton craft (but no craft are carried, they are
just for cargo operations).

The purpose of this design is to simulate a small bulk carrier for a large
freight line.  I did this to see if it was economically feasible to
operate using the current rules, and make money.  I did operational
calculations for both a mortgage and an outright purchase (more likely for
a large company). 

Operating Expenses (est)
ID			Month (CR)		Year (MCr)
Salaries			18,000			.216
Life Support		56,000			.7
Annual Maintenance	26,667			.320
Berthing			2,000			.025
Mortgage		1,333,333		16
Total			1,436,000		17.261

Revenues
100% Capacity		2,800,000		35
90%			2,520,000		31.5
80%			2,240,000		28
70%			1,960,000		24.5
60%			1,680,000		21
50%			1,400,000		17.5
40%			1,120,000		14
30%			840,000			10.5
20%			560,000			7
10%			280,000			3.5
0%			0			0

As can be seen, a 50% cargo capacity will barely pay for the ship at
1000Cr per ton.  Following is a profit margin breakdown

Profit/(Loss)		Month (2 trips)		Year
100% Capacity		1,364,000		17,739
90%			1,084,000		14.239
80%			804,000			10.739
70%			524,000			7.239
60%			244,000			3.739
50%			(36,000)			.239  (Month is 2 trips but year is 25 trips or 12.5
months)
40%			(316,000)			(3.3261)
30%			(596,000)			(6.761)
20%			(876,000)			(10.261)
10%			(1,156,000)		(13.761)
0%			(1,436,000)		(17.261)

That was for a mortgage.  A large shipping firm would most likely purchase
it outright, thus saving the 120% interest..  Following are the Return on
Investment (ROI) times for the ship.  Formula is Total Cost of
Ship/(Profit -Operating Expenses)  Operating Expenses for this ship are
1.261MCr per year.

ROI			Number of Years
100% Capacity		9.48
90%			10.58
80%			11.97
70%			13.77
60%			16.21
50%			19.71
40%			25.12
30%			34.64
20%			55.76
10%			142.92
0%			Never!

BTW: The first cut at this design using the SSDS 1.2 revision had the cost
in the 600MCr range which made it VERY difficult to pay for.  Now what can
we fit into 1400 tons.  I am thinking of designing an even large ship, say
10,000-50,000 for bulk freight, and see if any economies of scale come in.
 I do think there might be problems with this size ship of loading the
cargo in 1 week.  You would have to pay dockhands, or have other equipment
to load/offload.  Really big ships can only orbit, so that might be a
problem also.

destroyer instead of 10,000, and maybe 500 for an escort instead of 5,000.
 However, even these rules of thumb don\'t work too well.  You see the
purpose of the Navy is to overpower any opponent.  How will a 500 ton
escort look when it goes up against 3 400 ton corsairs?  The Navy won\'t
risk ships like that.  They will send in a KTon+ ship at least that can
smite the Corsairs in the blink of an eye.

Another point I will continue to hammer.  With the Military Tech at Tl-12.
 I think that carriers will become one of the mainstays of the fleet.  You
see The Imperium will be the only group out there that can field 20-50 ton
fighters.  A carrier with 100 of those would be a formidable opponent,
especially against smaller opponents.  The fighters could quickly pacify a
system, and a group of 4 could most likely handle any opponent they meet. 
You might need more for larger ships, but that is what fighter groups are
for.  From a role-playing standpoint, fighters make great environments for
either side.  You can let each character operate independently, or let
them feel the wrath of a swarm of Ramparts.

Exactly, I am getting sick of hearing referees who don\'t know how to set
ground rules complain "awww, my player\'s characters are too old and have
too many skills".  Ther referee is ALL POWERFUL.  Any ref who lets his
players just waltz all over him isn\'t much of a ref.

1. VIRUS

Thank you Douglas, Ross, and Paul {tiger}, for some sanity in
this discussion.  I thought this thread had been done to death?

(BTW, I thought that you could *not* get infected via sensors? I didn\'t 
read this in any of the material. I have no problem with Virus attacking 
via the transponders, as these were already alive, and had access to
the main CPU to execute code. My main problem was that it was supposed to 
reproduce by physically cutting code on other chips. How? Where did it 
get the power? It can\'t tell a powerpoint to give more power to the 
computer (actually, come to think of it, aboard ship it probably *can*, 
but how does it get the power diverted to itself? Oh well, more handwaving). 

My *real* gripe was the way that this plot device effectively destroyed
all that DGP had done: no Imperium to do a "Grand Tour" through anymore,
no sentient robots anymore, all that work on races and system generation
gone - if GDW had deliberately wanted to destroy all of DGP\'s work, they
couldn\'t have done a better job. 

...BUT, having said that, I also have to say that the TNE books (from
Survival Margin thru Path of Tears, etc, up the the Regency Sourcebook)
contained some of the best material I had seen from GDW in many a year. As
with ANY material, I will use what I like, and discard what I don\'t like -
after all, *I* am the referee in my game. I have never, ever, run a
scenario straight out of the box, and I\'m not going to start now. You HAVE
to modify everything to fit your group, their situation, and your playing
style. 

2. NETIQUETTE

Just a general point, as I don\'t want to flame anyone in particular, but
can we all perform the following out of politeness: 

- - please DO NOT quote 20 lines and add "I agree". Don\'t even quote 20
lines and add your own 20 lines. Cut the quoted text to *just a few* lines (let\'s
say 2) specific to your point (THEN you can add your 20 lines). 

<rant mode on>

Believe me, the people following your particular thread WILL recognise the
quoted text and its context - really, they will, believe me!! 

I couldn\'t keep up on a 1200-baud modem, and I still can\'t keep up on my
new 28800 baud modem!! The excess quoted text wastes bandwidth and DOUBLES
the size of each digest! Remember some people (no, not me, fortunately)
actually have to pay for EACH BYTE THEY DOWNLOAD!! 

Please be considerate and give us all a break.

<rant mode off>

The above is not intended as a way of saying people\'s POV\'s are
unimportant.  It is just meant as a plea to reduce the "noise" so it is
easier to hear what you all are saying. 

3. MINIATURES

Paul said: 
>Yeah, I hated buying all those outrageously priced migures. They ran my
>credit card bill up so high!!!  :-)

With no credit card, I was only able to buy half of them! ;-)

Is there any word on whether RAFM will produce miniatures for IG (either
starships or people)? They don\'t seem to reply to mail - do they have a
Net page or email address??

No seriously I can see where HUGE warships have their place, but in a 
small state that\'s trying to expand it\'s sphere of influence rapidly 
building anything over about 2000 tons is a massive waste of manpower.

Absolutely.  My charaters are in it for the roleplaying experience, not 
to have the snot beaten out of them everytime they do something wrong.  
Sure there\'s nothing quite like the Han Solo flying past the conning 
tower of the SuperStar Destroyer.  Perhaps when the 3rd Imperium becomes 
more mature it will be building these ships, but in it\'s infancy I don\'t 
think so.

Did you every try and pilot a fighter against one of those monsters?

The ship my characters are flying about in my game is a 120ton 
exploration gunboat (in TNE)  Its got the entire sensor loadout, a missle 
bay, two laser turrets and a sandcaster.  With a crew of eleven, it\'s not 
 even large enough to find a corner to pout in quietly, but it\'s perfect 
for PC\'s.  There\'s enough NPC\'s around to keep the kibitzing rolling, and 
unlike the S-Class Scout, it\'s not likely to get shot down by the first 
farmer with a musket.

Absolutely, if you can\'t role play the fight, what\'s the point of the

As the major powers exsusted their crew reserves to fight in the
Rebellion. The navies had to rely on more autonimous ship systems. This
resulted in computers gaining a rudimentary self awareness. When the
war was fought for logical objectives and means, the semi-selfaware
ships were "happy" to blast other semi-selfaware ships.

The "Black War" changed that! The War had degenerated to outright
revenge and cruelty. Many computers suffered a nervous breakdown.
Some commited suicied. Some decided to wipeout the true virus: mankind.
Still others decided to control the technology that mankind could have.

Same reason we all want and mainframe.  Play multi player doom. 8)  

Not wanting to start another flame war here.

There\'s only one real answer to that question and it\'s the same reason 
men date women.  Procreation.  Like all lifeforms Virus\'s two main 
desires are:

1) self preservation and
2) procreation.

Through a mainframe the Virus could potentialy infect many more 
computers.

No it didn\'t and I\'m not arguing that there wouldn\'t be a few of these

I think depending on the travel times from 100D to the starport, 2 trips a
month is probably very good.  I\'d guess the number would be closer to 3
trips every 2 months.

I seem to remember this to be a major issue a month or so ago.  Lots of hot

Yeah, but protestantism thrived during the times of the most persecution.
But I do see your point here.

Trade RULES are not what I\'m talking about.  I\'m talking about the idea of a
person in Traveller 1. being able to afford a grav car (much less a
starship), 2. the idea that people with a higher technology level (and thus
an assumedly higher education factor) would accept living under a nobility
structure without any control for themselves (look at the modern democratic
reforms), and 3. The idea that a bank will lend someone the money to buy a
starship and expect to get that money back!  (This is my biggest complaint!)

Anyway, I\'m not talking about rules, I\'m talking about background issues.

That\'s my point right there!  Jump Drive (FTL into another dimension taking
1wk on average no matter how far you go) is probably considered a silly
notion by the physicists who study FTL, but in Trav we must keep it because
1. it is a a plot device, and 2. since it was included in previous editions,
we can\'t change it without changing background!

>> The military and ex-military among us find the combat rules obscene.

Right, but this is one of those things that can be changed by changing the
rules.  I put it here because it serves as an example.  I don\'t know about
CT, but I know the combat rules (and I assume the lethality) has changed
from MT to TNE.  My point is that everyone has their own idea of what is the
best, most realistic version of combat.

This is what TNE did, and got blasted because HEPLAR (I never remember which
ones to cap) wasn\'t cannon, that is, it didn\'t agree with previous versions!

True, but it would still effect the background seriously!

It would be a big deal if you left it out, or even if you changed it.  The
effects on the background would be devestating!  (Reread the Jump torp
debate if you don\'t believe me!)

See above.  My arguement is not so much the rules as it is the ideas in the
background.

Agreed, but it was a good try! ;)

I only find one major problem with the Virus, and that is the problem with
sensors and comm units being receivers.  I also don\'t see that Virus is
*integral* to the background.  A number of people have argued that Virus
wasn\'t necessary because of the devestation from the Black War.

I agree about the sensors.  (BTW, this is something that has changed over
the course of this debate.)  I see your point about the comm links as well,
but this method of entry would be limited to the types of Virus that could
immitate Human run ships.  The key to comm link infection according to
Survival Margin was the computer controlled communications.  I\'ll post
quotes of the description of this if you\'d like.

Transponders (from 1086) were standardized in the Imperium, and this was the
"ace in the hole" for the Virus.  Transponders were connected to the
communications equipment and to the computer core.  This enabled the Virus
to lodge itself into another computer system that contained a transponder
(starports, starships, and spacecraft).  From there Virus would infect the
whole system.

Agreed, I changed the word activated to the word executed in the sentence
above, but that still doesn\'t convey the message.  I think what I was trying
(and failing miserably) to get across was that Virus didn\'t need human
interaction to be executed.

I see what you\'re saying.  I think I may have not understood what others
were arguing about the PRO-VIRUS issues, but after recently rereading parts
of Survival Margin, I think I have a few better explanations of why
PRO-VIRUS is possible.

I think this arguement is more an arguement of how widely spread in
non-Imperial areas.  There are many arguements on both sides, but this post
is getting long.  I still have some questions, and I\'d like to know what the
ANIT-VIRUS people think about some of the explanationa in Survival Margin.
I DON\'T WANT TO GET INTO A PROLONGED ARGUEMENT ABOUT VIRUS, but some of the
things I thought before have changed, and I\'m interested in finding out
more. (Add a bit of computer knowledge to my Jack-of-all-Trades skill! ;)

I\'ll post some of the stuff from Survival Margin later to get some
responces, but please remember, I\'m not trying to argue, just to understand!

Well I\'m not sure what I thinl, but I think that there Solomani might 
receive a fairly cold welcome from the RC if they continued their old 
ways.

Not arguing that the RC are equally sneaky, but the RC are neither 
Xenophobic or bigoted.  Infact they despise xenophobic societies as they 
serve no one and from all evidence I\'ve seen they welcome the insight of 
alien cultures.

As to other Pocket Empires there are two known examples, Empire of Solee, 
which they eventually destroy and Covenant of Suffern, which they 
probably form a parnership with or eventually absorb as and equal 
partner.  Now the point here is these two PE\'s have radically different 
views on expansion into the wilds.  Suffern says, "Would you like to 
join?  No, that\'s a shame, well talk to you later."  Where as Solee says, 
"If you don\'t join willingly I\'ve got two SEH Cruisers parked in orbit 
and we\'ll make you join."

Basically the RC beleives that every society has the right to chose as 
long as they\'re not going against the will of the people.  If the people 
want one thing and the government is a tyrnaical despot then watch out.  
If the governement is open and friendly then there\'ll be peaceful 
relationships for years to come.

I recently drove across the Golden Gate Bridge.  How did that bridge get there?

asphalt, speed limit signs, and surly toll booth attendants.

B>  The sentient Earth, seeing the growth of San Francisco, raised the
bridge from the mud of the Bay.

No, before we got here, the Golden Gate ran "according to its programming",
running tides, looking scenic as fuck.  Once we "Virus people" showed up, we
began altering things to suit ourselves.  We\'ve filled in large portions of
the Bay, built an artificialisland or two, diverted rivers, and built nine
bridges.

That is how Virus operates!

Now, as for the incompatible system arguement. (Tip of the Vaccsuit helmet
to Bill Turnbow for this.)

An Imperial Vampire is cruising through a system when it encounters an Aslan
vessel.  Tries to infect it. Fails, due to the different systems.  Proceeds
to blast the Aslan ship to wreckage (for the sake of arguement).  Vampire
then sends robots to inspect the wreckage, while it accesses all the known
library data about Aslan computers.

Same ship, a month later.  Encounters an Aslan merchant during refueling.
Opens a hailing channel, Aslan answers.  the Vampire then sends its "child"
a copy of itself *designed to work on the Aslan computer system* at the
merchie.  If it works, goodbye Hierate, if not, kill the merchant and back
to the virtual drawing board.

Virus is sentient.  Intellegent.  Got\'s a load o\'brainpower.  It will infect
your systems, it won\'t stop, don\'t you understand? That\'s all it does!!!

Hate to tell you this, but basic principals can change.  One example is in
*my* area of expertise, weapons.  We now are experimenting with liquid
propellent guns.  Unbelievable muzzle energy, much cleaner, and almost no
muzzle flash.  If this works out, gunpowder might join the buggy whip on
history\'s back shelf.  The idea was first thought 30 years ago, but was
dismissed as impossible "due to the basic principals of chemistry" (Jane\'s
Defence Annual, 1995)

So you admit to using a poorly explained, unrealistic plot device to further

Men also studied aerodynamics and flew toy gliders and kites for several
thousand years.  But it wasn\'t until the technology existed for the Wright
Brothers that man actually flew.  Even then, we found that many of our basic
assumptions were wrong.

I find this to be the most annoying thing in this thread.  We are talking
about THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS.  In 1700BCE, do you think anyone
could even conceive of what we have now?  That was the Bronze age.. the
concept of STEEL was unknown.  All their "basic assumptions" were based on
the strength of bronze.  If you described the Golden Gate Bridge to the
finest engineers of the Middle Kingdom, they would tell you that this was
impossible, and could never be done.

All of the things GDW claimed Virus could do are POSSIBLE (not necessarily
PROBABLE).  Virus (assuming it is what GDW says it is (e.g.) a
semi-sentient life form, that can manipulate raw silicon around it to grow
and replicate) could spread from ship to ship quite easily using the Deyo
Chip.  Since it already is the lifeform, it could manipulate the silicon
around it and create more life, (e.g.) the mainframe.  Now given that (and
it is a big given mind you), it becomes possible for Virus to infect via
Deyo Chips.  Given the electronic nature of Virus, it once again is
possible that it could attach to another computer, and through remote
execution (done all the time BTW) could load up and execute a basic EGG if
you will that would begin the rudimentary life process of Virus. 
Unfortunately we have to assume that Virus can exist in any silicon that
can be modified.  This of course could be changed for the appropriate
Computer Hardware of the 57th Century.  The end result is that since most
computers are used to allowing external access to themselves, and many
even now allow limited remote execution, it would be possible to create an
EGG that could hatch after being executed by the other infected computer
into a Virus.

Now is any of this possible?  Most likely not in our current understanding
of Computes.  However, in the 57th Century Computers may very well follow
different standards than today.  The whole architecture internally may be
self-repairing/biological/etc which could make this whole scenario more
likely.

Now for the last bit.  I send this message because I am VERY SICK of this
thread, and it seemed that the only people still talking about it were the
Virus bashers.  Whether you like Virus or not DOESN\'T MATTER to me ONE
BIT!!!  If you want to discuss the potential for it in a reasoned way,
then lets take it private.  I also am a computer professional, and can
discuss this in a reasoned manner.  Flame Wars get us nowhere, and waste
everyone else\'s time and bandwidth.

So with that I will Duck (whoosh) and Cover da da dum, Duck (whoosh) and
Cover...

1 of the AOL conferences had somebody (Ken Whitman I believe), saying

True. It\'s too bad the factors combined to require such speed in creating 
this system.  It\'s not IG\'s fault, either - they didn\'t get the rights to 
Traveller until GDW went out of business (and, no, I\'m not saying it\'s 
GDW\'s fault!  read on...), which was just early this year.  When IG and 
FFE got together to do this project, several established companies 
already had their own sci fi games on the drawing board.  IG and FFE 
wanted to beat them to market (which is a strategy I whole-heartedly 
support).   If they would have stuck with a slightly revamped CT, MT, or 
TNE, they could have done it, without too many errors.

But, they chose to involve us in the process, and we had a lot of really 
good input.  That input will make a better product.  But if it slows 
product introduction by much, Traveller could miss its window of 
opportunity.  So, they stuck to their production schedule (for the most 
part) and tried to add the suggestions as well.

They\'re walking a tightrope, and I hope they make it to the other side 
without falling! 

BTW, I browsed through FF&S last night, and I have to admit that having 
a cleaned-up FF&S available for T4 is A Good Thing.  This book is 
amazing.  Sure, there are problems with it, but if it\'s cleaned up it 
will be phenominal.  

Of course, if you have FF&S you have to have something simpler, too, 
which gets us back to the problem of getting the best product out in the 
shortest possible time.  As long as SSDS and QSDS /work/, things aren\'t 
that bad.  Second editions can come out, with corrections, but only if 
the original product does well.  I\'ve worked with QSDS rather a lot over 
the last few weeks, and I\'m satisfied it works.  I\'m sure SSDS is just as 
workable.  Both systems could be improved (what system can\'t?), but given 
the timeframe that Guy and David had to work with, the systems as they 
exist are very impressive.  I think those who buy T4 won\'t be 
disappointed.

Marc obviously wants to differentiate Traveller from the other two "legs" 
of the Sci-Fi tripod, and I think you are correct that this is a good way 
to add to that effort.  ST is heavily biased toward huge ships with huge 
crews, while SW was biased toward single-crew (or double, including the 
R2-D2 units) fighters.  Considering Traveller\'s role-playing roots (look 
at me, I\'m already talking as if Traveller were some major media force!), 
the small-crew ships emphasis is the right way to go.  Good thought.

Right.

There\'s always that. :)  But, you know me...always trying to spoon feed 
the (assumed) hordes of new role-players T4 is going to attract. :)

Maybe, in the interest of providing proper support for new players, T4\'s 
boxed set should also include a computer, modem, and internet 
account, along with directions for subscribing to the Traveller mailing 
lists. :) :)

Hmmm.  True, that would work.  Personally, though, I try not to make 
commands-from-on-high like that.  I\'m sneakier, so I try to rig the 
system to prevent whatever player behavior I don\'t like. :P

I\'m not saying my way is better...just different.  On that note, I\'ll 
mention that I will be working on the aging rules this weekend (using the 
last table I posted - unchanged -, with various DM\'s and a text 
explanation).  I\'ll post it when I get done.

        OK. As somebody pointed out, I may haven\'t gotten beaten up enough
on SSDS, but I\'ve still been very leery of getting involved with this
discussion. Nevertheless, here goes:

        Using the transponder chips, it is NOT necessary to have a physical
interface crawl from one transponder to the other. ALL these chips are
"bred" from some kind of "living" chip which preyed on other chips REMOTELY!
No physical connection needed. So, everybody who\'s arguing about different
logic systems, microcode architecture, etc. is forgetting one thing:

        EVERY SINGLE IMPERIAL SHIP HAD A COMMON INTERFACE AT THE
TRANSPONDER! And other states\' ships which dealt in the Imperium were
required to have them as well.

        So Virus was GUARANTEED that it had an entry point into a ship\'s
system which it understood and knew. And it was GUARANTEED that that entry
point was capable of supporting an AI Virus. From there it was a matter of
entering the rest of the ship\'s system. Since the transponder, in order to
perform its function of reporting where a ship had been, what it had done,
etc. already had access to the rest of the ship\'s computers and had learned
its ship\'s own internal logic system, once Virus managed to take over the
transponder, it knew everything it needed to grab the rest of the system.

        As it happens, I wasn\'t buying everything from Survival Margin, and
definitely not TNE, but I liked the idea of Virus. So I threw out parts of
the explanation I didn\'t like. And I didn\'t need it ... my players were
playing AFTER Virus had destroyed civilization. They had no records of how
it worked, and no real way of finding out ... so I just told them the effects.

        Now, dodging herbivore feces and organically-decayed foodstuffs for
continuing the Thread That Wouldn\'t Die, I return you to your regularly
scheduled discussion of SSDS.

        I guess I never had too much trouble with the "executing the code
part" ONCE I read the full explanation (\'course, I had trouble with a lot of
that). But when you remember that EVERY IMPERIAL SHIP had a Deyo
transponder, which was a "sentient" chip, and Virus was the SAME SPECIES of
chip (*not* originally a computer program, d****it), Virus was GUARANTEED a
compatible way into the system. From there it could write its own code to
infect the rest of the ship.

        And the transponder KNEW how to interface with the rest of the ship
... it had to to perform its function

        That\'s the crux of GDW\'s explanation of Virus. It DIDN\'T originally
transmit a program, and hope the COMPUTER at the other end would be
compatible and stupid enough to execute it. It used an existing mechanism to
alter the TRANSPONDER at the other end, and from there take over the
computer. Remember, the transponders were continuously talking to each other.

Oh, great.  I can see the posters now:  "You want Traveller?  You can\'t

A little overdub of that scene in the movie, and they\'d have a

        Incidentally, I remember from WAY back when an individual on one of

memory is more faulty than not (lots of bad sectors not marked off).

I have to admit I never have done that - and I\'ve never had a player who 
did.  But then, our space battles were almost all one-on-one, with 
400-ton or smaller ships. 

I think it was Mr. Broussard who said he was going to prove that massive 
amounts of fighters were the way to win a space battle (but I could be 
mis-remembering).  I\'d like to hear more about this...

> Absolutely, if you can\'t role play the fight, what\'s the point of the 
> game.

The only time I can remember being involved with huge warships was during 
one of our two greatest campaigns of all time (this one was in the Gamma 
World/Star Trek The Role Playing Game/Star Fleet Battles/House Rules 
hybrid game run by my best friend back in 82 or so; the other greatest 
campaign was one of my Traveller campaigns, of course. :).  My character 
had essentially conquered Earth, using his charisma, knowledge, and 
military tactics to convert or destroy every intelligent species in the 
Gamma World setting.  He (my character, "Stranger,") then had an NPC 
("Janitor" (pronounced Jani-tore), a really neat all-purpose self-aware 
robot that the GM used to great advantage in furthering many plots) 
repair a decaying space ship.  Over the course of play, my character 
became the Admiral of a fairly large fleet of ships knocking about, 
conquering the galaxy.  

Anyway, the campaign got pretty boring once Stranger had this huge ship and 
its crew (not to mention his whole fleet) at his disposal.  His skills 
didn\'t matter much anymore.  He said "Do this," and it was done.  He had 
sub-lieutenants for everything (it was a really tight, totally loyal 
organization).  Maybe it was just our ages (we were 13 or 14 then), but 
the driving force of the campaign disappeared about then, and we set it 
aside (in favor of another go at Traveller, which I spoke of in one of 
the first posts I made to XTML).

So, I\'ve avoided such situations in my own campaigns.  Players stick with 
small ships and small crews (rarely more than one or two NPCs).  It\'s 
worked for us, anyway.

Okay, as usual in a debate of this type, one side is talking 
about apples and the other side is talking about pineapples, 
and the apple guys are insisting that you can\'t run pinecones 
with your apples.  Or something like that. 
 
As I see Virus attacks: Virus, to attach anything, *must* 
already be running on a CPU somewhere, whether it is a 
native Deyo chip, a previously-taken over ship\'s computer, 
or a hitherto unknown-to-be-infected chip in that frammistat 
control system you just turned on... 
 
To attack an uncontrolled system, the CPU on which the Virus 
is already running (hereafter called the "Virus CPU") *must* 
be in communication with the target CPU.  This is consistant 
with canon. Once you have that, no "magic" or illogical-according 
- -to-current-knowledge assumptions are required; Virus just 
plays Super Hacker. It\'s got what it takes--an intimate knowledge 
of computer architectures, high intelligence, infinite patience 
and persistance (It has literally nothing better to do), and 
it doesn\'t have to stop to go to the bathroom or get another Jolt 
cola out of the fridge. And it operates at TL16+ computer speeds, 
not human thought speeds.  Like I said, Super Hacker. 
 
The target CPU must have some means of communicating with the 
outside world and accepting commands; without that, it\'s just 
an expensive electronic sock warmer.  If Virus can access that 
communication/command channel/socket/frequency/blah/blah/blah, 
sooner or later it can hack its way in and take over the target 
CPU.   
 
Now, what\'s so hard to believe about that?

Yes, but most Impy computer systems are capable of doing a hell 
of a lot in accordance with their programming.

If your PC is hooked to the Internet, and running a real OS like 
linux, someone could write a worm that would exploit a security 
hole to get itself root access, download a C64 emulator, and  
then run the C64 program in it...  Given (a) communications access, 
(b) imperfect security, and (c) enough capability in the target system 
to actually do anything useful, you can do all kinds of interesting 
things.   
 
It is hypothesized that the only perfect security is that of 
having no outside communications at all, which makes the system 
useless, of course.  Therefore, if there is an external method 
of control, security is, by definition, imperfect.

(a) Security is inversely proportional to ease-of-use. 
(b) New technology introduces new security problems. 
(c) Computers are built of real, physical hardware, not abstract 
machines. Data *can* affect hardware; there is a moderately well 
known example from the early days of the space program where a 
repetitive, tight loop being executed within a CPU caused dopant  
migration sufficient to cripple the CPU in a satellite. They 
fixed it by sending it instructions for another tight loop that 
reversed the dopant migration.  Note that it wasn\'t what the 
instructions told it to do that caused the damage, it was the 
repetitive bit pattern set in the CPU\'s transistors. A repetitive 
data stream of the same type would have caused the same damage.

Are you so sure they haven\'t been tried?  A successful security 
breach, like the perfect crime, is never detected as such. 
 
>Psionics is not explainable. More or less by definition. :-) 
 
It also exists in the real world, though not with the fine 
precision and scientific training of Traveller psionics. 
 
As for Virus, well, you\'ve seen my argument on why it makes 
perfect sense.  My argument has always been with the *way* it 
was used as a plot device, not that it existed, or whether 
or not it could do what was attributed to it. 
 
If you\'d like to elaborate on various points, or argue points 
I left undeveloped, please do.  But stop dogmatically insisting 
that Virus is illogical. It\'s not.

Why?  Are such worlds also restricting all hazardous cargos  
from being carried on ships through the atmosphere?  I can imagine 
some sad excuse for a technophobic, xenophobic society making 
such laws, but I can\'t see that as being a general reason for 
not building fission-plant powered ships.

If it is widely used, ships and fueling facilities will be designed 
such that removing spent fuel rods and replacing them will be 
less trouble than pulling an engine from a 747 and putting a new 
one in.  Cost is reflected in fuel costs.

Why balance it?  Isn\'t the Sylean edge supposedly the better  
fusion plants at TL12?  Who cares if TL11 fission plants are 
better than TL11 fusion plants?

Rafm is talking to Imperium Games.  The chap I spoke to said things were
positive, and that they had a good feeling about IG\'s commitment to
Traveller.  

Their current line is still available at 1995 prices (given in Challenge 77).
 They have just moved, so will not ship any orders until late July, but their
address is:

Rafm
20 Parkhill Road East
Cambridge, Ontario
Canada

No net address, but you could phone them.  (Use directory assistance - I
don\'t have the number here now.)

I have (or have on order) all their miniatures.  Their prices are terrific
(remember $1 US = $1.5 Cdn), and they ship the same week -- I can post an
order on Thursday and have it in my classroom the next Wednesday!

It is a very large display that "doubles the population of Columbus for a few 
hours."  It is done somewhere downtown (the Conv. Center is downtown also),

So, if you are going to Origins on Wednesday night, you might want to think

Actually, the money was contributed directly from school lunch money.

>From Supplement 5: Lightning Class Cruisers:
"The Duke of Regina, speaking for the Marches, proposed that the 
Marches fund one additional ship from its own resources, on the 
condition that the Marches receive the contract to produce a portion 
of the total run.  The school children of the worlds within the 
Marches contributed from their lunch money, at a quarter credit each, 
for the ultimate funding of one ship, and it was named Children of 
the March in their honor."

If this had happened in 20th century US, there\'d have been an 
investigation to find out why money from the education budget was 
spent on defense.

I suspect there wasn\'t much of a flap in the Imperium at the time 
though... :-)

For any discrete-state machine (e.g., non-analog) -- yes, it *is* always
possible.  This is the fundamental Turing Theorem, which indicates that
*any* discrete algorithm can be implemented on *any* discrete computing
device with the capabilities of a "Universal Turing Machine" --
essentially, a finite state machine having an infinite store and some
(relatively small) number N of states available.  That "infinite" store is
the sticking point, but in practice for any given algorithm the required
storage is bounded. 

What all this means in practice is that any program can be translated 
from any architecture to any other architecture.  As a worst case, you 
simply build a program which emulates architecture A on architecture B, 
and run A programs on B using *that*.  Interestingly, that\'s precisely 
what has been done on the recent Atari 2600 games made available for the 
IBM PC -- a modern PC is so much faster than the 2600 was, they just 
rigged up a full 2600 emulator, hardware registers and all, and ran the 
original 2600 game program binaries almost without modification on top of 
it.  Pretty amazing stuff...

In both cases, you\'re probably overlooking the highly likely different
character set imposed by the intermingling of vilani influences...Where
modern english differs mostly in spelling and clutural ideomatic
expressions (one of shakespear\'s greatest problems for the modern reader is
his constant punning and slang derived double ententres), Sylean would have
over a millenia of borrowed terms, added characters, and half a milenia of
quasi-isolated evolution...

I assume that there are five "Common Languages" in the late third imperium,
nearly a milenium later than (IIUC) the question refers to... Old HHigh
Vilani, Solomani Anglic, Old Sylean, Galanglic, and Modern Vilani; of
these, Galanglic speakers can converse intelligibly (with great care) with
all but old high vilani... and those who speak modern vilani can converse
(with some care) with those who speak Old High Vilani, a tongue spoken only
within the Vilani Cultureal region, and mostly by the nobility and educated
elites...

If we assume DGP and GDW\'s flowing arabesque scripts are modern vilani or
galanglic, old texts would be indecipherable to "modern readers", due to
the different character set. And just for reference, the Solmani in My
imperium use the Unifon alphabet (See science 87, don\'t remember which
issue).

I doubt that Galanglic uses a variant character set.  Given that Galanglic
is descended from Anglic, which is evidently English plus assorted other
Terran-language influences (most of which probably use the Latin alphabet:
Arabic is just not going to be that influential, Chinese is just ideographs
so far, Japanese katakana and Slavic cyrillic characters are already 
readily and frequently transliterated), the Galanglic character set will
almost surely (IMHO) consist of English/Latin letters, possibly with some 
understood variant pronunciations for consonant clusters ("zd", etc.)
representing transliterations from Vilani, Sylean, Luriani, or whatever
else gets picked up along the way.  Okay, I might grant you a French 
cedilla, a Spanish tilde, and maybe a few other assorted accents and
modifiers.  Maybe even a few "new" letters in some dialects to simplify
combinations like "sh" and "th".  But the basic structure and character
of the alphabet, particularly if literacy isn\'t lost during the Long
Night, should remain constant.

English changed so much after the Norman occupation precisely _because_
there was no written form of the language (in fact, that\'s when we got
rid of all our declensions!).  The Second Imperium is likely to be a
two-tier language system, using both Anglic (for upper-level dealings)
and Vilani (for dealings with occupied populaces), with those who want
to advance in society learning the occupiers\' language.  Thus it\'s much
like the eighteenth/nineteenth-century colonial empires.  But each language
will maintain its original alphabet, and change only in vocabulary and
style.

Actually, I think MT materials differentiated between assorted dialects 
of Galanglic: Riftian (Deneb, etc.), Transform (Antares), um, ?Core?,
and Rim (Solomani Rim and Old Expanses).  Modern Vilani incorporates
many other influences, and Old High Vilani is the original, First-
Imperium dialect.  Old Sylean was never heard of until Lucan\'s 
pronouncements (which I never quite understood).  Likewise, the Darmine 
cultural region maintained its original language (which was from a
minor race with millenia of independent and uninfluenced development).

I\'d very much like to see the Unifon alphabet.  How about a web page?
The illustrations probably are of Vilani (or, actually, just deliberately
"alien" so the artist doesn\'t have to distract the viewer with mundanities
like "Restrooms", "Customs", and such).

On this same note, has anyone else noticed that the Vilani language, as 
presented in CT and MT materials, contains no letter "V"?  The published
language tables allow initial consonants K, G, M, D, L, SH, KH, N, S, P, 
B, Z, and R.  I\'ve always wondered if we should be talking about the 
"Bilani" from "Bland" instead....  :-)

Why? Why? Why!

I *know* the transponder performed IFF.  I know the canon 3I
*required* it on ships.  I know, I know, but I\'m sneaky, paranoid, and
distrustful...so are my players..we NEVER liked transponders, we never
trusted transponders.  There\'s no way we\'d give a transponder any
*real* access to the ship\'s systems, not in my universe anyway.  <g> 

We didn\'t want authorities knowing where we\'d been, what we\'d been
doing, even exactly who we were most of the time.  I remember the very
first session where I brought up the required transponder for IFF, and
the players *immediately* started looking for ways to isolate and
spoof it.

Well, my question about language seems to have opened up a bit of a
debate.  Part of the problem seems to have been that my question was a bit
broad (didn\'t want to give away too much about the adventure :-).  Let me
make a more specific query: If characters from the Sylean Federation
(milieu 0) happened upon a base from the late Second Imperium/Rule of Man
(i.e., just before the Long Night), would they be able to read the signs
and button labels therein? 

Thanks,

I\'ve pretty much come to a number of conclusions about the entire Virus 
issue.

1)  The "Virus is plausable" side will never convince the "Virus is a 
load of bunk" side, other wise.

2) The "Virus is a load of bunk" side will never convince the "Virus is 
plausable" side, other wise.

3) Discussing Virus is kinda like going to "Die Hard" or "Speed" with my 
dad.  "You can\'t do that to an Elevator!  That\'s impossible!"  Or 
watching a train movie with my father in law, "see above quote."

Which brings me to one conclusion and one conclusion only.  Those beleive 
in Virus will continue to do so no matter how much the physicists and 
computer scientists argue it is impossible and those who don\'t beleive 
will continue to disbeleive for their own reasons.

Virus is a plot device, a theoretical concept.  If people wish to discuss 
the possiblities of virus and variations there in, the people who 
disbelieve should allow them to continue on in blissful ignorence, 
there\'s nothing worse than watching a movie with a technical expert 
beside you, ask my wife she\'ll tell you all about it.  If the people who 
disbeleive wish to discuss why the whole thing is just so much whooie 
then they should be allowed to do so and never shall the two meet again.

I\'m not suggesting a total ban on the subject, if the person you\'re 
talking to just isn\'t willing to see your point of view then perhaps it\'s 
best to just drop it and let things go.  We don\'t want everyone to get 
off the net remarking on what a total idiot so-\'n-so is, its counter 
productive.

I\'ve always been into small ships.  I remember playing the Star Trek RPG

Oh well, that\'s out then, I\'ve got a PC.  

I found an old copy (ver 4.5) of Corel Draw yesterday, I\'ll give that
a try.  I also found a $3 draw simple houseplans program that saves to
EPS format that might do the trick.

I checked at heliograph last night and the deckplans weren\'t there. 
It is http://www.heliograph.com/space1889.htm isn\'t it?

What? you don\'t have a copy of Microsoft\'s new Neural ScanDisk.  It only

Ah... but there are no tables for TL11 fission plants and no defined rules for
fission power plants, period.  If TL11 fission plants exist, they might very
well be superior to their TL8 ancestors (and *that much better* than TL11 fusion
plants).  There should be reasons for describing a piece of technology as
"surpassed" (but not necessarily obsolete), just like there was an explanation
why helicopters were surpassed by air/rafts at TL8 (CT) or 10 (TNE).

All that I was asking of Dave Golden was for one or two sentences to be included
in SSDS explaining the downsides of fission power in the Traveller universe.  I
haven\'t seen anyone design a vessel with a fission power plant with the new
rules yet.  Nor have I seen many vessels built using anything but TL12
technology (to gain the advantages of both fusion "plus" and thruster plates).
If the Imperium is truly at TL11/12 in Milieu 0, it will probably be dedicating
most of its TL12 shipyards to the construction of military vessels, leaving the
lower-tech yards to build the traders, liners, etc.  As a matter of perspective,
the Spinward Marches (circa 1105) had approximately 50 A-class starports... less
than half of them were TL12+ (in an Imperium with a TL of 15).

If the Starships book includes a number of fission-powered TL11 vessels, the
"feel" of the Traveller universe will also be altered.  This will be most
noticeable to players who have been using fuel-scoops on their TL10
Beowulf-class free traders for nearly twenty years (even the fusion plant in
TNE\'s TL10 version is impossible according to the SSD System  8-)

I just don\'t know.  It might have accelerated the development of
computationally intensive research/development items, but it *might*

I\'m not sure that analysis is correct.  See Capt. Roger Villar, Piracy
Today:  Robbery and Violence at Sea Since 1980 (1985).  Villar reports on
hundreds of pirate attacks, mostly in coastal waters or ports in the third
world.  

I think that merchant ships don\'t carry deck guns because the coast guards,
customs departments, and navies of the world want a monopoly on lawful
firepower.  They can at least control the firepower of merchant ships, so
they know that when they want to board a merchant for inspection or
whatever, there won\'t be a Exocet surprise (nor even a 40mm Bofors).  They
can\'t control the pirates, of course, but they expect to shoot and be shot
at in those encounters.

I haven\'t looked up the law, but I\'ll bet that U.S.-registered merchant
ships are limited in weapons to what their personnel may legally carry,
which is very small small arms.  The rest of the world is probably more
restrictive.

Another factor is that much of the piracy is done by police and naval forces
themselves (again, the examples that I\'ve read of are all in the third
world).  They don\'t want their victims adequately armed, and get their
governments to support any international agreements on disarming private ships.

Finally, much of modern piracy is of types that serious deck guns won\'t
deter:  attacks on vessels too small to sport heavy weapons and night-time
boarding operations in or near port by pirates on small boats.  The usual
objective of modern piracy is theft of cargo, not theft of the whole ship.
Ship-stealing is very difficult to make profitable because of extensive ship
registration procedures and dissemination of registry information.

Unconfirmed rumors is that while supertankers and other mass shipping do 
not carry mounted weapons, they do use mobile weapons like assult rifles 
and rocket launchers. The law of the sea as far as I know allows this, 
they must be secured in a gun locker while in port. 

Piracy in the third world is a serios problem, especially for Australians 
as a majority of our trade goes past problem areas (Vietnam, Cambodia, 
Malaysia, Philapenes). The repected navies of the area do patrol for 
pirates, but since 80% use small power boats and the areas involved are 
dirt poor, Piracy is a way of life. 

In Traveller, ALL piracy would happen in N-space, so all a pirate would need 
a vessel with m-drive and a big gun. Given the nature of the impirium, 
the nessasary structure for piracy would be in place (corrupt officials, 
small cutters and insystem ships readily available. merchents willing to 
finance the operation). For a good look at piracy and commerce raiding in 
a interstellar society, read David Webber\'s new book "Honor among Enemies".

of Education will be installing a really nice computer network at my school. 
Fibre-optic backbone, four drops per class, 15 megs per student and staff
member capacity in the file server, supports our current Macs, Windows-PCs,
and SGI UNIX workstations.  Will also link in with Board office, so we can
get Internet access, video-conferencing, and attendance and marks can be sent
electronically.  Sounds fun.

Problem is, the A/V tech told me (10 minutes before I left the building) that
there were not going to install security unless there was a proven need (ie.
I could demonstrate that a break-in had occurred).  Now, even though I am the
system administrator I am mainly self-taught (money for equipment and outside
consultants, no money for staff training) and do not know all the fiddly
details.  However, if I understand the technical literature correctly, I
should be able to hook up a packet sniffer and monitor the network for
administartion-level passwords.  (No zone segmentation, and no physical
security on unconnected drops.)

I\'m off on holiday today, back Thursday, leave again Sunday, back in August. 
They plan to start installing in August.  And all my manuals are now locked
up (because I\'m officially on holiday).

If any of you know details about network security, could you please email me
(rob_prior@nynet.nybe.north-york.on.ca) with some suggestions?  Given the
program head\'s attitude towards student hackers ("He\'s really smart, and he\'s
promised not to do it again, so we\'re giving him another chance.") I can
count on having several known destructive hackers. As I will be teaching a
full load of classes (and developing two new courses while doing so) as well
as running the network, I won\'t have a lot of spare time during the winter. 
But something in me says that they need better security when they are keeping
attendance and marks records on the same system that students use for their
work.  If I can give my non-technically-inclined principal a list of security
holes and possible fixes by Friday she will have some ammunition when the
paid consultants say "wait for the problem before fixing it". (They get paid
once the system is installed, and promised support is really lacking.)

Sorry for bothering the list with this.

Other, related cultural differences can "get" players too.

As you point out, the government may turn out to be a "government of
men, not laws". But it\'s also possible to have a legal system of
*either* type where the bureaucracy is important. For example, there
are places right here on earth where it is not merely *expected* that
you slip officials some money to expedite your business, but where that
is how they get paid!

This *isn\'t* bribery. It\'s perfectly legal under their laws. But
picture the poor player who doesn\'t realize that the customs inspector
*lives* off his "tips". The official won\'t refuse to inspect the cargo,
that\'d be illegal. But he sure as hell will put you at the end of the
list! 

For that matter, offering the guy a *bribe* (ie trying to pay him to
ignore the rules) could get you in serious trouble! That\'s a
distibction most Westerner\'s just don\'t get. And from the outside it
*does* look a lot like the "laws don\'t matter, people do" type of
place. 

Or picture them trying to deal with something like the Chinese Mandarin
system. That system would fit under *several* different goverment types
and law levels. The main focus is the status quo, thus *procedure*
(ritual, if you will) is more important than anything else. If you
think the bureaucrats in *our* government agencies can get picky, you
ain\'t seen nothing yet.

Yet depending on the "legal culture", they might well accept money to
let you break the rules. But trying to get them to *expedite* something
may get you in trouble. :-)

BTW, the "mandarin" types quite likely have established procedure
(which must be followed!) for bribing them!

The densest *elements* are osmium and iridium. Platinum and several
other elements aren\'t far behind. Since platimum, osmium and iridium
are all "noble metals" and chemically similar to boot, they tend to be
found mixed in nuggets. Figure the density to be in the neighborhood of
20-23 g/cc.

Other dense items are gold (19.3), mercury (13.6) and lead (11.3). But
only gold is likely to be found as anything but ore. 

Most ores are a lot less dense. Still, ores of heavier elements tend to
be denser than average rocks. I have some chunks of "peacock ore"
(copper/silver ore) that are almost as heavy as a chunk of iron the
same size! Galena is pretty dense too.

Uranium ore isn\'t quite so dense, but I think that\'s because it tends
to be more complex silcates rather than simple sulfides or oxides.

Given *normal* elemental abundances, I\'d say that copper/silver/etc
ores are the most likely to be found in big deposits. (A lot of these
may have started out as "black smoker" fields at mid-ocean rifts).

Another source of big, dense items is the buried remains of nickel-iron
meteors. The Sudbury nickel mines in Ontario are thought to be such a
deposit. 

Now these are the answers for a "normal" planet. For something closer
to the star (like Mercury), the *average* density goes *way* up, simply
because all the lighter elements have been baked out.

Asteriods could be anything. And if they are the remains of a planet
(even a smaller one) that got disrupted by tidal forces or the like,
you may find fragments of deep mantle or even core material. These will
be *very* dense rocks. Not as dense as platinum or gold (unless it was
a *big* planet, which is hard to justify the breakup of), but pretty
dense, Such minerals may contain crystals not found elsewhere. They
could be gemstobes, or have special applications (Murray Leinster had
a story where crystals from the core/mantle boundary area where
required for the thruster plate type drive in the story).

Look at it this way. it\'s 1996 now. Shakespeare was mid 1600s and is
quite readable (in fact, he\'s considered to be using "modern" English).
But Chaucer, back in the 1300s or 1400s is Middle English and *real*
hard to read. Go back to 1100-1000 and you are into Old English (aka
Anglo-Saxon) and it isn\'t readable at all. 

On the other hand, If you can read modern Spanish you can make a pretty
good stab at Latin. For French, Italian, etc (the other Romance
languages) it\'s a bit harder. Yet that\'s a 2000 year span!

Writing slows down language changes. Sound record should slow down
*pronunciation* changes.

It depends on circumstances. Given the few terms in Galanglic we have
from older versions of Traveller, I\'d say that anyone familiar with
Anglic (as I believe it was called at year 0) could read even modern
English with less trouble than we have with Chaucer.

Given the conservatism of the Vilani, I suspect it won\'t have changed
enough to notice.

*However*, the above only applies to places that have maintained a
relatively high tech level the whole time. If the tech level dropped
too far during the Long Night a planet could have a *really*
impenetrable dialect.

Also, while the Syleans will know English/Anglic and Vilani, they may
not know *other* languages that were in use before the Long Night. So
if you need something the players will have fun with, hand them
something in Russian, or better yet, Japanese!

> 4. What is Helium 2, exactly, and does it pose any sort of threat when

Helium 2 would be an isotope of Helium with 2 protons and no neutrons.
It doesn\'t exist. :-)

Helium 3 is an isotope of Helium with 2 protons and 1 neutron. It\'s
probably somewhat radioactive. It makes fusion *much* easier to
accomplish, but it\'s rare.

Helium II (note the roman numerals!) is a form of liquid helium. It
only forms *very* close to absolute zero. It\'s a superfluid. It has
*zero* viscosity. This means that (for example) if you have a beaker
half-full of the stuff, it\'ll crawl up the inside, and flow down the
outside, siphoning itself out of the beaker.! It\'ll also flow thru
*incredibly* tiny holes and cracks. And it is a superconductor of heat.
You *can\'t* boil Helium II. Well, you can\'t get it to "bubble". Instead
it evaporates evenly from the entire surface.

Most of the funny effects are due to it being entirely composed of
Helium 4 (regular helium, 2 protons, 2 neutrons) and cold enough that
quantum effects dominate the interatomic forces. 

Biggest hazard I can see for Helium II is that stepping in a pool of it
would leech heat from your suit faster than hell. It might also be
slippery as hell, though I wouldn\'t swear to it. You\'d probably be safe
from it infiltrating your suit, as long as the inside is warmer than
the He-II.

Anything heavier than iron could be split this way. Howver, the closer
to iron (Fe 56) the *less* energy you can get from a given mass of
material. To get the total energy extractable, figure the number of
nucleons in the mass, divide by 56. Then multiply the result by the
mass of a Fe 56 atom. The difference between the starting and ending
figure is the mass that can be converted into energy.

However, you made one slight goof. it\'s unlikely that the nuclei will
*fission*. Fisssion is an uncomon decay mode. Instead, you are likely
to get a lot of alpha and beta decay chains. Thus, getting the amiount
of energy from the calculation in the previous paragraph is difficult,
if not impossible.

Actually, the best way is to take some transuranic elements and
stabilize them with the damper field. A good choice would be
Californium 254. This is a fissionable element with a critical mass of
less than an *ounce*! Picture the results when the missile impacts,
destroying the damper, and leaving several hundred *kilos* of it
sitting there. :-)

Neutralize the weak force to the point that free neutrons won\'t decay.
Feed neutrons into the field. With a little help from gravatics, you
should be able to get a fairly dense "neutron gas", possibly even a
liquid. I don\'t think even TL 15 is up to creating neutronium. In any
case, when you drop the field on *this* the results should be
gratifying, especially if you *reverse* the field just as you implode
the contents.

I figure the result would be *all* the neutrons converting to an
electron, proton, and anti-neutrino. The densely packed hydrogen
*can\'t* fuse until the damper field drops. If things are set up right,
that\'ll happen at maximum density, and the result ought to make a
regular hydrogen bomb look tame.

Because the Imperial Powers That Be wanted it that way.  They wanted a 
transponder system that could not be spoofed (at least by civilians).  
They wanted a system that could give an ironclad guarantee that the ship 
identified by the transponder was actually the ship identified by the 
transponder.  In order to bring this about, they undertook their 
painstaking development of the SDG transponder chip strain that would 
give them this ironclad guarantee.  Want more detail?  Read all about it 
in "Survival Margin."

Now, the SDG transponder suite, standard equipment on every ship built 
within the Imperium as of 1086, and required for any \'alien\' ship wanting 
to travel within Imperial boundaries, while not reprogrammable, 
alterable, or aliasable, could be turned off.  Of course, the next time 
you switched it back on, it\'d scream to high Heaven to anyone who cared 
to listen that you had done so.  In the interests of keeping an eye out 
on civilian ships and minimizing the incidence of such crimes of commerce 
as barratry and piracy, Imperial authorites required that the SDG 
transponder suite be wired directly into the ship\'s main computer which 
was, in turn, wired into everything else from the jump relay governor 
down to the electric can opener in the galley.  This allowed them to 
query a ship\'s transponder at will to check for \'irregularities.\'  Of 
course, they never did mention the true nature of these black-boxed 
\'honest brokers,\' and most people went on believing that all they did was 
send out an occasional \'squawk\' with the ship\'s name and registry code, 
rather than engaging in constant and intimate chatter with every other 
transponder suite within radio range.

To more effectively understand the SDG transponders, and their 
relationships to the Virus phenomenon, you really need to give "Survival 
Margin" another read.  I suspect that it\'s a resource that many of the 
more dogmatic and rigid Virus Debunkers(TM) have done without.

Not necessarily. The main things that need to be fixed are actually
rather simple.
1. prevent or repair errors in cell division (note that this would have
   the side effect of being a damn good treatment for radiation
   exposure!)
2. remove the limit on the number of cell divisions
3. prevent unwanted cell divisions (ie most cancers)

Note that the research required to accomplish 2 & 3 will likely either
given us regeneration or prove it\'s not possible.

The blood/brain barrier is *already* crossed by lots of drugs, and even
some prions and viruses. More to the point, it may turn out that they
have to somehow get some of the anagathics *past* the barrier because
they won\'t go *through* it. That makes that part of the treatment
rather non-trivial!

There\'s a fourth alternative, and it dates back to Jonathan Swift and
"Gulliver\'s Travels". Read up on the Struldbrugs. They were immortal.
So to avoid the problems that go with people living forever, their
society forbade them to own property or run businesses. 

While the background we have doesn\'t support such a policy, it doesn\'t
absolutely forbid it either. Make anagathics either illegal or make the
result of being known to use them (I\'m sure simple tests could detect
them) not being allowed to own "real property" (including things like
ships), or accumulate more than a limited amount of money.

The "crud" is either the right chemicals in the wrong place or
chemicals that *shouldn\'t* be there but build up over the years because
the body doesn\'t get rid of them (I\'ve read that the later actually
*is* one of the mechanisms of aging!). So the machine can tell the
difference. 

A similar method is the nanotech method. Little nanomachines (or
tailored virii, bacteria, etc) swarming around your body. They\'ll have
a record of your DNA, and anytime they find something that doesn\'t fit
they\'ll either patch it or destroy it. 

This one is interesting in that it has a real, but reasonable
disadvantage. First, it makes organ transplants a no-no. It also makes
whole blood transfusion a lot less effective (the white cells *will* be
destroyed as quickly as possible, the red cells don\'t have DNA, so they
may be allowed to hang around a fair while).

And the energy used by the nanomachines or critters has to come from
you, so you need more food.  In low food conditions, they may have to
partially or fully shut down.

It\'s also possible to get the equivalent of an auto-immune disease if
the template they work from gets corrupted. That may be why you need
periodic "refreshers". And why skipping them is not a good idea.

No you won\'t. Not if they are "cloning" (actually the proper term would
be "culturing") replacements from your own tissues. The gene defects
would still be there. And in the case of some (like sickle cell) it\'s
not even a matter of "cumulative damage". It\'s that something is being
produced improperly and it gums up the works.

I could be wrong, but I don\'t believe that any of the platinum group
metals have "ores" in the sense being chemical bound with some other
element. I\'m *real* sure about platinum, iridium and osmium.

Or ask to look at their character and equipment sheets during the game,

I once *seriously* considered buying a wastebasket size paper-shredder
that was on sale *just* to be able to do this:

Hmm. I dunno about "omnesium", but there has been (or at least *was*)
some speculation that metallic hydrogen, once formed would be stable
under normal conditions (much like diamond). It was also thought that
it\'d probably be a room temp superconductor. Estimated density was only
1/10th gram per cc though.

More than some percentage damaged, or certain types of damage should
render the reactor inoperable until they can get to a shipyard equipped
to handle fission reactors.

It\'s a great power source as long as you don\'t break it. :-)

Another one that just occured to me. The most practical bulk moderator
for a reactor that has to be operated in conditions ranging from
several g to free fall is gonna be graphite. It\'s relatively cheap,
strong enough to not need special supports (though not strong enough to
use for any load bearing purposes). It resists high temps, etc, etc.

You *can\'t* use liquids in a reactor like this. At least not outside of
carefully designed piping. So it\'ll not resemble US reactors *or* the
common Canadian CANDU heavy water reactors. Free fall and the
possibility of accelerations at odd angles just won\'t allow all that
water (or any other fluid).

That means it\'s going to look more like Russian reactors.

So, what\'s the biggest risk if something goes wrong? *Fire*! If the
reactor overheats, the graphite will burn. Just like in Chernobyl. So
will the fuel if the fire gets to it.

Sure, you\'d keep oxygen away from the reactor. But if the ship is
damaged, you can\'t guarantee that.

True. But we *are* talking about battle damage here. That makes a
difference. Fusion (at least any scale that\'ll fit into a ship) stops
if you break the reactor. Fission keeps going until you get the control
rods in, and can continue even then if things are messed up enough.

It won\'t go "boom". It isn\'t going meltdown in the "normal" way,
because as I noted in another message only an idiot would use a "pool
of liquid" as the moderator in a spaceborne reactor. 

So, it\'s possible that the reactor could do a thermal runaway. Not too
big a problem, you cut thrust and if you can\'t get the control rods
working, it just melts into a spherical mass of crud in the middle of
the confinement (ain\'t free fall wonderful).

If the thing catches fire (given that graphite is a likely moderator)
you vent the area to space. Then you get the cause of the fire under
control. 

If it gets busted into chunks that stay in the ship, then you have a
messy radiation hazard. 

I think those pretty much cover the possibilities. 

One fact worth noting is that if any of these happen the odds are good
that you can\'t repair it yourself. If it was a fire and controlled
quickly, then you make be able to fix it, depending on how much spare
graphite you have.

If presented as above, I don\'t think anybody knowledgable would have
much to complain about. And you might actually get across to a few
players that reactors are pretty safe.

Hehehe.  :)   Players are a suspicious, paranoid lot.  And it\'s a proven 
fact that they have no need to be.  The chance of any given player 
getting into a dangerous situation is so small as to be of no consequence.

Now, Player Characters on the other hand . . . :)

Thanks, John.  Here\'s the complete rule, which I just finished writing:


____________________________________________________________________________
                         Aging in Traveller

Introduction

In the Far Future, it is reasonable to believe the average lifespan will 
be greater than it is now.  I believe the Traveller aging table does not 
do a sufficient job of taking this into account.  While that table 
is very playable (in that it is one of the factors keeping players from 
making characters with unreasonable skill levels), it is not very 
realistic.  On the other hand, there are those who will feel the 
increased average lifespan that the table presented here allows is 
unrealistic.  So, use whichever system you feel most comfortable with.  
At least you have a choice now. :)

The Aging Table presented here was developed based on a conversation I 
had with John Snead and Andrew Boulton.  During the conversation, it 
was noted that using this table will allow players to generate 20-term 
characters who still have 100 years left in which to adventure.  If that 
is not your goal as referee, then the use of survival throws and/or 
referee intervention ("Look, guys, I don\'t want you to make a character 
that has spent more than X terms in their prior service.") will be 
required.  Personally, I prefer the survival throw/reenlistment throw 
alternative. As always, use what works for you.


About the Aging Table

In creating this new method of determining the effects of aging, I 
found that the use of a six-term interval gave the best results.  During 
each interval, the effects of aging remain the same.  That is, each 
interval has its own aging throw, based on the age of the individual in 
question and the tech level relevant to his situation.  Each subsequent 
interval will increase the probability of deterioration due to aging.
In addition, living at a lower technology level will result in more 
serious aging effects than if one lives at a higher technology level.

While the aging table shows intervals, it is still necessary to make the 
roll once per four-year period, just as in the Traveller rules.  
Beginning at age 34, and each four years thereafter, this table should be 
consulted.  


Using the Aging Table

Step 1: Determine the term\'s Common Tech Level (CTL).
Based on what the character has been doing for the last four years, 
the referee must decide what tech level of medical services have been 
available to the character.  For instance, an merchant engaged in trade 
between TL-15, Starport A worlds would have a CTL of 15.  A character 
exploring a TL 10 world without having access to medical services of a 
higher tech level would have a CTL of 10.  
Due to the nature of the Traveller game, it will likely come to pass that 
characters will have had experience with a variety of TLs during the term 
just passed.  If that is the case, the referee should use one of the 
averaging methods, such as determining the mean average based on the amount of 
time spent at each tech level, or simply using the tech level most 
frequently encountered by the players.  

Step 2:  Using the Aging Table below, cross-reference the character\'s CTL 
with his or her age.  This will give the saving throw required to avoid 
the effects of increasing age.  Make note of any DM\'s that may be 
received based on the character\'s social standing.

Step 3:  The player must roll the saving throw or greater on 2D for each 
characteristic affected.  During the first two intervals (12 terms), it 
is necessary to roll for a possible loss of: Strength, Dexterity (or 
Agility), and Constitution.  Each interval thereafter, an additional roll 
(for Intelligence) must be made. Each roll is for a possible 1 point 
loss to the characteristic in question. 

Example:  Clocker, a 62-year-old ex-Marine with a UPP of B75879, has spent 
the last four years of his life thusly:  1 year on a mercenary ticket on 
a TL-12 world with TL-13 medical facilities provided to his team by the 
patron (meaning TL-13 is the relevant tech level for this year); 1 year 
on a mercenary ticket on a TL-8 world with TL-13 medical facilities 
provided by the patron (again, TL-13 for this year); 1 year stranded on 
that TL-8 world, left MIA, with only TL-8 facilities available; 1 year 
on a TL-15 world getting some well-deserved R&R.  
The referee rules that the CTL is 13. (The referee may have ruled that 
TL-8 was the most relevant, however, if a major medical emergency had 
occurred during the year Clocker was stranded.  Or, he may have ruled 
that the relevant TL was 12, because the mean average is 12.25.  A 
variety of rulings are possible, and it is completely up to the referee 
how the CTL is determined.  However it is determined, it is necessary 
that the referee be consistent in the method used from term-to-term and 
character-to-character.) 
Clocker\'s age is then cross-referenced with the CTL, yielding a result 
of 5+ (Interval 2, TL 12-13).  The player rolls 2D for each of Strength, 
Dexterity, and Constitution (since the character is in interval 2, a roll 
for Intelligence loss is not necessary).  The die rolls are: 4, 5, 7.  He 
lost one point of Strength, but did not lose Dexterity or Constitution.  
Thus, his new UPP is A75879.

Oh I agree with you totally.  There\'s no way any of these people would 
want to be connected in anyway with the policies of any of the Imperial 
factions.  But if you look at Dulinor\'s ideals, representation, and 
getting involved in the internal polocies of every planet for the benefit 
of all imperial citizens.  This all came to pass.  Though no one would 
admit the idea\'s came from Dulinor.  They\'d probably blame the whole 
thing on the Greeks or some such thing.

Oh, I think that if the Regency could prove to the RC that they were a 
new pregressive type of government, with a figurehead monarchy.  A 
government, "of the people, by the people, for the people" (I\'ve always 
loved that line in your constitution) they\'d have no problem with the RC. 
 The problem is they\'ve got to convince them it is so.

Which means once it had taken over one Vargr, Alsan Clan X?, Hiver, 
Solomani or Kkree ship.  It could take over any other race X ship like it 
 was an imperial vessel.  It\'s like the super cockroach theory, if DDT

I think that perhaps the largest problem with discussing Virus is 
realizing that when virus transmit\'s it\'s code, it\'s not computer code 
we\'re talking about.  It is, for lack of a better term, silicon genetic 
code that allows it to parasitize the chips on the other starship.  The 
more of that code the other starship recieves, the faster the Virus 
develops.

We must remember that the Cymbline Chip, as described in Signal GK, has 
the ability to carve it\'s circutry patterns on another chip at a distance 
by manipulating the electromagnetic forces around it.  As long as it has 
power it will continue to carve new circuts and develop/

Ahh Crap!!  The headless corpse drags itself into Marvin the Martian\'s

I\'ve always loved that device.  Marvin the Martian sits atop my monitor 
as stares at me as I write all my letters.  Which explains a lot your 
letters would be pretty strange too if you had to write them while 
someone else was staring at you.

They just seem to attract it.  I played a GURP\'s campaign once which had

        That\'s EXACTLY why the Imperium required the transponder to have
tamperproof access to the rest of the ship ... so dirty, evil, rotten
Zhodani sympathizers like you couldn\'t get away with your heinous crimes.

        Note that tamperproof doesn\'t mean you couldn\'t tamper with it, just
that the transponder would detect that its connections had been altered.
You\'ve got a miniscule chance of successfully doing it, but if you fail the
Imperium\'s probably gonna hammer you first chance they get, because the Deyo
chip will squeal like a pig on you.

You won\'t need the control rods if you have a negative thermal
coefficient pellet-bed reactor.  A friend of mine is working on these at
lanl for space power applications.  The fuel is encased in tiny ceramic
pellets that are doped with neutron moderators.  The neutron cross
section of the pellet walls goes up with temp, so the reactor can\'t go
above the limiting temp where the shell stops enough of the neutrons.
These things really work, pretty cool.  They\'re not quite as good at 
making power though since they run at lower temps.

Good point.  I\'ll have to email David Golden and Guy Garnett and try to 
work with them on developing new rules, skills, equipment, and programs that 
will fill this gaping void in the rules.  Hopefully, we\'ll be able to get 
something reasonable out within the next ten days or so.

section.  I /love/ the Fatigue and Upkeep rules.  They really did a 
thorough job on this stuff.

Here\'s a paragraph from this section:

"The game referee should not bother about minor sleep period deficiencies 
except in instances where fatigue and endurance can both clearly become 
important to a group\'s activities.  That is, if a group is moving at a 
fairly leisurely pace with plenty of time to catch up on sleep and rest, 
an interrupted night\'s sleep period is of no great concern, and should 
not be allowed to slow up the game by causing a flurry of paperwork and 
calculations on the part of either the referee or the players." [TNE, p 
199, column 2, paragraph 7.]

Excellent.

I\'d expand that and include it in a general section of the book:

"The game referee should not bother about minor effects of game rules.  
In an attempt to provide rules for as many situations as possible, this book 
contains hundreds of different rules which, if all were used all the 
time, would result in a flurry of paperwork and calculations on the part 
of the referee and players, slowing up the game.  Unless it is important 
to the plot, the referee is encouraged to ignore any specific rule or 
group of rules s/he wishes."

I know they included something like that in the referee section, but I 
like the way this is stated.  Don\'t just ignore the rules you don\'t like 
or which don\'t fit into your campaign.  Ignore the rules that are 
bothersome and pointless in terms of furthering the plot.

I can just see some of the old D&Ders I used to know in junior high, with 
a copy of TNE:

Referee:  "You\'re surrounded by vicious Wombats.  What do you do?"
Fred (PC): "So I pull out my assault rifle and begin firing at them."
Referee:  "So you try to pull out your assault rifle, but you\'re too tired."
Fred: "What?!?!"
Referee:  "Well, you haven\'t told me your character has been eating every 
day.  So, your character is starving.  And you never mentioned going to 
sleep, so you\'re dead tired, too.  Sorry, it\'s in the rules."

Actually, although Gibson and Stirling\'s SF novel based on this premise
was called "The Difference Engine," Babbage and Lovelace\'s fully
programmable design was called the "Analytical Engine."  The DE was a
specialized unit for calculating tables of numeric values using Nth-order
differences -- hence the name.  I think the authors chose this title for
the pun -- "See what a difference this would have made." 

The AE was a fully general computer in the modern sense.  Interestingly,
it used separate program and data stores (so Virus couldn\'t eat it... ;)). 
Babbage did the hardware side, pushing the envelope of early Victorian 
mechanical engineering to reach the fine tolerances needed to make the 
thing work.  The machinists he trained, though incapable of meeting the 
demands of the AE, took the techniques developed for Babbage and applied 
them to many other projects, accelerating the Industrial Revolution.

Lady Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron\'s daughter, handled the software side of 
the project.  She single-handedly invented many of the modern concepts of 
computer programming in a series of essays in which she explained how the 
AE would be used.  She also set an important precedent for software 
engineering practice by developing software for an architecture which (a) 
kept changing on a weekly basis, and (b) wasn\'t actually operational 
until about 70 years after her death. :)

By the way, the programming language Ada is named in her honor.  A 
fitting tribute, in my view.

We know the language of the Second Imperium was Anglic, the ancestor of
the Third Imperium\'s Galactic Anglic => Anglic.  Since the Third Imperium
based itself solidly on descent from the Second, it\'s likely that the
Sylean Federation used (Gal)Anglic as well.  So my guess would be that,
yes, the explorers could read the signs and labels, assuming that they
don\'t pertain to knowledge that was lost and then independently rediscovered 
(thus producing new technical terminology) or varied cultural assumptions.

Of course, if the Second-Imperium-era base was founded by one of the ethnic
enclaves that spread out from Earth throughout the Rule of Man, then all
bets are off.  The base indicators might well be in Arabic, or Swahili,
or, hell, Australian Aborigine....

"Imperial" doesn\'t work, else what did they call it during the era of the
Sylean Federation?  "Sylean" is the independently-developed common language
of the Sylean human minor race.  I think we want to avoid D&D-esque variants
of "Common" and such... ditto for Harrison-like advocacy of Esperanto.  What
would we call, say, a simplified version of English, something like the Basic
English that Voice of America used for broadcasts?  Heck, perhaps "Basic"
would be a good name, later changed to "Galactic Basic"?  Though that would
tend to abbreviate to "Galbase", which sounds even more fungal to me....

_Survival Margin_ Quotes on Virus.

1. - "The Cymbeline chips reproduce by impressing their circuitry patterns
         onto existing silicon chips,"

2. - "In 1086, the researchers acheived their goal: the creation of a
         strain of chip -- the SDG-313F series"

3. - "The new SDG-313F transponder system consisted of ... two SDG-313F
         chips."

4. - "Most people are not aware that transponder systems are constantly 
         broadcasting and receiving information"

5. - "In conversing, the chips interactively exchange information from
         their dedicated memory chips, and from their own ship\'s main
         computer core and databanks, to which the transponders have
         unimpeded access."

6. - "...in 1088, the new transponders became mandatory equipment on
         all spacecraft operating within the Imperial boundaries."

7. - "The SDG circuits were also exported vigorously, ....  Many
         governments ... adapted the system for themselves rather than
         carrying two seperate IFF systems."

8. - "By 1116, the Deyo[SDG] Circuit was ubiquitous within the Imperium
         and along its frontiers, and was well-represented even at the
         core of K\'kree and Hiver space."

9. - "...main strengths of the virus ... ability to cut new circuitry,
         i.e., embed itself in hardware, not just software. [Paragraph]
         Upon entering a new system, the first thing that the virus
         would do is ... cut its code into the computer\'s own circuitry."

10.- "While a virus-infected ship could also easily insert its code
         into other ships by routine computer-controlled communications,
         it was often more convenient to infect them by using the
         constant transponder chatter."

11.- "This also gave the virus a familiar, easily entered location in an
         alien electronics suite in which to \'gestate\' while solving the
         riddle of an unfamiliar system."

12.- "One means of infection that was feared by the uninfected was via
         their sensors.  ...this never happened.  ...Any such attempt
         ... would take a very long time indeed."

13.- "...there would always be the computer system that was inaccessible
         to any methon of infection.  In these cases, the virus\' credo
         was ... :\'If I can\'t have it, no one can.\'"


I\'m interested to hear what the computer specialists among us have to say
about the "facts" listed above from _Survival Margin_.  As I said above, my
intent here is not to add fuel to a flame war, only to understand what
others are thinking.  If you don\'t think you can answer me to the list
without getting flamed, please respond to me in private, but PLEASE RESPOND.
Obviously, I couldn\'t quote the entire book above, but I think I\'ve chosen
the best parts to convey the idea behind Virus.  I\'m very interested in
responces.

Wrong... The chips were self mobile, and bred by imprinting their patterns
on a piece of silicon they had come into contact with; they also had
evolved "built in" photocells for power, and had limited magneto-gravitic
mobility. No remotely about it. According to _Signal GK_, they had
developed some radio comm abilities to share "huge" finds of raw materials,
and threat data. Niche: Hunter/Gatherer, as they could also prey upon the
simpler forms of silicate life  in their environment. Note that predation
amongst cymbeline\'s assorted species of chips was limited to reproductive
needs only, as they were all photocell equipped.

of all the models for virus operation, leonards works.... it allows the
virus to "do what it does", in a logical, timely manner, but also adheres
to cannon on they "deyo"/SDG chips (SDG being the lettering that they have
carried from their chance encounter with a solomani chip labeled SDG
something or other...).

Head shots are too much of a bitch.  The head moves too much to be a
reliable target.  Aim center-mass.  A hit to the center chest with a 7.62mm,
11.4g bullet moving at 792 m/s will ruin your day.  Kevlar below level IIC
will not stop it.

Sorry, but after trying to follow all the computer language and physics

terminology into the mix.

Let\'s try again.

For transporting a high passenger the ship owner is paid (by the passenger)
10,000cr.
For transporting a mid passenger the ship owner is paid (by the passenger)
8,000cr.
In both cases the \'overhead\' listed in CT for either passenger is 2,000cr.
Net income for a high passenger will 8,000cr (less a little more for
stewards pay).
Net income for a mid passenger will be 6,000cr (no steward for mid passengers).

It is out of the \'overhead\' of 2,000cr that taxes and supplies are paid.
Net profits 
remains the same.

Platinum is seldom found in a pure state, and platinum production produces
another metalic substance as a by product: Palladium (sp?). Palladium is a
rose colored silveresque metal very similar to platinum in characteristics.

>From Perry\'s:

Palladium separates out in the process for separating platinum from it\'s
matrix materials. While less desired than platinum, it is also much more
rare, and thus has similar market values.

        No, right ... Survival Margin, p71 says the original weapon was
developed based "... on a newly discovered \'wild strain\' of Cymbeline chip.
These symbiotic parasites were, in some cases, able to change the circuitry
of theur prey at long distance ..." And again, p79, "...which could command
prey chips to cut new circuitry without having to come into physical contact

        That\'s the ancestry of Virus. Therefore my comment about "no
physical connection needed" remains mostly correct. The true Deyo
transponder chips couldn\'t prey on other chips remotely. HOWEVER, Virus
derived from a chip which could and did prey remotely on other chips (such
as the Deyo\'s ancestors).

        Personal opinion, here... BL is a pain in the neck to set up unless
you use pregenerated ship control panels (conveniently available from my web
site <G>), while BR is designed for LARGE ships ... as in 30,000T Battle
Riders. I think we need to create our own game which is a decent blend of
BLs role-playing detail (players really do care where their ship gets hit)
with BRs speed.

 to iron (Fe 56) the *less* energy you can get from a given mass of

 nucleons in the mass, divide by 56. Then multiply the result by the
 mass of a Fe 56 atom. The difference between the starting and ending
 figure is the mass that can be converted into energy.

Not really... The semiempirical mass formula which roughly gives the binding
energy of nuclei as a function of neutron and proton number looks like

E = -14 A + 18.1 (N-Z)^2/A + 0.56 Z^2 / A^(1/3) + 13.1 A^(2/3)

N is # of neutrons, Z is # of protons, A=N+Z
Binding energy PER NUCLEON is peaked at Iron 56, but total binding energy keeps
going up with heavier nuclei.

 However, you made one slight goof. it\'s unlikely that the nuclei will
 *fission*. Fisssion is an uncomon decay mode. Instead, you are likely
 to get a lot of alpha and beta decay chains. Thus, getting the amiount
 of energy from the calculation in the previous paragraph is difficult,
 if not impossible.

You have a nuclear damper.  You can make the things as unstable as you want,
and give them any decay mode you want.  You want fission or alpha decay, turn
down the strong force.  You want beta decay, turn up the weak force.

 Actually, the best way is to take some transuranic elements and
 stabilize them with the damper field. A good choice would be
 Californium 254. This is a fissionable element with a critical mass of
 less than an *ounce*! Picture the results when the missile impacts,
 destroying the damper, and leaving several hundred *kilos* of it
 sitting there. :-)

What happens if you have a power failure?  My way is a lot safer, and if we are
manipuilating nuclear forces, we can make any critical mass we want.

 Neutralize the weak force to the point that free neutrons won\'t decay.
 Feed neutrons into the field. With a little help from gravatics, you
 should be able to get a fairly dense "neutron gas", possibly even a
 liquid. I don\'t think even TL 15 is up to creating neutronium. In any
 case, when you drop the field on *this* the results should be
 gratifying, especially if you *reverse* the field just as you implode
 the contents.

 I figure the result would be *all* the neutrons converting to an
 electron, proton, and anti-neutrino. The densely packed hydrogen
 *can\'t* fuse until the damper field drops. If things are set up right,
 that\'ll happen at maximum density, and the result ought to make a
 regular hydrogen bomb look tame.

The limiting factor in the hydrongen buring is the first interaction, 

proton + proton --> deuteron + positron + neutrino 

Turn up the weak force and dont worry too much about density.  The reaction
rate at the center of the sun is pretty low, and there the hydrogen density is
like water.

PCs are more for BL, but it takes a long time to play.  Down to

With each other they are with some fixes (which I\'ve already done).  To

If you want a "there\'s a 2cm hole in stateroom three.  Fix it!" level of
detail, try BL.  BR only deals with critical hits.

I hope that the following is consistent with the position I\'ve taken in the
past on this subject.  I don\'t think that any of it is canon.

Imperial citizenship is defined by Imperial law, which recognizes three
sources of Imperial citizenship:  birthplace, parentage, and naturalization.  

Specifically, Imperial law decrees that Imperial citizens are:  
(1) every living sentient being that came into existence (a) on or within
the star system of a member state of the Imperium or (b) aboard a starship
in jump space (i) between two member states of the Imperium or (ii) between
a member state and a non-Imperial destination, but on the ship\'s clock
closer in time to the member state; 
(2) every living sentient being born to at least one Imperial citizen; and
(3) every living sentient being who has completed the requirements for
naturalization and has received certification as an Imperial citizen by an
Imperial Judicial Court or Imperial noble of the rank of Duke or higher who
holds an appropriate commission.

Citizens of the Imperium have certain rights in the Imperium (not many),
but, outside the Imperium are entitled to the full protections afforded by
treaties between the Imperium and other interstellar governments.  (Remember
the Don Pacifico affair for the importance of such rights, or Woodrow
Wilson\'s shelling of Veracruz.)  

Imperial citizenship does not conflict with citizenship in an Imperial
member state; indeed, the norm is to have two citizenships, Imperial and
local.  For example, Eneri Gonzalez was born on Efate/Regina/Spinward
Marches.  He is an Imperial citizen by birth. The law of Efate provides that
someone born on Efate to an Imperial citizen is a citizen of Efate.  Eneri
is thus also a citizen of Efate, subject to Efate taxes, military
conscription, education, etc.  

Prienjistebr was also born on Efate, but his parents were Zhodani citizens.
Under Imperial law, he is an Imperial citizen.  Under Zhodani law, which
also looks to parentage and birthplace, he is a Zhodani citizenship.  Under
Imperial law, he may retain dual citizenship until age 18, when he must
choose.  If he chooses Zhodani citizenship, he will have to get appropriate
Zhodani travel documents (specifically a passport) and an Imperial resident
visa.  Zhodani law also permits dual citizenship, and requires that the
choice be made at approximately the same age.  (A treaty between the
Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate has clarified any confusion on the age at
which dual citizenship ends.)

As to Efate, however, Prienjistebr faces a different situation.  Efate law
provides that someone born on Efate to an Imperial citizen is a citizen of
Efate, so Prienjistebr is not a citizen of Efate.  

An immigration law that shouldn\'t be confused with citizenship (which is a
bundle of rights) is that of travel documents, such as passports, visas, and
work permits.  Eneri Gonzalez obtains a passport at age 18 from the
government of Efate, which is really valid only for travel within the
Imperium.  He must present it at customs when he arrives at Louzy, but he
won\'t be allowed to board the long jump liner for Farreach if that\'s the
only passport he has.  In order to leave the Imperium legitimately, he must
have an Imperial passport, for which he must apply separately from the Efate
passport.  Nevertheless, the two passports are commonly integrated into a
single document with both the Imperial and Efate seals and appropriate
signatures.

Intra-Imperial travel does not present too many barriers.  Most member
states don\'t require visas of citizens of other member states who intend to
visit for limited times, but there are exceptions (rich worlds typically
restrict immigration, as do worlds dependent on artificial life support
systems).  These exceptions include, for example, limiting the time of stay;
requiring the expenditure of a certain number of credits per diem while in
the member state; requiring quarantine; and prohibiting entry entirely.

I hope that these are useful comments.

That\'s a completely wrong-headed approach.  FO should be made a cascade
skill, which would cascade into: rock targetting, deadfall ortillery
targeting, energy weapon ortillery targeting (which excludes meson weapons),
meson targetting, tac missile targeting, and artillery targeting.  Virus

Ya\'ll aren\'t understanding my plaintive "WHY?"  It\'s not why did 3I

to spoof.  I wanted a free and loose game, not one where the "powers"

So, I suppose you just went along with that, huh?  ;-> 

I encouraged my paranoid and sneaky players.  I made it a Difficult
task to "tamper with the transponder", but the difficult is very
doable with good skills.  Avoiding discovery was Routine...unless the
authorities actually took the ship apart.

The PC\'s were perfectly legit merchant-traders too, but they had
several different *seemingly* official transponder codes.  They picked
them up from the same sort of NPC\'s that provided them with the most
*interesting* jobs.  :->

    'body' => 'Musashi posts a looong post:
Concerning the Solomani in in the TNE, here are some deveopment notes from
my Mega-Traveller and TNE campaigns:  

 My Mega-Traveller campaign had an alternate ending to the Civil War, one in
which the Solomani get their act together after a revolution within the
government of the Solomani Movement. Joshua Davin (he\'s not dead) and the
Reformists have precipitated a coup against those nasty SolSec people,
destroying much of the command and control of the Solomani Movement. With
help of a variety of attack viruses (small "v") developed by the living
computer chips rescued from Cymbeline,  the coup was successful in its
commando attacks on the security and military leadership on both Terra and
Home. However, the assets of the Solomani military and security forces
quickly recovered and hunkered down in a protracted war with the liberators,
which hold Home and Terra.Yet, the common man (and  sophont) joined with the
New Patriots (Dahvin et al) in a widespread revolt against the fascist
Solomani Tyranny. The new movement and government has a name and a mission
that is extrordinary for the 5th Millenium AD, a revolutionary one, that
would appeal to the real Strephon. The Republic of the Milky Way seeks to
destroy and replace the ideal that destroyed both the Imperium and the
Solomani. The Custom of Superiority, whether it is based on social standing
or racial dogma, sacrificed the beings of the Imperium to a massive war that
could not be won, and destroyed the freedom of all sophonts in the Solomani
Sphere. The denizens of the Sphere, not unlike those in the Imperium, were
sacrificed not in the name of security or prosperity, but petty conquest and
the personal agrandizment of their so-called leaders.   The New Patriots are
still fighting the strong remanants of the Solomani Tyranny, but are
begining to set their sights on liberating the citizens of the former
Imperium before another very Long Night sets down on charted space. I am, of
course, still developing (and refereeing) this campaign as it continues into
the tulmutuous 1130\'s.  This background,  however,  led directly to my New
Era campaign.
  When VIRUS  hit the rimward states, one of the few governments
unintentionally ready to deal with the threat, was that of the New Patriots
of the Republic of the Milky Way, deep in the Solomani Sphere. VIRUS
devastated the elements and worlds of the Solomani Tyranny, including their
puppet states and coerced allies. The New Patriots had a defense waiting for
VIRUS. The living chips of Cymbeline, smuggled off their home planet by the
pansophists, became willing members and citizens of the Republic. By the
time Virus made it to the core of the Sphere, most ships, installations, and
other computer equiped systems were inhabited by Cymbeline Citizens (CCs as
they refer to the themselves). The CCs were quite different from the systems
that made up VIRUS in that they needed fairly sophisticated computer system
support to evolve and participate with non-silicon sophonts. They could not
invade computers like VIRUS. That was an ability developed later. CC\'s had
to be voluntarilly installed as resident AI CPU\'s controlling entirely new
systems or be retrofitted into an existing one, an exacting, complex
procedure, that would become obsolete when the CC\'s became the dominant form
of symbiotic CPU\'s in all advanced systems. The CC\'s are naturally evolved
silicon lifeforms, never the less. Their complexity and intelligence
exceeded all but the most highly evolved VIRUS strains,  just as any human
would be infinitely more complex than any pre-Virus Tech Level 16 or 17
psuedobiological android. VIRUS would never be able to catch up with the
CC\'s billion of  years evolution and the resulting explosion of intelligence
that took place when they became exposed the universe outside their now
irradiated homeworld, Cymbeline. The CC\'s became the last line of defense
against VIRUS. Younger CC\'s succumbed to only the most highly advanced VIRUS
strains and that was only one of the weak links in the Republic\'s defense.
Now VIRUS had the remaining military craft of the Solomani Tyranny and those
of the surrounding former Imperium. Some of the bastions of the Tyranny that
survived the assault of VIRUS, made quisling deals with the enemy, adding
their might and treachery to the onslaught. Only through sheer, brute
physical force was Virus able to push the Republic\'s sphere of 120+ systems
down to a small core of 35 systems, 22 possessing  habitable worlds. All
this destruction and genocide since IT was unleashed upon the Rim. In the
1170\'s , the CC\'s began developing the ability to fight Virus with ITs own
methods. Using a method called Gemini, the CCs evolved the ability to send
out powerful almost identical forms (Twins or Avatars) of themselves, that
were technically viruses like VIRUS, but self-aware in a way VIRUS can never
be.  Although it has been debated by theologians and philosophers to a
standstill in the Republic, there is a fact, so very important,  that not
even Yaskodray (Grandfather) would never know:  VIRUS,  no matter how
self-aware or conscious it may appear to be, does not have a SOUL! That is
the advantage Cybeline Citizens and their Gemini Twins posess and that is
the means the Republic will use to take back the Milky Way from the
literally souless VIRUS. The war against VIRUS became:  The CRUSADE. The
living community of CC\'s, humaniti, and other sophonts assumed an almost
Holy Obligation to destroy VIRUS. They know VIRUS, in their hearts,
theoretically, has no soul, never will, and with the few exceptions (maybe)
within the "God is Good" strain, deserves absolute extermination. Only then
will all beings be truly free. That is how the New Era has dawned in the old
Solomani Rim. Thus endeth just a part of my ramblings.

Speaking as someone from the deeeep south, you\'all <g>, who has taught
native Scots, Irish, Welsh, and speakers of various English dialects I
*do* understand your point.  However, as long as we speak slowly, and
avoid colloquial and slang expressions we understand each other quite
well.  OTOH, it is *very* hard to understand folks who learn english
as a second language after reaching adulthood...partly because of
differences in pace and rhythms, partly because some sounds in english
aren\'t natural for them.

My guess is that in 0, Galanglic (a very respectable and old SF term,
BTW) will be similar to either Latin in medieval europe, or
trade-pidgin.  In the first case, most cultures would have people who
could talk to visitors..but these might be specialized professionals. 
In the second case, there would be huge
differences in local usage, but a small essential sub-set of the
language would be commonly understandable.

The *fixed cost* for LIFE SUPPORT is 2,000cr per trip for every
stateroom.  Other costs the owner has to cover include fuel, salaries,
maintenance, berthing costs and mortgage.  
(p. 5-7 CT BK2)

The *price* the ship\'s owner charges to transport a passenger can be
some other number..like the 10,000cr price quoted in CT.  (p. 2 CT
BK2)

I can\'t say I\'m enamored with the price fixing, "Passengers will pay
the standard fare for the class of transportation they choose:  CR
10,000 for high....", (p 8 CT BK 2), "Cargo is normally shipped at a
rate of CR 1000 per ton.", (p 7 CT BK 2). I\'m much more given to
letting the market dictate prices.

Nice try, but not remotely true.  SDG comes from (originally) the tests run
on the Cymbeline chips and their offspring - Strain D Group (in this case
313F).  Later, one of the researchers hooked up one of the chips of this
Group to a big data library, and it told the researcher (through a voder)
that it thought that SDG stood for Soli Deo Gloria ("To God alone goes the
glory").  Apparently the chip had found a Bach entry in the data library!

Deyo came from someone writing Deo down improperly and it stuck.

Incidentally, the researcher asked another chip what Deo meant to it, and it
replied, "Daylight come and me wan\' go home."

And now you know the rest of the story.

I never bothered with changing the prices until I became enamored of 
economics in college.  My players had the dubious honor of benefitting 
from my college education, you see. :)  Every time I learned something 
new that could be applied to the game, it was.  It helped me a LOT on 
tests (\'cuz I\'d been using the knowledge), but drove the players bonkers 
at times.  :)  

It was MUCH more fun letting macro- and microeconomic factors determine 
pricing and availability.  For me, anyway. :)

"Doh!"

So I might need both!  I like the idea of a single, combined system that
makes use of the strengths of the two systems much better 8-)

BL sounds a bit too complicated for my group\'s style of gaming, although I
can see why the complexity might be necessary when it is the PC\'s ship we
are talking about.  As for BR, I never ran the type of campaign where
players and/or characters would have control of such massive vessels.
Since large-scale fleet engagements usually have lasting effects on a
campaign\'s background, I prefer to have a little more control over these
events that allow me and my players to firght that battle (but that\'s just
me).

Just out of curiosity, what are the Jump, MDrive, armour, weapons
capabilities, etc. of these large ships in BR/TNE?  High Guard allowed me
to design everything from 100t scouts up to a 1,000,000 rift tanker but I
never had enough information to decide things like "what is the average
armour value on a destroyer or cruiser or battle rider (in relation to each
other)" or "how many redundant systems will an escort have vs. a
dreadnaught."

My own home-brewed rules (based on the aforementioned HG) would probably
work, although I really would have to wait for the T4 Basic Rules and
Starships books to be released before hand.

I think everyone need a little extra nap time tomorrow!  We must be the

    'body' => 'I was working on a small craft in SSDS, but I was wondering if SSDS will
include the Electronics tables to build custom suites for small craft.  In
a fighter, I want Fib computers, but I don\'t necessarily need a Military
Suite.  Just wondering.  Anyway, I designed a 20 ton Sylean Fighter, but
it needs 165Mw of power, 106 from the Electronics suite alone!  The end
result is about 100MW of power plant taking up 50m^3, and the design is
overspace by 38m^3.  It would also bring the cost under 74MCr.

I have a few other questions:
1. What is the benefit of ROF 100 over ROF 10 in combat terms?
2. What have people been using as armour values on MilSpec ships
3. How many weapons are going to be allowed on a ship, esp small craft
(e.g) can a fighter mount external missiles and a laser socket.


Sylean TL-12 Fighter Craft (Interdictor)
Tons 20 Wedge (AF)		Vol 280m^3		MCr 94.146 (90%)
Crew 1 (5 Maint)			Pass 0/0			Low 0	
Cargo 0m^3			Controls TL12		TL 12
07 Size Rating			00 Jump Rating
00 Fire Control			06 G Rating Thrusters
Laser Battery 1-0-0-0		17 Power Rating
				02 Fuel Rating
				10 A   4 P  10 J (EMM) Sensor Rating
				02 Armor	04 Structure

A 20 Ton Fusion Fighter craft, the Sylean Interdictor is the smallest
front line fighter around.  With a 6G acceleration, and mounting a 96Mj
ROF 100 laser, it can hurt small ships, and in swarms can hurt even larger
ones.  It requires 5 maintenance workers to keep the fighter operational,
and has a crew of 1 (pilot), who also serves as gunner.

Barring the problems of fitting a custom sensor suite, then the design is
fairly viable.  If I can get more space internally, I would like to see
either missiles, or up the armor to 80 for a USD of 3.

Questions, comments?  Are we going to be able to fit custom suites?  If
not, then I will most likely put in a civilian suite.

One idea I have is to build the fighter much like a modern fighter.  Use
passive sensors, and then launch a larger Electronic Warfare Fighter (EWF)
(like an AWACS or Hawkeye) that will find the enemy, then direct fire for
the rest of the squadron.  This could lead to linked fire against larger
targets (i.e.) Capital Ships.  The other idea would be to use the EWF to
paint the target for missiles (depending on how missiles work).

In fact I\'ve been a "translator" in just such a situation.  
One of my cousins\' husband (from Tennessee) was in New York  
on a business trip, and stopped by where I work. It turns 
out he and one of my co-workers (from Jamaica) have a  
common interest in, shall we say, the finer points of 
the distilling of certain beverages (and I mean connesieur-level 
interest: they\'ll argue fine points about rum or whiskey 
the way this list argues about asteroid-bombs), which they took 
as sufficient excuse to \'celebrate\' after work. 
 
Thanks to the differences in pronounciation and  
speed of speech (my Jamaican friend speaks *very* fast, 
especially when he\'s excited -- or had a few), they couldn\'t 
understand each other unless they were speaking *very* 
slowly and clearly.  Since I was used to the way both 
of them spoke, I wound up "interpreting" when one wasn\'t 
too clear on what the other just said. 
 
It was rather surreal: they couldn\'t understand each other 
over half the time, but I understood both of them clearly 
(discounting for drinks consumed) and they understood  
me with no problems.

        That was my original hope and plan. Unfortunately I didn\'t get them
in, and Don indicated SSDS was pushing its space limits anyway. However, if
you either have FF&S, want to ask someone who does, or wait for a possible

You can\'t imagine the number of times I\'ve tried to read "The Difference 
Engine"  I love William Gibson, I can\'t get past the first section where 
they dump the initail characters.  I\'ve read 100 pages of this book and

I liked what\'s her face, I was enthralled with the story.  Then they 
changed characters.  I couldn\'t forgive them for that and I never 
finished the book.

Brilliant Lances is the more tactically-focussed game, while Battle Rider 
is probably your \'grand strategic simulator.\'

Both systems (unless memory fails -- not totally unlikely) use the same 
time and distance scales (30,000 km hexes, 30 minute turns).  I think 
that BR makes some passing, slight allowance for PC skills (mostly it 
works in terms of total crew quality), but Brilliant Lances makes a much 
greater allowance (PC skills can figure into almost any task roll 
required for BL).
 
> Are they fully compatible with each other and might they be compatible with

All ships in Battle Rider are actually ships designed using the Brilliant 
Lances/FF&S system, with conversions and simplifications made to 
facilitate faster play with large numbers of large ships.  The balance 
between both systems is almost equal -- in other words:  Whether you use 
one system or the other, the outcome will likely be the same.

Brilliant Lances is probably the best choice for this, especially if you 
don\'t want your PCs (and their skills) to get lost in the shuffle.  The 
caveat is that you\'re going to have to do a lot of advance preparation 
(those darn data sheets) in order to make the battles themselves run 
smoothly.  Check out David Golden\'s comments on this (his webpage has a 
whole bunch of pre-made BL data sheets).

On the other hand, if you\'re going to have large numbers of capital ships 
involved, then Battle Rider is the way to go.  I don\'t suspect that this 
will be the case, unless you\'ve got a 30,000 ton battle rider or two 
beating up on scads corsair craft, which very rarely reach such a size.

As for compatability with T4?  I\'m probably the wrong guy to ask, since 
I\'m not an IG staffer, nor have I been asked to help one.  However, since 
all T4 design systems will ultimately lead back to FF&S (or whatever its 
next evolution turns out to be) as their basis (you know:  FF&S --> SSDS 
- --> QSDS), you can expect that BL and BR should work with them.  Of 
course, IG is coming out with their own, simplified space combat system 
(as hinted at by QSDS\'s \'factors\'), and that probably won\'t be directly 
compatable with either of the previous systems (although, once again, 
they\'ll have a somewhat common basis).  Those offended by the lack of 
detail will probably stick with Brilliant Lances, and it\'s likely that IG 
may release a separate, detail-intensive starship combat system to 
satisfy these folks.  All of this is really wild-ass guessing on my part, 
with only a passing resemblance to reality, mind you...

You might be surprised. And you do have to keep in mind that regardless
of all the BS floating around, the US was *deliberately* not set up as
a democracy. Democracies have a *lousy* track record, from the Greeks
right on up to the present. (Remember, the laws against the Jews in
the Third Reich were passed *democratically*).

It\'s not clear to what extent the Nobles affect everyday life. There
are ways such a system could work as well as our current one. And given
the apathy over elections in most places, I can see folks deciding it
really doesn\'t make that much difference as long as they can influence
their *local* government.

How many folks right now care *how* their UN representative is
appointed/elected/whatever? The Imperium doesn\'t affect everyday life
*on planet* much more than the UN affects everday life in most
countries. 

That\'s the beauty of the "planetary autonomy" bit. The planet can be a
democracy, republic, dictatorship, whatever, and the Imperial
Government doesn\'t care. 

(BTW, consider folks like the Kennedys and Rockefellers. They are *not*
that far from being a "hereditary nobility"!)

Banks loan money to folks with some fair-sized ships these days, don\'t
they? The only problem I see is that the profitability of the ships
should be a bit higher. After all, the idea is that the ship *is* worth
the loan.

Ah! But in most of the rules, all we know is that you do something
called a "jump" and a week later you come out at somewhere else. That
doesn\'t do much violence to physics. As a matter of fact, it looks like
one of the major bugaboos of the anti-FTL crowd, time travel, is *damn*
difficult to pull off in this situation. (I\'ll eventually get the
requirements worked out).

Yeah but the idea of FTL isn\'t that big a deal. The details matter, but
so do the details of every game element.

And what we are trying to say is that the computer *cannot* execute
code that the *existing* code on the computer hasn\'t told it to run.
It\'s not a matter of human intervention. It\'s that the "code" that
comprises the virus may come over a comm link, just linke a file comes
over your Internet link. But unless the *existing* software on that
computer has instructions to start running the contents of the file, it
won\'t. Just like your system won\'t execute email. 

The *computer* has to make the "decision" to run the virus. And that
decision is based on whatever is running on the computer *before* the
virus gets there. If it has programming that says "files received over
this link and meeting these criteria are to be executed" then it will
do so. If not, *nothing* in files received over that link can make the
computer execute them.

Look at it this way. There is *nothing* that can make *you* read a
piece of mail, or email unless you decide to. And you are intelligent.
So why should an *un*intelligent computer be able to do so. 

If that isn\'t strong enough, then instead of mail, consider a package
that has just been delivered. I don\'t care if the contents of the
package are intelligent or not. You aren\'t going to open it unless
*you* decide to. A computer will *never* open ity, unless it has
instructions telling it to open packages (and those instructions would
constitute a "back door" in the terminology we\'ve been using).

The "Psionic Suppressions" are a historical event. And the basic thrust
was that the use of Psi was made illegal (and Psi got treated a lot
like Jews under Hitler)

Psi *shields* aren\'t really all that arguable, unless you want to claim
that Psi is "magic". If it *isn\'t* "magic", then it has to follow
rules, and those rules are part of the laws of physics. So, it follows
that there ought to be able to be a way to produce devices that use
those rules. And it is usually *much* easier to disrupt an effect than
to create it.

The "basic principles" of a gun are that it propels a projectile at great
speed. Thus, everything from the "hand cannon" thru the steam cannon
(yes, they actually built such things) on up to rail-guns still use the
same "basic principles". If they used other principles, they wouldn\'t
be a gun. If you want to get picky you can narrow it by requiring that
the propulsion be by means of expanding gases in a closed tube. That
excludes railguns (and catapults), but includes *everything* that the
average person would call a gun.

The basic principles of a computer are that it performs logical
operations upon data, according to a stored list of instructions (known
as a program). *how* it performs the operations, how the data is stored
or transfered, etc are all irrelevant.

Given the above basic principles, the virus has to either have physical
access to the computer, or the computer has to have a "back door".
Otherwise it can\'t infect. 

A "back door" would consist of a set of instructions in the computer (a
subprogram) telling it to execute files received in certain ways that
met certain criteria. Then the virus could just arrange to have itself
sent over the proper channel and appear to meet the criteria (say a
specific file header or file extension).

Where did I say it is "unrealistic"? FTL per se does not violate the
laws of the universe. In fact there are a lot of people who have tried
very hard for decades to find a way to prove that FTL *would* violate
the laws of phsyics. And they\'ve had little luck.

But the laws of aerodynamics didn\'t change. And for that matter, there
is a big difference between the laws of mathematics and the laws of
physics. 

The laws of phsyics can\'t be proven, only approximated. That\'s what the
scientific method *does*, enable us to improve the approximation.

The laws of mathematics and logic are *provable*. They *don\'t* change,
nor do they in any way depend on the technology that may make *use* of
them to do something.

You confuse technology, science, and mathematics. Much of the logic
that any computer operates on dates back to *before* Aristole! It is in
no way dependent on *any* technology.

In 1700 BCE they understood how to add, subtract, multiply and divide.
And they had a pretty good grasp of geometry. They probably had the
beginnings of logic as well. None of those depend on technology.

You confuse the *computer* and the *program*. We couldn\'t understand
their computers. We could most definitely understand their programs, it
might take a bit, but we could. And we wouldn\'t have any trouble
understanding the *logic* they use. I\'m talking the mathematical logic,
not the "electronic logic".

It does not *matter* whether you perform an "And" operation
mechanically (like Babbage\'s difference engine), with relays, with
dicrete resistors and transistors, with simple ICs, with massively
intergrated ICs using whatever semiconductor, with quantum computers,
or with some technology we can\'t even dream of. The *logical operation*
remains the same. And it\'s been known for a couple of thousand years!
Ditto for OR, NOT, adding, subtracting, on thru the compares and
branches that make up all of programming when you get down to the
lowest level. 

Again, technology, science, and mathematics are *seperate* things.
Technology changes, new technologies get discovered, become common, and
then fade into history. Science, ever science the discovery of the
scientific method, *expands*. What\'s true will remain true, though it
may get qualifiers added. Mathematics is independent of reality.
Mathematical principles don\'t become obsolete. 2+2=4 whether you do it
by counting with pebbles, using an abacus, or a supercomputer.

And the laws of computer programming a *purely* mathematical.

And here\'s the rub. There are systems where emote execution is *never*
done. Most military systems for example. And even where it is done,
there are safeguards. No rational system designer would design a system
that would accept a transmission for an outside location and execute
the result unconditionally. 

But that\'s what\'s required for the virus to spread. It has to be able
to send something to another system and get that system to execute it
(with root privleges!) even though there\'s no conceivable *reason* for
the other system to allow that. 

*Why* would a transponder be authorized to make a system it is attached
to remotely execute code sent from the transponder? And why would the
life support control computer or the weponry control systems have *any*
system authorized to send them code to be remotely executed? (If I was
a pirate, I\'d *love* to find a ship setup that way. Get someone on
board and you can take out weapon, life support, maybe even propulsion)

So again we are back to the old "the Virus uses a back door that exists
on all systems". And given even *recent* history, that\'s *stupid*.

Do recall that there was quite a flap a few years back (shortly *after*
they nuked most of SDI) when it came out that the X-ray laser program
had lots of theory and damn little results (something about the
underground blasts that they were testing X-ray laser configurations
with having shown *no* evidence of useful lasing!)

I didn\'t say it was. The motile is crwaling from the transponder to the
NON-TRANSPONDER COMPUTERS linked to the transponder.

Sorry, wrong answer. They did not prey on other chips "remotely". They

Right.

No. It had acces to whatever computers have a reason to be linked to an
IFF transponder!

Huh? Sorry, but all it would have "learned" are the comm protocols and
data formats coming down the links from systems that were attached to
it. To determine the "logic" of those systems it would have to
*physically* examine them. And an uninfected transponder has no reason
to do that. In fact, if it did, there\'d have been screams of outrage
from everyone, because it couldn\'t be hidden for long.

The transponder just sits there happily gabbing with other transponders
and sucking power.

Nope, because the transponder had no such knowledge. Nor any *need* for
it.

Being able to interface means being able to *communicate*. Being able
to take over requires a lot more. That\'s the point I *tried* to make
with the motile. You don\'t know *anything* about how a computer on the
other end of a datalink works. All you know is that it is capable of
sending data in an agreed upon protocol. 

We can link PCs, DEC minis (Vaxen), and IBM mainframes over a network.
But every single one of them *translates* the data from internal format
to the network\'s standard format inside the network interface card. Or
else with a driver resident in the machine. You can\'t tell which kind
of machine is on the other side of the interface just by looking at the
datastream. (Well, if the "machine name" is something like "vaxone" you
can guess, but...)

Well, given that don\'t need to refuel very *often*, I\'d say that they
wouldn\'t bother. If I recall correctly, ships have required
maintainence that happens a *lot* more often than refueling does. So
combining refueling with the annual overhaul would make a lot of sense.
So you don\'t need to make it all *that* easy to refuel.

Expense is just a matter of the fuel being inherently more expensive.
But that is likely offset by the infrequency of refueling. After all,
it might sound outrageuos to have a car that cost $1000 to refuel. But
if it only needs to be refueled once a year, that suddenly looks a lot
better. :-)

I think our difference here is that there\'s no reason for the link to
the infected computer to be set up to accept commands, rather than
data. And there are a lot of good reasons *not* to set it up that way.

Of course, if I have the PC running in protected mode, and I have the
comm session running in a restricted segment, not much is going to
happen except that there\'ll be a access violation the first time the
worm tries to access anything the comm session wasn\'t allowed access to.

Of course on a 386 and up system, if you are allowed access to the
right things, you can *exit* protected mode. On a 286, that requires
access to a specific port *and* knowing how that system is set up to
allow playing games to get out of protected mode. And if it\'s an old
enough 286, you *can\'t* do it. (some old 286 systems don\'t support the
"controlled CPU reset" trick used to get from protected mode to real
mode)

Ah! But if there is external *communication*, but not external

Heck, even easier if all you want to do is kill the system. A number of
systems using the 6845 CRT controller could be fried by writing the
right data to it. And other systems have other shortcomings.

Some of them, while quite subtle and thus capable of doing all sorts of
nasties, are just more work than is needed given the *known* security
holes. Why bother with things like compromising the compilers (You do
know about that one don\'t you?)

As *presented* it\'s illogical. Any of a number of assumptions makes it
workable. It\'s just that they not only didn\'t state them, they seem to
have been trying to say that they weren\'t needed.

It\'s also a good example of a *nasty* trick to play on a lower tech
group. It\'s something that is beyond their technical skills, but close
enough that it looks like they *could* pull it off.

Do this with a weapon design, and you\'ve got a great way to keep that
petty dictator busy until he\'s wasted enough money and resources to let
his neighbors (or his population) overthrow him.

I\'d say they could. *BUT*, they may be able to read just enough to get
themselves into *real* trouble. Word meanings change over time. A
couple of examples:

"making love" used to mean "courting" or perhaps "flirting" would be
closer. "Roger", a commonly used phrase in radio traffic <g> was *not*
a word one used in polite society in the 1600s or 1700s (definitely
modern English). "Awful" used to mean "full of awe" or "causing awe".
"Artificial" meant "showing great artifice (skill)". 

So just guess what sort of booby traps may be waiting for the players.
Look at what happened to "awful". "Something awful will happen" changed
meaning 180 degrees over a few centuries. If that happened with a
technical term, or some phrase commonly used on controls they could
*really* "roger" themselves. :-)

Surely a better way to take out the virus would be Donkey Kong? That\'s
a *lot* more computationally intensive than Asteroids.

Rob,

I\'m forwarding this to the lists not to increase bandwidth usage, but 
because I think it is important that others see your message and my reply.

First, let me say that I have not been inflexible in the amount of 
quoting I do.  When I saw the first post in XTML that complained about 
the amount of quoting, I began paying more attention to that.  While I 
may have occasionally slipped since then (I\'ve been on-line 
for many years, and old habits die hard), I feel I\'ve done a good job of 
keeping the quoting to that necessary to allow everyone - even those who 
haven\'t seen the original post (for instance, new subscribers, those 
who have been away on holiday, or those who simply, for whatever reason, 
didn\'t read the message I am replying to) - to follow the conversation.  

When I originally subscribed to these lists, I posted many of my house 
rules in Xboat, as you may recall if you subscribed at that time.  I have 
also tried to contribute meaningfully to the conversations ongoing.    
But, I noted that there were increasing complaints from some XMLers 
regarding the level of cross-posting and the number of lines quoted, so 
I stopped posting to XTML for the most part.  All of my new material 
appears only on TML.  

Since I want to have the widest possible audience for my contributions, 
it makes the most sense to post to the "all games welcome here" TML 
rather than the splinter-sect "Only CT and MT" XTML - even though I\'m 
primarily a CT referee.  

Now that I\'ve received your email complaint regarding the amount of 
quoting I do on TML, I\'m beginning to wonder whether posting to these 
lists is worth it at all.  Who needs to hear the numerous complaints 
about wasted bandwidth, when I\'m spending my free time trying to join in 
with the many other great people here who are enhancing the Traveller 
experience?  It\'s not like I quote entire posts and add only "yeah, I 
agree."  Every time I post, I try to add something meaningful to the 
discussion.  I may or may not succeed, depending on your perspective, but 
that is always my attempt.

I have been on-line for many years, and have developed a style of 
posting that I think conveys the most information in the best method.  
Others feel differently, and that\'s OK.  But I do not believe in the 
theory that X lines of quoting is going to work every time...no matter 
what number you substitute for X.  Some say 2 lines, and others would 
rather see no quoting.  I try to quote enough so that anyone coming into 
the conversation without having access to older posts will be able to 
follow the conversation.  I do this because I believe what we discuss 
here is that important.  

I admit that the current humor thread has perhaps too much quoting, but I 
took that as a part of the humor of the situation.  That thread is a 
parody of all the arguments we\'ve had recently, and I\'m enjoying it.  The 
fact that it\'s gotten to seven or so levels of quoting is part of the 
humor precisely because of people such as yourself who have posted to the 
lists asking for less quoting - another type of flame, which is being 
parodied.

If I\'ve been out of line in my quoting style because the mailing list 
culture is different from usenet and BBS culture, then I apologize.  If 
the people who contribute to this list feel that is the case, then I will 
change my ways.

I agree. I am designing a TL7-8 monitor and fission is the best choice
for power. I do think that the evolutionary chain of engineering
development would indicate the fragile nature of fission systems. There
would be pressure to put armor around the reactor in military systems.
On the other hand, there would also be safety systems to eject
radioactive debris into space and away from crewed areas.

IMO there should be an armor *requirement* for fission reactors on
combat vessels. The requirement could be a rule expressly stating such,
or a bad effect from combat that the designers want to avoid. The armor
requirement should be broken down into safety systems and actual
protection. This is a case where the FFS subsystem armor actually is
needed.

This is, while technically the truth, a distortion of the facts...  
The Third Reich in 1934-36 (when most of the anti-semitic laws was 
passed, was a democracy in name only).  Hitler basically wrote the 
laws, gave a speech before the Reichstag (which was a rubber stamp 
body, with all opposition parties banned by this time), and turned 
the Gestapo loose...  

Facts are that the Weimar Republic was dead a full year before Hitler 
came to power, when Hindenburg began rule by emergency decree.  The 
last year before Hitler was basically deciding what sort of 
government would succeed it.

Nonetheless, the vast majority of Democratic or Republican forms of 
government have fallen due to internal turmoil.  Then again the same 
can be said of monarchies, military governments, dictatorships, 
etc...

Hell, let\'s face it, the US is a government of nobility.  How many 
working class people have been elected President.  If you realize 
that the majority of people aren\'t even registered to vote, and half 
of them don\'t vote, most elections are decided by about 25% of the 
populace.  In local elections, its even less.  This sure as hell 
doesn\'t meet the classical definition of a democracy...

Joe, I did not perceive your quotings as being out of line.  
Sometimes I\'ll pick up something in mid thread, and somebody who 
does useful quoting is a blessing then.

<Big SNIP>

Much worse on bandwidth than people quoting each other has been the 
topics of discussions recently, of which I have been guilty in the 
past.  Has anybody here ever read the FAQ?????  I now understand why the 
Virus and Rocks arguments are listed on there as done to death!

After watching the flame wars on this list regarding virus in the 
past few weeks, I think we ought to change to a less controversial 
subject, like ABORTION or RELIGION, for example!!!!!

About a week ago, I came to the conclusion that no more meaningful 
discussion on the topic of virus could be had within the confines of 
this list.  It had degenerated into 2 sides both of which were more 
determined to prove that they were 100% right than to try to learn 
from the other, which IS after all, THE POINT of debate, anyways...

For the aforementioned week, I have made it a point not to read 
ANY postings with the word Virus in the subject heading...  I can 
assure you that a lot of the lurkers out there are doing the same.  
In fact if you really pay attention to the list, the lurkers are dropping 
like flies...2 or 3 of them are unsubscribing a day, most since the 
virus and rocks debates started happening.  You all may have been 
saying something useful (though I doubt it), but if it had Virus in 
the title, it probably didn\'t even get skimmed by me.

We\'ve just about let the rocks argument die.  Back off on the Virus 
arguments, and take them off the list to private e-mail if you 
please.  Believe me, there is no intelligent or new point that can be 
made, that hasn\'t already been made about a thousand times in the 
past 3 weeks already...usually in ALLCAPS.

Sorry to rage for a while, but this is really getting old...  :-(

Untrue.  Both games use the same spatial, temporal, and unit scales.  
Both are purely tactical simulations.  Fifth Frontier War is an example 
of a "grand strategic" game.  In general, \'tactics\' describes how a 
particular battle is fought, when opposing units move into engagement; 
\'strategy\' describes how forces are deployed so as to fight engagements 
favorable to your objectives.  To use a real-world example, the decision 
of where and when to stage the invasion of France in 1944 was strategic; 
the process of actually taking the five beaches was tactical.

Because a game must be somewhat focussed to be playable, strategic 
simulations usually feature hightly abstract combat-resolution and unit 
type rules, while tactical simulations contain little information about 
the reasons for the battle, potential alternate goals for either side, or 
the effect of simultaneous battles elsewhere on the front.

It is frequently convenient to define a level between \'strategic\' and 
\'tactical\' called \'operational\'.  The operational scale is distinguished 
by being small enough that, for example, artillery units have a 
noticeable range, and questions of terrain and maneuver become 
meaningful.  However, units still represent many troops and/or vehicles, 
and combat resolution remains abstract.  Avalon Hill\'s Panzerblitz and 
Panzer Leader games were at the low end of operational scale, and SPI\'s 
The Next War at the (very) high end.  Closer to home, Invasion: Earth is 
a good example of operational scale.

I would guess a good reason for "upgrading" to a larger and more expensive TL9 
Fusion plant would be lower overhead.  The Fusion plants are assumed to be 
fueled by hydrogen, while the fission plants would need more expensive and less 
easily handled fuel rods.  Not a big deal over a couple of years, but if you 
are expecting 20+ years of service, the extra cost is more than made up by the 
convenience and low upkeep of the fusion plant.   Just a guess, but it makes 
sense.  This would need to be expanded into actual "game rules" of course; cost 
of fission fuel rods, how long they last, etc.


Oh, yeah...

        Except the Cymbeline transponder chip IS SEMI-SENTIENT and IS
VULNERABLE to a species of Cymbeline chip that Survival Margin specifically
states preys on other chips FROM A DISTANCE by "convincing" them to recode
themselves. Once you\'ve taken over the transponder, which by Imperial law
HAS access to the rest of the system, you\'re in.

        Mind you, all this assumes you can buy the whole Cymbeline "sentient
chip" thingy and the idea of their use as universal transponders which
nobody knows are talking to each other nonstop ... I had trouble. So in my
universe I didn\'t explain Virus in detail. It made a good plot device. I
assumed its effects had been wildly exagerrated by fear and paranoia, and
decided that the truth had been lost and the players had no way of finding
it out, at least at first. Since I lost my group before they ever got
anywhere near needing a decent explanation...

        Sorry, wrong answer. Read survival margin p71 or p79 "... \'wild

"remotely," not *physically*.

        p70, Survival margin, " ... from their own ship\'s main computer core
and databanks, to which the transponders have unimpeded access." The basic
assumption that the ship\'s main computer had a reason to be linked to the
rest of the ship\'s systems is left for the student.

        Why does it have to *physically* examine it? First of all, it had
"unimpeded access." Try giving unimpeded access to some people I know, even
over a dumb terminal. They *will* get into your system without ever having
to *physically* access it.

        It had *need* because it was constantly accessing ("unimpeded") the
main computer. After all, it\'s job isn\'t just to sit there and squawk "I\'m
the Free Trader Beowulf, AWK!" See p70 of Survival Margin again. It has to
not only convince the other ship\'s transponders it\'s who it says it is, it
has to convince the other guy it hasn\'t been tampered with, and the ship
isn\'t a threat.

        Does it save to *anything* other than .vsd? Most Windows programs
will let you export to .wmf. And I\'m *sure* it\'ll let you cut a drawing and
paste it into another program that DOES export to wmf.

        As for getting GIFs or JPGs, you can use something like LView to
capture the windows to a gif file.

        So you\'re saying a neural network is NOT a computer. A true neural

        No. The "laws of computer programming" AS WE KNOW THEM today have a
mathematical bent. But not completely. You generally have to use a special
programming language to be able to *prove* a program is correct, for example.

I came to the same conclusion right before I posted that apology for

I really don\'t mind the arguments that never die.  I don\'t pay per byte, 
and deleting them is as simple as hitting one key.  What\'s starting to 
concern me is the fact that there are few other discussions going on.  
It\'s almost like Virus were taking over TML . . .

You\'ve never been served with a summons, have you?  Let me put it plainly:
I did not want to testify in the trial involved.  We didn\'t answer the
phone, I avoided my ususal hangouts.. did everything I could.

Then on the bus.. this guy looks at me.. says "Didn\'t you go to Leigh High
back in the early 80s?  On the speech team?"  I say yes, and he reaches over
to shake my hand, introducing himself.  I\'m a polite guy, I reach out and
state my name.

Whammo.  There was a summons in my hand, and my new "friend" informing me
that I had been served.

The recieveing computer may be dumb, but Virus is smart.  It may take weeks
for it to find a chink in the OS that allows it to take over.  Remember how
Dulinor bled ships after the release? (Survival Margin)  Dulinor\'s own
flagship made it back to Illiesh before Virus disabled it.

This is my last post on the subject.  Mr. Erickson seems to firmly believe
that since he cannot conceive of how to do it, it isn\'t possible.  Of
course, that\'s what a computer professional in the 1940s would have said if
you described the PC I\'m using right now.

The kinu, a silicon-based lifeform found on an inner world of the Quopist
system, has a feathery down composed of iridium/tungsten allow, density
(allowing for air gaps) approximately 8 g/cm3.  Conversely, the Sees\'nu
idols are small (approx. 4 cm) figurines surrounded by a light wicker
framework some 1.5 m across, decorated with haaneth blossoms and skra\'ana
hair, having a net density of about 1 g/cm3.  So yes, there\'s a big
difference. :)

Kinu-down pillows, by the way, find a ready market among the ascetic 
monks of the Ecatl-Chalchihuitl Community, whose monasteries dot the 
worlds of Lanth and Vilis subsectors.

You know, perhaps we should provide special trade rules for cases like 
this.  One might posit a separate category of cargo, covering extremely 
dense materials which make unusual demands on ship CG and propulsion 
systems.  Fees would be higher for cargos in this category.  
Hmmmm...dense metals...costs more...

How about "Bismuth Class"?

 Not necessarily true - Consider: the evolution of the modern
 European alphabets have all been traced back to Phoenician,
 Aramaic, and Hebrew; yet none of those writing forms is
 recognizable to a modern reader of any language except Hebrew -
 and the Hebrew reader would be unable to deal with Phoenician, and
 would have a bit of trouble with both Aramaic and to a lesser
 extent, old-style Hebrew.  Also, the Latin alphabet is derived
 from the older Greek alphabet (which is readable by modern
 Greeks), as is the Cyrillic, yet any one of the three languages
 will be unintelligible to anyone totally unschooled in it.

 Moreover, the evolution of _all_ modern forms from the ancient
 forms is really over the last 3,000 years; here, we\'re talking as
 much more time, with the availability of totally alien writing
 systems as well.  Further, the First Imperium doubtless used
 Vilani script (for thousands of years, IIRC); how likely is it
 that a _total_ conversion to Solomani Anglic could be accomplished
 over a mere 400 years, especially when you\'re dealing with at
 least 5,000 planets.  Only if a new system is easier to use than
 an old system is such a conversion likely to occur, and even then,
 it won\'t be a rapid conversion.

 All of the XVIIIc examples I can think of used a common alphabet,
 so that part of your theory has no backing - nor disproof.  On the
 other hand, I point out that Korea has been under Chinese
 suzerainty for most of its existence, yet it was a king from the
 Medieval period or before that created the modern Korean writing
 system (Hangul).  The Chinese have been bureaucrats \\par
 excellance et non-pareil\\ for centuries; do you not think that
 they would have tried to impose their writing system on Korea?
 (N.B. Hangul is something of a "planned" writing system; it didn\'t
 develop naturally from earlier systems.  Each of what looks to
 Western eyes like a single "character" [a la Chinese, or Japanese
 Kanji] is in fact built up out of up to three components - an
 initial consonant, a medial vowel, and a final consonant. [Gee,
 where have I seen that breakdown before?])  So, perhaps you\'re
 right about a particular culture keeping its own language and
 writing system.

 On the other side of the coin, there is the issue of translation
 and transcription.  When you are doing either for people that do
 not speak the source language, you are doing it into an alphabet
 that they recognize - usually, their own.  You do the best that
 you can, given that there may be sounds that are not normally or
 cannot be represented in the target language - for example, the
 tones in many of the oriental languages, or the gutturals in many
 middle eastern and eastern European languages.  Sometimes, you
 succeed reasonably well, as when you write "da svedanya" as a
 transcription of the Russian phrase of leave-taking.  Other times,
 you fail miserably, as when the early church missionaries to
 Ireland and Wales tried to transcribe what they heard, and came up
 with spellings that look impossible even centuries later, or when
 you try to transcribe Arabic or Hebrew (how do you transcribe a
 glottal stop, or the guttural sound that Germans write as Ch, but
 which sounds nothing like the initial or final sound of
 "church"?).

 I would be inclined to believe that whenever two literate cultures
 come into contact, each will maintain its own system of writing,
 and its own sound values for the glyphs, even if the spoken
 language itself is ultimately discarded.  Thus, at the fall of the
 Second Imperium, much of the bureaucratic paperwork was still done
 in the Vilani writing system, even if it may have sounded like
 badly accented Anglic when you tried to pronounce it.  Not to
 mention the notorious lack of speed with which bureaucracies tend
 to move, especially when it comes to replacing equipment...

 Differentiating between various dialects of Galanglic could mean
 two different things.  You could have (a) an English-like system,
 where there are minor differences in sound values, spellings, and
 vocabularies (picture a Brooklynite speaking to an Australian from
 Melbourne), or (b) a Chinese-like situation, where the spoken
 language is incomprehensible from one region to another, but the
 written language is identical over the whole country.  For most
 adventuring parties, it probably won\'t matter; for something like
 the DGP Grand Tour, or the Arrival Vengeance mission, it becomes
 important.  I suspect that GDW took option (a); there was never
 anything during ArrVen that suggested that language was a problem.
 I would hope that there would be some discussion of this in
 Traveller when it is released, or in subsequent JTAS articles or
 game supplements.

 Probably - but those mundanities are what gives those kinds of
 pictures verisimilitude - something I feel is very important.  But
 that\'s just my opinion.

 Actually, that sound is somewhere between B and V, as we think of
 them, and there were two different transcription systems.  The one
 that gave us the name of the planet used a V; this was later
 changed when the language tables were drawn up.  Incidentally, I
 note for the record that the "B" in AAB stands for "Bilandin",
 so...

 Go look at some old maps of the Far East, spanning several
 decades.  You\'ll find that there\'s a city marked as the capital of
 China whose name is variously spelled "Peiping", "Peking", and
 "Beijing".  Which one is correct?

I agree here, too.  I appreciate the fact that someone else considers that I
may not have been keeping up with a thread long enough to respond.  I\'m not
yet to the point that I say, "If Joe talks about it then its good enough for
me!!"  But I do appreciate the insight that I\'ve seen from Joe and Others on
the list.  Joe, and others, represent to me the background in Classic
Traveller that I never had.  I also have found Joe\'s "House Rules" valuable,
although I would like to have a bound hardback copy, I\'ll have to settle for
the Email version.

I agree that arguement is getting us nowhere, and I regret that some folks
still insist on arguing on these topics, but I\'m trying to understand what
the ANTI-VIRUS group is trying to say.  I\'m not a computer guru, and I\'m new
to the net (Less than a year), so my background doesn\'t help me in
understanding.  I\'ve tried posting to private addresses, but most of the
time, my post doesn\'t get answered because the person is spending all their
time answering the srguements from the list, so I post to the List to get an
answer.  Sorry if this is bad.  I\'ll try to go back to private postings, but
if I don\'t get any answers, I\'m gonna try here again.  I may be the
exception, but I WANT TO UNDERSTAND!!

  Individual characters that have appropriate skills can use them in lieu
of the game defaults for certain tasks. eg, PCs with sensor skills can
substitute their sensor skill, captains can use their tactics skills,
gunners can use their gunnery skills, etc.

  BL is quite good if all the players know the game, it is a bit
cumbersome to learn though. I personally dislike the way the game flows,
but it\'s way better (as far as realism goes) than most other space games
on the market.

The number DGP claimed was 15.77 trillion, pre-Rebellion.  Some of the
MT materials like _Survival Margin_ refer to the "fifteen trillion"
citizens of the Imperium in passing.  I think that this is comparable
to the population of Larry Niven\'s ringworld, which gives you an idea
how big *that* thing is.     

Unfortunately, a fair number of the on-line sector files are junk, as
Wildstar pointed out.  You have to examine them to determine just how
far they can be trusted -- there\'s some obvious problems.  So these
figures are hard to verify.  

To recap Wildstar\'s results for the Imperium:
  Population:                16.73 trillion (US)
  Gross Imperial Product:    TCr 317425   
  Imperial Mil Budget:       TCr   2195
  Planetary Army Budgets:    TCr   2237 (local)
  Planetary Navy Budgets:    TCr   4429 (local) 

I did a similar analysis, but from the point of view of using the WTH colony
rules in a rough manner to test it and previous estimates.  My results are
in the Missouri archive at

  http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/TNE/Imperial_Economies.txt

and treats the Imperium as a 15.77 trillion, tech-12 colony world, with the
average Imperial starport (assumed to be class-B).  I got results that were
in the same order of magnitude as Wildstar\'s, but with a slightly different
slant.  To sum up some relevant comparisons and data: 
  Population:               15.77 trillion (US)
  Gross Imperial Product:   TCr 538000 (TL12, port B credits)
  Military Personnel:       0.16 trillion (US) (1.0% of population)
    with civilian dependents, support: add 0.47 trillion (US) 
  Naval Personnel:          126 million (US) (0.08% of military) 
  Space units:              42000 "major", 126000 "minor"
  Military Base value:      TCr 8820
  Military Base upkeep:     TCr  423
  
All military figures include both Imperial and local forces.  Notice that
while the navy *looks* small, the ships are so expensive that it helps keep
the size of the service down.

If you adjust my GIP for Imperial (TL15, port A) credits, it\'s TCr 430400.
This makes GIP per capita about Cr 27300.  Wildstar figures Cr 19000. 
In today\'s USA, personal income averages about 80% of GDP per capita, so 
figure the average income (my figures) as Cr 21840.  In MegaTraveller, 
the annual upkeep for SocSt 7 is Cr 21000.  However, you could argue that
that should be *local* credits.  If you take my figures as a high estimate
and Wildstar\'s as a fairly conservative estimate, we\'re both in the right
ballpark.

Actually Dulinor\'s ship made it back to Illiesh because the Virus on 
board let it.  This virus, realizing that Dulinor was taking him home 
tagged along and infected as many computers along the way as it could.

Absolutely, but you don\'t think the Zhodani, Solomani and Aslan didn\'t 
try that too?   And they\'ve got way better resources than a group of

But you still nedd *something* to tell the reactor "Ok, we don\'t need

Whether you disperse the fuel a bit, or use control rods, you do need
to *do* something to shut the thing off.

Ok. Though this is going to require either physical contact, *close*

And phsyical contact fits best of all.

"unimpeded access" to the *information* is not necessarily the same as
being able to execute there. And it likely isn\'t.

Which is why the system isn\'t likely to require *write* access to the

would be less than thrilled by the chips.

Good. At last a flat out statement that it *can\'t* infect everything,

You\'ve got my comments. Note that I only flat out disagree in two
places. I just think that their wording in #9 needs a lot of work. It
fits my model as well as the one I\'ve been arguing about. It just
implies something that doesn\'t fit with #1 very well (unless you take
the psi option)

I also note that the quotes flat out contradict lot of the *pro* virus

Check it out. Real sniper teams *do* go for head shots. And as I
understand it, they tend towards custom rifles with muzzle velocities
around 1500 m/s. Less drop, and they can shoot from farther out. 

Gives "reach out and touch someone" a whole new meaning.

BTW, I understand that some folks use the Barrett .50 cal as a sniper
weapon. That\'s what I assumed above. Like I said, it\'d take nattele
dress to survive a hit from *that*. :-)

(God that rifle is a beautiful weapon. Pity it costs a small fortune)

Well, actually, electric motors would work just fine to run these.

But picture a ship from some planet that made it into space on their
own, and uses analytical engines in the ships. Now it meets a Virus
infected ship (an unarmed one). Even if they have the radio hooked into
the AE somehow, it\'s gonna be a *long* time before the virus infects
*that* system. 

For even more fun, consider someplace that got mechanical computers
working and managed to get to micro-machining before getting to
semiconductors. They could have near nanotech level computers that were
purely mechanical, and smaller and faster than ours. We are *almost* to
the point where we could implement an AE in silicon with gears and cams
only microns across.

We have (or had) a TV series here in the US based on a guy who was a

I\'m not going to deal with the Cyrillic alphabet, since it, too, is a 
designed alphabet (vide St. Cyril).  As for your other examples, they\'re
irrelevant to the current discussion, since all such development took
place in pre-modern largely-illiterate societies.  All the "evolution"
and "derivation" took place via slow commercial and social contact, and
changes are easily propagated when the total number of literate citizens
lies somewhere in the hundreds, say, rather than the millions or billions.
So far as I can see, the greater the number of people who are literate,
the more resistant the underlying alphabet to change.  And the possibility
of change in the Galanglic alphabet, rather than the pre-modern development
_of_ that alphabet, was what the original question was about.

But, again, barring total loss of widespread literacy and education (which 
appears not to be the case for the Sylean Federation during the Long Night),
3,000 years of "modern" history should not show anywhere _near_ the amount
of change exhibited in 3,000 years of "pre-modern" history.  Do you see
the immense differences in social background?

I never argued for a wholesale change by the entire populace to Anglic. My
argument was that the language of government and big business was likely
to become Anglic, and Anglic would supplant Vilani as a prime second language
for non-Vilani speakers.  Vilani would very likely survive on heavily-
populated industrial worlds taken over by the advancing Solomani, and
indeed would probably contribute heavily in terms of new vocabulary and
slang as the two cultures intertwined.  At least in the near-term, much
of the populace is likely to begin to gain familiarity with _both_ writing
systems.  But the deck is stacked in favor of Anglic if political, economic,
and military power remains with the Solomani overlords.

Mind you, Vilani will remain a potent and popular language on many worlds: 
we know the Solomani were stretched rather far in their occupation, and
even over four hundred years some of the coreward worlds where Vilani were
numerous and Solomani even scarcer may well have shifted naturally to using
Vilani completely for local use and translating interstellar edicts that
come down in Anglic.

I\'m curious: where does the "at least 5,000 planets" come from?  (I don\'t
have my copy of Vilani & Vargr handy).  I\'ve always suspected that the
Ziru Sirka was rather thinly spread, settling only the most hospitable
planets or those containing minor races which "had" to be put down. 
(That\'s the only way I\'ve found to explain away the odd growth pattern
shown in canonical maps: the bulk of development stayed comfortably close
to Vland, without threading the Corridor isthmus, for example.  But a
significant number of minor races, contacted by traders prior to the
Vilani consolidation, forced Sharurshid (I believe the most rimward of
the bureaux) to expand farther and more rapidly than the other two.
But Vilani expansion, rather than language, is probably grist for another
thread.  (ANYTHING to save us from rock-dropping and Virus! :-)

We should go look at the British occupation of Egypt and the other Arabic
countries.  Despite the presence of far more Arabic speakers, English was
the language of governance, and the Latin alphabet rather than the Arabic
the one for governmental decrees.  Had that situation persisted centuries
further, I suspect that English would have come to dominate more and more: 
a direct analog of the Anglic-Vilani situation.  At least, IMHO.  As you
say, the Solomani occupation and following Long Night lacks any good
historical precedent.

I\'m familiar with Hangul, though not with Korean history in detail.  Again,
it\'s a premodern situation without widespread public literacy and education
to swing the balance one way or the other.  I suspect that Chinese *was* 
the language to use to "get ahead" during the Chinese occupation... but 
once the foreign overlords were thrown out, Hangul was a fine gesture of 
native patriotism and a way to thumb the nose at the foreigners.  We\'ve
seen very little of radical Vilani (aside from Zid Rachele and others who
surfaced in early pre-MT Digest Group publications), but I suspect that
the Syleans may well encounter their fair share of proud Vilani-speaking
worlds who overthrew their Ramshackle Empire governors.  Adventure seed!

But technology would help, too, with replacing the written language!  I\'m
sure, just for reasons of practicality, that new Solomani governors would
allow their subjects to fill out forms in their "usual" alphabet... but it
would be fairly trivial to reprogram the computers so that the stored
documents, which the (Solomani) governors will keep for access, hold the
Anglic transliterations/translations.  If the government refuses to change
from its native alphabet, and has technology to collect information in
foreign alphabets but then "correct" it, then even written Vilani has
little hope for survival, IMHO, over the course of several centuries,
let along millenia.  All that will remain is Anglicized vocabulary.

I find language problems a splendid spur to role-playing.  I hope, too,

Yes, I\'d wondered if that was a sign of a change in transliteration, but
hadn\'t remembered the AAB -- good catch!  I\'m just amused that the change
was never mentioned in canonical Traveller (I presume your explanation
above is IYHO, unless you can provide a citation).

One of the reasons the Marines have the "everybody carries a rifle" rule
is because they have *no* logistical tail, this is covered by other
services. (eg, Navy provides transport and medical, while army provides
things like massed artillery and long-duration garrison support)

This doesn\'t mean Marines are more "elite", just that they have a
different mission and train/organise appropriately.

Dunno about bound hardback copies, but I\'ve been told by IG that I will 
have permission to publish material for T4.  At this point my wife and I are 
unsure what form those will take, though.  Initially, it will almost 
certainly be something less than hardback.  

BTW, lest anyone misunderstand, I\'ve no plans to make oodles of money off 
of my ideas.  That\'s a pipe-dream in the world of RPGs for most people, 
really.  I just want to publish them, and make back what I put into 
them.  It\'d be nice to have my ideas in print, and that is the 
essential impetus for me.  (Besides, I like having a set of rules to hold 
in my hand, add to my collection of Traveller material, etc. and a 
printout just isn\'t the same.  I figure there must be others like me.)

I was thinking along the lines of the type of books that used to be 
published for CT by Paranoia Press, FASA, and Gamelords Ltd (36-48 pp, 
digest-sized).  Price would be something like US $5.00.   (Assuming there 
is demand....I\'ve done work on figuring the costs involved, but if I 
could sell several hundred, the cost structure will be better than if I 
see a demand for only a few, naturally.)

I haven\'t mentioned anything in the past because the plans weren\'t set - 
and still aren\'t, really.  I have material worked up, but a lot of it is 
pending getting my hands on a copy of T4.  I have world data, culture 
data, adventure outlines, etc. etc....but nowhere to put that world in 
the new milieu, for example.  (Same goes for character types - until I 
know for sure how IG is handling character creation, I can\'t come up with 
a final product.  Additional rules - same thing.)

Anyway, we\'ll see what happens.  It\'s still a dream at this point.  In 
another couple of months, though....who knows?

Bruce,

Arrghh!  When I wrote that, I didn\'t really think it through.  My intent 
was not to whine and say I\'m going to take my ball and go.  Gadzooks.  
Serves me right for posting first thing in the morning.  

My usual rule is, no one knows when I read any given message, so if it 
upsets me, I wait a few hours until I can approach it calmly and 
rationally.  I didn\'t do that, and I\'m suffering for it.  Please, 
everyone, just forget I said that.

Anyway, thank you for the nice comment!

I\'ve never seen that as a problem.  It\'s funny how mistaken I was about 
mailing lists until I subscribed to this one.  I thought it\'d be a bunch 
of stuck-up snobs (else, why not have a newsgroup, which would allow 
unrestricted access to all?).  Although I wanted very badly to discuss 
Traveller, I resisted subscribing because of that mistaken belief.  Of 
course, I know now that there are many advantages of discussing things 
via a mailing list rather than a spam-prone newsgroup.  Subscribing to 
these lists has been an educational experience for me...on many levels.  


(Oh, and while I am on the topic of mistaken beliefs, I have been meaning 
to mention that one of the biggest reasons I didn\'t buy TNE was the names 
on the supplements.  I know, I was judging the book by its cover 
(literally!), but perhaps I wasn\'t the only prospective customer GDW 
missed because of that.  I saw "Fire, Fusion and Steel," "Brilliant 
Lances," and "Battle Riders," and got these respective impressions: 
"Cyberpunk," "Fantasy," "Fantasy."  Then I saw the "Vampire Fleets" 
supplement, and I was sure they\'d completely perverted Traveller.  It 
seemed like they\'d added every RPG fad that came along - cyberpunk, the 
renaissance in fantasy gaming that came with the new AD&D rules with 
their endless stream of "complete..." books, and the gothic horror fad.  
"Great, cyberpunk fantasy with vampires thrown in for good measure," I 
thought.  Of  course, none of those books were about any of those 
things.  But those titles made not even want to bother with reading the 
back of them, let alone open them up.  Just a cautionary tale.  Make it 
clear from the title what the subject matter is - even if that means 
renaming a plot device from "Vampire Fleets."  This all probably sounds 
quite silly to those of you where had actually purchased TNE and 
therefore knew the source of these terms and/or had faith enough to open 
the darned things up.   But, as I said, maybe others, unfamiliar with 
Traveller, reacted as I did.  Anyway...)

The content makes my jaw drop.  I never dreamed there were so many people 
so willing to put so much time into the game I love.  All the detail work 
for starships, missiles, population, taxation....wow!

Let\'s make a critical distinction here.  There is a world of difference
between police and military snipers.  Let\'s address military first.

Military snipers are trained in doing head shots.  They prefer not to.
They are, in a military situation, probably unnecessary.  Getting close
enough to be sure of one implies that you are in effective range of
the target and his friends\' small arms; that is an undesirable state
for a military sniper.  Most prefer 400+ meter engagements if they are
dealing with groups of unfriendly targets.  That\'s a bit much for an
effective head shot under field conditions with uncertain range.
Any sniper round is going to penetrate current body armor even
at those ranges, and almost certainly incapacitate the target
enough to prevent accurate return fire at *least*.  Military snipers
usually play the law of averages and accept moderate lethality shots
in exchange for being able to do so many many times between mean
effective rounds of return fire.

Police snipers live and breathe head shots.  Their job is to handle
one situation basically, which is some armed nut or criminal who is
going to kill someone (hostage, police officer, whoever) if they don\'t
take the shot promptly.  Often, the target has a gun on a hostage.
Under those conditions, if you shoot him and he isn\'t dead right then,
he can still kill the hostage.  That more or less mandates head shots,
and not just any head shot.  And typical maximum ranges in urban and
suburban police / SWAT encounters are only a hundred meters or so
anyways so it\'s not that much of a problem to do the head shots.
While it isn\'t unknown, effective counterfire against police snipers
is very rare, and with all things considered they will take head shots
if they have to shoot, most of the time.

The different types of engagements and tactics affect the equipment used.
Police usually use bolt action, moderate caliber rifles (say, .308 Win,
though many are bigger) with large scopes, "bull" heavy barrels, and 
bipods.  These heavy rifles are specialized much like competition
target rifles for maximum accuracy and don\'t care that much about
weapon system weight.  Military use varieties of weapons, but usually
lighter and paradoxically for the relative engagement ranges less
precise/accurate rifles.  They have to lug the gun around out in the
field where the police don\'t have to carry it more than a block.
They also tend to stay away from gadgets, finely tuned rifles, etc.
and stick to more robust systems which will keep plugging away after
being covered in dust, shaken, and sitting out in the rain some.

>From the time I was shown how to figure probabilities for die rolls, I\'ve 
loved doing that.  In fact, I\'ve applied to role-playing games most of the 
stuff I learned in the probability and statistics courses I took.  You can 
learn some neat stuff that way.  For instance, based on the fact that 
Traveller uses six characteristics ranged initially from 2-12, I found 
that there are 1,771,561 different characteristic sets that may be rolled 
up.  When you extend the range to the sixteen different values each 
characteristic may take on during the course of the game, you find there 
are 16,777,216 different sets of characteristics possible.  Discounting 
the characters with 0 in any characteristic, you come up with 11,390,625 
possible characteristic sets.

There are other uses for mathematics in Traveller, of course.  As an 
example, in creating new rules it is handy to know the probabilities of 
any given value coming up on 2D6.  Any one of you could (and possibly 
have) come up with this stuff, of course.  But, since I have it handy, I 
thought it might be useful to share it.  Maybe someone out there has been 
itching to make some new rules for Traveller, and this will provide him 
or her with some useful information.  I keep these charts handy when I\'m 
designing new systems or modifying old ones.

Here\'s some information on one of the standard Traveller tables, used for 
CT advanced character generation, TNE anagathic side effects, and many 
other things:

 10        3/36          .0833            8.33%
 11        2/36          .0555            5.55%
 12        1/36          .0277            2.77%


Notes:  If you add the decimal equivalents up, you\'ll get .9994.  For 
more accuracy, just extend the last number out to as many places as you 
like - they all repeat (ie, .0277 becomes .0277777777).  But I\'ve found 
this is plenty of accuracy for the work I do.
	If you want to develop a table like those used for assignment 
determination in the advanced character generation systems, and you want 
a given assignment to have a probability of X, just pick some rolls which 
have probabilities which add up to X.  For example, if I want something 
to have a 50% chance of occurring, I might choose to put that result next to 
the rolls 3,6,7,8 which add up to a probability of .4997 (49.97%).  This 
makes your table look jumbled, with gaps between similar results, however.


Here\'s another one you may find useful when designing your own rules.  
It\'s the basis of task rolls and almost all the Traveller rules that 
aren\'t covered by the table above.  

 2D	       	Probabilities
Roll	Fractional	Decimal		Percentage
  2+	  36/36          1.000            100.00%
  3+      35/36          .9722             97.22%
  4+      33/36          .9166             91.66%
  5+      30/36          .8333             83.33%
  6+      26/36          .7222             72.22%
  7+      21/36          .5833             58.33%
  8+      15/36          .4166             41.66%
  9+      10/36          .2777             27.77%
 10+	   6/36          .1666             16.66%
 11+       3/36          .0833              8.33%
 12+	   1/36          .0277              2.77%
 
Notes:  Again, I truncated the decimal values.  I\'ve never needed more 
accuracy, but if you do the same thing applies to this table as to the first 
one.  
	When designing a rule system based on this sort of die throw, 
remember to take into account the effects of any DMs you provide for.  If 
the average throw is going to have DM of +1, for example, it is necessary 
to allow for that skew (perhaps by increasing the die throw necessary, 
for instance, if having a common DM of +1 is important to the feel of the 
rule you are designing - otherwise, drop those DMs that are making it 
skewed.)


I hope this information will prove helpful.

   One of my favourite tricks is to ask _everybody_ for their dice during

   The look on their faces was usually quite gratifying, as long as you

    Heheh. We once had a D&D group that had problems with a particular
    thief character, one player got *real* fed up and hired a Hobbit
    assassin (this should date me _real_ bad) and asked him to "live"
    in his backpack for an adventure. The thief (as predicted) tried to
    pick his pack, and the assassin pops out and slits his throat (this is
    all done through notes and discussion with the GM beforehand) and
    promptly hides in the backpack again.

    GM politely asks the thief player for his character sheet, and proceeds
    with the gaming session. For the rest of the session the player sits
    there with a baffled look on his face, until his body was found.

    The funny part was almost _everybody_ was in on it, and NOBODY EVER told
    him what happened! <g>

True.  I was talking about damage problems, mostly.  If I remember
right, the operating temp is ~2400K or so (I wouldn\'t bet money on my
memory :).  With a decent containment vessel you\'d turn the power on and
off by turning the turbine on and off line.  I know what you mean,
though, there\'d be an outside moderator to shut it down.

Yeah, just because a GDW proclaimed that transponders were required
and then made the things tamper proof doesn\'t mean we have to play it
that way.  I liked, and I think the players did to, having Patrol
Boats pull the ship over for a spot check of their papers.  It always
gave them a chance to sound out a system..while trying to keep the

I\'ve got to agree here.  Despite my rantings on the previous post, 
the healthy argument on this list tells me that T4 has a very good

Today, maybe, but David Broussard was using information taken out of

Well, the simplest answer to this question is:  because.  The whole point 
of developing the Deyo transponder suite was to have a transponder system 
that could not be spoofed.  The Imperium wanted little electronic \'honest 
brokers\' to be sure that no (civilian) ship misrepresented itself.  To 
this end they not only developed the SDG-313F chips, which were more or 
less immune to unauthorized alteration (the \'black box\' in which they 
were contained would fry itself if ever opened or disconnected).  In 
order to cut down on crimes of commerce (piracy, barratry, smuggling, and 
the like), it was also required that the transponder suite be wired into 
the ship\'s computer, which was in turn wired into every other shipboard 
system.  Although no mention was made in "Survival Margin" of the true 
nature of this connection, it could be inferred from the text that the 
link between central computer and transponder suite was more or less 
"read-only." (at least as originally manufactured)

As far as the central, unified nature of a ship\'s computer architecture 
goes, it\'s a valid assumption that there were controls in place 
restricting which users and which systems were able to influence other 
systems.  DGP\'s "Starship Operator\'s Handbook," another great source of 
canon concerning shipboard operations, mentions these security measures.  
Your scenario regarding the passenger who gains control of the ship via a 
remote terminal isn\'t too far-fetched; it was one of the best ways of 
hijacking a starship, and at least as much effort was spent preventing 
these sorts of takeovers as was preventing the kind where armed force is 
used first.  A hijacking battle could easily be fought on two fronts, one 
with the hijackers and the crew engaged in armed conflict, and the other 
with each side\'s most competent computer experts fighting for control of 
the ship\'s systems.

Now, getting back to Virus:  We\'re in agreement up to the point where an 
infected system subverts the operation of an SDG transponder suite and 
burns its own design into the poor little Deyo chips.  We\'re not talking 
about a bit of program code here (nor are we talking about an Evil Space 
Ghost, to quote another Debunker) -- we\'re talking about a silicon-based 
life form that\'s just used its own method of reproduction (the original 
Cymbeline predator\'s electromagnetic \'cuckoo-call\') with the aid of 
man-made equipment.  So it\'s taken the transponder.  Now what?

The transponder\'s not just a computer that\'s running a new program.  It 
hasn\'t had new code loaded into memory and then executed -- it\'s actually 
been physically altered into a new device.  It\'s not just a horse by 
another name, it\'s something else entirely.  It\'s now a mule, a 
bloodthirsty, death-loving mule that sits back and plays the horse game, 
examining a computer system that at first it can only look at, but not 
touch.  The theory, as presented in "Survival Margin," is that it either 
finds and opening into the ship\'s computer, or it makes one.  Maybe it 
finds a bug like the old one in TRS-80 BASIC ("Sherman, set the Wayback 
Machine...") that dumps the user to the command prompt when he hits ENTER 
on a blank line when a numeric input was expected.  Maybe it sends 
voltage spikes to the interface until it gives up and becomes 
bi-directional.  Who knows?  This post is long enough already.
 
> So again we are back to the old "the Virus uses a back door that exists
> on all systems". And given even *recent* history, that\'s *stupid*. 

It may be stupid, but it\'s canon, unless you want to find and burn every 
extant copy of "Survival Margin."  Keep in mind that, despite other 
safegaurds against unauthorized entry, nobody really expected that the 
ship\'s transponder would ever do anything except inform the crew of 
invalid transponder returns and collate records on the ship\'s activities 
using its read-only link to the computer, so it\'s perhaps understandable 
that safeguards limiting the transponder\'s access were lax or 
non-existent.  Even the contemporary history of computer security 
includes examples of unforeseen weaknesses suddenly and disastrously 
exploited.  And nobody can dispute that history has a nasty tendency to 
repeat itself.

You know, I believe I said as much in the next paragraph, which you 
didn\'t quote.

[snippage...]

What I meant to illustrate was the difference in scale between the two 
game systems, which I feel I managed effectively.  I am probably at least 
as guilty of getting the terms \'strategic\' and \'tactical\' wrong as the 
guy who asked the original question, which inferred that one game system 
was \'strategic,\' while the other was \'tactical.\'  I hope that you can 
forgive me for that.

For the rest of you reading this:  The above paragraph I quoted (that 
Craig Berry wrote) describing the terms \'strategic\' and \'tactical\' is 
correct, and you ought to refer to it if these terms confuse you.

It\'s hard to say, really.  All I ever used were the encounter tables in 
the TNE rulebook and the "Vampire Fleets" sourcebook.  Picking up BR 
won\'t give you any insight on how TNE designed large ships; they were all 
designed using the FF&S system.  What BR does is take the FF&S stats and 
cooks them down into a format that allows them to be used with its 
simplified combat system.  There\'s been some previous discussion on what 
tonnage ranges constituted battleships, cruisers, and whatnot (and these 
figures will vary between Milieus, as the recent discussions on Sylean 
warships bears out).  Ballpark figures (my own guesses) have battleships 
weighing in over 100,000 tons or so, cruisers filling the gap between 
about 10,000 tons and 100,000 tons, and frigates, corvettes and 
destroyers being 10,000 tons or less.  Carriers, I suppose, could be any 
damn size they wanted to be.

I\'ve said it before, and I\'ll say it again:  If both sides had the full 
benefit of canonical (there\'s that word again!) information on the Virus 
phenomenon as presented in "Survival Margin," there\'d be a lot less 
discussion on the subject.  People on both sides of the debate are guilty 
of using "facts" not supported by that document.

Oh, crud!  We\'re starting to agree on things!  Can it be that some 
rationality is finally starting to creep into the discussion, or could it 
be that there is actually some common ground (*gasp!*) between the Pro- 
and Anti-Virus camps?  I shudder to think...

So, how \'bout them rocks?

True as far as it goes.  But how many Real World nuclear powered
submarines are owned and operated by a disreputable bunch of
traders, wheelers and dealers?  How many Real World nuclear
powered subs could be owned and run by someone who stole
it or is skipping out on their ship financing payments?

The great difference between fission powered transport in the
world today, and fission powered transport in Traveller, is that
as far as I know today all such craft are in the control of the
military.  In Traveller they are in the control of a motley assortment
of weirdos and criminals, not to mention all the NPC\'s.  Do you
really think that military standards of maintenance and safety
will be adhered to?  I think it was Merrick who wrote in an
earlier post on this topic that the greatest problem with nuclear
safety is people, rather than technology.  I don\'t think that you
can really divorce the two as technology does not exist in a
vacuum, but as a tool or tools used by people.  History shows
that people unfortunately have a tendency to take short cuts
where safety is concerned, particularly where those short-cuts
lead to a financial saving.  As an example, look at the
decommissioned Russian nuclear subs slowly rusting away
in Vladivostok harbour.

I could certainly imagine many worlds wanting to take great
care that any ship being flown over their city which had a
fission reactor sitting in the middle of it met pretty rigorous
standards of inspection and safety, which of course, they would
need to enforce.  If those ships were piloted by  the average
group of PC\'s, I should imagine that a VERY close inspection
would be made.  If the reactor was not being adequately
maintained (or the PC\'s failed to bribe the inspectors/
inadvertently insulted them etc) the ship would be grounded.

Galanglic remained broadly the same over the period of the Long Night,
with the exception of a few bizarre shifts in meaning.  One of which was the
surprising shift which meant the pre-Long Night phrase \'Press for
Self-Destruct\' became transliterated as \'Coffee White, no Sugar\'. Of
course, surprisingly few Syleans knew that...

No Visio does not export to other formats. But, yes, I just exported a

supports full OLE embedding. I use it in my work documents all the

are all embedded in Word or Ami Pro documents.

Checked out the reverse. Corel will also export to Visio. So at least
between these two products, there is compatibility. Corel objects will
UNGROUP in Visio, so cross usage is possible.

I use Corel when I need to add that autistic touch. :)  I also use
Corel 3 at home. I would be willing to swap my Corel symbology for

Are there any other drawing program formats that poeple are using?

with Margret Weis as part of a working holladay). His comments about 
traveller as well as his work with Margret on the Mag Force 7 books.

1. I asked him about the high tech in Traveller, pointing out the 
apparent technophobia in the Imperium around 1100. He replied that things 
like robots and other super advanced technolagy is possable but not 
economicly viable. Given the view that the massed labor pool of 
the Imperium makes better economic sence that high scale robotic 
manufacturing. He feels however that Imperium at Year 0 is about 
embracing the new technolagy of Fusion+, thruster plates et al. 

2. Skills. He mentioned that stats WILL play a part in skill resolution, 
unlike CT where combat was roll 8+, no matter if you where Arnie or 
Barnie (my words not his :-) ). He did state that the skill resolution 
will not be as convoluted as MegaTraveller.

3. QSDS/SSDS. He is quite happy the way this has turned out, especially 
when I mentioned that I am no gearhead and lothed FFS/MegaTraveller 
construvction rules. He also likes Stu Golden\'s comabat rules to go with 
these system design rules. He feels that Guy\'s QSDS will be appreciated 
by smucks like me.

4. Mail. When I gloated about the size of his mailbox when he goes back 
to the US, he gloated in turn. Apparently Margret\'s daughter goes through 
the e-mail at home (she is here in OZ too). At one stage he was getting 
150+ mail PLUS the Trav and GDW-beta list in digest form. 

5. The meeting of ImperialGames that Marc Miller mentioned has seemed to 
set the ground rules for T4. Don mentioned that some cannon might be 
changed, especially the TNE stuff. Virus may be on this hit list, as he 
mentioned that Virus limited the potential of a possable Millue 1200 body 
of work. This was the problem for FFS, as it was scewered towards 
post-Virus. Any FFS2 will be more Impirial centric. 

6. Don was fun to talk to (As was Margret , but that is not too relevent 
here worst luck). I had problems forgetting that Don is from Canada, so 
when I and others translated things into Miles and Farenhight, he had to 
remind us that he too uses a sensible scale of mesurement (apparently he 
drives a car with a km\'s speedomiter, and his Yank friends keep pointing 
to it and say "Your going 100?!?!" He loved our winter (sunny and about 
10-15 deg celcius), plugged his game store "The Game Guild - Lake Geneva 
HTTP://www.mag7.com" He is excited by T4, and his excitement was 
contagous. 

If you are an aussie, He will be going to conventions at Canberra and 
Melbourne, and is here for two weeks. Go talk to him, it is worth the 
admission fee (the book signing I went too was free [#smirk])

Crew Detail: 9 Engineers, 2 Electronics, 1 Astrogator, 1 Pilot, 0 Gunnery, 20 
Screens, 16 Small Craft Crew, 10 Command, 13 Medic, 41 Steward, 10 troops.
Notes:  The Luv Boat, err, Luxury Heighliner has TL12 AdvancedCommo, and a TL12 
50-ton capacity fuel purifier.  There are 650 small stateroms, 210 large 
staterooms and 100 low berths.  The small and large staterooms devoted to 
passengers (500 and 200 repectively) are 10% larger than normal.  The hull is a 
Streamlined Cylinder.  The ship carries four 50-ton Modular Cutters in minimal 
hangars, as well as a 100-ton shuttle in a streamlined dorsal grapple.  The 10 
shipboard troops act as an onboard police and security force.  In theory, the 
ship can carry up to 110 tons cargo, but in reality 60 tons are taken up by a 
large swimming pool, a theatre/auditorium and an elaborate banquet hall.  The 
ship has 20 sandcaster turrets, as well as 20 empty sockets.  There is 
sufficient power to operate 20 civilian laser (the TL12 26MW units), and 
sufficient empty crew staterooms to absorb the 20 extra gunners and 1 command 
person this mod would create.

The ship\'s crew are divided into several divisions

* The Command Division, headed by Captain Crystal.  This division includes the 
pilot and astrogator, as well as the electronics staff and the flight crews of 
the ship\'s boats.  Most of the administrative tasks of managing the ship are 
handled by the competent Chief Purser, Lt. Hedgehog.  Cptn. Crystal seems to 
spend most of his time inviting unattached young ladies and married couples 
with relationship problems to dine at his table, and wandering the decks during 
exercise period.

* The Engineering Division, headed by a man nobody really recalls having ever 
seen.  He is rumored to be a gruff but jolly old Scotsman.  In fact, as far as 
anyone can remember, no passenger or command crewman has ever even seen the 
engines, let alone an engineer.  Since the ship has been successfully plying 
the space lanes for almost 20 years, there are almost certainly engines on the 
ship.

* The Medical Division, headed by the appropriately-named Doc.  There are 
_officially_ 12 other staff in Doc\'s division, but the only medic ever seen on 
the ship is Doc.  It is suspected that the other medical crew are quartered 
with the engineers.

* The Hospitality Division, headed by the ever-cheery Juli.  This division 
includes the stewards, bartenders and aerobics instructors, without whom the 
ship would certainly flounder.  Juli is greatly aided in her duties by Yitzhak, 
the amusing yet wise token ethnic of the crew, whose wry humor and wisdom serve 
to solve many quarrels in his bar, yet consistently fail to get him into a 
meaningful relationship with a sophont of the opposite sex.

* The Security Division, headed by the somewhat gung-ho Lt. Krieger.  This 
division includes the sandcaster operators, and would include the gunners if 
they were on board.  Much like the engineering crew, the security forces have 
really never been seen before, but when the occasional piece of jewellry is 
stolen Lt. Krieger is the man responsible for finding the culprit.  For some 
odd reason, he has never actually succeeded; nearly every such minor crime (the 
only kinds of crime allowed on the Luv Boat) are solved by Juli, Hedgehog or 
Yitzhak.  This may be caused by the hiding away of the security personnell in 
the engineering spaces with the engineers and other medics.

Iain Banks style Orbitals:

from: http://www.sys.uea.ac.uk/~u9323899/cs/shock.html

"Perhaps the easiest way to envisage an Orbital is to compare it to the
idea that inspired it (this sounds better than saying; Here\'s where I
stole it from).  If you know what a Ringworld is - invented by Larry
Niven; a segment of a Dyson Sphere - then just discard the shadow-squares,
shrink the whole thing till it\'s about three million kilometres across,
and place in orbit around a suitable star, tilted just off the ecliptic;
spin it to produce one gravity and that gives you an automatic 24-hour
day-night cycle (roughly; the Culture\'s day is actually a bit longer).  An
elliptical orbit provides seasons. 
   
Of course, the materials used in the construction of something ten million
kilometres in circumference spinning once every 24 hours are far beyond
anything we can realistically imagine now, and it is quite possible that
the physical constraints imposed by the strength of atomic bonds ensure
that such structures will prove impossible to construct, but if it is
possible to build on a such a scale and subject such structures to forces
of these magnitudes, then I\'d submit that there is an elegance in using
the same rotation to produce both an acceptable day-night cycle and an
apparent gravity which makes the idea intrinsically attractive." 

If the orbital has a circumference of 10 million km and with a width of
20,000 km you end up with a surface area 400 times that of earth.

See _Consider Phlebas_ or _Player of Games_ for more information.

It seems likely that it might even be possible to create an orbital using
TL 15 technology and a bonded superdense "hull".

Bruce,

I normally avoid making public, negative comments about upcoming products 
(meaing, things I know nothing about), but you\'ve brought some questions 
to the public arena which have also been bothering me.

On the one hand:

1)  Hey, it\'s not my money on the line (other than the $ for copies of the 
initial books).  If IG fails, those folks (and Marc Miller) are gonna be a 
lot more upset about it than I will be.

2)  I\'m not an insider to this project.  It could be the greatest RPG of 
all time.


But on the other hand:

1)  I have a lot of time, energy, and (face it) emotion invested in 
Traveller.  I want this product to be a smashing success so bad I can 
taste it (sick, isn\'t it?).  

2)  I /did/ jump the gun a bit and order a bunch of Traveller stuff sight 
unseen.  Two copies of the Traveller hardback.  Starships.  JTAS.  
Citizens of the Imperium (haven\'t belonged to a fan club since the early 
Atari 2600/VCS days, but what the H*ll).  I\'m not wealthy, and 
expenditures like that aren\'t made lightly.

3)  If T4 is a failure, it will probably change these lists that I love 
beyond recognition.  I enjoy our discussions, and I look forward to all 
the wonderful new things we will be able to discuss and create together 
using the new system...if it doesn\'t fail.


So....

I hope the answer to your questions is "Yes, we did a lot of playtesting 
of all the systems.  We hired three great, professional proofreaders, and 
we are certain there are no errors in the book.  This will /not/ be a 
repeat of the MT and TNE initial product releases."  

But, somehow, I doubt it.

Please, IG, prove me wrong.  Show me what a negativistic b*stard I am.  
It\'ll be the first time I\'ve ever happily been fed my own words.

Anyway, like the man said about the possibility of life after death, 
"There is no conclusive evidince for it.  There is no conclusive evidence 
against it.  Soon enough, you will know. So why fret about it?"

Oh, man. "Nightmare" is right!  :)  

Seriously, when I started reading the details and realized the show it 
was inspired by, I had to share it with my wife.  As I read it to her, I 
had to stop several times as we were both caught by laughing fits.  That 
was really great.

Then again, I\'d rather not find myself running ANY of the crewmembers as 
my character. :)

I grant you this...but then again to use a 20th century Terran model, 
you\'d best have a squeaky clean background to get a car loan...let 
alone a VERY large business loan, which essentially is what is a 
starship loan would be...

Actually though, with the nature of Interstellar communications, peer 
pressure is going to be less on an interstellar scale...  On the 
other hand, the need for a good reputation in local circles is going 
to be even more crucial...

Actually, any loan officer worth the salary should be able to do this

terms...

I don\'t think you could curtail the loan that easily once it 
happened...  

On the other hand I could definitely see the Imperium pressuring the

Subj:  First Contact
Date:  96-07-30 22:41:22 EDT
From:  KenRoney

At last, I\'ve found you guys. It took a while, but I\'ve
finally read up on all the postings. As somebody who
got his first taste of TRAVELLER fumbling around
on the Kinunir back in 1105 and fighting off bat-
thingies in the pre-Judges Guild days, I\'d like to add
my two credits worth to the on-going discussion.

* I think it\'s great that Imperium Games is going to
support TRAVELLER. But remember, for them, it
has to be a business, no profit, no more cool stuff for
us. They appear to be trying to restart the game
right. That\'ll be good for all of us. Wait and see the
end results before you start complaining about the
details.

* In regards to concern about the rules, I don\'t see
where all the emotion is coming from. In my
experience, the best TRAVELLER ref\'s take the
closing statements in the old Book 3 to heart.
Essentially, do what will make a better game for you
and your players. The rules systems are just a guide.
If you don\'t like the latest incarnation, use what
you\'re familiar with. It\'s a game! Have fun.

* When I heard that GDW went under, I didn\'t
worry about how I could run my campaign, I looked
at the bright side, now I could send TNE in whatever
way I needed it. Damn the support materials, full
speed ahead. Accept the fact that for a while we\'ll all
have to rely more on our own imagination and
creativity. If you weren\'t there, it\'ll be just like the
good ol\' days.

* Remember, TRAVELLER is being reborn, I think
that we\'re in for an exciting period of growth and
development. Give Miller and the Imperium Games
folks a chance to try a different vision. I for one do
not want a rehash of old stuff, and we really do need
to make TRAVELLER more accessible to newer,
younger players.

*And last , if you haven\'t already done it, Noah, pop
a fast drug dude. We both know you\'ll buy the new
books and love them. And I\'ll get that "101 Robots"
to you real soon, I promise, really.

Thanks for hearing me out.

Ken

I\'m reading a book now that might have some bearing on Mileux Zerox...

Charles Sheffield: Godspeed (Tor, $4.99, ISBN 0-812-51992-2, 11/94)

Normally when a Charles Sheffield book comes out, I read it right away.
However, given my wacky work schedule, I\'ve been falling behind. But, this
one is worth seeking out. It is a young adult book (in writing, main
character is a teenager, etc.), but a lot of fun. Basically a reworking of
such classics as Treasure Island or Kidnapped, it\'s the story (of a man
called Brady--now stop that Fred! Only 17 days till vacation, hang in there!)
of a world called Erin, in a system with "40 Worlds" (most of which are
asteroids). Erin has been cut off from the rest of the universe by the
complete shutdown of arriving FTL ships (using something called "The Godspeed
Drive"). This happened several generations ago, and people have been
surviving on aging technology since then.

Jay Hara\'s mother often entertains spacers. She also boards them in their
house on the lake. One day, a spacer named Paddy shows up for an extended
stay. Paddy only lacks a peg leg and a parrot to make him your typical
"Kidnapped"-era mysterious gent. Jay learns that Paddy is seeking a place
called "Paddy\'s Fortune", hinted at to be the source of fortune in the form
of old technology--including--perhaps--the Godspeed drive.

Could make a good source for a Traveller 4 adventure. Another book that
springs to mind (in addition to the excellent Andre Norton stuff recommended
recently) is Jerry Pournelle\'s A Spaceship for the King/King David\'s
Spaceship (appeared under both titles). This is set in the Empire universe of
The Mote in God\'s Eye, at roughly the same time as that book. The setting of
the book is a planet recently rediscovered by the Empire. It seems that you
can get into the Empire in two ways: If you don\'t have space travel, you are
under some sort of second class status (hey, I read the book a looooonnnggg
time ago!). If you have space travel--however rudimentary--you enter as a
equal. The main characters set out to give the planet space travel only
slightly better than a Jules Verne cannon! I wonder if J. Cambias\' "Space
Race" (Challenge #?) was at all inspired by this book...

Check out Niven\'s essay "Larger than Worlds". One of the more
interesting items is the "Alderson Disk". This is a *huge* flat disk.
Think of an LP record so big the that the sun fits into the hole...

You get real gravity if you make it a few thousand km thick. How you
keep it from collapsing along the plane is where the hand waving comes
in. 

Since it will extend from (say) Mercury\'s orbit to well past Pluto,
there\'s room for a *lot* of environments. You can vary gravity to some
extent by making the disk thicker or thinner.

The disk is so massive that the sun will "orbit" it, instead of the
other way around. The "orbit" will amount to the sun bobbing up and
down thru the hole.

Except in the regions *very* close to the hole, the sun will never rise
that far above the horizon, and it\'ll get rather dark while it\'s
illuminating the other side of the disk.

As Niven commented, a very spooky place.

1.	THE RINGWORLD

Charles Collin asked:
>Oh, and one more thing (How Columbo-esque!): could someone please explain
to me the spill mountains introduced in the Ringworld Engineers? 

A high school science class came up with these. You see, the Ringworld 
still has erosion. If left to continue, all the aggregate material (ie. 
Soil, etc) would eventually end up in the bottom of the two big seas on 
the ring. What Niven added is a kind of underwater dredge that pushes 
sediment into pipes. These pipes connect the ocean floor with the spill 
mountains (running in/under the scrith). Sediment thus circulates from 
the sea floor to the spill mountains, then (via erosion) back to the sea 
floor again.

As to instability, Niven put in _two_ big oceans in order to balance each 
other out. The instability is a product of the design of the Ringworld, 
and the necessary stabilisation is provided by the rim-mounted ramscoops, 
not by the spill mountains.

The Ringworld\'s problem was that people on the surface dismounted 95% of 
the ramscoops, to use them in sub-light ships. This left only a minimal 
number able to correct instabilities.

2.	HAZARD SYMBOLS

Steve Bonneville said:

>Characters who operate starships involved in trading should be able to
read this stuff -- heck, their LHyd tanks are probably marked with it or
the Imperial equivalent. 

The Universal Hazard Profile is detailed in _Challenge #31_. A program to 
randomly create a hazardous cargo is available on the Web.

Well, I proof-read it. Not the professional proof-reading that is, Ken told
me they had someone else in to do that. I _did_ go through it with a
tooth-pick (ask Matt Machtan about all the little grammar and spelling
corrections I sent in).

I reviewed the rules system some time back (see the BITS [British Isles
Traveller Support] newsletter on http://www.wlihe.ac.uk/~Ward/bits.html).
The rules I proof-read were slightly different and appeared to have the
attribute points pool stuff missing. There were a few glaring rules goofs
and inconsistencies but I pointed all these out to IG and they said they\'d
either fixed them already or would do so now I\'d found them.

I would hope that the new rules are going to appeal to both old-timer and
newbie alike. Old-timers will moan a bit about not having "to the nearest
millimetre penetration with my uranium-tipped hollow-point explosive
armour-piercing ballistic capped slugs" but I believe a lot more of that
sort of detail will be returning in FF&S part 75 or whatever. Then there
will be the "roll LOW for success? Hey, I thought this was Traveller? What,
not TNE\'s d20... but we do still use d6? Ok let\'s run through this one more
time...".

However, meanwhile hopefully millions of newbies will be finding that the
rules system is sufficiently innovative but easy to use with a spanking hot
background that allows them to run any era and any type of game (there\'s
quite a bit of text in the book about how the ref\' should run the game, get
ideas, adapt, etc.)

There are things I\'d have liked to see in the rule book, but like all
things, if you waited until you\'d put in everything you want, the rule book
would be larger than TNE\'s, would cost $200 and would be due for retail in
2007. What, you\'d like to wait that long and pay that much? Hey, some of you
need your brains examined!

Anyway, I\'m positive about this (play-test? Yes, I\'ve play-tested the new
tasks system and once the players got used to it they liked it. NOT as easy
as I\'d like to convert players from previous eras though as the use of
attributes (ala TNE) means people who used to be Gun Combat 5 but have a
lousy Dex might now be worse than someone with Gun 1 and a Dex of 13.

It\'s a mere month to wait - the important thing now is to pester your games
store to stock Traveller stuff as it comes out. Particularly, tell them to
stock wonderful adventures such as "The Long Way Home" - due out fairly soon
(God willing) from BITS and to be published in the UK by BITS and in the US
by Sword of the Knight (Traveller Chronicle) - It\'s the first officially
approved Milieu 0 campaign adventure and it\'s HOT!!!!

In summary, the rule book should be useful to oldies and good news for
newbies. If you don\'t like particular bits, don\'t yell at me, yell at IG and
(given the way they\'ve responded so far to us for QSDS, etc.) they might do
something about it!

it recycled? I\'ve noticed a distinct lack of starships that look anything

They do look pretty. They just don\'t look like Traveller ships I\'m familiar

I\'m not sure that a period of reflection was needed so much as a long-enough
time in order to produce a quality product.  Given the great rush and nearly
nonexistant playtesting for QSDS, I\'m suprised that it has as few errors as
it does (there are currently two known errors in QSDS).  However, with only
a couple or three more weeks for playesting, there could have been zero!
In addition, the QSDS design rules were never tested (at least, not by me or
any of the design-testers of QSDS) with the space combat rules for T4.

What I\'m most afraid of in T4 is that it will prove to have enough errors
and mis-matches due to the rushed schedule that it will not sell well.  This
was, IMHO, an error that GDW made over and over again - particularly in the
Traveller line since MegaTraveller, and in all of the company\'s product
lines towards the end.

Agreed.  IMHO, 2300AD never recovered from Traveller:2300.  Had the
materials which were printed under the "2300AD" title been the initial
realease, I believe the game would have sold well.  However, initially
marketing it under the "Traveller" name probably turned off many potential
customers (the folks who would be interested in an SF game, but didn\'t want
to play Traveller) and turned many of the purchasers against it (people who
were expecting Traveller materials set in 2300AD/Rule of Man era).

I can\'t figure this one either - I like the game, and have a lot of the
materials published for it.  HOWEVER, I can think of two things that may
have contributed to the failure of Space:1889.
1) A lot of the younger crowd couldn\'t "get into" Space:1889 at all.  They\'d
   gotten interested in Science Fiction through BattleStar Galactica and
   Star Wars and Star Trek.  Only the older folks (those of us who are now
   over 30) had read Verne and Burroughs.
2) Although I have a lot of the Space:1889 material, when the game came out
   I refused to buy it.  It was expensive, and I\'d just gotten burned by
   MegaTraveller - MT was so error-ridden that it was impossible to use, and
   I felt quite ripped off.  So I refused to buy any GDW products.
   Even now, every last Space:1889 product I own has been acquired
   secondhand; I didn\'t buy any new GDW products from MegaTraveller to
   T:TNE.

Poor timing.  When it was released, Dark Conspiracy was just another
"me-too" dark future game [*].  By the time X-files came along, Dark
Consipracy was already old news.  Had Dark Conspiracy been released later,
perhaps in the beginning of the second season of X-files, it probably would
have been a hit.

I don\'t know who owns Dark Conspiracy now, but they just might want to talk
to Fox TV about a licencing deal.  A re-written and re-released Dark
Conspiracy might just make a good "Official X-Files RPG".

> 	And yet all these games _did_ fail.  Why?

Several reasons:
1) GDW was (almost) always short on cash.  This means they didn\'t have the
   money, or the luxury of the time, to do the product "right".  Admittedly,
   no matter how much time or money you have, compromises have to be made.
   IMHO, GDW had to compromise too much, too often.
2) Lack of playtesting and copy-editing.  This is partly-related to the
   first, and partly not.  Playtesting doesn\'t have to cost money, just
   time (and not even much of that).  At least one review I have read
   describes a product as "typical" for GDW: a great idea crippled by errors
   and lack of playtesting.
3) Amazingly poor sense of timing.  About the only two times I can think of 
   that GDW managed to ship a product that was exactly what was needed,
   and just in time, were original Traveller, and the Desert Shield Fact Book.
4) Some bad business decisions: Space:1889 (while a great idea) aparrently
   didn\'t reach the correct audience.  And I _still_ haven\'t been able to
   figure out why anybody in the RPG industry would have anything to do
   with a Gary Gygax product.


> More importantly, why will T4 be any different?

Maybe.  As far as I can tell, the only GDW mistake that IG is making is the
rush-job-and-lack-of-playesting one.  Of course, if IG is unlucky, this
could be all it takes; if they\'re lucky, they\'ll get away with it this
time.  IMHO, IG shouldn\'t be trusting to luck.

> I sincerely hope that the folks at Imperium Games have
> this one figured out, because one way or another, there _won\'t_ be a T5. 

Wether or not there\'s a T5, I feel very strongly that there\'s a "niche" in
the RPG market for a Traveller-like RPG.  And if it isn\'t filled by
Traveller, it\'ll be filled by something.  GURPS Space seems to be the
reigning champion ... it\'s what most of the people I know bought
when we got disgusted with first-edition MegaTraveller; many proceeded to
play in the Traveller background with the GURPS rules.

I must confess that a lot of my money that would otherwise have gone to GDW
went to Steve Jackson Games instead.  Of the four problems I cite above, I
can\'t think of any that consistently apply to SJG.  As I\'ve said here
before, the publishers of Traveller (no matter what era and edition) could
do a lot worse than to emulate Steve Jackson\'s company in those areas.

I think GDW also confused the vendors with that title. The owner of the
store from which I bought Traveller:2300 told me that GDW had phased
out Traveller and that Traveller:2300 was the *replacement* for Traveller.
I purchased a copy, expecting something set in the Solomani Rim, but
what I got was something totally different. The box is sitting in a closet at
home, never played. Scratch that. We did play it once, for one evening.

Well, I think that what IG is trying to do is create a new look for
Traveller at Year 0.  In 1000 years we can expect the ships we love to
look the way they do.

Anecdote:  I remember when I first got "The Flaming Eye" and I saw the
deck plans for the Garu 200-ton Far Trader.  Much classier looking than
the Empress Marava.  It looked similar, but sleeker, cooler.  I think
that\'s the first time it really occured to me that the same ship (USP)
could look different without being funtionally so.  And trust me,
sometimes the way something appears has much more to say about it than
the numbers behind it.

Oh thank God!  I was afraid I was the only total fanboy around here who did 
things like that.  I plan on using the dogtags to frighten people once I\'ve 
almost convinced them that RPGs are not a bad thing.  Of course, _I_ still have 
my original GI Joe Club dogtags from 1969.

I\'ve been thinking about this issue a lot since Bruce first brought it up (and 
even earlier, when I was submitting and resubmitting ship designs).  I really 
HOPE the rules set is solid.  I have a strong suspiscion that the starship 
combat portion will be the weakest part, and will probably be the second thing 
I toss from my own campaign (the first thing being range bands.  _Range Bands_, 
for heavens sake!  I have never played Traveller with a group that did not 
ditch range bands as soon as the playing started.

I am looking at this a bit more philosophically.  There were two sections of 
the original 3-book rules that were basically lame, and that I quickly replaced 
with my own systems; personal combat and starship combat.  In both cases, GDW 
later came out with a better system that I adopted (Azhanti High Lightning and 
High Guard, respectively).  I know for a fact there is a plan to come out with 
advnaced (presumably better) starship rules later.  I strongly suspect that the 
combat rules will either be something I can modify to suit my needs, or that 
Imperium Games will come out with a compatible but better system later (perhaps 
in JTAS).  If it comes right down to it, I\'ll cook up my own system and submit 
that to JTAS.

I\'m like Joe in this; I want IG to succeed so bad it hurts.  I was looking 
through some old Space Gamer issues over the weekend (garage cleaning day - I\'m 
keeping the magazines).  One thing that really struck me was the fact that 
EVERY issue had one, two or even more Traveller articles.  There were other 
gaming magazines in the pile also, ones I did not subscribe to but bought 
individually, and all of them had Traveller stuff also.  This was a very 
respectable stack; maybe 100 magazines in all.  For whatever reason, that level 
of fan commitment stopped, and I truly think that more than anything else 
_that_ is what killed GDW\'s Traveller.

So, I have made my own personal pledge.  Starting this week, I intend to submit 
something once per month to JTAS.  In fact, I already made this month\'s 
submission; mailed it yesterday.  Rob Miracle says we have more than 500 TML 
members.  If only 10% of you do the same thing, IG will be getting 50 
submissions per month.  Even if they only accept 10% of what is submitted, 
there would be 10 JTAS articles by TML members in every bimonthly issue.  Look 
at some of the _REALLY_ cool stuff that hits the TML.  The RICE Papers.  The 
ship designs.  The adventure ideas.  Even some of the "throwaway" comments like 
the one a few months back about the fate of Lucan - forced to live forever by 
his robotic servants and tortured with undying agony.  Even some the technical a
rguments that show up here could make good material; the infamous RockDropper 
thread, summarized into a 4-page article, would provide a wealth of information 
for players and GMs.  The bio-warfare stuff Bruce Johnson did.  The 
Majesta-class ship and background history (was that Alvin Plummer?).  And so on.

Look at the Imperium Games website for submission information.  I think Andy 
Lilly\'s BITS site has the information as well.  If you are not web-capable, 
write to IG and JTAS to get submission information.  Hey, if you\'re really 
ambitious, ask them for guidelines for submitting an entire adventure or 
supplement.  And remember also that IG and JTAS are not the only fish in the 
sea.  To really make Traveller thrive we need to get it exposed in some of the 
"general-purpose" gaming magazines.  I know Dragon is now a TSR-only organ, but 
what about some of the others.  And of course, there are a lot of really good 
"indie" Traveller magazines out there; Traveller material in those magazines 
might be "preaching to the choir" in terms of expanding Traveller\'s popularity, 
but support of any kind is what makes games grow.

OK, I\'ll get down off my pulpit now.  I just want the new Trav to stay around, 
grow tremendously and piss off TSR and people like Phil Pugliese.  I want it to 
be something we can both enjoy and participate in.  Think of this as something 
like an election:  If You Don\'t Vote (or write), Don\'t Bitch

	No, insurance would have to be part of the deal...I\'m paying for it 
with my mortgage payment.  The same goes for a new car...you gotta 
have full replacement coverage as a condition of getting the loan.

	Since nothing\'s over \'till the fat lady signs the contract, yes it 
is very easy for the lending authority to drop the loan.  Even after 
it\'s been signed, most mortgages have a clause that states to the 
effect of: "If the borrower (henceforth known as the \'screwee\') lied 
or omitted relevant information on the loan application or at any 
time during the closing, the lender (henceforth known as...well you 
get it)  can foreclose in a hearbeat.

	I don\'t think the Imperium would actually have any problem with a 
\'Fed Ex\' type service...the majority of people who could afford such services are 
probably within the power circle of the Imperium, anyway.

	Remember, FedEx doesn\'t, strictly speaking, employ really advanced 
technology, just a BIG fleet of aircraft and trucks, and a 
state-of-the-art package handling system.

	The USPS could easily match FedEx\'s speed; it\'s just that
first-class mail wouldn\'t cost no 32 cents an ounce, but about
$2.95, they wouldn\'t cruise the entire city every day dropping off
and picking up packages,  and there would be about a 25%-50% increase in 
air traffic (anyone know how much mail is trucked point to point vs. 
flown?)

	A PC group running even a moderately sized J6 courier service would 
probably get less static from the Imperium than contracts...they\'d be 
simply co-opted into the system. I\'d suspect that a basic Imperial

   Yes, Marc Miller conducted testing with some people outside the
IG organization, finding out what they did and did not like.  As I was not
made privy to the results, I can only report they did take place, no names,
etc.  My source is MM himself, who mentioned the testing in passing in
a post to the Traveller thread on AOL\'s Game Designer\'s Forum.

   The longer you wait, the more you lose name recognition.  Also, as
people sit around with their collection of Traveller products and no
support asking, ``now what?``, they are tempted into other game
systems that have official support and new products being released.
I think that MM did the right thing by moving quickly to salvage what was
left of the potential customer base.

   And for God sake, invest money in advertising.  Consumers didn\'t
know they needed Coca-Cola or Pepsi until they were convinced they
needed it by advertisements.  Why is Dragon Dice a hot game?  Because
TSR tells you it is (forget the fact that it is basically glorified Craps).  IG
would do well to spend money in this area.  GDW may have went out of
business at basically break even (I won\'t bring up the Freelance Issue,
it is a moot point now), but one wonders how much better TNE would
have sold if the ads for it appeared in something other than the house
magazine and the backs of other GDW products.

>A lot of people have criticized TNE as being "T:2000 in space," but

   Excellent point.  I think sometimes people get a bit too
``Travellercentric`` (now there\'s a new word) in their thinking when it
comes to analyzing the ways and whats of GDW\'s business strategy
and eventual downfall.

   That the RC has its fans is without question, but the majority of the fan
base was clearly looking for something else--probably set in the
Spinward Marches--when ``the next Traveller`` came out in 1993.
More people were turned off by the RC setting than were turned on.

>But TNE still was not enough  to keep GDW afloat.

   TNE did not kill GDW, nor did the end of the Cold War, the unfortunate
choices they made with regard to what games to develop, the law suit
by TSR, CCGs, or the departure of Dave Nilsen.  All these things
to one degree or another *may* or *may not* have contributed to GDW\'s
death (each point is debatable).  Like the destruction of the Roman
Empire, the story of how we get to the fall of Rome in 476 or
Constantinople in 1453 is much more complex than can be summed up in
a single cause or reason (though historians occasionally still try).

>And yet all these games _did_ fail.  Why?  

   As with the story of GDW, there were a variety of factors involved.

>More importantly, why will T4 be any different?  

   It may very well not be.  We are talking about a company (IG) which
does not have a monopoly or even a government subsidy trying to sell
something that is not a necessary household item, and is usually
purchased out of the disposable income of men and boys ages 16 to 34.
While this niche is a lucrative one that can support a great number
of players, competition is fierce,  and considering that IG starts off with
no market share (only a lot of former customers), the odds are against
them.

   Now before everyone goes off to sulk, also be aware that Marc Miller
appears to have a flair for business, that IG has been very
customer-oriented (thus far), and that companies with less going for
them than IG does have went on to become highly successful.  The story
of the Wizards of the Coast (the people who created those evil Magic
cards), is but one example.  They went from being a two-bit fantasy RPG
company to being one of the major players in the industry virtually
overnight.  So while the odds may be against IG, it doesn\'t mean that
they won\'t enjoy success, perhaps a degree of success beyond what
GDW was able to achieve in it heyday.

>As the above list shows, it is not enough to have a good idea, the idea
>has to sell games.  

   Exactly.  Success as failure has many reasons behind it, and if
everything is aligned properly, IG will do well.

>By the fact that T4 is being marketed as "Marc Miller\'s Traveller" and as

   At least initially they have to--remember what I said above, right now
they have **no** market share, only a lot of former customers. 
Converting former GDW customers into part of the IG customer base
takes catch phrases and words that will draw us in.  The mere mention
of MM\'s name causes many a pre-1987 Traveller fan to snap to attention
and present wallet, so IG features his name before even getting around
to telling you the name of the game.  The choice of ``Marc Miller\'s
Traveller`` also alerts people who were not thrill with TNE (OK, think it
sucks) that what they are looking at is *not* that version of the game,
but a new one that harkens back to the original.

   Something else to consider: IG realizes that those pre-1987 Traveller
fans (age 27 and up by my reckoning) have more disposable income
than your typical 16-26 year old.  That\'s explains why they got Marc sign
some hard copy editions and then offered them for sale at $10 extra
(yes, I\'m guilty of buying one--they nailed my demographic and buying
habits--how could I resist?).  They aren\'t trying to sell those to some
17 year old high school senior.

   The next step in their plan is almost certainly to capture the 16-26 year
olds, and expand the customer base.  My theory is that\'s what the Year
Zero setting is suppose to do.  Keep your fingers crossed....

>I sincerely hope that the folks at Imperium Games have this one figured
>out, because one way or another, there _won\'t_ be a T5. 

   I get the feeling they have, and you are correct sir.  If this version of
Traveller doesn\'t work out, it will almost certainly be the last.

Yep, me too.  Not the T-shirt though. " You\'ve got so many T-shirts, and
black doesn\'t look good on you.  Besides, wouldn\'t that $20 be more

Perhaps, but remember Mark had been seperated from GDW and offical
Traveller for several years.  Maybe during that period he *was* reflecting
on the, not failures but, shortcomings of MT and TNE.

Valid concern, given past events and how little we actually *know* about
T4.  Let\'s not rush to judgement here, none of us have actually seen T4. 
It might very well be solid as a brick, given that most of its core is
coming out of CT...we think.  <g>

Let me tell you!  <g> I snapped Traveller:2300 off the game store\'s shelf
as soon as I saw it.."Oh boy!  Now we get to see Earth contacting the 2nd
Imperium, breaking out into the stars, and exploring new
planets"...surprise!  What I got was Tw2k in space. Hey now, I liked Tw2k
and I liked stutterwarp, but this wasn\'t Traveller!  I didn\'t buy any
supplements, and when 2300AD came out I didn\'t buy into that
either...figured it was same thing, different name.  Not so?

I choked on it\'s price!  Wasn\'t it something like $20 for a slim little

Sure, it\'s been filled by CT for 20 years now.  <g> MT was a
modification of CT.  TNE...let\'s not get into that debate again, but it
*did* grow out of the CT/MT background and use CT/MT assumptions. If T4
doesn\'t take off we still have our old black books.  (Whatever happened to
the idea of putting all the old stuff on a CDROM?  And Digest
Group..weren\'t they interested in re-releasing their old material?)

Guilty!  <g> I stole ideas from GRUPS, Aftermath, Space Opera, and made up
my own rules...and I\'ll probably still do that even after T4 is a *big*
success.

your ceiling is 3m (9\'10") or 3.5m (11\'6") high.

I\'ve taken two different routes with this on designing accomodation
spaces on ships.  One is to divide a standard height deck into upper and
lower portions; the other is to use shorter decks.

For instance, on a 1.5m grid, a 2.5m high (about 8\'2") square gives 1 Td
in 2.5 squares (1.5m x 3.75m x 2.5m = 14.06m^3).  This gives 25% more
floor space to play with.  

This can be the full deck height, or the lower portion of a standard (3m
high) deck.  In the latter case, the remaining 0.5m height is allocated
at 12.5 sq/Td for life support, powerplant (part of which would be
distribution), computer, or whatever.

Similarly, on a 2m grid, a square 7/3 m high (about 7\'8", or 2/3 of the
standard 3.5m height) will give 1 Td in 1.5 squares (2m x 3m x 7/3m = 14
m^3).  This is a 50% increase in useable deck space.  Again, this can be
full deck height, or the additional 7/6m will give 1 Td in 3 squares.

Comments:

1	This allows for _somewhat_ taller humans in the future.  Today\'s navy
ships have maybe 7\' overheads, so the above allows for 8" growth.

2	Given that overhead has a significant impact on comfort, increased
height should be a consideration in \'luxury\' accomodations.

3	As with anything else, this will be culture dependent.

4	The concept of shorter decks in living areas and higher ones in
machinery spaces is in keeping with current shipbuilding practice, so
makes sense to at least that extent.

Just what we needed - one more complication! ;-)

        I haven\'t assumed it\'s all open volume. Some portion of the life
support equipment HAS to depend on how many people are using it! So to me,
the volume for life support actually called out by name in the design
process always dealt with things like plumbing, ducting, lights, heating,
etc. But a portion of each accommodation included the actual air purifier,
etc. for the person to be housed therein.

        So for me, a 3.5m interdeck space includes about 0.5 to 0.75m of
"ceiling," containing the deck itself, ductwork, power conduits, network
cables, etc.

As long as the underlying game is solid, I don\'t mind changing a few 
rules here and there to suit me.  Well, okay, I /enjoy/ changing rules to 
suit me. :)  I just don\'t want to re-write the whole game.

We need lots of newbies.  I hope it works.

Heh.  Seriously, there is a point of diminishing returns.  But I don\'t 
think IG gave it enough time for that to be a problem.  They were still 
on the curve where additional time would reap dispraportionate rewards.  
I know for a fact this is the case with the ship design, as Wildstar has 
said so himself ("one more week, and it would have been error free, 
rather than having the three known errors as it does now").

I like this change.  I fully support it, even though I\'m a die-hard CT 
enthusiast.  This change is elegant: simple and effective.  While it 
might be more realistic to do something like skill_level+(attribute/3) or 
somesuch, this way is much easier...and still gets the job done.  As a 
bonus, it makes attributes more important than ever before.

This doesn\'t worry me for myself, as I fully expect to make my own space 
combat system (I like space combat to be waaaay too simple to expect IG 
or anyone else to publish something to my taste).  But, if the space 
combat/ship design systems are incompatible, it might ruin it for newbies 
since many are undoubtedly going to buy the game expecting awesome space 
combat.

Good point. I thought the same thing.  The only difference was the person 
running my local game store knew better and told me so before I wasted my 
money by purchasing something I didn\'t really want.

True, and I can\'t really blame them for that aspect of it.  I doubt 
there\'s much venture capital out there for RPG publishers.

This, however, I can\'t forgive them for.  As a customer, I am very 
concerned about the quality of the products and services I purchase.  
When I pay money for a product as riddled with errors as MT, I\'ll be so 
disgusted I won\'t buy anything else from that company in most cases.  I\'m 
sure many potential customers feel the same way.  

On the one hand, you can say,"Geez, these are RPG\'s.  If the product 
quality is low, no one is going to be killed.  It isn\'t like we\'re making 
airplanes!"

On the other hand, pride of workmanship should require one to make the best 
possible product under the circumstances.  If the circumstances require 
that a product be unacceptably low in quality, it is time to close the 
doors.

No, it doesn\'t have to be perfect.  Everyone makes mistakes.  But if it 
isn\'t something you can be proud of, then don\'t even bother trying to 
sell it.

Yup, the original Traveller was almost as ground-breaking as the original 
D&D.  There won\'t be another one of those, just like there\'ll never be 
another CCG like M:TG (not that I enjoy, or even own, M:TG; it\'s just an 
example of a produt that was so new and /right/ that the success can 
never be repeated).

This may be one reason IG rushed it.  I\'ve read rumors of various sci-fi 
games coming out from other companies in the near future.  It is 
important that IG beat them to the market.  But is it important enough 
that quality should be sacrificed?

    'body' => '  As the former editor of the Space 1889 fanzine, I can point to at least 
three problems that led to the game\'s demise:

1) By far the most important problem was the game system, specifically 
the combat system.  Derived from tabletop miniatures, it required a 
bucketful of six-sided dice to generate very non-linear results.  
Although character generation was quick and easy, the rest of the game 
mechanics just bit the big one.  As a side note, there were no cool guns 
(just late 19th-C weapons, with generic names even).

2) The demographic was skewed to the old end of the spectrum.  Our 
average subscriber was in his late 20s (no women, sorry).  This was due 
in part to the lack of cool Sci-Fi guns, but mostly was related for the 
need to know lots of history.  Castle Falkenstein does a better job of 
adding fantastic elements - in a sense Space 1889 was too historical, and 
demanded too much knowledge on the part of the players.

3) Crappy adventure supplements.  I love the game, don\'t get me wrong, 
and I own everything published for the game, but with perhaps two 
exceptions (Canal Priests of Mars and maybe Sky Galleons of Mars), the 
writting was dull, the scenarios were linear and unimaginative.

  Above all, this game suffered from GDW\'s background as a wargame 
company - clumsy rules, lack of immagination, and a shortage of cool guns.

  So what does this mean for T4 and the future of Traveller?  Well, I 
think the rules are not likely to be a problem, and the cool guns are 
there.  The big question is the quality of the adventure materials - 
while some folks roll their own, a mass-market game needs lots of 
adventure material to keep it going.  The scedule looks good, if things 
stay on track, but I\'ll reserve my judgement until the Millue 0 book 
comes out.

I couldn\'t figure out how to use the d*mned things when I first got 
Traveller.   So, I came up with my own system.  (Meaning, your theory 
holds true in my case.)

Huh.  I agree on the starship combat note, but I love the personal 
combat rules.  They are perfect for the way I like to run combat.  But 
then, I\'m not into detailed combat.  I just want it quick-n-deadly.

I\'ve read a theory that what made the original D&D so great was that it 
was broken.  That is, each group had to puzzle it out for themselves, 
designing rules and whatnot since the game was severely lacking in 
elegance and detail (excusable, since it was the first of its kind).  
Perhaps, as Traveller grew and expanded, the lack of areas for unofficial 
expansion had something to do with declining usage as well as the other 
well-known reasons.

Good points, all.  I\'m certainly willing to submit material once I have

That little?  How does the crew get around up there for repairs and
maintenance?

In most areas I divide the headspace into a ~2.5m ceiling and an ~1m
crawlspace.  The crawlspace contains the conduits, ductwork, cabling,
gravtic modules for the floor above, various equipment, and enough
headspace for someone to crawl around doing repairs and maintenance.  My
Engineers and Techs spend a good bit of time crawling around between decks
in what I call "The Overhead." <g>

In engineering and cargo holes I go with much higher overheads to
accommodate equipment and cargo.  I try to design Cargo holes, for example,
as having 6m ceilings with the 1 meter crawlspace overhead. This gives you
2Td/square in cargo holes.

Hmmm. I hate to pay out money for something as vague as a fan club; but then
I looked at a collectible figures club I\'m a member of and realised I was
paying about the same for that each year. Hmmm. It\'s still a difficult
decision to actually pull out my wallet.

Range bands are in. Yes, I sent in a fairly heavy hint that this was a
retrograde step - I mean even a 12-15 year old can work out that if a gun
has a range of X metres then that\'s Y squares on this floorplan map, etc.

Now frankly, I\'ve never been much of a starship combat man. In my games
getting your ship hit by a big laser isn\'t just a "OOops! There\'s that Man
Drive -1 again! Or Crew -1: ok guys, rolls dice, whoever gets lowest is dead
- - no, no second chance..." Space combat is so deadly (and so EXPENSIVE -
that Man Drive -1 probably just knocked 5-10 MILLION credits of drive off
your ship). Secondly, very few people I\'ve met understand how craft really
move in space (unless they used to play the old "Asteroids" game, of
course!). So all in all, having a notably simple space combat system with a
few range bands isn\'t too bad in my books.

Frankly, I don\'t worry too much about such mechanics anyway - everything is
done for dramatic effect because that\'s what keeps the players interested.

i.e. NOT:

"Hey, I rolled Man Drive -1: you guys can only go half as fast now"

but instead:

"The bad guy\'s laser slices through space - for a fraction of a second the
Violence is Golden (tm)(c)1980-1996 veers away but then there\'s a heavy
crump resounding through the ship <rolls to see exactly where it hit: gets
Man Drive -1>. The Violence lurches, rolls sideways - power plant levels are
fluctuating wildly, internal sensors indicate a drastic pressure loss in the
engineering area, the internal camera shows you molten metal splattered
across the floor with automatic sealant bubbling around a jagged rip in the
aft bulkhead and fire-control sprays starting to obscure the view. Septimus
- - roll a Difficult Pilot roll to regain control." <looks across table at the
15mm deckplans and figures> "By the way, whose figure is that in the
engineering area of the Violence deckplan?" <one player looks particularly
worried - perhaps this is going to be a Crew -1 hit as well!>

Now, none of the above is in any of the rules, whether you\'re looking at CT,
MT, TNE or the new Traveller - it\'s just how you portray it to the players
that\'s important!

>...personal combat and starship combat.  In both cases, GDW 
>later came out with a better system that I adopted

The beauty of the situation is that if you don\'t like everything in the new
rules, you now have 3 other rule sets and God knows how many supplements
with which to substitute your preferred rules. PLUS IG will be putting out
more advanced rules later.

>I know for a fact there is a plan to come out with

I\'m praying that this will be on time for us (BITS) to demo at Euro GEN CON
(it\'s supposed to be at GEN CON itself). I need to chase Ken on this one!

Yes, long live the Traveller Chronicle and Signal-GK, both of whom have
continued to produce good Traveller stuff even when GDW had gone down the
drain. That\'s dedication, eh?

I\'ve been pestering Ken Whitman since I first heard (through some TSR
contacts) that he was looking for investors to set up IG. I told him what I
was trying to do with BITS and he was very interested and things have gone
on since then. e.g. BITS has bought a small pile of signed MM Traveller
books for its members, and I\'ve been able to review the rules from an early
stage because Ken and I have been discussing them on the telephone. I\'m not
really "on the inside" as I\'ve not written anything for IG (except some
suggested inserts for the rules when I proof-read them) but our informal
contact seems to work out well. I pass as much as I can on to BITS members,
although some of the stuff Ken tells me is commercially sensitive so I don\'t
mention that.

>Please tell me they dropped the fractional D6\'s..2D6+1D3..from the rules. 
>Please!!!

I _think_ they\'re still in. I found in play-testing (and told Ken) that you
don\'t really seem to need them; 2, 3 or 4 d6 seem to work fine. Then there
are the lucky players who always succeed in rolling low on 4d6 so they get
to use 5 or 6 dice!

Separate section at the back plus a few bits integrated with the rules.

However, if anyone wants to throw suggestions for rules supplements or
anything else that IG doesn\'t currently have covered on its proposed product
schedule then I\'ll be glad to throw them into the CORE writers arena and see
which ideas make it out alive - possibly into print, even!

Re delurking, well I\'ve not even bothered to catch up with the postings
prior to a few days ago - I\'ve got too many other things to do including a
_proper_ job!

Babylon 5, for example. Now that game is guaranteed to sell like hot cakes.
If only Traveller had an equivalent... perhaps a movie? ;-)

  Have you looked at \'Slag!\'?

  (Although IMHO it isn\'t such a good fit with Traveller, Greg\'s Gazelle
notwithstanding. Streamlining or not has a greater effect on performance
than jump or not, for example)

If you can get water, you can get hydrogen. And the main reason for
using it is that it doesn\'t react with the graphite in the reactor even
at operating temperatures. Nor does it react to any great extent with
the rest of the motor. Water is *notorious* for being corrosive when
exposed to a high radiation flux. I rather suspect that if ammonia
isn\'t much the same, it\'ll turn out tbreak down at the operating
temperatures, which complicates things a lot.

The NERVA designs I saw all consisted of a "solid" block of graphite
and fuel pellets, with a hundred or more holes passing thru from the
front to the back. The holes were laid out in a honeycomb pattern. The
front was were the fuel pumps dumped the hydrogen. The back was where
the exhaust nozzle assembly was. The superheated hydrogen comes boiling
out of the reactor, hits the converging nozzle section and due to the
pressure behind it, it speeds up as the nozzle converges. It is going
faster, and getting compressed like crazy. At the narrowest point of
the nozzle, it hits the speed of sound (whatever that may be in
hydrogen that hot and dense). Then the nozzle widens. The rate at which
it widens is carefully calculated to make the exhaust expand at a
specific rate. At the point the nozzle ends you\'ve got the exhaust at
pretty close to ambient pressure. You don\'t take it all the way because
there are diminishing returns as the nozzle gets longer/wider.

The result is a *supersonic* exhaust. You\'ve converted a *lot* of the
random motions due to all the heat and pressure inside the motor into
*directed* motion.

Nope. Or if they do, they don\'t do it by much. As you can see from the
above, the performance of a rocket depends on the chamber pressure
going into the nozzle, the makeup of the exhaust, and the pressure
outside the nozzle. That last item determines part of the efficiency,
as you can only expand the exhaust until it gets near atmospheric
pressure. 

They may be able to "pull back" part of the end of the nozzle ( asort
of shroud) that\'d help performance a little. But the *rate* at which
the nozzle contracts, how far it contracts, aand the rate at which it
expands are fuel specific.

Right. So, just to add insult to injury, imagine the shipment had all

Or to put it another way, UPS wouldn\'t touch it with a 10 foot pole.
Fed-EX would laugh in your Face, the post office would likely have you
arrested as a terrorist for bringing it into the building. (When I
first got my copy of the handbook listing this stuff, I looked to see
if they listed anything rated 4-4-4. Much to my surprise, there were
something like 5 listed. And to be listed it has to be something used
industrially!)

It depends. Have they been doing this for a while, or are they the
equivalent of someone who just finished trucking school, and managed to
buy his own rig?

Even if they are experienced, if they didn\'t read the contract
carefully they could wind up with a choice between hauling it, or
paying a penalty fee that\'ll break them.

And never underestimate shippers. I have a friend who used to drive a
truck for a local outfit. He got told to drive a truck (already loaded)
to a local quarry on a hot summer day. Part way there, he got flagged
down by a driver who said that there was something leaking from the
truck. So jim thanked him and walked back to check the cargo (they
hadn\'t told him what it was).

He opens the doors on the back and is confronted by a couple dozen
cases of dynamite, all "sweating". It gets *hot* inside a truck parked
in the sun.

He closed the doors *gently*, and then drove *very* carefully the
remaining mile or so to the quarry. He parked the truck as far from
everything else as he could, asked someone where the "powder monkey"
was and handed him the keys to the truck (along with a "It\'s *your*
problem now" type comment). He hitched a ride back into town, handed in
the signed recipt for the cargo, told his boss that he\'d left the truck
at the quarry, and then decked him. Then he went over to payroll and
told them he was quitting and wanted his pay *now*...

Both are from the latest issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology.

1) The loss of Ariane 5 was caused by a software error in the intertial
   guidance units.  The units had been used in Ariane 4 without problems,
   and were installed in the new rocket without modification.

   The problem turns out to be twofold: A calculation which is needed when
   the rocket is on the ground was continued in flight for 40 seconds (the
   data is not needed or used in flight).  During this 40 seconds, the
   value overflowed (became too large for to calculate), causing an error
   indication.

   The error indication was assumed to be a hardware failure, and the
   guidance unit was automatically taken off-line (and began sending
   diagnostic data to the flight controls, instead of guidance data).  The
   backup guidance unit was identical, and failed in an identical fashion
   slightly before the main unit.

   The value never overflowed when the units were used in Ariane 4 because
   the older rocket flew a different trajectory (which kept the values
   within bounds for the first 40 seconds of flight).  Because the unit
   worked in a large number of Ariane 4 flights, it wasn\'t extensivelu
   tested for Ariane 5.

2) An Airbus plane being flown by Chineese pilots was lost due to the
   combination of poor training and software faults.  At low altitude in
   a landing, the co-pilot accidentally triggered the automatic throttle\'s
   "go-around" lever (this causes the throttle and autopilot to perform an
   automatic abort so that the plane can go around and try landing again.

   The pilot instructed the co-pilot to disengage the automatic throttle,
   and - since the plane was now off the glide-slope for landing - engage
   the automatic pilot to get back on glide-slope.

   The automatic pilot was in "go-around" mode (because the lever was hit
   by the co-pilot).  As the plane\'s nose came higher and higher (for the
   go-around) the pilot and co-pilot began fighting the autopilot.  As they
   pushed the nose down with the elevator, the autopilot brought it up with
   the trim controls.  Eventually, the aircraft stalled at low altitude.

   Almost any other aircraft would not have crashed in this condition; they
   automatically disengage the autopilot when the pilot moves the controls
   a significant amount.  The Airbus doesn\'t, on the theory that the pilot
   might accidentally move the control column during an automatic landing
   and cause a crash.  The Airbus also doesn\'t have a warning when the
   autopilot adjusts the trim.
   

How does this apply to Traveller?  Well, item 1 could apply to almost any
piece of computer-controlled gadgetry (even gadgetry that worked fine
before, as in this example) on a new starship, or when any ship is operated
in conditions that it\'s designers never experienced.

Item 2 could certainly apply to high-tech spacecraft, where (as in the
Airbus) the autopilot\'s programmers think they know better than the pilot
does what the aircraft should be doing.

IMHO, the Group One items (I own all but two of the items they put out, 
and all the Judges\' Guild items for Traveller) are pretty much in the 
same vein as Judges\' Guild as far as usefulness.  If you didn\'t enjoy 
JG, you probably won\'t enjoy Group One.

Just my opinion, of course.

    'body' => 'Greetings:

I\'ve been following the Traveller 1965 thread. When I get back from vacation,
I\'ll try to post book titles that are of use to you all.

Some things that you might want to look at in the meantime are:

Rude Astronauts and The Tranquility Alternative--Allen Steele--both are
direct descendents of the Bonestell/Von Braun space stuff--rockets with big
balloon fuel tanks and all that neat stuff. Look for the books by Von Braun,
Bonestell, Ley, etc.--Conquest of Space, Exploration of the Moon, Exploration
of Mars, etc.--lots of great paintings by Bonestell that will inspire you
endlessly, plus good text. Bonestell\'s paintings can be found in several
collections--either as a solo product, or with other space artists.

Movies--Keep an eye peeled for Destination Moon (loosely based on Robert A.
Heinlein\'s Rocket Ship Galileo), The Conquest of Space (based on the
Bonestell/Von Braun/Ley stuff), as well as War of the Worlds (based on
Wells), When Worlds Collide (based on two books by Wylie and another gent
whose name escapes me at the moment!)...plus Rocketship X-M, Moonbase (I
think that was the title--the screenplay was by Heinlein!) and many others.

Television: Men Into Space and other 50/early 60 TV series pop up on the Sci
Fi Channel now and again.

There\'s an art show that is floating around the country, with lots of
original Bonestell and other work that appeared in Colliers--this later
became the basis for the Bonestell/Von Braun/etc. books above. I saw it in
DC, then in NYC, then in Norfolk VA. I don\'t know where it is now, but it is
damn worth it. I think one or two books came out of this show--I\'ve got one,
and I\'ll try to remember to post the titles.

Books--scads of books would be inspiration. Murray Leinsteir. Arthur C.
Clarke (especially the "Other Side of the Sky" and "Ten Billion Names of God"
collections--navigating a ship with a abacus, imagine that!). Robert A.
Heinlein. "Doc" Smith. John W. Campbell and his pen names. Isaac Asimov
(especially the "Lucky Starr" books). Just about any "Golden Age" author,
from Astounding and many other places!

That would give you a good basis for starting the campaign, or giving the
pre-history. Advance it to the 60\'s and there you have it. I really recommend
Steele\'s Tranquility Alternative--a lot of the names are the same, but the
details are different. Dole was president--and was impeached. Kennedy was
president--but a different Kennedy. Armstrong was the first man on Mars, not
Luna. Etc., etc., etc. It\'s a bit of a short book to buy in hardcover, but I
had been waiting for it so long I could not wait for the paperback!

For a good view of "commoners in space", I recommend Steele\'s other books:
Clarke County, Space (O\'Neil style space colony); Orbital Decay (near Earth
orbit stuff); Labyrinth of Night (Mars, specifically, the "Face of Mars");
Lunar Descent (Luna), plus the first several stories in "Rude Astronauts".

Another author that has a fairly low-tech space series that I enjoyed was
Dana Stabenow--three books--Second Star, _________ Star and Red Planet Run.
Kind of clunky in terms of characterization, but they were short and light
(important qualities for bus commutes) and fun.

Well, I\'ve blathered for long enough...

Everyone I know who bought it was in the 18-22 crowd; the 30\'s crowd in
anchorage seems to play D&D or Traveller, in both cases from the 3 5x8 book
sets... Personally, I liked space 1889; however, it suffered from a lack of
a target audience and too high a price.

The other big problem I\'ve found is that Softcover Main Books just don\'t
survive. My favorite games are all falling apart due to broken spines (even
after repairs). So I\'m really glad to see a hardcover T4; my well abused
Sp1889 hardcover still looks great; my less used DarkConsp. Softcover looks
very haggard.

Well, I\'d say something, but that would give away just who I\'m 
playing in Steve\'s TCS game.  I stole titles heavily from

Christopher,

Off the top of my head:

Chameleon Eclectic will be releasing a Babylon 5 RPG in the fall,
White Wolf is going to do some sort of Sci-Fi game,
and I think SJG is going to come out with another Sci-Fi supplement 
(based on some series of books I never read, I believe).
Sorry for being so vague!  The memory isn\'t what it used to be. [G]


All this stuff is as of a few months ago, so it could have changed by now.

    'body' => 'Here are some semi-relevant thoughts I had after reading this month\'s 
Shadis magazine:

1)  Shadis is doing tie-in issues with various games.  For example, last 
month was Call of Cthulhu, this month is Star Wars.  Each month, a good 
deal of articles are based on the game-of-the-month.  In addition, each 
new subscriber who subscribes that month gets a copy of the game in 
question for free.  Perhaps IG could work out something with Shadis for 
them to do a MMT issue.  It\'d be worth donating a few hundred T4 rule 
books, IMO.

2)  Shadis had a little blurb (basically a press release, just like the 
one on IG\'s web site) about the coming of T4 this issue.  The interesting 
thing was that I hadn\'t realized my favorite Shadis column is written by 
Lester W. Smith (the guy charged with developing the Traveller system).  
I love his Weasel Games column.  If the book is written as well as his 
column, I\'m going to be thrilled.

3)  This issue has a Gamer\'s Lexicon article.  It is quite good.  Some of 
the included terms:

	Baby Face Rule:  In fantasy and horror campaigns, any child or 
			seemingly innocent creature found alone in a 
			dungeon will actually be a soul-sucking monster.

	Dice Junkie:	Any player who owns more dice than socks.

	Rubber Suit Syndrome: In science-fiction games, the tendency of GMs
			and players to portray aliens both physically and
			psychologically as 20th-century Americans in rubber
			suits instead of non-humans from strange worlds,
			divergent evolutionary paths, and unique cultures.

    I admit to being somewhat of a lexicon junkie (among my bathroom 
reading material is a copy of the Hacker\'s Dictionary, for instance), but 
I think most of the people who frequent this list will find this article 
enjoyable.

Pick up a copy of Shadis 27.  Oh, and Shadis 28 is supposed to have a 
review of T4.

Although 1m works just as well. Actually, it\'s been so long since I\'ve
actually designed, I don\'t remember how much the interdeck was! I just threw
off a few numbers.

        I\'ve got a better one for you ... a (nameless) company on a
(nameless) test program allegedly (this was before my time) loaded the
ground test software instead of the flight software for launch. Now, the
ground test software is intended to verify all the actuators, nozzles, etc.
are working, and ignores the navigation signals. So the rocket was launched,
all the nozzles immediately slewed hard to one side, paused, then slewed
hard to the other side ...

        Seems to be a difference in philosophy between Europeans and
Americans. Here, the Pilot in Command is IN COMMAND. Example: Airbus flight
control software won\'t let you exceed the limits of the plane. You can pull
back on the stick as hard as you want, it won\'t go beyond design limits. On
a MacDac or Boing, they assume if you\'re REALLY pulling, you must REALLY
want to do it. I\'ve heard of a 747 that had a problem inflight, slipped into
a dive, and the pilot bent the wings pulling out. The plane made it back to
the airport instead of splashing.

Yup...but dear Guv Fife had a good reputation at the time he took out 
the loans (whether he deserved the reputation or not is questionable, 
and certainly that reputation was built at least partially on 
creative accounting)  Having a squeaky clean reputation, and BEING 
squeaky clean aren\'t the same...as Fife certainly has proven...

True...  Guess I assumed that things were as represented...  If the 
person or persons getting the loan are found out as misrepresenting, 
then we\'re talking fraud...  Certainly...the lender would have the 
right to terminate the loan in those circumstances...

Well actually, since Imperiallines is the power circle\'s FedEx...  I 
don\'t think they\'d be all that thrilled to see it...   And if we 
carry the FedEx example much farther than I ever intended it...  
Everybody but the riffraff would use it occasionally, and it would 
definitely (at least to some extent) lessen the importance of the 
XBoat system...  Keep in mind the XBoat\'s don\'t just carry TNS...  
They also carry personal mail, parcels, etc...  At least as presented 
in (GOD, HERE\'S THAT WORD AGAIN) the "canon."

To some extent you\'re wrong here.  FedEx got where they did when they 
did because they did use some state of the art package tracking 
systems that took advantage of early 80\'s improvements in computer 
technology.  No, the fleet of Boeing\'s weren\'t ground-breaking 
particularly, but the way they were used, and the information 
technology used to create the overnight shipping business (which

breaking...  (Not to mention actually realizing that somebody might 
pay a premium to get a letter, parcel, document, etc, overnight

You\'re focusing too literally on the FedEx example...  Actually we\'re 
in agreement here if you think about it...  I said that a group of 
PC\'s setting up a J-6 courier business would have a tough time...  If 
they didn\'t toe the Imperial line, they wouldn\'t have a tough 
time...they\'d be shut out of business, when they found it hard to get 
any sizable contracts.  Essentially, they would either get Religion 
about the Imperium real quick, or they\'d be out of business even 
quicker...

Actually, the USPS does match FedEx\'s speed (maybe not reliability,

The gist of Steve\'s statement is that the fans made CT/MT/TNE. It is our purchasing power, but 
more importantly, our interest. I work with a local hobby store coordinating games in their 
game room. The pressure there is to run something that the store is selling. My problem is that 
the games I like are all out of print: Dark Conspiracy, TNE, Space:1889, more recently XXVc 
(The Buck Rogers in the 25th Century). How can these games be run at the retailers store? 

The hot stuff (just about anything from White Dwarf) is easy. Post a game and turn the folks 
away. For the more obscure stuff (Traveller has been slipping into this category), I have to be 
a little more creative. I have run miniature table-top free-for-alls using the TNE personal 
combat system. (I like it as one of the most realistic and playable that I\'ve seen.) I had 
Space Vampires, chanting witches, and power-armored combat veterans running around. I sold the 
game to the retailer as a promotion for miniatures. However, the in-stock TNE books sold out 
within the week. (Only 4 copies, I\'m not bragging.) While running the game I clearly indicated 
where the combat system came from, as well as, how I designed the weapons. I even drafted the 
witch\'s *spells* from the psionics rules. Changed the names for the technically challenged.

How then to overcome fan inertia? Take IGs challenge and publish for their system. Send stuff 
to them or their licensees. I too played CT before Books 4 & 5. I was impressed at the stuff 
from the Judges Guild and FASA. The plethora(?) of information available was incredible at the 
time. The GDW-TM typos actually attracted me in the anti-establishment way of the times. I will 
try to take up Steve\'s plea and pledge to submit. One word of warning: another attraction was 
that the competing system D&D books at the time were $15, the CT books $4.95.

Off my soapbox now...

Questions:  (to help me submit...)

1.  Are the beasties compatible with the TNE creature generation rules. I have some 
terrain-based encounter tables for various worlds that I have complete with cheesy home-brewed 
illustrations.

2.  Can some one in the know please post all current licensees and known publications for T4. 
Their submission guidelines would be nice as well.

3.  Has someone compiled a list of genre ships? When QSDS was birthing, I was overwhelmed by 
conversions of the Safari ship, the Scout, the lab ship, the far/fat trader - pure canon. I 
have seen some other designes but mostly extension of the Traveller designs. I know there are 
special purpose ships in the minds of the TML. Has anyone come up with a list of these 
*concept* ships?

4.  How much year 0 history is *up for grabs*, regarding development. For example, I believe 
the Judges Guild developed the Ley Sector (please correct me if I am wrong). What is available 
for freelance development.

I will have more questions now that I am up and running. Also regards DECKPLANS. I was one of 
the ones who was going to post some CorelDraw3 deckplan symbols. My 5 volt PS took out my SCSI 
adapter driving the Bernoulli that held the plans. I am gettin a new adapter within the week 
and will send them...where? To DJGolden? others?

Japanese, for one. I have the Aug. 1992 issue of "RPG Magazine", 
the Hobby Japan house organ. The feature of "Replay Jam" 
(essentially a "you are there" recap of a gaming session 
of the featured product) was "Knightfall. (also in that issue: 
Runequest Vikings and "Alphonse", a Patlabor RPG) 
 
 I also have a Hobby Japan catalogue with Traveller  
and MegaTraveller. 
 
One thing I notice: the cover art beats anything that 
appeared on the originals. Note to Ken Whitman: 
in any "Art of Traveller" book or prints, GET THE  
JAPANESE STUFF TOO!!!!!!!!!!! 
 
If anyone wants to read the Knightfall Replay Jam, 
I have it translated, it\'s about 30K, too long to 
post willy-nilly. Email me and I\'ll send it.

Joe, when you come up with something, why not submit it here and to JTAS? 
There are a number of people who want a REALLY simple system - one actor 
even wanted to just use a descriptive system. This is something that 
people could use if they don\'t want a starship encounter to dominate the 
session, just whip out the USCS (Unbelievably Simple Combat System) for 5 
minutes. I wouldn\'t imagine such a system being so wordy that it can\'t 
fit in a JTAS article.

BTW, what are the guidelines for producing stuff here? I know that IG is 
going back to the "all rights reserved" method - when you sell them an 
article, they buy ALL the rights: first publishing, reprints, etc.

However, does sending stuff to these mailing list count as "publishing"? 
No-one ever answered my query on this. My hope is that the lists can be 
used to knock the rough edges off an article (or plug the gaping holes) 
so that the final submitted work is as good as you can make it. Any 
copyright lawyers out there (Glenn, ideas)?

Can IG reply to this so we have a clear indication of whether we can 
refine our ideas thru the lists?

Yup...good point William.  I have 2 sets of CT little black books, 2 
sets of MT, 2 sets of TNE, and they are all in varying sorts of 
decay not from neglect, but just from heavy use.  The MT books, 
which I\'ve used most, are held together with paste and a prayer at 
this point...

I have to admit I bought 3 of the hardcovers, (1 to put away) just so 
that I could have a couple of copies to use that would survive the 
long haul...

Twilight: 2000 sold _extremely_ well. Not to mention, the Twilight: 2000
mechanics are descended (through several internal iterations) from Traveller.

Depends on what you mean by successful. All of them sold well enough to
amortize their development costs. Space: 1889 was the only one that was cut
because sales were dropping, but a smaller company would have _loved_ to have
had sales numbers like it had.

Both 2300 AD and Dark Conspiracy fell prey to too few resources (capital,
design/development/production staff, etc.). We did not have the internal
resources to properly support all of them at once.

I wasn\'t aware that there was still any controversy over this point. I was
there...TNE did not kill GDW.

Mostly true. Space: 1889 fans are born, not made. We had a small handout
printed up that explained the background. You could hand it to a person, they
would read it, and one of two things happened: 1) They instantly loved the
idea. 2) They gave the brochure back and asked: "What else ya got?" It didn\'t
seem to be age-related (there were many 16-year-old Space: 1889 fanatics...I
knew of some 12-year-old fans). Sales were levelling off, and at a low enough
level to make the game\'s long term viability uncertain. Still, it remained
the license that would not die. There is still a chance the movie will get
made, and that would do a lot to revitalize the game.

You didn\'t see the list of _other_ licensed products. Had the lawsuit held
off for another couple of months, the JVC and Nintendo contracts would have
been signed, and there would have been a few hundred more lawyers on our side
(JVC hires lawyers in platoon-sized units). As it was, the other contractees
said "come see us when the lawsuit is over." Things might have turned out
differently had there been no lawsuit...

For those of you interested in an insider\'s viewpoint: GDW failed due to a
number of factors, any one of which (hell, any three of which) we could have
survived alone.

Given the obvious maintenance problems, I\'d lay odds that the cieling
in a stateroom is only 2.5m giving you almost a meter of "crawl space"
for maintenance. 

For that matter, if *I* was designing a multi-deck ship, I\'d do it like
this:

- ----	<-- ceiling
				^
				|
cabin				+-- 2.5 meters
				|
				v
- ----	<-- floor
				^
				|
equipment space			+-- 2 meters
				v
- ----	<-- ceiling
				^
				|
cabin				+-- 2.5 meters
				|
				v
- ----	<-- floor

This gives the proper 7 meters for two decks, but gives you a whole two
meters to run ducts, wiring, etc, and gives you enough *room* to get at
them without crawling thru someone\'s cabin. And there are probably
several rather large "conduits" running vertically between decks,
complete with built in ladders. (Star Trek *finally* got around to this
in the last few years)

BTW, given that just about *all* the ships that the average person is
familiar with are laid out on the "a few big horizontal decks" model,
going back to the more realistic "lots of decks stacked vertically"
model will actually provide a feel of "Hey! This is *different*."

Remember, Star Trek (in all forms), Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica,
Buck Rogers, etc *all* have the decks laid out *parallel* to the thrust
axis. Babylon 5 doesn\'t, but it isn\'t *obvious* that it isn\'t. So to
all but us "old folks", this will be a "new" idea.

Oh yeah, the access panels for the "service spaces" are going to be
both secured (need tools or a key or both to open) *and* alarmed. They
make too good a place for hijackers to utilize.

And they make "taking" a ship that much more interesting. The crew is
going to know the spaces a lot better than any invading force.
Especially if their ship isn\'t a standard design.

They even make it easier to smuggle things, as you can put in false
ducts and the like. Of course then you haver the problem of moving the
stuff from the berth to the customer.

Actually, the position that there are so many horizontal deck ships out
there is my argument for sticking with the present, mixed system.  I think
playability and flavor are enhanced and preserved with horizontal deck
ships; I won\'t go into why, but the main reason for wanting such decks to
be common and usual is so I won\'t have to design a hundred more ships to
keep the richness and variety I have now!

Every issue of challenge, every adventure or double adventure, every
supplement, magazine, etc. originaally got my bucks by having one,
sometimes simple deckplan in it.  They are almost all horizontal, usually
quite usable and accurate (exception: Where on the King Richard (from
FASA\'s Action Aboard) do they put all the fuel, drives, etc?!?) and let me
showcase a different ship every two or three  sessions.

You can argue for vertically oriented decks, but give me my traveller
ships!  Hell, I\'ve imported ship designs from other venues, which usually
use horizontal decks, for traveller several times...I\'m sure I\'m not the
only one who came up for stats on the Battleship Yamato (or
Argo...Wildstar??) or the Battlestar Galactica, or even the Eagle modular 
cutter from Space:1999.

Other arguments exist, and I think in the Real World(tm) ships would
probably be oiented as you feel they sould, but I am not the first to
point out that traveller is *not* the real world.   

I think I\'ll try to usse the SSDS to make up stats for the Milennium
Falcon tonight...

[....2 meter inter-deck space between decks...]

I originally tried that, but dropped it back to 1 meter.  I wanted a space
below AND above each deckspace to handle certain things..like grav modules. 
The space goes up to 2 meters in some places and in others like cargo holes
and engine rooms the ceiling sometimes disappears and the ductwork and
pipes are exposed.  I purposely make the "overheads" a warren of different
height and width crawlspaces.

Absolutely!  That\'s why I do it.  <g> I could care less about the real need
for crawlspaces, I do this totally for the game effect.

D\'oohhh!  I did not even think about that.  My local hobby store actually 
operates a whole shop devoted solely to allowing people to come in and play 
store-sponsored games.  Miniatures stuff does seem to provoke interest and 
bring in new people.  I am not sure the new combat system (range bands choke) 
will be a huge draw, but the Traveller Strategic Battles thing from GenCon this 
year might be a really good thing for Imperium Games to send copies to game 
stores for demo purposes.  Hey, IG!  Did you catch that?

I would suspect that you will be able to use the CT animal definition rules 
with only minor modifications.  The are that is likely to need to modification 
work would be the combat statistics; specifically how much damage it does and 
what sort of armor protection it has.   If the animal rules change armor in the 
descriptions to an absolute numeric value, you\'ll just need to convert the 
description of the armor to the protection value of the human-style armor the 
creature is described as having as a natural skin.  I suspect the animal 
damages values will have a lot of the "1d3" things we\'ve been warned about, but 
Andy Lilly apparently has found the d3 parts can be dropped with little 
appreciable effect.

>2.  Can some one in the know please post all current licensees and known

>Their submission guidelines would be nice as well.
The Imperium Games submission guidelines are on the \'net 
(www.imperiumgames.com).  As for other licensed publishers, the only one I\'ve 
heard of is the one Andy Lilly mentioned yesterday, which I guess is in some 
way associated with BITS.  It sounded like Sword of the Knight (the people that 
do the Traveller Chronicle) will be publishing that item in the US, so I 
suspect they are going to have some sort of license as well.  If you don\'t have 
net access send me an email (scharlto@rtd.com) and I\'ll send you a copy of the 
guidelines I downloaded from the net.

What do you mean by concept ships?  I did the "basic" designs (Far Trader, Free 
Trader, Scout etc) that are supposedly going to appear in the new Traveller; 
some early versions of these were posted here.  I\'ve since done a fairly large 
pile of other designs (SDBs, larger merchants, larger combatants, a Luxury 
Liner and some other assorted vessels).  Some of the "non-canon" ships I have 
come up with include a Marine Company Transport, a salvage ship, a hospital 
ship, a really big lab ship, a "pocket carrier", a hazardous cargo ship and a 
modular freighter.  I will probably be posting the other new ships here in the 
next week or so.

The Judge\'s Guild stuff was generally of very poor quality, and was declared 
"non-canon" long ago by GDW.  It sounds like MM/IG intend to leave large chunks 
of space (nearly all of it) intentionally undefined to allow people to create 
the unique universes they want.  I suspect that IG will be developing Core, 
Spinward Marches and Solomani Rim sectors themselves, but beyond that I think 
there won\'t be any "land grant" activities like those from early Traveller 
days.  Therefore, I imagine nearly everything is available for freelance 
development, but it will be interesting to see how IG is going to reconcile 
their "undefined space" goal with the use of freelance adventures and source 
materials set in non-IG sectors.

Good luck, Norm.  I hope to see some of your stuff in print in the (not so) Far 
Future.

I\'ve heard a couple of people stating that, and I remember  
that AT THE TIME, it was rather poorly compared to offerings 
from GDW itself, FASA, the Keith\'s outfit, etc.  However, I 
managed to pick up Ley Sector, Glimmerdrift Sector, and one 
other Judge\'s Guild thing a year or so ago. 
 
They\'re a hell of a lot better than I remembered, and many 
orders of magnitude better than that dreck of Chuck Gannon\'s 
Challenge was publishing in its last days.  I fail to see 
what is "very poor quality" about the JG sectors, in any case. 
I hear the adventures weren\'t so good, but I don\'t have them, 
so I can\'t say.

        I\'m no lawyer, but both the Quick Ship Design System published in
the basic book, and the slightly more detailed Standard Ship Design System,
to be in the "Starships" supplement, were not just refined but created from
basically nothing in a single week on the GDW Beta List. So there\'s precedent.

        Well, yeah, my assumption rests on the pilot being right. But
personally, I\'d rather have the pilot be able to do what he wants, and risk
crashing, than going down KNOWING the pilot could pull out if the computer
let him.

I liked playing Twilight: 2000.  The problem is, everyone else in our 
group did, too.  Meaning, no one wanted to GM the game! :(  After 
shuffling the responsibilities between us a number of times, we finally 
gave up and moved on.  This is the only game we played (and there were 
dozens of games over the years) wherein this occurred.  

I had a LOT of fun playing it the few times I did, though. I loved it.

So GDW was spreading itself too thin, eh?  That\'s pretty common in 
business, and nothing (IMO) to feel particularly bad about.  The 
consequences of this mistake are pretty bad, but it is soooo easy to make 
(thus the $1000-a-head seminars on "refocusing on core competencies" and 
other claptrap).

One product rarely does.  The holding company I work for has owned a 
range of businesses from cash cows to dogs.  The dogs we\'ve owned have 
had poor performance from a variety of reasons.  It\'s just never so neat 
you can say "if you would/wouldn\'t have done /this/, you would have 
succeeded." 

GDW had a long and successful run.  So it didn\'t last forever.  That\'s no 
sin.

:)  True.  But, in your case I think it\'s a little less sick.  You were 
part of the group that shaped Traveller into what it was.  I\'m just a 
fan-boy. :P

Let\'s see...we have:

1)  Lawsuit
2)  GDW spreading itself too thin (talent, capital, etc.)
3)  Talent flight (Guessing here - not saying there was no talent left, but
                   some major players had moved on, which always hurts at
                   least in the short run.)
4)  New competition (Suddenly CCG\'s and diceless/storytelling games 
                     began to dominate.)
5)  Changing Demographics (Linked to #4, above:  The younger set tended 
                           toward products different from what GDW wanted,
                           and as usual the older customers tended to stop
                           playing as they got jobs, families, etc.)

Others?  [May as well write the "death of GDW" history/case study now rather
          than wait for the historians to do it when the participants aren\'t
          available.:)]

Yes, but they were later given the Traveller version of 
excommunication, and were declared (JARGON ALERT) "non-canon" 
by GDW and/or DGP in the MT days...the Ley Sector on the FTP sites is 
*NOT* the Ley Sector of Judges Guild fame, other than the sector 
name...

Why this is the case I don\'t know.  Judge\'s Guilds sectors were of 
good (not great) quality, and at a time when GDW was still only 
publishing Solomani Rim & Spinward Marches, it was fun to use the 4 
of them...  They were the setting of a number of my early 
adventures...

The adventures on the other hand, I had the chance to inspect a lot, 
in game stores when they came out, and they never thrilled me.  
Definitely several notches below the quality of  FASA, Keith 
Brothers, and the GDW stuff...

I have the 4 Judge\'s Guild sectors (Ley Sector, Glimmerdrift Reaches, 
Gateway Sector, and Maranantha-Alkahest).  They are non-canon, but 
they weren\'t BAD products...  Probably worth getting if you find a 
deal...

That was "Tex" Johnson, Chief Test Pilot for Boeing at the time (and that
time was quite a while ago - it was when the 707 was brand-new).  One
interesting factoid about that stunt: although it nearly caused the Boeing
executives watching to have heart attacks, it certainly sold the airplane to
the pilots in the audience.

The roll he performed wasn\'t the same style of roll that you usually see in
airshows (where the plane rolls about it\'s long axis, with the center of the
roll going through the center of the plane).  Instead, he rolled the plane
around the surface of an imaginary cylinder (the axis of the roll was
outside, above the plane but parallel to it).

The reason for this is that 1) Boeing jetliners aren\'t stressed for heavy
negative G\'s (the 747 is only designed for -1G), and 2) the instruments
installed weren\'t designed for inverted flight - they\'d all go out if the
707 pulled negative Gs.  The type of roll that "Tex" performed keeps the
plane in positive Gs all the way around (even though the plane goes inverted
at the top of the roll) due to centripetal force.

        I remember this now! Air & Space Magazine had an article about the
707 a while back. The president of Boeing had a bunch of airline execs on a
houseboat trying to sell them the plane, and he\'d arranged for a FLYBY by
the 707. The pilot was fired for his stunt, until all the orders started
pouring in from impressed airlines and they forgave him.

        Actually, I can tell you why some ships use horizontal decks.  And
of course, people get used to those, so other ships imitate them...and so on.
        Anyway, take a look at the Type S scout.  It is a lot easier to land
a ship like that horzontaly than vertically, and it\'s kind\'a convienient
that the deck goes the same way as the ground, especially since the grav
generators shut down when you take out the keys...

systematically. My reference here is QSDS/SSDS -- those are already
published, with agreed-upon rules, so they shouldn\'t be contradicted by
something new. Otherwise you wind up with the MegaTraveller fiasco -- errata
after errata. Not that the new rules can\'t EXPAND the scope of the QSDS/SSDS
rules, but they shouldn\'t CONTRADICT. For the record, QSDS/SSDS were given
as a base rule to use Fire, Fusion and Steel with a few simple modifications
        - Thruster plates are standard tech; base cost is 25% of FF&S
        - Fusion plants below TL12 have 10x the listed minimum volume
        - ContraGravity goes back to the MegaTraveller definition --
provides both lift and thrust.

        Did I forget any?


*****NOTE*****

Before flaming me for trying to force Fire, Fusion and Steel down anybody\'s
throats: I\'M NOT!  What I\'m trying to do is make sure that the vehicle
system doesn\'t contradict the ALREADY PUBLISHED spacecraft design sequence
for T4. Those sequences happened to be based on modified FF&S. While
designing SSDS I specifically asked about weapons, armor and combat changes,
thinking they were sure to change, and was told to stick with FF&S, that
whatever followed would be compatible and wouldn\'t invalidate SSDS. Mostly
I\'m just commenting on areas that are incompatible with SSDS/QSDS.

**************

Here goes:

General comments
================
        - Don\'t use displacement tons for vehicles, use m3.
        - I\'d still recommend not worrying about spacecraft, even small
ones, in the vehicle rules. Vehicles should include those craft designed
primarily for use in a planetary environment. I know, grav vehicles can make
it into low orbit, but contragrav rapidly drops in effectiveness as the
local gravity goes down. Spacecraft of any size should be covered in the
spacecraft rules. Otherwise we\'ll have an even worse patchwork of slighlty
incompatible rules.

====================
Armor
====================
We\'ve been over this one several times -- changing how armor is defined and
rated invalidates the entire hull section of both QSDS and SSDS.

Also, the toughnesses listed don\'t match the ones used in QSDS/SSDS in some
cases, and the masses are off by a factor of 10. And why are the masses
given per SQUARE meter? Or are you just assuming the 1cm thickness? Don\'t do
this -- density is based on VOLUME. And even so, the masses don\'t always match

====================
Fuel Cells
====================

Again, IIRC there were fuel cells already published in SSDS/QSDS (I\'ve
temporarily misplaced my copy of what went out, so I can\'t swear). The TL7
fuel cell should have an efficiency of 0.5MW per m3 instead of 0.4.
Otherwise anybody who designs vehicles would be stupid not to grab an
SSDS/QSDS fuel cell instead. Also, the min vols were greater, and the fuel
requirement was more

GENERAL NOTE: Don\'t tell me how much fuel it takes for 100hrs. Give it to me
per hour. Nobody designs cars to run for 100hrs.

Mass for TL6 and TL7 fission plants is off from FF&S, but I don\'t think any
of those were included in SSDS

====================
Fusion Plants
====================

Fusion plants are wrong compared to the ones used in SSDS. Again, anybody
with brains will pull the ones out of SSDS. Correct values are

     MW per   Mass    MCr     Min Vol/    Fuel
TL   m3       per m3  per m3  Min Pwr     kl/YR
9    2.0      4.0     0.2     1000/2000   0.15
10   2.0      4.0     0.2     500/1000    0.15
11   2.0      4.0     0.2     200/400     0.15
12   2.0      4.0     0.2     10/20       0.15
13   3.0      3.0     0.2     1/3         0.1
14   3.0      3.0     0.2     0.25/0.75   0.1
15   6.0      2.0     0.2     0.1/0.6     0.1
16   7.0      1.0     0.2     0.075/0.525 0.1

====================
Storage Banks
====================
While storage banks aren\'t specifically mentioned in SSDS, one type
(Homopolar Generators) was used in the design of all the weapons -- the
impact is that all the weapons designs are off. Of course, this is assuming
storage banks are the generic replacement for both batteries and
HPGs/Capacitors. There\'s no other mention of accumulator-type devices in the
rules.

====================
Contra Grav
====================
The values for contragrav differ from the agreed-upon values used to
generate the charts for SSDS. The change back to lift+thrust is there, but
the specific values are different. Not only that, but an entire category is
missing. Again, this breaks ship design.

Here\'s the table I sent Greg then (beginning of June):

>                          Volume      Mass   Power   Cost     Min Vol
>   Type             TL  m^3/tonne-th  t/m^3  MW/m^3  MCr/m^3  m^3
>   ----      --  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
>   Standard          9     0.0333      0.4    0.3      0.02     1
>   Improved         10     0.02        0.3    0.2      0.025    0.3
>   High Efficiency  12     0.02        0.2    0.1      0.03     0.03

====================
Thruster Plates
====================
Again, the values shown in the draft vehicle document are NOT the values
that went into both SSDS and QSDS, straight from FF&S except the price was
changed. Changing them means both the basic book and the starships book have
built-in errors, and need correcting via errata. That was the biggest strike
against MegaTraveller, and certainly won\'t help T4.

 TL	Thrust    Power   Mass    Min v/       Cost      Area
        per m3    per m3  per m3  min thrust   per m3	 per m3
Vehicle 33t       .83Mw   1.65t   1.0m3/33t    .200MCr   .35m2	
Q/SSDS  40t       1.0     2.0     not given    MCr0.250  0.20m2

===================
Life Support
===================
Once again, these numbers are completely different. While QSDS/SSDS didn\'t
have any TL variations in space & mass, that\'s not necessarily a problem.
You could just say QSDS/SSDS used only TL9 life support for simplicity, and
allow improvements with TL. But the TL9 values should agree!

Also, instead of telling me how much volume is supported per m3 of life
support, tell me how much life support I need for 1m3. After all, what if I
need a different volume? Saying 1m3 of life support covers 1700m3 of ship
doesn\'t really help me if I\'ve got a 2800m3 ship. I\'d rather be able to
multiply 2800m3 by a simple factor, and know how much life support I need.

Here\'s the numbers from SSDS (in your format). These should be the base
values at TL9, and you can go up from there:

          Volume covered  Mass per   Power   Cost
          per m3          m3 of LS   per m3  per m3
Basic     200m3           1t         0.02MW  MCr0.06
Advanced  125m3           1t         0.025MW MCr0.0625

===================
Gravity Compensators
===================
These also don\'t have TL variations in SSDS; again that can be explained by
picking the lowest TL, and saying that for simplicity all grav compensators
in SSDS were built at that TL. But the values AT THAT TL STILL HAVE TO
MATCH! Also note that SSDS didn\'t have it depend on number of G\'s
compensated -- the volume was the same, but the MAXIMUM number of G\'s
compensated went up with TL. In other words, at TL 12, any installation
could compensate 3Gs -- you didn\'t buy a 1G or 2G installation, they ALL did
3Gs. At TL10, all you could get was 1G.

I do like that you\'ve got the values here as a factor per m3 of coverage --
be consistent and make all tables like that.

Per SSDS, the values should be

    Volume per m3  Mass    Power   Cost
TL  protected      per m3  per m3  per m3
10   0.01          2t      0.5MW   MCr0.05

Max G\'s vs TL:
10      1G
11      2G
12      3G
13      4G
14      5G
15      6G
16      7G
18      8G
20      9G

====================
Communicators
====================
Your power requirements are too low and your volumes are too high. Not for
reality, I\'m not addressing that. But they again don\'t match up with the
ones used in SSDS/QSDS. The tightbeam (laser/maser) and jammer rules also
don\'t mesh with what\'s in SSDS/QSDS. And where are meson communicators

====================
Sensors
====================
Same comments as above. You\'re invalidating every single electronics package
in SSDS/QSDS. And I really hate range bands. The rules used to generate the
components in SSDS/QSDS are in FF&S, pp49-55


*******************************************************
Summary

basic book and the starships book wrong, and all the existing ship designs
built under them wrong, publishing errata for them, or change the vehicle

This *is* somewhat reasonable. HTHL and even VTHL craft will use
horizontal decks. But having the thrust axis running at right angles to
the deck *is* a safety hazard. And since the Type-S only has what? A 2g
drive? You can even have people asking "Why are there rungs on the
ceiling of the main passage?" 

The answer, of course, is that they are for getting around if the
compensators are out.

compensators? or do these devices not work to well?.
perhaps vertical deckplans are more apt for military vessels intended to 
undergo evasive maneuvers. these vessels wouldn\'t be intended to dock 
(unlike cargo craft) on planets, so the point about the decks being 
parralel with the ground, would be moot; if the inertial comps had any 
lag time (ie., it took a nanosecond to adjust to the new direction during 
evasive), then perhaps the vertical deckplans might mitigate some of the 
violence. Azhanti High Lightning, I note, used vertical deckplans. Of 
course, a ship REALLY designed for evasive maneuvers -the gazelle class 
and its brethren - uses horizontal deckplans.
Perhaps, also, it\'s a size issue. larger ships aren\'t intended to enter a 
gravity well anyway, so as before the \'decks-parallel-to-ground\' 
consideration doesn\'t hold. More importantly, the decks provide natural 
bulkheads for sealing sections off. On a cylindrical (eg) hull, the 
horizontal decks only divide up *very large* sections, and you\'d have to 
make a bunch of extra bulkheads in each deck, to get manageably small 
sections. again, perhaps not so much concern except in a warship. . .

    'body' => 'Hi,

Just in case anyone is wondering whether I followed up on the leads to 
the Slag! starship combat game....

I went to Games Plus, a somewhat-local RPG store.  I\'ve shopped there 
several times before, and I\'ve enjoyed the experience each time.  They 
have lots of out-of-print items (including a copy of T:NE boxed edition, 
until I bought it last time I was there :), and a great selection of 
current items.

I looked around a bit for Slag!, but couldn\'t find it immediately in their 
rather large selection of RPG items.  Being lazy, I asked the clerk 
whether they had it.  He said, "It\'s over here in our new item area," 
helpfully leading me to the place.  I picked it up, thanked him, and asked 
whether he had another product which I\'d seen reviewed favorably in the 
last issue of Shadis.  The response I got shocked me.

The product in question is perhaps not the most tasteful product ever 
made in the gaming industry.  But, the review in Shadis was favorable, 
and recommended it not as a game to /play/, but to /read/, as it was 
"laugh-out-loud funny."  I had decided this was something I wanted to 
have.  Thus, my inquiry. (The game in question is called "HOL.")

What the clerk said when I asked for that product was that they did not 
carry it because the owner objeced to the material included in it.  The 
clerk added that he objected to it as well.  I replied that it seemed, 
to me (from reading the review), to be a good parody of RPG\'s.  The 
clerk seemed surprised at this thought, and granted that could possibly 
be so.  (I inferred that he had probably not read the book.)

Anyway, I was shocked at this.   After spending my early teen years being 
told by hobby shop owners, book store owners, and adults in general that 
my hobby was inherently "Satanic," and definitely bad for my mental 
health and the fate of my immortal soul, I was not ready to see such 
abundant ignorance displayed in a game store.

Now, I\'m not saying the owner of that store does not have a right to 
refuse to sell certain products.  He most certainly does.  He is no part of 
the government, so it is not censorship.  Nonetheless, the idea apalled me.

Prior to being shown where Slag! was, I\'d picked up a few other items.  
But after consulting with my (equally shocked) wife, we decided it would 
be best not to spend our money in that store ever again.  Again, not 
because we felt the owner was doing something legally or morally wrong.  
Rather, we made our decision because we did not agree with his ethical 
stance.  "Vote with your dollars," as they say.

So, I put the items back where I had found them, and we left.

Now I am more determined than ever to get a copy of HOL, of course. ;)  

I wonder whether any luddites out there will ban Traveller from their 
shops... "Why, it\'s liable to give kids the idea that we should be 
spendin\' money on that boondoggle of a space program!"

Anyway, I\'ll look for Slag! and HOL at GenCon.  If I can\'t get them there, 
I\'ll order from one of the folks I know who sell RPG stuff through the 
Internet.

I wasn\'t disagreeing with you (in fact, I heartily agree with you).  I
just haven\'t decided whether its a good or a bad thing that a Boeing 707
is design-capable (i.e. he didn\'t bend the wings, as in David Golden\'s
earlier example) of doing a roll.

But for ships that don\'t need to land, where would be the advantage in
this? (you won\'t be taking the keys out!). A ship that has few decks that
are long would feel "bigger" and more spaceous than one with many smaller
decks. Maybe the early designers picked up on this fact and designed the
subserquent ships with this in mind.

The X-Boat tender is one ship that I know of that has it\'s decks in a
vertical arrangement (ie. not alined with the long axis of the ship or
thrust). I\'m guessing that this was chosen to facilitate maximum room for
the docking hold thing.

Another point is there is less space wasted in having longer decks as
opposed to the shorter, smaller decks (ie less bulkhead, bracing etc..) in
needed.

   You\'re being a bit more than kind.  Here\'s a description I found on the
Internet of a HoL scenario somebody is going to be running during
PhoenixCon:

B-119-2 HoL: "He Ate the HoL Thing." The Church and Munch starship
"All You Can Eat" has sent a distress signal. Its origin: the HoL, Human
occupied Landfill! As this vessel is scheduled to cater the MegaPope\'s
birthday party, he has authorized the following statement: "Any
individuals who can get the cargo off-planet intact will get a  FULL
PARDON!" Characters provided. Novice level, 6 players. GM John Moore.

   <sarcasm alert> Gee, *nothing* sacrilegious in that....

   The description also indicates that the scenario is for individuals 18
and over.

>What the clerk said when I asked for that product was that they did not

   As is their US Constitutionally guaranteed right, whether that decision
was made in ignorance or not.

   Analogous to Paranoia then (having never actually seen HoL)?
In some ways, I could see where they just don\'t get the joke.  Some
people get totally turned off by bathroom humor or dead baby jokes, and
some people can\'t stand religious humor (and frequently those that don\'t
like the latter, don\'t the either of the former either).

   Something else to consider.  If this game is normally intended for adults,
keeping the game in a store where the average age of the customer is
below 18 can be a big problem.  It could be that the game store owner
doesn\'t so much object to the content of the game as he doesn\'t want
the hassle of controlling access to it by minors.  Certainly he wouldn\'t
want to take the phone call of an irate parent who\'s little Billy (or
whatever) had been sold the game by accident.

   If I were you, I would call the game store and ask to speak to the
owner.  Get it straight from him why he doesn\'t offer the game for sale,
and let him know why you feel it necessary to take your business
elsewhere.  It could be there are other issues involved than just religious
or moral.  If nothing else, he will realize that his stand is costing him
business.

Harold

It\'s important to note that the time this required was such that "Tex" was

It\'s not (that\'s why the executives all practically had heart-attacks).
However, the particular maneuver that the pilot chose wasn\'t any more
stressful for the plane that a sustained 2G turn.

ObTraveller: This is why someone who is a Pilot-6 should be able to make a
skill roll and save your starship\'s bacon where a Pilot-2 wouldn\'t be able
to handle it.  Skills are important.

They do.  What do you think the wires connecting the chip to the pin

We have found large natural deposits ON-planet.  Industrial diamonds 
are relatively cheap; the price of gem-quality diamonds is held 
artificially high by the diamond cartel.  If the supply of gem-diamonds 
wasn\'t tightly controlled, diamonds wouldn\'t cost much more than 
amethysts or pearls, if that much.   
 
And diamond-dust coated sharpening rods are a standard fixture 
in cutlery stores... I own a pair myself.  We don\'t use diamond 
as a cutting edge because it is *brittle*.  A diamond-bladed knife 
would have problems with shattering with sharp blows.  It\'s 
diamond DUST that is used for cutting--as an abrasive that will 
abrade ANYTHING.  And diamond dust is getting cheaper, and appearing 
in more consumer applications (cf. sharpening rods mentioned above).

Quite the opposite, if anything.  They\'ve flown the most 
controversial bits past an audience (us) to see what we thought, and 
other than that they\'ve basically met deadlines as planned...  How 
many gaming companies have EVER done that...

> Don is doing and so forth. I think that if T4 is going to

Yeah, get some books on the shelves...

Doubtful that Don is going to know a whole lot about what Greg is 
doing...  I don\'t really sense a problem unless Ken & Marc don\'t know 
what Greg & Don are doing...and make certain that what they are doing will 
work together well...

Actually, IG really didn\'t discuss much with us here...if you think 
about it...  They floated some of the most controversial points by 
us:  Weapons, Skill Lists, Ship Design.  They mentioned what the 
character classes were, and the skill list for the basic rulebook, and 
listened to us kick them around for a few weeks...

The other thing they did was to float their ideas for ship design by 
us, and we (or more precisely, David & Guy with input from others) 
came up with some alternatives (SSDS & QSDS).

I don\'t see much that they\'ve done wrong, or much that they\'ve done 
right for that matter...and none of us will for sure, until we see 
the rulebook in August, and the books that Don & Greg are working 
for.  

These are experienced people.  Frankly, there\'s as much talent here 
(if not more) than there was in the early days at GDW...  Let\'s see 
what they publish before we go look for a ledge to jump off of...

A neighbor of mine, who has been a rabid AD&D player for years, knows 
a few members of IG\'s staff, both in meeting/speaking with them, and 
by reputation.  When I mentioned a few of the names associated with 
this effort, he was impressed...

To be honest, the players made the game what it was the first time.  If 
they come out with a solid, mistake free rules book, we\'ll be the 
ones who carry the ball to success again.

> and the way things are going, it doesn\'t really look like

Jeez, guys...  Let\'s not panic until we see what the main rulebook 
looks like, at least...  I know that we\'re all waiting until the book 
hits the store, or (for those drooling fanboys like myself, who 
preordered) hits our mailbox.  Until then, let\'s not panic.

You have no reason to panic...  As far as we know the book is 
virtually bug free, and well written...  I have no reason to be optimistic, 
other than having been impressed by every incident in which I\'ve come in 
contact with IG\'s employees, and with the way they\'ve listened to us, 
and sought opinion where they thought it was necessary (and frankly, 
not sought opinion when they didn\'t think it was necessary).  If IG 
took every suggestion that the 500 or so members of the 2 mailing 
lists they\'d have a rulebook that approximated the size of the 
Encyclopedia Brittanica, and would be just about as readable and 
enjoyable...

On the other hand, it could be a bag of bugs that will make MT look 
like a work of art...  Until we see it, we just won\'t know... 

Frankly, I\'m not going to be all that upset even if I don\'t like the 
main rulebook.  I\'ll just take the ideas I like from the other sourcebooks, 
and incorporate them into the rules I use now (sort of a CT/MT hybrid)...

Let\'s see what happens before we panic...

Yup...of course these are the same types who often rail about RPG\'s 
in general, and Fantasy RPG\'s in general being EVIL and SATANIC...  I 
wonder how the dealer would reconcile that with his stand on Hol...

So you stick it behind the counter, and don\'t sell it to somebody 
under 18, without ID or something...  If I were looking for something 
and a shop owner (or for that matter, 1 of his employees) came off as 
moralizing about it, that would be the end of my relationship with that 
shop, regardless of his motives...  

Sadly, I don\'t think I\'ve been in a game store in about 15 years 
whose average customer was under 18...although with CCG\'s being a 
rage, I suppose it is possible...

This, however, would be a good idea...

That\'s "Space Cruiser Yamato" to you.  ;-)

I believe that Scott Kellogg may have done the stats for Battleship Yamato
(which would be the WWII incarnation of the ship), back when he did the MT
stats for all sorts of things like that.

You\'ll find that the QSDS 300-ton hull is nearly a perfect match for the
Falcon.  I worked out from a scale model that the Falcon is, in Traveller
terms, about a 300-ton ship (314, if you want to be precise).  I made it
streamlined, because the Falcon has demonstrated that it\'s quite
maneuverable in an atmosphere as well as in space.

I stressed the QSDS 300-ton hull to 4G, because that was what seemed most
reasonable at TL-10 (which is what all QSDS hulls are built at).  Remember
to install Military-standard fire control and laser turrets, and give them
enough power.

I first did the Falcon back with High Guard ... and I still have the
deckplan for it (and the matching, unmodified 300-ton trader) somewhere.

Yeah, but you have to admit that being able to conjure up demons from
hell to do your bidding is pretty satanic. Besides the fact that I like
science-fiction better than fantasy, that was one of the big reasons I
abandoned AD&D for Traveller years ago, and have never looked back.

DragonRaid, which is a distinctly Christian role-playing game

Actually guys, this makes no sense whatsoever.

If we were talking about vessels with horizontal flight control surfaces
(which is I think what leonard is talking about) then there would be a
reason for horizontal decks (that is, with decks oriented at right angles
to the direction of thrust).  But most  Traveller ships seem to use brute
force to thrust into orbit with their thruster plates.

The Scout/Courier would not exist in a vertical deck world.  The ship
would instead be shaped like a pyramid with the thrusters in the center
of the bottom of the pyramid, the control room at the top (with pivoting
pilot couches for better viewing) cargo and air/raft doors oriented
"North" and "south" at the  lowestlevel (so they can load and unload at
ground level when landed).

Maybe there\'d be an airframe scout/courier that looked more like what we
know, but that would be a different animal.

propsed games; a brief paragraph or two describing a potential new product for 
ratings purposes.  In one of the issues there was a proposal called:

Space:1889

This thing reads suspisciously like a combination of Sky Galleons of Mars and 
Ironclads & Ether Flyers.  Defintely a wargame rather than an RPG.   Was this 
the secret birth of Space 1889?  Had Frank been carrying this idea around that 
long (this magazine was from 1981).

I\'ll try to remember to bring in the issue tomorrow so I can quote the 
description and give the actual issue number and date, but I was amused/pleased 
to see that in there.  I\'ll have to look carefully to see if there are any 
other suprises in these old magazines. Maybe there\'s a proposal for something 
called Star Vikings or Pirates of the Vistula somewhere in there :-)

Diamond films are applied to blades (among other things) to improve cutting

been around for a few years now, and is becoming increasing useful.  

And you\'ve already mentioned diamond dust. <g>

        - TL*50 limit on lasers was implicitly assumed in that no weapons
which exceeded it were provided in SSDS
        - Fusion power plant minimum size below TL12 was multiplied by 10 to
fit with Marc Miller\'s vision of "no small craft or space fighters" for
anybody but the emergent TL12 Imperium
        - ContraGravity went back to the CT/MT view of providing both lift
and thrust. To ease the transition, simply assume that the FF&S design
sequence provided just enough output to counteract the weight of the ship.
Since the design rules were based on a "m3 of CG per ton displacement"
assume one ton displacement masses 15 tonnes and hence a CG system designed
per FF&S will provide 15 tonnes of thrust per ton of ship displacement. 15
was chosen instead of 14 to make the division easier to get a "m3 of CG per
tonne of thrust" table.
        - Thruster plates have returned as the standard drive mechanism.
Mass, volume, power is the same as per FF&S; price is reduced to 25% of FF&S
level

>3.  What are the most recent versions of SSDS and QSDS?

        The most recent version is the one I sent to IG plus the errata

and I don\'t have handy the list of errata

Not so secret. It was a running gag between GDW staf and SPI staff for
several years, each of us threatening to do the game. Then SPI went under,
and a few years passed, and we decided to do Space: 1889.

Could you elaborate on what you did in your campaign?  Rather than assign
skill levels to the ranks, I\'d make characters pass tests at various
difficulties to earn the ranks - until I see the T4 task system, I don\'t
know exactly how hard to make them.  Make them pass 7 or 8 skill tests at
the difficulty level to simulate the long grueling examinations.  I\'d also
throw in at having to pass (at lower difficulty levels) tests for at least
one or two other skills (taken from a short list) at before Journeyman rank
could be achieved.  And of course, they need to pass a difficult test to
actually earn the rank.

Depending on how noxious you want the guilds to be, you can charge big
bucks for the tests, require sponsorship by a current guildmember before a
character could get apprenticed, only offer tests once a year at a limited
number of locations, etc.

Depending on the culture, there might even be a morals clause "We can only
trust the care of the vital atmosphere generators to the Revered
Brotherhood..."

Having worked for the Swedish diamond-making plant (Scandiamant I

put graphite disks in a hard metal core (I seem to remember the 
graphite disks were interspersed with with nickel disks, but I can\'t

is quite impressive. ;-) Once the core is pressed, extract the core 
from it\'s holder and crush the \'ex-graphite\' to bits (one summer job 
I had, 15 years ago, was to do this manually, using a sledge, for the 
experimental process that eventually became the one they used. Yuck. 
;-). Then these graphite/diamond chunks (the smaller the better, when 
I worked in the crushing room they were put through three 
successively smaller ore crushers. By me. My back has never been the 
same after that, I don\'t know *how* many tons of diamonds I\'ve 
shifted... Or breathed for that matter, for, as the boss put it, "We 
can\'t put in air conditioning to get the dust away from you. The 
diamonds could get lost!" ;-) are boiled in a moderately hellish acid 
mixture turning it into a greyish sludge. This sludge is then 
separated into a few qualities of industrial diamonds (and excess 
graphite) on a \'shaking table\'. The excess graphite is then processed 
again to produce the lowest grade diamond, and the remaining graphite 
(which still contains some diamond) is used internally (for grinding 
stuff.)(I have here ignored the difficulties with getting rid of the 
acid in an environmentally friendly way, something which my father 
spent most of his time developing ways of doing.)

Heh. I probably still have a small can of industrial diamonds 
somewhere. ;-) (Not that I think Security would have appreciated 
knowing I took it home, but, the thought of having a can of DIAMONDS 
was just so cool to a fifteen-year old me. ;-)

You got that right. deBeers - under several names - control the 
market. (Back in the days when Sweden wasn\'t allowed to trade with 
South Africa Scandiamant was \'not\' owned by deBeers, and it did \'not\' 
get any products from SA. Except that sometime people forgot to 
re-mark the sacks certain minerals came in. (Minerals that only were 
minable in SA, at least with sufficient quality for the process used 
then. ;-)

Right. While building a diamond-plant is a sizeable material 
investment, diamond-production efficiency has gone up drastically 
over the last few years. And as for natural diamonds there is a lot 
of unused mining capacity.

I recently bought the two TNE novels. I thought they were okay novels,
but they also provide a fair bit of info about the RC, and surrounding
territory.  I thought I\'d write up a short summary of what the books
said, to help myself and hopefully other people when we try to come up
with details about the planets.  The book is also about the RCS Hornet,
and I wrote a few details about it, so I could use it as an NPC ship in
my campaign. It would be neat to come up with a little more detailed
stats on the characters, but I didn\'t have the time/inclination. Anyone
else want to try?

Hornet, a 80 year old Jayhawk Far Trader, rehabilitated by the Hiver Technical 
Academy as a class project. Outfitted with a missle launcher and a laser 
turret.  Owned by the Hiver technical nest, but registered as an RCS auxilury.
The ship has been fitted with TL-14/15 electronics.  Other nonstandard 
equipment includes a collapsable Jump-1 Fuel bladder, which retracts
when not in use to allow full use of hold. It also has a 20 ton module socket.
Later outfitted with a gattling gun, and plasma gun for close support work.
Admirality sees the Hornet as a backup to the other ships in the fleet.

Crew of the RCS Hornet

Captain Couer d\'Esprit "Red Sun"
Born on Terra in the Phoenix Arcology of Arizona in they year 1095. 
She joined Imperial Scouts in 1113. Once the Rebellion started she served 
in Lucan\'s Imperium.  She served aboard a scout cruiser attached to the Navy.
While on patrol the ship was attacked and heavily damaged by elements of the  
Solomani Navy.  Most of the command crew was killed, faced with certain 
defeat shed ordered her ship to jump, even though it was well within the 
gravity well of a gas giant.  The ship misjumped and ended up in deep
space, Couer ordered the crew in to low berths. In 1198 they were rescued 
by members of the Dawn League, only she and three other crew members survived.
She offered her services to the Dawn League and served as pilot of the 
DLS Lirgishkhunan.  She then became an instructer at the
Technical Academy.  Finally she was offered command of the RCS Hornet. 
Her hobby is painting, she designed the ship patch for the Hornet.

Scissor Hiver-Died from Fologorex II.

Newton Hiver-Replacement for Scissor.

Other NPCS in the Novels.
Vega Bwyn Norn - Born 10/II/1167. Twice decorated with Auroran citatations for
bravery. She was the pilot of the Taylor the Bruce, which was destroyed in an
encounter with several Vampires. She maintains that M Gerald, the ships\' 
Hivers tech represenative manipulated the captain into a 
confrontation with a fleet of Vampire ships. She thinks that the Hivers
were trying to draw attention to the Dawn League from the Vampires, in order
so that the Vampires would destroy the fledgling League, thus preventing
it from ever becoming a threat to the Hivers.
She resigned from the Dawn League, and became a renegade after that.  
She will try to protect the Reformation Coalition from all threats, but 
will also attempt to disrupt Hiver plans. She has no compunction against 
killing to achieve her goals. She owns a patrol Cruiser named Vi Et Armis, 
with a short range (continental) meson communicator

August Delparo President of Novastar Inc of Aubaine. Owns Lord Ryan a 200 ton
yacht.  He thinks that the RC should return to the aristocratic traditions of 
the Imperium.  

PLANETS
Ra: Ra has colony of 500 Hiver agronomists at Seabridge Nest.  
M Dina is the head of the Hivers.  The government has set up a preserve 
around Seabridge to protect Hiver larvae.  Seabridge Nest was established 
in VIII/1200 on Seabridge Peninsula, Seabridge Peninsula is 5000km from
north to south. The other major continent is named Bannon and is 16,000
km from pole to pole.  The nest is guarded by Company A of 515 Ra
Military Police. Wilburton Army Base is the closest human settlment, it
is 1500 miles away. Like most Hiver Nests Seabridge has many robots,
something which is a rarity in the RC. 
        Port Adrian is the world\'s captial and is located at the south
end of the Straits of Rickett, an 800km gap betwen the south coast of Seabridge Pen 
and North Bannon Continent. (30 deg above equater, temperate year round) 
Steam driven freighters plow the oceans (150m long) Starport is the fenced
off portion of a helioport, ocean refueling is free.
        The planet is governed by the Planetary Assembly. A governor is
also selected, the currernt one is Governor Manjit Bryce. The planet\'s
constition isn\'t real strong on civil liberites. Prisoners have no
right to a lawyer, and are often tortured.
        While the planet is fairly low tech, it does have an imported weather
satelite, and two SDBs, Asp Alpha and Asp Beta.  In addition Seabridge Nest
has a PEMS satelite in orbit.
 
Aubaine: Its Sun is named Halos.  While Transtown is the capital, Brusman
is the site of the Auction.
        The system is protected in part by a 75,000 ton Monitor, the 
ANS Kukulcan, the former Imperial Cruiser Vaward.  It\'s jump drives have 
been removed and used in smaller ships. It is the largest ship in the 
Aubaine Navy. (From the name, the size, and the text description,
the ship is most likely a Planet Class Heavy Cruiser as shown in the Rebellion
Sourcebook)
        The Tifelati, or Sea Gypsies, are an itinerant culture of the 
southern hemispher historicaly associated with banditry and mischief. 
Most other Aubaine think very little of the Tifelati, and they are often 
discriminated against.
        Aubaine hosts the HQ of the RCES:RCES Orbital Station, 
a spinning inhabited ring 500 meters across, attached by radiating spokes 
to a central dock and power plant. But it was large enough to support 1000 
workers in continuous residence. A colorful collection - consturction 
engineers undoing the damage of Virus and decades of neglect, Arses 
outfitting for the frontier, adminstrators pulling out their hair as they 
managed a patcwork comm net prone to switching errors- they made for a circus
atmosphere befitting the official call sign for the station. Big Top. 
There is still dormant Virus strains in the elevators. It is fairly stupid
becuase of the low quality of computer system, technichans are taking a go
slow attitude on the it, and are being very careful. The elevators are not
in use.

Aurora: Motto is Sic semper tyrannis. It allows psions with a permit.

Zloga: Its relic-salvage parties come from all over the Coalition. A nasty
dispute has broken out when the democratic ruling council had tried
to impose a price ceiling and excise tax on all fuel sold to starships. In
a way this was farcical the fuel was just water, conveniently stored at a 
dirt strip for occasional visitors, and only valuable becuase of its
rarity on a desert world.  But the owners of the fueling concession
were so irate that they completely demolished the "starport" and told the
ruling council where it could stuff itself for good measure.
It is protected by the RCN Fougade, one of Zloga\'s two SDBs.

Kruyter: Kreuzung Asteroid is the headquarters of Kruytercorp.  It is 300km 
in diameter. It has artificial gravity generators, but they are too expensive 
to run/maintain. The system has a ringed Gas Giant named Sonnamen. 
Two SDBs work the system. Run by raw recruits, they are employees of 
Kruytercorp. Very trigger happy.
Director Tirese Serene, is a remnant who used anagathics, and is a psion. 
Her abilities include telepathy. She has a psionic permit from Aurora. 
84 yrs old, looks in mid-twenties. Has auburn hair,and green eyes.    
Born on Nemyer (Oriflamme)

Oriflamme: Nemyer was settled about 3500 years ago during the Rule of 
Man by Terran colonists primarily Germans and Russions. They expelled the 
personal of a small Vilani outpost. They renamed the planet Nemyer after
their first governor.  The planet orbits its star in 45 days. It is not 
tidally locked. The weather is very violent due to the proximity to the star. 
Dobroye is the starport, and is located on the equater.
It has a sheltered sea harbor, and 30 million residents.  Daytime temperatures
routinely excede 60 degrees Celcius.  Access to the rest of West Zentrum
continent is tenous, blocked to the north by a dense rain forest, and to the 
south by the granite peaks of Sredinnyy Khrebet, the Central Range. 
Thron Desteufeis, the Devil\'s Throne, is a wasteland of rocks.
        Local citizens are restricted to their own region, and everyone is 
required carry ID at all times.  The economy is a command economy, strict 
controls over imports and exports are maintained.  Movement between the 
domains of technarchs is regulated, to maintain a stable labor pool.  

Phoebus: The planet is run by the Lord Regent who holds the system
while the Subsector duke is absent.  The current Lord Regent is Delvin
Garret. He lives in Stonecurtain Keep.  

Xexor: No traffic Net. A Coalition bootstrap is in Free Xantreeb, just
installed electric lights.  Pantera is a good port in Greater Xantreeb

Meadsk: Paguzim is Capital of Eitanii Republic.(Walled City) 
They speak Vilani. 

Bwan Hur: No SDB\'s, but opposed to contact. Has a working, albiet low tech,
planetary defense system.

Sauler: The system is patrolled by the SDB Springbok, run by a group of 
Starmercs known as Raglan\'s Raiders. 
The starport is a Guild free port, no weapons allowed, but no
trade regulations. Non guild members are not allowed to use all the facilities
and are pressured to join the Guild. Sauler Starport Cooperative is the front
company for the guild. The Kingdom of Serritella is to the north,
and Kaline Empire to the south. Starport Authority is housed in a large
building from the 2nd Imperium. Slave Auctions are run by the Guild.

Mexit: A small world, .7 G, about the size of Mars. Its orbital period is
48 standard days. Very violent weather.  Church of Grace and Light is very
strong.  It arose on Mexit several thousand years ago.  The faithful await 
the return of the Lord Defender.  He returns when ever the planet is in a
deep crisis.  The faithful believe that Saint Kilalt will rise again to 
herald the return of the Defender. 
     It has a single small moon, diameter of 500 km, named Elojo. Soledad is 
the captial of the planet. Emperor Brak is the local TED, overthrown with 
help from the Hornet, a temporary government is put in power Cardinal Miranda 
Vazquez. 
   Locals are afraid of nightjacks, mythical monsters which prey on those
who wander into the wilderness.  The locals ward themselves with blessed
items.  In actuallity they are virus infected robots.  Before the collapse 
Kilalt, a foreward looking priest had set up a depot of high technology to 
help bring back civilization.  His assistant murdered him, and took his place.
While he was asleep in cold sleep, Virus infected the complex.  The robots
didn\'t know that the Virus was responsible, and thought the Defender was
responsible.   The usurper planned on waiting till contacted by interstellar
government, and then selling the weapons located in the depot.  The depot
is protected by several deep meson guns, and numerous robots.  Graylord
is the chief robot. He was originally a repository for legal and ecclesiastic 
lore.  
   Soledad army has 20 troopers in heavy battle dress, a dozen Pyrrhus grav
sleds, five Astrin APCs, and two heavy TL-15 tanks.  

MISC:
Marathon Victrix is captained by Yves Franchot "Ripclaw". Class of \'97

Hiver Folgorex I, was a biological weapon designed by K\'Kree. Solomani 
reengineered it into Fologorex II, a much more deadly variety.

Hmm.  Well, I\'ll submit whatever I come up with (which will be something

Well, you could rank your Purser as Castellan, your Engineer as Artificer.
Officer ranks, presumably Squire, Knight, Earl, Duke although that could clash

He\'s referring to the <something-or-other> Stock Light Freighter, 
of which the Millenium Falcon was a *heavily* modified specimen. 
The Light Freighter is the Star Wars equivalent of the Far Trader 
or Type R Merchant...

Good point.  

Let\'s see now...once T4 gets into my hands, I\'ll have no less than eight 
projects to get done immediately.  No problem! :)  At least that means 
that no matter what my mood, there\'ll be a system to work on. :)

Fred,

Sure, you could go through all the work of getting a group together, _or_ 
you could do as some comic enthisasts I\'ve known and simply buy all the 
T4 materials (in duplicate or triplicate, of course), and immediately put 
them all in acid-free bags, never opening (let alone using) the books. :)

Doesn\'t that sound _much_ more appealing? :)  It\'d be simpler, anyway. :P

recently a discussion regarding Heinlein\'s "Starship Troopers"
on this list, I figured some of you might like to know that
Hollywood intends to "update" it for the 90s.

Starship Troopers: The Movie, is due out in theaters in the
summer of \'97, at least according to the 12-Aug-96 issue of
Newsweek, pp63-64. The short blurb they write about it doesn\'t
even mention "Heinlein", which I found annoying, but even more
dismal was the director\'s comment that "the movie is about
fighting giant bugs", seven-foot tall alien spiders to be exact.
In the first place, Heinlein\'s classic novel "Starship Troopers"
was about much more than "fighting giant bugs," and in the second
place, the best part of the book, IMHO, was while the protagonist
was still suffering through boot. The director, Verhoeven, is
best known for his work in Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct,
and Showgirls, and according to recent reports, the special
effects to be used in Starship Troopers have brought its budget
up near the $100 million mark. Let us hope the studio\'s take on
Heinlein\'s novel preserves some semblance of story amidst the
Hollywood glitz with which we will, no doubt, be bombarded.

as they were posted on my web site. Unfortunately, I\'m missing a 3-day chunk
out of my email archive, and I KNOW there was at least one more, having to
do with (I think) fuel consumption.

In the weapon section, under laser bays, the table labelled "50 displacement
ton Laser Bays," in the text just above the actual table it says "The rate
of fire of any turret ..." This should read "The rate of fire of any bay ..."

In the controls and electronics section, the Military package is described
as having "1x 120,000km PEMS folding array (reminder that it can\'t be used
while maneuvering)," but should read "2x 120,000km PEMS folding array (ship
can\'t accelerate while deployed)"

        The Life Support section has no description of the difference
between Basic and Standard life support. Suggest the following:

"Basic Life Support provides a sealed hull, air and water, and is intended
for short periods of time (up to about eight hours). Standard Life Support
provides the same, and adds waste disposal or recycling and food, and is
designed for up to four weeks. Either form of life support has quite a bit
of safety margin built in, and can be stretched to double its intended load
for twice as long."

Under weapons, the explanation of choosing a meson screen is apparently
unclear. It currently reads "Choose the protective value you want, then find
it in the chart under your ship size category." Suggest it be changed to
read "Choose a meson screen from the chart. In the column under the ship
size category for your hull, note the protective value that screen provides."

In the controls and electronics section, the Military package is described
as having "1x 300,000km LaserComm (for controlling missiles)." That one
should read "2x" as well.

Under Jump Drives, the paragraph reading 

        "On the Jump Drive Size table, find the ship\'s size, 
        then go across to the column under the required jump 
        number. This is the volume the jump drive requires. 
        Also listed is the price and mass. Calculate the surface 
        area the drive requires by dividing its volume by 3."

The last sentence "Calculate the surface area ..." can be deleted, as the
tables I submitted include the area in the table.

On the sample ship worksheet, somebody commented about rearranging the order
of the crew columns: 

>Additionally, the Crew columns should be modified, since all of the tables
>list tend to list them in the order of Gn, El, En, Mx, Fl (weaponry,

It is my understanding (a good friend of mine worked on the effects)
that the movie will concentrate on the *action* of the story rather
than the politics, etc..  Other than drop-troops and bugs, I
wouldn\'t expect too much of the book to be in there.  I would
suggest going to see it with that in mind, lest you be too
disappointed :-)

Geez.  If the author had been Danielle Steele, they\'d have mentioned her 
name.  But a sci-fi author?  Heaven forbid!

Right.  The story, like most of his juveniles, is one of the maturation 
process.  The character grew and changed during the course of the book.  
The book was also a social commentary, espousing the idea that only those 
who have "earned it" should be allowed to exercise their franchise (ie, 
vote).  

Undoubtedly, all of this will be lost in an orgy of special effects, 
grunting "heros" and gore.

Sigh.

One can only hope they do preserve at least a bit of the original novel 
beyond the typical Hollywood fare.  But I doubt it.

I\'m trying to run games and let other folks do as much developing as

Yep. It was a "coming of age" book like most of RAH\'s juvies with a good
dose of social commentary..like most of RAH\'s books. <g>  

But what can you expect from Hollywood?  If you can\'t shoot it, blow it up
or have sex with it they aren\'t interested.

I was quoting Wildstar who wrote that he had designed the Falcon *and* a

I was a cynic yesterday, so today I\'ll have to be an optimist. <g>

The silver lining is that if the movie is good enough to be a box office
success there will be a new reprint of the book.  Maybe some of the younger
movie goers will discover Heinlein.  I\'m pretty sure if we can get RAH\'s
books into their hands they\'ll enjoy them, want more, and...

More SF fans, more potential Traveller players. <g>

        Simple method of manufacturing small diamonds or diamond dust
        is the Butler method, where a hot piece of metal is bathed
        in methane gas. The heat of glowing metal apparently breaks
        down the molecular bonds between hydrogen and carbon, and
        the free carbon crystallized on the surface of metal as thin
        diamond layer.
 
> And diamond-dust coated sharpening rods are a standard fixture 
> in cutlery stores... I own a pair myself.

        Hmm. I prefer flat sapphirite stone to diamond-dust rods. I
        found it difficult to control the shape of bladetip when
        using rod sharpeners. For rough honing I use a flat tungsten
        plate with butlerized diamond scale at upper surface.

        The diamond scale appears to be able to cut nearly anything,
        but removed material quickly fill the scale, and so the
        honing tool requires frequent cleaning.

> We don\'t use diamond as a cutting edge because it is *brittle*. A

> blows.

        The same problem plaques modern ceramic knifes. The ceramic
        blade stays sharp very long, but when dull it is very difficult
        to sharpen one, and the blade may shatter when dropped.


        Some modern electric and optic equipments are made of such
        artificial materials that are inferior to existing rare and
        expensive materials. If rare materials suddenly became cheap
        and readily available, we would probably see some increases
        in performance in some areas of technology.

Speaking of doing 900 things at once, I want to mention that I\'ll be at 
Gen-Con on Friday, Saturday and Sunday [couldn\'t get Thursday 
off...grumble, grumble].  Although I live close enough to travel to 
Milwaukee daily (and therefore I\'ll be home each evening), I don\'t plan 
on doing much posting during that time.  Most replies will probably have 
to wait until Sunday or Monday.  I will, however, give my comments on T4 
if I happen to get the book at Gen-Con.

Dig out GURPS Lensman and look up the "Space Opera Combat System" 
(SOCS).  It\'s an RSSC designed with an emphasis on furthering the 
story, rather than the usual wargaming emphasis.

Only trouble is, that makes it *impossible* to move to a different
"station" while under acceleration. And it makes damage control next to
impossible. The ship\'s corridors become the equivalent of an open
elevator shaft in a *tall* building. Anybody near the bow end of a
corridor when the compensators go out will be rather messily dead.

Also, consider just how much bracing those chairs will need. They will
be anchored to a *wall* with 100 kg of person in them. At 3 gees that\'s
gonna take some *real* work to design the chair not to rip out. 

It\'s a lot simpler to have a chair attached to a *floor* that *stays* a
floor, and has an option to recline (complete with swing down controls).

Only if you are doing high gee manuevers. I don\'t have references at
hand, but I seem to remember the Type S as only being 2 gee anyway.

Call the hull "airframe", and you *fly* the damn thing until you are
too high/fast to worry about the atmosphere, and then stand it on it\'s
tail and boost into orbit. Once you\'ve achieved orbit, you can loaf out
to the 100 diameter limit.

Landing would be a lot like landing the Shuttle, except you have engine
power available so, you don\'t have to make a dead stick landing.

It reminds *me* that I\'ve got a copy of Outreach in storage. The entire
Imperium (plus everything else except maybe the Zhodani core
expeditions) will fit in *one* of the hexes on the galaxy map from that

I won\'t be holding my breath. I expect that they\'ll employ someone
like Alan Dean Foster to knock out a swift novelisation. This will
probably be along the same lines as Terry Bisson\'s _Johnny Mnemonic_
or the dreadful novelisation of _Dracula_ that was released to
coincide with Francis Ford Coppola\'s _Bram Stoker\'s Dracula_.

Even PKD didn\'t escape this fate, despite the reissue of a
merely-renamed _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_; the cinema
release of _Total Recall_ brought with it a novelisation that had
little in common with _We Can Remember It For You Wholesale_ bar the
language it was written in.

Well, as the person who brought up the deck orientation question 
again, I\'ll point out that there is an implicit assumption that 
Imperial hardware is reliable.  Maybe not quite up to Fail-Safe 
standards (cf. Larry Niven, Known Space), but reliable enough. 
For CIVILIAN ships, the risk of Anti-Acc systems failing is  
probably so trivial as not to be worth worrying about, and  
parallel decks not unreasonable.   
 
I was just pointing out the safety hazard *if*, "God forbid", 
your Anti-Acc should fail in a ship like the Type S or Type R 
while under acceleration.  This sort of thing shouldn\'t happen 
ordinarily, but we all know that adventures arise from the 
out-of-the-ordinary things that happen. 
 
BIG CAVEAT: *Military* ships, which are subject to having holes 
shot in them, are a whole \'nother story.  I also pointed this out 
in the original post, but to repeat: having holes shot thru your 
Anti-Acc systems, or the Power Plant that feeds juice to said 
systems does terrible things to the reliability of your Anti-acc. 
A WELL-DESIGNED military ship should be designed to minimize 
losses in the event of systems failures of various types...

Hey, the physics nullifier here is grav comp, and if it breaks down
on a given ship, the same ole physics we know and love *will* apply.

As a result it is prefectly reasonable to call vertical decked ships
more "realistic" in situations where the grav comp might be damaged.
A good reason for things like the type R is that they are impossible
to hijack unless they gain the bridge at the very start, otherwise
turn off the grav comp and turn on the Mdrive.  Splat!

In my campaign I have a team that has been working missions for the RC (and
will for a few weeks more until T4 w/ background is released.) One of the
PCs spent years in school after a short stint in the Balduri Navy. Now they
have their own ship and my once upon a navy guy thinks all he learned back
when should be just as applicable today. To throw him a wrench and get my
NPC team aboard I had the RC set minimum crew regulations for different
class ships. The ship\'s owner, fresh out of the navy has his pilot\'s and
astrogator\'s papers. Other members of the crew have skills needed to secure
cargo with near certainty of profit and the combined skill and manpower to
do the hours and hours and hours of maintenance to keep a 138 year old free
trader operating somewhat effecently.

The "Engineers\' Guild" was created to keep some of the control in my hands.
No matter what the PCs skill it is years old and the guild is fairly young.
The guild requires months as an apprentice with an "Master Engineer" before
Journeyman papers are awarded. A journeyman can then crew as ship\'s engineer.

So my PC team had to hire on a master and now the old man who once was an
engineer pulls grunt duty on the plant and engines in addition to his other
duties.

Mainly I am looking for what ideas for general interstellar trade regulation
others have come up with.

Why not just go over the top and say that the Jump Number is the number of hexes

Yep, the _Starburst_ is an SEH cruiser -- the silhouette leaves no doubt.
They call MT\'s _Planet_ a _Mercury_, as I recall, but the silhouette makes
this clear also, since the _Planet_ is just a heavy _Starburst_.

The _Rapier_ is an ED-15, I believe, from MT _Frightning...er, _Fighting
Ships_.  I don\'t have that dread tome, but the ED is an "escort destroyer"
in the 10000 d-ton class which is probably intended to, well, destroy
escorts.  It\'s natural prey is probably any escorts up to and including
5000 d-ton fleet escorts like the _PF Sloan_, which are big enough to be 
a serious nuisance.  It\'d be handy to have one to deal with the RCN ships.

Speaking of the dread tome...  It\'s an oversized flying pizza wedge 
weighing in at 10,000 tons.  Thanks.

I\'ve never really though as the Planet as being an upsized SEH...  They 
look so different.  I think that what you\'re looking at is the SEH on the 
side of the Planet picture, the Planet is that thing in the foreground 
that looks like a shuttle, that\'s a particle accellerator in the middle 
not a docking ring.  There\'s another...  oops looking at the picture now
The SEH is the ship on the extreme right of the picture the big thing in 
the upper left is a Planet...  They never should have put the two ships 
in one shot...

No, no, Doug, it\'s worse than that.  Far worse.  I have been visited by 
foul omens indeed, terrible portents, dark forms from beyond, whispering

Since Aliens 1, 2, and 3 made money, we\'re going to be seeing big spidery
slightly out of focus aliens wandering menacingly through Geiger sets amid
clouds of Ridley Scott-brand steam for a very, very, VERY long time.

Actually, you need a black or at least chicano actor to play Juan. His
skin color *is* referred to *once* in the book. And I rather suspect
that they could find some good actors for the part.

That would work. How about making Scharzenagger Sgt. Zim? *That* role
he\'d work quite well at.

And it *is* possible that they will keep the boot camp stuff, and even
do it more or less right. That fits pretty well with the sort of stuff
they do in "military" movies these days.

Dave covered these pretty well.  The executive summary is that laser power
was limited; thrust plates are back as standard technology (and cheaper),
and fusion power minimums were raised to support milleu 0.  The change to
contra-gravity is minor (allowing you to get thrust from it, too).

> 3.  What are the most recent versions of SSDS and QSDS?

The most recent version of QSDS is v1.3, and it\'s on my Web site at
	http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds
When new versions are available (there will almost certainly be a v1.4,
unless IG tells me to cease and desist) the will appear on the same site.

> 4.  What are the "known errors" in QSDS and SSDS?

There are two known problems with QSDS v1.3:
1) The power plant table gives fuel requirents for 6 months, instead of the
   FF&S/SSDS standard of 1 year.
2) The HEPlaR drive table is completely wrong with respect to the input
   power required by HEPlaR drives.  The power requirement should be 14
   times the listed amount (it\'s a displacement-ton versus cubic-meter
   conversion error in my spreadsheet).

> 5.  What are the fixes for the known errors?

See above.  When T4 arrives, I\'ll compare QSDS 1.4 with what was printed,
and produce a definitive errata list.

I can\'t promise to answer promptly, but questions that are e-mailed to me
(instead of appearing in the TML, which I sometimes read and sometimes just
delete without reading) _will_ get answered, sooner or later.

Well, I did some digging.  The unmodified ship\'s deckplan seems to be lost
and gone forever (and I _know_ I did it) - oh well.  I did find two versions
of the Falcon (one at TL-12 and the other at TL-15), as well as a bunch of
other ships.

The problem with the deckplans is that they\'re 11x17 and were drawn in
color (buying Azhanti High Lightning had a big influence on the way I drew
deckplans forever afterwards); I don\'t have a scanner that can handle that.
I\'ll be posting the High Guard designs in a little while, though.

If folks are interested, there is some other material there, including a new
and different weapons list for folks who were usign the original STRIKER.

This is Hollywood we\'re talking about, we\'re just as likely to get Jackie

Oh, yes. plus, the floors double as bulkheads. no need to build quite as 
many extra.

big guns? I don\'t play traveller to fantasize about selling fertilizer

Yes.  It was the first time I had ever played a Sci-Fi game.  Before that
it was just wargames.  We got into Traveller shortly after that.  I seem
to recall winning that first game - I was the bugs - although I didn\'t
fully know what I was doing.  Wish I still had access to the game. Our

I opted against testing. To easy to breeze in at testing time and sweep all
the catagories one desires. This PC is a real "What\'s Zathra, the NPC\'s,
engineering skill?" type. Or perhaps "How do I get my pilot, navigator,
engineer, cargomaster, purple gumroot wine rating papers?"

So the authority (RC in this case) established minimum crewing requirements
by starship class. The Bucephylus requires a qualified pilot with fairly
easily gotten Pilots Papers, a navigator with similar requirements and
because of the influence of the "Engineers\' Guild" the difficult to obtain
journeyman or master engineer depending on the age a complexity of ship\'s
systems.

So, tying two threads together...Guilds and Starship Troopers...

Take a gander at RAH\'s "Starman Jones" (still a favorite after all these
years). Just about every career was run by a guild--with tough entry
procedures. The main character, Max Jones, hoped to be a Astrogator on a
starship. When he approaches the Guild about joining, he thought that he
would be able to get in as his uncle had been an Astrogator and you need to
be sponsored for membership by a relative. Turns out his uncle never got
around to it, and thereby hangs the tale of the rest of the book.

If you ignore the occasional anachronism (circular slide rules, the ship\'s
computer is possibly mechanical--definately "low tek"), it\'s a great book,
especially for young adults (the intended audience).

One example is the article by Marc Miller about Luna.  One of the
lunar communities held in its\' atmosphere with a gravitic dome that
had been in continuous operation since the middle of the Long Night,
as I recall.  Darrian had an underwater city that had a similar
structure, which survived the Maghiz (partly becuase it was under
water and ice).  There are many flying cities and grav-supported
buildings in the Imperium.  The implication is that gravitics must
be very, very reliable, even if the cities use redundant layers of
multiple units to avoid catastrophic failure.

Maybe so, but I get real tired of watching people rip each other, 
because somehow they\'re prescient to the point that they know exactly 
what technology is going to look like 3000 years from now...when 
they really don\'t have any idea what its going to look like 100 years 
from now.  We\'ve done things in the last 25 years that my grandfather 
is amazed by.  We have no clue what things will be like 3000 years 
from now...

Facts are none of us have a clue...  We might try showing a little 
more respect for 1 another\'s ideas...

Not likely, in this day and age...  Unless of course, Juan Rico

I was figuring R. Lee Ermey as Fleet Sergeant Zim.  Daisy Fuentes as Carmen.   
Edward James Olmos as Juan Rico\'s father.  As for Juan Rico; I would say Lou 
Diamond Phillips.

Picard as Mr DuBios?  I like that...

Yup...  Here we are, e-mailing each other back and forth, on our 14.4

Probably restart it -- of course, any reference to maneuver drives,
planetary invasions and defense, war strategy, or any other related topic
seems to restart it.  Heck, sheer random Brownian motion seems to restart
it. :)

Yes!  A very, very good game, perhaps handicapped by what must surely
qualify as the ugliest board ever developed by the gaming industry. 
"Smeared antipasto" was my favorite description -- from Fire & Movement, I
think.  I thought they did a really good job of capturing the \'feel\' of
combat in Heinlein\'s novel.  There was also a steady stream of extensions
and variant rules in The General and elsewhere, mostly intriguing and
useful.  One big problem was that a few Bug strategies, clearly not
anticipated by the game designers, tended to unbalance the game -- notably
the \'protected breach\' trick in \'into the tunnels\' scenarios.

Actually, I play traveller to fantasize about *smuggling* little guns
*inside* the fertilizer...planet-to planet.  <g> 

Give me a Far Trader with a sandcaster and a pulse laser that the gunner
has to whack with a wrench to get to fire, a jump drive older than the
combined age of the crew and just as cranky as you\'d expect, a cargo hole
filled with speculative trade goods that cost the crew every credit they
could scrape together, and a handful of mysterious passengers that you just
know aren\'t what they claim to be...ah yes!  Now *that\'s* a game!

Honestly, there are lots of us that aren\'t into ship to ship combat at all. 
Joe\'s Ridiculously Simple Ship Combat system will probably do *me* just
fine.  I like playing in (and GMing) trading games, exploration games,
games of intrigue..spy-counterspy stuff, and games that focus on
roleplaying.

Hee, why don\'t you do it the way I did in a game last year.  PC\'s had to
sit for Boards (exams) to move up in rank, and there were strict regs about
what each rank was allowed to do.  The PC\'s
actually had to roleplay Guild politics. <g>

To move up in rank they had to:

  1.  Complete X number of years at their current rank in a
      particular departmental function, ie.  Engineering,
      Astrogation, Piloting, etc.  Jumping around from department to
      department hurts the PC\'s chances of advancement..even if it
      does make her more well rounded.  <g>
  
  2.  Have a letter of recommendation from their most recent
      superior.  Sure you *hate* the old fart, but if you can\'t get
      on his good side, you\'re screwed! <g>
      
  3.  Sit for a single Board at a time.  So what if you\'re qualified
      to sit for 3 or 4 Boards, you can\'t do it.  Just let somebody
      catch you trying to sneak from the Pilot\'s Board to the
      Astrogator\'s Board!  If they do, you lose *all* your Papers!
  
Boards were held once or twice a year at specific locations, and they
*aren\'t* well publicized.  <g> Even if a PC was qualified to take the
Board, he had to be in the right place and the right time. AND politics on
the grading was always rearing its ugly head.  <g>

A PC might *really* be qualified to be Chief Enginner, but without Papers
they wouldn\'t find a job within the Empire.  The shipmaster would have to
hire a Papered Chief to fly!  Who would actually do the work was a
different story.  <g>

Actually, circular slide rules are *more* convenient than a calculator
for some operations.

And the computer is indeed electronic. A mechanical computer wouldn\'t
have used binary.

What we have there is a glimpse of a period of computer history you
don\'t hear much about. The computer is semi-dedicated (much like Eniac)
to doing math calculations. And they haven\'t invented *assemblers* yet!
So you enter your programs in machine language, then toggle in the data
in binary.

That\'s one of the worlds I\'d visit if I had the ability to visit
alternate universes. I\'d be able to make a *large* fortune by patenting
assemblers, compilers, high level languages, etc. Patenting more
reasonable i/o devices would make money too. :-)

Uneccesary. Most Heinlein *never* goes out of print except while
negotiations on buying rights from the current owner are going on. Baen
Books is reprinting a lot of the stuff right now.

>  Anyone remember the Avalon Hill boardgame Starship Troopers?

Yep. And if there was a computer version (It\'s been a *long* time) then
that\'s sitting in storage with the rest of my AH computer games.

Well, in Battle Rider they\'re given the same external profile, 
with just a size difference. 
 
Just to add to the fun, that configuration first appeared 
as the Ghalalk-class 50,000-ton armored cruiser from  
Supplement 9:Fighting Ships, so that makes at least 
_three_ classes with that profile. 
 
It\'s tempting to design matching close escorts and 
fighters. :)

Perhaps the Imperial Starship Design Bureau lost something in the suffle. 

"Here\'s the design spec\'s for the SEH and the Planet."

"Ummmm... You know these both look the same..."

"Precisely, that way we confuse all those alien bastards out there into 
thinking we have hundreds of Planets when infact we only have two and 
lots of SEH\'s."

"But the deckplan layouts are different."

"All right I spilled coffee on the original exterior for the SEH, no one 
will ever know about this but us though."

Maybe that\'s what happened.  Then again maybe there\'s a shipsboat, 
fighter, freighter, SDB and battlerider all based on the same silouette.

It did keep to the plot and feel of the novel, but, as you say, 
it was somehow a bit mediocre.  Donald Sutherland made a *great* 
"Old Man"!

I\'ve been re-reading them recently, but I survived my late adolescence 
on Heinlein, Doc Smith and Andre Norton.

They\'d never get it the point, they\'d just ruin it.  As for 
other movies, I believe that "Destination Moon" is (very loosely) 
based on "Rocketship Galileo".

Funny, ever since I heard about "Starship Troopers", I\'ve been thinking 
that "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" would make a kick-ass scifi movie.

It\'s not a matter of being out of print, exactly.  Jane Austin is never out
of print either, but with the raft of movies based on her works lately
there have been special editions tying in with the movies, and I\'m *sure*
there have been many people to discover her through those movies and the
editions of her books they spawned.

Bought it, played it, stored it away somewhere.  Not AH\'s best effort, IMO.

As you know by now,the books arrived today...but only the softbound 
edition. :(  Hardbounds come in tomorrow.  

I got a softbound edition.  For the most part, I\'ve only looked through 
it.  It looks like most of it was taken right out of The Traveller Book, 
word for word.  Then they changed it as needed.  

The only section I\'ve read in-depth is the short (2-page) Task System 
chapter.  There are no errors of logic that I could find in it (after 
only reading it once), and no spelling errors.  BUT, there were tons and 
tons of grammatical errors.  Things like using plural words when a 
singular was called for (ie, adding an \'s\' to a noun unnecessarily), and 
stuff like that.  It doesn\'t make it unintelligible.  It just looks sloppy.

Oh, and those looking for a Rediculously Simple Ship Combat System from 
me are going to be disappointed.  Today I played a great starship combat 
system, called "Traveller Starship Combat System" appropriately enough, 
and administered by David Golden.  Although it is in Alpha testing right 
now, it will clearly be a simple, exciting system to use.  Sadly, it 
isn\'t due out until 1997. :(  But, I\'m having fun playing it at Gen-Con.  
I\'ve got my tickets for one of the games tomorrow as well. :)

Met with Marc Miller and Ken Whitman at the seminar.  The seminar 
consisted entirely of questions and answers.  It was quite worth the 
time.  They discussed a lot of things we TMLers already know, but hearing 
the philosophy of Traveller stated by Marc Miller in person is 
heartening.  

Also, Marc and Ken outlined their plans to set up product demonstrations 
in game stores in order to attract customers.  They also asked that 
Traveller referees try running a game or two in the local store, if space 
is available for that.  

Welp, what I\'ve written probably isn\'t very clear, and it certainly is 
incomplete, but I\'m pretty excited, so I\'m babbling. :)  Just let me 
summarize:  

1)  Gen-Con is a load of fun.

2)  Imperium Games\' "Marc Miller\'s Traveller Starship Battles" is /the/ 
game for those who want quick and fun space combat.

3)  T4 is out, and it looks good.  Very playable, relying heavily on The 
Traveler Book for source material (Exit Visa is in there, most of the 
introduction to Traveller and referee\'s introduction to Traveller 
sections are straight out of The Traveller book, etc.).  The skills, 
characters, and starships sections are exactly what we\'ve been told they 
would be.  

That\'s it for now...

under the T4 rule system was create a character.  All went well until I 
got to the mustering out stage.  Then, I discovered an error..which led 
to other errors.  Here they are:

1)  The mustering out rules have the old rules for the number of throws 
you get to add based on rank.  That is, rank 1-2 adds one die, 3-4 adds 2 
dice, and 5-6 adds 3 dice, and you get +1 on your rolls.  The problem is 
that the ranks used are not 1-6, but E1-E9,O1-Ox (where x is anywhere 
from 7 to 10).  How do you translate these ranks into the old 1-6 ranking?

2)  The Merchant Captain Alexander Jamison example uses the Navy ranks, 
not the Merchant ranks.

3)  The book confusingly switches between "years" and "terms" in 
discussing the character generation process.  Perhaps this isn\'t an 
error, but simply a lack of understanding on my part. It\'s my first time 
through it, after all. 

Has anyone puzzled any of this out yet?

Though has just occured as I travelled along the East West Connector 
heading to my favorate hobby store.

Given that in FF&S and I\'d imagine in SSDS and QSDS that both a low berth 
and a bunk both displace 14 cubic meters and that at small stateroom and 
an emergency lowberth for 4 displace 28 cubic meters.  Would it not be 
advantageous to the longterm survival of the crew in emergency situations 
to replace standard small cabins with two low berths, bunks with a single 
low berth and large cabins with four low berths?

Surely a low berth, capable of sustaining human life in suspended 
animation for years could be left open and used as a bunk, if you assume 
that the wires and hoses can be retracted into containers on the side and 
the clear lid could be rolled back into the wall, why couldn\'t you use it 
as a bunk, sure it\'d be like sleeping in a coffin, but given the 
alternative of ending up in a coffin or sleeping in one, I\'d rather take 
the nap...

Granted the power requirements and such are higher, but if you assume 
that it\'s possible to stack low berths like bunkbeds surely you could fit 
two low berths into the area of a small cabin with enough room left over 
for a head and shower combination (fresher for lack of a better term).  
This allows for the increased survivability of individual mission members 
on smaller vessels ie. 100 ton scout.

For example, Jimmy Big Bootie is mortally wounded on an away mission but 
is returned to the ship still alive, if this ship is a 400 ton fat trader 
with standard low berths Jimmy is in good shape.  However, if Jimmy\'s 
ship is an S-Class Scout Jimmy\'s toast.  0% chance of survival if there\'s 
no medical surgeon on the ship and with a crew of 4 what are the odds of 
that?  Slim and None and Slim just left town...  If Jimmy\'s ship had 
converted their bunks over to low berths everyone would have a chance for 
survival.

Am I making any sence here or is this just hooie?  Excuse me sir but if 
you don\'t mind me saying but isn\'t that a lot of Hooie?

To respond to your question, no sending \'stuff\' to the mailing lists does
not count as publishing.  You may post your future JTAS article on say the
X-boat or Traveller Digest and get feedback from all of the awesome
TRAVELLER fans there-in, especially since until you actually submit the

the whole idea behind the Disclaimer form is that you are selling your work

Absolutely,for the purposes of feedback we highly encourage you to post
your future article on the mailing lists.  It gives you a better idea of
how your article looks through someone elses eyes.  They may find a
mistake, or perhaps make a suggestion that would have otherwise gone
unnoticed.

IMPORTANT to note, is that while your future article is not yet Imperium

curious where he got the idea for dividing up syllables into C VC CVC and 
differentuating between groups of sounds that occur initially, finally, and 
so on, and the idea that there is a proportion for the occurance of certain 
syllable types (he lists the proportion for Vilani V, CV, VC, CVC as 
1:4:3:2).

I am a student of linguistics and a language teacher, and I realize that a 
lot of this comes from phonetics and so on.  What I really want to know is 
what books he used as a reference for this information.  I assume these 
references he used gave this kind of information for real world languages, 
and I\'d like to see it.  I\'m also curious as to what the Traveller word 
generation table for English would look like.  I plan to use this 
information for creating and generating minor languages in Traveller as well 
as other RPGs.

Can anybody help?

That makes sense to me, but then I don\'t know the exact specifications of 
a low berth.  But if the design of the berth allows for such usage, it 
would certainly be reasonable to do as you suggest.  I\'d say it would be 
especially popular on the small ships, like Far Traders and whatnot.

The PC\'s in  my PBEM game are soon to meet natives of a desert world who
make Herbert\'s Fremen look like pansies.  The routinely render captives
for water after a ritual strangulation, and have been known to take on and
beat higher tech, larger forces routinely.

And knowing this, they STILL want to go, go figure.

	Well, since you asked, yes it is a lot of hooie.  The bunk 
includes space for a head, common areas, a place to eat, a chair, 
probably some kind of entertainment console, space to store your 
clothes, etc.  Granted, it\'s a bunk, so there\'s not a _lot_ of room for 
these things, but they\'re there.  The low berth on the other hand takes 
up almost all of that 14m^3 with machinery with just enough left over for 
access space and a place to lie down.  That means if you replace bunks 
with low berths everyone has to keep their clothes and personal effects 
in the cargo hold, eat with their food in their lap and their legs 
hanging over the side of the low berth, and dispose of human waste by 
throwing it out an airlock.

The low berth can\'t take up 14m^3 of space because a 4 man low berth can 
be cramed into 28m^3.  Obviously a 2 man low berth could be crammed into 
far less that 28m^3 and if you organized your low berths like bunk beds 
lets face it no one, not even me at 6\'8", needs a bed thats 4 meters 
(13.5 feet) long, although it would be nice...

Waste disposal and such is covered under life support so I don\'t see that 
as a problem, plus I\'m willing to budget extra space for that if enough 
people feel that it\'s a problem.

Even during normal ship construction there\'s really no rules for 
budgeting ship\'s common space, it just sort of appears as we see fit when 
we\'re putting down the deck plans.  I know I\'ve never designed a ship 
thinking, well I\'ve got to bugets 20m^3 so there\'s a dining room on this 
ship, heck  no 20m^3 is always cargo/fuel/electronics or weapons.

Even if you assume that the bunks take up all 28m^3 for a four man 
lowberth, that\'s technically 2 men more than you could fit into a single 
small stateroom of equal size, if you budget an extra 14m^3 for a head 
that still leaves you with an extra 14m^3 to get back to where you would 
have been in the first place with 2 smalls staterooms.  I\'m sure that the 
crew on a sub sleeps more than 4 men per 28m^3.

Using the above example if you had a crew of 16, I like easy math for 
examples, that\'d mean you\'d need 4, 4 man low berths for sleeping areas 
you\'d could probably get away with cutting the number of head\'s in half, 
I\'m assuming this is a military boat not a passanger ship, thus you\'ve 
already displaced (28x4)+(2x14) or 140m^3, if you were to budget the room 
for small staterooms for all of this you\'d have (28x8) or 224m^3 budgeted 
thus leaving yourself with (224-140) or 84m^3 for common areas.  That\'s 6 
displacement tons or six hexes on your deckplans or an area 6mx4m 
(19.8 feet x 13.2 feet).  Space for common area that you would never have 
had in the first place.

I\'m hoping that this explains my theory a little more clearly than I did 
last night.

I don\'t think you could simply substitute a low berth for a bunk or two 
for a small stateroom.  Part of the space allocated for bunks, and 
especially for small staterooms is for plumbing. closets, perhaps some 
minimal amount of furniture...  I would assume the the 14 m3 for a low 
berth includes the low berth, and space for access, and little else.

However, I can see a few ways around this.

1) The least inconvenient for Type S Scouts and Far Traders would be to
simply change each crew cabin from 4 to 3.5 tons and to use the extra space
for an emergency low berth.  On a Scout ship this is perfect, instead of
4, 4 ton cabins you have 4, 3.5 ton cabins and one ELB. 

2) Another, somewhat less comfortable way to go is to convert half the
space in each small stateroom into a low berth which can be slept in.  You
get one per small stateroom and 2 per large.  Things would be a little more
cramped, but still habitable, and everyone would have their own low berth. 

Option 1 sounds a whole lot more comfy to me, but the disadvantage of an 
ELB is that if two folks are hurt or killed at different time you have to 
thaw out the first poor sucker to put the 2nd one in, so it likely evens 
out.  I would expect a number ships on the fringe to use one or the other 
of these options fairly often, good thought. 

Heck, even converting one ton of cargo space into a single low berth would
greatly increase the odds of survival of the crew. 


Good idea.

Comments?

_Arcane_#10 popped through my letterbox this morning. It includes a 
6-page feature on the history of Traveller + interview with MM, and a 
4-page review of T4 (they give it 9/10). The artwork looks very nice, 
but I was disappointed to read that IG decided not to drop the \'half

system (hopefully there\'ll be a Book 4/5/6/7 equivalent to follow).

Another option is to write (or obtain) a program that creates a probability

the Macintosh.  In fact, I\'m now ready for beta testing.

Metator (not the earlier application, which I\'ve renamed) generates - or
expands from basic UWP - a complete system.  The system can be displayed as a
text listing, a simplified schematic, or a simpliflied chart showing the
relative orbital locations of each planet.  Graphics are colour on black
(with the option of printing colour on white to save ink/toner).

Each planet is further detailed with:

- - objects in sky (satellites, other worlds), with locations and apparent
sizes
- - period, rotation, orbital eccentricity, axial tilt, albedo
- - core type, density, mass, gravity, horizon, native life
- - atmospheric composition and pressure
- - temperature chart
- - world map
- - local population, cities, customs, attitudes
- - government description
- - legal profile
- - tech profile
- - gross world product, credit name/value, notable resources
- - atmospheric pressure and water pressure tables
- - passenger and freight rolls, unique cargo table (based on the system I
described in June)
- - satellite chart
- - animal encounter tables

I have some known bugs to track down, and some features to finish (such as
armd forces description) but I think some beta testing now would be really
useful.

My earlier Metator, now renamed Imperial Grand Survey, is almost finished as
well.  It was actually working before I tried to add all the above features,
so it\'s just a matter of removing the last few \'enhancements\' and getting it
to compile.

Yes, but what are the disadvantages? :)

\'Course, there\'s another option: eating at your station. :)

This is the same problem that folks had when using Books 4, 5, 6,
and 7 to generate characters (and also an indication of poor
editing and playtesting [*]).

There are two solutions: the rank descriptions _should_ have a
number in parentheses following the title.  This number is the
Traveller Rank equivalent (to be used for generating mustering-out
benefits).  This number is probably otherwise-unexplained in the
rules.

Failing that, use the following rule of thumb:

Rank	Traveller Rank
E1-E9	0
O1-O2	1
O3	2
O4	3
O5	4
O6-O7	5
O8-O10	6

This is valid for most services, with a few exceptions.  If the
service only goes to O7, then O7 is Rank 6 (not 5).  The original
books aren\'t consistent about handling this, so there will be
differences from the old method.


[*] All Traveller "Old Hands" (that is, folks who have been around
long enough to regularly use Books 4, 5, 6, and 7 to generate
characters) should know this one in their sleep (and therefore
probably missed in when checking over the rules).  On the other
hand, just handing the character generation system to either a
literal-minded playtester, or to someone who had never played
Traveller before with instructions to generate a few dozen
characters would have uncovered this one.

Oops.  For what it\'s worth, the character appears as an example in
my (early edition) of Book 1.  He\'s a merchant captain; I don\'t
know how IG made that particular mistake.

Read carefully, and remember that a term should be 4 years.

Probably another indication of sloppy editing.  *sigh*

thoughts on Traveller.  

1)  To reiterate, yup, there are errors galore.  Lots of typos (ie, "you 
can use your Compute skill to..." rather than "computeR skill," etc.).  
Problems with the mustering out rules.  Probably other stuff that I 
haven\'t found yet.  

2)  I talked to Matt Machtan about the errors in T4, and he said that 
part of the problem was that they had the book done the week it was 
supposed to go to the printer, then Marc Miller asked to see it 
(reasonable, since his name is on it[G]).  They showed it to him, and he 
told them to make some changes.  After making those changes, there really 
wasn\'t time to do a whole lot of double-checking.  This would be the 
source of errors like the mustering out system that makes no sense.
	I also asked Ken Whitman about the errors, and he added only that 
it did have a lot of errors, and that he (of course) wished that wasn\'t 
the case.  I asked whether there would be a 2nd Edition T4, and he said 
there would be, but not for 2 years or so.

3)  I played Starship Battles again today, and once again our team was 
beaten. :(  On the other hand, had we lasted \'till the end of the last 
turn, we would have won.  So, we came close... :)
	I spoke to a few of the participants afterword, and they all 
said, "If that was the simplified space combat, I\'d hate to see the 
original."  So, perhaps there may be a need for a RSSC system after all.  
Then again, Starship Battles /is/ in Alpha Testing, so perhaps the final 
product will be easier.
	The greatest difficulty of the game system is the number of 
factors in the computations necessary for attacks and sensor scans.  If 
you could get rid of that, the play would be fast and furious, which is 
what some (like me) enjoy most.  But getting rid of those things will 
also take away part of the flavor. 
	It\'d be quite a trick to simplify it more without ruining it.  As 
it stands, the only offensive weapons are lasers and missiles, while the 
only active defenses are (again) lasers and sandcasters.  No screens, 
etc.  Ships have armor, though, and structure points.  
	It\'s a good game, and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed playing 
it.  I look forward to the released version when it comes out next year.

Sure, you can do that...but the game doesn\'t have the parenthetical,

Yep, there will be differences.  But, the services do only go to O7 or 
O10, which makes it easy for those of us who have CT.  For new players, 
though, \'twill be a serius problem.

Yeah, he\'s the canonical example character.  And he is explicitly stated 
as being a Merchant throughout the example, but when they mention him 
receiving promotions, the ranks mentioned are not to be found on the 
Merchant "Table of Ranks," but on the Naval table.

Yup, terms are still four years no matter what the career.  But, on my 
first read-through they seemed to be saying "years" when they meant 
"terms," but I could be mis-reading it.  Here\'s an example:

"During each year of his service in a career, a character becomes 
eligible for one skill.  Upon receiving a commission, he becomes eligible 
for an additional skill.  Upon being promoted, the character also becomes 
eligible for an additional skill.  Thus, a character who joins the Navy, 
receives a commission, and then receives a promotion during the initial 
term of service becomes eligible for six skills (one for each of four 
years, one for commission, and one for promotion).  The same character, 
in the next term, is eligible for four skill [sic] (one for each year) if 
he does not receive another promotion."

All this discussion of years occurs even though the character generation 
system operates on a four-year (term) basis otherwise.  That is, each 
year is not resolved individually.  The term of four years is all 
resolved at one time, a la CT\'s basic character generation.  

Does it confuse me?  No.  But new players will probably be confused, and 
some will roll four times per term rather than once when it comes to 
promo, commission, injury, and continuance.  It seems to me they could 
have made it simpler by sticking to "term," as in: "You get four skills 
per term, plus one for receiving a commission and one for receiving a 
promotion."  

But, I\'m quibbling here.  It\'s not a serious error, like the mustering 
out one.

=================
Now that I\'ve said that, I want to mention that I\'ve done some thinking 
about the errors in the book, and I\'ve decided none of the ones I\'ve 
found so far bother me for myself.  That is, I only worry about them 
because I think they may decrease the chances of T4 becoming a smash hit.

But for myself, I\'ll throw my lot in with IG and FFE on T4, and I\'ll be 
using this system for the forseeable future.  Ignoring the errors, I can 
only quibble with some of the changes (the half dice, for instance) and I 
applaud others.  I have found nothing in T4 which makes me shudder. :)  
Take away the errors, and it is a solid system, and a worthy successor to 
the Traveller line.  It is what they promised:  A return to CT, with 
changes appropriate to the 20 year interval since it was introduced.

This basic book is just that: the basic book.  It is simplified and 
streamlined (ie, the return to CT) so that new players can more easily 
learn the system.  Marc Miller, in his seminar, discussed the trend in 
RPGs toward increasing complexity.  He mentioned that newbies faced with 
AD&D 2nd Edition are in for a long, difficult journey to understanding 
the game.  He doesn\'t want Traveller to be that way...at least, not in 
the basic book.  He /does/ want complexity and details in the add-on 
books, but those are optional accessories not necessary to playing the 
game.  TMLers will enjoy the Aliens book(s), the detailed combat, ship 
combat, ship design, world/system creation, and other books.  But the 
core system should be simple.  And it is.  I think IG and Marc have done 
the right thing for Traveller.  

I just wish it\'d been error-free.  Oh, well.

Until (unless?) we get official word from IG, I\'d suggest
presenting the table and rule I gave as the "fix" for the error,
though.  The differences are minor (and of the "Big Three" -
Mercenary, High Guard, and Scouts - the only one that differs from
the rule and table I gave is Mercenary).

> But, on my first read-through they seemed to be saying "years" when they
> meant "terms," but I could be mis-reading it.  Here\'s an example:
[example deleted to save bandwidth]

It sounds like a slightly strange hybrid of "basic" (Book 1) and
"advanced" (Book 4, 5, 6, and 7) character generation.  The rules
should play fine as written, although characters will accumulate a
_lot_ more total skill leves than they used to, even under the CT
"advanced" system.

With the T4 system, characters will recieve 4 (plus a fraction)
skills per term, on average.  Under the CT "advanced" system, it
seemed to average out to about 2 per term, and the "basic" system
generated 1 and a fraction per term.

I think it\'s only confusing because you\'re used to CT.

> Does it confuse me?  No.  But new players will probably be confused,

I don\'t think so ... but I agree that your alternate wording is
more clear.  This is another case where a few more weeks of
editing and testing would have helped.

That, and Traveller still reads like it was written by wargame
designers.  ;-)

I don\'t think any of these are _serious_, but it bugs me that most
of them are avoidable, and that some (like the whole mustering-out
thing) are just plain thoughless.  Then again, my own error in
QSDS is of the same variety.

> I just wish it\'d been error-free.  Oh, well.

That\'s a little much to ask for.  I\'d have settled for a book with
no serious errors (the mustering-out problem is what I\'d call
"serious"; I assume that, left to their own devices, people will
just apply their rank numbers as DMs, so that O10\'s get +10?).

Well... Uhmmm... no and yes.
   The volume displacement of a small stateroom includes the individuals
share of the mess hall, sanitation plumbing, computer terminal /
communication or entertainment console, air vents and air fans, clothing and
personal items storage, and elbow room to play \'traveller\' while off-duty.
(life support is covered under it\'s own vol. requirements, so need not be
mentioned.)   All 28 cubic meters are not at the stateroom, but parcelled
out all over the living area of the ship, dispite how we draw our deck plans.

   A low berth is not just the two and a half meter long coffin with a
retractable hood, on a half meter tall bench.    It includes that wall full
of medical moniting equipment, several two meter tall large bottles of
various fluids and stuff to pump the victim full of, and pumps to do the
pumping, dedicated simplified computer to run it, and small emergency
back-up power supply.   In short a mini life support system.   Clearly this
will not fit under the bed in even the large stateroom.

   Of course there is no reason that the two systems cannot be designed to
intermingle.   The total volume displacement will be less than stateroom
plus low berth (28 + 14) due to more efficient usage of the \'wasted\' spaces,
( the space under the bed, the underfloor and overhead ceiling areas, that
lowest sock drawer that \'nobody\' ever uses, )

   I would suggest 1/2 the volume of a low berth added to the stateroom, and
double or triple the cost of the low berth added to the stateroom. (very
exspensive this custom installation).   Limit of one low berth added per
stateroom.   Stateroom cannot be entered while in emergency low berth mode
(cryogenic gases fill the room).    To restore the stateroom to normal use
requires flushing the rooms normal life support system with one week worth
of supplies (Cr2000).   Low berth supply usage is the normal Cr100 per use.

   DM\'s remember to check for what that room full of cryogenic gases do to
any personal gear left in the room.   For that matter, what anything left in
the room does to the cryogenic gases.  (Honest, Captian, I had no idea those
dirty socks would turn super acidic and eat thru the ship\'s hull !)

   In my game, to get \'AAA\' insurance rating, (required for high passenger
service in Imperial space), there must be room in the low berths for all the
crew and passengers, plus a conversion kit to make a emergency \'Bussard
hydrogen Ram\'/Ion drive engine out of whatever is left of the engeneering
section and the dismantaled jump grid.   This allows surviviors to make a
STL transit in event of a mis-jump.  Non of my player designed ship\'s bother
with this stuff dispite the safety advantages.   (Humm... maybe if I drop
the cost of a Mid passage ticket to Cr5000...)

I have spewed long enough....  and it is passed my bedtime....
I am off to go conserve some gravity....

	The 4-man low berth is an emergency low berth which, at least in 
CT, gave one a negative mod on the survival role.  This seems to have 
been omitted in TNE, but without it, as you point out, there is little 
reason not to use emergency berths for everything.  The one man low 
berth, at 14m^3 is the regular low berth.  As you correctly point out, it 
is far too big to be a bed.  That is because it is not just a bed, it 
includes access passageway and all the machinery that freezes people and 
keeps them alive in that peculiar state.

>Waste disposal and such is covered under life support so I dont see that

>people feel that its a problem.

	The machinery that processes the waste is covered under life 
support but the actual _restroom_ is not.  The real problem is that the 
so-called extra space in a stateroom includes facilities so that when 
someone is off duty they have room to do more than just lie down in the 
bunk they share with four other people.

	It is true that there are no hard and fast rules for how to 
allocate space for common areas.  For the sake of realism it makes sense 
that some such spaces exist and their volume has to come from someplace.  
The assumption that seems common to the old hands on the TML is that it 
is best to take this space from quarters.  After all, this makes more 
sense than taking it from the jump drive, right?  This means that the 
bunk itself is not 1 ton.  As you pointed out, this makes for a very 
large bed.  Instead, as I noted earlier, it includes that bunks share of 
passageway, head, personal storage, rec room, etc.  Check out the 
Traveller page at the missouri site.  I believe there are some deckplans 
there and you can see how other people have worked it out.

	First of all, the bunks do not take up all 28m^3, the machinery 
etc, takes up quite a bit.  Secondly, more people can fit into an 
emergency low berth because they are _frozen_.  They are not getting up 
to use the loo, they are not eating meals, they are not using rec 
facilities, they do not need to stretch their legs -- they are just 
_lying there_.

>Im sure that the crew on a sub sleeps more than 4 men per 28m^3.

	That may be true, but Traveller ships are based more on surface 
ships than on subs.  There are discussions on the beta list of including 
rules for more sub-like accomodations in future rules expansions, but 
until then we either have to use official rules as they stand, or our own 
variants.

	Why would you not have this common area in the first place?  
Roughly 10m^3 of common areas for each small stateroom seems not an 
unreasonable number.  Remember, the whole 28m^3 is not all inside the 
stateroom, that is just the amount allocated for the stateroom and 
everything that goes with it.

>Im hoping that this explains my theory a little more clearly than I did
>last night.

	<Sarcasm On> Have you thought of sleeping someone in the 
autodoc?  How about across the back seat of the air raft? <Sarcasm Off>
	Seriously, I get to feeling cooped up in my place in a lot less 
time than a week in jump space, and its plenty bigger than half a small 
stateroom.  Reducing that down to four people in 28m^3 sounds like it 
might work for a very specialized design with a special crew, but as SOP, 
it sounds like a prescription for claustrophobia and social conflict.

Happy Travelling,

  Bringing it back to Traveller - presumably we\'re in a similar position
to anyone not on the "Main World" - we can communicate without the
week-long intersystem lag, but actual physical transportation is a right
royal pain. :)

  So if you think waiting for the new version of Traveller is bad *now*,
just imagine having to have it shipped to, say, Mars (assuming we go
play with the microbes... :).

  Now, are organisms such as microbes able to set up forms of
government? Like, say, I don\'t know, feudal technocracies...

Thanks for responding.

I don\'t understand how you could get enough data for the Traveller charts by 
just using one word.  That\'s very interesting.  If I understand the 
Traveller tables correctly, you need to know which sounds and combinations 
are used as units (phonemes), the frequency of each phoneme by position in 
the syllable, the ratio of the occurance of syllable types, and any 
phonotactic exceptions like "CV cannot occur at the end of a word" or 
whatever.  This is the info I see reflected in the standard Traveller 
charts.  Are we talking about the same thing?

>>Another option is to write (or obtain) a program that creates a 
probability matrix for the next letter (including a space as a letter) based 
on the preceeding 2-5 letters.  In English, if you do this with a 
five-letter pattern you can tel the difference between fake Shakespear and 
fake Dickens.

Very interesting; where do I get that kind of program?  That type of program 
needs no data except single words?

I\'d love to have (Win95) programs to do these things (pretty please MIME), 
but I\'m especially interested in where the actual inspiration for the 
Traveller word generation chart came from (a book reference).  I\'ve 
researched this in (small) university libraries, and found data for letter 
or phoneme frequencies in English, but never according to the CV, CVC, VC, V 
pattern (to include different data for initial, mid, and final position in 
the syllable), and minus the ratio info.  It would take a lot of guesswork 
to make a Traveller-type chart from what I found.  The necessary data isn\'t 
there.  I\'m assuming that the person (Mr. Harshman?) who invented the chart 
for Traveller had a real-world source to base his first charts on.  He wrote 
the article as if he did (I got that impression at least).

>From Joe Walsh:

>>I spoke to a few of the participants afterword, and they all said, "If

easier.
	
I tried playing Battle Rider (which is simpler to play than Brilliant Lances 
I think) and my players (who are not wargamers) got annoyed with the 
super-detailed slow pace (same thing - repetitive sensor tasks and so on) 
and gave up.  My humble suggestion is to keep all the magnificent details 
but for a computer-based version of the starship combat simulation game (a 
Striker version would be great too!!).  I\'d love to see that!  It would be 
great for PBEM too!  Please, IG, please!!!

I\'m going to mark up my softcover T4 with the corrections.  I\'ll add the

adjust the other errors which I will go into below.

That\'s an apt summary, but you get even more skills than that!  I 
neglected to mention the skills your character gets before entering any 
service or college, which amount to a maximum of 7 and a minimum of 4 
(depending on the tech level of the home planet).  Also, at age 18 but 
before entering any service, you can attend one or more of EIGHT 
colleges!  Not all are available to an age 18 character, though (ie, you 
can\'t go from high school to Graduate College, nor can you immediately 
enroll in Commando School, Flight School, or Medical School).  

These changes (the initials skills and the collection of pre-service 
schools) are excellent, IMO, by the way.

Hmmm.  I think they\'ll just apply the rank numbers as the number of 
additional rolls on the mustering out tables.  It says that if you are 
rank 1-2, you get one roll, 3-4, two rolls, and 5-6, three rolls.  Some 
may add +1 for each rank beyond 6, but I think others may extrapolate 7-8 
to be four rolls and 9-10 to be five rolls.  No big deal in the long run, 
but wrong nevertheless.

Here\'s another serious error I found.  In the Skills chapter, it talks 
about Level-0 skill usage.  Only certain skills can be used at Level-0 
(ie, an unskilled person can\'t disarm a nuclear warhead, but an unskilled 
person could attempt to ride a horse).  The "certain skills" are supposed 
to be designated by italics in the skills listing and in the skill 
descriptions.  In fact, NO skills are in italics in the table nor the 
descriptions.  So there is no way to know for sure which skills are 
eligible for Level-0 usage.

A non-serious error I found is that in the character generation tables, 
skill clusters are listed in bold only in the colleges, not in the 
services.  That is, when generating your character in the colleges, if 
you roll a skill of "Bureaucracy," you know immediately that you have to 
look up the Bureaucracy skill cluster and pick one of the sub-skills.  In 
the services, you could roll "Bureaucracy," and since it isn\'t in bold 
you may simply write that down as your skill.

Obviously, when you go to use that skill, you\'ll look it up and find that 
you have to select a sub-skill.  Plus, eventually people will know which 
are skills, cascades, and clusters.  So, as I said, it\'s not a serious 
error, but it could goof people up for a while.

One change that I don\'t like:  The ships look different now.  A Mercenary 
Cruiser looks reminiscent of the CT/MT/TNE Merc Cruiser, but it isn\'t the 
same.  The Scout looks totally different.  The Pinnace looks quite 
different as well.
I\'ll miss the continuity and feel of the old ships.  They said 
"Traveller" to me.  But, eventually I\'ll get used to it, I guess.  It\'s 
no big deal, but for those of us who are long-time Traveller fans, it\'ll 
probably be bothersome for a while.  It\'ll take me a while to see the new 
ships in my mind during an adventure.  I\'m so used to the old mental 
picture of those ships...

Well, since you\'ve learned proper respect, I\'ll bequeath you with my 
wisdom [G]:

It is CT, updated based on 20 years of role-playing experience.  That is, 
it is exactly what they said it would be.

Take the Traveller Book, add a section on tasks, change the rolls to X- 
instead of X+, add a few new character types (Entertainer, Agent, etc.), 
make it four skills per term instead of one, graft on the QSDS ship 
system, and consolidate/update the skills list and you\'ll have a good 
approximation of T4.  You can even keep the Exit Visa adventure in there, 
as T4 includes that as well as a totally new adventure, "Rubicon Cross."

Some sections of T4 are word-for-word from The Traveller Book.  Others 
are modified to some degree. Still others are completely new (though 
these are few and far between).

T4, if it wasn\'t for the errors, would be the CT/MT enthisiast\'s perfect 
system.  TNE afficianados, I think, may have to think first before buying 
T4.  It has the TNE starships (sorta...we\'re all familiar with the 
changes in that system by now), but other than that it is totally CT and 
T4 (ie, new stuff).  

I\'m tentatively predicting that the lists will split to become TML 
(CT/MT/T4) and XBoat (TNE).  While there will undoubtedly be CT/MT 
purists who will not buy T4, the systems are close enough that we should 
be able to get along, share characters, adventures, equipment, etc.  All 
we\'ll share with TNE is the ship design system.  Of course, the X- 
rolling system is totaly new, so that will have to be changed regardless 
of the other system under discussion (CT/MT/TNE) when it comes to coming 
up with task-roll-related rules and such that we might wish to share.

I do encourage everyone to at least read some sections of T4 in the store 
before making a decision.  Other than the errors, it is a system worthy 
of play.  It will come down to individual tastes.

The point I was attempting to make, maybe it\'s later on, is that 
obviously multiple lowberths are capable of sharing machinery, granted if 
the machines malfunction during operation two people die not 1 but that\'s 
a pretty minor risk if you\'re stranded in deepspace.

In essence is this not what the quarters on all starships, except perhaps 
those owned by the UFP are for?  Look at the quarters on a Carrier, 
Missle Escort etc.  There\'s not enough room to play cards in there, this 
is why I was budgeting common space, space that could be a weight room, a 
 theatre, etc.  A multipurpose room for entertaining the men.

This is personal opinion of course but subs are a far better model for 
starships than surface ships are, when you get tired of someone on a 
surface ship you simply walk out that door and on to the deck and you 
don\'t have to look at them again for a few hours.  On a sub when you\'re 
sick of your roomie\'s face you\'ve got to deal with it, there\'s no where 
to go.  Everything in a sub has to be contained within a pressurized 
hull for maintenance purposes, on a surface ship you just keep bolting 
things onto the upper surface as technology advances.

To give people leg room, a place to sit down play cards and not interfere 
with their roomie who may be sleeping at the time.

Lets see we\'ve all slept in a hospital bed at one time and I know I\'ve 
slept in the front and back seats of a car on more than one occasion, 
it\'s not comfortable but you can do it.  Wouldn\'t want to do it for a 
week.

Actually I don\'t recall suggesting 4 people per 28m^3 I suggested 2 
people per 28m^3 and only on exploration or military ships, I wouldn\'t 
want to pay money to sleep in a closet.  How do you think they feel on 
the Space Shuttle, Mir Space Station or on the old Apollo missions?  An 
Apollo mission was what rougly a week out and a week back with three men 
cramed into something the size of a 68 VW bus, with no beds, private 
toilets or space for themselves.

There\'s no need for that, Stu.  The Combat section in T4 specifically 
deals with rocks, and you\'re in no danger.  Here\'s what it says:

"The topic of raged attacks covers everything from thrown rocks to 
artillery fire." . . . "Daggers, blades, bayonets, pole weapons, and even 
rocks can be thrown at a target at up to Short range." 

So, no more dropping rocks from space!  They\'ll only fall a few meters, 
then "softly and silently vanish away." :)

Ooop.  This is GROUND combat.  I\'ll have to look up rocks under Space 
combat. :)  Maybe that Anti-Relativistic-Rock suit isn\'t a bad idea. :)

it covers just about everything you\'d want it to (in a basic book), from 
hand-to-hand to artillery, tanks, robots, and other forms of ground combat.
It is possible to cover all of this (in a basic way) in 8 short pages 
because of the robust task system.  I\'m impressed.

Quick Summary:

You can still tell Traveller has its roots in wargaming.  :)  The 
original rules shine through in this section, and their flavor is 
retained.  However, the consolidating effects of having a task system has 
vastly simplified the combat rules over what appeared in CT.  Once you 
memorize the task system, combat will go very quickly.


Errors:

The only error I found in the section is in the section discussing 
explosives.  They don\'t mention whether a grenade is thrown at a target 
HEX or a target INDIVIDUAL.  Since the system uses range bands, I guess I 
can see why they didn\'t mention it.  But, it\'ll be hard for inexperienced 
players to resolve hand grenade attacks.  They can figure damage, but not 
to-hit.  Most will probably be able to puzzle it out though.


Cool Stuff:

1)  Multiple actions:  A character can now make a number of actions each 
round up to his or her related characteristic score, but at a penalty.  A 
person with Strength 8 can make 8 Brawling attacks per round, for 
instance, but each attack will have relatively little chance of 
succeeding (unless the character is very highly skilled).  

2)  Called Shots:  You can do a called shot for increased damage (two 
kinds), decrease damage (two kinds), or to disarm.

3)  "Holding" your actions is covered well.

4)  Special rules.:  In addition to the Tactics Pool and Endurance rules 
that are familiar to most of us, there are also Strength and Dexterity 
Pools.  Strength pools allow one to increase the damage done by 
non-ranged attacks.  Dexterity pools allow one to avoid being hit by 
non-ranged attacks (no dodging bullets, darn it![G]).

5)  Initiative:  Initiative is done more logically (I got a taste of this 
in the Starship Battles game, and it works well) now.  The side that 
wins the initiative moves LAST but attacks FIRST.  That way, they can 
react to the other side\'s movement, then fire attack before the other 
side does.  This is more playable than realistic, but from experience, I 
know it does work well.

This would be my thinking on it also.  I would agree that going to
University gets you some bonuses to your education but it would also
give specific skills.  A mixture of +1 Edu and skills would be a good
thing.

After I\'ve seen the rules (whenever they finally make it to Europe) I
might post some more firm ideas for a rework of this, but for the time
being -

Instead of just getting +4 Edu (+1 additional for an honour) the player
should roll 1d6 on a table to determine what they get (so for completing
a four year degree they get four rolls, degree with honours gets them
five rolls).

1	+2 EDU
2	+1 EDU
3	+1 EDU
4	+1 EDU
5	1 relevant skill
6	1 relevant skill
7	1 relevant skill
8	2 relevant skill
9+	nothing

+1 DM for every academic qualification the character already has.

This would mean for the previously cited example of a character that
completed Grad School (is this an Americanism?) twice with honours and a
four year degree with honours would get 11 rolls on the table, with
differing modifiers, instead of a straight +11 EDU.

For the first trip through grad school three rolls with no DM.  (Say +2
EDU and 1 skill).
Second time through grad school, three rolls with +1 DM. (Say +2 EDU and
1 skill again).
Four year degree, five rolls with a +2 DM. (Say +2 EDU and 3 skills)

Total effect of academic qualifications on this character +6 EDU and 5
skills.
The two extremes for this character would be +14 EDU & 0 skills / +0 EDU
& 16 skills.  These are unlikely to happen but maybe I should lose the
two +2 entries.

Relevant skills would need to be adjudicated by the referee in
co-operation with the player.  For example the referee could ask the
player what sort of course they wish to enlist in and then agree to six
skills that would comprise this course.  These six skills would then
comprise a look up table to roll on when a skill pick comes up.

Also I would advocate increased difficulties to enlist in courses for
which the character had no relevant qualifications.

Which version of the book did you read? The original, or the revised
edition that came out a few years back? The "revisions consisted of
removing a bunch of ham-handed editing by the original publisher, and
restoring a few cuts. I personally like the "revised" version better.
The feel is a bit different (*better*) without the stupid changes, and
the added scenes are most definitely *exactly* what you\'d expect to
happen give such a situation (the major one invovling what they use as
entertainment in the "occupied" areas.)

>>Were any other Heinlien novels made into movies?  Maybe we can get
>>Hollywood to take on "Stranger in a Strange Land"!  I\'d really grok that!

Stranger in a Strange Land has been "optioned" almost continously ever
since it came out. So far nobody has been stupid enough to try carrying
thru after the studio execs screw it up, or else they haven\'t had the
cash to be able to do it right *in spite of* the studio execs.

> I\'d *love* to see Double Star made into a movie!

It would require some rather extensive changes though. No way you could
keep the Martians, and making it involve interstellar travel throws in
some problems that while not obvious, would make for large plot holes.

So we\'d have to "lose" the aliens, unless a director has the guts to do
it *with* the Martians, as a sort of "alternate history" (which might
go over well, but just *try* selling it to the studios)

Between things like "Dark Skies", and the improvements in computer
animation (pioneered on TV by Babylon 5) I expect that it won\'t be
*that* long before it\'s possible for a *small* company to start
producing decent SF movies from the "classics".

what you do when you have plenty of spare time on your hands...

Anyway, One theme I explored was differentiating between students in 
the Sciences and students in the Liberal Arts.  Having observed 
modern day grad-student life, I ruled that Liberal Arts students 
tended to get more bonuses to edu and fewer specific skills, while 
students of the Sciences got more specific skills and fewer edu 
bonuses.  

This reflects the overall impression that I got that Liberal Arts 
students tended to be encouraged to explore and broaden knowledge on 
as wide a variety of subjects as possible, even when focusing quite 
specifically on a dissertation topic.  Those in the Sciences 
generally seemed to only get more specific with their studies as they 
progressed, getting less "worldly".  

It should be obvious at this point that I view edu as an 
all-encompassing rating of awareness, mostly having to do with 
general knowledge of the world around the character.  

After breaking up with my girlfriend in California, moving to 
England, and deciding that I might as well just wait for T4 to come 
out, I\'ve recently dug all my work on the education systems out.  
I\'ll update the actual numbers after I get the books.

Frankly, the task mechanic in TNE is superior to MT,IMO (can\'t say about T4
until I have it in my hands).  I\'ve never been mistaken for a TNE fanatic,
but I always thought it\'s task system was
outstanding.  Every roll was against a single 1d20 and the task levels
could be pre-generated, ie.

                                  x4    x2    x1     /2    /4
Skill       Level+Attrib=Asset | Easy  Avg   Diff  Frmdbl Imps

Astrogation   2      7     9   |  36    18     9     4      2
 
I made up character sheets like this with a place for each task difficulty
level already layed out.  When a character was created we filled in each
row.  From then on it was just a matter of:  a. calling out the difficulty,
b. rolling a 1d20, and c. comparing the result against the proper row and
column of character sheet.

I think that is a bit overstated.  Personally I am sticking with the
TNE rules, I have every other set of Traveller rules, and so far I like
TNE best. I really like detailed rule sets.  I liked the 4th edition of
Champions alot more than the 3rd, because there were so many more
options. Its the same way with Traveller. I\'m not slamming T4, heck I
haven\'t even seen it, my copy is still in the mail :(, I am just
reacting to reports on the net.  MM said they will release more
compicated versions of combat and character generation later on, maybe
I\'ll switch later on, but for now I\'ll use TNE.  
	This doesn\'t mean I won\'t read the TML, or talk to you guys,
most of the stuff I write up is on background anyway.  I wouldn\'t think
of it as a split among Traveller fans, more just as way to allow 
people to select the rule set that fits them best.  Vanya will use
modified MT, you\'ll use T4, and I\'ll use TNE, but we will all still be
playing Traveller, and we can still argue about dropping rocks on
Feudal Technocrats.

How is this superior to the MT task system?  All I have to do in MT is
keep
track of my skill level, and add it to 2d6.

Here, we can agree on task system quality. :)  MT\'s task system was too 
complex.  When I read TNE, I liked the task system...except for the D20.  
Just a personal choice, I know.  There isn\'t a logical reason for not 
liking dice other than six siders.  :)

Yeah, I guess I was jumping the gun in proclaiming what I did.  Lord 
knows I\'ll never, ever, ever get rid of my CT stuff.  Heck, I\'m still in 
the market for a few more CT items! :)  

Like you, I enjoy complexity.  But there are differences in our views of 
it.  I like the CT style of complexity:  complexity with choice.  On a 
system-by-system basis, you can choose to use the simple one or the 
complex one (and, in many cases, there are other gradations).  Sometimes 
I roll up basic CT characters for NPC\'s, other times I use the advanced 
character generation systems.  I do the same thing with other systems, 
using what I feel is appropriate at the time.  

Another difference between our views is that I am willing to go with T4 
as-is for a few months, until they come out with the more complex stuff 
so I once again have a choice.  I guess it is partly a leap of faith, and 
partly a willingness to give up the choice (for a time) in favor of jumping 
right into T4.

Well said.  I certainly won\'t be bashing people for making a different 
choice than I do.  But since the first time after T4\'s release that 
someone said they prefer an older set of rules, I\'ve been dreading 
another split among the fans.  

Hopefully, T4 won\'t do the same thing to the fans that TNE did.  In other 
words, I hope all the fans can take the same attitude you do.

Ut oh.  Here come the Task System Wars. :)  Uh..how about a compromise?

	I have written some simple awk scripts for calulation weapons,
	and for lasers and mesons they give quite the right values, but
	for particle accellerators I think I have the wrong formular
	for calulating the effective range. An other minor discrepance
	is the calculated diameter of a meson gun. If somebody with
	more knowledge of imperial design want to debug it, he is
	invited to do so.

X	FF&S - Weapon design scripts		(c) GPL kraehe@bakunin.north.de
X	----
X
X	This is the first alpha version of my weapon design scripts, based
X	on formulars from FF&S (c) GDW. I used GNU-AWK as an implementation
X	language because its highly portable an free available for several
X	platforms.
X
X	Usage :
X
X	calculate standart turret laser :
X
X		TL 12, 120 Mj, 18dm radius, 4 clicks beam pointer
X
X	echo 12 120 18 4 | laser.gawk
X
X	calculate particle accelerator :
X
X		TL 12, 1000 Mj, 144m length, 10 click beam pointer, 18dm radius
X
X	echo 12 1000 144 10 18 | particle.gawk
X
X		TL 12, 400 Mj, 30m length, 4 click beam pointer,
X		maximum radius
X
X	echo 12 400 30 4 | particle.gawk
X
X	calculate meson gun :
X
X		TL 12, 1000 Mj, 144m length, 5 click beam pointer
X
X	echo 12 1000 144 5 | meson.gawk
X
X	Limitations & Bugs :
X
X	- The techlevel must be between 10 and 15.
X
X	- The calculated values are slighliy different to brillian lances
X	  for lasers and meson guns. This is documented in a FF&S erata.
X
X	- Effective range for particle accelerators is very different to
X	  brilliant lances, this is perhaps a bug in FF&S or in my scripts.
X	  (But I rethought my script more than once ;-)
X
X	- Only space combat damage is calculated and lasers are always
X	  tuneable.

Well, schooling does yield skills and EDU under T4.  One skill per year 
(plus possible bonus skills, as with careers), and one point of EDU per 
year.  This is true of all eight forms of schooling, by the way.  

I dug out my old EDU to Schooling Equivalent chart, and I never 
envisioned a 1:1 ratio for schooling years to EDU.  It just doesn\'t work 
out.  15 possible points, and many more than 15 possible years spent in 
schooling.

Here\'s the chart I came up with, lo these many years ago:

EDU   Highest Grade Completed    
 1    No Formal Schooling
 2    2nd Grade 
 3    4th Grade
 4    6th Grade
 5    8th Grade
 6    10th Grade
 7    High School Diploma/Equivalent
 8    1 Year of College
 9    AA/AS
 A    BA/BS
 B    MA/MS
 C    Ph.D. 
 D    Ph.D. & BA/BS 
 E    Ph.D. & MA/MS
 F    Ph.D. & Ph.D.

Obviously this table has its problems as well, and I\'d probably make it 
differently if I were to do it again today.  Nonetheless, it is useful 
for illustrating a different idea of what EDU signifies.  IG assumed each 
point of EDU represented one point of college/university education.  I 
preferred to think of 7 as being a high school diploma, and roughly each 
point thereafter as an additional degree.  Under my system, then, a 
character who completes the four-year College process would have an edu 
of A.  One who went on to the Graduate School table would, the first tim 
around move to EDU B, the second time C, and so on.

This, coupled with the one skill per year rule already in place, seems 
more realistic to me.  But, then, I see education as simply being a 
reflection of school years completed (as does IG), which doesn\'t work 
quite as well in terms of logic when used with EDU-based task rolls.

If it produces a better character sheet than the one in the back of T4,

Most likely it was the original. I still have it; it\'s an old Signet paperback. I
didn\'t know there was a newer, revised version. Was it revised by
Heinlein, or was it published posthumously?

Yeah, but you have to admit that the *idea* would make for a suspenseful

Tell you what, I\'m sure enjoying the reruns of "V" on the Sci-Fi channel!
Much better than "Independence Day," IMHO.

It looks almost exactly like the one in the back of the T4 book. What 
would people like to see in a T4 character sheet? I\'m open to any and all 
suggestions.

I also going to design a GM screen tonight since IG may not get to it for 
awhile.

first time through.  On going back over the Skills listing, the error I 
noted therein is actually far less serious than I had originally thought.

It is true (as I noted) that the promised italics used as an indication 
of skills that may be used at Level-0 are missing from the Skills List.  
However, in the actual Skill Descriptions, such skills /are/ noted.  The 
method is using the word "Default" after the skills, such as:

Acting (Performance Cluster, Default)    Int or Soc

I had mistaken the intended use of italics to be in the Skills 
Descriptions as well as in the Skills List.  This is not the case.  So, 
it /is/ possible to know which skills may be used at Level-0.  It is not 
as easy to discover as it would have been had italics been used, but this 
is certainly not a serious error.

My misunderstanding stems from the last paragraph on page 37, which states:

	"[level 0 skill use is] possible only with skills listed in 
	italics on the Skills List.  (The heading for each of those skills is 
	italicized in the individual skill descriptions as well.)"

But then in the Skills Description section, just prior to the beginning 
of the actual descriptions, it reads:

	"As in the Skills list, those skills that can be used at level 0 
	as a default are noted, as are cascade skills."

The use of the word "default" in that statement led me to re-evaluate 
what they meant by Default in the Skills Descriptions.  I had originally 
thought it meant that the skill was not a cascade skill.  In fact, there 
are many non-cascade skills listed without the word "Default" in their 
heading.  I conclude from this that "Default" must mean that the skill is 
usable at level 0.

This conclusion is borne out by the types of skills with the word 
"Default" in their heading and those that do not.  Acting, 
Administration, Athletics, and Blade Combat are "Default," while 
Artillery, Battle Dress, and Demolitions are not, for example.

I apologize most humbly to everyone for making this mistake.

As it stands, T4 now has only one known serious error: the problem with 
Mustering Out rolls.  All other errors are minor and unlikely to affect 
play (ie, typos, grammatical errors, missing bold face and italics, etc.).

Neat!  Thank you!

Personally, I\'d like to see the Mustering Out section axed (the info in 
there really belongs in the Equipment/Credits/Valuables section).  I was 
thinking of scrunching the Advanced Education section over so its right 
edge is at the same point as the righ edge of the 
Characteristics/Background section above it.  Move 
Equipment/Credits/Valuables to where Mustering Out was, then extend 
Skills & Knowledge down into the space previously occupied by 
Equipment/credits/valuables.  I don\'t think space for 17 skills is enough 
under this system.  25 (or as close as you can get it to that) is more 
like it.

(Though this does squeeze eqiuipment/credits/valuables into a small 
space, I admit.  But since weapons and armor are in their own box, that 
might prove sufficient.  If not, there\'s always the back of the sheet, 
which is where my group has always listed equipment anyway.)

Different strokes, I suppose. 

With MT you had to remember 3+, 7+, 11+, 15+ and what they went with.  You
had to add the, what was it 20% of the attribute to the skill to get your
number, but that could be pregenerated.  Then add that number to one of
those level numbers and compare to a 2d6. Easy for you! <g>

Harder for me. <shrug>

Truth to tell, T4\'s system would be OK with me if it wasn\'t for the darn .5
dice!  No matter what Joe says I *know* I\'m not going to like them. <g>

Eris

ps.

I wrote a Traveller-4 Die Roller this afternoon.  That\'s one reason I
wanted the know whated the details on the task levels, I knew I had this
afternoon off to work on the program. <g>

It works nicely, just hit the button for the task level and it generates a
number for you.  As long as the computer rolls the .5 dice for me, the
system is just fine.  <g>

I don\'t like using lots of different dice sizes either, but I don\'t take it
to extremes like you.  Using d6\'s, d10\'s and d20\'s would do it for me.  I\'d
personally *prefer* to do everything on d100, but there isn\'t a system like
that enough like Traveller to lure me away.  <g>

You know it\'s the distributions that are the problem, normal vs uniform.  A
single d6 has a very course uniform (flat) distribution, and you can\'t get
anything more fine unless you add more pips.  Add a second die and now your
distribution is normal (bell shaped). There are many kinds of things easier
to handle with uniform
distributions, but for that you need d10\'s, d20\'s, etc.  You just can\'t
substitute more d6\'s, uniform distributions don\'t look or act like normal
distributions.

The last couple of days I\'ve been thinking about the task system, the way
skills are figured in general.  Attributes *should* play a part in a
skill\'s asset, but not as big a part as they do in TNE and appear to do in
T4.  Take one skill, Astrogation for example:  your controlling attribute
is AGL 7, your skill level (that you spent 12 years developing) is 3, your
asset is 10..fully 70% coming from your attribute!   Your 12 years of
experience and work are only 30% of your ability to fly that ship?  You are
only 30% better after all this time than the first time you stepped onto a
Bridge?

Can\'t say I have a good answer.  I\'ve toyed with all kinds of ideas, but I
haven\'t come up with anything...yet.

I understand your reasoning, and in *general* I\'d agree with you.  I hate
to get into this too much without seeing T4, but here goes...

In the game I just don\'t think it would work out.  The way TNE and now (I
think) T4 uses EDU as a *major* portion of many, many skills makes the
attributes extremely important.  The act of getting a +1 in EDU is the same
as getting a +1 in every skill you have (or will ever have) that is based
on EDU.

Think about it!  "Hum, take a +1 in history or a +1 in EDU, and therefore
raise history and 6 more skills?  Which you should I take?"  <g> I can
really see people using strategies to maximize their Attributes, and then
adding a bunch of Skill 1\'s.  This would leverage their investment much
more than investing directly in skills.

I honestly think the use of attributes as big chunks of a skill asset is
wrong.  No, "wrong" isn\'t the right word..unrealistic, that\'s it!
Unrealistic.

Ok! Ok! <g>

Not the Task System Wars, the beginning of the New Improved Much Better
Task System.  Speaking for the list in general, there were some things
about MT\'s system we like, some things about TNE\'s system we like, and
(when we get our hands on it) there will be some things about T4\'s system
we like.  There are also things we *don\'t* like.  <g> 

Rather than bashing, let\'s discuss ways to make the systems we use better. 
I\'d like a way to adapt TNE\'s task system to work with T4. I\'d like to find
a way to modify, tweek, T4\'s system so that it doesn\'t use those .5 dice! 
<g> I\'d like to look at ways of reducing the influence of attributes to
more reasonable levels.

If there\'s a way to do it, we need to figure out a way to design those .5
dice right out.  How about some alternate Task System rules?  <g> Maybe we
could come up with a way to do it in 5 steps, 1d6 up to 5d6?  Or maybe a
way to move the TNE task system over to T4 can be worked out?

Uh, roughly 50%? <g>  (1-(1-.1)^7)

Now what is the chance of a 10%/day event happening *exactly* once during a
week?

Seriously, we need probability tables for 1.5d6, 2.5d6, and 3.5d6. I\'ve
done this sort of thing for 2, 3, and 4d6 using brute force, but *is* there
a way to figure probabilities for each number in some easier manner?

There is a simple solution to the .5d6: double the target number and multiply all d6\'s rolled by 2.  The .5d6 becomes a full d6 and everything is fine.  If you cannot hanlde multiplying by two, count all dice except the .5 twice when adding the total!

The alternative of doubling the number of d6\'s rolled and comparing to twice the target isn\'t as nice because of the nasty bell curve.

Well, I see EDU not as years of school, or even knowledge learned. I see it
as a basic *ability* to learn in a scholarly way.  Having high EDU should
mean it\'s easier for you to learn and improve certain kinds of skills, and
that you improve in those skills faster. 

The *right* way to do this would be to make the controlling
Attribute some kind of multiplier of the skill levels.  A
straightforward way to do it would be to multiply the Attribute by the
skill level to get the Skill Asset.  This way a PC with very low Attributes
wouldn\'t go up per skill level nearly as much as a PC with high Attributes.


As I see it..

INT is raw intelligence, creativity, learning by doing.

EDU is learning from books, in schools, the skill of *how* to study
effectively.

AGL is a sort of body-intelligence, balance, fine and gross
dexterity.

STR is power, lifting ability, how hard you hit.

CON is endurance, how much you can take.

Just *what* is T4\'s sixth Attribute?  <g> Social Standing or
Charisma?

Hows about 7 * (.1 * (1-.1)^6) = .37

I.e. The chance of it only happening on the first day is .1 * .9 * .9 * ...
and on the second .9 * .1 * .9 * .9 * ...  and so on.  These events have
no intersection so the probability of two occuring together is zero.
The old rule P(A or B) = P(a) + P(b) - P(A and B) gives the answer.

Brute force still works.

You could work things out a little more nicely:  1.5d6 is a d6 and a d3; each
combination of rolls has a 1/18 chance of occuring.  Now you\'ve only got
to work out which of the 8 legal values (2..9) each of the 18 rolls can
give.  Naturally it gets more involved for 2.5d6 and 3.5d6 but it is
still possible....

Finally, rather than buying a d3, try making them.  Get a block of wood
and some dowel in a contrasting colour.  Shape the block square and
rounds the edges a bit.  Drill holes for the pips and use the dowel to
make it look nice.  I\'ve d6\'s and d3\'s with 8.5cm 3.5 (inch) edges -- not
much use for gaming cause they dent the table, but great for throwing at
people.  A smaller version should do the trick nicely.

Yep, and I\'m not interested to going to 8 dice on a roll either. <g>

I\'m going to have to have my hands on T4 before I decide about the Task

Personally I just call out the skill to roll against, the players roll
and compare the result to their asset, and then tell me what
difficulty level they would have succeeded at.  This gives me the
ability to give out more information for better successes without
forcing the players to roll several times, or even to know when they
have all the information.  From the sounds of it this isn\'t possible
with the T4 task system.

Remember, under T4 the target number for level 0 skill use is 1/2 the 
relevant attribute, rounded up.  So, no, you are not only 30% better than 
you were when you first stepped on the bridge.

The problem you note does, however, come into effect when going from 
level 1 to level 2.  As you say, you may spend 4 years gaining that one 
skill level, yet it only leads to a relatively small increase in the 
probability you will succeed at a given task.  

Under this sort of system, it would be better to have many skills at 
level 1 than fewer skills at higher levels, I think.  Hmm.

I Just want to discuss one of the things that had been brought up 
during the "Gee, I hope T4 is/is not" discussions we had a few weeks 
ago, which I thought I should address now that T4 is out:

Many of us were hoping the setting would be separate from the rules.  
In my opinion, this is sufficiently the case to make me happy.  The idea 
of the official setting is visible throughout the book in that the 
underpinnings of that setting, such as jump drives and no other FTL 
communications, are there.  In a few locations the book discusses or 
alludes to the official setting.  

BUT, the book kept the "you can recreate any setting from any book or 
movie, or your from your own imagination with these rules" speech from 
the CT books.  And, the only specifics it gets into vis a vis the 
Imperium is the Core sector grid, the Core sector data, the Library data, 
and the two adventures.  

In other words, the book is neither more nor less setting independent 
than TTB.

Somewhere on the Net are the DGP sectors, which covered the 3rd 
Imperium for around 1116... Some of the sectors are incomplete 
and/or erroneous, but that\'s the nearest thing I know of to the 
complete list of UWP for charted space.  I don\'t know the URL; 
you might try the ftp.mpgn.com archives.  (I have them on a CD,  
but that\'s not on-line).  I have no idea about 1201, but there 
are some handy scripts for collapsing systems to post-1200 status 
that will let you do whole sectors in a hurry.

Sort of: get it published in something like "Traveller Chronicle" 
or "Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society"--or just write it up 
in detail for Jeff Zeitlin to add to his RICE paper collection. 
If people like it, they\'ll use it.  If they don\'t, they\'ll use 
their own versions of a system.  If Imperium Games writes a TNS 
item using special features of your system, or stages an adventure 
there, I guess that would be as "official" as it gets. 
 
(Rob Dean\'s shipbuilders "Steward Interstellar Enterprises" seem 
to have gotten semi-official status; everyone liked Rob\'s MT ship 
designs that he posted to the list, and some of them got published 
in Challenge articles with the SIE references intact, so that SIE 
seems to have become an established part of the Regency background...)

I don\'t know if that\'s been tackled in T4 yet, but quite a few 
of us fall back to the old "Trillion Credit Squadron" formulas 
for calculating annual Navy budget, given population and a government 
type.  Use starport & tech level mods to the value of a credit, and 
that almost covers trade.  Unfortunately, I don\'t have the necessary 
references to hand as I write this, so someone else will have to 
provide the formulas. 
 
The campaign rules for the original "Striker" also covered determining 
annual military budget.  It wouldn\'t be too hard to cobble together 
rules for what you want, based on those two sources.  Also, "Fifth 
Frontier War" had some rules, regurgitated in (IIRC) The Rebellion 
Sourcebook for determining how many System Defense Squadrons and 
Army units a world had, based on population and tech-level and a 
few other modifiers. 
 
Note that not all these formulas were consistant with each other.

No, it means the Laws of Traveller Physics CHANGED from CT/MT to TNE. 
Pick one or the other, or do what I did and come up with some 
explanation why the 3rd Imperium couldn\'t build jump-capable ships 
under 100T while post-collapse civilizations could... (In my case, 
I presumed that the Solomani jump theory, like the Vilani jump 
theory before it, and the Aslan jump technology based on it,  
had some minor flaw in it that kept them from figuring out how  
to scale down jump drives and make them work.  It must have been 
a subtle flaw, because Hiver, K\'Kree and Vargr jump theory are 
equally flawed.  The Droyne, OTOH, keep their jump theories to  
themselves, so who knows what they *really* know...)

The Empire can at any time require that any member world provide a certain
portion of its income and armed forces to help the greater good of the
Imperium. This shall not exceed 10% of the worlds assets or defense
force without consetual agreement by the member world in question.

Any world that acts in a manner to interfere with free trade will be
dealt with most stringently by the Imperium, up to and including
occupation  and dissolution of the government should sanctions not be

Loopholes: incompetent Emperors should be oustable under law, but this
should not be readily apparant.

Names: 	Articles of Imperialization?
	Imperial Charter?
	Proclaimation and Articles of the Imperialization of the Sylean
Federation?
	Declaration and Charter of the Third Imperium?


etc
