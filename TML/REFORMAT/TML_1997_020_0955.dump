As actives drop of at 1/(r^4) compared to passives 1/(r^2) there will be NO
long range active sensors in space. Also, the advantage to know the range
to target at each instance is not as important when weaponry generally move
at c or near c.

Shutting down is almost instantaneous - less than one (30 minute) space
combat turn. I suppose one could argue that the waste-heat radiators (which
is where all the IR signature comes from) take a minute or two to cool down,
but not much more. 

Restarting (according to the TNE/Brilliant Lances rules) takes a full turn
before you can use the power plant; you can make an engineering rule (should
be Formidable in T4 terms) to start it up faster.

I would have reservations about keeping a ship on station for any extended
period of time.  You not only have crew endurance to consider, but there
is incoming traffic propagating at and around that point (yes, it\'s a
very small possibility, but the chance of collision still does exist), but
having that J6 ship sitting out there, all by itself, would be an
incredible temptation to competitive corporations (not to mention the bold
corsair).

Of course, there is no reason that the ship has to be in the orbit of the
mainworld, any orbit (including solar) would be sufficient - provided that
the resources represented by the ship and support staff justify the cost
(ref. the rest of my original post).

Unfortunantly, no.  You could easily use the FFS1 rules with a little
conversion, but since you are so retentive about sticking exactly to the
rules as handed down from the mountain, I know *that\'ll* never happen  :)

TML= Traveller Mailing List.

Famile Spofulum.  

Hmm.. 

About a year ago we set up a semi-game arounf the Imperial Ship Builders
Association (ISBA) to test out the various ship building methods for T4.
This led to the THUDDD competitions, where we all try to design the best
ship for a given mission statemnt.

Famile Spofulum is Rod Elliot\'s company, known for their motto of "nothing
is to small to have spinal meson gun!"

My corp, Gridlore Technologies (Serving the Imperium for (checks calender)
about six weeks now) and FS are bitter rivals, and tend to slag each other
regularly.

The ISBA maintains a web site, and we have our own mailing list which is
about half role play and half gear headism.

Hope you survive the encounter then have a nice long talk with the company
rep.  Seriously, I imagine that you\'d keep several copies of the program in
storage to take over if the main program fails.  Probably the three ship;s

Depending on how smart the AI is.  Of course, the next time you are in a

about how it was violated. (There\'s another story for the real hi-tech
end.. your ship\'s computer sues you for violating its contract!)

They have a *really* good union.  Astrogators provide human oversight and
make sure that the computer has performed the task with maximum effciency.
Many smaller merchant ships don\'t use a dedicated Astrogator, having the
pilot double check the numbers while coasting towrds the 100-diameter limit.

Having played an assult lawyer in TNE (Eneri "Pudding" Stenbrau, Esq.), I
can only imagine that enforcing copyrights is one of the biggest challenges
for a 3I company.  Any interstellar firm will be keeping a sharp lokout for
violations.

When Palladium sued WOTC over The Primal order a few moons back, the case
moved very quickly.

Patents last for seven years IIRC, copyrights last as long as you defend them.

Serving on a interstellar scale.. there\'s a campaign for a small group!
For an Imperial violation like copyright violation (this would be a part of
Imperial Law IMHO, since rights protection is vital to trade) you\'d
probably get roving teams of lawyers on retainer to procescute several
outstanding cases.  When they catch up to a defendant, they simply file on
that Imperial world.

Most rights infringement cases are heard (in the US) by a judge in a
non-jury trial.

The radar wont penetrate the metallic hull (thats why the are so easy to
detect those metalhulls on radar). You will NOT damage anything with radar
at spacecombat wavelengths and you cannot focus them as they\'re bound by
the same quantum mechanical laws that forces visible light lasers to
handwave grav focussing in order to keep their beams together, radars on
microwaves have SO much larger wavelength/focussing spot.
Guys crawling around on your hull or nearby however are a different topic.
You could fry them easily with your radars.

 They\'d get leukemia at mild effect doses, at high doses they get blood
clotting from proteins in blood denaturizing etc, skinburns etc. Apparantly
some workers got slightly cooked while working at the focus on some NORAD
radars when some klutz accidentally turned one of them on. They got
leukemia in the long run but this I got from hearsay so it might be one of
those "rat in pizza" stories.

Mir Research
KOROLYOV, RUSSIA--U.S. and Russian scientists are increasingly
excited about the Mir space station project, which promises to reveal
more than has ever been known about the scientific relationship
between weightlessness and mortal terror.
 
"By stranding our scientists on a dilapidated space station with
faulty wiring, loose hardware, and malfunctioning air systems," NASA
head Daniel Goldin said, "we have created extremely favourable
conditions for learning about spaceborne panic."
 
The two Russians and one American on board the station are
reportedly terrified beyond lucidity.
 
Among the ground breaking experiments conducted on board Mir: a
June 25 collision with a cargo craft that depressurized the Spektr
module; last week\'s emergency power shortage, caused by a disconnected
cable; and the periodic release of "dry ice" steam that simulates a
shipboard fire. All have been deemed a huge success by agency heads.
 
"They are in a constant state of what aerospace scientists term
\'mind-shattering terror,\' frightened for their very lives," Russian
mission director Vladimir Solovyov said. "And we have not even used
the hull-mounted Alien puppet that taps on the window yet."
 
"We have also taken huge leaps in our understanding of the
patterns created when one wets his pants in the weightlessness of
space," Solovyov said. "The urine spreads out in an expanding sphere,
something we did not expect."
 
Taking a break from his busy schedule, astronaut Michael Foale
told ABC News reporters: "Where is Mommy?"
 
"Please tell me the access code to the Soyuz capsule," Russian
cosmonaut Aleksandr Lazutkin said. "I would like to return to the
chaotic government and widespread hunger of my homeland."
 
Scientists expect to gain even more useful data during an
experiment at 3 a.m. tomorrow. As the astronauts sleep, whirling red
siren lights will flood the cabin while an ear-splitting klaxon alarm
jolts them awake. Detailed scientific data will then be collected on 
such
variables as open weeping, defecation and hair loss.

Actually, you could argue that a communist state is the equivalent of a

paid to shareholders, and there you have it.  (Now, this is an analogy.  But

Remember that the government code is a description of the effect of the

theory, a representative democracy, but there are months when I feel that I
am living in an impersonal bureaucracy, if not an oligarchy.  (Anyone living
in Ontario will know what I mean.)  I have heard America described the same
way.  Britain is a constitutional monarchy (which doesn\'t appear on teh

I always wondered: How much will this be offset by the loss of the lift that

I liked it, but then I buy Weber books immediately.  I did find it less
interesting than Field of Dishonor, but others have disagreed with me.

It did give me a few nice touches to throw at the players when we do our
next Naval campaign.  I expect that will be in a few years, as we are in
the middle of a multi-group episodic campaign set between Y0 and Y40.  We
have about a year left in this one, followed by a fantasy game for a year,
and then back to SF.

In general, in my Traveller universe, you do not.  The core operating
features of all programs by TL 12 are set in stone.  What you can do is try
to talk the computer into executing the programs in a more efficient way,
or using a different scheduler, and so on.  The role of a high computer
skill by TL15 is more like a robo psychologist than a present day programmer.

In other words - you never ask the machine to do something new, but if you
know what question to ask in what order, you can get optimal cache filling,
and so on, which can make the things the machine is doing take far, far
less time.

My assumption is that Traveller is using Golden Age Technology (tm), in
which it takes hundreds of years to make a substantial change in any given
area.  As a result, they have more time to figure out the ramifications of
the tech they use.  It is very likely that most Traveller software has been
verified to be bug free statistically, if not mathematically.

In point of fact, this is an old Vilani rule (my canon) - software was
treated for them like drugs are for us.  If your software crashed, you were
legally responsible for all damage, even if you sold it in good faith.

I rule that it is very, very hard to make a Traveller computer go outside
the specifications.  Someone had to design in whatever you want it to do.
Now, they may not have thought of applying the fire control algorithms to
doing a news search, but the capabilities for both are mature, and are both
in the system.  Unless someone has specifically marked them out for this
task, you can apply them.

You are using a present day model.  Think in terms of a people who take
centuries to advance in tech level.

"I am going to be out of contact for two months, starting 001-0020.  When
was your last update to "AutoGunnerZap-1?"

"Hmmm.  You might have a problem, sir.  Our last update was on 001-(0027),
when we added support for the official TL12 light laser array.   Since it
has only been 47 years since our last update, there is a reasonable chance
of a bug occurring in the laser software."

For this to work, there must be standardization up the wazoo.  This, to me,
is why the office of calender compliance has such power in M0 - they are
the standardizing body, and make sure that any laser array you purchase
complies with the pages and pages of specifications on what the laser array
will do when the software issues one of its documented 5000 possible commands.

>I\'ve been thinking about jumping to the implications of s/w in Traveller:
>

If it GPFs, you aim the working laser arrays at their building.  They would
probably find that a kindness over facing the Imperial courts.

The consequences of failure are so high, and the number of sources so high,
that I cannot see them allowing the sale of a gunnery program that does not
meet some very stringent standards.  (I just interviewed with a medical
software company, and the hoops they jump through are impressive.)

You cannot, which is why I figure the jump software has been proven correct
mathematically.  Once they get into that mind set, I hope the rest of the
software industry follows.

I expect that they have made the protection so secure that it is not
economically worth it in most cases.  This, I think will remain true -
copying software requires lots of work in the 3I, and so it is just not
worth paying your top flight computer guy to spend his time doing that.

>* What do astrogators really do with all of their spare time?  Or on the

I rule that in jump and in normal space, minute variations of space
curvature caused by dust in normal space, and something unknown in jump
space cause fluctuations in the drive.  The astrogator, pilot, and engineer
are constantly working to keep the vessel from misjumping, or becoming
becalmed.

...

>* How long does it take for a trade secrets or patent violation case to

I rule that the 3I has fast courts and generous patents, as long as the
product is available to meet demand.  I also rule that they look very
negatively on keeping the supply low.  Zhunastu excepted...

Imperial justice covers so few areas, and they are so important to the
Imperium, that they need fast resolution.  This is important in the early
days, when people were out of contact with the One True Power, Sylea, and
stayed true as tradition.  This is why they had those local Nobles.

>* Does a ship\'s computer have any games other than Solitaire and

Gazillions of them.  A primary job of the Scout service is to interface
their computers with the worlds they contact.  Those high caliber people
are not needed until they hit a new world, and the free time they have goes
into game programming and heavy consumption of Scout Brew.

>** What are the Imperial subpeona laws like?  Do you still get the

I rule that they do not have a lot of power to compel in the general case,
but that when they need to use it for an Imperial crime, that they can do
almost anything.  Remember that the people sitting on the bench are almost
certainly Nobles, which I have rules as being the 3I equivalent of the
Forbes 500 list.  There are roughly 3000 ranked nobles above baronet in Y0,
and they all have world wrecking power.  As the Imperium ages, they sparse
out a bit, so that there are roughly 3000 per subsector, and it is rare for
anyone to be concerned with an area larger than that.

I agree with your point. IG need a writer\'s guide. Even just the GDW stuff

Except that, with the information lags, I don\'t see a centralized stock
market.  Oh, there will be some specialized markets, but I see the bulk of
security trading at the subsector, possibly the sector level.

And, as I said in my post, I do see the nobility (admittedly, I originally
was thinking at the domain level) keeping couriers, this is their arena.
But keep in mind, the government we are talking about is a mature one.
Important decisions are not made impulsively, or with short notice.  There
is extensive lobbying, and processes that ensure that all parties (at
least the important ones) are given the opportunity to address the issue.

And with the relative independance of the various domains (again, the time
lag in communications - the 5th FW was started, fought, and resolved
before word reached the Capital and came back) - Domain level politics
will be more of a concern to the involved parties than Imperial level
politics.

I agree.  Which is why I think the first few links of the X-Boat network
(as it enters, or perhaps just outside the borders of the various MC
territories) are subject to intense scrutiny, but establishing links all
the way to Capital...

We are talking about the imperial government, not the House of Lords.  Not
every minor beaurocrat is going to have the resources to afford a yacht.
(tho\' after a few years in a position of power and influence...)  Just as
PCs find themselves dealing with clerks who hold power over their 
fortunes, there will be minor beaurocrats, who by dint of their 
departments regulatory powers, may briefly be in a position where they
attract a fair amount of attention from the \'powers that be\'.

Yachts are, I believe, a J-2 ship, so we are talking about 6 - 12 weeks of
travel (depending on whether or not you allow straight jumps in your
campaign, I generally limit it to 2 before applying DMs to the misjump
roll due to lack of maintenance) as opposed to 2-3 weeks in a J-6.

I agree in principle that _a_ courier system, independant of the ISS
X-Boat system may exist.  More to the point, I think that such systems
have probably been developed several times over the life of the Imperium,
in response to events that _did_ affect the MegaCorps.  I just feel, that
after a period of time, as the costs were reflected at the bottom line, and
demand for the resources being used, exceeded the percieved need, it would
be broken up. (note - I am not talking about strictly J6 couriers, just
information flow faster than the x-boat network would provide.)  I
definitely agree that the major noble of the Empire keep couriers on
Sylea, and that _some_ minor nobles may also keep starships at hand (not
necessarily J6 tho\').  

Oh no!  That still fits canon!  :)

There have been a lot of races coming through with the ability to
terraform.  The Ancients used humans, and other races, as canaries - if the
critters survived, then the world was fit for Droyne.

Given the number of worlds in a typical system, there is almost certainly
going to be one that humans can survive on fairly easily.  (0.5-2G,
potentially tainted but survivable atmosphere, water.)  I figure that
probably 1/3 of all systems can support a TL0 culture as well as Earth can,
about 1/3 can do it with some difficulty, and a third have no decent worlds
by our standards, but by TL12 standards, they are just fine.  For us to
colonize Mars as a 1 billion+ pop world, for example, would be infeasible,
but for the 3I to do it, it is not that different than colonizing an
earthlike world.

Given a lot of planets which could be used, proximity to the high tech
worlds becomes more important.  Once you have local manufacture of TL9
goods, you can build J1 starships, so being J1 from a high tech world is
very, very important in the early days.

Tech levels quickly stabilize.  It takes centuries to advance in tech level
without help, while it takes a quarter the time with indifferent
assistance, and a tenth the time with active help.  This means that as soon
as a world has the economic power and the will, they will be very close to
their neighbors\' TL.

TL should be a tremendous draw - a factor of 4 in functionality of entire
systems over a tech level seems reasonable.  (Every system might not work
better, but a TL12 battle cruiser should be able to stomp 50 times as many
TL9 ships reasonably before destruction.)  Some tech level changes are so
major as to completely invalidate earlier tech.  TL9 grav, fusion, and
jump.  TL 12 fusion+ and meson guns.  TL16 antimatter, AIs, disintegrators
and matter transport.  TL19 pocket universes, gravitic weapons, white
globes, and individual high power psionic connections.

Being able to build those on worlds within a jump one is going to be
important, and a world will eventually tire of the shipping cost.  (When it
breaks the bank to bring in a modern weapon, the extra shipping cost is
trivial.  This is not the case when it becomes a margin game.)

As a result, a one tech level step implies a huge trade potential, to the
extent that the low tech world is willing to allow it.  Smart low tech
worlds only trade renewable resources, and accept a slower advance, knowing
that they can advance four tech levels in the time it takes the nearby
worlds to go even one.

Further, high pop worlds are such incredible resources that they run the
universe.  I play it that 2.5% of all worlds are pop A, 5% pop 9, and the
rest are either nearly empty, or have an average population of 10-100
million.  I know the list disagrees with this, but I am playing that an
economy needs millions of people to maintain TL8, hundreds of millions for
TL12, and billions for TL15.  (Not on the same world, just the same free
trade zone.)  This way, they can maintain TL8 or less without a problem,
and can maintain TL9-12 given even one high pop world nearby, or a number
of smaller ones.

Given the benefits of high population and low density, I expect that many
systems are looking to expand into their own system.  Jump drives are
cheap, but normal space is cheaper.  It is economically feasible to ship
raw ores across normal space, which I would be surprised if it was a good
idea to do that with jump ships.

T2300 had a mech type vehicle in the Equipment Guide.  That\'s about as

But, I have often thought of having a certain planet, or pocket empire,

I could see the indwelling ones, though that carries its own infection risk
that the men wouldn\'t have to deal with. 

Had a thought: What about some kind of vacuum device like what they 
use on the Shuttle? I saw a program where one of the astronauts was 
demonstrating the bathroom and showed the various "attachments" they
use, each astronaut with their own individual one that they attach to the
end of a vacuum hose basically. I can\'t imagine switching on the vacuum
every now and then would create any more noise than a powered suit 
itself would, and if the funnel is tailored to the individual, it wouldn\'t 
need adhesives, the vacuum would prevent leaks.

In addition, the machinery would give the women an even larger cod-
piece than the men, which would give some opponents food for thought....

My take on this is that Computer Software Engineering in the Far Future
is finally advanced to the point where software design is quite robust.
Things that require heavy computation have been maximally optimized.

Modifications to programs can occur in a semi-volitile subprocess. The
main "system" code cannot be overwritten or modified, but a clone can be
spawned within the system. A virtual computer within a computer.

It has been said that if Civil Engineering was at the same state of
advancement as Software Engineering, a bridge would collapse every 4
minutes. (or was it seconds?)

In the far future Software Engineering has advanced to the point where
GPFs are a footnote in history. Completely protected memory and process
threads, multiple redundancy and cross-checking to ensure results are
accurate, and other advanced features ensure that output is "correct"
and the computer is "stable".

I\'m not saying that problems won\'t occur, any more than I could assert
that bridges never collapse, I\'m just saying that *if* the computer
wonks out, you wouldn\'t call a helpdesk, you\'d call a "clean-up" crew,
or physically replace this or that.

Astrogators have a lot to do and worry about. They have to calculate
trajectories, keep themselves appraised of current sensor readings,
anticipate and create different contingency plans, monitor and record
various information about the ship\'s current position and vector, blah
blah yadda yadda.

I agree with those who have said that copy protection has advanced to

it\'s worth.

According to Vilani Law, patents and copyrights never expire. They are
held by the Megacorporation in perpetuity. Only the appropriate
professions are even allowed to license them.

I can\'t remember that the Imperial Judicial system has been discussed.
It seems to me that the Judicial system would rest heavily on the power
of the Nobility, and that it would be a very small and specific system.

Most Laws are local and depend on the local World\'s judicial system, the
Imperium only bothers to get involved in the big, interstellar stuff:
Murder in space (not on a world), interstellar trade, perhaps financial
tampering of ImpCr, that sort of thing.

(and an example using the Definitive Sensor Rules); sensor sizes are taken
from FFS2, sensor calculations use the DSR.

The sensor installation at a moderate-TL world would have both active and
passive components. The main military early warning sensor would be a
passive sensor, probably in far (400,000 km) orbit around the main world.
For a moderate-population TL-12 world, it might be a PEMS-15 or so; 
this has a surface area of 10000 m2 and costs MCr 50,000 (expensive, but
not ludicrous for the main planetary line of defence.) 
It\'s capable of tracking a typical target (a 100-ton ship with no 
particular ECM) out to ranges of 500,000,000 km or so. 

This would be supplemented by active arrays - and the main civilian
traffic control system would probably actually be an active sensor. This
is because although active sensors have shorter ranges, for traffic control
they can be combined with transponders - transmitters on every ship that
respond to the active sensor pulse - which gives much greater range and 
provides detailed information (registry, velocity, range, etc.) for 
cooperative targets. The traffic control sensor might be a AEMS-13 or so,
with a surface area of 2500 m2, requiring 2500 MW of power, and a cost
of MCr 5,000 (plus support hardware.) It\'d probably be located on the planet.
It could see targets directly out to around 5,000,000 km, but could see
transponder returns all through the system. (Modern tracking networks
can see the dinky little transponders on Pioneer or Voyager all the way to
the edge of the solar system...)
There *might* be a military AMES-13.5 as well (MCr 50,000) but there
might not. 

There would be lesser sensor arrays scattered throughout the system. 
Invidual high-traffic asteroids or secondary worlds would have their own
traffic control AEMS. Military installations would have secondary
PEMS arrays - PEMS-14.5 or 14. There might be a second big PEMS-15 
somewhere out at the edge of the system for tracking possible targets in
the Oort cloud. Big warships woul dhave a PEMS-14.5 and AEMS-13;
SDB\'s would have about a PEMS-14.


Some relevant examples: a scout/courier has IR and radar signatures of 0.
So, if it were out around 100 diameters (range of 11.5) the big military
sensor array would see a signal of 15 + 0 - 11.5 = 3.5, automatic
detection. It\'s hard to hide from big sensors. If it were out somewhere
in the asteroid belt (range of 14), the big military array would see a
signal of 15 + 0 - 14 = 1, an Average task every hour for the military
array to detect the ship.

If the scout had advanced IR masking (IR signature -1) and had its power
plant shut down (an additional -1 to signature), at 100 diameters it
would be a signal of 15 - 1 - 1 - 11.5 = 1.5 - there\'d be at least a
slight chance of being missed, particularly if the military sensor operators
weren\'t very good. If you\'re using the advanced version of my Definitive
Sensor Rules, you could try tricks like coming in from the direction of the
sun (-0.5) and agressive baffling (turning all the radiators away from the
hostile sensor) (-1.0) for a total signal of 15 - 1 -1 -1 -0.5 - 11.5 = 0;
an Impossible task for the military sensor operators. The disadvantage is
that your overheated radiators are easily visible to any other ships passing
nearby. The traffic control sensor would still see the
ship, too (13 + 0 - 0.5 - 11.5 = 1.0) unless the ship had a couple of levels
of radar stealthing.

I don\'t think the objections are based in any way on what
the clans are involved in.  It\'s based on the point that
either you have a male dominated society with very strong
gender roles or you have a society that is more like the
standard human society where the society is simply "mostly"
male controlled.  If you have clans that are dominated by
females and this is accepted to the point were a nomenclature
has developed to classify them, then you really aren\'t that
different than most human societies.

>The non-traditional clans don\'t have to be
>female-dominated, they just have to be, well, non-traditional. That\'s what
>I was trying to come up with;

I have no problem with variation.  Just with contradicting the
fundamental premise of the society.  If you have a clan that
is so heavily involved in things that are female roles, then
the males may not be able to understand the important issues and
be relagated to choosing which females suggestions to rubber stamp
and anything but general policy issues.  This is similar to
a GURPS Traveller I ran where jumping involved setting up
the jump drive (using Engineering) and then just sitting back
and letting it work.  However, since piloting the ship was a
male task, they had a big red button that said "jump" and
which they pushed when it lit up.  The male basically pushes
the button to confirm what has been done.

Corps could work either way.  If they are subordinate to clans,
it might be seen that this alone is sufficient male leader ship
allowing a female CEO to "manage" it.  OTOH, it might be seen
as necessary to to have a male to "lead" the corp.  (Esp. if
the corps was come sort of interclan cooperation or whatever).

Well, no, a bullet is not a lifting body, and in a gravity field follows
a ballistic path, ie: if you fire a rifle with zero elevation, the bullet
rises above the point of firing.

Lifting bodies are large blunt airfoils, which work as all airfoils do, by
offering a different path to air travelling over the surfaces generating
pressure differences via the bernoulli effect. A bullet
offers a symmetrical surface to oncoming air, and so never generates lift.
More to the point it is spinning at a hig rate of speed, so the flow of
air along its surface follows a _curved_ path which offsets pressure
differences that do arise. This is one reason a spun
projectile is stable in air, particularly for slowly spinning low velocity
projectiles, such as footballs for instance. (American footballs, that it,
pointy things made of pig ;)

In a vaccuum you get longer range because you don\'t have air resistance,
but you still get a ballistic path.

Of course this is all from my old physics, so I may have some details
wrong. (Except for the bullet rtrajectory part...that I _do_ know, having
fired black powder rifles, which have a far more pronounced trajectory due
to their lower muzzle velocity and greater weight)

I\'ve seen you get flamed on this in years past, Phil, so I\'m not going to
light my blowtorch! <g>

I referee one TNE campaign and play in another. My referee agrees with you
to a point. We recently had an adventure that began at the naval base at
Usani/Deneb. The world is TL 12, but because there is such a thing as
interstellar freight, he ruled that most, if not all, naval bases in the
Regency are TL 14-15. He set Usani\'s at 15.

As for the World Builder\'s Handbook extrapolation of TLs, I think it\'s
great. The novelty TL is the wildcard that any referee can use to supplant
the local TL with whatever the highest *nearby* TL is.

	IMHO not drop tanks in FFS or high guard are non canon, but
	the TAS article is. The normal FFS drop tank is nothing more

What!?  Surely you jest.  Or, you have a wrong impression of me.

I do like my core rules to be the official rules, but I change them all
the time.  I tweak here, and I tweak there.

Right now, my rules set consists of T4 basic rules, modified by the
KBv2.0 task system.

I use all of the chargen systems from all the versions except TNE.  I
use all of the skills and equipment from every version.

I\'m shopping hit location systems right now, and I\'m looking at a MT hit
location system I found in a Traveller\'s Digest, Glenn Grant\'s system,
and a 2 D6 version of the hit location system in TNE.

I just incorporated tactical combat into the game, and I\'m using CT\'s
Snapshot rules for that.

I haven\'t picked a starship combat system yet, but I am looking
seriously at the RPSCS system designed by all the good folks on the TML,
Brilliant Lances, and even Mayday.

When I need a particular rule for something, I look it up in all of the
editions.  CT, T4, and MT take presedence, but I\'ll convert rules from
TNE if I have to (which is going to be the case for my
cybernetics--since the T4 edition of FF&S does not include them).

I also use ideas, sparingly, from T2300.

On top of all of this, my adventures are definitely not all Traveller. 
I\'ll convert from Gamma World, Space Master, Space Opera, T2300, Star
Fronties, etc., and I do this more than occasionally.

I usually use the official Traveller adventures as the backbone, and
fill in the details with one of these other adventure modules.

For example, just recently, my players reached Pysadi in the Aramis
subsector of the Spinward Marches.  We are playing the Traveller
Adventure.

But, here\'s my twist.  When the characters got there, they found that
the deep space autodrone, far away from Pysadi deep system, was under
attack from some unknown alien species.

The autodrone is Pysadi\'s key to improving their standing within the
subsector.  They are only TL4, and there was a big stink some years ago
when an Imperial politician/noble got caught up in Pysadi\'s
aguarian/religious way of life.  He changed his name (like Casus Clay
changing his name to Muhommad Ali because of his religion), quit his
post, and came to live on Pysadi.

There, he got involved in making "Mother Pysadi" better than she already
was by using his influence within the Imperial government to petition
for an autodrone.

The autodrone is a TL 15, fully automated space station. It\'s only 500
tons, and it can be fitted with different types of equipment.  In this
case, our Pysadian convert, Professor Mir, equiped it with orbit to
surface planetary sensors.

Mir\'s plan was this--prospect for lanthanum deposits in the system\'s
outer planets (which other research had told him there was a strong
possiblilty) which are virtually unexplored.

This autodrone is Pysadi\'s hope for the future.  A viable lanthanum mine
could provide Pysadi with enough exports to put the system on the
map--especially with all of the sabre rattling going between the
Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate (The year is 1105--the eve of the
FFW, and the Imperium is locked in an arms race).

Well, our heroes get to Pysadi, and they are in a turmoil.  They\'ve
received this message that the station is under attack by an unknown
alien force, and the message is three days old!  It takes time to
communicate that far outsystem.

There is no Scout Base.  There is no Navy Base.  And, Pysadi, being TL
4, has no way of mounting a rescue mission.

Guess who they turn to.  Yes, that\'s right.  My players had the fight of
their lives.

Now, when it comes to converting rules, take a look at this adventure. 
Pysadi is in the Traveller Adventure, but nothing about what I\'ve said
is in there.  That\'s all me being a creative GM.

The autodrone, I got from an old Space Master mini-adventure.  The
aliens?  They were Kafers from T2300!  In this case, they are an unknown
alien race from the Far Frontier sector.  The Zhos found them in a
pre-historical state.  Using their psionics to communicate with them,
the Zhos sped them to be controlled warriors for the Consoluate--kinda
like the Gem\'hadar are in Star Trek.

The plot?  The Zhos are gearing up for the FFW invasion.  They need
intelligence, but they don\'t want to risk starting the conflict too
early--they can\'t send in Zho regulars.

Instead, they send in the Kafers--a race the Imperium knows little about
and has no idea the Zhos are behind it.

The plan is to check out this top secret autodrone in the Pysadian
system.  They want the data logs to see if lanthanum has been found.

Given that it has, the Zhos plan the invasion.  They plan their first
strikes, but they also need forward bases.  You take a little ground,
you need logistics to keep you moving.  If lanthanum is in the Pysadian
system, then this system would be ideal for the FFW invasion.  

In the initial strike, they push deep and take a few world.  The second
wave takes the Pysadian system.  It is undefended--no Naval or Scout
base, and there are two gas giants insystem.  The Zhos use this system
as a staging area for deeper thrusts into the Marches. 

Before you know it, they are in the Rhylanor subsector.

Now, I\'ve combined my own creativity, CT\'s the Traveller Adventure, a
Space Master mini-adventure, and aliens from T2300.

How\'s that for conversion?

Yes, my thinking was that the source of heating would be almost the same 
whether or not one had atmosphere, but any weapon in rapid fire that was
normally "air" cooled would run into problems.

	My economic house rule states that with increasing techlevel 
	diversification also increase, and that you need the synergy
	of a (10^TL)/(2^MaintModifier) population to build this
	techlevel, even if you have higher theoretical knowledge.
	Because of this, you need a lot of trade to build Tl 12.

	TL 12 needs (10^12)/(2^6)=15000 million people.

	We currently have about 900 million people so we can
	build Tl10 - if we could educated anybody to at least
	Tl8 standarts. I only count 3 techlevels called military,
	advanced, and civlian anything below is subsumed as backwater.

	You of course have to distinct this "brutto techlevel"
	with the "netto techlevel" and the "scout techlevel".

	The brutto techlevel is those theoretical value.
	The netto techlevel of an economie on continent, world,
	subsector, or imperial level is the techlevel for
	export goods.  While the scout techlevel (in the UWP)
	is only a measurement of how good the starport is.

	- If the scouts would take a look on current terror@sol,
	  they would tell that we are TL7, even if our potencial
	  is Tl10, and even if we sell them some Tl8 goods. As
	  long as those goods are non space related, and we can
	  not sustain Tl8 system (defense) boat production or
	  repair, they would\'nt call us Tl8. If we hav\'nt Shuttle
	  and Mir they\'ll call us Tl6. I think anytime a new
	  scout report is published a free traders network patch
	  is released after some weeks, to reflect the netto
	  techlevel.

	The reason for transporting junk with a jump ship, is that
	as long as the hinterworld is below civilan standart techlevel,
	his population is not counted for the synergy potencial. So
	if you want to push the third world with high tech export,
	you have to import bananas or rocks.

	What do you prefer diamonds from Namibia, or bananas from
	Ruanda ? Oh bananas are a novellity perhaps its make its mark,
	while diamonds are cheap industrial produceable at higher
	techlevels. Its allways better to have the cargo bay half full
	of organic junk, and half of anorganic junk, than to drive
	empty ;-)

Why was the PoD so devistating?!  Well just imagine as contact with the
Terrans was anticipated, the Vilani all began x-boat (or insert
perferred communication method) messaging each other arguing about how
devistating the plague would be....the people x-boated then x-boated
back a reply that, no, in fact the effects of contact with the Terrans
would be trivial as only a few thousand Vilani on each of the 10000
Vilani worlds would die and therefore you have a better chance of
winning the lottery----even if you didn\'t buy a ticket.  These repeated
exchanges eventually took up so much jumpwidth that it eventually became
impossible for any real communications to be conducted..i.e.  THE
TERRANS ARE COMING.  The collapsing of the communication net plus the
excessive expendature of limited planetary resources (for the running of
computer terminals late into the night as the next chapter of the
ongoing argument was typed--on less technologically advanced worlds,
whole forests were leveled to make paper) proved to be more than the
crumbling Vilani infrastucture could handle.  Planets then fell into
isolation, yet the arguments continued on a planetary level and gobbled
up what resources remained.  Eventually, when all the resources were
gone the Vilani just sat and waited.  Tensions mounted.  Thousand of
Vilani on each world died from starvation and exposure. When the Terrans
did finally arrive all stood in amazement as no plague befell them.  Who
would have believed that the Terrans come from behind jump technology
would bath them in low level radiaion that had the effect of killing off
all of the terrible microbes that would have infected the Vilani.  As it
was the Vilani were so happy not to be dropping like flies that it was a
cake walk to get the Vilani leadership to sign a contract giving the
Terrans rule over them----

	The TML is what you\'re reading now.

	Famille Spofulam LIC are a non-canonical family-run mini-megacorp
that I cooked up a while back; they\'re the fictional background for the
various weapon, vehicle, and starship designs that I do.  CEO is the
somewhat sinister family patriarch Hengabar Spofulam, their business
practices are under continual investigation by Imperial authorities, and
the rumours that their design bureau is a hotbed of substance abuse are
rife.  Incidents such as their recent Patrol Cruiser THUDDD submission, and
the placement of the owner\'s san on their Imelda-class yacht do nothing to
alleviate this image problem.

	 Furthermore, their practice of unpaid apprenticeships for the
younger members of the family is the subject of an ongoing smear campaign
by the Sylean Bureau of Youth Protection, and they are _loathed_ by every
single consumer and product safety lobby group in the Imperium, especially
Mothers Against Grav Cycle Carnage.


	Some of their better-known products include a Fusion+ powered
T-plate propelled pogo stick capable of reaching orbit at 8 G\'s if the
parental safety overrides are hacked, a 6.66 mm gauss hunting rifle with
6,000 m/s muzzle velocity, the Caligula-class 1000td megayacht, a 20mm
gauss hand cannon,  and the Moonshine-class smuggl..., er, Rapid
Insertion/Extraction Starship (does 9G, stealthed, the works).

	If you like I can send you some of them...

   Which every knows is never going to happen.  Marx had his moments
(had the Western cultures not had the ability to reform themselves, he
would have been right about a great deal more), but in light of
experience, many of his works read like bad science-fiction today.

   An excellent post, but be sure that you don\'t confuse Socialism and
Communism.  The former is an economic system while the later is a
political one.  Communists tend to espouse socialist economic policy
(especially centralized socialism), but as we have seen in China, the
two are mutually exclusive concepts.  Countries such as Spain, Sweden,
and Greece on the opposite end have socialistic (semi-socialist)
economies but are democracies.

   All this brings up the question, "is the Imperium a capitalist
society?"  True enough there is a large degree of local political
autonomy, but wouldn\'t the basic priniciples under which the Imperium is
founded tend to force member worlds to include themselves in
interstellar trade and therefore open their markets?  It would be next
to impossible to run a centralized, planned economy under those
conditions.

Harold

I beg to differ. First of all, dipole forces drop off as an inverse cube. I
believe you can get inverse-fourth and higher powers with suitably arranged
quadrapoles and such.

Moreover, all this applies only to *point sources*. There are plenty of
other things in this universe aside from point sources. With suitable
engineering you can get just about any force law you want.

Cr100 is way too high, if your campaign involves much combat, but how much 
constitutes one "dose"?  Is one dose enough to hold together a single 
critical plasma wound to the chest?  It should cost more than gauze and an 
ace bandage, but probably more like Cr20.

Cr300 or Cr400 sounds reasonable for Fuzz (which color tab was this in 
TNE, or did it take both to get this effect?).

I\'d make both of them TL8+...  Bandage may not sound like much at first 
glance, but it really is like having a first aid skill without requiring 
one.

Between MW and MT/HT/TNE perhaps...  Not CT/T4...  But that\'s just 
ambiance.  The rules are nothing like Traveller, although I would like to 
see the gearheads take on myomer tech and port it into FF&S2...  I\'ve 
always thought that there weren\'t enough good "walkers" in Traveller.

Have at it!  And share your tribulations (I hope they\'re few, but I doubt 
it).  MW was basically a poor attempt by FASA to bolt-on RPG capabilities 
to Battletech et al, IMO.  But I\'m interested to see where your synthesis 
takes you.

How are you going to integrate battlemechs into the Traveller *feel* of 
things?  Dropships are pretty much reserved, it seems, for huge trading 
conglomerates and military actions.  The Battletech universe isn\'t much 
fun for anyone but \'Mech pilots anyway.  "You pull out your cZ@&% pistol 
and brandish it bravely toward the oncoming Warhammer.  He ignores you and 
continues razing the city...  Might I suggest that the party run for the 
dropship?"

The MW Mercenaries handbook has some great ideas, though, and most FASA 
products have excellent artwork.

I wish our (T4) starships had paintjobs as cool as the average battlemech 
(or tank from T2k for that matter).  *sigh*  <unrelated ramble> I think 
Chris has a lot of talent, but I don\'t like my starships (except maybe 
Vargr) to look like throwbacks to American cars of the 1950s...  Tail 
fins?  Really...  More cloud-creatures that appear to be eyeing grav 
cities for lunch!!!</unrelated ramble>

The one I heard was:

A fellow was making a killing selling magic tablets that would let you run
your car on water. Expensive, sure, but you never had to pay for gas again!
He could show you a car that ran on it, and if you were still skeptical he
let you try it out first; he would let you pick the car, inspect it as much
as you like, empty the gas tank and fill it with water, then he\'d drop in a
tablet. And it worked, too. You could drive the car around.

So why do we still buy gasoline instead of tablets? Apparently the tablets
were acetone, a volatile water-soluble chemical used for making explosives.
The water was blown into steam and acted simply as a displacement gas. The
inside of the engine got "blown into steam" as well, and I imagine his
customers would be calling tow trucks after driving a few blocks.

Yep, so I did.  Originally, when the germ of the idea first infected me,
the idea was that they were more in coreward-spinward space, near the
Zhodani Consulate.  That has its own appeal, but makes the Hiver influence
a little hard to swallow.  Doesn\'t matter, really.

I think I may just do that -- \'course, if they get rowdy and misbehave, you

It\'ll be a week or so.  Right now, I\'m trying to do something constructive
with & to Vilani verbs, for the third time.  Which, according to the

It basicly depends on how fast your radiators cool off. I *think* that
the cooling will follow an inverse 4th power law.

Don\'t forget that the beam (actually several "synchronized" beams) is
bounced off a *steerable* mirror, as the ship needs sideways velocity,
not just a "straight up" boost.

So for defense, you either "over design" the mirror actuators so that
it can slew *fast*, or you have an "extra" mirror for each laser in the
launch system (thus turning one launch laser into a dozen or so defense
lasers at lower power).

Remember that the original designs had the component lasers doubling as
ABM lasers. And the power generation capacity required is pretty
significant. Add some storage capacity to level out the drops when the
lasers are being used for launching, and you can sell a lot of power.
Or else set up some industries that take lots of power but can either
handle the dropouts or schedule around them (electrical "smelting" type
ops can be set up so that you could drop most of the (heating) power
for as much as 15 minutes out of the hour).

Well, I rather expect that at major hubs there are a *lot* of private
and public stations out there at the 100 dia limit. For example, if
cargo is just "passing thru", why bother hauling it to even high orbit
if you don\'t have to?

And for courier work, 100 dia limit stations make too much sense. 

BTW, remember, this isn\'t a "point". It\'s the surface of a *huge*
sphere. And ships coming *out* of jump can be quite a ways away.
Remember, a one hour slip in exit time means a 108,000 km position
difference for a planet that orbits at 30 km/sec.

I figure that it makes more sense to have a station out there with the
ship docked to it. It costs more, but it\'s more flexible.

Excuse me? If they are "just outside the jump point", that means that
they are not *between* the systems. They are *in* one of them. Also,
you seem to think that there is "a" jump point. Sorry, but you can jump
from *anywhere* on the surface of a sphere 100 planetary diameters in
radius (and from points outside it). With Marc\'s "straight line" idea,
you only wind up excluding a relatively *small* patch on one side of
the sphere.

Just *this* means that the possible starting points cover an area 2.8
*million* km across (assuming a size 7 planet).

If the sensors *are* "between" the systems, then you *are* dealing with
the entire orbital spread.

Sorry, doesn\'t work. Because those *same* maps are *also* supposed to
be maps of N-space. For example, the folks who settled the Island
Clusters in the Great Rift got there via several centuries of *slower*
than light travel. No J-space involved.

Thus, J-space and N-space have the same dimensionality. Also, mapping
functions for mapping 2d-3d are *not* continous functions. So you\'d get
a real mess. The 2d map and the 3d map don\'t match up in a "sensible
way" (that is, distance on one map *doesn\'t* give you any idea of
distance on the other).

Detectable above the "noise" caused by every moving mass on the ship,
every source of vibration, etc. Gravity is a *weak* force.

Which means that you had to know *in advance* that a particular ship
was going to take that course. So at the very least, you can only talk
to a ship that is on a *scheduled* run *and* is on schedule to a matter
of milliseconds (so you can emit the signal at the time the ship is
passing) And given the official spread in duration of a jump, assuming
the ship moves at a constant velocity, you can\'t even predict *where*
it\'ll be at any given time.

Every published map of star systems is 2d also. And as noted above, the
maps of stars are supposed to be *N-space* maps. Besides the Island
Clusters, we also have the evidence of the Maghiz. The massive flare on
Darrian\'s sun propogated thu *normal* space to affect the worlds that
are nearby on those same 2d maps.

Except that as I note above, again and again we find that the maps of
stars are *N-space* maps. And the stars adjacent in N-space are
adjacent in J-space. (Third example: the stars near Sol in J-space are
the ones near it in N-space).

As for the mapping, *I* was one of the folks pointing out that you
*could* map a 3d space onto a 2d space. But as I also pointed out, the
results are of interest *only* to topologists.

*Projections* of a higher space onto a lower always involve
distortions. 1-1 mappings are so distorted that the results aren\'t
useful as a "map" in the normal sense. "Mapping" in math means
something a *lot* different.

This reminds me of a lovely idea from a book I just read.

The latest Miles Vorkosigan book is out in paperback. "Memory". The
short description in the timeline is "Miles hits thirty. Thirty hits
back."  

Anyway, I won\'t give away the plot. But Bujold introduces us to a "new"
feature of the Barrayan empire. The "Imperial Auditor". Think of a
cross between an Inspector General and a double-0 agent. Sort of like a
"Special Prosecutor". These are the folks the Emperor sends when he
wants *answers*. The have the authority to do just about *anything*.

There are permanently appointed ones, and a provision for "temporary"
ones. The "temps" only serve for one investigation.

I *like* the concept. And I think it\'d fit nicely into the Imperium. 

Read the book to get a better idea of the way the office works.

For the "expert system" type programs (like gunnery), you change the
"rules" it uses, not the program itself. And likely, the program would
work it both ways (standard rules and modified) so you could see if
your changes were better than the stock stuff.

For a good example of the man-machine interaction on something like
this, check out the sections of Heinlein\'s "Citizen of the Galaxy"
where Thorby is a gunner on the Sisu. The computer is figuring course
tracks and possible firing solutions. The gunner keeps feeding it "what
if" ideas ("What if he does *this*?", "What if I do *that*?").
Sometimes the computer\'s logical projections give the firing solution,
sometimes the gunner\'s intuitive projections do.

Also, some "tweaking" may be along the lines of "tweaking" the ROM in
your car\'s engine computer. A lot of folks by the tweaked chips to
increase performance. Of course, this also increases pollution. So the
car makers are making it harder to mess with the chips. 

Still, when dealing with something like a starship or even commercial
aircraft/spacecraft, I\'d imagine that part of the engineering skills
involves knowing how to read the specs for the code and use the
maintenance gear to "tune" things for the specific idiosyncracies of
your installation (*Nothing* that complex can be "identical"). But this
is more like tuning an engine than programming. You\'d be updating
tables and possibly modifying "rules". It\'d be a lot different from
what we generally think of as programming.

> Has perpetual betaware been done away with?

Consider that we\'ve been writing in "high level" language for about 4
decades. And "programming" for about a century (counting Babbage, and
not counting a lot of the period between when he gave up and folks
re-invented the idea).

When we\'ve been doing this for several *millenia*, we ought to do a
much better job.

Consider the idea that the software has been getting the bugs removed
for several *centuries*. Having a bug show up is an *extremely* rare
occurence. Not like the current mess where we have hardware bugs,
firmware bugs, software bugs, and poor integration between different
subsystems.

likely.

Again, the software will have been doing this for *centuries, on
millions if not *billions* of ships. In the (extremely unlikely) case
that the software *is* responsible, you\'d have to get back to sue.

Not if it is properly written. And given the millenia of experience, I
rather suspect that the hardware *and* software will be "provably
correct". This is done now for systems that *can\'t* go wrong. It\'s
expensive and time consuming. But given that the basic computer
architecture doesn\'t change for *centuries* (rather than every six
months like now), this is likely the way they\'d go. If for no other
reason than to avoid being sued!

("Provably correct" means that every possible state of the cpu has been
checked and that the software logic and code have been thru the
equivalent. Think of it as trying every *possible* input and verifying
that the output is correct for those inputs. There *are* shortcuts that
keep it from taking forever, but it is tedious.

> * What do astrogators really do with all of their spare time?  Or on the

I\'ve done postings on this before. In essence, in system he is busy
checking the ship\'s position and course against both "charts" and
sensors to make sure that not only is the ship heading in the right
direction, but also that it never has a "projected course" that points
somewhere bad (like into "restricted" space owned by the Navy).

He also has to calculate the jump. And while in jump, he\'s gonna spend
at least some time reviewing the charts and navigational info (Notices
to Spacefarers, etc) for the destination. 

Upon exit from jump, the first thing he does is try to locate the
planet. He\'s also checking the star for distance and spectral readings.
If the spectrum checks he\'s pretty sure he\'s in the right system. If
not, he starts the computer trying to match the spectrum so he can find
out where he is. Meanwhile, the ship is trying to contact local traffic
control.

Assuming he *is* in the right place, he either locates the planet, or
the sensors beat him to it by locking onto a nav beacon. Then he steers
the ship towards a normal approach while waiting for specific course
assignment from traffic control.

This is partly an artifact of the *kind* of computer and program.
There\'s a lot of stuff out there that\'s "built in". And you\'d never
think about messing with it. Se the bit above about car computers and
ROMs.

It can take a long time. But remember, "trade secret" is a *very*
restricted class. It can only apply to things not easily reverse
engineered, and the "secret" has to be kept to a limited number of
people inside your company. If someone outside figures it out on his
own, you can\'t do a damn thing about it. If someone inside leaks it,
you can sue them for breach of contract and other such things.

Patent cases get messy. Often the patent gets invalidated!

Lots.

> into the public domain?

Currently patents are a 17(?) year term. Non-renewable. Copyright is 75
years (for corporations) or the life of the author plus 75 years (for
individuals). Also non-renewable.

Again, consider how long it is between tech level changes. The software
is going to be pretty damn stable. People will have settled what the
appropriate "bells and whistles" are a long time ago. Extra features
will be stock modules, with known behavior. In the *rare* case you come
up with a new idea, they can do the custom programming, but they\'ll be
able to check interactions *far* better than we can.

Good question. Frankly, I\'d hope that jury pay is *at least* minimum
wage. And that they have *some* means of making sure that the jurors
are "informed", rather than some of the (a bit *too*
ignorant/uneducated) types we get now.

I had brought over my BattleTech game to a Traveller session once.
The ref used a few mechs... We had found this old base that housed
these strange old battle robots. It was fun trying to get them to
work. Then we used it to attack our foe (I forget the details).
It was amusing. Only did it once.  :-)

The ISBA was set up by Sir Josephanoer Califor and Myself nearly a year 
ago.(Founder Shipworks & X-TEK Industries)  The membership list is quite 
huge, but we are always accepting new members.

Companies in the ISBA come in all shapes sizes and specialties, Famille 
Spofulam has been described in some detail, I think it fair to describe my 
company as well :)

My Company (X-TEK) Specilizes in mostly military hardware and small, fast 
ships with big guns.  We are like Spofulam in that respect, but whereas they 
specilise in the personal arms department, X-TEK specilises in Starship 
Armament.  Things like the 10ton Meson Pod for 30ton Fighters and 100ton 
Assault scouts, and our latest development, the EPC Detonation Plasma 
Warhead for Missiles.  Its main cliam to fame is its deep space research, 
development and shipbuilding facility (and fully functioning Starport!) 
called "Planet X"

A "Sensor Guru" joining the ISBA would be most welcome.  We could use some 
new Q/SSDS sensor "packages" for small ships as they are laking in the 
current lists.

My Co-Founder Sir Josephanoer Califor(Tim Reynolds) maintains the ISBA site 
at the following address:

http://www.premier.net/~tim/ISBA.HTM

From there are links to various other sites, "Company" websites, the THUDDD 
pages, and ISBA history and information.

0.125% (1/800th) of the ship\'s value per week if it is not put into danger; 
add the cost of insurance (value of ship * risk of loss) if it is. That will 
cover bank payments and a return of investment for the owner. Operating 
expenses (crew salaries, life support, and fuel) are not included in that
figure.

If the ship is going into dangerous territory it may not be possible to get
insurance. You\'d have to work out with the owner how much he should get to
put the ship in danger. An agreement to replace the ship if it is lost
should always be sufficient, but can become very expensive (and require
a LARGE bond!).

I too have been surprised by the number of Piper fans that I encounter on

I have been working on collecting all of H. Beam Piper\'s works. I have lived

Piper lived and worked in Williamsport, PA and I find a lot of good copies 
of his books is the used book swaps.

FWIW, my favorite local shop had copies of Uller Uprising, Federation, 
Empire, Four Day Planet/Lone Star Planet, First Cycle, and a bunch of the 
Fuzzies I can\'t recall.

Since I\'ve got all the copies of these I want, I\'ll gladly put any 
interested TMLer in touch with the shop owner.

BTW, If anyone has spare 1980\'s Ace Edition of Lord Kalvan (the one with the 
Whelan cover) I\'ll buy or trade for it.

Oh! Me Too!

> * How do you call the helpdesk when you\'re gunnery program GPFs?

Well, what do you do when your car\'s computer-controlled carburetor
GPFs? Or when your computer-aided gas chromatograph GPFs?

Basically, the GPF is a type of fault the is really only found
in extremely shitty software and primarily on desktop-type PCs where
nothing going on is so important that it can\'t be interrupted for
a few minutes.

If we look at phone switches on the other hand, they have a specified
downtime of about 10-30 seconds per year. They\'re designed not to
do dumb stuff like SEGV-ing or GPF-ing. And guess what - they don\'t.

The GPF is a side-effect of a basic design assumption present in
almost all desktop software: "It\'s OK to GPF".  If the design document
says "No GPF-ing under any circumstances" then you can be pretty sure
it won\'t GPF. Please keep in mind that GE Defence Systems has a really,
really, REALLY different software development process than companies
like Microsoft or Intuit. 

GPF-ing is also a side-effect of programmers who use development 
environments that allow GPFs. You may note a distinct lack of 
GPF-type errors on systems developed using Smalltalk, ADA, COBOL,
Java, etc.

To explain, a GPF (General Protection Fault) is the same as the 
good ol\' UNIX SEGV error. Basically, what happens is that the program
has a pointer that points outside the program\'s own memory space
and then tries to access it. The memory management hardware traps
it, saving other processes, but killing the offender. It\'s not
that hard to deal with, really.

I\'d guess it would have the same games that they have on air

Really, starships won\'t be run by super-duper IBM PCs.
When thinking of how starship computers work, think of how the
computerized systems on an aircraft carrier bridge work.
They\'ll be pretty much alike in terms of what you can do with them
(lots) and to them (nothing).

I checked _TCS_ and the Imperial ship that misjumped into the Islands
Cluster during 3FW didn\'t use drop tanks to get back, it used auxiliary
tanks. Propably jumped back and forth several times and laid out fuel
depots. It would take time, but it could be done.

Flechette ammunition is not spin-stabilized, although some discarding
sabot ammo is.  Since the fins on a flechette are straight, imparting
a spin in the projectile would be counter-productive to it\'s accuracy.
If the penetrator does not possess fins, it would be spin-stabilized.

The sabot on some tank rounds house the finned penetrator in a bearing
assembly so that when fired from a conventionally rifled barrel, only
the sabot spins.

Right now I\'m designing with James Lindsay doing development.  CORE has
expressed an interest in publishing it on the net, although I\'m still
looking at options.

ACQ uses Action Points, and is based on my experiences and research into
personal combat.  One of the best bits of research I\'ve done was down at
the SFPD firing range with a couple of cop friends as we timed actions like
drawing and reloading to figure AP costs, then we did a lot of shooting...

I\'ve even bugged a martial artist friend on how many attacks he could make
in a 6 second period.  He offered to demonstate on me.

ACQ is on a little back burner due to another writing commitment, but We\'ll
have the next playtest version ready soon, hopefully.

Anyone wishing to contribute or playtest should contact me.

But that extrapolation is worth very little; it could be spot on or it could
be miles off. It is certainly not any kind of proof.

I never suggested that. The figure I suggested was 100 billion. After some
reflection I still think that I could defend such a figure, but it is 
about the lower limit that I consider possible and a somewhat higher
figure, somewhere between 100 and 200 billion, seems reasonable to me.

>Extrapolating back to somewhere around 100-500 billion is exceedingly 
>reasonable as far as I can see it!

Agreed, but the higher the figure you get, the higher the odds against the
Terrans and the more difficult it is to believe in their victory, however
decadent and divided the Imperium may have been. I\'m not saying that one
couldn\'t believe in 5 billion Terrans winning over 500 billion Vilani, but
it is far easier to believe in them vinning over 150 billion. So from that
point of view, the lower the figure the better.

The province of Kushuggi (Solomani Rim) constitute between 3 and 5% of the
area of the Siru Zirka (the higher figure if we postulate that the two
small bits of the SZ that lies in Magaar (Magyar) and Amkarin (Alpha
Crusis) are administered from Kushuggi). This province was about as
strong as Terra at some early point in the Interstellar Wars. But to
extrapolate any further from that is almost impossible, since we don\'t
know enough about Terra\'s infrastructure, the amount of taxes Kushuggi
paid to the centra treasury, what other problems the governor had to
deal with (how strong were the Vegans?), etc.

Thanks for pointing that out. You\'re right, that\'s a contradiction. I\'ve
checked the TD#20 article and it is clear that the figure of \'over a billion\'
deaths only refers to those caused by the Plague of Duskir, which here is
described as being caused by conquering Terran troops at the time of the
last Interstellar War (note that _S&A_ claims that the PoD was caused by
Terran immigrants to Vilani worlds).

I see no reason why part of the actual *starport* wouldn\'t be out there
at the 100 dia. limit. For Starports A and B especially, it would be
pretty standard for a world with a lot of outsystem trade to have a
highport at that distance.

After all, if goods are being sent out by jump, what would be the point
of a highport in low orbit, besides the nice view? If a "standing jump"
is the standard, it would be more time efficient to have the highport at
the 100 dia limit. There is just one decelleration phase, so the trip

orbit, you have two decellerations: from surface to port, then from port
to jump-point.

H. Beam Piper was an incredible author.  The only thing I find difficult
about his work (being in the computer industry myself) is his projections
of the computer field.  (sigh, I guess no one is perfect)

I have been hearing rumours for years that someone picked up the Space
Viking thread and wrote a second book.  Does anyone know if this is true?

This list would preselect for it.  I have never heard it confirmed, but it
always seemed obvious to me that the 800t Merc cruiser was modelled on the
ships in Space Viking, and other Piper stories.

Of course, given that those were 2000 ft spheres, they were at least 150
MT, and might have been as large as 1.2 GT.  Piper _liked_ big.

I am trying to pick an era that would fit well with the Federation era and
the various Empire eras.  I am thinking M0 is well suited for the genteel
Federation mentioned in Little Fuzzy, while the late 1090s- early 1100s
seems more like the creaking Federation in Cosmic Computer.

This brings up an interesting point...Who\'s in charge?

It is my understanding that the Imperium does not interfere on planets.
This is how we get the various Law Levels and Government Types from planet
to planet.

But the mainworld sets the tone for the entire system, and normally I\'ve
played the assorted planets of the system to be offshoots from the
mainworld (and the world generation tables tend to support this
viewpoint).

But it is also my understanding that the mainworlds sway does not extend
much past the atmosphere (I generally give the world sovereignty (sp?) to
5 orbits).

This also kind of hits me at another core point.  Who builds the
starports?  I\'ve always assumed that they are administered by the Imperium
(thus allowing for the much vaunted Imperial Extraterritorial Zone around
the port - but that may not be canon), but originally built and financed
by the planet and/or a major corporation or consortium of corporations.

So, what I\'m looking for is this:

1) If we put highports out beyond 5 diameters, who administers and/or
protects them?  Do they fall under direct Imperial jurisdiction?

- -and-

2) Who is responsible for building the starports?

The same option that law-abiding people have, just keep haunting used
bookstores, game shops and the like, maybe advertising in
rec.games.misc.forsale, and getting a copy legally.

I\'ve always been a great enthusiast of Photon drives.  From the HELL system to just a simple PHOTON Array aimed Aft.  
However I\'ve never been able to figure out the following:  How much LIGHT must be projected per TON of mass in order
to get X amount of acceleration?  Anyone know this.  I\'d be very appreciative.  Also one other quick question:
can increase Surface Area for the Photon drive be replaced by a reduced SA with increased Intensity?

	It depends on the level of radiation -- get it high enough and you can
cook a live hog whole in less than a minute -- it gets quite agitated
before it keels over cooked, or so I\'ve heard. You can do a mouse this way
in a standard microwave (quite messy) -- I believe a children\'s show host,
named Ghoulardi, did this in Cleveland or Detroit (moving almost
immediately thereafter to either Detroit or Cleveland). Mid-eighties, I
believe.

It seems clear to me that this is never going to happen on Earth.  Among
the 15,000 planets in the Imperium there are going to be hundreds of
planets with government type 0 (no governmnet).  It is not improbable
that some of these planets will formerly have had another type of
government. Different cultures will experience different cultural
changes.  Therefore I believe it is possible that the Imperium might
contain a planet with government type 0 that considers itself to be
communist.

No Communism _is_ an economic system as well as a political system and 
Socialism is a political system as well as an economic one using the
definitions used in poloitcal science and in economics.

Briefly communism (Marxist-Leninism) is the economic sytem that is
_supposed_ to occur in a communist society (a circular definition I\'ll
admit but blame Marx and the political scientists, not me).  This is the
sort of economic system described in Das Kapital (unreadable dreck but
thats not my point).  Socialism can be described as the set of political
beliefs that occur in countries where economic socialism is favored. 
Socialism is not a structural/functionist description of a government
similar to Traveller governmnet types but it can be a valid (but also
somewhat circular) description.

The post was about communism.  The point I was trying to make was that
the Traveller governmnet type table does not consider ideology, but only
the nature of the government (What they call a structural/functional
analysis in Political Science jargon.)  Therefore a planet that was
nominally communist could actually have any of the Traveller governmnet
types.  I admit I had to stretch a bit more in explaining away the lower
numbered governmnet types as communistic than I did for the higher
numbered ones.  I do not think that any of my explanations strained the
system nearly as much as you have to strain it to explain why you can
have planets the size of the moon (size 2) with earthlike (type 6)
atmospheres (barring Terraforming).

I think that the overall body of Traveller work (canon if you will) has
established that some planets are fairly isolated from the rest of the
Imperium.  Many of the planets that adventures have occured on, for
instance, have been somewhat isolated from overall Imperial society
(they probably had to be written like this so the adventure would work
but they are still canon). The planetary governmnet runs the planet
outside of the extrality zone.  If that planetary government will not
let the people within the extrality zone they will not have any
opportunity to engage in capitalism.  If the state run Bureau of Trade
does not ever buy any goods offered in the starport that are not in the
Five Year Plan to buy or sell any goods that are not in the Five Year
Plan to sell you could have a communist planet existing in a capitalist
Imperium in much the same way that the Soveit Unions government bought &
sold things capitalistically on the international market while still
mainitaining a communist ideology.  Traders coming to the planet would
either sell goods not on the list to each other, be unable to sell them,
or be able to sell them only at low rates (to the planets government)
part of whose Five Year Plan would/could include something like "In
order to ensure needed funds to buy arms to preserve the revolution from
foreign capitalist threat the Bureau of Trade shall, at its discretion,
purchase goods not speicifically in the Five Year Plan for later
resale."

I believe that Jerry Pournelle holds the rights to develop the Piper

Although, a Return of Space Viking would at least cause a reprint of the old

Hm, I think you misunderstand. Nortel has a few hundred engineers
writing code in C, C++ and Protel that goes into phone switches
and is then shut off from the outside world. If there is no console,
not even a dangling serial port, how are you going to hack the software
controlling the switch\'s actions?

Also, that "cheesy microcode" is worth more than most of us will ever
be. A phone switch is pretty damn complicated. I honestly believe
that a modern, large-scale, network backbone phone switch is one of
the single most complicated monolithic artifacts ever created by 
mankind. All praise the mighy phone switch. Long live SS7.

I believe it depends on the plane. Civilian planes vary - some planes are
all hydraulics and wire, while others (Airbus I think) are totally fly-by-wire.
I really don\'t know much about military planes, except that they\'re probably
more complex than civilian ones.

Damn straight it\'s a pain to update. The harder it is to update,
the harder it is to infiltrate and corrupt by your enemies. Military
systems tend to come as a package - if you want new guidance software
on your air-to-air missles, you send \'em all back to the factory.
Chances are they\'ll need new hardware for the new software to use anyways.

That Ariane rocket that crashed did so because of a single routine that
overflowed a floating point value. In essence, one, small subroutine
returned "10" instead of "5". You do not want to make serious, 
mission-critical software easy to change. You want to make it damn hard.

See:

If I can swap the ROMs in my laser turret to make it work any better 
than it did before, I\'m going to take it back for a refund because
I got ripped off in the first place. Embedded software is usually
as close to optimal as possible for a given piece of hardware when 
said hardware/software combo ships. Given the pace of change in the 
Imperium and the long distribution lags, I doubt that time-to-market
is a big R&D factor like it is nowadays.

Also, the idea that someone with Gunenry-3 and Computer-3 can sit
down and write Gunnery-3 software in anything less than a decade
is silly. If someone writes new computer rules for T4, don\'t copy
the CT rules. They\'re right up there with "crazy loner scientist
creates intelligent humanoid robot while multi-trillion dollar 
R&D company has trouble working toaster" stories. Unless that\'s
what you\'re going for, of course.

I think that when you take into account the amount of state info
something like a pentium contains, even if you test a trillion
inputs a second, you\'d still be testing your pentium until
the end of time... if you could come up with a useful, stateless
processor, you might be able to "prove" it, but with something
like a Pentium, you not only have to test each set of inputs,
you have to test each _sequence_ of sets of inputs. Yuck!

I doubt computers in the 3I will be any better.

As a reference, from this month\'s \'IEEE Computer\', in the article
\'Billion-Transistor Architectures\', the following factiod is given:

  Validation and testing now account for 40 to 50 percent of
  an Intel chip\'s design cost, and 6 percent of the transistors
  (for built in self-test) on the Pentium Pro.

I\'d wager that for any large, really critical software system
the costs will be quite similar. And after you spend 50% of
your development effort on testing, the last thing you\'re going
to do is let other people play around with it.

Ethan, who has no idea why he\'s so whipped up about this.

I believe you are speaking of _Return of Space Viking_.

This was a project of Jerry Pournelle\'s (close friend of Piper), but to date
remains unfinished/unpublished. He was supposedly working from notes of
remembered conversations with Piper regarding the intended direction of
events subsequent to those set forth in _Space Viking_.

You are missing the point.  WHEN such material becomes available to me,

Doesn\'t need to be.  THere are NOT laws that prohibit this behavior.

This is the reason that I am currently running a very irregular game
(non-Traveller, actually we were running Battle.... uh anyway). Then just
when the T4 rules came out and I was setting up to shift to Trav. both my
sons (two of four players) decided to enlist. PROUD to say both are LCPL
right now and Uncle Sam won\'t let \'em come home to play games with their
Dad. By the way their Mom plays too,and my daughter (16) wants to when ever
it doesn\'t interfere with her social life (almost always).

Well, if things are as bad as they are now in the 3I it doesn\'t exist...I
suspect that electronics and computer engineering will mature, and be able
to make designs that are far less error prone than the systems we have
now. By figuring out ways of doing the very testing you\'re talking about.
 
Look at the history of other engineering advances...after all we
_can_ routinely build bridges that don\'t fall down regularly, which wasn\'t
the case when engineering as a science was evolving in the 18th and 19th
centuries. There\'s columnist in American Scientist who writes regularly on
the subject of engineering, named (IIRC) Henry Petrowski. His columns are
always pretty fascinating reading.

I\'m not completely sure about this, but if I recall correctly, from my
business law class, photo-copying something like this is not illegal.

It\'s illegal if you photo-copy it and then sell it.

If I\'m wrong about this, I\'m sure some brave soul on the list will stomp

	It might help if you think about it like this: the present value 
of x Cr in the future is the amount of money you would have to put into 
the bank _now_ to have that much money at the given point in the future.  
If a ship is worth 25% of its origninal value after 40 years of use, and 
the owner gets title to the ship after 40 years, then the PV of a 40 
year-old ship 40 years from now is the amount of money he\'d need to put 
in a comparably risky investment to thave that much money in the future.
	For a 100MCr ship, the PV of that ship 40 years in the future is 
2.91MCr (assuming 5.52% rate, a 6% rate gives 2.43MCr).  That works out 
to 11.67% of 25MCr.  You can use that percentage to figure out the PV of 
other investments that pay off after 40 years with the same interest 
rate.  To calculate it yourself, use the PV function on your 
spreadsheet.  So if your just wanted to _lease_ the ship for 40 years, 
you could knock 11.67% off the down-payment.  Of course, leases come with 
all those rules that players would object to, but some companies might 
find it advantageous to lease spacecraft, particularly in-system shuttles 
and the like that you might want for shorter periods of time or that form 
"non-core" parts of your business.

	Slightly, but I don\'t have the patience necessary to fill in 480
cells with small monthly payments and then convert the resulting figure
from monthly to the equivalent annual rate right now.  It will increase
the return slightly to (guesstimate) 5.6% or 5.7% annual yield. The
particular number isn\'t very important, since it is totaly arbitrary, only
that we take one number and apply it to both bank and shipowner.  More
complicated models would give different rates to the two of them, but for
that we\'d have to know a whole bunch of things about the Imperial economy
that we don\'t know. 
	For the purposes of monthly accounting, the ship-owner should get
the same payment schedule as the bank -- 1/240th of 1.25 times his
investment per month for 480 months. I\'ll let you figure out how much 
that increases the cost of freight and passenger transport :-)

LOVE Piper. Giant Spherical ships with contragrav, missles, slug throwers
for small arms, contragravity airliners (that I always pictured as the
Zepplin taken to the exterme). When Trav first came out, and before GDW
started to flesh out the Imperium, H. Beam Piper was the author I based my
early games on. Nothing slicker than dropping the PC\'s into the "politics"
of "Four Day Planet", especially with a "Whale hunt" thrown in for good
measure!

Hmmm... Where did I store that book? Boy are they gonna love this...

There might or might not be much ritual to it.

A female friend of mine (married to a male friend of mine) was crew chief at
an archeoligical excavation in Turkey about 20 years ago. There was some
trouble with the local Turkish laborers taking orders from a woman, until the
Turks decided that wearing jeans and a work shirt made her an honorary man,
and that solved the problem.

	There are ongoing studies into high gravity chemistry and metallurgy
at institutions that house high-g centrifuges.  I remember having read about
how crystal symetries change when grown in differing g levels.  The high end
systems can generate up to (no this is not a joke, and I\'ll see if I can
find a reference) 50,000g\'s.  I don\'t know much about the experimental
results however.

Where?

Granted, I don\'t have the original Box Of Three, but I do have a bunch of 
CT supplements, I see no English measurements anywhere (thankfully).

Scouts has got good ol\' Celsius and Kilometres, High Guard has its cubic 
metres and Mercenary has got weapon and ammo weights in grams.

I don\'t remember ever seeing "English" measurements with respect to 
Traveller except for the planetary generation charts, where world sizes 
were listed in both miles and kilometers.

The Metric system is a scientific system. For a Science Fiction game why 
would I expect to see an Archaic, non-rational, and hard to use system of 
weights and measures?

"Famille Spofulam Yards announces Type S upgrade program

	The Type S Scout/Courier is an common sight on the Imperial space
lanes and beyond.  Its diminutive wedge-shaped hull symbolizes the
ubiquitous IISS.  As an inexpensive vessel that is jack of all trades and
master of none, it is alone in its class.  There will doubtlessly be Type
S\'s still serving the Imperium millenia from now.  However, while many are
available as IISS surplus, or are loaned to retired Scout personnel, the
stock Type S has been criticized on several levels; moderate performance
and range, a sensor suite that is far beyond most normal commercial needs,
and a rather inefficient use of internal space.  As a scout, it is of
moderate usefulness due to its small size; recent IISS procurements have
been aimed at larger, more capable vessels.  As a commercial vessel, its
low cargo capacity is a major failing, and as a courier, it is outperformed
by several high-performance vessels such as FSY\'s Moufette-Rapide class Far
Courier.

	However, this is about to change; Famille Spofulam, expanding into
another unusual niche market, has announced an upgrade program that will
convert a stock, surplus Type S into a significantly faster and
longer-ranged vessel, with increased cargo capacity to boot.  For a bill of
42 Mcr (which may vary depending on the condition of the Type S being
modified and its components) Famille Spofulam Yards will gut the ship,
reinforce its structural members, re-arrange its internal layout, and
install a 4G maneuver drive, a 3-parsec jump drive, and a modified fuel
purification system.  The result, while having more cramped living quarters
and lesser sensor range than before, also has 18 tons more cargo space.

	The first vessel to undergo the upgrade was rolled out before the
media last Fourday at a FSY press conference at their Sylean groundside
facility.  After the press had been softened up by the usual lavish buffet
and wet bar, they were ushered to viewing stands before a large hangar.
The PA system began playing Famille Spofulam\'s corporate anthem, that
lovely piece of 20th-century Terran industrial religious music "Jesus Built
My Hot Rod", composed by the Master, Al Jurgenson, and the hangar doors
slid open to reveal... a fairly standard-looking Type S.

	The industry press, having expected something a little bit less
prosaic-looking from a Famille Spofulam product launch, were initially
underwhelmed by the absence of ludicrously oversized spinally mounted
particle accelerator guns or large pink and chrome fins.  Even the rather
splashy black colour scheme, accentuated by stylized red and orange flames
running down the side and chromed trim, did little to arouse their
enthusiasm.

	However, as the interior tours quickly revealed, the changes made
were significant.  For one, the horribly spacewasting central cargo
compartment, with corridors running down either side, is gone.  The small
bridge of the Type S has been replaced by a two-workstation cockpit right
forwards opening onto the 3-ton lounge, which in turn is surrounded by four
small staterooms.  A rather narrow corridor leads aft to the single airlock
and the engineering spaces, which are likewise somewhat cramped; not a
cubic meter has gone to waste.  The cargo bay is emplaced asymetrically to
port, served by a single large cargo hatch on the underside of the ship.
Avionics, sensors, and commo gear, rather than being located in a single
bay, are split up into the smallest possible individual components in
various locations in the previously wasted space around the angles of the
hull.  While rendering trouble-shooting and service somewhat more
difficult, FSY emphasized that this was neccesary in order to maximize
interior space.

	The verdict?  While the cost of a refit is easily twice the price
of a new Type S, a Spofulam conversion may very well be worth the money.
The 100% increase in acceleration and extra parsec jump range are
significant for a courier vessel, and the 2-1/2 times increase in cargo
space makes for a giant improvement in the vessel\'s commerical viability.
For a startup courier operation, a Spofulam-converted Type S may be hard to
beat.

	When contacted for comments, Rozehkollis Aagaporniz, head of Ling
Standard\'s shipbuilding division and a longtime Spofulam detractor, had the
following to say: "what I want to know is what they\'re doing with the
maneuver and jump drives they\'re ripping out of those Type S\'s!  God only
knows who or what those demented ratbast..., er, since the lawsuit my
lawyers have advised me to describe them only as \'valued colleagues\', are
selling them to.  I\'m sure your average Vargr pirate would pay dearly to
get ahold of a Scout-surplus sensor system, let alone the drives!"

	When contacted with precisely this question, an FSY spokesperson
responded: "At Famille Spofulam, the protection of the environment and
careful use of valuable resources has always been a major concern; we
simply recycle the used components!"..."

various hull dimensions.

HULL FORMS
Hulls are available in five standard forms: Sphere, Cylinder, Slab, Wedge,
Cone, and Open Frame.
Ratios of length to width (or others) are specified in these descriptions;
they may be varied in other designs.
Sphere. The hull is ball shaped (variations may be ellipsoidal).

Volume = 	(pi * diameter ^3) /6
Area = 	pi * diameter ^2

Diameter =	(6 * volume / pi ) ^ (1/3))

Cylinder. The hull is cylindrical. The ends may be flat, or they may be
hemispherical.

Volume = 	pi * length * radius ^2
Area =	(2 * pi * radius ^2) +
	pi * diameter * length
Length =	volume / (pi * radius * 2)

The standard value for diameter is the radius of a sphere of equal volume.

Diameter =	(6* volume / pi ) ^ (1/3))/2

Slab. The hull is a rectangular prism. The ends may be flat, rounded or
pointed.

Volume = 	width * length * height
Area = 	2 * ((length * width) + 
	(length * height) +
	(width * height))

The standard value for height is the radius of a sphere of equal volume; the
standard value of width is 1.5 times height.

Height =	((volume /4.17) ^(1/3))
Width = 	height * 1.5
Length =	volume / (height * width)

Wedge. The hull is a rectangular prism; essentially a slab sliced in half
diagonally.

Volume = 	width * length * height /2
Area = 	(width * height) +
	(length * height) +
	2 * (width * length)

The standard value for height is the radius of a sphere of equal volume; the
standard value of width is 1.5 times height.

Height =	((volume /4.17) ^(1/3))
Width = 	height * 1.5
Length =	2* volume /(height *width)

 Cone. The hull is a partial cylinder with a cone bow.

Volume = 	(pi * radius * length) /3
Area = 	(pi * radius ^2) +
	(pi * diameter) * length /2

The standard value for diameter is the diameter of a sphere of equal volume.

Diameter =	(6 * volume / pi ) ^ (1/3))
Length =	volume / 
	(pi * radius ^2) /3

Open Frame. The components of the ship are assembled on a frame with open
areas interspersed. The general shape is of a cylinder.

Volume = 	(pi * length * radius ^2)
	/ 1.5
Area =	(2 * pi * radius ^2) +
	pi * diameter * length
Length =	volume / (pi * radius * 2)

The standard value for diameter is the radius of a sphere of 1.5 times
volume. The total encompassed volume (but not usable volume) of the open
frame is 1.5 times the volume of a cylinder with equal tonnage.

Diameter =	1.5 *

What kinds of items are included in a medical kit?  How do you know 
when the supplies in a medical kit are used up?

These are the types of questions that I have recently answered for my 
game.  This has lead to another "Ken\'s Tweaks" post, in which I 
answer those questions.  You may want to use these rules, or some 
variant there of, in your game too.

I am using extended medical rules.  You can find the ones that I am 
using in issues 12 and 13 of the Traveller\'s Digest.  These were 
originally designed for MT, but with slight modification, they fit T4 
like a glove.  If you have these rules and are interested in the 
couple of changes I made (Ken\'s Tweaks) to get them compatible with 
T4, e-mail me in private.

For those of you who do not have those two excellent issues of the 
Traveller\'s Digest, there is a similar article in the Best of the 
Journal of the Traveller\'s Aide Society #3.  I don\'t think this 
article is near as good as the one in the TD issues, but it will 
suffice.  In fact, it looks like the article in TD12-13 was based on 
the ground work laid in that JTAS article.

Even if you don\'t have either of these extended medical rules for 
Traveller,  my medical supply tweak listed below can still add more 
detail to your game with the exisiting basic rules in T4.  You can 
even use these rules to backward navigate items like the TL 11 KIA, 
listed on page 7 of the CSC, to see what the cost of the item would 
be new.

And now, on to my tweaks...

Kenneth.

post--called "Ken\'s Tweaks:  Drugs".
==============================================================

Medical Supply Rules			.

DETAILING A MEDICAL KIT
Each medical practitioner--whether he be a doctor, paramedic, or
nurse--has his own view of the optimal supply arrangement in medical
kits.  To determine what exact supplies are included in a medical kit,
use the price of the medical kit as a starting point and follow the
example below to detail every item.  The GM can detail a kit for its
first purchase by the character (because the kits will come supplied
in a standard way), but the character is allowed to restock his kit
anyway he sees fit.

For the example, let\'s detail the contents of the medkit listed on
page 73 of T4 Book 1.  In the kit\'s description, it states that the
kit includes a diagnostic computer, stimulants, sedatives,
antibiotics, metabolic enhancers, and metabolic reducers.  It is also
assumed that the kit includes miscellaneous supplies like surgical
tape, liquid sterilizer, scissors, medical utensils, syringes, and the
like.  

The kit\'s price is Cr1,000, but retailers usually price packages
cheaper than what it costs to buy all items contained in the package
individually.  Given this, the total price of all items contained in
the kit cannot exceed twice the price of the kit.  Also, the kit
itself will cost something, and a standard price for the actual kit is
10% of the retail price of the kit including supplies.

Figuring kit contents:  First, we need calculate how much we can spend
on supplies.  The kit\'s retail price is Cr1,000.  Given this, we can
supply the kit up to a total of Cr2,000.  

Now that we know our spending limit, we need a case to put the
supplies in.  Using the 10% rule, this case costs Cr100.  That leaves
us Cr1,900 to pack the kit with supplies.

Looking at the description, we see that kit contains a diagnostic
computer.  We\'ll use the TL 11 Med Microscanner listed on page 26 of
the CSC.  That costs Cr500, so we are left with Cr1,400 for the rest
of the equipment in the case.

We will need miscellaneous medical supplies.  This includes medical
tape, liquid sterilizer, syringes and other medical utensils, and
other miscellaneous items.  Standard in a medical kit of this size is
Cr200-300 worth of miscellaneous medical supplies.  We\'ll go with
Cr200, leaving us Cr1,200 for the rest of the kit.

The miscellaneous medical supplies account for gauze and typical
bandages.  A more high-tech version is also available in the form of
Bandage, listed on page 8 of the CSC.  We\'ll include five spray tubes
of Bandage in our kit.  At a cost of Cr20 each, this leaves Cr1,100 in
the kitty.

This brings us to the drugs contained in the kit.  Medical Drug,
listed on page 70 of Book 1, is a general medical drug used for a
number of applications.  This drug can be used to account for the
kit\'s stimulants, sedatives, and antibiotics.  The kit also includes a
metabolic enhancer and a metabolic reducer.  For these, we choose the
medical version of Slow Drug and a dose or so of Fast Drug.

Medical Drug costs Cr100 per dose.  Medical Slow Drug is Cr500 per
dose, and  Fast Drug is Cr200 per dose.  We have Cr1,100 left to
spend, and we can equip the kit with any combination of these drugs as
long as the total for each does not go over our allotted Cr1,100.

We\'ll include 4 doses of Medical Drug, and this will leave us with
Cr700.  Next, we\'ll add one dose of Medical Slow.  With the last
Cr200, we\'ll include a dose of Fast Drug.

And that uses up all of our allotted medical supply spending.  We now
have a complete medical kit that contains:

- ----
TL 8 Medkit  Wt.  8kg (listed on page 73 of T4 Book 1)

Case
4 doses of Medical Drug
1 dose of Medical Slow Drug
1 dose of Fast Drug
5 spray tubes of Bandage
Cr200 in miscellaneous medical supplies
- ----

The GM should take care that TL restrictions are not broken.  In this
kit, we have included a number of items from various tech levels.  The
kit, overall, is TL 8, but we\'ve included a TL 11 microscanner and TL
9 Fast Drug.  This was done in this example because the description of
the medkit called for those items.  Normally, it is suggested that
higher-tech medical items not be included in a lower-tech medical kit.
 A higher-tech kit can be purchased, or the higher-tech items can be
purchased independently and added to the kit.  The GM will have to
make a ruling on this based on the dynamics of his game.

Also, there are a number of drugs listed in the medical drug list.  If
you have access to the Traveller materials where these items are
listed, you can detail your medical kit in various ways.  For
instance, you can detail specific antibiotics instead of using the
multi-purpose medical drug.

The rules below will explain how to use the supplies contained in the
kit.



USING MEDICAL SUPPLIES
Supplies will be used up every time the kit is used.  Miscellaneous
items like surgical tape and liquid sterilizer will be used. 
Disposable syringes will be thrown away.  Some items, like scissors,
can be broken and need replacement.  Things like drugs will also be
used, based on how bad off the injured patient is.

Drugs are used as described in the description for each drug, but
there are three items that every medical kit should
have--miscellaneous medical supplies, medical drug, and bandage spray.
 These items are used up in the following manner.

Miscellaneous Supplies:  Superficial wounds require the usage of Cr3D6
miscellaneous medical supplies.  Minor and worse wounds require the
usage of Cr2D6 x 10 supplies. 

GM\'s may put modifiers on these throws based on the damage to the
character.  Use a hit location chart to help decide if a modifier is
needed to increase or decrease the amount of miscellaneous supplies
used. 

At first, it seems that serious wounds would require more supplies
than minor ones, but upon further examination, it is revealed that
this is not the case.  There is only so much that can be done from the
outside, without surgery.  All that can be done with a medkit for a
bullet hole (probably a serious wound), for instance, might be the
placing of gauze on the outside of the wound to stop the
bleeding--which might be the same field treatment for a deep scratch
(probably a minor wound).

Medical Drug:  Medical Drug, also called panacea, is actually a set of
medications used for a variety of illnesses and injuries.  All medical
kits in the Traveller universe should contain Medical Drug, if only
for the drug\'s broad scope.

One dose of Medical Drug is required for the treatment of superficial
wounds.  Two doses are required for the treatment of minor wounds. 
Three doses are required for serious wounds, and four doses are
required, if a dead person is to be saved (under the rules on page 58
of Book 1). 

Bandage:  Miscellaneous medical supplies include normal bandages,
gauze, and other wound coverings.  Bandage is described on page 8 of
the CSC, and one spray tube is used for each wound covered by the
bandage.  The GM may alter this if the wound is very large--requiring
two or more bandage spray tubes to cover the wound.

	On the other hand side, I have lived in a commune called

	Anarcho Syndicalism is much more effective in the chaos called
	economie, because decissions are spontanous made by the people
	who are doing "the real work" (TM). Compare the effecivity of
	the Linux development with that of M$, with that of a plan team
	like ANSI.

	On the other hand side you have the long vilani tradition in
	slow progress and long plans for interstellar economie. So
	while planet governments are most times like US or Europe
	trying to increase their tech level as fast as posible, the
	3I burocrathy is more like china "allways on the save side,
	planing the water,the roads and bridges for the next generation".
	China was invaded several times (the last invasion was MaoTseTung)
	but non of those invaders was able to change the burocrathy.
	And the burocrathy prefers to have a stable emperor, so that they

I spoke with Mr. Pournelle about that sequel a few months ago, (I think it was
June), and he stated it was still a project but had been shelved for right now.
The man has about a thousand projects all going on.  :)  It may be some years
before we see a sequel, if indeed we ever do.

I agree with most of your points - but I think your 600 ly figure refers
only to the "Thin Disc", which is just the middle layer of the Galaxy (the
cream in the Oreo, as it were). Here are some stats I lifted from Henbest &
Couper\'s wunnerful book, _A Guide to the Galaxy_:

- ----
Galactic Disc: ~100,000 light years across. In cross-section, can be
divided into three nested regions:
   Thick Disc: Intermediate-age stars between Pop\'n I & II: ~4000 ly thick.
   Main Disc: contains most of the stars. ~2000 ly thick.
   Thin Disc: central plane, ~500 ly thick, contains Sol & most of the gas
& dust.

Sun is ~6.1 kiloparsecs (20,000 ly) from Galactic centre.
   Suns\'s orbit about Galactic centre: ~240 million years.
   Sun\'s \'apogalacticon\' (farthest point): 107% of current distance.
   Sun\'s \'perigalacticon\' (nearest point): 99.5% of current distance; the
Sun will reach this point in ~15 million years.

Sun is now ~50 ly (15.34 pc) above Galactic midplane.
   Maximum height: 250 ly above, in ~14 million years.
   Maximum depth: 250 ly below.
   Crosses midplane every 33 million years.
- ----

You\'re right that the game maps are flat only because it\'s convenient -
just as it\'s more convenient to constrain the stars to a hex grid.

However, early last year Glenn Hoppe came up with a nicely elegant (if
non-canonical) explanation for the flatness of the Traveller starmaps,
suggesting that JumpSpace effectively collapses the Galaxy\'s third
dimension. I liked this concept a lot, and elaborated on it extensively. I
decided that the Galaxy has many JumpSpace Planes, layered one above the
other, separated by thinner SlowSpace Planes, where jump travel is
impossible.

A really nice spinoff of all this furious handwaving is that you can have a
somewhat 3D campaign, while retaining the convenience of 2D maps. Each
Plane is a discrete flat map; but certain massive stars (4+ Solar masses)
warp Planes to create "Jump Bridges" connecting the planes. Galactic
politics and history in this game universe often revolve around control of
these Jump Bridges, and the multiple levels provide a sense of realistic
three-dimensionality without all the hassle of a 3D coordinate system (a la
2300). On average, there\'s about one bridge star for every two subsectors,
maybe more.

Obviously these ideas all useless if you are running a campaign set in the
canonical Imperium universe. Fortunately, my campaign is almost entirely
non-canonical, set in a future history of my own. For anyone who might be
interested, here\'s a Library entry on JumpSpace Planes, just recently
written up:

jumpspace - A hyperspatial region on the border of Hilbert Space where the
known laws of physics do not apply, and faster than light travel is
possible. Theorists cannot agree whether jumpspace actually exists as an
actual continuum, or if it is only a phenomenon generated by jumpdrives.
     Jumpspace is not accessible everywhere. Gravity chaotically distorts
the geometry of jumpspace; thus jumpdrives cannot be safely engaged within
about 100 diameters of a star, planet, or other large mass. As a corollary,
however, jumpspace is also made possible by very large, rapidly rotating
masses, such as the ultra-massive black hole at the Galactic Core. The Core
singularity generates a multi-layered complex of regions, known as
jumpspace planes, where jumpspace is accessible, surrounded by regions of
slowspace, where jump travel is not possible. Each plane radiates outward
from the Core.
     Only the central Galactic Midplane is actually flat; the planes above
and below it follow the surfaces of shallow paraboloids. In the Orion Arm,
each plane is about ten parsecs deep. The planes thicken toward the Core,
thus overlapping to create one very deep jump region, providing access to
all planes. Towards the Rim, the planes become thinner, eventually
disappearing; they also gradually radiate farther away from each other. The
regions between each plane are slowspace, inaccessible to any known jump
drive. Fortunately, in the Orion Arm the jump planes are close together,
separated only by about 1pc of slowspace.
     Extremely massive stars (generally O, B, and some A type stars) warp
jumpspace enough to create a slight thickening of the plane - just enough
to cause it to overlap with an adjacent plane. Such jump bridges are of
prime strategic importance; they are the only conduits in the Orion Arm for
FTL travel between jump planes. The bridge stars nearest to Sol are
Fomalhaut, which links the +1 Plane to the Galactic Midplane, and Arcturus,
which bridges the +1 and +2 Planes.
     For the purposes of FTL travel, jumpspace is effectively flat: within
each plane, the three dimensions of n-space are collapsed into two. Thus
two stars which appear only one parsec from each other on a map of
jumpspace may acttually lie ten parsecs apart in n-space.
     FTL civilizations to Rimward, in the Perseus Arm, are confined to thin
jumpspace planes, sparsely populated with few accessible stars. Mature
galactic civilizations, on the other hand, inevitably migrate Coreward to
the Sagittarius Arm, where the planes overlap and become a single jumpspace
region, over 1000 pc deep.

more or less to the equivalent rank on Earth today, which is why I feel

Imperial services worked out, but since I posted them a few months ago 
in connection with my general economics rules, I won\'t repost them all

That is especially true if the product itself is not currently available (ie

When someone starts photocopying multtiple copies for others, then it gets to

I wrote this a while ago. I was going to try and work something in on
insurance as well, but haven\'t had a chance to get around to it yet. Any
suggestions appreciated:

Cargo Bonds (M0).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The corporate executive looked at the grizzled old trader from the battered
ship sitting before him at the table. In the dark of the starport tavern
booth the bearded starship captain looked more than a little disreputable,
almost piratical. The executive shuddered. What if the precious cargo of
electronic components from the new manufacturing plant were to be \'lost\'?
It\'d bring the company down, with all the investment tied up in the R&D
prototypes. Without them there was no business, no deal with Naasirka, and
no enormous personal profits from selling the company. But the price was
right, and more importantly, it was the only ship that had cargo space
available and was willing to travel to the destination...

She shook hands with the ships\' captain and then, looking him straight in
the eye, said, "I think we agree on price and timescale, Captain. Now about
the cargo bond..."

- ----

Cargo Bonds.
===========

Zhunastu Industries development of Fusion+ and the deployment of fighter
craft has vastly reduced the incidence of piracy within the borders of the
Third Imperium. The Imperial Navy is now capable of rapidly and effectively
neutralising pirate activity once it is reported.

However, before these developments pirate activity wreaked havoc throughout
the Sylean Federation. Insurance companies refused to cover losses to
shipping and cargo, throwing into doubt the the future of interstellar
trade. Naturally, the Federation government was extremely concerned at the
potential damage to the economy, and acted in two ways. The Navy was
ordered to increase patrol levels, and legislation was instigated to ensure
that merchants could obtain insurance cover.

Surprisingly, the first attempt to legislate was blocked by vested
interests within the Federation from within the merchant classes
themselves. Many of them had significant investments in the insurance and
finance industries, and the proposed compulsary insurance schemes made them
distinctly nervous. The lack of confidence that this demonstrated in the
Navy\'s ability to persecute a campaign against the pirates  demonstrated
the true magnitude of the problem facing the Sylean Federation.

A second piece of legislation was passed extremely rapidly, giving cargo
owners the rights to demand a security bond in case of loss of cargo, or
even late delivery. The bond would be held in trust by the Port Warden at
the loading port, and only released once confirmation of cargo delivery was
received. This legislation performed two things - it transfered the risk of
cargo shipment to the shipowner, and made company\'s more confident at
engaging in interstellar trade.

With no scale of acceptable fees, several companies sought to manipulate
the market by setting exhorbitant bonds, forcing competitors out of
business or passing trade to prefered ship owners. After a few months, an
unofficial code was adopted by many of the ship owners on Sylea who refused
to be held to ransom by the corporations.  This code spread throughout the
Federation, and was generally adopted within a few years, being in the
interest of the ship owners. Those that did not accept the code were
treated as pariahs by their peers, and soon either ceased trading or were
absorbed by the corporations.

Today, with the increased security of the Imperial Core, the need for the
bond is increasingly being questioned by the traders and merchants. Several
of the larger financial corporations have expressed interest in re-entering
the cargo insurance market, and it is unknown how long the bond will be
commonplace in the Imperium. Indeed, sources close to the Iridium Throne
have indicated that the Cargo Bond will be one of the areas of previous
Federation law covered in the current review. However, the Cargo Bond is
still applicable to the frontier regions, and in some cases the shipowner\'s
code is being challenged by corporations eager to ensure that they receive
an adequate return on any lost shipping.

====

Cargo bonds (rules):

The Shipowner\'s Code limits the maximum bond to 100% of the cargo value.
Usually values of around 10 to 20% are used in the Core regions. In
frontier regions, cargo owners may demand higher surieties. Whether they
are accepted by the shipping captain is another matter!

Initially, the bond was a cash or other guaranteed sum placed with the Port
Warden at the port of departure. The bond would not be released until
confirmation of shipment was recieved, although it could be transfered to
another cargo. In M0, the bond is often backed by Megacorporate surieties,
and it is likely that this is the market out from which the shipping
insurance will redevelop. However, shipowners will still have to find the
initial bond value, or agree a staggered payment scheme. Skipping a
staggered payment scheme could lead to severe legal repurcussions if the
cargo owner finds out.

Plotlines:

The players have to supply a large bond to cover an expensive (but
lucrative) cargo. How do they get the money?

The players are accused of failing to deliver a cargo, and a claim is made
against their bond...

Notes:

These laws become obselete as the Imperium matures!

Who builds the Starports? 
Good question. Here\'s one answer.

The Imperium of M0 is expanding fast. The cost of building class C ports is
astronomical (pun not intended; probably not even present). So the Imperium
grants licenses like the one given to SDC in my own campaign (Sylean
Development Corporation)

The deal is this: SDC buys the rights to open up Darvli Ga, which is a TL3
world in Lishun Sector, about 20 years\' worth of expansion out from the
Imperial border. 

SDC handles the contact, trade etc - the locals have a marked field, so
they\'ve at least had visitors before.

SDC sends a \'seeder colony\' of perhaps a thousand colonists with some F+
and equipment to set up a little community - but not to take over, no sir. 

The colonists will set up a minor port (D class), and gradually integrate
with local society - showing the benefits of high-tech living etc to the
locals. This is done subtly, over a period of 20 years. Gradually starships
begin to use the port, trading with the locals through the colonists and
their local allies - who gain an significant economic advantage. The port
is slowly upgraded, the locals subtly manipulated to like the idea of being
part of an interstellar \'family\' - this only works with basically peaceable
locals who are reasonably receptive - other approaches are used in other
circumstances)

By the time the Imperial border \'catches up\', the world of Darvli Ga is in
a state of rapidly progressing technology (OK, TL4  still, but improving),
has a society eager to integrate and gain more of the benefits of this
higher tech, with a Class C port defended by Corporation mercenaries and
local sepoys. 

The Imperium gains a new world (which isn\'t very valuable yet but is on the
way to becoming so), and a decent starport. SDC gets the chance to make
money from operating the Starport (it\'s still Imperial territory and the
Imperium will take a percentage), plus revenue from the planetary
industries, which by not they just about own.

I.e.: Private concerns, noble families - anyone with money and a good
record - can build a Starport. They\'ll have to pay out to the Imperium, but
what a source of revenue! The Imperium still retains certain controls, and
will build ports at its own expense too. But this seems to be one way of
lowering the cost....

What\'s anybody think?

features, including:

	* Low-bandwidth orbital telecommunications 

	* Weather observation

	* World surface survey

	* Orbital object identification and tracking (OIT)

	* User Interface

Let\'s take a glance at each of these features.

The SurSat has an orbital-range communications module, capable
of handling multiple simultaneous channels.  The actual number
of channels is equal to your SurSat\'s _CommSat module number_.

The SurSat has temperature and other atmospheric logic modules
for determining local and global weather patterns.

The SurSat has variable granularity telescopic lenses, capable
of surveying a world in as fine a detail as you like.  If you
place your SurSat at an optimal orbital range (varies with 
planetary characteristics), the Type XK.1a Survey Module will perform 
according to the following table (error rate <= 0.01):

Type XK.1a Survey Module Time Performance (approx)

(NOTE: multiply world survey times by World Size)

The SurSat has an AI module which can identify, examine, and track
predefined objects in orbit and relay telemetry data back to your ship.
The number and complexity of such objects which your SurSat can 
handle depends on your SurSat\'s _OIT module number_.

Finally, the SurSat has a command interface for direct control
via your ship\'s computer.

Actually, acetylene dissolved in acetone. And yeah, it\'s a short but

It\'s also a *classic* example of how to pull off a scam, even though it
failed. File off the serial numbers and use it on your players. :-)

Sort of. Jerry Pournelle knew Piper when Piper was still alive, and got
permission to set stories in Piper\'s universe. He\'s been working on
"Return of Space Viking" (working title) for years. When it\'ll come out
is anyone\'s guess.

"Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen").

Do realize that the HELL system uses the lasers to vaporize reaction
mass. This takes a lot less energy than using pure photon pressure.

The momentum of a photon depends on the wavelength. You need to use
planck\'s constant. I think the formula is p=h/v (p=momentum,
v=wavelength, h=planck\'s constant). So that tells you how many photons
you need. The energy of a photon is given by a similar formula.

But the problem is that the energy in a beam of photons that\'ll give
one ton of thrust is enough to carve up asteroids with. It\'s a bit
impractical. 

> Also one other quick question: can increase Surface Area for the

The thrust is dependent on the *number* of photons. So it\'ll take the
same *energy* either way. And making it narrower is going to increase
the energy density (which is already astronomical!).

Back in the 20s or 30s, this guy approached the Navy Department with
this "fuel additive" that\'d let engines run on water. He wanted a lot
of money. So they demanded a demonstration. He came to the test with a
small container of the additive. He was given a bucket of water, and
added the additive to it. Then he poured it into the tank of the engine
on the test stand. The engine ran. The bureacrats were impressed. But
he wanted a *lot* of money. 

He had to given another demo before higher ranking officials. Same
routine, same results.

They *finally* call in a technical expert. He listens to what they say
about the inventor, then tells them what the guy is using. He also
suggests that they have the engine used in the test torn down and
examined. They do so and it\'s pretty messed up. 

The inventor shows up, and the techinal expert confronts him. Exit
inventor, hopes dashed.

What was the "additive"? Acetone with acetylene dissolved in it.
Acetone will hold an *enormous* amount of acetylene, especially under a
bit of pressure. Even mixed with water, it\'ll burn. But it burns *hot*.
And between the heat and the water, it\'ll quickly *ruin* an engine. The
inventor knew it wasn\'t workable, but he was trying to get them to pay
money before they figured it out. :-)

Well, the highport in a "high" (synchronous?) orbit has advantages of
its own. Travel times from the surface are shorter, and you\'d want some
stuff there as part of the comm network.

Depending on the model of jump you use, there may or may not be good
reasons for jumping from different places 100 dia. out. The way I see
it, you keep your velocity (relative to *anything*) when you jump. So
the best place to jump from depends on the relative velocity of the
system you are jumping to. And incoming ships might have a fair bit of
velocity to get rid of after jump.

- ----

I was driving back towards work after lunch, and thought about
July\'s Traveller meeting.  There were only four of us,
so I decided to just do some ship combat for fun.  It took
forever, because none of us remembered how we did it last
Spring and we hadn\'t touched ship combat in the sessions
between.

What did us in was the sensor lock + to-hit determinations.
Too much stuff, and with seemingly random significance.  I
fondly remembered Classic Traveller, which didn\'t worry about
things like sensors.  But then I realized that sensor skill
and sensor packages SHOULD make a difference.  Then I started
wondering how I would design ship combat... (wavy fuzzy lines
denoting "mind\'s eye" perspective):


Dice to Roll == Range Band (VC=1, C, M, L, VL=5)
Target #     == Ship size class

And of course, an exceptional success (all 1\'s) is a success, no 
matter how low the target # is... and an exceptional failure 
(all 6\'s) is still a failure, no matter how high the target #...


SENSOR LOCK:
- ----
+ sensor skill
+ active sensor rating
- - evader\'s jam sensor rating
- - evader\'s current max G rating


Examples:
- ----
Attacker	Defender	  Range	Dice	Target #
- ----
sensor-2,A2	1000-ton, J8, 6G  M	3	9 + 2 + 2 - 8 - 6 = -1 (2)
sensor-2,A2 	1000t, J8, 6G	  C	2	9 + 2 + 2 - 8 - 6 = -1 (2)
sensor-4,A8	100t, J2, 2G      M	3	8 + 4 + 8 - 2 - 2 = 16-
sensor-4,A8	100t, J2, 2G	  C	2	8 + 4 + 8 - 2 - 2 = 16- (11-)



WEAPONS FIRE:
- ----
+ gunnery skill
+ (anything else?)
- - what?  (I don\'t have the book with me)
  (max G?  Can you outrun a laser?)


Examples:
Attacker	Defender	Range	Dice	Target #
- ----
gunner-2	1000t		M	3	9+2 = 11-
gunner-2	1000t		C	2	      11-
gunner-4	100t		M	3	8+4 = 12- (11-)
gunner-4	100t		C	2	      11-


Implications of this Unamended House Rule:
- ----
Close and Very Close range, without significant negative DM\'s,
are almost guaranteed to work.  Is this realistic?  If not,
then would a simple fix solve the problem, such as adding one
die to roll for each range band?

Are you still the rights holder and officially granting permission?  Or are you just 
offering opinion?

If the first, then great!.  If the second, then you are wrong...it is still a violation of 
copyright until MANY YEARS from now the copyright expires and the work falls into the 
public domain.

Unfortunately, because of who you are, people reading this will take it as sanctioned.

Newspapers would be old and outdated, but would still be the original and if someone COULD 
find a buyer, then that is perfectly legal.

Photocopies are still viable and wanted, but would be copies and if someone found a buyer, 
then that is illegal.

I\'ve written to Marc to clarify whether he is still the rightsholder of the work in 
question and is giving express permission to make the copies.

I have, of course, lost the character sheet.

"Pudding" was a character in a TNE/Regency game.  We were skip tracers, and
it occured to me that having some legal muscle to back up the guns made
sense, so I rolled up a 6-term PC, College, Law School, 3 terms lawyer, one
term as a Secret Agent.  (It seemed to be a pretty good description of who
a skip tracer operated, and I needed some combat skills.)

Physically, Eneri was depressingly average.  His best combat skill was with
his auto-shotgun, with which it was hard to miss :)  However, get him in
the legal arena, and look out.  He had, IIRC, Legal-6, Admin-5, Bribery-3,
Liason-3, and a couple of other bureaucrasy related skills.

Kirsten played my wife (big stretch there), a former pirate who I helped
get out of prison after she was wrongfully sent up.  We had a great time
playing the average married couple in the oddest of situations.. ("Eneri,
remember to arrange to see a dentist when we reach Deneb, oh, and could you
toss me a spare magazine, I\'m running low.."  "Yes, dear.")

Eneri was one of my favorite Traveller characters, simply because he broke
the expect molds.  A slight, balding Vilanni commercial lawyer isn\'t really
what most people think of when they think Traveller character, but he
worked for me.

Then there was the time I sucessfully argued for citizenship for a
Virus-infected Heavy Cruiser in Regency Court....

Actually, the last and final book in the series was just published this
year. It is #32 - "The Return". This last volume is available from Gryphon
Publications and costs US $20. Their address is:

Gryphon Publications
PO Box 209
Brooklyn, N.Y. 11228-0209
USA

They also have for sale their recently published \'lost novel\' by E.C. Tubb
titled "Saturn Patrol". It was his first novel, and was previouly only
published in the early 50\'s in a small print run in the UK. This book costs
US $15 and is well worth it in my opinion. It contains many elements which
were later to be expanded upon in the Dummarest series, and it is most
certainly the inspiration for the Hive Nest/Alien Queen in the "Alien"
movies - read it and you\'ll see what I mean.

They also have two other rare/previously unpublished in english/US novels by
E.C. Tubb which I have not yet read (but plan too). They are: "Pandora\'s
Box" and "The Temple of Death" (the last not to be confused with the
Dummarest novel #31 "The Temple of Truth"). They both cost US $15 each.

Now, you gotta hand it to this guy.  He\'s not just someone who publishes
RPGs.  He\'s a roleplayer himself.

What I would expect on this issue from the creator of the game is,
"Nooooo!  You\'ve got to buy every thing you get, and don\'t
photocopy--even if it is for your own use!"

And, what we got from him on this issue is, "Hey, I like you playing
Traveller.  If you need something that is out of print, and you can get
a photocopy of it, then more power to you.  Just don\'t abuse the
privledge."

Marc doesn\'t sound like the publisher of a game.  He sounds like your
friend--the grand game master that lives down the street, always ready
to put you through another adventure.

Bravo, Marc.

Kenneth.

PS  And, Marc is probably smarter than other game publishers.  Instead
of stomping on you for trying to play the game, he encourages it.  He
figures you\'ll use the old supplements, in photocopy form if you have
to, and play his game.  Then you\'ll have fun with it, and when the new
T4 supplements come out, you\'ll want them more because you are already
playing the game--he dosen\'t have to draw you away from another game.

On top of being friendly, I\'d say Marc is being a good businessman as
well.

There are two  stories (sequals of a sort) to "Great King\'s War" already

"Kalvan Kingmaker", by Rolan Green & John F. Carr (published in

    'body' => 'I\'ve got a few suggestions for IG.


SUGGESTION #1:
The first one has to do with cosmetics.  Notice how all of the books so
far are basically black with red trim.

My suggestions is to change the color of the trim, like they used to do
back in the old CT days, with each milieu.

For instance, each book that has been published so far is designed is
designed for Milieu 0.  Even the main book is directed towards the start
of the Imperium.  And, all of these books have been black with red trim.

Now, when a new milieu comes out--I think M200 is the next--IG should
change the trim color.  Maybe that will be a black book with gold trim,
or blue, or orange, or whatever.

I like this because of two things.  T4 players and GMs can instantly
distinguish between various milieu books as they sit on a shelf, and--I
admit this is a bit nastolgic, but there is nothing wrong with that--it
reminds me of the strip color change between the various little black
books from CT.



SUGGESTION #2:

My second suggestion springs on me as I read through Psionics
Institutes.  At first glance, it seemed to me that the book was to
directed towards M0 that it would not be that usable in my M1100
campaign.

But, as I read through it, I realized that it would not be that hard to
use the book in M1100.  I like the idea of using the book to expand the
psionics rules for my campaign.

In PI, this can be easily done by stating some facts about the M1100
era.  Maybe the world view in the M1100 era is always against psionics,
and you can use the rules in the book for the M1100 era just like you
would a planet that is totally against psionics in the M0 era.

Then, it dawned on me.  It would be nice if there was a section in PI
that detailed how to use the book in different milieus.  I think, in the
case of PI, this can be done relatively easy.  It would take a page, or
less, to add some modifers to the die rolls in PI--maybe a modifier to
skew the die roll for world view to the unfavorable position for M1100.

This would do two things.  It would give users of the book an idea of
where things are going with respect to psionics, and it would make the
book more usable to GMs who are running games in other milieu.  There
are still a lot of gamers out there running games in M1100 and M1200.

My suggestion is to always included, in every supplement to come out of
IG from here on out, a page or so of rules to help you use the material
in different milieu.

I think the EA has already done a good job of this in that it contains
weapons that are above TL 12--and it worked these ideas into the M0
campaign (in the form of high-tech ROM era weapons).  Whether you agree
with the ROM having TL 15 weapons or not, it is nice to have those
weapon selections in the book for M1100 campaigns.

In sum, every IG supplement should be somewhat usable in any era.  Write
the supplement for a particular era, then have a page or so or die
modifiers and text describing how to use the material in different
milieus.



SUGGESTION #3

My last suggestion deals with detailing the Traveller universe.  

To get across this concept, let me tell you how much I liked the area
modules published for D&D\'s Forgotten Realms.  Every so often, TSR will
come out with a new module detailing different parts of the gaming
world.  There\'s a module for Waterdeep.  There\'s a module for the Sword
Coast.  There\'s a module for Thay and surrounding countries.  There\'s a
module for the desert lands.

In short, they\'ve broken up the various geographical regions of the
Forgotten Realms and published a sourcebook for it--detailing all sorts
of neat things about that specific region.  You could spend your whole
gaming life in one of those regions and never get bored.

I have often wanted somthing like this for Traveller.  I\'d like to see
each sector in the Imperium detailed.  Yes, I know.  This will take a
while, but so did the supplements for the Forgotten Realms.  It took
years.

Once a year, once a quarter, or whatever, it would be nice to get a
module detailing a whole sector.  This would include a map of the entire
sector, sections on politics for the region, sections on aliens for the
region, sections on the history of the region, and so forth.  

There should be data on the worlds in that particular sector.  I\'d like
to see notes on how to use this information in different milieus.

Some selected worlds would be fully mapped out.  I can see some cities
on that world mapped, and a micro look taken at the planet.

When these are first published, they can be written for a specific
milieu.  For instance, I can see the nine sectors in M0 being detailed
with an eye towards M0--but notes included for running campaigns in
different eras.

Then, when M200 comes out, the next set of sector supplements would
detail those sectors with a slant towards M200, but, again, a section
would be included for using this info in different campaigns.

Another way to present the sector supplements is to cover certain
subjects, like planets, politics, history,etc, then, within that
section, detail the changes that occurr in the different time periods.

However it is done, it would be nice to see supplements come out like
this.

And, that\'s my three suggestions for supplements today.

Kenneth.

Yep, That\'s were its at. World size numbers are based on Thousands of Miles.Thou,

game of CT several years ago, but the only rulebook my friend had was 
the one on character generation, so we didn\'t get to far.

Now I have the T4 rules, and I have several questions (not about the 
rules so much as the universe\'s assumptions).

The term "jump point" is used often, both in the books and on the 
TML. If I read the books correctly, though, there is no one "point" 
in space that you have to be to jump, you can be anywhere outside of 
the 100 diameter limit, which is a sphere. So what does jump point 
refer to?

Given the above, how does piracy operate? The sensors thread seems to 
indicate that most planets would have sensor capability at least to 
the hundred-diameter limit, and at that point a ship leaving the 
system would jump, leaving the pirates unable to attack the ship in 
privacy. Do they attack the ship in full view of the planet and hope 
to finish the job before help arrives?? Do they only attack ships on 
their way to refuel at the gas giant, outside of the planet\'s sensor 
range??

On the Benefits tables in character creation, there are four ships 
you can get, the Free Trader, the Scout, the Yacht, and the Lab Ship. 
The descriptions in the text only cover how the character gets the 
Free Trader or Scout. If a noble or entertainer receives a yacht, 
does he own it outright, or does he have to make payments on it? If 
an academic has a lab ship, does he make payments, is it on loan from 
his university/academy/patron, or does he own it outright.

If a noble has a yacht, and wishes to sell it in order to purchase a 
free trader, what are the protocols involved here? The Yacht has a 
list price of 33 MCr, the Free Trader about 31 MCr. Could she just 
make the exchange. Would she have to sell it at a discount, and 
purchase as much of the trader as she could, and mortgage the rest?? 
The character has a good reason for doing this. She is the 10th 
daughter of the late Count de Bessie, and did not receive much in his 
will. Her elder brother has essentially kicked her off the planet, so 
she has decided to seek her fortune in commerce. A yacht is pretty 
useless for this, but a free trader would work. The other PC\'s would 
be the crew, and she would travel aboard as the captain-owner. If she 
owns the ship outright, she could either have inherited it from her 
father or have it given to her by the new Count in order to get her 
off the planet. If this isn\'t generally the case, then I\'ll have to 
come up with something else. (The practical reason for the trade is 
that the player who rolled up a merchant character failed to roll a 
ship, and no one has enough money to put a down payment on even the 
smallest starship, and we do want a commerce campaign).

These are the questions I have right now, but I may have others 
later. Thanks in advance for your help.

most countries:

Material currently "in print" may be copied to a *limited* extent. Firstly
it may only be copied for research or personal use. Just what is personal
use is a little fuzzy, but the actual law comes down on the side of the
copyright holder as a rule. Secondly the amount of the item which may be
copied is limited, around 10%. So one can legally copy the tables and charts
in the back of Pocket Empires for instance, but one can not copy the entire
publication. If material is copied for research and then included in another
publication, this is legal, but if the material is directly reproduced it
must be done as a "short" quote and it must be attributed. Good rule of thumb
for in print material: when in any doubt, don\'t.

Material "out of print" may be copied in its entirety for research or personal
use only. *IT MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED IN ANY WAY* (ie you can photocopy High
Guard (just) for your own use, but you can not photocopy it and then give the
copy to someone else). Just what constitues "out of print" is again a little
fuzzy. As a rule of thumb, the last published edition must be at least 10
years old, the publisher must not carry it in their "catalogue" and show no
signs of intention to reprint, and finally the publication must be "generally
unavailable". Note under this provision you *may not* copy a copy.

As to Marc\'s (very generous) comments on coping. It in no way invalidates
the copyright on the material (the material remains copyright). At the best
it can be taken as declaring that the material is out of print and it\'s
probably not even that.

Hope this helps clarify things.

But isn\'t  "crazy loner scientist creates intelligent humanoid robot
while multi-trillion dollar R&D company has trouble working toaster"
somewhat canonical in Traveller.  In the DGP adventures published in
Travellers Digest Dr Theodore Krenstein created the pseudobiological
robot AB-101 (aka Aybe Wan Owen) pretty much on his own, albeit with the
help of grad students etc.

Dr Krenstein is Int F, Edu C and Robotics -5 but should he really have
been able to create such a breakthrough on his own ?  I will believe Dr
Krenstein as the head of a multi hundred mega credit research project of
a megacorporation or the government, but the idea that he could do it
more or less by himself is somewhat questionable.  As built AB-101 was
only pseudo intelligence and he did not actually become "intelligent"
until after some Hivers put some experimental TL-16  chips in his
otherwise state of the art TL-15 workings.

It is of course possible that AB-101 is not as much of a breakthrough as
Dr Krenstein believes he is (due to pride in his own work) and that a
robot of AB-101\'s sophistication could have been made by any of the
other (a few dozen or so, perhaps ?) TL 15 Int F, Edu C, Robotics-5
experts in the Imperium.  (Note that Dr Krensteins skill level 5 is in
CT and MT terms, not T4  terms.)

After all, if goods are being sent out by jump, what would be the point
of a highport in low orbit, besides the nice view? If a "standing jump"
is the standard, it would be more time efficient to have the highport at
the 100 dia limit. There is just one decelleration phase, so the trip
would be shorter, as the ship reaches a higher velocity. With a port in
orbit, you have two decellerations: from surface to port, then from port
to jump-point.<<



The 100 dia. limit is not one point in space, but a sphere.(as has been
pointed out in another thread) The odds of a ship coming out of Jump near
this *Farport* are slim, assuming there are multiple trade routes to the
system.  Even with only one route you need to take into account the other
planets in the system which could impose their own 100dia. limits upon the
Farport when their orbits brought them into range of it.  I do like the idea
of a Farport, but it is useful in limited situations and then only if the
planetary orbits of the system allow it.

As far as X-boat stations are concerned, they would work great as Farports
because they would mainly handle out bound messages sent to them from the
home planet.  They also would workwell from asteroid bases, and small
uninhabitable planets on the fring of the system, because their 100 dia.
limit would be smaller (because their dia. are smaller) thus ships could get
to the Jump piont quicker.

Except that we\'ve not heard from Marc as to whether HE still holds the rights 
to such material and can legally waive the copy restrictions.

The way he stated it, it seemed only to be his generous OPINION and nothing

I read a review of Universe when it came out; the reviewer really, really
didn\'t like the mapping system and thought it was unplayable.
I didn\'t buy it as a result (also, I was pre-teen at that point,
and was just starting to actively wargame).  I would love to have

Yep, I agree. And I wish that someone would reprint those books, as mine are,

Jump points refer to the actual coordinates one would choose when
jumping, or the coordinates where a jump took place (after the fact).
Jump point is akin to the term "breaking point"-- at which time you go
bonkers and run out into the street naked and screaming at the top of
your lungs.  "Breaking point" isn\'t really defined as a specific set
of circumstance that will trigger such behaviour, but it works after
the fact (ie: Joe just hit his breaking point :)

Piracy often takes place in and around gas giants, but can take place
elsewhere.  Just because something takes place within the 100 diameter
limit does not necessarily mean that the local authorities can get
there in time to prevent it.

I believe that the Yacht is owned outright, while the Lab ship is most
likely part of a government or corporate grant provided to the
scientist and is purely on loan.

Allow the character to begin play with the yacht at the moment she is
kicked off planet.  Selling the yacht and buying a trader could then
make a very interesting game session or two (she could even meet her
soon-to-be crew during these game sessions).  All you need to do as a
referee is determine the condition of the yacht itself so that a fair
selling price can be obtained (via the rules regarding such skills as
Broker or Administration).  Once the character ends up with a specific
sum of money, she can begin looking for a used trader locally or
perhaps travel to an adjacent star system (leaving room for additional
roleplaying).  The amount of money she gets for selling her yacht will
determine the size and condition of the trader she will eventually end
up with (I prefer the older, rustic bargain of a trader to a newer,
smaller one for the same money-- older ships have more character :)

You\'ve got it right.  The jump point is the point the ship jumps into
jumpspace.  This can actually be anywhere--even in a ship hangar on a
planet.  The problem is...it is not that safe to jump that close to a
gravity well.

So, there\'s the 10 diameter and 100 diameter limits.  Get away from a
massive body by about 100 diameters, and it is pretty safe to jump at
that point--any point.

Private Pirates?  Hey, I like that!

For most ships, especially those with 1 G maneuver drives, it is several
hours from the point they enter normal space in a system to the
destination planet.  This gives pirates plenty of opportunity to pounce
on some prey.

Just because the ship is in communication with the starport, it doesn\'t
mean that there is a patrol ship close enough to intercede in the fight.

Many times, pirates will attack. The victim ship will radio in.  Minutes
later the message is received at the star port (communication travels at
light speed, which can still take it some time at those distances).  A
ship is dispatched (if there is any there to dispatch--many times the
answer to this is no.  The pirates usually know where the picking is
good).  By the time the rescue ship gets to the downed ship, the pirates
are gone out with there loot.

Now, as a GM, you can get real creative with this.  Is there a patrol
vessel within range to intercede with the pirate attack? Is this attack
taking place in an asteroid belt where there are plenty places for
pirates to attack?  Maybe the attack took place as the victim ship was
trying to refuel at the gas giant, and the pirates caught the ship on
the far side of the planet--where there is not line of sight between the
ship and the starport, effectively blocking communications.

It\'s your universe.  You decide how it goes down, and watch your players
try to wiggle out of it.

The first time a character receives a ship benefit from mustering out,
he receives the ship but still owes the payments on it.  The benefit got
him the down payment and the ship.  The second time he receives it, 10
years is paid off.  He still owes the rest.  From there on out, 10 years
are paid on this ship after every ship result.

If

You are the GM.  Decide how this is handled in your game.  I could see
it going either way.

He doesn\'t own it outright, so he cannot sell it.  I have gotten
creative with this before with characters.  Since the character is a
noble, you might want to give the equivalent of his ownership in the
ship to the character in cash.  This allows the noble to start the game
with a huge bank roll.  Or, you can say that the noble has another
business (maybe equity in the starport on his home planet), and the
amount determined is how much the business is worth--or whatever your
creative little mind comes up with.

No problem.  Hit us all with any questions you might have.  But,
beware--you\'ll probably get more answers than you wanted, and I\'m sure
not all the answers will be agree.

But, hey, that\'s what this list is all about--the free discussion of
Traveller.

Again, welcome.

Actually, thrusters can "shoot through" the hull of a ship.  So, it is
possible to orientate the ship without realigning the thing.

But, thrusters are designed to produce thrust in one main direction. 
Usually this is to the aft of the ship.  The thrusters can be used in
"reverse", but at 10% the thrust if the ship moved "forward".

Likewise, 25% of the thrust from the thruster can be used to the
"sides--port and starboard" of the plate.

Can it be done?   Yes.  Is it efficient without realigning the ship? 
No.

You may want to find a copy of Starship Operator\'s Manual Vol. 1.  It
was published by Digest Group Publications for MT and is out of print,
but it is a great supplement for any era of Traveller and worth buying
if you ever find it used.

Another thing to remember.  At 100 diameters away, the orbital circumference 
is about 628 diameters in length.  So, unless there were plenty of pirates or 
a common \'jump-in\' point, it would be very hard to be profitable at these 
distances.

There are also 31,000+ square \'diameters\' of space to patrol strictly on the 
plane of rotation.  Obviously much more in the cubic, but I forgot the math 
for that :)

Whew...that\'s a lot.

I\'ve refrained from replying to direct insults, but now you take the Lord\'s 
name in vain, for which I am sure you will not apologize, no matter how 
offensive your behaviour.

As for the topic at hand, I am content to let it drop, but this is a legal 
issue.  There are many on this list who are \'lurkers\', only reading and not 
replying.  Some are still young and impressionable and while I would never 
dictate to anyone what their chosen behavior must be, it is a misuse of this 
list and the internet to openly encourage the violation of any law, including 
copying of an author\'s intellectual property.

And thank you very much, I *DO* have a \'grip\'.  It seems the others on this 
thread do not, in defending illegal behaviour.

If you want to let it go, then please do.  Note, I have only responded to 
others, not dredged this up on my own.  Let it go, and I will not respond to 
it.  I\'d prefer we stay on topic.

Well, I know that we can make something similar *now*. In fact, this
likely traces back to the use of collidion (celluloid dissolved in
alcohol) as an "instant bandage".

True enough. But I like the idea of there being a few *permanent*

Yes. Copyright law includes the right to re-sell your copy. You may
also xerox or otherwise reproduce copies for archival purposes (ie, you
copy the book, then work from the copies so as to not wear the original
out). But when you sell, you must either destroy the copies, or
transfer them along with the original.

This is why so much software has "license agreements". This is an
attempt to *limit* your rights under copyright law, and many clauses
may not stand up if seriously challenged by someone who can afford to
fight through the appeals.

Well, partially it\'d be a case of just porting the old software to new
hardware, which if the hardware is "provably correct", gives you a
speed increase without any increase in bugs. 

Then you do the "usual" painstaking correctness proofs for any software
mods.

For example, the original planetary size scale was based on the

And the vector movement system used ??? thousand miles as the distance
unit.

Ah yes, nice scientific and rational... Like having your unit of mass

*That* I can answer for you.... 

Remember, the IISS still *owns* most of the Type-S ships running
around. So they\'d have to approve of such a major change. And while
they\'d likely have no trouble with the drives getting swapped. they may
be a bit more picky about the sensor suite.

So I picture some large burly men in IISS uniforms showing up and
"insisting" on having a talk with the president of Famille Spofulam.

Nope. If it is properly copyrighted and registered, it does not matter
whether you sold the copy or gave it away. The punitive damages can be
anywhere from $100 to $10k *per copy*. 

If the copyright wasn\'t registered until after the violation, then you
can only sue for actual damages. Which would be kinda hard to prove in
a case like this. But you could still prevent the person from making
any more unauthorized copies.

I\'m sure that GDW registered their copyright (they\'d have been fools
not to). So if the copyright holder decides to sue someone for copying
traveller materials, it could cost the copier *lots* of money.

Also note that the copyright holder is allowed to decide when to sue or
not sue. It\'s not like trademark law where failure to "defend" a
trademark can lose ther trademark. A copyright holder can ignore the
fact that Joe made 10,000 copies, and sue Tom for making 1 copy. And it
won\'t help Tom at all to bring up Joe.

That\'s why when building a provably correct CPU, you work the state
logic thru formal proofs. They haven\'t (yet) built a provably correct
processor as complex as a Pentium (to my knowledge). But I\'m sure that
they will eventually. 

The trick is that if you can verify the "state machine", then you
*don\'t* have to check all the possible states. Just like in
mathematical proofs, where you don\'t have to check the infinite
possible cases, because the cases follow logical rules.

Which is why I see much of the user/program interaction as the user
using his intuition/training/experience to suggest which alternatives
to prioritize. For example, a chess grandmaster watching some sort of
summary output of the move trees the computer is evaluating, and
inputting his suggestions as to likely branches to investigate.

For "programming", it\'d be a case of the grandmaster "fine tuning" the
move evaluation function. that\'s *not* a matter of program logic, it\'s
an "arbitary" assignment of relative values. It usually winds up as a
sort of glorified "lookup table". So you can greatly affect the
program\'s success by changing the values in the "table", yet you aren\'t
modifying the *program* at all! And in fact, a chess program might be
*deliberately* set up to allow modifying the table, so as to help
figure out what "values" its *opponent* seems to assign to things, so
that it can better predict his moves!

Likewise, a gunnery program would have the user suggesting possible
course changes of his ship or the target. And "tuning" the program
would be a matter of changing "rule sets" for the behavior of enemy
ships based on past experience ("He shows definite signs of
two-dimensional thinking...")

A *lot* of software is wholly or partially "expert systems". And for
those you have the program, and a set of "rules" it uses to obtain
solutions. The rules are "taught" by example in some cases (analyzing
past decisions/battles), and in others the rules are explicitly stated.

Either way, the validity of the expert systm in independent of the rule
set. The rule set is just the program\'s "experience". And just like a
poorly trained person, a program with a bad rule set will screw up.
Unlike a poorly trained person, you can easily "retrain" the program. 

So I expect that gunnery programs (for example) are pretty standard,
and fairly cheap. The standard ruleset has been well polished by
analyzing centurkies of battles. Even so, there are "custom" rulesets
(or additions to the standard set) that every gunner swears by. 

And of course, Naval vessels and the like have specialized rulesets
available for every ship they expect to encounter. Based on both
analysis of battles, performance, and even psychological "analysis" of
what is known about the officers of the ships!

Of course the players can\'t afford this, except maybe for a few ships
they keep running into. On the other hand, unless they\'ve made quite a
name for themselves, the Navy won\'t have them on file either.

BTW, this is another reason why being known as "mercenaries" is a bad
idea. It makes it far more likely that the opposition will have a
"tactics" file on you. :-)

(a) how fast can thrusters turn a ship?

(b) how fast can "reaction drive" ships turn?

When working out "to hit" probabilities (as discussed in earlier TML 
postings), during the "detect-fire-hit" time the ship can have moved 
to anywhere in a sphere whose diameter depends on how much acceleration 
and which direction you use it in.  If the ship can only turn 
relatively slowly then it has a much smaller volume to "hide" in.

In the CT days we used to hand wave all of this away ... what did it 
matter if the ships were 30,000 km or 300,000 km distant if the referee 
states "you have a DM of X to hit, you will have reached safety after 
10 turns".  Ship combat was thankfully rare in the CT campaigns I 
played in and ran.

These days, however, my gaming has a much higher gearhead content 
(partially due to computers at home and work), which is why I love FFS, 
Bruce Macintosh\'s sensor rules and so on.

In my opinion of game balance, the character needs to make payments on the yacht 
(or lab ship), but in my view this is hard work to fit into a campaign, as a 
yacht/lab ship is not too good for trading in!

I can make some suggestions based on T4 rules, or I can hark back to earlier 
Traveller rules, or a bit of a mix!  These days, I always go for the option that 
gives a interesting adventure hook.  In Traveller:The New Era a "yacht" could be 
anything from a scout ship to a trader to a "proper" yacht.

Idea 1
======
The daughter is kicked of planet with enough high passages to get to a nearby 
world where her father had some investments.  Her brother has "generously" given 
her ownership of the familiy\'s (small) investments on the world, knowing them to 
be unsaleable.

When the daughter arrives on the planet she presents her credentials to the 
managing director of the company she now owns 25% of and discovers that she can 
only sell the shares to existing shareholders, none of whom can afford to turn her 
shares into cash.  In fact, the company is doing so badly that it may become 
bankrupt at any time.  One of their latest headaches is the fraud perpetrated by 
the previous captain of the company\'s free trader "Free Enterprise".  All of the 
old crew had to be sacked because of probable involvement in the fraud.

The MD would love to be able to send one of the shareholders on the ship as "owner 
aboard" with a new crew, but no-one wants the job, unless ... surely *you* don\'t 
want the job?

Her first problem as "owner aboard" should be to get a crew and start making money 
to repay the ship loan that will otherwise cripple the company.  However, no 
sooner has she travelled to the berth where the ship is than a writ is served by 
the slick lawyer of one of the prevoius crew (a player character) claiming unfair 
dismissal.  The ship is likely to be kept here as "evidence" unless she re-hires 
the crew member at once.  She does not like blackmail, but bankruptcy is an even 
uglier word ...

Idea 2
======
The 50-year-old yacht is fully owned by the character, but it is worth a lot less 
than a new ship.  In fact it is nominally worth 20% of "new" ... which is just 
enough to make the down payment on that brand new, latest-tech free trader she saw 
just the other day ... the original purchaser ran into problems (he died) and the 
bank is looking for a quick re-finance deal.  

A new free trader is just what she wants, she has the business plan all sorted out 
and the bank have given informal approval of the deal.  All she needs is a 
suitable crew ...

Idea 3
======
Swap the 50-year-old yacht for a 50-year-old free trader (there is an old captain 
who wishes to retire, but could never afford a new yacht.  He has enough money to 
fuel and maintain a yacht for many years).

And he\'s absolutely right.  When a customer isn\'t brow-beaten they come
back for more - in this case, more traveller material.  This is the way
I\'d run my business as well too.  Profit is one thing, but the world\'s
largest profit margin is meaningless if there are no buyers.  A lot of
large scale corporate types often forget what Marc knows intrinsically.

It has been over six months since I left the compulsory Finnish Army
service, but IIRC the barrel of an assault rifle is pointed slightly
upwards. This is done because then the sights can be calibrated for a
certain range. The bullet flies in an arc and hits the target in sights
the designated distance away.

Which just had me wondering, are there any modifiers in use for using "iron
sights" under differing gravities. A weapon "sited in" on a 1 gee world
would be less than accurate on a .5 gee world, or a 1.5 gee world, correct?
If so does any one have a chart or formula for the modifiers? They may be
in the rules but I don\'t see them.

Another question, that I\'m sure has been answered before, but since my
system crashed I can\'t access any of my back information. Can some one send
the planetary size-to-gravity formula? I\'m looking for a general rule of
thumb type, discounting planetary make-up (assumption that it is identical
to Terra\'s).

Not fair, Leonard. The meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000th of the
distance from the equator to a pole. For a time the stick in Paris defined
the meter, but nowadays it is defined in terms of some wavelength or other,
and you can\'t get much more scietific than that, can you ;-).

Pirates are one of the elements of the Traveller Universe that unfortunately
dosen\'t make a whole lot of sense. It\'s a pity, because they are a lovely
evocative motif, but given the way space ships work they are not really
practical except in very specialized circumstances.

1) pirate ships are so expensive that a pirate can sell it and retire in
   comfort without having to risk his life going a-pirating. Also, repair
   bills for damage sustained while attempting the capture can easily
   cost more than the cargo you\'re trying to capture.

2) Hiding from patrol ships at the 100 diameter limit is impossible. 
   Hiding on a planet means a race to overhaul the prey before it
   reaches the jump limit. Hiding in a Gas Giant means your chance of
   detecting a refuelling ship is very small (A Gas Giant is big; the
   chance that a ship will decide to refuel close to where you are

If the local authorities have a few patrol ships, they can place one near
the jump limit and create a safe arrival and departure zone.

But if your campaign plan requires some other arrangement, use some other
arrangement. The rules are there to help you, not to hinder you.

Good idea.

Not so, Kenneth. Disregarding the fact that catching a 1G ship before it
reaches the jump limit (or the 10 diamiter limit if things get desperate)
even with a 3G ship isn\'t trivial, the real problem is that an interstellar
state with just a single high-population planet can built enough ships to
make piracy _very_ hazardous.

If there is one stationed at the jump limit, then it and the merchant ship
are closing at 4G while the pirate is overtaking at 2 G.

If the pickings are good then all the more reason to station a ship there.
Pirates only thrive when the number of places they can lie in wait for
prey vastly outnumbers the number of navy ships out looking for them.
That would not be the case around most planets with any sort of population.

Stationing a patrol ship (or a dozen) near a Gas Giant is not much of a
problem. Though why anyone should do that when no merchant would bother
to refuel at one if he had any choice is a question in itself.

I suppose that in Milieu 0 there may be some trade routes where merchant
ships will have to refuel at gas giants, but they would be few enough
that there wouild be plenty of patrol ships available to cover them.

That he personally thinks it\'s OK to use a photocopy if you can\'t find a
\'real\' copy of your own. That\'s his opinion as the Person Most Likely To
Get Miffed And Take Action.

I\'m reminded of something Dave Nilsen said to me once - that Roleplaying is
a funny field where copyright gets a bit fuzzy. A group of eight players
all passing a single rulebook around, using it to generate characters etc -
that borders upon the \'All rights reserved, no part of this book..." etc
prohibition we see in the front of most fiction and non-fiction books (it\'s
not there in Pocket Empires, the first Trav book that came to hand.)

Now I\'d object strongly to someone photocopying my books (non-gaming
related) because I want folks to buy them. Copying a few pages for
reference is legal, and OK in my opinion. But not the whole book.

Now, supposing in 20 years I\'d done a new edition, with lots of the
information in the present edition left out. I\'d not object to someone
getting a copy of the old book for reference - if I were sufficiently
confident that the new version was better by a big enough margin to still
be desirable. Still technically not legal, but it wouldn\'t hurt me, so if
somebody wanted the information and couldn\'t get a real copy because it\'d
gone out of print, then fine. I\'d take no action.

Distributing copies for a fee - THAT I\'d jump on!

I\'d guess Marc\'s position is similar. He wrote Traveller because he wanted
to play it. If, 20 years on, people STILL want the original materials - and
there\'s no chance of a reprint - then let\'s be realistic. A few people
exchanging photocopies isn\'t going to hurt - in fact it\'ll help maintain
interest. I think it\'s still illegal, though, so don\'t advertise what
you\'re doing too loudly. Most of the people who want CT/MT material are
Collectors (yes, capital C - the ones who just have to own everything).
They\'ll still want the books, so where\'s the harm?

If it starts to hurt IG, then that\'s another matter.

But if a few people wanted my books badly enough to hunt down out-of-date
imprints and copy them 20 years on, I\'d be flattered. Just so long as they
were buying the new ones too!

IMNSHO, one of the worst Traveller designs was the corasir.. IMTU, pirates
operate out of small scouts and traders, and depend on stealth and guile.

Unless you also sneak two crew members aboard the target ship to try a
hijacking at the time you are manuvering to intercept.

Which is why, historically, pirates operated far away from the big powers,
and tried to gain legitmacy by becoming privateers.  You\'re not going to
find pirates around Rhylanor, they\'ll be sneaking around the smaller
systems, waiting for a target of oppotunity.

Most pirates are also legitimate merchants, who have decided to add a
source of income that is frowned upon.

Except that the 100-diameter limit for Earth is a sphere with a surface are
of roughly 5.2x10^12 km.... quite an area to patrol effectively!

Piracy will be a transitory problem.. lasting a few months at most until
the locals/Imperium shift enough assets to deal with the situation.  The
smart pirate captain makes a hit and moves on, the dumb ones.. well. let\'s
just say they roll a "2" on the CT Survival roll....

You can find out all about the latest incarnation of Traveller (aka:
T4) at the following URL:

http://www.imperiumgames.com/

T4 is designed by Imperium Games, headed by Marc Miller after GDW
closed its doors two years ago (TNE stood for "Traveller: The New Era"
and it was the last incarnation of Traveller put out by GDW).  Both
Marc (CardSharks@aol.com) and Loren (GDWGames@aol.com) post on this
list from time to time.

TNE is much more complicated than T4 and was built around the rules
system that GDW was using for all of their roleplaying games
(Twilight: 2000 most notably).  Some people claim that it isn\'t "real"
Traveller because a few things were changed since the previous
incarnation of the game (like replacing thruster plates with actual
reaction drives).  TNE was very well written... it was just a pretty
big step from CT (Classic Traveller) and MT (MegaTraveller).

T4 was written by Marc Miller last summer in an attempt to bring back
the classic "feel" of the 1977 game.  It is far from a simple
reprinting of the original CT rules, however.  It is simpler in design
than TNE, but future source books like "Fire, Fusion, and Steel (T4
edition)" will allow players to add complexity as they see fit.

Be forewarned, however.  There is much debate on this list as to the
quality of T4 merchandise at the moment.  "Starships" and "First
Survey" were *not* well received by the Traveller public at all, and
some of IG\'s other releases have not done much better.  "First Survey"
and "Milieu 0" are to be combined into a single hardback tome in the
next month or so called "Milieu 0 Campaign" and I believe "Starships"
is also going to be rehashed for a second printing.

I would recommend continuing with your little black books for the next
few months until the second printing of the T4 rules are released
(destined "T4.1").  T4.1 should fix many of the problems with the
original T4.  After that, I would recommend looking at any of the
other books first, *before* you buy them.  If this isn\'t possible
where you live this mailing list has many members that are willing to
describe them in more detail for you.

Good luck and welcome to the fold!  If you kept your greeting message
from this list (and you did, didn\'t you :), you can use the
information provided to search the list archives as well.

But these are humans, Aslan are suppose to be aliens.  They will have
variation, but it will be about a standard that is fundamentally
different than the human.  They may range from being unable to even
concieve of crossing gender rolls (a male stands around on a sinking
ship becuase there is "nothing he can do") to those who allow the
lines to be blured (like women shooting artillery direct fire) or
emergency exceptions.

Welcome, Traveller!

 What are the new t4 and tne things you
> are talking about?

First,there was Traveller in the late 70\'s and early 80\'s.  We refer to
it as Classic Traveller now, or CT--like classic coke or classic Trek.

This era covered the years 1100-1115 or so in Imperial history.

Then, all hell broke loose in 1116 when the Emperor Strephon was
assassinated!  The Imperium broke into several factions, and a second
Civil War started.

It was devestating.  This era in the Imperial calendar was hearalded by
a second edition of Traveller.  The game was 10 years old, and it was
time for a new rules set.  A task system was introduced, and much of the
CT rules were revamped.

This was called MegaTraveller.  We refer to it on this list as MT.

The war raged on, with no resolution in site.  The elements basically
fought themselves to death.  By 1120-1130, the Imperium reached an era
called Hard Times.  This was a subset of MegaTraveller, and it used the
MT rules.  You could see a noticeable difference in the
Imperium--namely, there wasn\'t one.  The Imperium\'s enemies attacked
from all sides.  The Vargr invaded and captured many worlds on the
Imperium\'s coreward border.

Imperial citizens did what they could to survive.

And, it never got better.  During the war, a doomsday weapon was
released.  It was a computer virus that developed true artificial
intelligence.  It got into everything and destroyed everything in its
path.

Whole planets,dependent on protection from hostile atmospheres (or no
atmosphere) were destroyed when the Virus infected them.  Billions died.

This is the era of Traveller:  The New Era, or TNE as we call it.  The
Imperium goes through a period like the Long Night, and it is just
coming out of it.  People are starting to explore the neighboring star
systems again.  Pocket Empires are reaching out, trying to establish
trade agreements.  Pirates are taking advantage of the situation.  It is
live or be killed.

This was the third edition of Traveller.  GDW totally revamped the
rules, which proved to be very unpopular with many old time Traveller
fans.  The rules now were converted to GDW\'s house system, the system it
used for Twilight 2000 and other games.  Gone were the standard D6\'s. 
In were the D10\'s and D20\'s.

The TNE rules are very detailed, but the price paid was that it would
take you an hour to get through a simple one on one fight.

The TNE era begins in the year 1220--a hundred years after the origianal
CT Imperium was set.

Then, disaster struck for our favorite RPG.  GDW closed it\'s doors and
went out of business.

But, there was light at the end of the tunnel.  The rights for Traveller
reverted to the games creator, Marc Miller (who frequents this list with
questions for input as he designs T4 items).

Marc\'s company is Far Future Enterprises.  The company created to
publish Traveller stuff is Imperium Games, or IG.

Last August, the fourth edition of Traveller came out, called Marc
Miller\'s Traveller.  On this list, we refer to it as T4.

The idea here is to go back to Traveller\'s roots.  The game is based on
CT, with a face lift similar to the one done by MT.  A task system is
used, but many of the original CT game rules are keep intact.  The D6\'s
make their return.

T4 is really just updated CT, and many of your old CT items were work
with little or no conversion to the new game.

Marc\'s plan is to release products for many different Traveller eras--or
milieus.  Right now, there are several T4 products out (IG has been very
ambitious--there are over 15 products out since last August!).  All of
them are directed towards a specific part of Traveller history--Milieu
0, or M0.

This is the year 0 in the Imperium.  Cleon has just established the new
Imperium--coming out of the Long Night.

The M0 era will be from the year 0-200.  Then, as I understand it now, a
new milieu will be released--M200.  We\'ll learn about the Aslan Border
wars and such.

Somewhere down the road, there is supposed to be several milieu for
Traveller players to choose from and play in.  Do you want to play
during the first Civil War?  How about during the Solomani Rim war? 
During the Psionic Suppressions?

Whatever, it all sounds like fun.

And, that\'s the scoop.

Kenneth.

Thoughts on flywheel energy storage systems...

1) FFS2 ignores one of the principle advantages of FESS over
electrochemical cells, namely the lack of a cycling/deep discharge life
problem. They are in the rules as accumulators...

2) The technology is modular (usually). Ignore most of the energy and power
density figures quoted by manufactures of both FESS and electrochemical
cells, as they both tend to ignore support infrastructure, FESS less so.

3) Companies to keep an eye on - Trinity Flywheel in San Francisco (aligned
with Lawrence Livermore, and thus Richard Post, one of the pioneers in the
field), Satcon (they appear to have the *bearing* technology, and
International Energy Systems (UK).

I won\'t say much about the latter apart from I personally believe that they
have the edge in the time to deployment. But there again, they employ me.
(When the website goes on line I\'ll post the address if anyone wants it).

Richard Post\'s stuff is well worth reading.

  {
    'body' => 'For purposes of examining the Army as a mature force, and since it\'s where
my campaign is set, the example we will be looking at is the Lunion
Subsector of the Spinward Marches in 1105.  To start at the top, we have:

ARMY SUPREME COMMAND (Capital/Core)

This is the highest command authority for the Imperial Army.  This command
is concerned with the long range planning and defense of the entire
Imperium.  This unit organizes all R&D, mass equipment upgrades, and
changes in Army doctrine and regulations.  It has little say in the
day-to-day managing of line units; in fact it controls only one unit
directly: The Imperial Guard.

DOMAIN COMMAND: DENEB (Depot/Deneb)

Even though the Domain of Deneb does not have an archduke in 1105, the Army
maintains a level of command for the purpose of strategic planning "behind
the claw."  Officers assigned here have a better focus on the problems and
threats facing their area of operations.

Deneb Command also oversees the allocation of Imperial funds to the Sector
forces.  Many worlds in the Imperial Core do not bother with extensive
military development, and pay into a general fund rather than raising units
that are three years from the border in the first place.  The Supreme
Command allocates this money as block grants to the domains, who use it to
fund projects of local need.  Many times, this money is passed down the
line with no strings attached.  This is generally the case in Deneb, due to
the wildly varying threats the region faces.

Domain level commands control a small group of elite troops, rarely more
than a division, who act as a "fire brigade" for the command.  Since this
is traditionally the Marine mission, there is a great deal of friction over
these units\' existence.

SPINWARD MARCHES HIGH COMMAND (Rhylanor/Rhylanor)

The sector high command is the highest level of command that directly
commands regular Army units.  In a wartime situation, units leaving their
home Subsector come under the control of the sector command for the
duration of their transit.  Leaving this control only when the unit either
returns home or is handed off to a local command for combat.  The sector
command controls the reserves and logistics for the Army when it mobilizes.

The sector command also distributes funding to the Subsector Armies.  Since
planning is done decades in advance, each Subsector force submits an annual
update on its projected needs over the next ten years.  Budget allocations
are made based on both these figures, and on the needs of the sector as a
whole.

The sector command controls the strategic reserve for the sector.  This
consists of all Army units out of their home Subsector and in transit, as
well as all colonial forces (see below) committed to action.

LUNION ARMY HEADQUARTERS (Lunion/Lunion)

The Subsector Army is the heart of the Imperial defense.  Each Subsector
crafts its force to meet its unique needs and threats.  Lunion\'s main
threat is seen as the Sword Worlds Confederation.  Most of Lunion\'s
planning is based around a series of scenarios concerning a SWC attack on
the Spinward worlds of the Subsector.  Subsector command also gathers
intelligence about enemy activities and intentions; passing these nuggets
of information to Navy Intelligence in an attempt to paint a complete
picture of what is happening beyond the Imperial border.

Subsector Headquarters is where the actual purchasing of equipment takes
place.  Within guidelines from higher headquarters, each Subsector is
pretty free to equip its forces as it likes.  This leads to some oddities,
like Five Sister\'s small but potent Army, universally equipped with
battledress and fusion weapons.  Lunion has steered a more predictable
course; building fairly standard TL14-15 tank and infantry units.  As is
true for most Spinward Marches commands, Lunion Army makes sure that all
vehicles and personal armor are equipped with mind-shields in case of
conflict with telepathic Zhodani troops.

Operationally, the Army HQ coordinates the actions of its forces, plus
those assigned to it by higher command, in the defense of the Subsector.
If offensive operations are called for, Lunion forces may be seconded to
the assault force at the Sector Command\'s discretion.

The current commander of the Lunion Army is General Oiwaeas, an Aslan from
Strouden.  A 30-year veteran, Oiwaeas is a decorated veteran of the 4th
Frontier War, as well as innumerable border incidents with the Sword
Worlders.  Oiwaeas is much beloved by his troops as a fighting leader, and
his sense of humor is legendary.  (During one incident, a Sword World
commander insinuated that Oiwaeas need to go to the "cat box."  After
learning from an aide what was meant by the insult, Oiwaeas made a point of
dumping sand over the defeated SW officer\'s head, remarking "I understand
this is the proper thing for a cat to do with its waste."  To this day his
personal command vehicle is nicknamed CatBox.)

THE STROUDENESE ROYAL ARMY (Strouden/Lunion)

This is where the troops and tanks are found.  Strouden is a Hi-pop,
Industrial world of the Lunion Subsector.  Its total population is
8.3x10^9; mostly human with a significant (6%) Aslan minority.  The planet
is ruled by a constitutional monarchy.  The Grand Prince controls the
various government agencies, who operate as a meritocracy.

Strouden\'s Planetary Defense Force has approx. 7 million soldiers active at
any one time.  An additional 5 million can be found as reservists, home
guards, and local militias.

10% of the Strouden Army is pledged to the Imperial Army.  These units
receive TL14-15 equipment and training.  This amounts to 35 division sized
units (25 Lift Infantry, 10 Grav Tank) and a smattering of specialist units
(1 Rapid Interface Infantry Brigade, several battalion and smaller Civil
Action, Intelligence, Heavy Engineer, etc.)

The remainder of the units are organized as the Royal Stroudenese Army.
This formidable force can field 12 Field Armies equipped to TL13 standard,
along with 2 Corps equipped to TL14 (The Grand Prince\'s Guards and The
Landing Warders)

The local Imperial units and the RSA engage in regular wargames against one
another.  The RSA maintains a training area staffed by troops who use Sword
Worlds tactics and equipment for a realistic training environment; and many
Imperial units, both Marine and Army have praised it for the realism of the
exercises.

Although the Imperial element of Strouden\'s forces is answerable to the
Subsector command, the local government always has the right to veto any
off-world deployment.  This is a risky move, as it invites Imperial
displeasure, and any world making such a stand would best be ready to
present a very convincing case before the Moot.

The Imperial Army units on Strouden are fed, paid, clothed, and housed by
the RSA.  The Imperium picks up the bill for the high tech equipment and
training/deployment costs.  This benefits the Royal government greatly,
since they get a high-tech resident force at little expense to themselves.

COLONIAL FORCES

In times of great peril, such as a major war, planetary forces may be
volunteered for Imperial service.  Such forces are referred to as "Colonial
Units," and are generally considered to be of a lesser quality than
front-line troops.  Regardless, these troops can take a great deal of
pressure off harried commanders by assuming garrison and security roles,
freeing up units for the front lines.  Since these are not Imperial units,
their equipment and training can vary wildly, making it hazardous to mix
them with Imperial units.  During the 4th Frontier War, there was one
recorded case of an Imperial Marine point-defense system firing on
approaching colonials because their non-standard G-carriers were not in the
fire control computer\'s memory.

Funny, when I finally made the choice to purchase a Sci-Fi Role-Playing Game,
Universe was the only one on hand when visiting the bookstore.  I grabbed it
and thought overall it worked (it\'s been a LONG time since I looked at the
details of the game some forgive me if my hindsight is covered by rosey
glasses!).  I only lamented the fact that I didn\'t have DeltaVee to build
ships or play ANY type of space combat (anyone got a good connection on a
copy of this?)

As for the map, depends on how much effort you want to go through.  The bulk
of the map was a large circle showing space up to 30LY away from our sun.
 Every star was listed with the X, Y, and Z coordinate so you could calculate
distance between any two stars (formula given at bottom left of page) - being
a math buff this was enough for me.  To try to give you some perception of it
(never could myself), they divided regions of the Z coordinates ("above" and
"under" the page itself) with colors: red stars were further than 10LY above
the plane represented by the page, Yellow was the XY plane up to 10LY above,
etc.  THEN, if that wasn\'t enough, a bulk of what they considered the major
stars (I presume becuase they had the best chance of producing interesting
systems?) are listed in a "distance finder" type graph you\'d find on a state
map or something similar.  So these just outright told you how far the
distance was for those two points.  I suppose you could easily create some
type of cargo-liner routes that only used the stars listed as nodes.

Other than that, I remember LOTS of charts and map helps for the different
size worlds, modifiers for how far the environ you were currently in differed
from your home environ, Occupation kits (with "retirement" benefits), what
seemed to be odd combat resolution gyrations you had to do (characters lost a
varying number of points to differing characteristics themselves), and 40 not
quite detailed enough creatures to throw at players.  The book had one
example adventure, but no real GM helps to create their own adventures.

OK, so maybe my memories ARE stilted, but it sure beat the alternatives!

My understanding is that when GDW dissolved, the copyrights for all
published Traveller materials reverted to Marc. Therefore, if this is
correct, he does indeed have the right to give such permission.

Not necessarily. If you\'re deliberately sloppy about keeping the beam
properly collimated (focussed with no convergence or divergence), it
would only be dangerous for a few [dozen,thousand,zillion] kilometers
behind the ship. There\'d be some loss in thrust efficiency, but you
can pay for the extra fuel you need with what you save in liability
insurance. :)

Imagine the headaches for the folks over at Orbital Traffic Control.
They not only have to make sure nobody runs into anybody else, but
they have to keep everyone\'s thrust vectors from pointing at anybody
else\'s present *or future* location (speed of light problem). Ouch.

Fire,Fusion, and Steel for T4 is currently out. It adds dimension to many
aspects of Traveller ship and vehicle creation that were not present in the
original incarnation. But not as much as FFS1 (for the New Era rules). It
also suffers somewhat from Imperium Games chronic proofreading problems but
is well worth a look if you enjoy "gearheading", i.e. equiptment design.

Milieu 0 Campaign is also out. The first part of the book is detailed
information concerning the founding of the Third Emperium. The 3I
(shorthand reference) has been the setting of Traveller throughout it\'s
existance. With the latest version Marc and Co. have travelled back in time
to the founding of the Third Imperium. The original Taveller (CT for short)
was set in the early 1100\'s, approximately 1000 years after the current
setting. The second part of the book gives detailed Universal World Profile
data about the major sectors surrounding the new Imperium. Unfortunately
this section of the book could have bennifited from some more attention in
the reprint (IMHO=in my humble opinion). There are a lot of "problems" such
as tech levels that seem overly high, and worse, form my point of view,
many of the worlds depicted have starports listed that are top or near top
class, more than capable of constructing starships, in a time frame where
the Scouts of the new Imperium are supposedly making recontact with worlds
cut off for almost 2000 years. But this is just my opinion and if you
continue with this lists you WILL see plenty of varying opinions ;)

I agree. Much will apparently be changing with the rules in the near
future, however background books like Milieu 0, Psionic Institutes, and the
cream of IG\'s current crop  Pocket Empires, are worth a look.

    'body' => 'I just started fooling around with the QSDS (using the most recent 
version I found on the Web), and I wanted to see if I did my design 
correctly. There were parts of the process I wasn\'t sure I 
understood.
	For my design, I wanted to build a ship mentioned by Jim Vassilakos 
in his WORLDMAP.EXE program, the Vista Tender. Very little 
information was given about it. It was built on a Wedge frame 
of about 200 tons, carried two 24-ton short-range fighters in 
external grapples, had 1 triple laser turret on top of the ship, and 
could maneuver at 6 G\'s. It also had a crew of 4 (including the 
fighter pilots) and had fuel scoops and a purification plant.

There wasn\'t a 200-ton Wedge Shaped hull in the QSDS, so I turned to 
Brilliant Lances (the TNE edition) and built one from the Technical 
Booklet. The hull table in the QSDS seems to indicate that it 
includes life support, airlocks, artificial grav, etc. My 
computations are at the bottom.

First, the USD:
Vista Tender         Length: 42.5 m
Tons: 200 Wedge S    Volume: 2800 m^3     Cost: 267.3 MCr
Crew: 8              Passenger H/M: 0     Passenger Low: 0
Cargo: 0.34 tons     Controls: (TL12 Mil) TL: 12
8 Size Rating                     2 Jump Rating
0 Fire Control                    6 G-Rating/Maneuver Drive
L 3-Laser Batt.(+3)1/4-3-2-2    750 Power Plant
    (from TL11)                  48 Fuel Rating/Scoop 80/Refine 10
                                  0 Meson Screen
                                  0 Sandcaster
                                  0 Nuclear Damper
                                 2A 3P 0J Sensor Ratings
                                 70 Armor  12 Structure
Crew Breakdown: Engineering 1, Electronics 1, Astrogator 1, Pilot 1,
Gunner 1, Fighter Pilots 2, Command Crew 1
Carries 2 10-ton Light fighters (in the T4 rulebook) on External 
Grapples.

As you can see, I have several more crew than the original 
called for. I don\'t really know how to reduce it, as the only 
fractional crew was the Electronics, which was 0.8. There is another 
slight problem in that Brilliant Lances indicates that the Gravity 
Compensators from TL12 can only compensate 3G, while this ship 
maneuvers with 6. The cargo space is almost zero (about 5 cubic 
meters). The cost has *not* been reduced by 25% as the QSDS 
indicates. I worked the Structure rating from the SSDS 
(Brilliant Lances doesn\'t use it) only at the last minute. Finally, I 
changed the fighter to the 10-ton Light fighter because that\'s what I 
had stats for. 

Below is the worksheet calculations I used to arrive at these 
figures.

(1) The Tender needs 40 tons to make a Jump-2 by itself, or 44 Tons if
it is carrying its two 10-ton fighters. This leaves 4 tons left over,
enough to operate the Power Plant for 6 months.
(2) This battery is the Military Laser battery from TL11 that has 3 
lasers.

Here is the hull calculation I used to arrive at the figures for the 
hull above:

My questions are: where are my mistakes, if any, and how could I 
design this ship more efficiently? (more cargo space, cheaper, etc.)

   First off, a warning, the Battletech space combat system, Aerotech, is
truely a horrible thing.  It\'s beyond bad.

   The idea has some merit.  You\'re fearless players miss jump *way* off
course to a section of space where a minor human race never developed
comman sense, and anti-grav tech.  They have these giant walking armored
robots, 20-100 metric tons with really bloody awful targeting systems.

strong cable around their knees... :-)

Firearm sights are typically set up to be valid at the weapon\'s "typical"
range, and hence put the aim point of the barrel slightly above the
target.  As such, yes, you would need to adjust this for different gees,
though a trained and experienced marksman would probably do this
instinctively, correcting "by feel" for the local gee.  Alternatively, a
weapon could have its sights modified for a specific gee.

By the way, it\'s this built-in compensation for bullet drop at typical
range which leads to the phenomenon recently discussed here of tracer fire
from a "level"-aimed gun rising as it leaves the barrel; in reality, the
barrel is aimed slightly upward when the sights report a horizontal aim
point.

Assuming the same net density as Terra, G = (UPP Size / 8).  I wish all
formulae were this simple... :)  And by the way, this isn\'t an
approximation (other than the rounding involved in setting Terra as
exactly size 8); since mass for a fixed-density sphere is proportional to
R^3, and surface gravity to M/R^2, gravity winds up being proportional to
R.  I love the way that works out.

You don\'t know how hard I had to argue with my own people that we should let

so long as they put on a copyright acknowledgement. I did the same thing for
2300 AD and Twiligh: 2000.

I think they agreed because I spoke up, but the usual course is what TSR

So?

The metric system was in use in the scientific community in the 70\'s. 
Today the English system is *still* the official system in the US (and a 
number of other countries that I can count on one hand). Things are no 
different now then they were in the 70s.

Even in the 70s Metric was a scientific method of measurement, and 
Traveller was a Science Fiction game so it only makes sense that 
Traveller use metric.

Actually, I thought it was an iridium-platinum alloy, but I\'ll try not to 
be nitpicky. ;-)

I know your remark was in jest, but lets make a distinction between the 
irrationality of choice of base units and the rationality of derived 
units... since we can\'t count atoms directly we *have* to create an 
arbitrary unit of mass.

Heck, all base units are arbitrary, be they based on such-and-such a 
number of wavelengths of this-or-that, or defining the second as being 
1/blah blah-th the time it takes light to travel that far.

In many cases, there will be high traffic between only a few neigbouring 
systems. Most incoming ships will be coming from these incoming vectors. 
So one or two highports placed in an orbit synchronous with these 
corridors would suffice.

Realize that if a ship was jumping from system A to System B, about 50% 
of the entire surface of this 100 dia. limit of Homeworld B is "visible" 
from system A. The chances of other planets\' limits "blocking" the 
corridor are slim, to say the least. Other planets would only possibly 
transit Homeworld B\'s limit along a very thin area close to the orbital 
plane of system B. In other terms, Planets in system B can only block 
Homeworld B if the orbital plane is almost exactly parallel with the 
vector between Star A and Star B. And even if they could block, it could 
only happen rarely, during certain times of the year, or if the orbital 
period of the blocking planet was quite long, maybe during certain years

Space is big. In the majority of cases, it\'s going to be easy to plot a 
jump vector from one world to another without worrying about what planets 
get in the way. And three highports at 100 dia. for major systems should 
ensure that one will always be "clear" when viewed from a nearby system.

Well, a pirate ship would more than likely be stolen.  That\'s a hard thing to
resell, and at a lower profit margin than stealing other peoples cargoes.  Or
they could be barely spaceworthy, cobbled together wrecks with BIG guns.  As
far as damage from capturing other ships, if I were a captain of an unarmed

heave to, I\'d heave to because I\'d much rather lose my cargo than my life

I agree.  Give me a handful of small well armed ships, rather than a big Imp.

The local authorities are just that, local.  They have only limited funds to

Pirates are great plot motivators, they make fabulous reacuring villains, and
all around great suprise for the unsuspecting player.  Or, if your players
are bloodthirsty enough, you could run a campaign as pirates, then they\'ll
get a real respect for them as they flee from twenty Navy ships in their
modified stollen scout ship.

Well, I haven\'t followed the sensor range (though my experience is
that people overestimate, IMO at least, how well sensors would
work.).  The main point is that piracy will not occur around a
place like Regina.  It will occur in backwater systems and out
lying areas of modest systems where a ship can\'t be mobalized in
time to respond the distress call.

>Welcome, Traveller!

   Ditto.  And welcome to the Traveller Mailing List.  Some people
experience some culture shock when they arrive here.  Be aware of the
following:

1) If you try to read and respond to every single post, you will spend
your life reading and responding to every post.  Look for subjects that
interest you (or bring up a new one) and then send a post if you have
something to add.  All the other netiquette details have been covered in
a FAQ file which I\'m sure somebody will get around to pointing out to
you.

2) If you think you know everything there is to know about Traveller,
you will of course be proven incorrect (inevitably somebody knows more
in one or more subject areas, or thinks they do).  On the other hand, if
you are looking for answers to rules and background questions (or
practically anything else), this is probably the best place to get an
answer regardless of which version of Traveller you settle on playing.

3) People here at times get very passionate about Traveller, in much the
same way that people get passionate about the local hometown sports
team.  Keep that in mind when you see somebody questioning someone
else\'s gonad size or apparent lack thereof because of a differing
opinion about the significance of Vargr charisma, or some other such
aspect of the game.  We try to keep things relatively civil around here,
and pretty much are successful, at least in comparsion to newsgroups and
other areas of continuing Internet combat.  Should you find yourself the
subject of a flame mail, don\'t take anyone\'s opinions so seriously that
you allow it to upset you.  The idea here, as with the game, is for it
to be a pleasent experience.

   I hope that helps.

   By way of further explanation, Traveller ultimately culminated
storyline-wise with the end of the Fifth Frontier War and its aftermath
(along with some developments in the Solomani Rim that have implications
later on).  There were 8 books, 12 supplements, and numerous adventures
and special supplements produced for it between 1977 and 1986.

   It was in 1986 that Marc Miller and GDW decided that the "classic"
Traveller rules needed a tune up.  The game was approaching 10 years old
and starting to show its age.  Initially the changes contemplated were
relatively minor.  However, as the discussions continued, it was decided
that a major overhaul would take place.  The people behind Digest Group
Publications (DGP), which had developed a task resolution system to fit
the old rules (this appeared in their magazine Traveller Digest) and had
developed Book 8: Robots was tasked with making this happen under the
GDW name.

>Then, all hell broke loose in 1116 when the Emperor Strephon was
>assassinated!  The Imperium broke into several factions, and a second
>Civil War started.

   The result was MegaTraveller, which was published starting in 1987. 
MegaTraveller covered the era of the Rebellion, which lasted from 1116
to 1130 on the Imperial calendar.  A large number of sourcebooks were
produced for MegaTraveller by GDW and DGP (under license), as well as
adventures and other supplementary material.   Much of the development
of MegaTraveller from 1987 to 1991 was handled by DGP\'s staff, which is
why you hear people on this list refer to the DGP sourcebooks so much. 
The DGP sourcebooks were of excellent quality and covered areas of
Traveller in a depth never before seen.  They are still sought after
even today.

   For all the positives of the DGP\'s sourcebooks, unfortunately the
first printing of the basic MegaTraveller books (Referee\'s Manual,
Player\'s Manual, Imperial Encyclopedia) proved to be an errata filled
nightmare.  Just when it seemed that all the errors had been found, new
ones were discovered.  Eventually the errata issues were resolved, but
not before much damage had been done to Traveller\'s reputation.

   By 1991, GDW hired on Dave Nilsen to help rebuild GDW\'s Traveller
product line.  Some good GDW sourcebooks (i.e. Hard Times, Arrival
Vengence) came out of the final days of MegaTraveller (1991-1993). 
Little noticed by anyone at the time was a submission by a certain H.
Hale which gave extremely detailed design rules for drones in
MegaTraveller.  This earned him a seat at the table in 1992 when GDW
conducted its first and only official Writer\'s Conference, at which was
announced...

>released.  It was a computer virus that developed true artificial

   The computer virus was more than just a computer virus.  As discussed
above, an adventure was developed for classic Traveller called "Signal
GK".  The plot of the adventure revolved around the discovery of a
silicon based lifeform native to the Solomani Rim.  In Survival Margin
(the first TNE product, released before the basic TNE manual), we
discover that Imperial scientists took the lifeform found on Cymbeline
and developed it as a living transponder for ships (and it was very good
at what it did).  During the Rebellion, one of the factions saw the
potential of the lifeform as a weapon of mass destruction.  Efforts at
genetically manipulating it started immediately.  These succeeded in
turning the lifeforms into an ultimate high tech, AI killing machine
(Virus, so-named for its ability to destroy data and executable files
and transmit itself electonically), but as a weapon it had one flaw--it
couldn\'t tell friend from enemy.

>Whole planets,dependent on protection from hostile atmospheres (or no
>atmosphere) were destroyed when the Virus infected them.  Billions died.

>This is the era of Traveller:  The New Era, or TNE as we call it.

   The accidental release of Virus during a raid on the research lab
where it was developed finished off a great deal of whatever
civilization was left after the Rebellion (including some alien
civilizations that had only a minor role).  The Imperium was effectively
reduced to an area of a few sectors centered on the Spinward Marches,
called the Regency.  Among the other survivors were the Aslan colonies
on the spinward side of the Great Rift, the Zhodani, Terra (though it
suffered terribly), and the Hivers.  The primary storylines in the New
Era centered on the Regency and the states surrounding it, and a group
of human-dominated worlds called the Reformation Coalition, which
received help from the Hivers in their attempt to revive civilization in
their part of space.  Secondary storylines centered on so-called "pocket
empires" groups of usually a half dozen or less inhabited worlds that
were also reviving civilization or just hanging for survival.

>In were the D10\'s and D20\'s.

   TNE (first appeared in 1993, developed by Dave Nilsen, Frank
Chadwick, and Loren Wiseman, Marc Miller having left GDW for all
practical purposes in 1987) proved to have a very good system of game
mechanics.  Task resolution is done with a D20, hit locations are
determined with a D10, and damage points are resolved using D6 (some
people settled on using D10s to resolve hits from small arms for more
"realistic" damage effects).  GDW published all the sourcebooks (and
there were many) that were created for TNE, though some excellent TNE
material also appeared in Traveller Chronicle magazine.  TNE also saw
the appearance of "Fire, Fusion and Steel" a sourcebook that not only
allowed you to build most things appearing the Traveller universe, but
items of alternative technology as well (including thruster plates which
were dropped from TNE in favor of drives that use reaction mass).

  While the new mechanics were adopted by many older players (as well as
people new to Traveller), the new storyline proved to be much less
popular.  Quite simply, the impression that many people had was that the
Imperium was dead, and they didn\'t like the way the story ended.  Sales
of TNE products however were solid, that is until the RPG market came
unravelled--more on that later.

>The TNE rules are very detailed, but the price paid was that it would
>take you an hour to get through a simple one on one fight.

   Perhaps the first time through, with each time after that getting
progressively faster.  The best way to handle combat was to take a
gaming session to work through fire and unarmed combat rules before
actually getting into a game, that way players know what their weapons
(and fists) can do in game terms.

>The TNE era begins in the year 1220--a hundred years after the origianal
>CT Imperium was set.

   Actually it begins in 1201, approximately 70 years after Virus was
released.  TNE advanced the storyline up to 1202 before GDW went out of
business.  Material that regularly appears in Traveller Chronicle
magazine continues the timeline forward in the Solomani Rim, and there
have been discussions of a TNE wrap-up book, TNE storyline sourcebooks
for Marc Miller\'s Traveller, and even one rumor a someone tryng to get a
license to produce new TNE sourcebooks based on the TNE rules.  Nothing
definate.

>Then, disaster struck for our favorite RPG.  GDW closed it\'s doors and
>went out of business.

   The demise of GDW is the result of 8 years of assorted troubles,
starting with the problems with MegaTraveller, continuing with some
questionable game development decisions ("Dangerous Journeys", a fantasy
RPG developed by Gary Gygax, had mediocre sales and ultimately landed
GDW in court as a result of a lawsuit by TSR--it seemed that Mr. Gygax
had begun development work on DJ while he was at TSR, and according to
his departure agreement with that company, anything he developed while
there became TSR\'s property), and some just plain bad luck.  Still, it
appeared in early 1995 that GDW would be able to keep afloat, when WHAM!
Wizards of the Coast (up until now a small, slowly failing RPG company)
released "Magic: The Gathering" the first of what now seems like an
endless stream of collectable card games from various companies. 
Unwilling to join the CCG parade, GDW soon found that game stores would
rather stock WotC product than RPGs or even minatures rules (and with
good reason, game stores were making a *killing* on CCGs).  Distributors
reduced the amount of GDW product they carried, and some just stopped
altogether (TSR was also hit hard about this time--which is why they are
now owned by WotC).  

   By mid to late 1995, the handwriting was on the wall--too much damage
absorbed too fast.  Staff was cut, downsizing began.  Rumors started
that GDW was in trouble.  GDW issued denials.  One or two individuals
did some checking around and discovered that indeed GDW *was* in
trouble.  Dave Nilsen left the company.  Frank Chadwick tried to
continue, but to no avail.  The lights started to dim...

>Marc\'s company is Far Future Enterprises.  The company created to
>publish Traveller stuff is Imperium Games, or IG.

   Imperium Games is in fact the name which Sweetpea Entertainment
operates under when it does business as an RPG producer (the executive
officers of both companies are identical).

>Last August, the fourth edition of Traveller came out, called Marc
>Miller\'s Traveller.  On this list, we refer to it as T4.

   Or alternately MMT (short for Marc Miller\'s Traveller).  Use of MMT
began after some people became dissatisfied with the degree to which
Marc Miller\'s Traveller adheres to the generally accepted storyline for
the GDW version of the game (the rationale being that MMT was not a true
4th edition of the Traveller rules, but was in fact a completely new
game which incorporates some of the original story elements).

>The idea here is to go back to Traveller\'s roots.  The game is based on
>CT, with a face lift similar to the one done by MT.  

   In some ways MMT is what may have happened had Marc Miller stuck
around for the original CT revision that turned into MegaTraveller back
in 1987.  As with TNE however, some elements of it have been
controversial with long time players.  Some questioned the rationale of
yet another task resolution system (which itself has been controversial
because of its use of "half D6s", variable amount of dice used, and
other factors), while others didn\'t like the storyline changes that have
been made to the background history (most minor, but some of
significance).  Still others don\'t like the "Milieu Zero" (the founding
date of the Third Imperium) setting, which even Marc Miller has
described as (and I am paraphrasing here) "the TNE setting without
Virus".  MMT does bring back thruster plates as "canon" (part of the
storyline), but relies on FF&S for some of its design mechanics, and
incorporates new technology, Fusion Plus, as part of the background.

>A task system is
>used, but many of the original CT game rules are keep intact.  The D6\'s
>make their return.

   As noted above, it is not classic Traveller.

>T4 is really just updated CT, and many of your old CT items were work
>with little or no conversion to the new game.

   While certain items do translate well, your characters (depending
upon whether they were generated using the Book 1-3 rules or using 4-7)
will need to be regenerated.

   Some would say that IG\'s production schedule is part of why there
have been so many formatting and errata problems with MMT (particularly
the early products published in 1996).  More on this later.

>The M0 era will be from the year 0-200.  Then, as I understand it now, a
>new milieu will be released--M200.  We\'ll learn about the Aslan Border

   The basic MMT manual is currently undergoing a complete (and badly
needed) revision, the results of which, called by some "T4.1" are being
personally written by Marc Miller.  Setting will be the Imperial Year
100 (IIRC: if I recall correctly).  Other MMT sourcebooks also have
problems, most minor, some serious (if there isn\'t an FAQ file on them,
there should be).  People here will tell you which to buy and which to
avoid.

>Somewhere down the road, there is supposed to be several milieu for

>During the Psionic Suppressions?

   True, a great deal has been promised by IG.

   My advice is to take a "wait and see" attitude with regard to
purchasing MMT.  The "4.1" revision will almost certainly be worth the
wait (due out in November), since you apparently have no desire to track
down the GDW produced material (otherwise, I would suggest picking up
TNE for the game mechanics and choosing a setting to use based on what
your group wants--but I\'m somewhat biased).  There are also plans by
Steve Jackson Games to produce a series of GURPS sourcebooks dealing
with the Imperial setting, c.1116 using an alternative timeline (no
Rebellion).  Unfortunately that won\'t be out until January at the
earliest.

This may be.  I do think there are some faults with your analysis, but
I don\'t claim that this means there are no problems with piracy, I
haven\'t thought that through enough to be willing to say that...

You don\'t "hide" that way.  You pose as a normal unassuming ship
and then hit quickly and jump out.

Well, you actually need enough ships to cover the entire sphere of
the 100 diam limit.  Then you need to do that at every planet that
has traffic (population, mining, refueling, etc.).  I would say
that Regina can do this easily.  A small pop world might, for
example, only have one or two ships.  (Especially if you want
to take ships and group them into fleets for military purposes).

dammage ?

Every copy that came in to the game shop I order games for had slight
dammage to its corners.  The (major) distributor we got them from said
that _every_ copy they received had similar dammage.  They apparently
considered refusing the entire shipment.  They said they contacted
Imperium Games and were told that "this was the best they could do". 
The dammage was not sufficient to stop me from buying the supplement,
but is sufficient to stop some people.  Every copy had a bruised lower
right hand corner with about 3/4" crinkled.  The other 3 corners were
not as bad but all had the black binding already somewhat worn with the
white showing through.

These books had only travelled from the printer, to Imperium, to the
distributor and they were already dammaged.  This is a bad sign for
their long term wear value.

In fairness to Imperium Games I should note that it is not uncommon to
receive hardcover games from other companies with slight dammage but I
have never seen hardcovers that looked like this unless someone dropped
the box they were shipped in.  I do not know how many hundred copies my
distributor received but it seems unlikely someone droped them all.

It is my very fervant hope that this problem does _not_ recur with the
T4.1 hardcovers.

    'body' => 'Once people reverse-engineer Fusion+, a lot of things suddenly become
possible.  I\'ve looked at the canon version of TL10 ABD, and like the
progression to battle-pods at the later TL\'s (though I still think
that anthropomorphic-ABD will have tactical use no matter what TL you
are at).  However, I was at work and wanted to see what I could do
with "growing my own" ABD in Milieu 0 (since the 3I-issue stuff is
verbotin).  The following design is what I ended up with, and I\'ll
mention some possible errata that I encountered in Central Supply
Catalog as I come to it.  Please note that the example from the book
that I refer to is on page 19 of the CSC.

Homegrown TL10 Augmented Battle Dress:

These are, of course, approximate sizes...(I\'m a bit smaller :)

***Possible Errata:  The surface area in the example is broken, or the
rules on page 64 are incorrect.

0.396
     --TL10 Arms/Hands
     --0.044Mw (Str 16)

***Possible Errata:  It appears from both the text of the rules, and
the example of TL12 ABD given, that the arms/hands take up only 0.2 of
the same stat for the legs, except for taking up only 10% as much
surface area, and requiring NO additional power.  Is this correct?  I
went by the rules on page 66.

     --rating on Arms/Legs =3D 6 (0.73cm)
     --rating on Hands =3D 4 (0.21cm)

I chose TL7 Composite Laminate for the armor as it was easier to
calculate/work (all stats are "7"--it was 0300, after all :), and
because I wanted the surface to be non-metallic.  I got my numbers for
surface area to cover from the text on page 18 (left-hand column under
Armor Notes).

Options:
     --Basic Life Support	0.00043		0.00043		----
0.0258

This was a major pain to calculate, but I think that I derived the
values correctly.  I\'m assuming that even though this is only BASIC
life support that there is still some internal provision for nature\'s
call(s).

     --TL10 Fire Control	----		----		----

          --DM +2

Since there are no integral weapons, I\'m assuming that this works for
linked weapons, and supplements a PAWS-10.

I assumed that, since this is integral to the armor, full EMS sensing
wouldn\'t be included--thus, the Radar/Sonar only limitation.

I think that the example of ABD is broken, as the cost of its sensors
doesn\'t match what the tables say theu should be...comments?

          --TL10 Passive Optical

          --mil-spec

Please note that the example shows that the Passive Optical system
antenna takes up no area, though the rules on page 70 state that they
should take up 0.1 of the space as the Active sensors would at the
same range/power.  What\'s up?

     --TL9 Inertial Nav	0.0005		0.0005		----
0.2

There is no volume listed in the rules for this device on page 25 (or
33) but the example says that it is this big...

     --Sat Nav		0.0025		0.001		----
2.0

Though there are no rules for including this, I simply had it take up
5 x the space at the same mass (though it should probably be the same
size as well).  Roadgrid(tm) is the closest that the rules get to
mentioning this item.

There is a but load of information on this race on the net.  In fact,
the guy who wrote the TTC 5 article maintains a site.  You\'ll get what
was in the article and much more.

I think it was the HIWIG site--information on the Yxxxxxxx Sector.  I

You can link there from the Imperium Games link page.

I agree, after reading the rules through about 4 or 5 times, I can
remember the combat procedure better than I could for MT - which appears
to be faster but involves more strenous calculations (Didn\'t you know
CompSci students can\'t do basic math anymore ;)).

loyal to the game designers at the time.

My attitude towards these games that I enjoy so much hasn\'t changed
either.  In my opinion, Traveller is the ultimate "space game".  I have
Space Farer, Space Opera, Star Frontiers, Star Trek and many others; but
none of them (in my opinion), were put together as well as Classic
Traveller, in fact I always considered them the "B movie" type
copy-cats.  For instance, when "Star Wars" came out, soon there was a
proliferation of low-budget, bad-plot copies.  There always seems to be
such whenever something is a big hit.

It\'s not by Piper. I\'d ask your local bookstore to see if it is still

try Powell Books\' web site.

True enough. But they are just sections of the novel. They did the same

Space is *big*. 100 dia on a size 10 planet is what, 16 million km?
That\'s about a 10th of an AU. And most planets are a *lot* farther
apart than that. The odds of planets having their 100 dia limits come
close enough to worry about are pretty extreme.

Provably correct software already exists. It\'s mostly restricted to
things like controlling nuclear plants and other "cost is no object, it
must be *safe*" type applications. 

There\'s generally no *point* in trying to prove the correctness of
software if you don\'t have a proven correct *processor* to run it on. A
few such exist, but they aren\'t used in mass market PCs. 

And such things *will* evolve. Once you\'ve proven a program to be
correct, proving the correctness of additions or modifications is going
to be simpler than starting from scratch. But it does help if the mods
or add-ons are built using certain rules.

Although the U.S. Congress may still be pretty archaic, many specific
applications have converted to metric, especially in the scientific
community, but also elsewhere.

We do still have our highway signage, most supermarket measures, and
cooking instructions in metric, and those are some of the primary
"everyday" measures.  In fact, the biggest everyday metric measure I can
think of is that we buy our soda (pop, carbonated beverage) in 2-liter
bottles.

Other countries are still somewhat like this too though.  When I went to
"metric" Great Britain I bought my beer in "pints" and when trying to
follow a recipe from an English cookbook had a hard time converting the
"pounds of flour" to cups we use here.

To bring this kicking and screaming back into Traveller;  Would the office
of Calendar Compliance (or equivalent) attempt to bring all the
Sylean/Imperial worlds to a standardized system of weights and measures?
Human (and presumably other race\'s) Nature will bring forth a multitude of
ways of measuring stuff without some reason or enforcement of a standard
during the long night.

I can see arriving at a newly recontacted planet with their requested "300
tonnes" of electronics parts only to find out that *their* 300 tonnes is
twice what *standard* 300 tons is.

Not if stealing other people\'s cargoes is very difficult and dangerous.

Even a ship with a wear value of 10 is worth a lot of money. Lesssee: An
unarmed 200 T freighter is worth around MCr50 from new. 10% of that is
5,000,000 credits. Assuming the pirates don\'t pay income tax, hat\'s about
200 years worth of luxury living (~Cr2,000 per month).

So would I, but every Free Trader design I have seen have had provisions
for armaments. So if pirates are a hazard, then they risk running into
armed prey. It\'s not like it was in the old days on Earth, where proper
defenses required a large crew and was thus impractical for merchants.
And that\'s not even considering the risk of running into a Q-ship.

Yes it will, as often as possible. To a merchant time is money. Every hour
spent travelling to and from, and refuelling at, a Gas Giant is time where
he is not earning money. The loss of revenue is far more than the meager
savings on the fuel bills. No merchant will refuel at a Gas Giant if an
alternative exists. It is far too expensive. And that\'s not even counting
any risk of running into pirates.

But historically the number of places a pirate could hide in proportion
to the number of ships available to patrol was far larger than they are
in the Traveller Universe. A single high-population world can afford
_hundreds_ of patrol ships with 1/1000th of its naval budget. Provided the
TL is high enough, every planet of more than a million inhabitants can 
afford to secure it\'s own main world; every world with more than 10 million 
can afford to secure its whole system; every world of more than 100 million 
can patrol all worlds within one jump; every world with more than 1 billion 
can patrol its whole subsector and more; and any world with more than 10
billion can patrol an entire sector.

I could give you an argument about that, given detection and weapon ranges,
but its a moot point since they don\'t need to patrol it all. Just a small
slice of it that the merchants would all know of and use. Comparatively
small, of course; we don\'t want the merchants colliding.

See above. You don\'t realize just how many ressources even a small world can

I agree completely and I\'ve used them myself on occasion, conveniently

Thank you for speaking up - I suspect that this is the reason that you have
a lot of people who feel very strongly for these games, and maybe it\'s the
reason behind the \'canon\' attitudes that many people have. ;-)

From my own past, the out of print supplements that I photocopied have
gradually been replaced with originals as I hunted them down.

Interesting point - my players are currently playing Twilights Peak, and
are making a killing on the Empress Nicholle (a type A2 Far trader with 61
dt cargo for those of you not familiar with this CT and  MT classic!) ,
just dealing in freight. And they have an additional 250 kCr loan covering
expenses to pay off in 12 months...

but for some reason they nearly always refuel at the gas giant to save
expense. I may hit them with a late delivery penalty soon to encourage use
of mainworld refueling.

I think that the average merchant captain with a purification plant may
look at the expense of fuel at a starport as unnecessary.

Which of course assumes that the relative positions of gravitational fields
in jump correspond to their real space positions. I like the ideas you are
putting forward, but do wonder if we are going a bit far in the
explanations.

"Your ship tumbles into jump and you feel a slight feeling of nausea as
this  happens. The ship is surrounded by the jump bubble, slowly
disappaiting, and dangerous to look at. 168 hours +/- 10% later you emerge
in a reversal of the process."

This staright lines through jump space is very close to B5 and riding
beacons to jump gates...

This should all be taken with a pinch of salt!

Some other points:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Harold is editor of the Traveller Chronicle (which he mentioned a few
times) and what I have seen of it is not bad.

CT looks dated in some respects.
MT does have its errors, but isn\'t that bad.
TNE has an interesting background, but I *personally* find the rules
somewhat heavy going.
T4 has some duff products (First Survey and Starships), some okay products
(Central Supply Catalog, T4 rules) and some excellent products (Emperors
Arsenal, Milieu 0, and Pocket Empires). Fire Fusion and Steel would be
excellent if it wasn\'t for the typos.

But I would recommend waiting for T4.1 being released - if you want to
convert your T4 characters in the meantime I would recommend summing the
total number of skills, and dividing by the number of terms served. This
should total around 5 skills/term in T4. Allow your players to roll the
extra skills needed. Some skills have changed in the new edition - eg
Astrogation replaces Navigation. The task system for T4.1 has been released
for playtesting a while ago, and you should be able to get the difficulties
from the T4 screen. The CT ship construction rules are useable with T4 (I
do it all the time) but you should note that MT/T4 use a lower hull % per
jump number for fuel than CT and T4.

Easier said than done.

Pirates seldom turned privateers. Privateers sometimes turned pirate, which
was one reason why navy men generally disliked privateers, but privateering
was a legitimate enterprise while pirating wasn\'t. (And it wasn\'t just a
case of one side\'s privateers being the other side\'s pirates; the whole
point of having a Letter of Marque was to _avoid_ being treated as a
pirate).

>You\'re not going to find pirates around Rhylanor, they\'ll be sneaking

But such targets of opportunity will be few and far between. For one thing,
merchants will avoid intermediate stops as the plague. Every intermediate
stop where they don\'t discharge one cargo and take on another increases
the overhead and lowers the profitability of the trip. For another, planets
like Rhylanor can afford to station patrol ships in any adjacent systems.
When you\'ve got 20 patrol ships and 200 places to patrol, then pirates may
have a chance. When you have 200 patrol ships and 20 places to patrol they 
don\'t.

But the Imperium have enough assets that they never need leave any place
unaccounted for. They won\'t have to shift assets, because they really
should have them in place to begin with (And, yes, I know that\'s not
the impression many of the modules give us, but many of those modules

Yeah, I agree -- I understood Marc\'s original post, and subsequent

Control over the means of production, if that term isn\'t too Marxist for

I used to oppose the T4 task system because I felt it rated skills too
lightly (in relation to attributes).

Now that Marc has added a \'distraction\' rule for halving the attribute when
trying to do two tasks at once, I can live with the system.  This change also
supports the \'great minds\' proverb :-)

As a referee, I would apply the halving whenever a character (PC or NPC)
splits their attention.  If you have an engineer cross-trained in gunnery,
and during a battle they man the turret while between fights they fix the
drive, I would halve their attribute for the gunnery tasks because they
aren\'t keeping in training (even if they aren\'t actually being bothered by
questions from the engineers during the fight).  I don\'t know whether this is
what Marc intended, but it seems a logical extension of the rule and is how
_I_ always applied it when it was just a house rule of mine.

Not so arbitrary.  

The KG is (approx) the mass of 1000 cc of water.  Close to a pound (and other

Speaking as the person who did the calculations underlying the current
sensor model, I stand by them (at least for passive sensors.) Traveller
starship powerplants generate enormous amounts of power; if even a small
fraction of it ends up as waste heat, they glow in the IR like you wouldn\'t
believe. Cooled IR sensors in space can get tremendous sensitivity; good 
computers can process a tremendous amount of data to search for targets; 
starships have lots of surface area and money to spend on huge sensor
arrays; it\'s remarkably hard to hide. If anything, my sensor models were
too conservative - they (a) assume only 10% waste heat (which is a necessary
counter to the fact that all traveller systems take way to much power - 
"real" starships will have much less powerful powerplants, I think), (b) 
assume well-designed baffling means you can keep 90% of that waste heat
from being seen (by radiating in directions unlikely to contain hostiles),
(c) sensors are operated at about 150 K, (d) you need a 20-sigma detection
over 10 minutes to be sure you see a real target (should probably only be
10-sigma.)

The minimal set of circumstances for piracy to work, and for the economics
of space travel to work, is, I think, the following:

1.  Ships get cheaper
2.  Ships get easier to disable without expensive damage
3.  Cargos get easy to transfer or more value dense
4.  There is some way to get a ship outside easy sighting range for long
enough to take the goodies.

I have my solution that I can live with for #4.  I am trying to decide
between using 1 or 2 as my primary way of making piracy work.

It does bother me that any free trader crew is megarich by any conceivable
standard.  Were they to settle down, they could all live the lives of
princes and kings.

I do, however, allow someone with Gunnery-3 to dramatically improve the
gunnery software for certain special circumstances.

When I play a battle, the players essentially tell me the tactics they want
to use, and the details are worked out by the machines.  If the gunner is
really god, and tells me that she wants the system optimized for someone
who is going to flip the ship occasionally to use the sensor dish, then, if
they guessed right, they will have a gunnery three program for that special
circumstance, and they have a gunner-3 who knows when to activate that.

Lose the gunner, and they are back to gunner-1, or worse if they run the
special software.

Traveller is pretty golden age, and I rule that most of the progress is
made by mad scientists, but that the usable implementations that the
economy depends on usually require huge research teams.  For example,
AB-101 required, imo, a lot of tinkering if he was as advanced as kernstein
thought.  Before an AB could be sold on the mass market, there would be
dozens and dozens of man years and many, many megacredits of industrial
design and research needed.

That is how I play it.  There are very few people at the top, and it is
likely that any one of them could do what the others did, if that was their
oyster.  Since they usually know the other players, they rarely compete
directly, but do compete fiercely in somewhat similar areas.  Likely few of
Kernstein\'s skill were working on an anthropomorphic robot designed to fool
humans, but there were almost certainly ones working on robot brains, or
long service life systems, or some such.  Likely, the ones working on robot
brains had more life like robots in speech.

In my universe, jump and thrusters are very, very sensitive to gas and
dust, solar wind, and all sorts of other factors.  I try to add at least
one new factor for each new sensor invented by the players, so that they
are always concerned about the performance of their drives.

In general, this means that a competent astrogator and pilot can get the
rated performance out of the ship\'s drives reliably.  If your people are
good, or your drives are in better shape than one would expect, then you
can get much better performance, while the opposite also applies.  It is
very easy in my world to become becalmed, such that your drives are
generating less than a hundredth of their rated thrust.  This gives pirates
plenty of time to act.

As a result, there are approach lanes that a given world is going to
publish.  These are the lanes that it knows the density well enough to keep
the ships running at rated performance.  They publish these lanes in
missives they send to other systems, and a sudden change in the star that
invalidates the lanes is a nightmare for a star port admin. 

Jump is also quirky, in that the better you know the environment, the
better your jumps will work.  Commercial captains tend to be rather
conservative, and to have lousy sensor suites, so they want to have really
good data from the port.  This is expensive to gather, as it is essentially
a full time job for a sensor team, and it is usually a lot cheaper to have
the sensor team using a small sensor close by, thus they prefer to have a
small number of jump points with acceptable tracks to them, and decent
environments for jump.

Anyone with good sensors and a good crew can ignore the published points
fairly easily.  Scouts do this all the time.  So do merchants who need to
go to an unusual destination, or who think they have a flight plan that
will take an hour off their flight time at no additional cost.  Pirates
like people like this.

Again, because my rules allow the ship to be slowed dramatically, the
pirates have a way of grabbing the vessel.  They also have small auxiliary
HEPLAR drives to get out of the zone before a rescue ship can get to the
scene.

Depends on how you want to run the game.  Were it mine, I would run it as
"The noble has always considered the merchant ship "Indefensible" her own
private yacht."  When the Evil Brother boots her out, she essentially told
him that if he tried to take away the Indefensible, she would kill him.  He
believed her.

Her story to the other players may well be that she is happy to be rid of
him, but internally, she may be hoping to make contacts, etc., to get the
control of the house back, despite being younger.

Alternatively, play it as the settlement - she was given a certain fraction
of the house\'s assets in return for waiting the right to take up the title.
 I consider this standard in Noble families, where it is beneficial to have
a dozen possible heirs, but you want all but a small number out of the way
once one of them inherits.  I usually make such sign-offs conditional on
the third child, or the first to reach majority, so those kids have a risky
life...

Everyone expected her to take the yacht, or shares in the family business,
or ownership of one of the many manor houses and assets to support her
comfortably, but she, instead, took ownership of the newest, spiffiest ship
in the yards.  This has Elder Brother a bit annoyed.  Perhaps it was a
prototype in some way, or has something special about it that he wants
back.  She might even know that...

Do you know the names of the companies that sell these?  Last time I looked 
in earnest (1992) I could not find anyone who would claim that their system 
was "provably correct" (at the time I was working for a guy who acted as one 
of the advisors for British Standards in the area of high-reliability safety 
and control systems).

The best system we found was following a new (in 1992) German standard, I 
forget the initials for the standard, but the manufacturer of the system was 
P&F (Pepperel & Fuchs, I think).  They claimed some very high reliability 
for their hardware + software, but could not guarantee (only make 
"educated guesses" about) the accuracy of the signals coming from the 
instruments in the field.  These systems are, I believe, used in civilian 
nuclear installations and on offshore platforms.


The company I work for was involved in the BNFL thermal oxide re-processing 
plant design, and I\'m sure we could not find "provably correct" control 
systems for that plant.  The system uses multiple redundancy to give tiny 
failure chances (1 incident per 100,000 years was the overall system target 
I recall BNFL stating in the public equiry (secrecy forbids me telling you 
the real number ... which fortunately I don\'t know :-)

Also, I can jump \'closer\', but the risk of failure is increased, correct?

I made a mistake on an earlier post the CSC Far Orbit sensor has task of
Formidable to to locate a target at Far Orbital range and Impossible+1 to
detect anything at RF 12 Interplanetary. So the listed range is not the
maximum range.

Well I would like see some implementation fo gravitic and nuclear sensors
despite the impracticallities. It fits more into my type of Traveller.

By the way how do you shield for neutrinos?

Well the above might have worked it FFS2 had not changed the sensor values
from FFS1.

Example a Far Orbital CSC sensor has power input of 10Mw, an area of
1000m2, a cost of 7Mcr, and a volume of .25m3 at TL 15.
 
The closest FFS2 PEMS sensor would be a area of 500m2, a volume of 500m3,
power of  500kw or .5Mw, cost of 2500Mcr, and a sensitivity or 14.5. 

Comparsion
             CSC      FFS2
Area m2      1000     500
Volume m3    0.25     500
Power Mw     10       0.5
Cost Mcr     7        2500
Sensitivity  13(26)   14.5(29)    

I much prefer the staging up from the Vehicle passive sensors in FFS2, even
though the table 205 does not give the area of the antenna or the power usage.

By the way what does the resulution at 50,000km scale to ie .07m2 or what,
and what does the * mean by the last two .07* in that column?

I am going to be doubling the sensitivity values as per George\'s suggestion.

It is because you are not holding the rifle barrel completely flat.
A bullet follows a ballistic path, always, period. ANY projectile that
does NOT carry an additional propulsion source follows a ballistic path,
be it a bullet, a gauss round, or a 155mm shell.
It may be very flat, it may be pronounced.  Because of this fact sights on
rifles are designed to take this into account. Attach a level to your
rifle sometime, make sure it is entirely level, and then determine where
your aim point is. It should, if the rifle is accurately sighted in, be
aimed at a point _below_ the rifle barrel. Note, with high power rifles,
this will be  quite hard to determine, because a high speed projectile has
a pronouncedly flath path.

Go look it up, any physics text will show the principles, it\'s a classic
 problem that is covered in Newtonian physics.

 Nope the "official" system is metric. Just that most \'mericans loudly

Hmm maybe I am being alittle dense today, but I thought the sensitivity

I must disagree. You\'re right in saying that Rhylanor _can_ easily 
afford to put a gazillion patrol ships in adjacent systems to reduce
piracy.

Why would they? Traveller\'s economic system has a very capitalistic feel 
to it, IMO. Governments aren\'t relied upon to support businesses.
Rather, it is up to the business to ensure that they can make a profit 
on their own. This means that each trading company must weigh the risks 
involved with shipping freight/passengers, and equip their ships 
sufficiently to deal with those risks.

In the Imperium, most of the freight and passengers are hauled by the 
large corporations, not by the individually-owned traders. The large 
corporations will handle their own security, usually by arming/armoring 
their vessels enough that pirates will think twice before attacking 
them. 

This leaves the little ships as targets.

So Rhylanor wouldn\'t bother sending ships to adjacent systems. They\'d
have the attitude of "if the merchants want to sell us their stuff,
they\'ll deal with any and all problems themselves". Of course, the
shipping companies simply transfer the cost of taking precautions to
the consumer anyway but that\'s not the government\'s problem.

That\'s part of the reason it\'s so tough being a small freighter.
You must cough up cash you don\'t have to arm your ship. Then, to 
cover those costs, you must buy speculative cargo, since freight doesn\'t
pay well (because those pesky large shipping companies keep the freight
rate down). Then, to top it all off, some pirate picks on you and
steals that same cargo.

Life as an independent merchantman is tough!

successful.  Let me pass on some of the things that I did, and you can
decided if they should have worked or not.

Class A, B, and C starports are your friends.  Ships advertise for
cargo and passengers (including destination world and schedule).  This
makes it easy to decide whether to take them in-system or precede them to
the destination world and wait for them to arrive.  Generally, the arrival
point is much easier to predict than the departure point.

It\'s generally pretty easy to find out what the most valuable cargo is
available, and where it is destined to go, just by posing as a trader and
contacting brokers.  Then, just follow the money!  Making friends with the
clerks at the starport is good.  Remember, starports sell pre-generated
flight plans that give you all the information you need to pick up your
target at either the jump-point or the breakout point.  Clerks are
relatively low paid too...  Even if the targt does not buy a pre-generated
jump play, chances are pretty good that it will file a courtesy flight
plan (or may be required to) that, if you can get a copy, will give you a
lot of the information you need for a successful ambush.

If you can beat a ship to the break out point, you have time to check for
System defense and piracy supression ships.  If you can position yourself
right, you may be able to catch the target before it gets good system
information from it\'s sensors.

Ships are the most valuble commodity, true, but the hardest to dispose of.
Remember, the PASSENGERS can be valuble.  The passengers carry valubles.
The cargo can be extremely valuble.  The captain will be carrying
(usually) a great deal of portable, and easily liquidated, wealth (ships
payment, ship\'s funds, crew salaries, etc...)  Also, the mail may contain
a fair amount of wealth too...  (bearer bonds, transaction notices,
information...)

Many ships will be willing to part with their cargo (ie. dump it) if it
will prevent a boarding or as part of a negotiated cease fire.  This can
save a _lot_ of time.

Jump ships are nice, but the INTRA-system cargo and passenger shuttles
ususally a heck of a lot easier to take, less guarded, and carry much the
same cargo.

Keep a jump plot running and don\'t hesitate to run.  It\'s generally easier
to explain to your crew why you ran from a fight, than it is to explain to
the magistrate why you started it...

Hi Garth... I didn\'t take the Vista from any particular book but
was rather using high guard (classic book 5) rules along with some
liberal interpretations of what a minimized crew could accomplish...
The ship does not conform to QSDS or Brilliant Lances or any other
Traveller ship construction system except for high guard (what can
i say... i\'m an old fuddy-duddy).

Design Philosophy:

It became apparent in the early years of the 2nd Civil War
that the battles were being won or lost on the strength of
the carrier fleets. Hence, carriers became the targets of
the war, and capital ships shifted their emphasis from
planetary bombardment to carrier assault.

In a mad rush to counteract this development, the Emperor
commissioned ten-thousand Vista Class Tenders as a means
of breaking up the carrier/capital ship conflict and
overwhelming the enemy by sheer numbers. The move proved
remarkably successful.

During past battles, fighters had a strong vested interest
in protecting their carrier (without it, they would never get
back home). Hence, carriers would tend to enter realspace
at a relatively distant (safe) range from the target, losing
all possibility for surprise, and only a portion of the
squadron would be committed, reducing the overall offensive
capacity of the vessel.

The tactics of the Vista Tenders were very different. Because
several hundred could jump simultaneously, the loss of any
one, or even several, was relatively minor, and because they
were much smaller than the carriers, they were much less
vulnerable, as a whole, to the big weapons of the capital
ships. All in all, the disemination of carrying capacity among
a variety of small tenders meant that greater risks could be
taken, and this in turn changed the way the entire war was
fought.

Added to this was the fact that tankers could drop supplies of
hydrogen in the deep of space, allowing the fleets to take
advantage of their powerful engines coupled with their strangely
low fuel capacity (which made the ships far cheaper than they
otherwise would have been). Hence, for a surprisingly low cost,
the Emperor weilded a very fast, very effective tool which could
leapfrog opponents, shed damage more easily than any of the big
ships ever could, and effectively stomp the interstellar battle-
field.

After the war, many of the battlescared Vistas were retired and
sold into private hands or refurbished by the scout service.
They proved surprising effective in survey operations along the
frontier. Unlike the usual 100-ton scout, the Vistas were much
more battle-worthy (having been bred for war), and the fighter
complement (which was completely optional) allowed them to more
effectively scout situations where a possible threat was posed
by the locals. Further, their ability to leapfrog long distances
allowed them to scout systems which were too difficult to reach
otherwise. Often, particularly on long-distance scouting
missions, instead of carrying two fighters, they will carry a
load of highly-enriched fuel which they will deposit en route
for the final return jump.

Technical Specifications:

Hull: 136.5 tons standard (wedge-shaped)
      186.5 tons fully loaded (dispersed structure)
Range: 1 parsec fully loaded, 2 parsecs unloaded,
   6 parsecs with sufficient drop tanks
Ship\'s Boats: Two 24-ton short-range fighters
Defenses: None
Offenses: One triple laser turret on dorsal (top) surface
   Note: Cannot be repaired from inside the ship.
Maneuver: Capable of 6G maneuver, streamlined, with
   two five-ton back legs and gravitic pressors along
   ventral (lower) surface. Capable of hovering in
   landing orientation in up to three gravities.
Crew: Four
   1 pilot/navigator
   1 engineer
   2 fighter pilots (to double in 2ndary roles)
Additional Features: Onboard scoops and fuel purification

Correct, as long as you\'re not within 100 diameters of ANY major
planetary mass. So, if you\'re moving away from a gas giant\'s moon,
you should be 100 gas giant diameters away before you jump in addition
to 100 moon diameters away.

Yes. The actual consequences of "failure" depend upon which Traveller

You end up 100 diameters away from the primary star, in my universe,
since the star is the largest body in the system. Also, you\'re generally
at a tangent to the ecliptic plane, in my universe, since that\'s 
generally the safest spot to emerge from jumpspace.

In my world, and only if a player asks, I randomly pick one of the
two possible points matching my criteria. It really doesn\'t matter
as far as travel times goes.

This has limited use, though. After a few decades of this tactic,
only well-armed kick-butt ships would respond to distress calls.
Lesser ships would suddenly (wink wink) have sensor difficulties
preventing them from detecting the SOS.

Sit down and figure out how *long* it takes to get from the gas giant
to the mainworld. You\'ll find that if you consider the number of cargo
trips per year you can make, refuelling at gas gaints *loses* money,
because you can\'t make as many trips per year!

Sure. But my point was that the Kilogram is not a unit that can be
reproduced in the lab. Instead you have to rely on the ability to trace
your set of weights to the standard set.

But the meter, second, coulumb, etc *can* be reproduced in the lab.
Thus if somebody dropped a Big Rock(tm) on Paris, measurements of time
and distance wouldn\'t be affected. But we\'d have a real mess with
regards to high precision mass measurements.

Correct.

You could concievably jump from the hanger on the ground.  The risk is high
inside 100d, and much higher in side 10d.

If you have charts for the destination system, you pick the point you wish
to arrive at.  TNE had a useful little table for detrmining how exact your
emergence was, and how much fuel you needed to burn to get back on course.

Unless something goes wrong, you\'ll be 100 diameters from your target world.

If you don\'t have charts, you just have to jump blind.  A competant Scout
team can usually figure where the habital zone for the star is, and place
you in that region.

>A Jump Primer would be helpful, because Traveller is the only place where

1981 NFC Championship game, 49ers vs. Cowboys. 4th quarter, Montana to
Clark.  The Catch.  That white man did jump, and we love him for it!

Oohh.. I\'m a solid type 6.5  It seems that the Bohemians tend to be the

But the vast number of character occupations, along with the ability to
import from T2K and DC, made up for some of the problems.. I never ran TNE,
just played it, so I can\'t speak from a Ref\'s perspective on this one.  TNE
also gave the best space combat system for Traveller, Brillant Lances.

I\'d include Pocket Empires, Psionics Institutes, and the BITS version of
Long Way Home on the great items list.

The quality is improving slowly.. speaking as a writer, it\'s very hard to
produce workable, good material under the time constraints we\'re given.
I\'d rant about my current situation, but that would be bad...

Agreed, from everything we\'ve seen, T4.1 is going to be what we hoped for

a letter of marque and could claim to be waging commerce warfare for his
country, and the out-and-out pirate who just robbed everyone at will.
	
Perhaps the deciding factor was simply - who caught you?

Jump: I reckon the Astrogator earns his money. Unless the ship is running a
preprogrammed course card bought from the Port Authority, the Astrogator is
responsible for finding a safe point to jump from, giving the pilot
instructions so that the ship comes out with the right residual momentum at
the far end, setting up a course that doesn\'t go through a star or planet,
checking sensors to see that there\'s no gravity well close enough to cause
problems - like an uncharted nickel-iron asteroid with just enough G to
cause a misjump - they\'re easy enough to detect with powerful active
sensors, but I reckon you could miss one if you weren\'t careful. Then the
Astrogator talks to the Engineers about Jump fields and suchlike, goes off
to his stateroom and has a quiet breakdown. A week later he has to confirm
position, hopefully he DOESN\'T have to figure out where the ship has ended
up but it\'s possible. He has to check and confirm mainworld course and
remain alert to recalculate courses if deviations are required. He\'ll
constantly (with computer assistance) be rechecking the course to make the
fastest run/best use of fuel etc.

Many of us neglect Jumpspace - we focus on doing stuff on the planet, maybe
a little about the trip to 100 diameters, but actually you can do a lot
with that 168 hours. What does everyone do during that week? Spending a
little time on this is not only a great opportunity for some roleplaying,
but also serves to throw players off the scent when you do something to
them in Jspace. They may be wary the first time you ask, \'what\'s everyone
doing on Tuesday then?\' 

And there are many things one can do in Jspace. Apart from the obvious
\'Murder On The Rhylanor Express\' idea, that is.

... live cargo that gets loose - can be comic or lethal.... Ten minutes to
J-emergence and the chief engineer is drunk/in the bath/having another
psychotic episode and locked himself in the Gig.... Wierd Jspace effects as
a result of misjump.... Coming out of jump into a dust cloud or nebula.
Sirens, alerts, panic. 

I\'ve always taken Jspace as a non-place. Nobody understands it, though a
few people have good theories. (That neatly handwaves the gravitic
interference problem aside). I once decided that all Jspace was the SAME
non-place, so everything that had ever been in Jspace was in there all at
once, always. Thus you can have strange effects like stray messages or the
time three Rule Of Man crewmen from the Solomani cruiser Navarino - lost in
a misjump a thousand years an more ago - walked out of thin air into the
gunroom of the frigate Saberwolf. Upon inspection, it was found that the
Wolf (built during the Hard Times with ancient salvaged parts many times
recycled) had been built with some parts from the wreck of the Navarino.

You can do wierd stuff like that once in a while. It makes a change from
meeting that riotous mob and those fugitives the encounter tabel keeps
throwing up. How come there\'s no \'man walking dog\', \'postman\', \'old lady
doing the shopping\' encounters? 

I mean, why do I always run into those Marines with their ATV in the Post
Office?

	imho male in the aslan society perhaps think to have power,

Cr60000 per month por part thereof per platoon. Since the payroll of a fifty

There is a great set of rules for writing computer programs in BJTAS#1. 
These expand on the basic rules in the Traveller Book.

It\'s a coincidence, but we actually had a character in our game last
night who wanted to try his hand writing Auto/Evade.

It\'s 14 weeks down the line, and he still hasn\'t done it.

The BTJAS#1 rules are good.  One of the things I like is, at the end,
after you\'ve written the program, you roll to see what size the program
is (We\'re using the old CT RAM and High Memory type rules for computers
from the Traveller Book).

The roll is 1D-computer skill.  This guy is a computer-2, so even if he
writes the damn thing (it\'s now 3.5 months since he started), it can
turn out to be too big for the ship\'s computer!

I like these rules.  I\'ve tweaked them a little, of course, but it makes
writing computer programs for a living not very viable.

That\'s left to the big megacorporations with all the high tech gizmos.

You should check out these rules if you want to add programming to your
campaign.

In my campaign, yes.  The Office of Calendar Compliance goes at stuff like

 You can\'t just have people running around with different measurements when

The copy I received direct from IG had scuffing at the ends of the spine -
due to rubbing of the cover against the packing material, I\'d guess... The
shiny finish on the book is very fragile and I don\'t think the book (in its

Yep. Though Marc is proposing that your course can\'t come within 100
diameters of any body, or you\'ll pop out of jump there (after the
normal period of time).

Yep.

Good question. And one *never* covered in the rules. <sigh>

> Do I randomly pick a distance and heading?

Not likely. That\'d have you having a good chance of coming out *way*
too far from the planet.

> Is is the same coordinates in the next system as where I left?

Since co-ordinate systems are pretty arbitary, this is unlikely also.

It\'s been pretty much assumed that you can pick your exit point. But
how closely you can "call" it is unknown.

Also, it\'s unclear whether your exit point is "fixed" or relative to
the planet. I like "fixed", because that means that the variation in
jump duration *causes* a variance in exit point relative to the
destination. A planet moving in orbit at 30 km/sec will have move
108,000 km in one hour. So if your jump was off by an hour, your
position would be off by *at least* that much. 

There\'s also some argument about how your momentum is conserved. Some
say you come out with the same velocity relative to your destination as
you had relative to your starting point. I prefer real conservation,
which means that you exit with the same velocity and direction relative
to your starting point. Which means that you have to worry about
relative velocity of the stars, and orbital velocities of the planet
you left from and the one you started from. 

I like that because it means that you\'d be better off running out in a
specific direction (to build up a velocity in that direction) before
jumping. You\'d do that to minimize the velocity difference between you
and your destination.

This means that folks heading for a specific destination would *tend*
to head for a specific *part* of the 100 diameter limit. That makes
piracy a bit easier, and also makes it easier to guess about ship\'s
movements. 

Of course, if you are willing to waste some fuel, you can jump with the
"wrong" vector and correct it after jumping. So you can mislead folks
about where you are headed.

Actually, the metric system has been legal in the US almost since it
was invented (Franklin talked Congress into passing a law legalizing
it). It\'s never been *mandatory*. 

Bacl in the 70s there was a push to make it mandatory. Didn\'t go over
very well. But we\'ll convert sooner or later. But it\'ll be painful when
it happens. Because the only really practical way is to effectively
"outlaw" the old system. It\'s been demonstrated again and again that
trying things like highway signs using both systems *doesn\'t* help
people learn metric. They\'ll keep using the old units as long as they
are available.

Check back issues of RISKS-Digest (comp.risks). I know that they\'ve
been mentioned. But I don\'t recall any names. And as I recall, they
tend to be RISC chips, and a few generations "behind" due to the extra
overhead.

I think that one of the outfits mentioned was British.

I write a lot of little short stories for my group.  Sometimes I\'ll 
"novelize" an event that happened in our game, and sometimes I\'ll 
write a short "off camera" tale for the players to read in between 
games.

Most of the time, these stories are so specific to our game that I 
don\'t see outsiders getting much use out them.  It\'s not in context 
for those who don\'t know the intricacies of our game.

But, sometimes, I write one that others can relate to and enjoy.  
This is one of those.

It\'s a quickie, and I\'ll set you up.   We\'re playing the Traveller 
Adventure.  My characters are on Pysadi, and one of them has been 
placed in jail for kicking at one of the anolas.

He\'s been sentenced to one year.  The March Harrier and crew are 
in the starport.  Their ship\'s software has been deleted, and all of 
the equipment aboard the ship stolen--but that\'s another story.

The point is, the ship is stuck in the starport with no way to get 
off.  They are waiting for the insurance money to come to them from 
Oberlindes.  Two of the ship\'s crew, the Captain and one of the 
gunners, has traveled back to Aramis, trying to hook up aid from a 
certain Eneri Gillaan, who\'s supposed to be in Naval 
Intelligence--but that\'s another story too.

The others are on Pysadi waiting.  Because of the events that got Gyr 
placed in jail for a year, they are forbidden to leave the starport.  
The Pysadian officials want them off the planet as soon as possilble.

Unfortunately, as soon as possible is not coming that quickly, and 
the ship has been stranded there for 4 standard months.

We cut to Gyr, in the town jail in Itzeny for all that time now.  The 
anolas are with him, having become "attracted" to him--which is why 
he was trying to shoo them away in the first place.

This is an off camera story for my group.  We just played yesterday 
night.  We play again the Sunday after next.

I\'m writing this to let Gyr\'s player know what he is thinking all 
this time.  Also, my players don\'t realize that there is a difference 
between standard time and local time.

This story is meant to open their eyes.

Also, if you are familiar with the Traveller Adventure, you\'ll know 
about the negative effect prolonged exposure to the anolas have on 
humans.  My players don\'t know about this yet, and I am hinting 
towards it, ever so slightly, in the end of the story.

They\'ll just think I was trying to be funny.

Also, last game session, they were wondering why, in four months, the 
Pysadians hadn\'t moved the prisoner to the bigger prison instellation 
in Sadi, the planet\'s captial.  

One of the players figured it out though.  It\'s because the anolas 
are interested in the prisioner.  I am secretly rolling behind the 
scenes to see if they stay interested, or will wander off at some 
point.

When thay wander off, I\'ll move Gyr to the prison facility in the 
city, and the players will have a tougher time of freeing him.

So, they realized last night that they are on borrowed time.  Sooner 
or later, my roll will come through, and I\'ll move him.  If they move 
to free him before this roll occurrs, they\'ll be in better shape to 
get him.  If they don\'t, they\'ll have the prison facility to break 
into instead of the three story church in Itzeny.

But, they\'ve got to be able to get off planet after the breakout.  
So, its pins and needles for them.

See, I didn\'t tell them that they were right last night...about the 
anolas.  I let them think what they want, right or wrong.  But, I am 
kinda confirming their thoughts in this story.

It\'s my suttle way of telling them that they are right.

Without further ado, he\'s "Pysadian Jail".

================================================================



                                         Pysadian Jail

                                      by Kenneth D. Bearden



Gyr looked up from his Pysadian readings one day (he\'s read just about
all of  them), and said to himself, "Great Mother!  It\'s been over
four months since I\'ve heard from anyone on the ship."

But, he doesn\'t fret long, because he knows that his friend, Frank,
would not leave him.  They must be having trouble getting the supplies
they need to get the ship moving.  Besides, Daeus and Gvoudzon had let
him know that Councelor Momi had restricted their access to Pysadi to
all but the starport.

They are all probably holed up there, just as much a prisoner as he
was.  Except, of course, their cell was a bit bigger than his--they\'ve
got the whole starport to run around in.

Then, a thought occurred to Gyr.  What if something has happened to
Frank and the Captain on Aramis?  What if Eneri wasn\'t too happy about
them coming to see him?

If something had happened, they could be trying to locate another
engineer.  They couldn\'t take off without one...

Nooo, Gyr thought.  He must push that thought out of his mind.  
Nothing had happened to his best friend.  The others might leave him,
but Frank would never.

Gyr decided that the was just going to have to sit here and bide his
time.  Frank would come for him soon enough.  They had probably worked
somthing out with Eneri, got a brick of cash, and were waiting on a
shit load of weapons before they came to break him out.

If he stayed right here, they\'d have a damn good shot at it.  Hell,
even if they didn\'t have any weapons, they could probably break him
out.  The Pysadians rarely carried weapons anyway.

He had wondered why they hadn\'t moved him yet.  At first, he thought
it was because Councilor Momi didn\'t want him moved with the crew
still on planet.  Gyr had speculated that Momi didn\'t want to take the
risk and he was probably waiting for the Harrier to lift off.

Gyr had heard from the guards that the prison in Sadi was a pretty
tight facility, even by TL 4 standards.  He wished the crew would
hurry up and do something while the picking was good.  Breaking him
out of this building would be like a hot knife cutting through butter.
 But, if they waited until he was transfered to Sadi, it sounds like
it would be a whole lot harder.

He thought that if they started to move him, and he hadn\'t heard from
the crew, then he would try a break on his own.  It was finally spring
now, and he didn\'t have to contend with the freezing temperatures. 
He\'d try to make it to the starport and see what\'s up. 
 Maybe he could get Bill to help him.

But, then, another thought hit him.  They were pretty up on these
anolas here.  The little critters came when they wanted.  They left 
when they wanted, and, basically, they just about did anything they 
wanted to.

The things had taken somewhat of a liking to Gyr.  It was not as much 
or as loving as it was towards Glynn, but the Pysadians definitely 
caught on to it.

Gyr started to think.  This must be why they hadn\'t  moved him 
yet. Yes, it was now clear from the things he had read from the 
Pysadian religious writings.  He was sure that the reason he hadn\'t 
been moved was because of the anolas.

As long as they were around him, he would stay right here.  If they
lost interest in him, he would surely be moved to the facility in
Sadi.

Somthing scuffed the outside of Gyr\'s door right then.  It was one of
the guards  taking the wax out of the key hole.  Then the metal 
clinck made by the key turning the lock snapped, and Gori, one of the 
6 Salvors here in Itzeny, stepped in with Gyr\'s mid-morning snack.

They fed him very well here.

"Ahhh.  Good morning Mr. Gyr!"

"Yes, good morning Mr. Gori.  Blessed be Mother Pysadi!"

"Ahhh, yes, Mr. Gyr, blessed be indeed."  Gori sat Sandy\'s brunch down
on one of the locker cabinets in the room.  It was delicious looking,
as usual, and today it was what Gyr called "trake cocktail" with
babaloa juice.  Sandy had tried the sky melon and found it somewhat
strong.  He told Gori about it, and sure enough, his "trake cocktail"
was now missing the sky melon pieces that it used to be made with.

"Gori, I am so glad that I have had an opportunity to read these
scriptures."  Gyr said, holding up his copy of the Pysadian Petra,
their holy book.

"I might say, if I may, Mr. Gyr,"  Gori responded, "that indeed you
are blessed."  Motioning to the anolas picking at Gyr\'s food (which
Gyr had learned to let them do and eat after them), he continued, "The
children of Pysadi are never wrong in discovering a good heart."

"I cannot wait,"  Sandy took the opportunity to probe, try and find
out information (he did this periodically), "until the Great Mother
smiles down on me, opens the gates, and let\'s me wonder at the lands
of holy Pysadi.  I cannot wait for the next 8 months to pass."

Gori smiled, but he realized his friend--brother if you will, did not
understand.  "Mr. Gyr.  You are an offworlder.  You have been
sentenced to one year."

"Yes, I understand!"  Gyr\'s eyebrows arched up.  "And, it is the best
experience of my life.  Sometimes we offworlders do not stop in our
frantic lives to acknowledge the really important things.  If
I had not be sentenced, surely my eyes would not have been opened!"

Gori\'s head shook.  "Yes.  Dis is true, Mr. Gyr.  You are truly 
blessed, and Pysadi\'s children have shown you the way."

Gyr agreed.  "Had it not been for the sacred children--you are right. 
 I believe that it was their plan.  They showed me, and blessed 
Glynn, but I refused to see.  So, they made it so I would be forced to
see, and I will be forever in their debt."

"As are we all, Mr. Gyr.  But, I fear you do not understand what I
have said."

Gyr feigned over curiosity--he couldn\'t wait to get off this fucking
planet.  He\'d had enough of this \'blessed be\' shit. 
"Please...explain, brother."

"Yes, I will."  Gori held up one stiff finger in the air as he spoke. 
 "Living, as you did in space, you are used to the Imperial standard
time--the standard hour, the standard day, the standard week, no?"

Oh shit.  Gyr knew where this was going.  He was kicking himself for
not realizing it four months ago.  "This is true, brother Gori."

"...and, the standard year, Mr. Gyr,"  Gori finished.  "But, you are
know a child of Pysadi.  You are sentenced to serve out one of Mother
Pysadi\'s years."

Gyr mustered all of the happy emotion he could find.  There was none
left, not even in his big toe.  "As it should be, Gori.  All the
better for me."

"Ahh, Dis is so."  Gori bowed, with his fingers locked together,
"Blessed be Mother Pysadi, Mr. Gyr."

Gyr bowed in return, "Yes, Mr. Gori, blessed be."

The door closed behind Gori, and Gyr waited for the metallic clink of
the key and the replacing of the wax.  He looked over at his food,
which the anolas had just about devoured.  With the rest of it, they
were throwing at the far wall, making colorful splatters, and they
watched curiously as the fruit stuck for a moment, then plopped to the
floor.

It was all safe, and Gyr moved to one of the beds across the room.  He
slid it out to look at the scratches he had made on the wall.  Then he
dug underneath the mattress for the pice of cobble stone that he had
unearthed from the floor under one of the locker cabinets.  Taking the
sharpened stone, he scribbled through the sticks he\'d been drawing on
the wall to keep track of time, effectively making them unreadable.  

Frustrated, he used the wall to do some quick calculations.  
Damn.  He wished he would of thought of this before.

The Pysadian year is 2.69 standard years long.  He had served four
standard months, alright, but it wasn\'t near one third of his one year
sentence.  

The Pysadian year is just under 33 standard months long!

He had only served less than 10% of his sentence, and he had 29 
months to go!

Shit!  He sat back on the bed he had pulled out and held his face in
his hands.  He rubbed his temples because he just noticed that he had
a headache.

As a matter of fact, he was getting a lot of headaches lately.  He
sure wished to hell that the crew would get their act together and get
their asses down here to rescue him.

Gyr looked up at the wall as another piece of fruit zoomed by his head
and stuck to the wall.

He didn\'t know how much longer he was going to be able to take this.

Interestingly enough, as someone who was brought up under the old Imperial
system (and Pounds/Shillings/Pence ... 1 = 20 = 240, rather than Dollars),
graduating from High School in 1972, we had rather a schizo education -- until
almost the end of Primary School we learnt all sums in Pounds/Shillings/Pence,
even tho we changed to Decimal currency in 1966! Similarly, tho for *Science* at
High School we used the MKS system, in *Maths* we used Imperial measures more
often than not (in fact, IIRC, pretty much all the time when "real world"
problems were being looked at).

Even better, as a Teacher (History & English) at High School (Years 7-12) level,
I\'ve noted that, while children don\'t have a clue about the old Sterling
currency, they *do* seem to be intimately familiar with some aspects of the old
Imperial system of measurement. Its literally a case of being able to ask a kid
what their height is and all you can get is Feet/Inches ... they simply do not
know what it is in meters/centimeters unless they work it out (and many don\'t
know the conversion factors!) ... and this is regardless of academic ability!

For example, I\'ve noted over the last 20 years since I started teaching that
virtually none of my pupils actually writes about their height or weight (or the
height or weight of others) in anything other than Feet/Inches and Stone/Pounds!
This is despite the fact that the metric system has been "official" for about
the same period. Sure, they think in kilometers for distance (but most still
understand, and occasionally use, miles) and in kilograms for weights other than
their own.

The only explanation I can think of is that their *parents* are mostly of a
generation to have been brought up in the Imperial system, and they still think
of things in that way for *personal* measurement.

Personally, I never saw any problem with having a dual system - MKS for the
scientific and engineering types who really wanted it; Imperial for the rest of
us. After all, the conversion factors were known and (with hindsight) working it
into computer programs would not have been a real problem.

And, of course, there\'s the "problem" of the extra-Imperial States. The Zhos,
Aslan, Hivers, K\'kree, Julian Protectorate and even the Solomani are unlikely to
use 3I measurements.

I did an article on it in "Dark Star #1" ... looking at the problem of
"Equipment Incompatibility" (and, amongst other things, why Virus simply
wouldn\'t have worked very well outside the Imperium). Anyone interested, I can
provide copies of DS#1 in .pdf format for modest cost and, though strictly
speaking "out of print" (it\'s only photocopied from a master), I could even run
off extra copies if there was enough demand.

Contact me for details (and, yes, there will now likely be a DS#3 ... and more
thereafter, intermittently ... but only for GURPS Traveller).

I always thought that Mega Traveller had the most errata because that
was the time when the editors were trying hardest to fix all the
errors.  Unlike certain versions of certain games where the publisher
does not print or list the errata or even trys to pretend that something
is not an error "No that\'s not a bug, that is a feature - of course all
the law levels are the same as the government types in First Survey."

You mean there are Traveller fans who do _not_ consider the Third

Probably nothing at all as a radially symmetrical body moving along its
axis produces no lift and even if it did have its nose offset from the line
of movement the spin would make the lift cancel (it would lift equally in
all angular directions which cancels out).

My players have a standard subsidized merchant with no armor.  They

Can they just pull into a graving dock and have armor put on the

Can I just do the two or three calculations for cost in the SSDS 
rules to figure out how much to charge them?

Are there any limits to putting armor on? 

 I noticed that armor is not handled like it was in High Guard where 
your armor factor cannot be larget than the ship\'s TL.  And, I 
noticed that some ships have some incredibly high armor values--like 
60.  It seems these ships will keep on coming no matter what you 
throw at them.

Do I have to figure anything else in when I\'m retrofitting a ship

But that won\'t work if there are patrol ships in the vincinity, because it

For the same reason Coast Guard ships go out to help ships in distress. The
ship is there anyway, so you may as well get some use out of it.

Surely one of the prime functions of a government is to protect its citizens.
Protecting their trade is not far behind.

>So Rhylanor wouldn\'t bother sending ships to adjacent systems. 

Propably not, but that\'s because they pay 30% of their naval budget to the
Imperium, who will patrol the systems instead. Even so, Rhylanor will have
patrol ships of their own just in case the Imperial ships are sent elsewhere
in a crisis. We know that Rhylanor spends a lot on its system defense forces.
If as little as 1/1000th of it is spent on patrol ships, Rhylanor will have
several 100 of them. They have to pay for them no matter what, so why not
protect their trade? Anything else would be dumb.

If you have a bank loan, you were able to persuade a very sceptical bank
manager that you would be able to keep up payments for the next 40 years.
If your business plan includes running risks, then the financing plan
would include armaments.

If you don\'t have a bank loan, you can undercut any ship that does (until
and unless you have a major breakdown, in which case you go bankrupt).

All that says is that your Referee believed that piracy was a viable
career. It dosen\'t prove that he was right.

Some of the points you make are quite good, but they are all moot when the
authorities have as many ships as they do and as few places to guard as 
they do.

Well, I\'m not familiar with SSDS, but I\'ll throw in my two bits 
anyway.

In My Universe (standard disclaimer) armor is not an add-on to the
hull. It IS the hull. Since there are so many things built in to the
hull material, like pipes, sensor arrays, conduits and even windows
(on some ships, like the Far Trader), it is impractical to simply
nail on a few more degrees of armor.

To retrofit armor to a ship is extremely expensive, since the shipyard
must remove the entire exterior hull and then install a new one.
I\'d rule that it would take double or triple the hull price, plus
months (depending upon ship size) for installation.

Good point. I hadn\'t considered that. But it won\'t be enough. If piracy is
a concern, merchant ships will be assigned arrival and departure slots that
will keep them far enough from each other for a patrol ship to intercept 
anyone who deviated from his assigned slot.

Which would be about 12 ships if you really wanted to cover the entire
sphere. But there would be no need for that. Just an arrival area and
a departure area.

Oh sure. There are plenty of worlds in the Traveller Universe that can\'t
afford even one ship. But there are a number of worlds that can afford
hundreds of ships to take up the slack.

>(Especially if you want to take ships and group them into fleets for 
>military purposes).

Oh, so far I have only calculated with about 1/1000th of the naval budget
going to piracy suppression. If you assume that the rest of the fleet 
will protect the big worlds, you can use all those patrol ships to cover
the worlds without ships of their own.

Perhaps you should start having other free traders that don\'t refuel at
Gas Giants undercut them. If they can make a profit even with the loss of
time from wilderness refuelling then someone that dosen\'t can make a
profit with lesser charges.

loop, really. Most starports won\'t be able to sell refined fuel at Cr500/T,
because that means it is cheaper for a freighter to carry a fuel
purification plant and lose the revenue for the space the plant takes
up. So refined fuel _won\'t_ cost Cr500/T. I did some calculations a
while back and found that if refined fuel costs more than Cr290/T then
a freighter is better off with a fuel purifier (This assumes the freighter
can pick up and deliver freight equal to 90% of his cargo space on each 
and every jump). The figures I used had several minor flaws and I haven\'t
redone them yet, so I won\'t vouch for it, but IMO you won\'t go far
wrong if you let your starports sell refined fuel at Cr250-300/T. Btw.
if the purifier runs full time and you can sell all that you refine, the
cost of refining fuel can be as low as Cr5/T. So everything more than
Cr105/T could be pure profit...

Easy! Applique Armour. Weld plates on the outside. Only problem is weight
and the fact that it will never be as good as original armour (which has the
properly designed interior structure supporting it) and doesn\'t have gaps
(well, large ones anyway)

I would say, as an off the cuff rule, applique costs double, takes up 50%
greater volume (from required internal braces) and has no effect if a roll
of 2D6 is 9+. For each doubling of cost, and extra 25% increase in armour
volume, reduce this number by 1. So to have a really good AV, you have to
pay 32 times the value, and the armour takes up 275% volume

While I might argue that many traders do not have the acumen to take a
present loss over future gains, those traders are likely not going to have
the money for good things to steal.  Or at least, not for long.

Given that we have been talking about 100d far ports anyway, why not set
one up near the gas giant?  The station owners can schlep cargoes through
normal space to get to the gas giant station, and then trade them with the
incoming merchants.  There would be a time lag, so a timely cargo would not
be there, but one that is plentiful in the system would probably be sitting
in warehouses, waiting to be picked up.

One point - in my universe, at least, worlds fear attack, which is why even
a settled world has a deep meson site.  If you are going to go to the
expense of placing a deep meson site, then you would certainly be wary
about placing a port at the 100d limit, as then people can just jump in and
take it.

In order to have this happen, I have ruled that the Imperium has had many
fractious periods, and that somehow "pirates" can get ahold of full
Imperial squadrons occasionally.  It does not happen often, but it happens
often enough to keep the appropriations committee funding the word defenses.

But Coast Guard ships don\'t go into foreign waters to do this. Remember,
we\'re talking about Rhylanor sending its patrol vessels into 
_adjacent_ systems. Sure, Rhlanor\'ll have ships in its own system.

Protecting the trade of other systems does not fall within the
jurisdiction of a government.

I doubt the Imperial Navy would get involved if a free trader got
hijacked by pirates. Now, if that free trader had, for a passenger,
the son of the second cousin of Duke Norris, well, that\'s another
matter. But for the average independent small merchantman, he\'s out
of luck.

The Imperium cares little for the fate of the average person. It has,
IMO, the attitude that people are expected to fend for themselves.
It also has the attitude, again IMO, that the above attitude does not
apply towards well-connected people like nobles and business 
executives. Your average small merchant starship contains neither
and is out of luck.

Haven\'t read the Psionics Book, and I was trying to keep to IG stuff...

Just the other day I went through a prototype review of a major SAR
program we\'re reworking and we were debating exactly what to do about the
mix of metric and imperial measurements.  Imagine if someone misinterprets
our wave height/sea state field as being meters instead of feet.  That
would throw a wrench into the results!  It certainly would be an easier
world if we were all completely on one (scientific) measurement system. 
Maybe some year.

As for other examples of the risks of dual measurement systems there have
been a few documented cases (here in Canada) of planes running out/low on
fuel mid-air (and making emergency landings) because someone was confused
as to the measurement system.

I\'m using the standard rules straight out of MT (I assume that T4\'s are the
same but they\'re randomly spread across the book), and the players are just
carrying freight at the moment. I think the real fact is that those
refueling have an opportunity to make a higher profit as they can jump more
often. In cargo terms, I agree that they can cut delivery times by using
the starport.

In fact, I may introduce a ship that starts jumping and collecting freight
and cargo just before them and leaving them with a minimal selection just
to make this point. ;-)

	You beat me to the punch here Bruce :-)  But let me add that you 
don\'t even need to cover the whole 100-d limit to be an effective 
deterrant to piracy.
	Take the example of a system with just _one_ SDB and place it in 
orbit around the main world.  If a ship all the way out at the 100-d 
limit sent out a distress call and then surrendered to pirates, it would 
take the 4G SDB only 3 turns (1.5 hours) to bring the pirate within range of 
its weapons.  Now if the pirate is off-loading cargo at this point it 
cannot evade weapons fire at all, so the SDB will hit _every_ time.  
Since standard weapons fire 10 times per turn, the pirate will be very 
dead in a big hurry.  So even in systems so poor they can only afford one 
SDB, pirates will have to subdue their target and off-load all of their 
cargo in just 1.5 hours.
	Some people will argue that some systems are so poor they can\'t 
afford _any_ SDBs.  In Milieu Zero, I agree that this is very true.  
Ships venturing beyond the borders of the nascent Imperium will find lots 
of undefended worlds that cannot control piracy.  But within the control 
of the Imp Navy, pirates will have a very short life-span.
	One more idea for you.  Say you\'ve got an armed vessel in a 
sub-sector where trade is ravaged by pirates.  What will make you more 
money -- preying on the limited trade that exists, or hiring yourself out 
as an SDB?  If you just charge the merchants who pass through a fee and 
promise to chase off any pirates that enter the system, not only would 
your life be less violent, but trade would grow and you would have the 
support of merchants, world governments, everybody.  The merchants could 
even do this themselves with their limited weaponry by gathering together 
in convoys.  Unless those fractitious pirates can get similarly 
organized, the merchants will be able to travel in relative safety.

If this were to happen in my campaign I\'d have to say that they\'d have to get
a new hull built, and then the whole ship would have to be installed into
that new hull.

But, that\'s just the way I\'d handle it.

Hell, We just left Pysadi a few weeks back, with a bunch of Anolas in tow

it is true that this new hardcover book from IG incorporates previously
published materials (M:0 sourcebook, First Survey), it also includes a _lot_
of new material that any fan of Traveller would like to have for their
campaign, or their knowledge of the Third Imperium.  I can say that I wish
this kind of stuff had been around in the Classic Traveller era.  Any fan of
the Imperium _must_ have this book.

We are presented with more detailed information about the size of the
early Imperium--years 0-200, several entries about the surrounds of the
Imperium--vis-a-vis Pocket Empires, more detailing and expansion of the
Universal World Profile (UWP)--particularly an expansion of Law Levels is
provided, along with rationale for other pieces of the UWP.  There are also
patron encounters as well as a full-fledged adventure, complete with
deckplans for a Scout Cruiser.  Lastly, an expanded timeline/events list
more fully integrates the campaign with known information from CT/MT
background.

I should also say that I like the trend that has been established that the
referee has a _lot_ of latitude in what is detailed, and what is left to
each of us to do for ourselves.  This means a lot less throw-away lines,
and more meat and potatoes Traveller.  I love it.  If I hadn\'t started a
new "variant" universe campaign over a year ago, that my players are happy
with, I would switch to Milieu 0 in a heartbeat.  (Since several of my
players are known to get around, I should say that I never kill off a party
just to start fresh. :)

The glossy covers, complete with the eye-catching Foss artwork, continue
to make these products something to be coveted, and the excellent campaign
data appeal should attract any "black box" blueblood.

Finally, it makes clear that a Milieu is not just centered on the typical
assumption that the starting digit of the Milieu is "when" it is at, but
that the setting is for anyone wanting to run in 0, or any other year all
the way up to 200.

There is a mystery, however.  I don\'t know who did the work on the newly
added sections (continuing the M:0 sourcebook sequence) 9-12.  No offense
intended to anyone, but if these sections weren\'t written by Marc Miller,
it certainly rivals his style.

All in all, it really does make the difference having the two past works
combined with the new material to make a campaign book.  I may just have
to buy a second one as a "keeper."

	imho armor in T4 is broken :

	The hull (armor) has to be minimum 10*G rating in FFS terms.

	If I asume that FFS hull is T4 armor, I\'m wrong
	- there are several ships with 0 armor (they dont have a hull ;-)

	If I asume that the FFS hull is converted by the BR table, I\'m wrong
	- the scout would have a 500er hull.

	If I asume that the FFS hull is converted and multiplied by 10, ...
	- hand wave about the Gig or the Light Fighter, add a third rule.
	- what about the Ships Boat 6G should have 60 hull converted to 20 ?
	- the raw "military landing ship" would have a mass over 10000 tons
	  excluding anything besides hull&engine. So the powerplant of 750MW
	  would badly move the ship with 2G.

Ken,

Having watched some rather amazing pressure vessel rebuilds, and I
assume the repalcement of armor on a star ship to be a simular job,
here\'s my take on it. First it\'s not just a simple matter of striping
the old skin and throwing on the new. The new armor will be thicker,
obviuosly, so sensor leads, view port and airlock fittings, etc will
also have to be replaced or modified. The internal structure may need to
be beefed up to accomodate the added weight, not a factor in space, but
this is a ship that lands, and the added weight will be a factor there.
Landing gear will also have to be beefed up. All of this depends on the
amount of additional armor and can probably be figured from armor
factors and percentages.

Next consider the control surfaces. These may need to have heavier duty
actuators etc,

The Jump grid will prodably need to be repalced to fit the different
dimensions of the ship, unless they want to leave the outer dimensions
the same. Which creates the much more expensive situation of rebuilding
the ENTIRE internal structure to accomodate the thicker hul metal.

Then don\'t forget the Jumpdrive and manuver drive will need to be
reviewed. If the armor increase is large enough it could have an effect
here, possibly requireing an upgrade, or a degridation in proformance.

Most of these effects would hit the PC\'s in the pocket book more than
affect gameplay. So you as the Ref, have to make that call. Do you want
to strip away some extra capital, or make them think twice anout doing
the re-fit. On the other hand, if you don\'t have a disagreement with
them doing the re-fit, just assume this is all included in the cost of
adding the armor.

Oh, as far as charging them the DIFFERENCE between their current armor
and the new armor... I would charge them the cost of armor as if they
are placing it on a new ship, not the difference. I see this as
replaceing the entire hull plating, not layering it over the current
hull. Youcan calcuate a discount fo the scrap metal (the old hull
plating, suitable reduced since th scrap yard has to haul it away, they
may resell it but they will still deduct a major amount from whatever
price they think they can get for it!). If you elect to allow them to
layer it on the current armor, you might concider lowering the armor
factor slightly (-1 level or so) since, no matter how good the fitters
the fit between layers will not match exactly. (hmm, or may be the
opposite would be true, making it stronger, since the slight gap could
act as aspring for physical impact, and the armor have something of an
ablative effect. Seem to remember something like this in tank armor a
few years ago. Anyboy on the list hear of this? and have any details?).

At any rate that\'s my take on it, for what it\'s worth.

The economics of insurance are pretty hard and fast.  The insurance
company trades paying a fixed sum for a possibility of having
to pay a large sum.  The insurance company is able to pay out
the large sums because it handles a lot of them, so the ones
where they have to pay out are balanced by the ones where they
pay nothing.  They then use this to charge a premium against those
who need to be protected from the risk.  Note: it is only an
expense that exceed you cash flow that makes insurance necessary.
If you can afford to handle the loss yourself, insurance is
always more expensive

In your case....
On average, the Insurance company will need to pay out the 
possible sum (the cost of the ship) times the probability 
that it will occur.  Since they intend to make a profit
(over the long run at least) they will now charge more
than this average cost to the client.  This could range
from 20% (for 

So if there is a 2% chance of loosing a 63 MCr ship in a
year.  Then the insurance company will figure an average
expense of 1.2 MCr.  Figure it costs them 5%/year to make
sure they have the money available and that they want to
make a 20% return on the deal, they would charge at least
1.5 MCr.  If it was a sellers market, this could range up
to 2-3 MCr.  This might also be true if the company was
small enough that a 63 MCr payout could endanger it\'s
future (there is a reason the insurance companies are
big).   Alternatively, a small company desperate for
business might decide to sell such a policy for below
cost figuring that if the ship comes back they it\'s
all profit, and if it doesn\'t they just go out of
business (if the company is only worth a small amount
of money, then this becomes a good gamble).

Bravo Martin,

I like the "Philadelphia Experiment" feel of the 3 crewmen! With your
permission, I\'d like to use some of these ideas. (Not that I might not twist
them and use them any way, but my Mom always insisted I should be polite ;).
Thank you for the niffty new ways to play mind games with the PC\'s.

No, but the US does assist lesser countries in defending their borders.  If Rhylanor is

Its a roleplaying problem.  The fact is that they are treating the
time spent travelling back to and from the gas giant as "free" since...
a) They get more money per game session (which the players care
more about) than per month of their character\'s lives (which
their characters would care about).
b) If they are also just jumping in, grabbing cargo/freight, and
jumping right out, then you need to start (after a few weeks)
telling them that they have been basically going straight (either
working their tails off on planet or cooped up in space the
size of a modest apartment) for some time and it\'s beginning
to wear thin.

You can\'t have arrival slots since you can\'t communicate faster than
you can travel you can\'t arrange for people to be expecting you (except
the send whole \'nother ship, though this might be another way that 
jump torps could fundamentally change things, but we won\'t get into 
that :-)  Also, you have interplanetary travel and a ship could easily
pose as ship arriving, departing, or passing by the planet on an
interplanetary trip.

Well, not all ships are going to be using the same departure and exit
areas.  In fact, it the ships that are not near the usual spots, and

Well, Regina has to have a dozen patrols just for the main world (and
in fact, you want them in twos or threes since you don\'t want to make
sure that they will be able to out gun the pirate).  And then you are
going to need ships to spell them.  And then you are going to have to
patrol all the other inhabited worlds and also the gas giants.  (And
the gas giants are going to take more than a dozen ships.)  Then
Regina has to spend money on it\'s contribution to the Imperial Navy
(which, for a rich world, will be significant).  Then you have to
convince them to spare a dozens of ships to guard each of all those
fringe marginal planets.

Well, I\'m not sure what you are using for your calculation of the
naval budget.  But the numbers of ships I see it as taking, and the
minor costs the piracy causes the Imperium to suffer, I don\'t see
it as being a big worthwhile.

I think, in general, Traveller astrography would be more interesting if
there were fewer inhabited/habitable worlds and more systems with 
only gas giants. This makes warfare more interesting - gas giant refuelling
is a necessity, fleets can be snuck into enemy territory, supply lines can
be disrupted - and certainly makes piracy/privateering more important, as 
there will be lots of merchants doing field refuelling in otherwise-uninhabeted
systems. If I were to run a military-oriented campaign I\'d probably set it in
such a region. (For example, it could be a region of mostly Population II
stars, with too few heavy elements to form non-gaseous planets...)

For departures pehaps, but not for arrivals. There\'s no way a planet
can know who or what is coming there, because everything takes a week
to jump. Of course, neither does a pirate know what\'s arriving...

How do you get only 12 ships are needed to patrol such an enormous
sphere? Has the weapon ranges increased so much that this number is
all that\'s necessary?

What\'s in it for them to do this, though? If there\'s no benefit, no
one\'s going to help out of the goodness of their hearts.

Now, on page 75, where the SSDS rules are, it says that Structure is
ship displacement in tons times G-Rating.  Then convert this number

OK.  So 200 x 2 = 400.  On the USP chart, 400 corresponds to a USP of 9.

Why is the structure of this ship 12 instead of 9?

Joe Walsh\'s Secure Trader, on page 32, has Armor 40.

How was that number determined?
How much did that armor cost?



I see on page 70 the rules for armor price, volume, and mass.  But, I am
confused by the rule on page 75 for determining Armor Rating.

Let\'s follow this through.

What I\'m trying to find out is how much all of the armor cost.

On page 70, it says to multiply the armor level desired by the volume
factor from the hull sheet.

Our volume factor is 0.71.  The armor level is 40, from the ship\'s
description on page 32.

0.71 x 40 = 28.4

The volume of the ship\'s hull taken up by the armor is 28.4 cubic
meters.

Right?

That hull, on page 32, looks to me like a cylinder.  It\'s a 200 ton
hull, and I\'d say it is streamlined.  It is definitely not an airframe.

Now,to find the cost, we multiply 28.4 by the cost per cubic meter for
TL 12 superdense material (listed on page 77).

So, the cost for the armor of this vessel is 28.4 x 0.014.

That\'s Cr397,600.

Right?

Now we multiply for streamlining.  397,600 x .8.

That\'s Cr318,080.

For 40 points of armor on this 200 ton hull, it costs Cr318,080?

Heck.  If that is all it costs, then I\'m armoring all of my ships to the
hilt.

Now, I am confused.  On page 75, it says to convert the armor value
chosen using the USP chart.

How does that play a part in all of this?

I want to end up with armor 40, and I want to figure out how much it
costs to do this.

Thanks for the help.

The TA is the best!

This is about the third time I\'ve run it, and each time it\'s been
different.

Of course, I just use it for the spine of my overall story.  I have
greatly modified this one.  In fact, Eneri Giilaan, a minor character in
the actual adventure, is a big Naval Intelligence type (read:  I\'m
playing him like a nasty CIA type) who\'s pulling the strings.

We are having a blast.  Marc did an excellent job on this one.

> Good story, too.

Thanks.  I really appreciate that.  I\'ve been getting private e-mails
from my players.  I sent them the story last night, so they are just now
reading it at work today.  They really liked it as well.

It\'s always nice to get to work, pop on your e-mail, and be surprised
with a story about your character.  It sure gives you a heck of a lot
more to think about at lunch than work.

And, it keeps my players thinking about the game inbetween sessions. 
They are always eager to come back, especially after a story like this.

I encourge creativity in my game.  I\'ve had two of the players write
stories of their own.  Sometimes its something that happened in the
character\'s past, and sometimes they "novelize", as I do, events that
happen in the game.

Two game sessions ago, one of my players rewarded the other with a
drawing of the other players character in action.

The game before, we had this big shoot out in a bar on Aramis.  Frank,
the character drawn, was crouching down behind the bar while the bad
guys came and were searching for him in between the tables.

The player said, "Hey, doesn\'t this bar have some sort of shotgun or
pistol or club or something, like most bars do?"

You already know that the guy didn\'t have a weapon.  Of course, the guys
looking for him were carrying TL 13 Gauss Pistols and wearing diplo
under their long coats.

I thought the player was creatively thinking, so I says to him, "Well,
maybe.  Let\'s find out.  It sounds like a 50-50 proposition.  Beat me
higher dice."

He rolled a D6,and I rolled a D6.  He won.

Good for him, I thought to myself.

Well, let\'s see.  I looked at the map.  There was the bar area the
character was in.  There was a back room office/storage area adjacent to
that area, and there was another bar area on the other side of the
establishment.

"We\'ll roll one die.  On a 1 or 2, there\'s a weapon in the storage
room.  On a 3 or 4, the weapon is in the bar area that your character is
in.  And, on a 5 or 6, there\'s a weapon in the other bar area."

Bam.  I rolled  a 3.  Lucky dude.

This is the time in my games when things really start getting
interesting.  The players start to sweat--one missed die roll can send
them down the wrong road, in this case without a weapon.

"OK," I said,"there is a weapon in your bar area.  Let\'s see what it
is.  We\'ll roll a die.  1 to 3, the weapon is a club or something like
that.  4 or 5, I\'ll give you a pistol.  On a 6, I\'ll give you a rifle of
some sort--probably a shotgun."

I pushed the die towards the player.  He looked at it, then picked a die
from his own pile.  Players are finicky like that.  The get pretty
superstitious about their dice.

After the careful selection, he rolls.

It\'s a 6!

The whole table smiles at me.

"OK," I said again, "you get a shotgun.  TL 10 OK with you?"

The player smiled wider.

"Now, let\'s find out where the shotgun is in the bar are.  It\'s 6 meters
long by 3 meters.  There\'s twelve total squares here.  I\'ll roll 1 die
to determine which row the shotgun is kept--1 to 3 it\'s on the far row
away from the character.  4 to 6, its on under the bar area somewhere,
in the row where the character is crouching."

I rolled.  It was in the character\'s row.

"We now know the row.  I\'ll simply roll 1 die,"  I numbered the squares,
"on a 5, it is right above the character\'s head, clamped to the
underside of the bar."

I tossed the die up.

It seemed like slow motion.

It took forever to fall to the table.

And...pop, pop...it was a 5!!!!

The table cheered!  The player\'s teeth were showing,his smile was so
big!

It was one of those magical moments that happen in role playing.  This
is what the addiction is all about.  This is why we keep coming
back--putting our busy lives on hold, hours at a time, for more and
more. 

Frank, the character, grabbed the shotgun, pumped it once to shove in a
shell, and swung over the bar, blasting away.

This is the drawing the one player gave to Frank\'s player.  It was
Frank, flopped up over the bar, pulling hard on that shotgun trigger.

Truly...a magical moment.

Amazingly enough, this is not the tank I was mentioning.  In 1944 designs had

nature.  Hitler wanted it built, but the Waffen SS convinced him that more
Royal(King) Tigers were needed instead.

The largest "production tank" of the was was the JagdTiger tank which carried
a 128mm/48(?) calibre main gun and weighed in at a whopping 75mt.  The
transmission and powerplant used could barely keep up with the beating and as
a result these tanks became little more than glorified mobile pillboxes.

After thinking about this long and hard, I think you are right.

I\'ve never handled this situation before in a game.  Now I know that the

Players always love it when you tell them No.

Thanks, Mike, for a very detailed post.

I\'m forwarding your post in its entirety to my players for reasoning why
I\'m not going to allow this.

I had already decided that this is a bad idea, and your post fills in
all the justification blanks that I\'m going to have to fill with my
players--especially since I already hinted that it might be possible.

A GMs job is never done.

You just made it easier.

Thanks again,

First of all I want to make something clear: I am pretty new to Traveller.

I read these rules quite a few times, and this is the way I understood them
(and thus use them):

The armor rating you purchase isn\'t the one used in the game. It will have
to be converted into USP rating using the chart on page 107. The USP rating
is the value used in space combat, the other value is simply there for
calculation purposses. This means that twice as much armor costs far more
than twice as much cash, which sounds very logical to me (heavier armor IS
harder to build, after all).

In your example, you have bought 40 points of armor. This would convert to
an armor rating of 2. If you would want an armor rating of 40, you would
have to buy 47000 points of armor (MUCH more expensive).

If there is anything wrong with this way of thinking, please tell me.

Wasn\'t one of the big irritants about Starships (apart from the colour
plates separating the SSDS section, the truly awful deckplans, and the
designs of some of the classic ships, excuse me while I stop slavering...)
the fact that most of the ships in the book could not be designed with QSDS
or SSDS?

Solution: throw away starships, and dig out CT Book 2 and Book 5 and adopt
High Guard as the design and combat sequence for T4. It works for me....
And you can use supplement 7 traders and gunboats for deckplans...

Starlane Drive Manufacturers hereby offers to come to an \'arrangement\' with
Famille Spofulam on the disposal of surplus scout sensor suites. Name your
price and let\'s negotiate! ;-)

____

Sources in the Diaspora sector suggest that Starlane Drive Manufacturers
are considering the construction of a series of remote sensor stations to
operate in conjunction with the newly deployed \'Pirana\' class SDB.

A spokesman for the company has been quoted as saying - "By deploying
remote sensor stations, tenders and a shoal of Piranas, almost any world
may defend itself against the aggression of the Vilani autocrat \'Cleon I\'.
Of course, with our Old Earth Union sponsorship, we\'ll be developing new
defenses against the Imperial Expansionism of the Syleans."

Sorry, but I have to disagree. You can format or encode your active signal
to give you loads of data about a target which just can\'t be obtained from a
passive sensor, even given the r^2/r^4 difference in returned signal.

Also, I think your c-speed weaponry declaration seems to assume that your
sensor is attached directly to the weapon (thus as long as it points in the
right direction the range is irrelevant), whereas a large number of sensors
will be quite detached from the weapons and used for non-weapon guidance.
Without the ability to resolve in all three dimensions you can\'t
*efficiently* map the location of each ship in an opponents\' battle fleet.

Apologies if I\'ve misunderstood your argument? :-?

SSDS is my favorite (no, really) design system, WHEN you get the
errata... Without the errata, it blows chunks...

1) Armor
To find the armor USP rating...
Take the armor rating you chose in the design sequence...find the USP value
rating, then multiply by ten. For example, a armor rating of 20 will give
you a USP rating of 10 (20 -> 1 -> 10)


2) Interior Structure
YOu are correct that the rating is based on G-Rating and Hull Size...but
one of the things you can do is rate the hull for a larger G-Rating than
the actual speed of the ship. Thus, even though a ship might have a 2-G
drive, the hull might be rated for 4-Gs. This is for several reasons:
the obvious is that your structure rating is larger, thus you can absorb 
more damage. The other reason is to support upgrades - you might have
a 2-G version of the ship and a 4-G version...in order to use the same
hull, the hull must be rated 4 G.

I "overrate" my hulls a lot for small combat vessels, to increase their
survivability.

As far as loading up on armor or structure...sure, in the grand scheme 
of things, it might be cheap...but it eats up volume. Plus, if you use
realistic thrust...armor is HEAVY. You start putting a great deal of
armor on, and your 4-G drive can really only drive you 2-G...

....of course, you can ignore realistic thrust, in which case you only
lose volume...

Gearhead alert!

If  you have never dismantled one of your favorite toys just to see how it 
worked, do yourself a favor and skip this email.

A recent private email exchange with a list member , Jory Earl, got me 
thinking about the following...

What physical problems would the TML gearheads like to see computer modeled? 

I work in the engineering analysis software field for a company which 
produces "Multi-Physics Analysis Software". Our product , ANSYS, can solve 
nearly any physical design problem given enough computer resources and 
modelling effort.

Hypothetical example 1 - Acceleration stresses in starship hull
Given Material properties (density, youngs modulus, etc..) and physical hull 
layout, the stresses involved in a 4-G maneuver could be applied to a 2-G 
Hull.

Hypothetical example 2 - Fusion reactor model
ANSYS has been used to model tokamac reactors. Would anyone on the TML be 
able to come up with a  rough TL-13 fusion power plant design?

My background is Masters Degree, Mechanical engineer. I have completed 
structural, thermal, electrostatic, and impact analysis with this software 
in the past. I am not very familiar with the dynamics or fluid dynamics 
features of the software.
I currently work in the software verification group.

Given the extremely high gearhead coefficient of this post I will be happy 
to communicate through private email.

Thanks,
Glenn

According to the SSDS errata available at

here is the bit on armour:

Notice in T4 (QSDS) and the Big Table O\' Hulls that all the hull armours are 
by a factor of ten.  The way I do the hull armour is to reverse the above 
mentioned procedure.

If I want a ship with an armour rating of 20, I would divide by 10 to get 2, 
then look on the USD chart for the \'armour value\' needed.  In this case it 
is 40 (or more).  Then  I would multi 40 by the volume factor to find out 
how much stuff it takes.  Lets use good old fasioned TL-10 Cystaliron on a 
100ton Wedge:

40 x 1.13(hull volume factor on chart) = 45.2m^3
45.2m^3 x 0.009Mcr(cost of Crystaliron per m^3) = 0.4068Mcr
45.2m^3 x 10t/m^3(mass of Crystaliron per m^3) = 452 tons Mass

This also explains the reason why the merchant and other ships have armour 
ratings of 0.  If the ship has a rating lower than 20, it will be 0 when 
converted to USD.  The Free Trader could have a armour value of 15, strong 
enough to stop bullets and maybe just barely a PGMP splatter, but a ships 
laser will rip through it like a hot kinfe through butter!

Armour for vehicles can be converted this way as well as the "armour value 
chosen" in the begining equates almost the same with vehicle armours.  SSDS 
is the "Childe of FF&S" after all :)  Done this actualy, the results are, if 
you are not inside a grav tank or other heavily armoured vehicle and you are 
hit by a ships laser, even at low power, Sie sind kaput!

	Actually Scott This information is not correct.  The Germans actually
built 3 Maus tanks, as well as had several E-100 Tank hulls under
construction at wars end.  The E-100 was based on the Maus, and in fact
used the same turret with a different main gun.  The Maus tanks while in
the testing stages had been left on the testing grounds with numerous
\'soviet hammer and cicle\' markings to confuse the American Army Air Force
recon.  If you are stating the heaviest production tank as being the
JagdTiger, then that is correct.  Several other vehicles had been designed
and built that were used for specialty operations that weighed much more
than the E-100 and Maus - for instance the \'Thor\' and \'Loki\' Gerat -040 and
Gerat-041 seige mortars.  All of this information is spelled out clearly in
the \'Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War II\' book.  If you would like
ISBN Numbers and author I can get them - I don\'t have them with me at the
moment.

	The book is very informative and offers a great deal of information
regarding the history, production number, hull numbers, weight, armor
thickness and angle, gun, radio, crew, etc, etc.

Many months ago I advocated to IG that they create various mailing lists for
IG writers to discuss things, and a \'secure\' web source of T4 and previous
\'canon\' data for writers. Whether these will eventually be created, I have
no idea.

Until a short while ago some of us writers (e.g. those within CORE) were
swapping the draft texts around so everyone knew roughly what was going on,
but now even that has stopped.

	The LSP shipyard here, along with Strouden, is one of the major

level D technology make its products sought after. [Supplement 3]
	The LSP shipyards at Lunion and Strouden are two of the largest
producers of starship hulls in the Marches. They specialize in warships for
the Imperial Navy. [Spinward Marches Campaign, p. 19.]

In the New Era, Lunion progresses to TL 15 thanks to the Regency Industrial
Development Program, so you can bet the planet is technologically
progressive. The Regency Sourcebook also describes the Lunion School of
Economics as being the premiere business school of the Spinward Marches.
Obviously, this reputation would extend back to pre-Collapse times.

Ling Standard Products also remains a force to be reckoned with in the New Era.

I have been searching for a copy of the Mac version of that program, off

One of the points mentioned in several reviews when it was first released was 
that it was *too* nice - the real thing would be much worse.

Ah yes. Mem-reez, like the corners of my mind, misty water col<slap>
Sorry.

I remember a friend\'s Traveller game when I introduced the gauss rifle. I
was the first with books 4-5. We were in a desperate combat, and losing. My
character drew his Gauss Rifle and fired. the GM said, "you showed me this,
what was it, like an autorifle?" "Something like that", I replied. The guy
next to me says "I fire my autorifle, so that is 2 possible hits at 3D6" and
he rolls to hit, another guy says "I fire my laser rifle that\'s only one hit
but it is 5D6" (smirks). I fire the gauss rifle and say "two targets get hit
by 3 4D6 hits each". They went pale. One player looked at me and said "can I
have one of those?"

Shortly thereafter, everyone had gauss rifles. Then we engaged an enemy
g-Carrier. Our gausses were useless, so I got out my other weapon; a
FGMP-15. Another player asked me if this was deadlier than the gauss, and I
said yes. Then I rolled to hit and asked if I could borrow some dice, as the
weapon did 16D and I only had 4 on me. Their expressions were priceless. I
caused another arms race again later in a diferent campaign but that is
another story

I have a hard time inmagining how one could misinterpit a \'M\' for a \'Ft\' 
or \'yd\'.  Weren\'t the type of measures used with the number, there are 
standard symbols.  If they are used then multiple measurement systems can 
be used.  After the long night I suspect there would be a lot of 
different systems in use, especialy from worlds that regressed down to 
TL0-3.

Well, I just happen to be compiling a comprehensive list of Traveller Web
Sites (still needs lots of work) and can provide some of what you ask for;

Joe Heck\'s Web Site has an excellent collection, some good some bad;

http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/software/

For single World Building on a Mac at the WBH detail level get Metator from
the above site, Rob Prior\'s excellent single planet expander.

For PC\'s, Jo Grant\'s Library is available at the above site and at;

http://members.nova.org/~sol/core/uploads.htm

I\'m not sure, but I think the Core site has the later version.  By Jo\'s own
admission this DOS program is a bit unstable, but it is also extremely
heavy in detail, generating color surface maps for planets (which are the
same after you go to another planet and come back) giving all the detail
you need to the limits of WBH etc.

	I agree with you whole-heartedly.  I\'d prefer such a setting for 
non-military campaigns as well.  But you wouldn\'t have to even envoke Pop 
II stars, just change the world design system to one that doesn\'t 
generate nice, comfy, habitable worlds around every other star.  Make 
those systems that do have planetary systems have a selection of barren 
rocks, venusian hell holes, and gas giants.  Heck, if you wanted to be 
generous, let there be a few worlds with water ice, but no liquid oceans 
for easy dipping.  This makes patrolling all that empty space a lot more 
difficult and GG refueling much more attractive.  The habitable worlds 
would be much fewer and far more special.  Oh yeah, and put some of those 
GGs in real close to their star and inside its 100-d limit, just to be 
nasty ;-)  And a 3-d starmap, definitely a 3-d starmap.
	If I ever do my own campaign setting, this is what it 
would look like.

Right. I thought of that too.

So, if you go through the calculations, and buy 47000 points of
armor--so that it can be converted to a final USP armor of 40--you
spend...

....a whopping Cr373,744,000!!!!


> If there is anything wrong with this way of thinking, please tell me.


Well, Joe Walsh\'s Secure Trader on page 32 has 40 points of armor, and
the entire ship only costs Cr88,100,000!


10% Discount or no, armor didn\'t cost MCr373.4 for that ship.

So, my questions remains.

How much did the armor cost for Joe Walsh\'s Secure Trader?

You can get range somewhat more quickly from an active sensor (since you
don\'t have to solve for it) and radial velocity more precisely (which is
relatively irrelevant) and good spatial resolution in the radial direction
(but not the azimuthal or elevation direction), but that\'s about it. 
It\'s very hard to beat the r^2/r^4 dependence...another thing that is hard to
beat is that the most pracitcal wide-field active sensors will use 
radio waves, or possibly millimetre or submillimetre radio - which 
(since resolution scales as wavelength) gives you terrible angular resolution,
so you need very high signal-to-noise and lots of tricks to get a 
good fire control solution.

To take a real world example, the illustrious Simbad Sam informs me that the
1980s SDI airborne laser tests, using radar for targeting, had to cheat
(radar reflectors and maybe even transponders on the target) to get a
position good enough to hit a missile with a laser. The new USAF laser
project has dropped radar in favour of passive IR and LIDAR.

due to the rushed schedule and the absence of guidance from IG, but there are
a lot of good ideas in there; and people (like me) who are buying it today

If I discover that it\'s another expensive supply of scrap paper, I\'ll be

Marc, could you tell us what your plans are? Are you staying with the FFS-

T4.1 abandons FFS2\'s rules completely, you should include conversion notes

Heck!  This sounds like Air Force One!  You could make a modern day

I hear ya.  Me too.

And, I\'m pretty faithful to the things I roll behind the screen or in
between games.  Recently, we had a couple of characters go to Aramis. 
One of the characters, the ship\'s Captain, is a mafia type in hiding. 
He\'s actually a Baron, from the planet Tureded, which in my campaign,
with no law level, is a hot bed of these giant family houses who control
the black market in the area.

House Praygor, the Captain\'s house, was decimated about 10 months ago by
the union of two Houses, House Jade-London.

The Jadist men have been on Praygor\'s tail since the start of the
campaign (1.7 years real time, 8 months game time).

Praygor make the mistake of going somewhere he\'s been before--Aramis.  I
roll to see if they pick him up at the starport (there\'s word out on the
street that there is a reward for his head of over MCr1).  Yes, they do.

I follow them around town, then, just as they get back to the starport,
I roll, and I loose him.

I kept the tail on his friend, Frank, which explains who the bad guys
were in that last post where I explained the scene where Frank found the
shotgun.

All the while, Praygor, the main guy they are after, is snug in the ship
he came in.  He never leaves the starport after that, and the public
news channel starts reporting on this massacre at this local bar.

All of this, just because I missed a doggone roll.  My target was
Praygor, not Frank.

Oh well.  I rolled. I keep it.

> There\'s no heroism without the feeling of real danger, so I supply plenty
> of danger!

Exactly.  That\'s why I do so many rolls in my game.  Big things happen
with the roll of a die.  Sometimes I\'ll skew it--beat me by two, or
something like that.  Sometimes it\'s 50-50.

> And occasionally, I get to bury a player. (sorry. CHARACTER).

I know.  We\'ve been through plenty of NPC\'s, but, until recently, we
have had all the original characters who started the campaign a year and
a half ago.

And, we\'ve been through some real dangers.

On Aramis, we broke into the Leedor Museum.

On Natoko, they broke into the secure communications facility in the
Tukera building to delete the message from Aramis, wanting them for the
crime they committed there.

On Patinir, we fought TL 16 androids on a mining asteroid base.

On Pysadi, we\'ve fought unknown aliens being used by the Zhodani for
forward intel in preparation for the Fifth Frontier War.

And--GET THIS.

Finally on the planet of Pysadi, two characters try to go harvest some
howood in the small town of Itzeny on the other side of the planet.

They are in the wilderness, so I made some animal encounter charts.

And after going through all of that above--blasting off of Aramis,
fighting Tukera guards on Natoko, barely escaping a mining base as it\'s
fusion reactor blows the asteroid to bits, and fighting never before
seen aliens on a deep-system science station--the first character in our
group to bite it is done in by a randomly generated Pysadian animal!

After living though all that bloodshed and flying lead, he was mauled to
death!

What a way to go.  Kinda like Patton.

It is dark.  A storm is in progress.  You are tired, and on bridge watch.
Yu glance at a guage that shows seas state, and your eyes pick out the 10
on the display.  You do not notice that large Ft.

This is why many military helicopters have all the gauges at a strange
angle - they are set up so that "proper operation" puts all of the needles
at 45 degrees.  Anything deviating from that is easy to pick out by eye.

>At the outset of the First Interstellar War, what worlds do you think are

The Terrans had settled very few worlds, imho.  I looked through an old
copy of Solomani Rim, and picked a very small set of them, since they
contacted the Vilani at very close range.  On the other hand, I decided
that earth never suffered a population crash, so that they had billions and
billions of people all over the solar system.

IMHO, the Vilani colonization policy discouraged progress beyond TL9, but
encouraged progress up to it.  They kept all shipyards with significant
productive capacity either at TL 9, or in a few selected Naval bases.  This
kept regional governors from wanting to revolt - the home fleet could crush
anyone, given time to arrive.  Select worlds were at TL10, but development
of TL11 military and space technologies were discouraged.

The best way to do this, in my canon, is to limit the population.  This
way, the few people far beyond the tails of the distribution can be
located, and carted off to the core Vilani worlds which were at TL11.  In
order to have the Empire run efficiently, they made sure that any settled
world was within J1 of about 100 million people, but discouraged billions
of people on any world that did not have a Naval base and an R&D lab.

This meant, IMHO, that at the outbreak of the ISW, there were a whole bunch
of Vilani-colonized worlds at various tech levels between about 5 and 10,
with the vast majority at TL9, and the populations at ~50 million.

I am playing it that the 3I has inherited the same policies, but that when
they reach late 1100, the standard TL has become TL12, and they have tried
to put more worlds at roughly 150M, so that any seven worlds form a good
combination that can maintain high tech trade.  This meshes well with J2
drives, as one would expect something like ten worlds to be within J2 of
any other world in a settled area.

OK, so your limit in armor is volume.  And, the extra weight put on will
require you to get a bigger drive in the design sequence.

It makes sense now.

You get distance (travel time of a ping). You get radial motion
(doppler shift of ping). RA and declination (postition on sky). You
can image with it on the order of a wavelenth, but you can image
with passives as well. I\'m sure there are a couple more exotic
things (?) that I can\'t think of off the top of my head
(polarization changes?) but it isn\'t all that great. Passives tell
you all but range, and you get that via simple trig. Radial motion
can be had by having a passive look for shifted spectral lines
(emission or absorbtion) not to mention 2 triangulations in
succession. Frankly, I don\'t see why radar is all that useful at
long ranges since it does little more, but will announce you to
passives farther away.

I think the assumption is that a ship will use its sensors in an
intergrated way (though there will be some dedicated FC sensors,
most sensors can be used for Fire Control). The real point is that
at *long* ranges (what we are discussing) the lag to the target
makes any benefits of radar (instantaneous data on radial velocity,
for example) moot since the weapon travel time vastly exceeds any
difference in the time it takes to build up the data with a passive
sensor.

You need 2 observations to get z with a passive.  One with a radar.
But the radar has to wait twice as long since the pulse has to go
both ways, so you could just look twice in the same perion with the
passive and have the same data (ships will move many kms in the time
interval so you get a decent baseline).

If two or more ships in *your* fleet are datalinked, then they can
observe at the same time. Might be neat to make rules for a sensor
ship that acts as a clearinghouse for ssensor data in a task
force...

	Ignore all the ship designs in "Starships." People on the list slaved long
and hard over them, only to have many of the actual designs ignored and the
numbers made up from thin air.

Here\'s how it would work: You designate a fairly large sphere a bit outside
the jump limit as the arrival area. All ships know that they have to arrive
within that area (It\'s the law). You have as many patrol ships as the traffic 
warrants stationed there. When a ship arrives it is given a place in a queue 
and told to wait. While the ship is waiting it is inspected by the patrol.
Any ship with weapons have them deactivated. Once the \'Orbital Guard\' has
made sure of the ship\'s identity and general harmlessness it is allowed to
proceed down to the surface.

I suppose a pirate might try to hijack the inspecting patrol ship...

If piracy is a problem then ships will use the designated arrival and
departure areas. Losing a few hours may be distressing for a merchant,
but not nearly as distressing as losing a cargo (Or getting a thumping
fine for violating regulations).

A world like Regina will have a lot more than a few paltry 400 T patrol
ships. 70% of its naval budget goes to system defenses. That\'s all those
orbital fortresses and cruiser-sized SDBs that has to hang around anyway
to prevent Mr. Zho from coming calling. They should be able to deal with
a pirate or two while they\'re waiting.

The other worlds, yes, the Gas Giants, no. Splitting your naval strength
in two or three is simply an invitation to be defeated in detail.

>Then Regina has to spend money on it\'s contribution to the Imperial Navy
>(which, for a rich world, will be significant).  

30% of their naval budget, half for subsector forces, half for regular
forces.

They could well spare them, but they won\'t have to. That\'s one of the
things the Imperial Navy will do for them.

TCS figures. Cr500 per citizen per year. Naval strength is equivalent to
10 times that (ship maintenance in TCS costs 10% of the ship\'s cost
annually, and includes everything from recruitment posters to pensions).
So a planet with 10 billion people will have a naval budget of 5,000,000
MCr and a navy of 50,000,000 MCr. 1/1000th of that is 50,000 MCr and a
400 T patrol ship costs, what, about 100 MCr? (that figure be somewhat 
off, I don\'t have the right books with me). That would be about 500 patrol
ships  --  sorry, only 350, since they pay 30% of their budget to the
Imperial Navy. 

The new PE rules will change things around a bit, but any way you slice it,
10 billion people can afford to support quite a few ships.

It\'s my impression that most governments don\'t like pirates. Perhaps they
resent the competition. Historically, whenever pirates have flourished, the 
reason has been the authorities\' lack of the capability to restrain them, 
not their lack of will to do so. I believe the first war the US fought was 
one to stop another government from extorting money from passing US 
merchantmen. And with the kind of resources the Imperium commands they DO 
have the capability to restrain piracy. That\'s kind of my main point. They
can do it if they want to. To say that they wouldn\'t want to is IMO utterly 
and completely implausible.

See above. Everybody aims for an area withing the range of a patrol ship.
it dosen\'t matter if you arrive next to a pirate, because the pirate
wouldn\'t dare do anything while he is under the guns of the proud ships
of the Limit Guard.

Well, someone else did those calculations and I won\'t defend them. But,
as I said, you don\'t need to defend the whole shell, so even if the
figure is wrong, it dosen\'t matter.

What\'s in it for a police officer rushing to stop a robbery in progress?

OTOH keeping your defensive forces together around your mainworld is a lot
better than splitting it up in two or three or four or five, allowing an
enemy to defeat you with one half or one third or one fourth or one fifth 
of the forces he would otherwise need.

I can\'t argue specifically against this, because I don\'t know just what
assumptions you\'re making about the price and area covered by a mine, but
I reccomend you decide on how much a mine would cost, how big an area it
would be able to cover, and how long it would last before failing and
then work out how many you need to cover an entire Gas Giant. I suspect
you will find that it is not so cheap after all.

The main problem with a non coherent form of an active(radar) is that the
higher the frequency the greater the detail, the lower the frequency the
longer the range. Basically it is this:

High Frequency= greater details, short ranges
Low Frequency= Longer ranges, loss of details

I can remember exactly but there is limit to amount of Power(Watts) that
you can pump into a high freq radar, after that the power(watts) is wasted.

At the space ranges radar would have to a very low frequency to get the
range needed, the accuracy would be very way off. Not very good for
precision weapons fire. But it would be good for an early detection system,
then you hand the target over to a more precise sensor, like a laser or
even a maser. But being active all the time is very bad for a military
situations.

By the way while in the USN I worked on four radars for fire control, three
had freqs in mega to giga hertz range, those were trackers/fire control,
the forth radar\'s waveguide was greater than my hand could span ie greater
than 6 inches.
The forth radar was a scanner, it detected the targets, then handed off to
one of the other three, due to its lack of precise target location.

Bruce have you given any thought to a maser sensor or would you class that
with lasers. A maser would have better dust penetration than a laser. A
maser would make for great orbit to ground scanner to get through the
atmospheric conditions.

Cheating! Hell it was a rigged fight, they had a Lunberg(sp) Lense on the
front of the missile to enhance the radar return, the IFF transponder ID
number and frequency, altitude, speed, course, and bearing to the firing
aircraft. You can\'t rig a test any better than that.

Don\'t count on them being different. Units of measurement persist for
*very* lomg times. The mile goes back more than 2000 years. Ditto for
the pound. I\'m not sure about other measurements.

What *will* happen is the the *name* will change somewhat due to
language drift, and the exact value of the unit will drift some. But
likely not by more than +/- 25%.

So after recontact, making the shift should be pretty simple.

I remember a former Coast Guard posting to the net about joining the CG
in order to avoid Vietnam only to find himself sweeping for mines in the
Mekong Delta. But that\'s besides the point. The Coast Guard may not go
foreign to protect merchantmen, but the Navy sure as hell does.

I was using Rhylanor as an example of a world that could afford to support
more ships than it needed to protect its own system. If they don\'t send
ships directly then they turn over some of their funds to the Imperium
and the Imperium sends the ships. In the final analysis it\'ll still be 
Rhylanor and the other high-population planets that pays.

So why are US Navy ships nosing around in the Mediteranean and the Red
Sea and the Indian Ocean?

If the Imperium had so few resources that they were forced to chose between
what worlds to cover, then I might agree with you. But the whole point is
that the Imperium controls enough assets to cover every one of it\'s
10,000 systems.

Astronomical? A couple of square kilometers of land, for which you may or
may not have to pay, a few buildings, a communications suite, a bit of a
fence, a workshop, a stock of spare parts,and a fusion plant. Personally
I\'d add a fuel purification plant, but that is not strictly speaking
necessary for a Class C starport. Add half a dozen employees and you are 
in business (Did I forget anything?) That won\'t cost you as much as a
single merchant ship (In fact, load an obsolete Class M merchant with
some prefabs, a surplus mobile fabrication unit, and a few \'impress the
natives\' kits and you\'d have an instant starport package). 

The rest of your posting sounds good except that the poor licencees will
get awfully hungry on what they can earn from their starport until the
Imperial border catches up with them ;-). But if they can wait 20 years
for a return on their money, then it sounds like a good investment.

Andy,

Since I am in part responsible for the thread you were replying to, and other
parts of it that I hope you also read, involved what some seem to have
misinterpreted as a cut to TLWH and Gateway. I wanted to reply to you and say
thanks. This was the primary point I was trying to make, that without some way
to check "new" writings and "new" writers\' works, other than to rag on them on
this list, it is impossible NOT to make errors in \'Canon". Too much of the early
material is out of print and nearly impossible to find. Continuous criticism,
too often of a detrimental nature, rather than a constructive nature, can only
serve to discourage the writing of new adventures and material for this game,
and IMHO the is a BAD thing.

I hope that IG gets their heads in the right spot. A game with a 20 year long
"history" needs a writers guide of some type! If only an outline of the older
material. I have just purchased the M:0 Campaign and find that a this book moves
well into that direction with it\'s background write up and timeline, but more is
needed! A reprint of Library Data, with the inclusion of material reflecting
data from the published adventures and supplements would be the way to go, I
believe.

Any way, thanks for your interest and comments.

From some correspondence about five years ago that I dug out, John F. Carr
and Roland Green, at that time were trying to get permission from Ace (who
were no longer interested in the series) to find a new publisher for
"Gunpowder God".  Carr commented that he thought that this would be

(before they moved offices, just after the \'94 L.A. quake) he said that

Back in my CT days (maybe 15+ years ago) I ran a short one night scenario
and with all the storytelling lately I thought I would try to resurrect my
sometimes failing memory and recant the tale.

- ----A Missing Man----
                                by Brian A. Howard

The player characters (party of four) were the command crew of a state of
the art TL 15+ starmerc cruiser. IIRC the ship was a 600 ton up-rated
version based on a patrol cruiser but of unique design and not of Imperial
manufacture. They had returned from a long voyage outside of the Imperium
around the time the Fifth Frontier War was drawing to a conclusion. Their
activities were not exactly sanctioned by any of the parties involved in
the war. I don\'t remember the world much except that it was in the Spinward
Marches, medium sized, moderate population, and otherwise unremarkable. 
	On about the second day of their stay on planet the group receives a ship
to shore message from a woman, Vicky Redman, who introduces herself as a
friend of Gloria Hecky, a female NPC engineer serving on the PCs ship, who
left on liberty several hours previously. Redman explains that Hecky was
supposed to meet her for a lunch date but never arrived. The group panics
as one of their trusted few was now missing and repeated calls on the
personal communicator each crewmember carried was met with silence. Redman
offers  local contacts to help with the search.
	Conventional legwork (and some tips from Redman\'s contacts) turn up two
suspects and an address to a flea bitten hotel on the edge of startown.
Naturally, the PC\'s grab their guns for a valiant SWAT type rescue attempt,
but not before Redman insists on attending the party. Hecky was her friend
after all, and the PC\'s owed her for the help.
	Storming the hotel room the PC\'s find a pathetic horror. The suspects are
half naked, sprawled out on the meager, broken-down furniture completely
strung-out on some mind altering narcotics while loud Mando Rock* blares
from a portable stereo. In a back room the group finds Hecky or rather her
body. She is found tied spread-eagle to the single bed, apparently dead of
asphyxiation. In a rage Redman grabs a pistol and shoots the suspects dead.
Fearful of police recriminations the group flees to their ship and prepares
a quick departure. On the way, Redman asks to join the crew. They are in
need of a new engineer for which she has some skill, and she needs a quick
departure for obvious reasons. Oddly, the local police never call before
they leave the planet.

And now for the challenge: What really happened?

My players never figured it out, but can any of you?

Email me privately with a solution or questions and the first one who
guesses right gets a cookie (guess I better make one, huh?)

*Mando Rock: a creation of my own warped mind, this style of music
incorporated heavy speed-steel guitar riffs superimposed over blues scores
often played on instruments ranging from the folk to the bizarre. The whole
effect was best enjoyed on narcotics. Some months after I ran this
scenario, I found a curious recording by a band named MandoRock!

Sincerely,

Brian A. Howard

Ah, the good ol\' daze. I remember back in the \'70\'s, I think it was the first
trav game I ever Reff\'ed, and I went a little overboard.

The situation involved a stolen ship with a prototype drive system that was
being "held" on an airless moon. The party was hired to recover the prototype.
In order to get them to the moon their employers gave them the use of an armed
penance, I think it had a missile launcher. They immediately painted it matte
black, (space camo!)

The idea was for them to get into this really neat battle, both ground and
space. Well the penance dropped the pc\'s, with the pilot remaining aboard.
Slowly the party creeped up to a position overlooking the prototype! I rubbed my
hands together thinking of the fun when the guards I had posted caught them, and
rolled, completely missing the roll! Then, form over the horizon came the
penance, launching a brase of missiles NEAR the prototype, and continuing on
over the opposite horizon! (It was a small moon).

While the guards stared after the penance, (which never even turned!), the party
ran toward the ship and slipped into the airlock, jamming it closed behind them.
Quickly they blasted the heck out of the two remaining personnel on the ship,
that were woefully under armed to handle the pack of blood thirsty so-and-so\'s
I\'d allowed to attack them. The rest of the guards were all stuck out of the
ship! The party was inside, watching as the original criminals slowly
asphyxiated, while calmly preparing to lift off! The penance was who knows
where, half way back to the planet!

They returned the prototype and bought the penance with a part of their reward,
which had made only the single run, then ran away before a shot could be fired
back. I insisted that the penance now had acquired a yellow strip down it\'s
spine! For over two years this same group played  Traveller off and on, using
that matte black penance with the yellow stripe to frighten little old ladies
and small children, it NEVER came closer than half a continent to a battle,
during the entire campaign. To this day I have a hand made miniature of that
penance on my shelf that it\'s pilot made and gave to me when we retired the
campaign!

The moral of this too long story? I underestimated the players in that first
game, but they ENJOYED it! It hooked them on Traveller, and we all had Fun!

I used to feel the same way as you do, but I\'ve adopted another
attitude.  Being constantly disappointed is not a way I want to live,
especially in reference to my favorite role playing game.


For me, Traveller is pick and choose.  There is wealth of items to pick
from out there.

In my campaign, I pull things from T4, CT, MT, and TNE.  Now that GURPS
is out (one of my players has a copy), I\'ve seen some things in it that
I may adopt for my game.

If I\'ve got four or five ways to design ship, that should be an
advantage (hey, I\'m trying here).

I look at it like this.  Recently, I\'ve been evaluating space combat
systems.  We\'ve got the one in the original CT books.  We\'ve got High
Guard.  And, we\'ve got Mayday.

Then, we\'ve got the MT space combat system from those original three
books.

Next, we\'ve got Brilliant Lances, Battle Rider, and the original BL like
system in the TNE main book.

Finally, there\'s this really neat RPSCS system.

Boy, that\'s a lot of choice for a game master.

And, you know what?  

Other games don\'t have that kind of choice. 

So, I\'m looking at it as a benefit for Traveller.

As far as the ship construction system for T4 goes, we\'ve got a lot of
choice in that too.  I would prefer something like a basic system, a
middle of the road system, and a specific-screw-nut-and-bolt system--all
backwardly compatible--like QSDS, SSDS, and FF&S2 were originally hoped
to be.

But, hey, that\'s not the case.  We\'ve got what we\'ve got.  The point
is--we do have a lot of choice that is not even possible in other game. 
You are basically stuck with one system, crappy or not, when you play
other RPG\'s.

I\'m all for constantly trying to make Traveller better, but I\'ve decided
to sit back, enjoy the hell out of my own campaign, and just use the
items I want without bothering about items that I don\'t think are worth
buying.

I was buying everything that IG put out as soon as it was put out.  Now,
I sit back and wait.  If I need it, I go and get it.

And as far as choice goes...in my campaign, it is a big universe out
there.  One planet may be using SSDS, while you go to another planet,
and you will get ships designed with FF&S2.

No big deal anymore.

Kenneth.

Help me brainstorm here.  What are the essential items for a starship?

Here\'s the things I\'ve come up with.  Keep in mind that I\'m looking for
a list of minimum requirements.  The players can always get extra stuff
if they want it:



1) Proper computer software.  I\'m using he CT computer rules with the
RPSCS.  It works like a charm, and is fun as hell.



2) Vac Suits:

Ship
7 Vac Suits--one for each crew member;  location is player designated
10 Emergency Vac Suits--one for each passenger;  location in staterooms
9 Emergency Vac Suits--one for each low berth passenger;  location in
low berth room
3 Emergency Vac Suits--one for each airlock;  location in each airlock
4 Emergency Vac Suits--one for each major hallway;  location in each
major hallway

Launch
1 Emergency Vac Suit--in airlock
1 Emergency Vac Suit--under pilot\'s chair
13 Emergency Vac Suits--for maximum passenger capacity

Total Vac Suits:  48



3) PLSS
Life support systems for each vac suit

Total PLSS\'s:  48



4) Secondary, emergency survival item.
This can be a survival bubble or rescue ball or some such other device. 
It\'s for the last ditch attempt.

48 items--located in the same locations as the vac suits above.



5) Small, one time use, Med kits

Ship
3 med kits--one in each airlock
13 med kits--one in each stateroom
4 med kits--one in each major hallway
1 med kit--bridge
1 med kit--lounge
1 med kit--galley
3 med kits--low berth room
1 med kit--engineering
2 med kits--cargo deck

Launch
1 med kit--airlock
1 med kit--for passengers

Total med kits:  31



6) Tools
1 set of Mechanical Tools
1 set of Electronic Tools



Can you think of things that would also be on this list?

There\'s also another trick used in some radars (or so I\'m told). You
send out pulses at differeent frequencies and at "irregular" intervals.
Both "channel" and timing are controlled by a pregenerated
psuedo-random number. Designed properly, such a system registers as
occasional loud static pulses (which get generated by some stars and
most gas gaints) rather than as a sensor signal.

You might call these "covert" active sensors. While it may take them
longer to be sure they have a valid return, the "pattern" of pulses
means that they don\'t have the "phantom range" problem that standard
radars have. 

That\'s where a pulse from a *long* ways off returns shortly after a
second (or even *third*) pulse has been sent out, and thus gets
interpreted as a return from the later pulse. Thus the reported range
is the real range minus c times the pulse rate. 

Due to the irregular pattern of the covert sensor, this can\'t happen.
It\'s looking for returns that match the pattern it sent out. This also
makes it a lot harder to spoof with false targets. 

Another anti-jamming trick is to have a regular radar that sends out
complex pulses (ie the waveform isn\'t a simple "pulse". If the returns
don\'t match the waveform, then you know that someone is trying to trick
you, and thus you can have all weapons ready while acting like an
innocent victim walking into the trap. :-)

Of course, the bad guys try to match your waveforms once they learn
about the trick, and from then on, it\'s a race between move subtle
pulse patterns, and jammers that can detect and match them. We are in
the early stages of this now. By M0, things should be *really*
interesting. 

But the "random pattern" radars will still be useful, as the whole idea
is to make them *look* like so much "noise".

I just sent back my copy of M0 campaign, as the new material did not add
enough for me to find it worth the purchase.  I would be very unhappy if
FF&S2 were to be completely invalidated as well, as I found it one of the
most useful supplements to come out, along with PE, CSC, and EA

Let me say that stronger: if Marc does not use FF&S2, OR A SIMPLIFIED
DERIVATIVE, I, too will be very tempted to eschew the new T4 supplements,
as I will not be able to trust that any of them will be read by anyone
other than the author once printed.  I want these books to be useful, like
the original black books were not invalidated by later supplements.

If Marc chooses to use a simplified version which gives exactly the same
results, like QSDS  was for FF&S, and use FF&S2 for the gearheads, then I
would be quite happy.  For this to work, the simplified system MUST be
derived from the complicated one in FF&S2.  There are plenty of people who
would be willing to do some of that work, I suspect, if they got
appropriate credits.

I am not pleased when my hard earned money is wasted on a supplement that
the game designers do not use for future products themselves, and IG has
already made me angry several times.  Marc - please do not do this with
FF&S 2.

I agree that actives are good for sensing the target and getting info about
it BUT how do you get around the r^2/r^4 difference? In order to keep up
with passives at the long ranges you have calculated detections will take
place they\'ll have to beef up the output power A LOT. If the acticves are
primarily used as trackers for laserfire why not use the lasers themselves
as actives? They\'re highpower, tightlobe and the reflections will be just
as dopplered etc as radars. Even misses will probably show up at close
range as the intensity isn\'t cut off totally outside the focussed area.

My feeling why most people want to keep actives is because they do not want
to play a realistic space combat but a Harpoon(tm) like naval action with a
black mapboard and playing pieces looking like starships but behaving like
surface ships except the fighters.

NEW CD-ROM WILL HELP TRAVELLERS AVOID TUMMY BUGS AND WORSE

The new "Traveller" Worldwide Health Information CD-ROM from Focus 77 is
based on information provided by the London Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
Updated monthly, the CD provides detailed information on individual
diseases, suggests preventative measures and warns of particularly
hazardous regions. Traveller supports single or multi centre travel.

Disease risks, including malaria, are given for all locations. All diseases
are checked, not just those with a vaccine. These include Dengue Fever,
Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia), leishmaniasis and Onchocerciasis (River
Blindness) etc.

Doctors, Practice and Clinic Nurses, Occupational Health Departments,
Pharmacists and Travel Industry Professionals will benefit from this unique
product.

For further information, please contact Focus 77 Ltd., 78-80 Akeman Street,
Tring, Hertfordshire, HP23 6AF. Telephone: +44 1442 828877 or Fax: +44 1442
828866. E-mail: traveller@focus77.u-net.com



OK, so it tickled my sense of humor (evidently rather feeble) regarding the
 much vaunted and long awaited Traveller CD.  However, it had other
interest for me (aside from the fact that I suffered at the hands of that
same London Hospital when I returned from the tropics with a whole
bunch of nice diseases for them to \'show off\' to med students).

Without wishing to start (or encourage) the whole Plague of Duskir thread
once again, has anyone considered disease and/or the treatment of it
in Traveller (excepting the JTAS article on the subject)?  Particularly with
regard to PCs?  I seem to recall having to botch together some old AD&D
rules on the subject but this was a long time back and my memory may
be at fault.

(Anyone want a brief write up of \'hezmaritosis\' - a curious  illness whose
only effect is giving you all the symptoms of drunkeness.  I got fed up
with goody-goody players avoiding drink just to avoid being drunk!!) [1]

Perhaps the PoD debate shows that something more concrete in the
way of \'rules\' are desperately needed.

Approx. 300.000 km/s, equalizing about 184000 miles/s if you do not use the

An AU, or astronomical unit, is the average distance between Earth and the
Sun, which is 149.6 Gm, or about eight light minutes (i.e. it takes light,
radio communication and such eight full minutes to travel that distance).

I can\'t really remember the details, but when they realised a couple of
years back that they needed to re-write their switch s/w to move to
object-oriented code (or was it to repair the first attempt at OO code?)
they wrote off something like 900 million dollars for doing it. Profits sure
looked bad that year...

I would dispute this to some degree. It\'s not at all uncommon for stuff to
be downgraded for civilian use where it might compromise military/government
interests. So there might well be a black market in upgrading civilian ROMs
to military versions. There could also be certain functions (such as
when-on-the-ground-don\'t-let-the-turret-fire-its-weapons interlocks that one
might well want to hack out).

For what its worth, I wholeheartedly agree.  I just purchased FFS2 a little
over a month or so ago.  I couldn\'t wait to get it.  I\'ve been playing with
it ever since.  I redesigned alot of the "core" ships in the T4 rules because
these designs were made up from of thin air.

I think that if Marc really _is_ planning on invalidating FFS2, it would just
be annoying and would muddle things even further than they are already.  Stop

Wait a minute...are you saying that FF&S2 will ALREADY be invalidated?? I\'m
sorry, but this is something I will not accept. FF&S2 has flaws, yes, but
the basic system is sound and should serve as the basis for any simpler
ship design systems. There should be a new version of QSDS in the new T4.1,
not an entirely new and no doubt incompatible design system. I will also be
ending my involvement with Traveller as a game system if this occurs.

One, high frequency=short wavelength
Two low freq=long wavelength.

So Bruce just said what you did above "resolution scales as
wavelength."

As for the range thing, wouldn\'t this be largely an atmospheric

long wave stuff (generally), so this might well be a "real world"

Again, I think that range limitations related to wavelength (optical
astronomers usually talk about wavelength, and radio guys talk about
frequency, but it\'s all the same) are based on propagation through
a dense medium.

Dear Ken and all,
 
It occurs to me that there might be some useful info to be gleaned from the
Merchant Marine and the Coast Guard about what is considered standard equipment
on merchant, motor, and sailing vessels (says the guy from an inland state -
even if Lake Superior is two hours north of here).
 
I also would expect that there would be lots of maintenance parts to consider,
replacements for filters, light-bulb equivalents, etc., etc.  Too much
handwaving about ultrasonic cleaners and Nevr-Fail lighttubes misses the point
that ships do have wear-and-tear, as well as richochets from gauss rifles, etc.
You might bundle these into a general maintenance pool, but you ought not
forget it.
 
In fact, you could even build a decent sub-plot around some of the things the
players have to do to keep the ship going.  "Dunbar resistor-pads?  Never use
\'em -- they fail too quickly.  I\'d rather have the T-1533\'s from Aillekushu.
Only problem is that the nearest distributor is, um, 7 parsecs aways.
Still....it\'ud be worth it..."

With good timebase and inertial nav you could even perhaps even use

sources for GURPS Traveller info of the unofficial variety,  which are:

	http://www.io.com/~ jlockett/RPG/Traveller (Jackson Downport; good site.)
	http://members.tripod.com/~TheShipyard/Imperium.htm (GURPS

	http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/articles/traveller2.html (David Summers
excellent article)

Other links are available from the Jackson Downport site, and more info is
available in the GURPSNet archive, which can be accessed from there. Note,
of course, that these are UNOFFICIAL, and will probably bear little
resemblance to what is published next year, but it\'s a good way to try out
the concept and see if Traveller in GURPS might be to your liking.

That was my attempt, Scott!!!  I meant "series" production.  Has anyone on

MT actually uses less fuel in its design system than all the others 
(T4/TNE/CT).  The jump fuel requirements for the other systems work out 
to be 10% of the ships volume X the jump value.  That means that a 100 
ton starship making a jump-2 will require 20 tons of fuel just for the 
jump.

I have to admit, I am not very fond of this idea at first glance.  Though
on the surface, it seems to be very practical, I think there are a number
of problems, mostly directed at the small ship traffic, that make it
unattractive.

How would the inspection process work?  By order of arrival?  So the
200 dTon Free Trader (carrying 80 tons of fertilizer) would not be bumped
in line by the 5000 dTon Liner (carrying 3 Barons, 18 multi-billionaires,
a tri-dee star, etc...)?  How about a no-name trader who has been trying
to establish a small route at a Oberlindes transfer station - how many
\'discrepencies\' would be found with their paperwork?  Is every ship
boarded, and inspected?  How much time would this take, especially when
you have the 5,000 dTon and 10,000 dTon ships arriving?  What happens to
ships that just need to transship through the system, do they have to sit
through the queue before they can re-fuel, or can they bypass this
process.

How about ship\'s that do not arrive in this area (\'Oops - misjump. Sorry
about that...)?  From what I\'ve interpreted from the list, precision
astrogation (i.e. pinpointing jump breakout) is... haphazard, at best.  So
is your queue position determined by when you check in with Orbital
Control, or by when you arrive at the checkpoint?  (Now that could be
interesting, a 2-G trader arrives out of position, but is racing the 1-G
trader to the inspector...both are carrying the same cargo, so first one
down gets a better price!)  But, I have to admit, the smugglers and
\'runners would love that - they would know where most of the custom patrol
ships would be stationed!

So far as de-activating ship\'s weaponry, well everyone knows that the
Imperial Navy keeps the peace in space.  It is not really necessary for
any ship, other than registered Mercenary Companies, to be armed.  Escorts
are always available for those few captains that are so alarmed by false
or misleading reports, that they feel uncertain about their ship\'s safety.
Only the government should have weapons, and they shall protect the
citizenry from all harm.

Riiiiiight...And a major trading company, which shall remain nameless,
doesn\'t actually keep a fully armed cruiser at the border...

At the very least, this would represent another delay  (waiting at the
Jump Point) while a O\'Guard technician re-enabled the ship\'s weaponry -
before you could leave.  And, or course, another \'health and welfare\'
inspection to be sure that all your paperwork is in order (while the
Tukera Lines ship, with the proper waivers, sails on by and jumps).

O.K., So the large trading companies (with thier large influence), would
like the setup too...

Also, while the piracy thread has mostly looked at the single pirate, let
us not forget that the Vargrs occasionally gift the Imperium with a fleet
of them!  Having all the shipping for a system nicely queued out at 100
diameters, right where they are popping in themselves, would be a very
tempting target.  And tactically, if I could drop mines in this designated
break-out area, it would be a week, minimum, before the incoming traffic
could be warned to shift targets.

In short, while this would be attractive to highly organized, high
law-level planets/systems, IMHO it would be detrimental to shipping
traffic overall.  The current system, in my campaign, of random
inspections is designed to keep smuggling/piracy within acceptable limits
while keeping the cost (both to the honest trader and to the responsible
agency) at a minimum.

In my setting, jump space is a misnomer. "Jump space" is not actually a
place where our four dimensional concepts of realspace make sense. A craft
going from one place to another without crossing the intervening distance
is "outside" of spacetime -- essentially a ship in jump is in its own
pocket universe, one you cannot leave.

Actually, the entire concept of jumps that take an amount of time to
complete goes against my own sense of elegance. Personally, I would much
prefer jumps that are instantaneous. This comes from a verrry limited
understanding of cosmology and a dislike for the obvious handwave of a jump
taking about one week (what a coincidence!). Unfortunately, this would kill
the "age of sail" feel of the Traveller universe, something that is also
unacceptable to me.

As if what I thought had any relevance to anyone but myself! :)

Anyway, one idea I toyed with was that jumps take the standard amount of
time from the viewpoint of the real universe, but are instantaneous from
the viewpoint of those on board the ship. In this case, the crew never gets
a chance to try and explore jump space, because time doesn\'t exist for them
when they are there (and thus, they can\'t do anything at all).

I have never run a game like this, and I wonder what the effect would be on
the crews of intersteller vessels (those weeks would add up, creating a
"twin brothers" problem of sorts).

All of this, of course, depends on how you want to play. I once ran a
heretical space opera Traveller campaign (complete with the supernatural)
where jump space was actually the astral plane (of AD&D fame). Amazingly
enough, according to one AD&D source, it takes about a week to travel from
one distant place to another on the astral plane, regardless of the actual
intravening distance. What a coincidence! ;)

Yes, there are.  I am willing to produce such a system (updating QSDS for
FF&S2 would not be that difficult, provided I had enough lead time and
permission to conduct an extended playtest), and I know of at least one
other group that would be willing to commit to that sort of effort.

Without support from IG and Marc, however, this can\'t happen.  In short,
there are people standing by who are willing to do the work, if IG and/or
Marc gives the word (if nothing else, we\'ll need to know what the T4.1 space
combat system will look like).

Specifically calculating the damage for weapons of 30,000 joules or greater.

Lets take an example of weapon with a energy delivery of 30,000 joules

30,000/1,000,000 = 0.03 MJoules

PVbase = 16
MODpv  = 7

Emuzzle = Ebase due to no enhancements due to barrel length, etc.

16 + 7 * (0.03-0.03) = 0

10% of 0 = 0

For long range I use either 45 or 45%whichever is less) Ok 45% it is

Allen,

I think that Marc was developing TNAS before FFS2 was released, he may not
have had time to integrate FFS2\'s data values into his TNAS. I hope.

Wrong.  You got all the hard stuff right, then made an "Aunt Sally" mistake.

You perform the multiplication first, then the addition.  Thus:

Damage = PVbase + MODpv * (Emuzzle - Ebase)
Damage = 16     + 7     * (0.03    - 0.03)
Damage = 16     + 7     * (0)
Damage = 16     + 0
Damage = 16

You do the subtraction in parentheses first, then the multiplication, and
then the addition.  You specifically do NOT add 16+7 and THEN multiply by
zero.

The rule is:
1) Perform operations in parentheses first, then
2) Perform any exponentiation (squares, square roots, etc), then
3) Multiplication and division (in order from left to right), then
4) Additiona and subtraction (in order from left to right).

This is sixth-grade math stuff.  However, most of us have forgotten all about
sixth grade (at least, I TRY to - the frogs were _not_my_fault_), so there\'s
a little mnemonic you can use to remember this: "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt
Sally" for Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication and Division, Addition
and Subtraction

FF&S2 was targetted at a high-school math level, and doesn\'t explicitly say
this (though maybe it should have), because the reader is assumed to know
it.

Nik,

   Having lectured for the public night sessions at the University of
Denver, here in Colorado (one mile nearer the stars as we say), I have
some experience with the confusion between \'astrological\' and \'astronomical\'
and I never miss out on an opportunity to further educate the public.

   Often times, not being so close to something as \'we\' are in a field,
we lose sight of the fact that we are more sensitized to some things than
those more casually involved.  I think it _is_ safe to say that we are
fortunate that the writers of our fine game don\'t ask, "Well, those planets
up there, how did we find out there names."  Then I would say we have
cause for concern.

   Fortunately, I really doubt that we have to worry all that much.
Thanks for copying me offline with your comments as my machine is down at
home, so right now, most of my digests are adding up on floppy diskettes.

    'body' => '> Rules Mix:          80% T4, 20% CT, MT, TNE, and assorted house rules

I\'ve enjoyed reading over these "Live Campaign" posts, and one thing has intrigued me.  
There are a heck of a lot more people out there using T4 rules than the
pulse of he TML has shown.

I thought I was in the minority, since so many have complained that the
simplicity of T4,  But, by looking at these posts, clearly T4 rules are
used by more people--at least from those who have posted.

That\'s good news for the health of the game from where I\'m sitting.

Of course, nobody is using T4 straight, and I wondered about this.  When
I run other games, I usually only use the rules in that rules system.

In D&D, I only use D&D rules.  In Star Trek, I only use Star Trek rules.

I\'m seeing that in Traveller rules too, except most other games don\'t
have 4 editions!

I know D&D had three editions--Basic, Advanced, and Second Edition
Advanced.  Star Wars had a little known about three editions, although
they only claimed to have two--there was the original Star Wars rules,
then there was an improved version right after the game came out kinda
like T4.1, and then they released the Second Edition.

What am I getting to here with all this dribble?

It\'s the thought that it looks like most Traveller games today are based
on T4 and use those rules for 70-80% of their rules.  Then, from the
other three editions, certain things are pulled for another 20-30%. And
finally, there\'s the house rules that any self-respecting GM will have
(I know I\'ve made some for any game I\'ve played at any length of time).

My perception used to be that only bits and pieces of T4 were used by
the majority of T4 players, with healthy does of the games other
editions thrown in.

I\'m glad to see, at least unofficially by this poll, that I\'m wrong
about that.

T4 rules are alive and well within the Traveller gaming community.  

We\'ve got 20 years of Traveller material from four other editions!  It
would be a waste to not include some of those rules in our games.  After
all, they are Traveller, and it is not like pulling from another game
(which, of course, is done).

That makes me feel much better about T4 rules and the health of the game
at whole.

After you\'ve read the umpteenth post about T4 doom (some of my previous
posts included), you start to believe it.

I think T4 is alive and well.

And, I\'m not just saying that.

The Jump-field contains a bit of normal space within a few meters or so
of the ship\'s hull, anything that drifts beyond that gets irretrevably
lost. Either by having atom by atom dispersed across the universe as it
crosses the jumpfield boundry, or by having the object "misjump" and
precipitate randomly into normal space.

In either case, if the object is living, it won\'t be for much longer.
And no, it doesn\'t appear next to the ship when it enters normalspace
unless it is tethered to the ship within that few meters. If it is
thrown out an airlock, it continues in motion (Newton\'s laws still apply
within those few meters) until it contacts the jumpspace boundry --

I have been collecting and compiling a quasi-canonical pseodo-scientific
handwave for the miracle of jump travel. I\'m still in the "process of
editing" (read: haven\'t had time to finish) and so I haven\'t posted a
final version yet. [my poor languishing website is due for an update]

For now, though, you might want to check out my Jumpspace FAQ, an
attempt to answer frequently asked questions regarding jumpspace, using
previous Traveller material. It tries to be as close to "canon" as
possible. See the following URL:

Well, you still have ships just plain jumping in someplace
other than they intended.  You also could have a ship posing
a merchant until the patrol pulls up and then launching a
suprise attack (which is why you need to have multiple ships
of decent size).  However, the main question is, is it worth
the fuel.   There is an optimum place to jump from for each planet,
and, if you have carefulling arranged to have your velocity
vector favorably alligned as you come out of jump, having to
stop and be inspected is also a waste of fuel.  Given how
small the actual loses due to priracy are, I\'m not sure it
would be seen as worth it.

It depends.  If one in 10,000 ships looses a cargo to piracy
then it may not be.  And in fact, piracy is never seen as
more than an occaisonal problem in Traveller (except for
organised piracy/raiding from the Extents which are another
ball of wax).

Sure, I agree that Piracy around Regina won\'t happen.  But
when you start talking about doing this on all those other
worlds in situations where you do have to take away from
planetary defenses, it\'s another story.

So you think that piracy might occur around a Gas Giant?

I don\'t agree.  You yourself point out the problem with splitting
defense.  As far as the Zhos go, Regina is in the middle of
a huge bull\'s eye.  They aren\'t going to be dispersing forces
to backwater worlds casually.

They don\'t like a lot of things.  They also don\'t like smuggling,
but they don\'t dislike it so bad as to have 10 people search
every ship after every jump from top to bottom.

between his House and House Jade.  Then, disater struck when House Jade
merged with House London to become the largest House on the planet.

The Jadist utterly destroyed House Praygor about a year ago.  Vaan\'s
father was killed, making Vaan an Imperial Baron.  Now, he\'s on the run
from the Jadist\'s, hopping from planet to planet (can\'t stay anywhere
too long!) in a little merchant vessels--The March Harrier.

Given this, you can see my player\'s comments are in character.

Here\'s Praygor\'s take on the "Mystery Challenge".

Actually, the story behind that story is that Piper originally
wrote it the way it appears in "Federation".  His editor at the
time, John Campbell, had some problems with the concept of
parallel evolution, and suggested that he (Piper) rewrite it to
fit in with "that paratime series we did a while back".  So,
"When in the Course" isn\'t a modified "Lord Kalvan" story, "Lord
Kalvan of Otherwhen" is a rewrite of "When in the Course".

No, the Pt/Ir alloy was the Standard Metre.  The Standard
Kilogramme is pure Pt.

I believe that right now, the kilogramme is defined in terms of
Atomic Mass Units, one of which is exactly one-twelfth of the
weight of a C12 nucleus.

Currently, I believe that all Standard Units are defined in terms
of reproducible experiments - the metre is defined in terms of
wavelengths of light produced under specific circumstances (an
electron transition), the second is defined in terms of the meter
(that time in which light travels 299..... metres), the
kilogramme in terms of atomic mass units, and so on.  Most of the

"odd" values of the current definitions are simply so that they
remain compatible with the values developed using less precise
and less reproduceable methods - it would certainly be easy
enough to define the "metre" to be some power of ten times the
wavelenghth of the light emitted by a particular electron
transition, and the "second" as some power of ten times the
amount of time needed for light in vacuum to travel one "meter",
and so on, but that would result in scientific units that are
divorced from experience.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but
psychologically unsatisfying, which is why it hasn\'t happened.

Sounds a lot like the jumpspace I imagine. It\'s just that "jumpspace"
sounds a lot nicer than "jump-not-really-space-per-se".

In my Traveller universe, jumps *are* instantaneous. It just takes a
week to get out of that "pocket universe" which we call jumpspace. My
personal favourite handwave for why it takes a week to "precipitate"
into normal space is the following:

The reaction which creates the jumpspace field which allows the starship
to enter jumpspace cannot be stopped once it has begun. It\'s a terribly
energetic reaction coursing through the lanthanum grid, it is difficult
to control, and impossible to stop. As long as this reaction continues,
the ship remains in that "alternate universe" which we call "jumpspace".
Only when the reaction is complete will the ship precipitate into normal
space.

Centuries of Jump drive design have tuned materials and methods to the
point where a controlled jump-grid discharge can be accomplished in one
week +/- 10%, so therefore that\'s how long jumps take. Equations
required for controlled jumps beyond 6 parsecs have proven, thus far,
impossible to solve.

To me, the reasons why a jump takes a week are pretty irrelevant. A
suitable pseudo-theory can be handwaved into existence. What *is*
important, is that it *does* take a week. That\'s a pretty important
cornerstone of Traveller history and interstellar society.

It\'s an interesting varient, it\'s been mentioned before, but it\'s
totally unlike the Traveller universe as published. Trips are supposed
to be leisurely, pleasure cruises, not unlike cruise ships today, where
all kinds of intrigue and hank-panky can take place for that week
outside the normal universe.

Jumps aren\'t supposed to be "step in an elevator, and press \'Rhylanor.\'"
Why would ships have staterooms in that case? Boooooriiiinggg

I\'m still toying with the idea that jumpspace is related to the "astral
plane" concept, and may even be the medium through which different forms
of psionics (clarivoyance, teleportation, etc.) operates. Why not?

good travelling!

[No spoilers]

I read it a couple of months ago in review-paperback. We\'ve been discussing
it on the CJ Cherryh List for some time (jaymin@maths.tcd.ie). Certainly, I
would advocate buying it. I have always found Cherryh\'s books to be
particularly relevant to Traveller. Finity\'s End is more so than most.

It concerns the operation of the merchant ship "Finity\'s End". For those
not familiar with the background, it is a independant merchant ship in the
large end of the scale. We get a good understanding of the day-to-day life
of a merchant ship both in space and on the docks. We gain an insight into
the business end (although perhaps not so much as in Tripoint), but most
particularly the society of merchanters.

Much of the background tension in the book comes from trying to balance the
interests of the large government subsidised liners against the small
independants. The small independants are drifting toward smuggling and
guerrilla support because of the higher profitability and higher jump level
of the subsidised liners.

There is also good material on low-tech aliens existing within a high-tech
human society.

For Cherryh fans, this is a must-have. For Traveller fans, get it from the
library or wait for the paperback.

Cheers,
Jo

Victor,

Good thoughts!  (although you need to adjust the lines on your posts!)

TNE went into some detail about maintenance aboard a starship.  Costs
are figured into regular charges like lifesupport, etc.  But, there was
a roll for a ship\'s maintence.  I don\'t remember how it worked, but I
think each ship had a maintenance number.  This was rolled (or less)
each week, or each time the ship jumps.  Missing the roll meant the ship
needed maintenance, and something broke.

Also, IIRC, each ship had a dedicated number of hours that maintenance
must be performed on the ship each week.  I think the 400 ton subsidized
merchant required 180 hours worth of work--which tells you what every
body is doing on the ship during jump!

I may pull out these TNE rules and use them in my game, but this is
different from what I was looking for in the Port Authority Checklist.

I\'m trying to put together a list of specific equipment, from the
equipment listings in each editon of Traveller, that the characters need
to buy as a minimum to keep the ship running.

Things like vacc suits are a necessity.  There\'s got to be requirements,
like how many life preservers a water vessel must have, for space
vessels.

I\'m trying to detail the ship, equipment wise.

Kenneth.

In my game, once you get outside the field generated by the jump grid, JS
eats you.  What it does with you after that is up to DM whimsy, but I start
out assuming that it is about as friendly an environment as the accretion
disk around a small black hole.

From my own understanding, it seems reasonable.  There is no requirement
that the coordinate systems of the ship and the universe match up once they
reconnect in normal space.  Now if you are using some kind of ER bridge,
where the ship never left normal spacetime, then the objection stands.

Just use something like an Alderson drive a la "Mote in God\'s Eye", where
you spend a significant time puttering around in normal space, but no time
in jump.

Cool!

This is what I wanted to hear.  FF&S seemed solid, and I wanted to be sure
that it would stay valid.   I will now go back into my cave to design
subsector maps.

One thing that I would really like to see at some point is a ship design
system based around "wrap something around the mission package."  This
should be derived from FF&S2, and a few assumptions.  This is not a new
system, so much as a different way of presenting the data in the old
system, to make it easier to design that naval vessel with the 18 inch
guns, er, I mean 10TW meson beam.

To do this would mean find some way to overestimate, but not terribly, how
many crew members re needed for a given amount of power plant and a given
amount of jump drive.  Then, determine the space, power, and other needs of
the mission package, and multiply by a factor.

Example:

"The type S meson cannon is 10000t.  It requires 7000MW.  At TL 15, this
means 1000 M^3 of fusion plant, and 3 engineers.  Their bunks are in the
standard 16 stateroom package, which also holds the weaponry crew, the
maintenance crew, and 12/50th of the doctor needed for the crew of this
weapon (ick!)

"The total size of the weapon package is 10350t, and it produces a power
surplus of 7000MW when not operating, and has no extra staterooms under
normal circumstances.

To build a ship around this weapon, use Chart 1 for the multiplier for
thruster drives, Chart 2 for the multiplier for jump drives, and Chart 3
for the hull size multiplier."

To do this, we would need to work backwards, to figure the amount of life
support, C3I, staterooms, screens, and other junk a given hunk of stuff
requires, and then a set of multipliers by tech level for the various
drives, hull, and other goodies.

Is there any interest in working the FF&S numbers backwards in this way?

Same here.  I\'d like the info, but I already have M0 and First Survey.

When the great M0 debate was taking place, many of us were pleading with
IG to let us--first purchasers of M0 and FS--have this info for free.

Or maybe even a small charge.  I\'d glady pay for the 30 or so pages,
photocopied even.

How about it Marc?  Will you take care of your customers who rushed out
and bought first printings of FS and M0?

	my hotest story made Lutz on the "Mother Ship" :

	two of the crew (player and npc\'s) got caught by Norman
	when they tried to sneak into the sensor lines of the Archer,
	and degraded for "adopted Children" to the "Oiks" status.
	Lutz playing a priest of holy Leibowitz, had while living
	with the Oinks (where he tried to improve sanitary education,
	and health ;-) still free movement anywhere on the ship
	because he hade good relations to the different robots, as
	he came free will from his world as "present" of its starport.

	now Stephan was worring about the next battle, and that the
	Oinks dont have vac-suites (unlike the children), so he asked
	Lutz if he could manage to get his vac-suite to the Oinks quaters.
	Lutz replied, that he would do it, if Stephon would become a
	member of his church. Just a short ceremony in 2 hours at church
	meeting and lunch. Stephan sayed "OK". And Lutz had his ceremony.

	Lutz words (badly remebemered, and translated)

		And now I enlight Stephan to apprentice ship of the
		church of holy Leibowitz as the master of the chair.

	he placed his chair behind Stephans chair, and took his pocket
	spotlight and placed it behind Stephans head. As we played this
	in the nearly dark kitchen (the living room was claimed to be
	under mothers watching) it was a quite impressive ritual of
	his religion as a technical priest.

   True enough.  While I use the TNE game mechanics (with very slight
mods), I am not above borrowing from other sources if they can be
adapted easily to my game.

   Well it is *if* you can find your own consistent method and rules for
design.  Problem gets to be when you decide to share your designs
outside your own gaming group.  A real "Tower of Babel" scenario has
been set up.

   So far as I\'ve been able to determine here is the Traveller sequence
of design systems:

   1) Book 2

   2) High Guard/TCS (HG was compatible with B2, in fact drive systems
in 
      B2 could be used in HG ships; TCS merely amplified HG--it wasn\'t a 
      seperate system)

   3) MegaTraveller (plus all the mods necessary because of errata)

   4) Brilliant Lances/FF&S I (the design sequence in both gives identical 
      ships; Battlerider used the same system, just a different method of 
      evaluating ships)

   Under Marc Miller\'s Traveller, we have had:

   1) Whatever was used to create the vessels in Starships

   2) QSDS/SSDS

   3) FF&S II

   4) The new system proposed by Marc Miller for MMT 4.1

   It would be had all of the above systems been compatible with each
other to some degree.  Unfortunately, some are "sort of" compatible, and
others are not compatible at all.

   Welcome!  You\'ve just joined the ranks of the Traveller Sanity Club. 
I completed the 12 Step Program myself back in 1996.  You\'ll find now
that you have more cash to buy things like minatures for your campaign,
you\'ll sleep better at night not worrying about the financial health of
the current game manufacturer, and you\'ll have time to do the important
things in life, like defend Traveller canon.  :-)

Kenneth,

Thanks for the kind words. It\'s pleasant to hear someone agrre with a ruling
rather than try to argue a work -around (I have couple of guys that can make a
Ref\'s head spin! ... of course I can be that way too, when I\'m on the other side
of the table ;). If your player is really interested in improving the defences of
his ship I\'d recommend looking into some good point defense systems, nuclear
dampers, etc. Of  course then he also has to look at his Power Plant. But I won\'t
mention it to him, I like watching the gears turn when a player wrestles with an
idea!.

I had thought of that, but the ability for an xboat to come out of
jumpspace and send info to the next lets the exchange of information happen
pretty rapidly. For instance, I liked the idea that news of the emperor\'s
assassination didn\'t reach the Spinward Marches until months after it had
actually happened. Quick jumps would deep-six that idea.

Still, increasing the safe jump point, say to a few AU out from the largest
mass in the system (i.e., the main star), would slow traffic down a bit. It
just wouldn\'t slow the exchange of information all that much.

If you have to travel from a long way out in normal space, you\'ll need
those staterooms. And I imagine there would be plenty of time for on-board
stuff.

It\'s just that darned information-exchange thing!

Thanks.Here\'s one more short one that the list might find a bit humorous. It
happened about 3-4 games after the first story, and I was determined to get a
little pay back from the players.

They reached a planet somewhere in the Marches, I don\'t remember which, but it had
a tech level of about 8 or so. The game started out interestingly enough, a new
player came into the game and they met him in an interesting way.

After procuring hanger space for the penance, (hauling that thing from planet to
planet was just starting to take a real bite out of their pocket books, but they
did not have a star ship among the group...yet.), they had tried to pass through
customs, carrying everything they owned. That included some rather lethal hardware
that the local law frowned upon. This little slip landed them in the local holding
tank while the LAW checked out their backgrounds. That\'s where they met Glen, who
was a wealthy fourth son of a noble that had gotten a little to intoxicated the
night before.

Anyway they were finally let out after a nights free lodging, without their
weapons. They also had to pay a healthy fine for trying to \'import\' contraband,
(yes, they carried THAT MUCH!), so they were looking for a way to make some quick
money.

They were approached by a group representing a small village well away from the
population centers around the star port, where I played a little loose with the
law level, ruling that the listed level pertained primarily to the urban areas.
These villagers were looking for some help against an armed band that was
extorting money from them. The players should have thought it through a bit but
didn\'t and agreed to help free the villagers from their oppressors.

So the first thing they needed was weapons. Now I knew these players, and two of
them were real die hard war gamers that just tolerated the RPG stuff while waiting
for the next Panzerfest. So I conned them a bit.

When they managed to locate a local, ah procurement agent, he just happened to
have a COUPLE of light APC\'s in stock, basically wheeled ATV\'s with a light cannon
on top. They couldn\'t resist, spending most of the upfront money that the
villagers had paid them to buy the APC\'s and a "few" hand weapons. Late that night
they managed to smuggle them out of the city and made their way to the village,
about two days distant. The penance pilot remained behind to bring it forward in
and provide "air support" when the planned attack was to happen

They loaded a half dozen or so fighters onboard (village NPC\'s) and stormed the
walled fortress the oppressor was using for a headquarters. A fast and furious
battle ensued, which they, of course, won.
About then the penance showed up, (convieniantly AFTER the fighting) with some
news he had gathered while still in the city.

It seems that the oppressor in question, that they had just killed, along with his
men, was really the .....LOCAL TAX COLLECTOR!

So here they sat having just murdered a local official with only a little time to
figure out how to escape. It was then that Glen spoke up saying that he owned a
star ship, sitting on the pad back at the star port. Quickly Glen and Gary, the
penance pilot set out to retrieve the ship for a get away. In the mean time Mike
and Lou (the wargamers) asked about the ship Glen had, in particular whither their
new toys (the APCs) would fit in the cargo hold.

Well, I said, They could fit any two of the three vehicles, penance, or the two
APCs. Since the penance would be loaded aboard when it reached them, that left
room for...one APC.

An evil light came into their eyes, at about the same moment, and they reached for
their dice. For the next half hour or so I sat back and called out to-hit numbers
as the two APCs sat across a court yard from each other and pounded each other to
mush!

When Glen\'s ship arrived ant the non-combatant members of the party were inboard
Mike and Lou still continued to fire on each other. Each was intent that his APC
would be the one to go. By the time they were done, both bleeding a crippled
character was dragged out of a smoldering wreak and forcibly carried inboard. They
launched just as the government troops approached.

The moral this time? Greed can be used without turning a game into dungeon crawl.
Both players were only half interested in RAG, but both spoke about this as one of
THEIR most memorable game for, literally. years. Yet they walked away with nothing
to show for their efforts.

Sorry for the long story again, (but this thread is bringing back such really GOOD
memories, and it beats another PoD epic!)

Another interesting twist could be a parasite that attaches itself to the ship 
hull in normal space and is mutated by the \'jump\' process.  You then have a 
one-week Alien episode while the crew battles this trouble while in \'jump\'.

Who knows what happens to the parasite if it goes back into \'normal\' space.


You could even have jumpspace link different dimensions, universes, etc...

Jump sounds like an opportunity for RP :)

	Well, that certainly sounds relieving. If you need some help "simplifying"
FF&S2 or decoding the mishmash that resulted when a draft got printed, I\'m
certainly willing to help clarify things.

   Not exactly.  Flying above terrain features would be a quick way to
assure that you will be going home in a body bag (or at least walking
home).

   Why?  Because you present yourself as a clear target to every bad guy
within weapons range.  While terrain would not be as much of an obstacle
as it was in the past (you still have to get all those battledress
equipped infantry to the other side of the river and battledress doesn\'t
float), having lots of woods, hills, and similar features around to hide
behind or in would be a good idea.

   Think helicopter tactics...

Yes, you are right.  I was a true crusader there for a while.  This new
Traveller game was out.  I was hooked up to this list, and I was going
to do whatever I could to help make this version of Traveller the best
it had ever been.

....no, it was more than that.  I was going to do whatever it took to
from this end of the playing field to make T4 the best RPG EVER!

I\'ve given up on that.

Now, I am just enjoying my game.

IG will make good items, and they will make bad.  It is the way it goes.

I\'m not worrying about it anymore.

.....funny....I feel more relaxed now....

Long before you reach that point, the stresses on the structural
members will exceed those supportable by any known material. Consider
that by the time you have even 1/10th gee, you\'ll have the weight of
miles (probably *thousands* of miles) of structure pressing down on the
center of the ship.

Under those kinds of pressure, even things like diamond flow.

Unfortunately, natural law takes precedence. Figure the difference
between maximum and minimum jump duration. Then figure out how far the
planet moves in its orbit in that much time. *That* is the spread of
arrivals. (Hint, at 30 km/sec orbital velocity, a planet moves 108,000
in an hour). 

So your "arrival sphere" is going to be *bigger* than the 100 diameter
sphere of the planet!

This is almost certainly due to atmospheric absorption. The higher
radar frequencies are right in the middle of a *major* absorption band
for air. In space, this won\'t apply.

Indeed (without the wickeds).  The mometum of a photon is given by 

    p = E/c, 

where E is the energy of the photon, and so the thrust delivered by a
stream of them is

    dp/dt = dE/dt/c

or

    F = P/c, 

where F is the thrust and P is the power.  To get a thrust of 1 N, you
need a power of 300 MW.  Yes, three hundred megawatts.

But under ideal conditions, as you say, a photon drive would be the most
efficient drive possible.  There are, however, a lot of ideals in there.

I like this idea and would be very interested.  I could be involved in such a

Specifications

     The ISBA (and the Third Imperium) step aside this month, and a
     hard-pressed pocket empire somewhere on the fringes of Imperial
     space takes center stage...
     
   [Excerpted from an official document released to Kaneshi shipbuilding
   concerns by the Kanesh Chartered Guild of Shipwrights (KCGS), local
   date Makan IV:33 Upper (Imperial 117-23). The document carried the
   Autarch\'s personal seal.] 
   
   Brave companions in our shared triumph!
   
   We, the Council of Nine of the Shipwright\'s Guild, salute you! Your
   perseverence and dedication, your ceaseless toil on behalf of our
   beloved Empire, are the shield and the sword which stand between our
   precious realm and the barbarians beyond, eager to tear down all we
   have built, all we hold most dear.
   
   [19k omitted.] 
   
   Thus, at the personal command of our beloved Autarch Zomaiir III, we
   request your proposals for a vessel meeting the following
   requirements.
   
   The vessel will form the cornerstone of permanent in-system defense in
   the key systems of our Empire. Its size must be in the range 500 to
   1000 displacement tons, and it should not be jump-capable. It must be
   capable of independent and covert \'guerrilla\' operation (e.g., lurking
   in a gas giant\'s atmosphere and pouncing on refueling vessels); it
   must also have superior sensor capabilities in order to serve in an
   \'early warning\' picket role. Maneuver capability and armaments should
   be consistent with the vessel\'s role as a last line of defense against
   invading fleets.
   
   All components must be of Kaneshi manufacture, in order to ensure
   spare parts are available locally in the event of war.
   
   [The Kaneshi Empire is at TL 10.] 
   
   Noble colleagues, skilled shipwrights, honored citizens of our Empire
   -- heed our Autarch\'s call! The rewards of success will be great.
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   Welcome to THUDDD meets Pocket Empires. Keep in mind that the primary
   concern of the Autarch is price...Kanesh is not a rich PE, and
   squeezing maximum bang out of minimum bucks is the key to winning this
   contract. To this end, each contestant should list how many vessels of
   the proposed design can be purchased for 10 gigacredits -- include
   this value with the \'header\' design data. If you can credibly provide
   peacetime roles for the design (e.g., Coast Guard-like duties,
   in-system transports, or whatever), all the better...but the primary
   mission is detecting and destroying invading starships, and nothing
   else should interfere with this.
   
   FFS2 will be a valid design system for this THUDDD, along with all the
   earlier systems. Judges should take into account differences
   (especially in sensor performance) between FFS2 and the earlier
   systems.

   16 ARCHERS can be bought for 10 billion credits. This will leave 296
   million credits left over. It is suggested that these be used to
   purchase long range AEMS to be placed on the main homeworld, to
   provide better sensor coverage of the system.
   
   If the Kaneshi Empire is forced into a fight with the Imperium, it
   will lose. There is no way that one small world can hope to defeat the
   combined might of hundreds of worlds with higher tech level weapons
   and ships. If the Kaneshi Empire is to survive it has to make the
   possibility of a fight with the Imperium so costly that the Imperium
   will choose to ignore the Kaneshi Empire and go find someone weaker to
   pick on. The Archer will make the battle costly to the Imperium, by
   destroying their large capital ships.
   
   Initial intelligence suggests that Imperial forces consist of 10,000
   to 25,000 ton ships escorted by the highly touted Imperial Fighters.
   While Imperial Fighters do cost significant amounts, to discourage
   Imperial attack, their capital ships have to be in danger. The Archer
   SDB was developed to do this.
   
   The Archer was given 5 of the biggest laser cannons, that the Kaneshi
   Empire can build, to save money these lasers were made to be
   non-steerable. These lasers are over 8meters in diameter and fire 100
   500Mj laser pulses per half hour. (in game terms ROF=100) These lasers
   are controlled by a state of the art Master Fire Director. Only one
   MFD was chosen, both because MFDs are very expensive and also the
   tactic behind the Archer is for it to close with the enemy and to
   concentrate all of its firepower on the capital ships of the enemy
   fleet. Fighters and escorts will be ignored until the capital ships
   are destroyed. To protect the Archer against the fire from the
   Fighters, the ship was given a thick armored hull, it was also given 7
   sandcaster turrets. These sandcasters can protect the ship against the
   laser stings of fighters, as well as the capital ship\'s PAW spinal
   mounts. In addition 5 point defense lasers are mounted, these can
   shoot down incoming missiles, and any fighters that are in range. Also
   200 AEMS decoys and 200 PEMS decoys are installed, these can reduce
   the chance of a sensor lock on by a hostile craft. EMM was looked at
   but the 70 MCr price tag was thought to be too expensive.
   
   The Archer\'s laser cannons should outrange or at the worst be equal to
   many of the weapons, found on Imperial ships. (The TL-12 Meson guns
   found in Starships only range up to 40 hexes, while the Archer\'s laser
   ranges out to 80 hexes. The only meson guns capable of doing
   significant damage at 80 hexes are extremely big, especially at TL-12)
   The typical turret laser, while being able to reach 80 hexes, will be
   unable to penetrate the Archer\'s armor plating at those ranges.)
   
   While the laser lances of the Archer are a powerful weapon, the Archer
   is two tech levels behind that of their Imperial foes. This does
   effect the design, the Archer can only accelerate at 1G, this will
   allow the Imperial forces to dictate the range at which the combat is
   fought. While this is unfortunate, it is not fatal, because of the
   long range of the Archer\'s laser lance. Many of the systems are not as
   effective as their TL-12, which means that TL-12 ships will be able to
   put more and better equipment in their ships.
   
   The ship has a AEMS with a short range of 300,000km, and a PEMS with a
   short range of 120,000 km. A bigger PEMS would have been useful, but
   it would have required a folding array, and the prices of folding
   arrays are much too high. The ship will probably be easily found by
   the Imperials TL-12 sensors, so once it is found it will probably turn
   on its AEMS sensor to allow it to fire at the enemy.
   
   Many weapon systems were looked at while designing the Archer. The
   three major weapon systems are spinal PAWS, missile bays and large
   lasers. Missiles are the most effective weapon at TL-10, but they are
   extremely expensive. A 1000 ship can easily carry 100-200 ton missile
   bay capable of firing a huge missile volley. Missile bays are very
   cheap, but missiles require a MFD for each 3 missiles fire, as each
   MFD costs about 50 MCr the price for the ship would sky rocket. Adding
   still more expense the missiles cost just under a million credits
   each. As the Kaneshi Empire desires an effective yet inexpensive ship,
   missiles were not selected. It was felt that large laser lances can do
   more damage, with better penetration than PAWS, so linked laser lances
   were selected.
   
   The ship is egg shaped, the laser lances are mounted around the
   pointed end of the egg, while the HEPlaR engines point out the fat end
   of the egg. The sandcasters and point defense lasers are mounted
   evenly around the middle of the egg. Most of the fuel, is mounted
   directly behind the armor, to act as extra protection. The bridge and
   engine room are located in the center of the ship. It was felt that
   the most essential systems should be put behind as many barriers as
   possible.
   
   The ship has an extensive electronics suite, it has 2 laser
   communicators, one maser communicator and a broadband radio receiver
   and transmitter, all with a range of 1000AU. This will allow the ship
   to communicate with all friendly forces in the area, and to hail
   potentially hostile ships. It has two state of the art military grade
   fiber optic computers, these are more than capable of meeting the
   computing needs of the ship.
   
   Inside the ship is fairly spartan. Pipes and wiring weren\'t hidden
   behind false panels, as that makes damage control more difficult. The
   ship is fairly cramped, the captain gets a single, as it he is
   expected to use it as an office as well as a stateroom. The rest of
   the command staff double bunks as well as most of the crew. The
   engineering staff are forced to triple bunk. The ship does have an
   extensive video library, and several video game stations. This allows
   the crew to have some recreation, but most of the time they are on
   duty, ever vigilant to the Imperial threat.

   His Majesty\'s Royal Shipwrights College is proud to present the
   Darkstar-class System Defense Boat. While the Royal Shipwrights
   College is not one of His Majesty\'s many qualified ship yards, we
   believe that this ship design represents the cutting edge of
   spacecraft technology and a magnificient return on His Majesty\'s wise
   contribution to the College endowment.
   
    Notes:
    
   The Darkstar is equipped with extended life support capable of
   maintaining atmosphere and water indefinitely. It carries 3 months of
   normal rations and 2 weeks emergency rations. It is equipped with a
   galley, two gyms, and both machine and electronic shops. The low
   berths are emergency berths for casualties. The Fuel Shuttle can
   completely refuel the Darkstar in 11 hours. Additional crew is carried
   so that sensor and engineering stations can stay at Alert status at
   all times to maintain sensor sweeps and masking integrity. With only
   life support and sensors powered the Darkstar is indistinguishable
   from a normal asteroid.
   
   The Darkstar is so named because it has the ability to disguise itself
   as a common metallic asteroid and then strike with its massive
   particle accelerator from ambush. The Fellowes of the Royal
   Shipwrights College believe that this ability solves a common problem
   with SDB tactical deployment. Most SDBs are designed to hide in the
   atmospheres of gas giants or in the depths of oceans. While these
   tactics are quite successful in concealing the ship from invaders,
   they also blind the SDBs sensors in equal measure.
   
   To overcome this problem, the Darkstar is designed to hide in plain
   sight. With its drives and weapons powered down, the Darkstar is
   indistinguishable from a normal metallic asteroid. From this position,
   the Darkstar can observe approaching enemies without being detected
   and rally His Majesty\'s space fleet. This remarkable capability is
   made possible by placing the Darkstar inside the shell of an asteroid
   and concealing its thermal emissions with advanced thermal masking
   technology developed by our faculty.
   
   The Darkstar is not merely an early detection platform. It is also
   equipped with the most powerful Particle Accelerator Weapon ever
   constructed for a ship other than a Ship-of-the-Line. This is
   accomplished by another Royal Shipwrights College breakthrough. While
   traditional particle beam weapons are constructed as linear
   accelerators, the Darkstar\'s weapon is a circular accelerator, or
   cyclotron. Cyclotrons can continously accelerate their particle beams
   in a circle and achieve very high particle energies without the need
   for exceedingly long accelerator tunnels. The Darkstar\'s cyclotron can
   vary its rate of fire and release many less energetic shots or a few
   very powerful blasts.
   
   The Darkstar\'s combat capabilities are completed by a pair of laser
   barbettes for point defense and supplementary fire. The Darkstar is
   defended by its outer mettallic asteroid shell as well as an inner
   hull of standard crystaliron armor plate. A brace of sandcaster
   turrets provide another layer of protection.
   
   The Darkstar is made to be able to remain on station in the remotest
   parts of His Majesty\'s Kingdom for extended periods. It carries 3
   months of provisions, a life support system of unlimited endurance,
   electronic and machine shops, as well as a galley and extensive
   exercise facilities to maintain the morale of the crew on long
   deployments. It also is equipped with emergency low berths so that His
   Majesty\'s highly trained naval crewmen can be preserved until they
   reach medical help.
   
   Since the systems of His Majesty\'s kingdom contain numerous planetoid
   belts, gas giant ring systems, and LaGrange point industrial asteroids
   near the mainworlds, the Fellowes believe that the Darkstar will have
   many mundane asteroids amongst which it can hide. The strategic beauty
   of this ship is that once the existence of the Darkstars is known to
   His Majesty\'s enemies, they will never be able to enter one of His
   systems without worrying that any of the countless asteroids in it
   could be a Darkstar quietly stalking them. The effort of making an
   intensive, close-range sensor scan of any asteroid near a gas giant or
   other strategically significant point will provide an enormous
   deterrant against invasion. This deterent will be magnified ad
   infinitum by the suspiscious minds of His Majesty\'s enemies, who will
   see Darkstars everywhere.
   
   The Fellowes of the Royal Shipwrights College are aware that the
   Darkstar is a highly specialized weapon for His Majesty\'s arsenal. For
   this reason, they also offer for consideration a more economical
   version of the Darkstar, known as the Deathstar. The Deathstar is the
   Darkstar shed of its asteroid disguise and advanced thermal masking,
   but retains all of its combat capabilities.
   
   Deathstar Cost: 456.7 MCr Sig: -.5, 0 (-1.5), 0
   
   We believe the combination of the elite Darkstars for early warning
   and the squadrons of Deathstars for open combat will provide precisely
   the defensive strength His Majesty desires.

   The Phoenix Corporation takes great pleasure in unveiling it\'s latest
   design the P-500SD system defence boat.
   
   Cost of 13 examples = MCr 9,573.2
   
   The Phoenix P-500SD is designed as a cost effective patrol and defence
   unit for customers unwilling to utilise current Imperial standard
   equipment. Built around a standard 500dT streamlined slab hull, the
   P-500SD is constucted using only tested componentry which can be
   produced and maintained in a wide variety of frontier locations. The
   modular nature of the P-500SD allows for the replacement of damaged
   component with the minimum of difficulty.
   
   The P-500SD is propelled by 8 standard MCI EF-74 HEPLaR thrusters each
   capable of producing up to 3500 tons of thrust providing up to 4G\'s of
   acceleration. The internal fuel tankage allows for over 10 hours
   operations at full thrust. Power for this and all other onboard
   systems is provided by a single Simmens LT-F12/r 2000Mw fusion
   reactor, fuel for which is drawn from the 207.8 tons of L-Hyd carried
   aboard (the reactors consume 5.35 tons of fuel per 3 months at full
   power, whilst the thrusters consume 20 tons per hour of full thrust).
   The onboard Mitre ADR fuel refinery can process a full load of fuel in
   41.56 hours at a throughput rate of 5 tons per hour. The P-500SD
   utilises a transverse layout allowing the thrusters to operate at 90
   degrees to the decks, neutralising 1G of thrust, greatly improving the
   efficency of it\'s gravitic compensators.
   
   The P-500SD carries a formidable electronics suite. The Matsui CtM-21
   package includes hardened military standard avionics, long range AEMS
   and PEMS sensors, a LADAR range finder/target designator, a 1000AU
   radio, two 1000AU tight beam maser commuinicators and a 1000AU tight
   beam laser communicator. The suite is fully integrated and any
   individual component can be removed and replaced in the event of
   damage. The P-500SD centralises all non-engineering control postions
   on a heavily protected brigde located at the centre of the vessel.
   
   The P-500SD is armed with 3 missile barbettes located amidships, each
   armed with 5 standard ship combat missiles. These missiles are
   controlled by no less than 5 Matsui R7d(c) Master Fire Directors,
   allowing for the P-500SD\'s full missile compliment to be fired and
   controlled at once. Defence is provided by 4 standard PS-C(3)
   sandcaster turrets. It is envisinged that the P-500SD would utilise
   time tested "shoot\'n\'scoot" tactics; emerging from suitably concealed
   locations to fire off a devestating missile volley and then retreating
   to rearm at prepositioned depots hidden throughout the system.
   
   The standard crew roster of the P-500SD is as follows (by department):

Command
   Commander
   First Officer
   Gunnery Officer
   Operations Officer

Manuever
   Pilot
   Astrogator

Gunnery
   5 x missile gunners
   4 x sandcaster gunners

Engineering
   Chief Engineer
   Assistant Engineer

Electronics
   Communictions Officer
   Sensor Officer
   3 x Electronics Technicians

Security
   Master at Arms
   7 x Security personnel

Service
   Medical Officer
   Purser

   The Commander, First Officer and Chief Engineer are all provided with
   large staterooms, all other crew are provided with individual small
   staterooms. The P-500SD additionally has a fully equiped sickbay and
   carries a qualified Medical Officer to handle battle casualties
   without resort to outside facilities.
   
   The streamlined hull of the P-500SD allows for it to lurk at minimal
   power levels in virtually any location within a system, for virtually
   indefinite periods. This makes the P-500SD a potent threat to any
   invading force attempting to gain control of a system. However the
   P-500SD is fully capable of handling the many duties of required of
   such craft in peacetime. It\'s onboard sickbay and excellant sensor
   suite makes it ideal for search and rescue operations and its large
   compliment of security personnel, with it\'s impressive acceleration
   and endurance makes it well suited to routine in system patrol and law
   enforcement. It\'s sophisticated electronics suite also makes it an
   ideal vessel for long range scientific operations and in system survey
   duties.
   
   The P-500SD comes at the modest cost of MCr 736.4 and required 56
   weeks to construct. The Phoenix Corporation encourages licence
   production of the P-500SD utilising local resources; and a technical
   assistance program is available for clients wishing to pursue this
   option.

   To the Council of Nine of the Kaneshi Chartered Guild of Shipwrights,
   
   Please find, enclosed, the official entry of the Goodenuf Construction
   Company for your consideration as an in-system defense craft for the
   Kaneshi Empire. I think you will find this craft uniquely suited to
   your needs and well within the parameters of your Request for
   Proposals.
   
   The Argenaugh System Defense Craft is all about force multipliers. The
   first and most obvious of these is its main armament; a powerful
   Particle Cannon able to "reach out and touch someone" at extreme
   range. This weapon makes the craft capable of affecting invading
   capital ships and allows response to long-range spinal mount fire
   which a craft with lesser weapons would have to endure until it was in
   range with lesser weapons. This also allows the Argenaugh to use \'hit
   and run\' tactics against escorts and pickets which do not have long
   range weapons, striking without allowing the enemy to strike back.
   
   The same philosophy is behind a well stocked missile launcher. With a
   standard load of 40 guided detonation-laser missiles, long patrols or
   extended defensive actions won\'t find the magazine empty. And if
   that\'s not enough, a sizable 25 ton cargo bay is available for
   additional reloads.
   
   And you\'ll find the hefty laser battery for real nose-to-nose combat,
   and point defense lasers and a pair of sandcasters round out the
   active defenses quite nicely.
   
   Multipliers, that\'s what you\'ll find in the best EM Masking package
   available on Kanesh. And the high quality military sensors and
   jammers, which provide the best electronic intelligence possible, and
   allow the ships of the squadron to remain in contact via
   near-impossible-to-intercept laser communicators.
   
   Multipliers are why each Argenaugh SDB to carry additional external
   ordinance in Ten 5-ton external grapples (SSDS Docking Ring). Our
   design team is working on several options for carrying on these racks;
    1. Self-guided "Capital" Missiles : Can you imagine the stopping
       power of a 5 ton detlaser missile? Or perhaps an EMP missile? Or a
       multiple warhead missile; approaching to a certain distance and
       splitting into several missiles?
    2. Mines: which release dozens of more typical homing missiles on
       command or when sensors are triggered. Useful for areas where the
       enemy is guaranteed to visit.
    3. A 10-ton fighter (which would occupy two grapples), which
       otherwise would not be able to travel this far away from its usual
       base.
    4. A set of self contained chemical or HEPlaR rocket boosters for the
       SDB, increasing accelleration to 8G [note; the hull is stressed to
       8G, but the compensators can only handle 6...an uncomfortable
       flight, but not unreasonable]
    5. Remote guided sensor drones with just a passive sensor package,
       M-drive and laser comm, effectively allowing the SDB to be in two
       places at once.
    6. ECM Drones which can mimic the SDB\'s signatures.
    7. Custom packages as specified by the mission and user.
       
   Multipliers...like survivability and toughness. The ship can operate
   with a crew of only 21 [with high automation] but to keep operating
   after being damaged we specify and accomodate a full crew of 31
   [requirement with medium automation]. Armor is another toughness
   factor and we didn\'t skimp there either with a hull armor factor of
   60!. Power is supplied by 7 main power plants and one auxiliary plant,
   and the ship can limp home on just 4 of those-and at 6Gs!
   
   A fuel purification plant, and 6 month fuel supply allow long patrols
   and time on station away from base facilities.
   
   There are those who would tell you to "go cheap" and buy many SDBs.
   Let me tell you that, time and again throughout history, quality has
   ruled over quantity in military engagements. What good is a ship at
   half this price if this vessel can destroy 3 of them without a
   scratch? We offer a full operations and tactics training course for
   your local instructors (for a modest fee) which can aid you in
   bringing your forces up to the highest readiness standard money can
   buy.
   
   Long range weapons, plenty of reloads, mission flexibility, the
   ability to absorb damage, low detectability, and a powerful sensor
   package, these are the force multipliers you are buying when you
   choose the Argenaugh System Defense craft. We at Goodenuf have been
   thinking about system defense for a long time now, and we think this
   combination is what you\'ll need to keep your planets safe.
   
    Designer Notes;
    
   Created using SSDS and the SSDS Design Template spreadsheet by Andrew
   Akins. Since I use the Role-Playing Space Combat system, this design
   is optimized for that relatively simple rules environment.
   
   This craft is a weapons platform, pure and simple. I looked for a
   weapon which does some damage at max range, and built the rest around
   that (the PA). Missiles are an obvious addition. With any luck she can
   "dance" around at max range taking pot shots with missiles and the PA
   and stay out of range of most of her enemy\'s primary armament. In
   action I would fill the cargo bay with missile reloads (reloading
   would have to be done in deep space somewhere probably...there are no
   facilities installed for moving missiles inside the ship from cargo
   bay to missile bay)
   
   Technically, adding anything to the outside of the vessel should
   reduce the accelleration. Practically, since accelleration is based on
   volume rather than mass and the max volume of any external payload is
   (5 tons X 12 docking rings) 60 tons, I would reduce accelleration by
   (60/700=) 8.6% to 5.5Gs. This assumes full loads in all docking rings.
   Note that any layout should take into account that the docking rings
   need to be carefully distributed around the vessel at balanced points
   so that any attached propulsion would work properly.
   
   I used a ring instead of grapples (my intent was grapples) because a
   "Ring" took much less volume and surface area. There was once a
   discussion of what each was, but having neglected to save it I\'m not
   going to dig for it now. It makes no sense to me that a ring is
   smaller than a grapple, so I assume the definitions are not what I
   imagined.
   
   I have yet to design payloads. I think the"sensor drone", "mine" and
   "boosters" are the most practical, since they are generally jettisoned
   before combat. I imagine (although there is plenty of surface area
   left over) that anything attached to the vessel would block some line
   of fire somewhere, which would be a Bad Thing. In play I would make it
   mandatory to jettison any external payload before combat.
   
   The sensor drone deserves a little more attention. They can go active
   and get sensor locks without revealing the location of the main
   vessel. This is a pretty big advantage, and if they worked as I
   describe, then all ships would have these. Since they don\'t, then
   there is probably some basic flaw with the whole concept.
   
   Incidentially, the idea (for externally mounted missiles) came from
   David Weber and Steven White\'s _Insurrection_ Wherein large ships
   would always fire big "capital" missiles from "external ordinance"
   racks just prior to joining combat. The bigger the ship, the bigger
   the missiles it carried.
   
   Crew requirements shown are for Medium automation, but the vessel is
   equipped with high automation. In peacetime much monthly expense can
   be saved by manning this ship with the minimum required crew,
   incidentially making a lot more room aboard. I believe this is similar
   to the manner that some naval vessels today (or perhaps around WWII)
   are manned. Crew are at double occupancy of large staterooms and
   officers at single occupancy of small staterooms when fully manned.
   When short-manned the crew is 19 instead of 31.
   
   I also felt that a steward and medical officer were unnecessary for an
   insystem, military vessel, and omitted them intentionally in the
   interest of space and money.
   
   Notice fuel is for 1/2 a year rather than a year. I though 1 year\'s
   worth of fuel was a bit extreme, but 6 months is not too unreasonable.
   and I could use the space better.

   When the Taneis Covenant was formed, it immediately was swept up into
   the conflict between the K\'Kree and the Community. Recognizing the
   need to protect their new homeworld, the Taneians began two projects.
   The first was a refitting of the Archangel class colony ships into
   large planetoid monitors. The second was the creation of a large fleet
   of small yet powerful defence craft.
   
   The Taneis Covenant was still essentially at tech level 9, and
   designing a craft to meet the performance requirements proved to be
   impossible. Thus, a crash technology improvement program was begun,
   with the intention of reaching tech level 12 to match the Krahz/Chk.
   With the assistance of the Krahz/Chk, the technology uplift was
   started. However, going from tech level 9 to tech level 12 cannot
   happen overnight, even with help. Thus, it was determined that a
   interim system defence boat would be built. With assistance from the
   Bugs (Krahz/Chk), the Wraith class SDB was designed.
   
   In many ways, the Wraith resembles an old SSBN submarine from Terra\'s
   history (indeed, many of the Taneian\'s on the design team used SSBNs
   as a conceptual model). The key aspects of the design are stealth, and
   the reliance on missile weaponry.
   
   Since the limitations of HEPlAR prevented a high speed craft (fuel
   consumption being the greatest problem), the Wraith relies on armor
   and stealth for survivability. Since it\'s primary weapon is capable of
   operating in a independant, stand-off mode, the Wraith spends most of
   its time hiding. The ship can loiter in a Gas Giant or planetoid belt,
   lurking and waiting for a target. The ship is highly armored and
   structurally reinforced (the hull can withstand 30Gs without
   compensation, nearly 32Gs with), not only to absorb battle damage, but
   to allow the ship to descend deep into a Gas Giant and wait. An
   advanced EMM radiation system allows the ship to be invisible while
   lurking. One of the problems with stealth is sensor use - any use of
   active sensors effectively invalidates the stealth. To deal with this
   problem, the Wraith carries 2 10ton Oracle class sensor drones. These
   advanced vehicles are little more than drives, sensors, and tight-beam
   communicators. The Oracles become the eyes and ears of the mothership
   - leaving the gas giant and seeking out targets. The Oracles can also
   act as communications repeaters - stretching the control range of the
   Wraith\'s missiles (with appropriate communication delays). In dire
   circumstances, the Oracles can be used as weapons, as each carries a
   single high power detonation laser. This use is frowned up, as it
   destroys the drone (and they are quite expensive ).
   
   The primary weapon load of the Wraith are 60 ADL-67 guided missiles.
   These compact, powerful weapons provide superior standoff attack
   performance, and are more than capable of delivering a terminal attack
   against capital class ships. The Wraith can launch 8 missiles at a
   time, and can normally control 8 missiles in flight (in two groups of
   4). However, if a larger salvo is required, the Oracle controllers can
   place their sensor drones into loiter mode ( a semi-independent mode
   freeing up the control channels ) and each Oracle station can control
   4 missiles - thus allowing for 16 missiles in flight ( in four groups
   of 4 ). Note that even if the Oracle controllers switch to ordnance
   control mode, only 8 missiles can be launched at one time. The normal
   mode of operation would be as follows:
    1. Eight missiles are launched, and control is "handed-off" to the
       Oracle operators.
    2. The launchers are reloaded.
    3. Eight more missiles are launched, with control being handled by
       the ordnance gunners. There are now 16 weapons in use.
       
   For close-in and anti-missile action, a single laser emitter is
   mounted amidships. The laser is useful also to "clean-up" a weakened
   ship.
   
   The Wraith is a comfortable design - each crewmember has his own
   stateroom the (Captain and Executive Officer have large rooms). To
   facilitate long missions, sixteen low berths are provided. The ships
   computer is capable of operating the ship in "prowling" mode, while
   the crew hibernates. When a threat is detected, the ship auto-wakes
   the medic, who then monitors the waking of the rest of the crew. Each
   crew member is provided a G-Tank to provide a bit more compensation
   against high-gravity maneuvers and environments.
   
   Critics of the Wraith tend to attack three aspects: low speed, fuel
   endurance, and lack of long range beam weaponry.
   
   With its reliance on HEPlAR technology, it was difficult to provide
   maneuver performance. The decision was made to rely on stealth rather
   than speed for defensive actions.
   
   Since the Wraith is designed to loiter in a gas giant, the 15 G-hour
   endurance was deemed acceptable. The designers also provided
   "immediate refueling" capability - the ship can refine fuel as it
   scoops.
   
   The limited usefulness of small beam weapons at tech level 10 prompted
   the decision for missile weaponry. The Wraith carries a large magazine
   of weapons (enough for 15 salvos), it is considered unlikely that any
   conflict would last that long.
   
   For transport to other systems, the Wraith can be mated to a Brute
   class tender.

   The Balboa class SDB is intended to provide a long term threat to any
   invading force. The system\'s main selling point is its long term
   endurance and incredible toughness.
   
   The Balboa is not intended to stand alone. It requires support in the
   form of missile reloads and fueling stations, and is limited to vacuum
   operations.
   
   The Balboa is a small, unstreamlined sphere. First thing a viewer
   notes is the large fusion rocket assembly. This was chosen
   deliberately for both economic reasons, and for the nuisance value the
   hazardous blackblast plays with any attempt at pursuit. The three
   missile barbettes are spacing around the ships waist, and draw from a
   300 missile magazine at the center of the ship.
   
   Inside, the Balboa is surprisingly luxurious, with all crew members
   receiving a private room. Since the Balboa is intended to operate for
   months at a time in the deepest reaches of the systems hinterlands,
   this level of privacy and comfort was deemed a very necessary design
   feature.
   
   The Balboa has huge fuel tanks, enough to provide maneuver
   capabilities for many weeks at combat tempo. In addition, the McGee
   Power 291Mw Fission plant has sufficient fuel for several years of
   operation at modest loads. Sensor operations are provided by a modest
   suite of military sensors, the thought being that an invader will be
   making enough noise to be found with relative ease.
   
   It is the design bureau\'s vision that Balboas would operate in groups
   of three, trading sensor information and fire solutions. A tender is
   in the planning stages, as one is clearly needed to support extended
   combat ops. It is humbly suggested that the Defense Board consider
   pre-placing fuel and missile cache at strategic points throughout our
   system.

   The Type 88621-A is a lower-tech version of the popular Type 88621-C
   SDB in Imperial service. Designed around proven Sylean Industry Norm
   (SIN) modular components, this vessal can be built rapidly in any
   commercial or military shipyard. The resulting cost savings are
   considerable, allowing a capable ship to be built at a low price.
   Since it is built to SIN Tech-A standards, it can be serviced and
   repaired by clients without advanced dockyard facilities outside the
   Imperium.
   
   The design philosphy of the Type 88621-A places highest priority on
   operational flexibility. In practical terms, this means a high-quality
   sensor system to search out the enemy, an airframe hull that allows
   operations in all environments (including gas giant atmospheres), high
   acceleration to avoid superior forces, and a mix of missile and gun
   armament to suit a variety of targets. What this ship cannot destroy,
   it can run away from, aided by the large array of sandcasters to
   protect from enemy fire.
   
   The Type 88621-A is also designed to operate for prolonged periods
   with little outside support. The large 71 ton cargo bay is designed
   for missile storage to reload firing tubes, allowing multiple volleys.
   A large MFD array allows the crew to control and target a mass launch
   of all 15 missiles at once. For smaller, weaker targets (and for
   finishing off larger ones), the PA gun allows economical fire that
   does not expend expensive missiles, allowing for longer time between
   resupply. Finally, the onboard mechanical shop and fuel refining
   system mean that the Type 88621-A is independant of base support.
   
   Crew accomadations are standard, with a large stateroom for the
   Captain, small staterooms for the other command crew and the pilot,
   and bunks for the other crew members.
   
   Please contact your nearest Generica sales office for more information
   about the Type 88621-A and other fine Generica ships.

   Another product of the New Victoria Naval Architects design bureau,
   the "Unicorn"-class SDB is purpose-built for the export market.
   Targetted at Imperial client-states and low-tech NonImperial worlds,
   the Unicorn is capable of performing patrol, customs,
   piracy-supression and light system-defence duties.
   
   Like NVNA\'s other commercial designs, the Unicorn is constructed
   entirely from ISDP components. Not only does this reduce costs, it is
   also hoped that the demand for spares will help bring outside worlds
   closer to the Imperium. [Note to PR Rep: Leave this bit out of the
   export-market advertising, OK?]
   
   The Unicorn is based around a 500 DspT streamlined slab hullform and
   the smallest possible TL-10 ISDP fusion power-plant - which still
   produces a healthy surplus of 40 Mw. Acceleration of two standard
   gravities is provided by a 560 Mw HEPLaR drive system. While this
   acceleration may seem low, the limited G-compensation technology
   available at this tech level make it the best that can be done without
   adversely affecting crew performance. The fuel tanks hold fifty
   G-hours worth of reaction mass, and the ship is fitted with fuel
   scoops and a small purification plant to allow wilderness refuelling
   and prolonged operations.
   
   Like most other SDBs, the Unicorn relies on missiles for its primary
   armament; however, it mounts a single forward-mounted laser as a
   backup and for those occasions where the deadly force of a missile is
   unnecessary or not deemed cost-effective. Fire-control is provided by
   two MFDs, each of which is capable of controlling three missiles, as
   well as a dedicated MFD on the laser. The hull is lightly armoured,
   but is backed by twin sandcaster turrets. Controls, communications and
   sensor arrays are all military grade; however, because of the sensor\'s
   limited range we recommend that the Unicorn be deployed in groups or
   be equipped with sensor drones.
   
   Crew accomodations follow the standard Imperial pattern; the Captain
   and other officers each have individual staterooms (the Captain\'s
   being larger, of course), while the crew share small staterooms.
   Finally, 8 tons of cargo space is provided, which can be used to carry
   extra stores for long-duration missions or as an extra missile
   magazine (16 rounds capacity).

   Option:Bruce Alan Macintosh posted his list of QSDS sensors design
   with FF&S2. If those sensors are used in place of the current QSDS
   sensor the Kukri\'s sensors would be: Small Mil: Power 7.0MW, Cost
   135.0MCr, Area 26.5m2, Vol 5.1dton, Minimum Hull size 40dton, Rating
   A11.5 P13.5 L14.5 JA11 JP0, Crew 2.0. With these sensors the Kukri
   cargo would be reduced to 15.3dton.
   
   The ship\'s cost would be increased to 1000.4MCr and the discounted
   cost would be 750.3MCr if the sensors are considered standard QSDS
   components or 784.8MCr if not.

   Star Command PublicInfoFeed: The Ashkha Star Command is proud to
   announce the latest addition to the fleet, the Kukri class System
   Defense Boat. The Kukri be the largest and most advanced craft in the
   Home Defense Division and will the first craft in the fleet to use
   laser weapons. Finally lasers have been developed to the point where
   they are powerful enough and have a sufficient range to be used in
   space combat. The Kukri\'s four 400 Megajoule lasers can fire on
   targets as far a 300,000km away. However, as fearsome as the Kukri\'s
   lasers are, she is also armed with 40 missiles and is capable of
   engaging 14 targets simultaneously with the use of 2 master fire
   directors and 8 security troopers in the barbetts. At the heart of the
   boat are two 1,500MW Power Plants which can fully power all system at
   the same time. All of this is encase in a 10cm Crystaliron hull and is
   propelled by an array of 16 Yakdyne engines giving the Kukri a maximum
   acceleration of 20ms2. While the boat can accommodate 40 individuals
   with 32 bunks and 8 stateroomes, the normal operating crew is 33
   including a 14 member security contingent. This security contingent
   allows the Kukri to perform customs and rescue duties in addition to
   its system defense role. Overall the Ashkha Star Command is quit
   confident that that Kukri will help ensure the security and safety of
   Ashkha for many decades to come.
   
   [Less than two years later only two Kukri class System Defense Boats
   would survive the Invasion of Ashkha by the People\'s Assembly of
   Luurin Uugluu.] 
   
    Design Notes:
    
   The design was done with the assistance of Craig Barry\'s QSDS
   spreadsheet. Basically this boat is designed to show what a TL-10
   craft using lasers would be like. The 32 bunks mentioned above were
   built as small staterooms, to allow for the extra space needed to
   properly represent the bunks and the various crew common areas on the
   deckplans. Missile barbetts in QSDS and heavy missile turrets in SSDS
   are inconsistent.
   
   While for the most part they seem the same the turrets in SSDS include
   workstations for gunners, while QSDS makes no mention of this. Also
   QSDS requires bridge workstations for all gunners, while SSDS requires
   bridge workstations only for MFD operators. In these cases I chose go
   use the SSDS rulings over the QSDS ones.

   Kor-El is X-TEK\'s Low Tech Shipyard Branch, just recently made a
   partner in the corporation. The KE-SD/10a "Predator" is Kor-El\'s First
   Attempt at a purely military craft, using available TL-10 technology
   and X-TEK military strategy. The \'target saturation\' tactic (common in
   low tech navies) was incorporated into the Predator by the use of a
   100ton missile bay. With thise bay the Predator can launch up to 8
   missiles in the space around it per combat round, therefore confusing
   the enemy with multiple inbounds. The bay comes equiped with an MFD
   control systems, but 2 more Missile MFD\'s were installed so a full
   spread be guided to the target with pinpoint accuracy. Although
   origonaly designed with the Standard TL-10 HE Missile in mind (about
   0.1Mcr each) X-Ray Nuke Pulsed Warhead missiles could be installed in
   the bay as well, but the cost of such missiles is significantly
   higher. (about 0.9Mcr each). Defence was addressed by giving the
   Predator 4 Sandcasters for beam deflection, and 4 Point Defence Lasers
   to deal with possible inbound missiles. Also so that it may hide in
   it\'s \'lair\' and strike without warning, the Preditor is equiped with
   EM Masking. The Predator having no J drive is a strictly systembound
   craft, with the added room, more fuel has been added for the HePLaR
   Engines, up to 12 hours duration at a constant 2g velocity, this does
   not limit the craft however as it is also capable of gas giant
   refueling. The fuel processor insures that only clean H2 gets pumped
   into the HePlaR, maximizing effecency and reducing wear on the HePlaR.
   The Predator was designed for long duration patrols in mind and
   therefore the crew was given attention with 6 Large Staterooms for the
   Senior Officers(Captain, 1st officer, Electronics Chief, Chief
   Engineer, Chief Pilot, and Gunnery Sergeant) and 12 Smaller staterooms
   for the remaining crew.
   
   Another variant in the works is the KE-SD/10a. This variant forgoes
   the Missile bay by replacing it with a TL-10 100ton bay laser.
   Although a bay sized laser is the most efective laser weapon at this
   tech level, it does tend to be very expensive and consumes enormous
   amounts of power. This was X-TEK/Kor-El\'s first concept, but price
   concerns cancelled that project at the last minuite. The missile
   configuration above being prefered for the mission specs of the PE
   issuing the order.

                              Dear Lord Byron,
                                      
    Vulkan Werft is most interested to hear that Autarch Zomaiir III is
    planning to invest in System Defense Boats. Security of our glorious
      Kaneshi Empire is paramount. We laud the plans to use local ship
   builders which will strengthen the Empire\'s industry and development.
                                      
   As you know, Vulkan Werft has had a long history in building civilian
   ships such as small armed freighters (the so-called \'Rock\'n\'Rollers\').
       Less well known is the fact that our sister company, Luerssen
   (manufacturers of the Luerssen class Fleet Escort), have had a design
     for an SDB on the board for several years. This design is based on
     their well known Fleet Escort which is widely feared by Vargrs and
      pirates alike as it capitalizes on the best of recorded Solomani
                               technologies.
                                      
   Your suggested purchase order of 10,000 MCr would allow us to produce
   twelve 300 dt Eman SDBs and 2 Maechti 900 dt Battle Tenders capable of
   transferring three Emans two parsecs. The budget would also cover two
                 additional 600 dt Luerssen Fleet Escorts.
                                      
   All the craft are streamlined wedges with an armor factor of 80, fuel
     scoops and purification plants capable of cracking their hydrogen
    requirements in three hours. This makes it possible to run a secure
              frontier refueling operation in some 6-9 hours.
                                      
    Our well known 250 MW ultra heavy Luerssen laser (3-3-2-0) provides
    fire power in long range fights. Two missile auto launchers are able
     to fire six missiles per round, an impact even larger ships should
    fear. Two sandcasters and three 65 Mj point defense lasers (2:1/6-20
     rof 200) serve as active defense. EMM masking, AEMS-5 jamming and
     decoy dispensers ensure that a typical corsair will not even get a
    fire control lock. Combat history shows that quality of sensors and
    the number of fire controls make the difference between victory and
    defeat. Thus, the Eman SDB is equipped with an A0-P5-J5 suite and 3
                       fire controls of that calibre.
                                      
      A dedicated 4th point defense fire control is able to shoot six
    missiles point blank per round, but is also able to combine two 65Mj
                 lasers as a 4-0-0-0 battery in dog fights.
                                      
    A crew of 14 is recommended for battle stations and, of course, the
   damage control team has own contra-grav beds as the Eman is capable of
   4G evasion. A second A0-P4-J0 sensor suite and avionics package at the
   chief\'s control desk serve as a backup. So it always possible to bring
   the Eman home as long as the power plant is running. The Plant is our
       well known 1000MW Wendelstein C-N-O Fusion. Eman\'s HEPlaR and
   jumpdrive for the Maechti Tender are also compatible with our civilian
   products. Thus maintainance should not be a problem at any reasonably
                             equipped starport.
                                      
          The Maechti Battle Tender is a warship in its own right.
                                      
    Three Luerssen lasers, two fast missile launchers, four sandcasters
     and six point defense lasers (with 6+2 fire controls) bolster the
   Emans\' weapons whilst still leaving accomodation room. For the sensor
   suite, an A10-P5-J5 has been chosen for high performance and to drive
   opponents between the silently lurking Emans. The 1750 MW Wendelstein
       power plant (from our well known 2999er bulk carrier) and the
    Niehlsboah jump drive (from our 1799er wilds Rock\'n\'Roller) form the
   backbone of the ship\'s manoevrability. Both are reliable and have been
    fully tested in civilian roles. The Maechti also provides repair and
    recreation facilities for the Emans and their crews in longer fleet
    operations. A large repair shop, two fabrication facilities, as well
               as a sickbay with 12 low berths are included.
                                      
      The Maechti has a crew of 50 including five officers. Full scale
    operations can include up to 92 warriors, 14 of them noble officers.
    The officer\'s wardroom is naturally kept separate from the enlisted
                              crew\'s messdeck.
                                      
   Vulkan Werft understand that our beloved Autarch Zomaiir III specified
   cheap missile bulk carriers when requesting an SDB proposal. However,
     in our most humble opinion, an SDB/Tender/Escort combination will
     cover many more areas of operation and be far more versatile than
                             twenty SDBs alone.
                                      
    Your dear son, Sir van Werschenrege, understood to be the next fleet
   commander, would have a strong fleet with the Maechtis, capable of not
       only defending our borders but able to counterstrike at will.
                                      
                            With Kindly Regards,

     Timothy.Collinson@solent.ac.uk ( vilani lector ;-)
     
                                 Addendum:
                                      
        For a first review we include T4 classification for further
                            information refer to
                                      
     http://www.is-bremen.de/~kraehe/traveller/shipyard/kaneshi
     
                containing deckplan and FFS classifications.
                                      
   The Eman SDB and Maechti Battle Tender from Vulkan Werft are state of
   the art TL10 warships. The Maechti is capable of carrying three Eman
   SDBs. It provides repair facilties for the three craft and recreation
   areas for their crews.
   
   As the Emans carry fuel it is possible for the Battle Tender to make a
   two parsec jump by deep space refuelling. A frontier refuelling takes
   three hours per ship. Jump preparation is 30 minutes with Emans
   attached or 15 without.
   
   Unlike backwater shipyards common elsewere in the wilds, Vulkan Werft
   use sophisticated sensors and fire controls in conjunction with
   specially designed weapons.
   
   The most noticeable features of both the SDB and it\'s tender are the
   huge 250 Mj Luerssen lasers with a diameter of 11.6 metres and the 40
   meter passive EMS sensor array.
   
   Visitors to Emans often wonder why there are bunks filling almost all
   available free bulkheads. They\'re soon told that these are contra-grav
   beds for the damage control teams so they can avoid the enormous
   acceleration the Eman is capable of.
   
   On the bridge, a modern dynamically linked installation can be seen,
   surrounded by 19" racks for fire controls and computers. Warriors who
   have served on an Eman say that it\'s a nice enough ship as long as
   it\'s only used for short term operations (with 14 people in single
   occupation) or attached to a Maechti. However, it is really cramped
   with double occupancy. Some mention that even with the contra-grav
   beds at crew stations, 4G is not acceptable for more than half an hour
   or so. A typical officer will respond: "this is a warship, not a
   yacht. You\'re a soldier not here on holiday - if 4G evasion\'ll keep us
   alive - we\'ll take it and like it." The main problem with Emans is
   that first line crews prefer the jump capable Maechti or Luerssen and
   often officers feel degraded when they get a commission to serve on an
   Eman. The Kaneshi Empire is working to ameliorate this by offering
   landgrants to nobles who serve on Emans and faster promotions for
   enlisted warriors.

   It is with proud hearts and eager orderbooks that RGNA unveils the
   newest revolution in system-wide Close Defense Vessels, the Scenic
   View class CDV.
   
   Conforming in its entirety to the specifications laid down by the
   great Autarch Zomaiir III on Makan IV:33 Upper, the Scenic View class
   redefines the capabilities of system defense vessels, and pushes the
   price:performance ratio to an all-new high. Coming equipped with
   weaponry to give even the most expansionist enemy pause for thought,
   the Scenic View makes no comprises when the defense of the realm is at
   stake - and neither should you!
   
   Due to an almost unbelievable program of cost-cutting and
   fat-trimming, RGNA can now offer the Scenic View to interested
   governments and other RGNA-approved purchasers at the amazing price of
   1,520 MCr each, enabling a run of 6 vessels for a mere 9,122.16 MCr
   (6.58 vessels per 10 GCr).
   
   Remember - when there is something rotten in your neighbourhood, don\'t
   worry about \'alas\' - just call on Rosencrantz & Guildenstern NA, Inc.,
   and all your problems will sail away.
   
   The Scenic View class provides for all your planetary defense needs:
     * The top of the range \'NightLight\' sensor suite is especially
       designed for early detection of hostiles, with redundant backup
       systems to enable full sensor capability even after sustaining
       significant battle damage
     * The state of the art \'MaxPak3\' HEPlaR thruster system has been
       built in for those rapid interceptions - make sure the crew are
       strapped into their workstations before starting the burn!
     * The awesome \'HullBusterLight\' spinal particle cannon is weight for
       weight the most powerful weapon ever mounted on this type of
       vessel. With long-range accuracy and close-up penetration at only
       a moderate power consumption, this is the heart of the Scenic
       View.
     * The \'LongArcher\' high-endurance bay missile system is the perfect
       complement to the custom mixture of \'Hedgehog\' rapid deployment
       launchers - in total the system is capable of fielding 24 DetLaser
       missiles in the first moments of any engagement, and can maintain
       continuous deployment for a total of 390 minutes (6.5 standard
       hours!)
     * In defense, the tried and true \'BallastMan\' sandcaster system is
       fitted to help avoid scratching the paintwork on the heavily
       armoured hull, aided by the \'SilentNight4\' EMM system designed
       expressly for the Scenic View (also available as an option on
       other ships in this range - see brochure for details).
     * The mission endurance of the Scenic View is enhanced by the
       incorporation of maximum flow-rate fuel scoops and purifiers,
       giving complete refuelling in little over 5 standard hours.
     * To increase crew comfort, a 56 m^3 recreation area has been added
       to the military standard bunks provided for the enlisted
       personnel, while officers are quartered in luxurious 28 m^3
       individual staterooms.

I\'m not the \'inventor\' of THUDDD -- think that was Wildstar -- but I am
the current operator.  As the approximately 3.7 gigs of THUDDD 6 data
which I just sent to TML/ISBA may indicate, reports of THUDDD\'s demise
have been greatly exaggerated...it was more like a month-long coma. :)

I *have* decided to make the THUDDD bimonthly rather than monthly, as this
has been happening despite my plans otherwise since May, and I\'m not one
to argue with the Powers of Fate.  So, THUDDD 6 is being called the
"September 1997" contest, and the next one, THUDDD 7, will be the
"November 1997" contest.  The vessel for TH7 will be a heavy fighter, most
likely 20-50 tons. 

By the way, all THUDDD data can be found at the THUDDD website:

  http://www.cinenet.net/users/cberry/thuddd.html

Once again, apologies to all on my prolonged inability to move THUDDD
forward.  I hope we can now make up for lost time!

Just for the record.  I wouldn\'t call myself a very religious man, but I
am deeply spiritual.

I don\'t go to a church, but I am a firm believer in the Allmighty.  

As a matter of fact, I\'m reading the Bible (New King James version)
straight through as we speak.  I\'m about to finish the first book of
Samuel.

You may think I took the Lord\'s name in vain, but I don\'t look at it
like that.  Saying Jesus Christ as an expletive is not taking the Lord\'s
name in vain.  I can think of some words that do qualify, but I don\'t
use them.

  Silly sentient,  borders are marked in space the
same way they are marked on a map,  with ink. (OK,
sometimes blood.)    You jump a ship out to the 
border site,  spray color pigments of your choice
about into space,  and jump back to base.  You have
just \'marked\' one pixel in your border design.
   Repeat as required by design detail,  and budget
constraints permiting.

*This is the FF&S2 rating.  Sensors are listed by sensitivity and 
Signature is listed Sig: Visible, IR(powered down), Active

Notes:  The Darkstar is equipped with extended life support capable of 
maintaining atmosphere and water indefinitely.  It carries 3 months of 
normal rations and 2 weeks emergency rations.  It is equipped with a 
galley, two gyms, and both machine and electronic shops.  The low berths 
are emergency berths for casualties.  The Fuel Shuttle can completely 
refuel the Darkstar in 11 hours.  Additional crew is carried so that 
sensor and engineering stations can stay at Alert status at all times.  
With only life support and sensors powered the Darkstar is 
indistinguishable from a normal asteroid.

	The Darkstar is so named because it has the ability to disguise 
itself as a common metallic asteroid and then strike with its massive 
particle accelerator from ambush.  The Fellowes of the Royal Shipwrights 
College believe that this ability solves a common problem with SDB 
tactical deployment.  Most SDBs are designed to hide in the atmospheres 
of gas giants or in the depths of oceans.  While these tactics are quite 
successful in concealing the ship from invaders, they also blind the SDBs 
sensors in equal measure.  
	To overcome this problem, the Darkstar is designed to hide in 
plain sight.  With its drives and weapons powered down, the Darkstar is 
indistinguishable from a normal metallic asteroid.  From this position, 
the Darkstar can observe approaching enemies without being detected and 
rally His Majestys space fleet.  This remarkable capability is made 
possible by placing the Darkstar inside the shell of an asteroid and 
concealing its thermal emissions with advanced thermal masking technology 
developed by our faculty.  
	The Darkstar is not merely an early detection platform.  It is 
also equipped with the most powerful Particle Accelerator Weapon ever 
constructed for a ship other than a Ship-of-the-Line.  This is 
accomplished by another Royal Shipwrights College breakthrough.  While 
traditional particle beam weapons are constructed as linear accelerators, 
the Darkstars weapon is a circular accelerator, or cyclotron.  Cyclotrons 
can continously accelerate their particle beams in a circle and achieve 
very high particle energies without the need for exceedingly long 
accelerator tunnels.  The Darkstars cyclotron can vary its rate of fire 
and release many less energetic shots or a few very powerful blasts.
	The Darkstars combat capabilities are completed by a pair of 
laser barbettes for point defense and supplementary fire.  The Darkstar 
is defended by its outer mettallic asteroid shell as well as an inner 
hull of standard crystaliron armor plate.  A brace of sandcaster turrets 
provide another layer of protection.
	The Darkstar is made to be able to remain on station in the 
remotest parts of his Kingdom for extended periods.  It carries 3 months 
of provisions, a life support system of unlimited endurance, and a galley 
and extensive exercise facilities to maintain the morale of the crew on 
long deployments.  It also is equipped with emergency low berths so that 
His Majestys highly trained naval crewmen can be preserved until they 
reach medical help.
	Since the systems of His Majestys kingdom contain numerous 
planetoid belts, gas giant ring systems, and LaGrange point industrial 
asteroids near the mainworlds, the Fellowes believe that the Darkstar 
will have many mundane asteroids amongst which it can hide.  The 
strategic beauty of this ship is that once the existence of the Darkstars 
are known to His Majestys enemies, they will never be able to enter one 
of His systems without worrying that any of the countless asteroids in it 
could be a Darkstar quietly stalking him.  The effort of making an 
intensive, close-range sensor scan of any asteroid near a gas giant or 
other strategically significant point will provide an enormous deterrant 
against invasion.  This deterent will be  magnified ad infinitum by the 
suspiscious minds of His Majestys enemies, who will see Darkstars 
everywhere.  This effect can be increased by placing asteroids of the 
approximate displacement of the Darkstar in various locations as scarecrows.

I had been thinking about *exactly* this very issue recently.  I came up with 
all sorts of pros and cons, sometimes an issue was both a pro and a con!

Staterooms - as these are about the size of a cabin on an overnight ferry, it 
seems reasonable to treat them like this in Traveller.  Time on-board is to 
linked to time to reach the jump point, giving M-6 ships a reason to exist for 
resons other than combat.

Low berth - everyone woyld need to keep count of "jump week" in the same way 
that low berthers do now.  Low berth would not be cold sleep, but represent 
people travelling without the benefits of a stateroom - hey just mill around in 
the common areas.

Frozen watch - still used for those long patrols.

Distance learning - no more excuses for PC to "learn" Electronics-4 with all the 
spare time in jump space.

Cost of travel - with travel times reduced to less than 24 hours (subjective 
time) it is reasonable to compare jump travel to modern jet aircraft travel ... 
you can cram a lot of people in and reduce the cost of passage to (say) Cr2000 
per parsec.  Just imagine a jump "cruise", you spend a day travelling to the 
next port of call, where you get to visit the local area before your liner jumps 
to the next exciting port of call.  Some places are not very exciting, and you 
stop only to refuel and bring aboard fres fruit (or whatever).

Minimal change to Traveller background - information still travels slowly, but 
we can finally explain those laow freight charges that bug so many people!  I 
like the idea of Free traders being like small cargo ships of fifty years ago 
where carrying a passenger or two to supplement the freight income was 
relatively common.  In the traveller universe, using Free Traders as a "pot 
luck" transport system for rich (by TL 8 standards) backpackers stikes a chord 
with me.

Too much change to the Traveller background - the "feel" of the whole jump & 
trade system will change in a way that many will find uncomfortable.  Newbies 
will never know the difference, so it will not matter to them.

The Long Patrol - Imperial Fleets run a multiple-jump patrol pattern to fly the 
flag in many systems before returning to their "home" port.  Gas gaint 
refuelling and imediate jump to the next system will mean that Navy ships have 
staerooms and life support costs identical to current design systems.

New opportunities to handwave - jump drives now use hydrogen to open up a 
"corridor" between the departure point and the arrival point.  The dimensions of 
this corridor (L, W, H) correspond to the equivalent dimensions of the ship as 
well as distance jumped - which neatly explains why jump "fuel" is proportional 
to volume x Jn.  You cannot "see through" the window to check out your 
destination.  Ships are generally in the corridor for a few seconds (percieved) 
time, and anything that is thrown out of the airlock (or otherwise ejected) will 
usually remain in the tunnel and emerge into normal space with the ship.  
Bullet, lasers, pogo-stick-powered-EVAs and similar "rapid" departure from the 
ship will invariably penetrate the outer limit of the corridor and be lost.  No 
public records exist of people or items surviving rapid departure.  There are a 
few religious groups who claim that seeing the tunnel with their own eyes (from 
an open airlock door) is the ultimate mystical experience.  There are other who 
claim that repeated exposure will make you mad. Scientists have been interested 
by the readings obtained from sensor packages pushed out of the air lock (with 
control wires trailing back into the ship).  Identical sensor packages using 
different EM communication methods (laser, radio) return different readings 
depending on the EM band being used... blah, blah, blah.


Overall, I can\'t decide if I like this departure from the Traveller background 
... but I\'m sure the following debate on the TML will be interesting!

You are reading it correctly.  It was a mistake in both editions.

Well, Marc did say that FF&S2 wouldn\'t be *completely* invalidated.  
I did notice that the proportions he gave for the wedge hull were 1:1 
height:width, whereas the FF&S2 one is 1:2.4:3.5 height:width:length...

This might be a good time to mention that I\'m working on a ship 
design process based exclusively on FF&S2 and some extra physics.  
(Not working very hard, I admit.)  The end product ought to be of 
about the same complexity as SSDS on average, with some cute extra 
features.

How about looking at the situation an alternative way (i.e. from the
viewpoint of the merchant rather than the pirate):

1. Merchant ships are so expensive that if someone comes along who wants a
fight, it\'s cheaper for the merchant crew to lose their cargo than to have
their ship damaged? This is presuming that the ship has anti-hijack systems
(to prevent all the drives, etc. working) which make stealing the ship
itself pretty much impossible.

2. Merchant ships can\'t afford to have any civilian casualties, so as per 1,
it\'s cheaper for them to hove to.

3. A lot of pirates use 1 & 2 and rather than actually bothering many ships,
live off the protection racket, which is probably cheaper to the merchants
than insuring their ships against the pirates?

It might sound a bit silly at first, but if you look at the real world,
things like (3) above tend to happen quite a bit...

That would depend on just what version of the jump rules you use. Some of
them has jump arrivals accurate to (IIRC) 30,000 km.

You\'re forgetting the most crucial difference between a navy ship and a
pirate/corsair: The navy is paid to fight, the pirate only fights to get
paid. In other words, pirates don\'t like fair fights... or any fight that
may impose repair bills greater than the potential gain.

>(which is why you need to have multiple ships of decent size).  

Which is what you would have. You appear to have completely ignored my
financial arguments, ie. how many assets a world pays for _anyway_. I\'m
not talking about ships employed by a merchant who can\'t use more to
defend with than he gains by defending it. I\'m talking about government 
who has the ships in the first place and may as well get some use out of
them.

Right, and I suppose no merchant would ever bother with insurance, because
statistically insurance is always more expensive than the event it insures
against. Losing a few credits worth of fuel is peanuts to the potential
losses. The time lost is a lot more expensive and even that is not very
much compared to the potential loss. Plus, it\'s not like the merchants
would have any choice if the government demanded it.

It is the exact same problem as insurance. If only one house in 10,000
ever burns down, why bother with fire insurance? The answer is that it
is really ruins your life if you happen to be no. 10,000. Losing a few
credits to safety precautions won\'t break a company  --  they just pass
along the expense to their customers  --  but losing a cargo or a ship
really will (So the will have piracy insurance; one way or another the
customers get to pay anyway; it makes sense to go with the solution that
makes plunder and mayhem an unviable option).

It would be another story if you had to detatch, say, 10% of your planetary
defenses to do this on other worlds. But you don\'t. We\'re talking about a
fraction of 1/1000th of you planetary defense. Makes a difference, don\'t 
you think?

No, not really. Most Gas Giants won\'t be used for refuelling anyway. Those
that are will have an area patrolled by a few patrol ships (those that don\'t
have a refuelling station selling refined fuel orbiting the Gas Giant; it
won\'t take much regular traffice before such a station is economically
viable). And Gas Giants are so big that even for completely unguarded Gas
Giants the chance of a pirate lurking just where you decide to skim is
quite remote.

Not even a fraction of 1/1000th of their forces? If nothing else, piracy
is bad publicity; a succesful piracy would reflect badly on the Imperium
and on the Imperial Navy.

It\'s a question of degree. Customs officials don\'t get all that upset about
the odd smuggled bottle, so they only spot-check for smugglers. Air-port
security really detest hijackings, so they closely scrutinize every single
passenger. The kind of dislike a government has for pirates are of the
second kind. They will do it if 1) they can afford it (and they can) and
2) it is necessary (and it won\'t be necessary for all ships, only those
they don\'t know well).

If you reply, please do address the question of how many assets would be
needed to curb piracy and how many assets are available.

place of many dimensions.
The one week (+/-) travel time is just a vagary of the wierd rules that
operate there.

We\'ve never had a \'canon\' explanation of exactly what goes on in Jspace, and I\'m glad.
Because it means we can play with the concept and do what we like. I\'ve
always assumed a connection with psionics and Jspace, and also that there
are \'things\' in there.

Let me tell you a story:

Venturer and Footloose are travelling to Darvli Ga to begin the SDC uplift
operation. Footloose is a far trader full of NPCs and important mission
supplies. Venturer is the players\' ship. A couple of systems ago they
encountered the Jump Institute, a collection of labships and Navy escorts
which conducts Jump-related field experiments. Some of them are rather
dangerous.

Larsen, second engineer of the Footloose, was bribed to make an
experimental modification to the Jump Governor. The Institute is a couple
of systems away by now and not immediately brought to mind when the Jfield
begins to distort. Both ships Jump  together by computer link, to they\'ll
come out together.

Which means they\'ll both misjump!

Actually the characters\' ship entered Jspace rather badly, but made it
after a high-pressure \'damage control\' scene. Larsen saw what was happening
to her ship and jumped into the ship\'s boat, ejecting through a half-formed
J-field. I\'ll decide what to do with that plot thread later.

Ten days later the Venturer flops out of Jspace in the right place, but
with a crew suffering varying degrees of Jump sickness and a ship needing
repairs. Later, while the ship is in dock, Footloose staggers out. She\'s
just about dead in the water, not responding to signals. The short-handed
dock authority gives the characters a shuttle and sends them out as rescue
party in return for a reduction in the reapir bills (neat adventure hook,
huh?)

Boarding Footloose, the characters find chaos. Cut bulkheads, welded doors,
hull damage.
\'Alien\' comes to mind. A crewman is found locked in the captain\'s cabin -
welded in.  
Another is hiding in a galley cupboard. The skipper and Astrogator are
barricaded into the bridge with all the weapons from the ship\'s locker. All
these characters are dehydrated, suffering from Jumpsickness and advanced
psychosis. They\'re scared of each other. The chief engineer is dead, the
characters are told. The Pilot spaced Engineering and killed him. Nobody
knows why and she\'s missing.


The characters, now on paranoia overload, search the ship. Passing a
doorway, Lewis fails a perception roll and gets crowned with a big spanner.
Firing by reflex he cuts his assailant in half. The Chief Engineer, who\'d
managed to get a suit on and cut his way into the hull (hence the damage).
He was completely insane - and also now dead, so he can\'t offer any
information, but they pieced together his scribbled notes.

He speaks of a \'psionic parasite\' that entered the ship through the
weakened Jump field from \'somewhere else\'. It possessed the steward (the
guy locked in the cabin), then transferred hosts. The engineer decided to
kill all the other crew to get rid of it - but it can transfer hosts at
will. Nobody can resist it.

Paranoia reaches new levels. The characters manage to enter the darkened
cargo bay, where they guess the missing pilot/possessee is holed up. The
engineer\'s notes say he managed to shoot her, but she\'s still alive.

In the bay, the characters eventually confront the pilot. She\'s dying of a
gunshot wound. But she\'s built some kind of electronic gizmo and rigged it
to the cargo lift shaft. She holds a pistol not quite pointed at the
characters, a manic light in her eyes. Lewis is an ex-Marine holding a
laser rifle. 

Players, \'Shoot, Lewis!\'
The pistol comes up, the pilot lurches forward towards the machine.
Players, \'Shoot, Lewis!\'
Lewis tracks the laser rifle to her, to the gizmo. "Will my laser rifle
destroy the machine?"
"Oh yes."
The pilot rests a bloody hand on the machine, reaches painfully for a
switch panel.
Players, \'Shoot, Lewis!\'
Lewis: "Drop the gun! We\'re here to help!"
Players, \'Shoot, Lewis!\'
The pilot throws the switch, steps weakly back and slumps into the
elevator. The machine begins to hum.
Players, \'Oh NO! Shoot, Lewis! Shoot shoot shooooooot!\'
Lewis tracks to the machine, takes up trigger slack. But something\'s wrong
here.
The pilot raisses her weapon. Lewis aims at her. The pistol continues to
rise, to aim at her own temple. 
It trembles, as she tries to pull the trigger but somehow can\'t.
She points to the machine with her bloody left hand. Lewis begins to change
aim again....
The pistol comes round to point at him. Just as Lewis shoots the pilot in
the chest, killing her instantly, he sees the pistol trembling - she knew
she couldn\'t shoot, but tried. Why?

The penny drops. The parasite was kept out of the ship by the
electromagnetic field of the Jdrive. It got in because of Larsen\'s
fiddling. The pilot managed to build a field generator and used the
elevator shaft to contain the entity. If it has no host - like she\'s dead,
and it\'s trapped, it\'ll die.
The pilot was a borderline psionic, and managed to fight the entity. But it
wouldn\'t let her kill herself so she made lewis do it.

But if he\'s shot the machine instead.....

Isn\'t Jspace fun!

About as many as they would find down at the starport anyway?

Propably not. Well-known ships on a regular schedule could propably get
clearance on radio messages from their captains. There might still be
spot checks in slack periods, not for anti-piracy reasons, but for customs
inspection.

If the refuelling station has adequate defenses they would propably be
allowed to refuel immidiately (and be inspected while that took place).

Inspections scheduling would go by the convenience of those who do the
scheduling, ie. the inspectors, so the next ship available would be the
next ship inspected.

1) Would that be a bad thing?
2) No, they would know where a tiny fraction of the patrol ships were
   stationed. It keeps coming back to this: Piracy (and smuggler)
   suppression is a question of assets available vs. number of places
   you have keep under observation. And in a Traveller universe with a 
   few high-population worlds the assets are many and the places are
   few.

This is not the case. Prior to the Rebellion the largest corsair bands
were not all that big, and if they were a problem, the Imperium could
easily deal with them. A massed attack on an Imperial world would make
life very difficult for the surviving corsairs as they were hunted down 
by Imperial forces and barred from their usual markets by Vargr governments
anxious not to get into a shooting war with the Imperium.

Do you base your opinion on specific economic calculations of the effect
on starship traffic? If so, I would love to see them. If not... well, 
IMNSHO the cost would not be excessive (And, no, I haven\'t made any
specific analysis, but I guess I could whip up one... some day... when I 
get the time... ;-)

That\'s just what David has been arguing for, but I don\'t buy it. If such
ships were common (or even rare) the authorities would try to stop them
if they could. And given the Traveller economics, they can.

>also why steal the cargo if you couls HI-JACK a ship for resale or re use?

Only way you can board a ship is when its maneuver drives are inoperative.
Making them inoperative has a tendency to damage the ship around them a
bit. And, of course, if pirates are common the merchants will be armed
and fighting back, inflicting multi-million credit damage back at the
pirate.

Damn few. It just isn\'t profitable enough when compared to the risk.

Well, that turns out not to be the case. The Imperium does have the man-

This only works when the foreign government is at war with the Imperium.
As soon as Articles of Peace are signed the privateers has to cease their
activity.

Yes, but adjusting for detection and weapon ranges, the US have less
assets, comparatively speaking, than the Imperium and FAR more places
to guard.

Correct me if I\'m wrong, but previous discussions have indicated that the
variability in Jump time, navigation et al may lead to you coming out quite
a long way (100,000s of km) from your intended destination. Secondly, if you
use the mass of the main star to determine 100 diameters, I find that some
habitable worlds are sufficiently inside this to require several DAYS of
in-system travel to reach them. That\'s suddenly an awful lot of area to
patrol... (I calculated these diameters years and years ago, from the Scouts
book data, but I believe they\'re still correct).

Please don\'t get me wrong - I think piracy is a rarity by CT days (try
telling that to the Vargr...)

Andy ;-)

And as to the "Aslan and Varge" book, it should also include the Graytch,
and if they\'ve mis-spelt Vargr then I\'m going to sue them. :-) (Humour,

Since one of the ways to cause a misjump is to jump while in a
gravitational field (of significant strength), if you could manage
to throw small black holes or neutronium rocks at your opponents while
they jump, you could cause them to misjump.

Of course, if you have that kind of technology, you could just
throw them at your opponents well before they jump and watch the

I\'ve seen a number of people say this, but I don\'t know of any shops
that refuse to carry T4 on the basis of quality.  Similarly people say
that the Foss artwork is rubbish, yet the vast majority of people I\'ve
shown T4 to (and that\'s quite a few) have liked the artwork.

Extrapolating your personal experience of perhaps only two or three
shops to the entire market is something people do all the time.  It
doesn\'t make it valid.  The only people who really know how T4 is
selling are IG.

Which brings up a point ... just why do grav tanks look like normal tanks
anyway? [I mean in the illustrations, of course.] Look at the cover of
FF&S, with those Trepida (sp?) grav tanks. Kewl looking, sure, but so are a
lot of mecha. I have a hard time believing that a slab with a big turret on
top is the best configuration for an airborne vehicle.

And its not just the Trepida -- look at 101 Vehicles by DGP, for example.

Well, since starships are pretty much _never_ as dense as planets, I\'d
guess it would have to be at least two or three times the size of the
earth to mass as much as the earth, which might generate it\'s own gravity
to one or so gee, somewhere within it\'s structure.

The bigger problem is what would you do with a planet sized ship? If
you\'re insane enough to want to _try_ to make it jump capable, it\'ll do
things like drain the Pacific Ocean to get enough fuel for jump 1!

What are you talking about?

People have complained that T4 is too basic, especially coming off TNE. 
It\'s the right speed for me, and I\'d like to see more optional rules for
detail, but it is a far cry from TNE\'s overcomplexity.

QSDS is a pretty simple system.  It\'s as simple as the ship design
process in CT, albeit a little more accurate.

Traveller, and T4 for that matter, doesn\'t have to be gearheaded if you
don\'t want it to be.  I buy, but rarely use, the gear head supplements.

There is no reason for it to be so in your campaign.  Just don\'t buy the
gear head supplements.

How does one book kill a game system
IMHO FF2 was the best book of them all, if you don\'t like it, don\'t use it.

They are called Jump Projectors and they existed in MT and probably CT.
 For some reason they didn\'t make the jump to TNE or T4. Someone on the
TNE mailing list was trying to come up with rules for them in TNE. I
think it may have been Roger Myhre aka Starwolf.  ( But I may be wrong)

Yes; encoding the waveform appropriately provides some covert capability,
and the different pulse repetition intervals (i.e. pulse frequencies) give
you longer unambiguous ranges, i.e.

I guess this was my main point really; the resolution on small space targets
will not be good because of the wavelengths involved (as mentioned by
someone in a previous e-mail in order to get the long ranges...).

>My feeling why most people want to keep actives is because they do not want

I\'d like to be realistic myself; I\'m just trying to work out whether the
general declaration about passives beating actives is true in all
situations, whether it be laser, lidar, radar, or whatever. :-)

Presumably at some point this has been discussed to death on the gdw-beta
list or somesuch, i.e. do the FF&S2 rules (combined with current sensor
rules) clearly show that passives are better than actives?

Intelligent squidoids some 2-2.5 meters long  living on water world at the
edge of the empire.  Imperial citizens.  [JTAS 16]

>Shi\'awei	Chaosheo/Star Lane (Deneb 0130)

Current IISS doctrine discourages interstellar contact between the Imperium
and sophonts below tech level 5. In fact, Imperial law forbids unlicensed
trade with such primitive populations. Exceptions to this rule occur,
however, one being the case of Chaosheo.
	The natives, the Shi\'awei, are a race of bulky aquatic sophonts who
live near the geothermal vents in the sea floor. In appearance they are
bulky, bullet-shaped creatures with four evenly spaced arms. The heat given
off by the vents supports their life cycle and affords an opportunity for
rudimentary metal-working. Thus, despite the rigors of their environment,
the Shi\'awei have been able to slowly progress to tech level 11.
	The IISS had long been aware of the Shi\'awei, but the Scouts judged
them unready for contact and interdicted the system. The interdiction was
broken in 1073 when the Arean Transport starliner Ishgarlu misjumped and
crashed in Chaosheo\'s oceans. IISS observers watched as the Shi\'awei
explored the wreck, encountering several live humans in the process. The
Scouts were forced to step in.
	Since 1073, a simple landing facility has been built for incoming
starships; Chaosheo\'s travel code has been  upgraded from Red to Amber.
Trade with Shi\'awei is limited, but the Scouts have been busy learning more
about the biology and sociology of Chaosheo\'s fascinating inhabitants.

>Thorellians	Thorell/Nicosia (Old Expanses 0231)

  The native race of Thorell is well adapted to its near-vacuum world,
although archaeologists and geologists maintain the atmosphere was thicker
at one time. Thorellians are a burrowing race, built long and low, with six
limbs. They can see an electromagnetic spectrum from green through
microwaves.
	  Many interconnecting burrows make up a city, which is synonymous
with  a Thorellian nation. there are at least 300 such nations plus smaller
groupings and loners on the planet. Territorial disputes are common but
usually non-violent.
	  Thorell is a Scout Service Red Zone, interdicted until the
natives progress sufficiently to enter the interstellar community. [TD12]

I\'ve not managed to arrange anything with Colin at 2nd Games Galore yet; I
chatted to him at Euro GEN CON but life has been a little hectic since then.
I am *hoping* that the BITS products (listed below) and mostly created by
CORE members will become more generally available overseas (and in the UK)
through professional distributors in the near future. I can\'t promise this
yet; we\'re in discussions at the moment; it\'s hard to make the BITS products
at a sufficiently low price to make it worthwhile going through
distributors, but I\'d like many more people to have opportunity to get hold
of them.

>On a different topic: What are the chances of BITS accepting members

We have members in Spain and elsewhere in Europe, so anyone\'s welcome,
provided they can accept the BITS newsletters by e-mail and can pay me in UK
pounds for membership (a one-off application fee of five pounds, with no
subsequent fee, i.e. it\'s effectively life membership).

         Traveller product from the first black books to FF&S2,
         giving details of authors, size, contents, etc. etc.
         - invaluable to any collector) :-)
Dulinor Software Suite (by Jo Grant)
        (Character generation, astrography, world mapping and a dice-roller,
         all intended for use with the T4 rules)
Scouts Badges
        (we made up scout suits for EGC using \'proper\' printed
         cloth badges and visitors to our stand were sufficiently
         impressed that they wanted to give us money for the badges, so
         we\'re doing a few with customer-selected custom ID numbers
         on them, etc., i.e. have your name or army number on a scout badge!)
All 101 books are 4.50 UKP, excluding postage; badges 2-4UKP, Bib is 8.50
UKP, Dulinor is 5.00 UKP; c. 10% reductions apply for all BITS members,
except on badges)
I\'m working on releasing works based on our tournament scenarios, since
these seemed particularly popular at EGC this year, especially the fun one
which combined Red Dwarf with the original Travellers from White Dwarf mag! :-)

    'body' => 'Let\'s look at the arguements.

1) Piracy can\'t exist, because the pirates have nothing to gain.  

From a straight point of view, this can be the toughest to argue, because
it\'s true.  A pirate with a ship is already a rich man.  What has he to
gain or lose?

So how does he get the ship?  If it\'s hijacked, selling it could be a
tough thing.  In my campaign, the group is getting ready to sell thier
free trader and move up to a larger ship.  Until the title is researched
and verified, they won\'t get one credit.  However, I don\'t think they\'ll
be too upset, the salesperson stands to make a significant commission.
The financing bank will be putting them up in a 4 star hotel until their
ship financing is verified...  But that would make things...difficult for
a pirate.  Very few people would be able to purchase a ship with funds on
hand.  

So, selling the ship may not be an option.  Selling cargoes, however, is a
fairly easy process, and unlike ships, they can be purchased for cash...

Also, what are the motivations?  Someone who has a purpose may not be
interested in cashing in the ship.  Perhaps the charactor has a grudge
against a specific company or world or whatever, and is only hunting their
ships?  There are many examples of fanatics (unfortunately) that we can
use to illustrate this.

Or perhaps our corsair has the equivalent of a letter of marque...Just
because two worlds (or corporations) are members of the Imperium doesn\'t
mean that they have to like each other.  While a \'hot war\' may not be
permitted, \'black\' actions such as preying on each others merchant traffic
may be overlooked.

2) Piracy can\'t exist, because of the patrols.

This is also a tough one.  I ran the numbers for a response time for a 4G
patrol cruiser to get out to the 100 D point for a UWP size 6 world - 51
minutes.  Not a lot of time.

Of course, there has to be a Patrol Cruiser in orbit for this to occur.

This is where you really have to look at the industrial base of a sector.
Class A and B starports _build_ spacecraft and starships.  Bad JuJu for a
pirate, and operations inside these systems would have to be very
carefully planned indeed.  For everyone else, the ships must be imported.
The maintenance and repair facilities for these ships will have to be
imported.  The personnel manning these ships will very likely have to be
imported. (Can you say mercenaries?) But, it really comes down to, it\'s
not how many ships can a system support, but how many ships can the sector
starports turn out?

There is also the matter of the composition of the Navy.  While 1,000 dTon
ships and smaller are ideal for custom patrols and anti-piracy work, they
tend to get chewed up and spit out in major fleet engagements.  Larger
ships, while fitting into the mission of the Imperial Navy, tend to be
impractical for serious piracy suppression.  (I\'d run, wouldn\'t you?)

Resoure allocation will be a concern - no matter which era your campaign
plays in.  As long as piracy is a minor concern, keeping in mind that a
1:36 misjump chance is considered acceptable, how much of your resources
are you going to throw at it?  Every ship that a Class C, D, or E system
has to buy is credit that flows _out_ of the system.  Every person that
mans and/or maintains the ships are skill sets that are not being used to
generate credit either in the industrial base, or through taxation/duties
or whatever.   (tho\' some would argue that protecting the merchants
encourages growth, and thus generates income - IMHO it is indirect at 
best, and not measurable)

Finally, the discussion has focussed concentration of forces around the
mainworld.  What about the rest?  Admittedly, the bulk of traffic will be
going to the system mainworld, but there is no reason why a merchant could
not be chartered to deliver to one of the other worlds in the system
instead, or to a space station somewhere in the system.  And, as I have
pointed out in other posts, intra-system traffic is an excellent source of
income for the serious corsair - even (or especially) in systems with
Class A and B starports.

I\'m not that familiar with them, since (in MT) they\'re higher than

they have to use gravitational waves?

Earlier you mentioned that there should be one vacc suit per
passenger/crewmember plus some extras.

Instead, may I propose that there be one vacc suit per crew member plus 1
mobile life support system (ie vacc suit, rescue ball, mobile low berth,
etc...) for each passenger?  Many passengers will not be able to suit
themselves and, in an emergency, there will not be time to wait for a crew
member to assist.  Most anyone can be taught to jump into a rescue ball,
tho...

Other things for the list:

Sufficient cold light sticks to illuminate the bridge, engineering, and
sick bay (if installed) for an extended period of time (say 96 hours)

Filter masks, respirators, and combo mask for each member of the crew.
Filters made available for each High or Mid passenger.

One (1) Survival Still

One (1) Atmosphere Tester

Goggles (1 per crewmember)

Survival Kit (1 per 4 passenger berths as per CSC)

   So not having a rule to determine what would happen if a
tank...oops!  Sorry, tanks weren\'t covered in the basic manuals.  OK, if
an ATV shot at a scout ship or any of a hundred of things not covered by
the basic rule books represents flexiability.  Hmmm...the absence of
rules as flexibility; now I know where people get the idea that design
flaws are really features.

   Nothing in the rules books for MegaTraveller, TNE, or MMTraveller
says that you have to use any of the design rules to design anything. 
The rules are merely there to accomodate those that do.

   An interesting concept, except that starships are nothing more than
really big vehicles, and all really big vehicles have enough internal
volume to spare to allow for access to engines without having to exit
the vehicle.  An M-1A1 (or LeClerc, etc.) tank (clearly a vehicle) could
be designed so that the crew could get access to the engine
compartment.  Designers don\'t do this as a practical matter because of
safety considerations (smoke from burning engines has been determined to
be hazardous to your health).

will be nice having the 30 odd pages of new material handy. I appreciate
your attitude towards those of us who bought the original products and this
gives me hope for the continued health and future of Traveller.

Which is why they attack by suprise.  I would say that if you have
two ships of equal ability one pulls up close and gets a suprise 
attack in, it\'s not a fair fight.

Yeah, the problem is that you are talking about dispersing them through
out the Spinward Marches, which we have aleady established negates their
military value.

Well, the price of insurance drops to reflect the low probability of 
piracy.  Having to waste fuel and time on every jump doesn\'t.

Why would the government demand it if trade didn\'t want it.  It\'s not
 like military ships have problems with piracy.

The answer is also that the cost of insurance reflect the odds of the
disaster you are insuring against.  If the odds of you loosing a million
dollars is only one in a million, then insurance can be offered for a 
few dollars.  This is why that flight insurance at the airports is so
cheap.

I don\'t think it taks 1/1000th of your panetary defenses, as I have

elsewhere.

Well, it will be.  Even the fuel you purchase from the star port comes
from
the gas giant, someone else just gets it.  (Ignoring the question of
wether
everyone would use gas giants or buy from the star port).  Also, the
pirate
doesn\'t need to be lurking in the exact spot.  Just like any other
system,
he can spot you on the way in or out.

I don\'t agree.  You have used the most trivial kind of smuggling to
characterize
all kinds (which can include prohibited weapons, nasty drugs,
biologicals for 
terroists, etc.).  Yes, air-port make an effort to stop hijackings that
is
probably out of line with the threat (you would probably save more lives
spending 1/2 the money on stopping traffic accidents).  If you want to 
suppose the Imperium has a similar view of piracy, that is OK.  But that
is 
simply a another spin on the problem, not reasoning that invalidates an 
Imperium  with piracy.

I did.  I\'ve pointed out that you will need a couple of dozen for each
world
and will need to protect any world in a system that supports trade
(which
includes the main world, the gas giants, and all other worlds with other
populations, mining, etc. on them).  Then you need to do this in every 
system in the Imperium.  You also need those patrols big enough to stop 
the pirates from doing simple things like ganging up into groups of two
or three and/or attacking by suprise (ie you need a a force that can
deal 
with any worst case senario, which is the way it usually works.)

You have given reasons why you don\'t agree with these (like you vision
of legally required departure arrival points) and I have told you why
I don\'t think it would necessarily work this way.

The passive sensor rules in FFS2 are based on many hours of painstaking
sensor modelling (incorporating realistic optics and detector design 
(for TL-8), background models with three components (thermal emission from
optics, scattered light from zodiacal dust, thermal emission from 
zodiacal dust) and signature models with three componments (reflected
sunlight, IR emission from hot radiators, IR emission from warm hull) and
reasonable technological extrapolation.)

I could do this isince I\'m an IR/visible astronomer.  

The active sensor rules in FFS2 were basically Made Up, due to lack of time
and lack of expertise. The scaling laws (range goes as (size)^2 * (power^2))
were right, but the base size was made up. I tweaked it to make active
sensors moderately competetive with passive sensors - generally the range
will be a point less under "normal" conditions, but active sensors are
still useful for hunting dark, powered-down targets. I *think* this is an
overestimate, but I\'d love to see someone do some "real" TL-8 numbers. 
So, FFS2 does show that passives are (slightly) better than actives but
not overwhelmingly. I\'m pretty sure I overstated how useful active sensors
are for precise fire control - but without good estimates of how well
tricks like aperture synthesis will work this is hard to quantify.


One important niche in which actives do very well in the current rules is
LIDAR; it can be hard to fit a passive array big enough to do good fire control
on small dark targets into a small ship, but you  can fit plenty of good
LIDAR systems.

Overall I\'m fairly proud of the sensor rules...I think they\'re worth 
taking a look at.

Megatraveller had the jump projector weapon system. 

This somehow reminded me of an old MT campaign. I was helping one of the
players roll up a character and he kept rolling Heavy Weapons. My friend,
mildly stoned at the time, kept writing it as Heay Weapons (omitting the V).
This lead to an unofficial motto for our group: (done in a tone of voice
that indicates extreme pleasure upon discovery) He-e-e-ey! Weapons!

Hmmm That\'s a toughie.  *Second* Printing errata is at either;

http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/errata1.html

or

http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/TNE/errata/ffs.errata.gdw.txt

Joe Heck\'s Archive, but he doesn\'t have the First edition errata.

I used a couple of (fairly thorough) methods and found no sign of the
original 1st edition errata.  All the errata I have found is dated Dec. 7,
1994 (A day which will live in..?) and specifically for the second edition.

I think I *have* Challenge 75.  Get back to me on Monday  in private email
if you haven\'t got ahold of the errata by then.  I\'m sure we can work
something out.

T4 has been a flop?  Perhaps it has been.  There are three major RPG sellers
in my area.  Of these three two carry the T4 line.  Of those two, I go to one
consistently because of its location.  It continues to carry new Traveller
stuff.  As a result, I buy new Traveller stuff there.  Apparently, due to
decreasing stock, I\'m not the only one who\'s buying the stuff.

The one major gaming place that doesn\'t carry T4 only carries AD&D, White
Wolf stuff, Heavy Gear, and Deadlands with limited wall space.  Obviously
they carry only the major sellers (around 65% of their RPG shelf space is
devoted to the White Wolf stuff).

So, at least here in Philadelphia, its not quite "Most stores won\'t carry
it".

Well, I think that in any situation like this, the detractors will always be
screaming louder than the people who like the game and use it.  Especially
when the tone of the mailing list often seems so damned venomous towards T4,
which is ashame.

I recently purchased the T4 rules and was actually pretty impressed.  I like
the simplicity and elegance of most of it.  I have my problems with the
percentages and odds for task resolution, but T4.1 seems to fill that hole.
 I expected from the way everyone was carrying on that the T4 rules would be
rife with errata and too flawed to use.

Well, it wasn\'t the case.

FFS2 came out in some parts of the country before here due to the UPS strike.
 I read the reviews of it before I bought it.  The reviews were pretty mixed.
 I went ahead and got it anyway and had no _major_ problems with the book.
 I\'m happy to have bought the book.

Before I got involved with this list I purchased the Milieu 0 sourcebook.  I
got on the list and people were saying that it is unusable because it is so
flawed.  I use it just fine.  Granted, the sector map and data is a little
screwed, but other than that the book is, IMHO excellent.

I\'m starting a campaign this Monday starting in 1105 in the upper corner of
the Daibei sector.  The best way to describe the tone is "_The Usual
Suspects_ meets Jabba the Hutt".  For this game I will be using T4/T4.1
rules.  There\'ll probably be bumps in the road.  Starship combat is going to
be one of them I\'m sure.  However, when all is said and done, I like T4/T4.1.
 I like the fact that Marc Miller is so accessible and agreeable and includes
his players in the design process.  I like the fact that the folks involved
in designing the technical architecture are right there if you have a
question.

So, I don\'t know really.  Whatever.  I forget where I was going with this
message.  I just know, however, the negativity around here gets way too high
sometimes.

Drop the emergency Vacc Suits for the passengers. Go with Rescue balls, they
require less training and would be easier for non-trained passengers to use.
They also pose less of a security risk for the crew.
In any case the low berth passengers don\'t need Vacc Suits, though Rescue
 Balls have a small chance of being used.
I\'d also have a tendency for Rescue balls in the hallways too.
I\'d require at least one-two crew (depending on crew size and Tech Level) to
be in a suit at while on duty.



<<Launch

the original included a shotgun and some ammo).

There\'s a (posthumous?) sequel just out, by Miller and Terry Bisson,

One of the more popular is to use d10 for damage dice instead of d6.
Many people complain that combat isn\'t lethal enough, with d10 it is
fairly deadly.  Also make sure to use the quick kill rule.  (If NPCs
take more damage to the head or chest than their con from one hit, they
are dead, PCs take double damage instead.  Personally I make it double
damage for everyone)

Franklin Cain has sent a few house rules to the TNE-RCES list they are
on my web pages in the GAIL section.

I only see three time periods in Imperial history when Pirates are
really active. When I say Pirates, I mean guys in spaceships who go
around stealing, plundering, looting and pillaging from other people,
they don\'t just steal ships, they attack planets, space stations and
anything else they feel like.

Three Periods:
1) During the long night, after civilization has collapsed. Ships from
worlds which haven\'t lost star flight can raid other planets. This can
be organized, or criminal elements from these planets.  The Pirates
will also prey on the few ships that survive, although those ships will
probably be well armed 

2) During the Rebellion. When war broke out, much of the force used to
prevent piracy was destroyed.  Many of the pirates won\'t be guys in a
hopped up Free Trader, but guys in a 50,000 ton cruiser, which decided
to desert.  Also as the war waged on, many warships would be running
short of supplies and would have to "acquire" supplies from civilians,
either their civilians or the other side\'s civilians.  Some of the
nicer commanders would give out chits redeamable for money after the
war was over, (Realistically these are only valuable if that side won
the war)  others would just take things.  
Hard Times give details on several corsair bands, and also gives more
details about different types of pirates ie Rippers, Corsairs, Vikings and Pirates.

3) During the Collapse. These pirates will be pretty much like the
pirates of the Long Night. I guess you can also have Vampire ships
coming around and stealing humans for slaves to run their ships also. 
The Guild is a organization of Pirates, slavers and normal merchants.

From countless sessions at the wargaming table, I have come to the
conclusion that grav tanks will spend most of their lives within a meter or
two of the ground.  Any higher, and they become scrap metal.  While palying
the Zhodani, I once lost the better part of an armored battalion crossing a
river.  The damned Impies had several powerful lasers set up to fire the
length of the river, and caught me in my sprint.  That, and severla other
lessons both applied and recieved, taught me that cover is still the
tankers\' friend.

This makes a good case for the traditional big-turret design.  The tank can
unmask and fire while keeping the crew and power-plant behind a wall of
dirt (very good armor) and out of sight.

IMC (in my campaign), Ships documentation, regardless of where they are
purchased, are administered from the subsector capital.  All ship\'s
payments flow to the capital.  Once the owner has taken possession of
the ship, all records are forwarded to the capital, and the ship\'s
payment account is established.  If the ship is going to be operating out
of that subsector, arrangements have to be made to transfer title
information to the new subsector.  

When the ship is financed, two months advance payments will be deposited
in an account at the capital, and the actual payments are withdrawn from
that.  Payments can be recieved at any Class A, B, or C starport and are
then credited to that account, once they arrive at the capital.  The
ship-owner is responsible for insuring that he/she increases the amount
held in the account should travel times exceed 8 weeks.  If that account
ever overdraws - then repossession proceedings begin.  It is important to
note that, while the title may be transferred from S/S to S/S, the only
way to transfer the loan is by renegotiating it with a new bank.

Ship\'s Weaponry are administered at the S/S level, but are authorized at
the sector level.  Civilian Lasers and Missiles are mostly a rubber-stamp
item.  As long as the purchaser-of-record does not have a record of
violence, has ship\'s papers, and will sign a end-use statement there is no
problem.  The necessary permits must be carried by the ship, and are
copied to the ship\'s record held at the SubSector Capital and copied to
the Sector Capital as well.  

Military-class weapons require a background check, yearly inspections by
the Navy (done during the overhaul, gun \'camera\' records are inspected at
that point) and are only authorized to be used in specific subsectors as
itemized in the permits.  Copies of these permits are held at the Sector
Capital and each affected subsector capital.  Ship Transponder IDs for
MilWeap-authorized ships are also included in the classified military
library data installed in Imperial Warships.

Nuclear and BioWar items are not authorized for civilian or para-military
units.  Lethal Chemical munitions require specific authorization.
Non-lethal chemical munitions (specifically warheads and artillery shells)
are difficult (read expensive) to obtain except from military
clearinghouses.

\'Salvage\' recorders are secure instruments used to verify complience with
salvage laws.  (Mostly revolving around there _not_ being survivors before
you claim the hulk as salvage :). I have these installed by default on all
ships.  Basically, all communications, both audio and video, can be routed
through this device - each is recorded with a timestamp.  24-hours of
record, is required to satisfy the admiralty courts.  Data from these
recorders can be erased \'in toto\' by anyone (so you can wipe the recorders
if the sensor anomoly turns out to be nothing), but the entire memory core
must be pulled and placed in a \'reader\' for the data to be extracted
(reviewed).  Proprietary hardware and a \'formidible\' computer roll is
required to alter the data on this system.  Each memory core can hold
about 72 hours of data.

    'body' => 'I\'m looking for some constructive comments about the following plot for a 
campaign I\'m starting next week with some friends of mine in college.  I\'m
using the TNE game system, but I\'m using my own background & history.

Basic Premise:
It\'s about 2300AD, Earth is TL12/TL13, and mankind has colonized a few of the
nearer stars (using the Near Star List from GDW\'s 2300AD & a little program I
wrote to chart jump routes).  No sentient life has been found yet, but there are
a few worlds with native life.  A UN Scout Service vessel ran across a veritable
garden world orbiting Zeta Tucanae 2, a G2V about 23 ly from Earth.  The PCs are
the crew of a follow-up survey ship dispatched to conduct a general survey and
limited goal-oriented survey (a la World Tamer\'s Handbook).  This much
information the PCs have from the get-go.

A quick aside -- the plot from here on came up while my fiancee and I were having
breakfast at a local restaurant.  The players are involved in a rotating game
group, so there are three other RPGs being run, and we take turns each Friday
running a game.  The other games are sci-fi ish or modern-era (White Wolf,
Rifts, Cyberpunk), so I decided on Traveller over Mythus (easier for me to teach
them).  The group is largish (8 players + ref) and tends to be chaotic.

What I\'m throwing at them:
Their starship, the first ship in a series of new, shiny TL13 survey vessels,
is parked in orbit over Zeta Tucanae 2.  After a basecamp facility is dropped
from orbit, the UNSS _Discovery_ gets hit by a largish rock.  Just moments
before
the impact, the survey specialist will see a grainy image of a crop circle on
his displays.  Before anyone can do much other than speculate, the rock hits
the _Discovery_.  The ensuing damage is substantial -- the engineering section
gets hit, frying the jump drive, knocking the fusion reactor off line, and
causing a fair-sized explosion as the LH2 tanks catastrophically rupture and
lose their contents to the engineering section and space.  To add insult to
injury, the impact ruptures some interior bulkheads, causing the atmosphere to
leak into space.  The _Discovery_ is tumbling and blacked out.
 Normally, this wouldn\'t be a problem, but the ship\'s boat was wrenched from its
grapple by (hand waving reasoning inserted here).  Fortunately, there is a life
boat.  Unfortunately, the life boat\'s automated orbit-to-surface program ends
up rotating into the way of the tumbling _Discovery_, causing significant damage
(and forcing some one to manually fly it towards the surface).
When the crippled life boat finally smashes into ZT2 and the shaken and battered
crew tumble from the wreckage, I throw a few curves at them:

 1) The world is indeed inhabited by sentient beings.  The continent that the
PCs crashed on is occupied by a TL2/TL3 civilization of Greys (the aliens that
are so popular with UFO abductions, etc).  Their culture is similar to a
medieval Northern European civilization, but they are vegetarians (they use some
animals for labor (draft animals, herding animals)) with very advanced holistic
crop techniques.  The life boat skidded across a farmer\'s wheat field, destroying
a crop circle pattern the farmer had created.
 2) There are dragons.  Not the big, D&D things, but smaller dinosauroids that
range in size from medium birds to large dogs.  The first one they
encounter is a
herding dragon, which is used to herd the farmer\'s cattle.
 3) The crop circles are part of a Samhain-like fall celebration.  Various
farmer/artists create these patterns in local contests.
 4) Just to play up the medieval nods, since about a third of the players are
active in SCA and all of them have played D&D, there are orcs on the world,
too.
Not the dumb, generic things in other games, but a fully developed
civilization.

 A lot of the things I\'m throwing in are intentionally cliche in other
games or
whatnot.  I\'m throwing them together to see how it works out -- a lot of big,
alien humans crashing in some poor farmer\'s field.  The local farming
village is
named after the Artesian well in the center of town, which is surrounded by
some
bushes with beautiful flowers (yes, the village is named Rose Well).

 Further down the line (and less thoroughly developed idea-wise) are the 
following concepts:

1) The Greys are not native to ZT2.  They are, infact, the survivors of a race
of star farers whose big mothership crashed millenia ago.  After a
technological
slide to TL0ish, they slowly are re-learning, but they\'ve lost their origins.
2) The Greys crashed on a southern continent that was heavily populated by the
(native) orcs, and were forced to flee north.
3) The only remnants of their history is preserved in the Grey religion, with
certain icons (like a flying saucer?, crop circle art, and memories of a
descent
from the heavens) preserved.
4) The Grey mothership will have sufficient materiel to repair the _Discovery_
and return the party to civilization, but it will take some time for the
PCs to
get this far.
5) Most of the players tend to be very pro-technology.  Unfortunately, all of
the cool toys they are packing for this survey mission use batteries.  So far,
only one player has voiced the thought that the cool electrothermal chemical
guns and lasers are electrically powered and there may be instances where that
is bad (like when they run out of power and no rechargers are nearby).

Well, I think that more or less covers the ideas I have right now.  I admit
that
there are a lot of things I\'m throwing in that are going to cause the
players to
groan.  I also (hope) that these ideas will merge together well enough for
it to
work.  None of the players (other than my fiancee) have the slightest clue
what
kind of curves I\'m going to throw at them (yet).

I will probably put a lot of these ideas on a web page once I get my account
changed to include a web page.  If anyone has any questions or comments about
all of this, please respond.

   The presumption is that vehicles like the Trepdia spend a lot of
their time very near the ground (flying up to hundreds of kilometers per
hour while they are at it), thus the standard tank configuration would
still have some validity.

   If you are looking for somethng more "aircraft-like", then you want
an attack speeder.  Using FF&S, I have designed a whole range of these
beasts from TL 12-16.  My assumption about the essential difference
between the two (aside from configuration) is that attack speeders would
be faster than their grav tank counterparts, have a somewhat thinner
armor skin, and would have missiles as their main armament with a rapid
fire plasma or fusion gun (the equivalent of a minigun) used for smaller
targets.

Harold

Harold\'s TNE House Rule Fixes

1) Use D10 instead of D6 to resolve fire combat.  This seems to fix the
problem some people have with weapon lethality.

2) Melee combat is resolved in 1 second turns instead of 5.  This is
still experimental, but seems to have worked out quite well so far. 
Important thing is to keep pushing the player for his next action so
that he/she doesn\'t have too much time to think about it.

3) Additional rules covering "sniper shots".  These appeared in TTC #12.

4) Various mods to the trader rules because of the uniqueness of the
Terran Republic (these will appear in TTC #13).

5) The formula for calculating mass driver round weight has been altered
so that it produces rounds of less mass.  This fixes the problem of the
huge energy requirements placed on mass driver guns (which IMHO render
them inferior to CPR guns).

6) A limit on laser power of TL*50, which was first discussed on this list.

7) Additional entries in the vehicle design sequence that allow for
lighter, less bulky walker transmissions.

8) Parallel universes, time travel, and alternative timelines (these are
used *very* sparingly a la Star Trek).  The current campaign hasn\'t run
into any of these (yet).

Harold

Well, I know of a whole chain that, when T4 came out, bought at least a box (a
dozen copies) of each title *per store* (sure, it\'s only three stores, and its
only in Oz, but its a trend) -- what do they buy now? Two copies for the Sydney
store -- perhaps only one for the others. The Sydney store gets one for display
(in the hope it will be sold reasonably quickly) and one for the *sucker* who
has a definite order for it. Net loss of sales? around 30. And this is the
biggest chain on the eastern seabord ... where more than 60% of all Ozzies live.
Worse, the competition I have checked out -- though I don\'t know the managers
there as well -- all have been following the same policy ... one for the "New
Products" shelf and one for the "Traveller" section elsewhere. The only
multi-copy titles are of the very early releases. Obviously they have been burnt
by lack of sales as well.

Why? Well, I had a word with the manager (this is my FLGS, and I\'ve been buying
stuff there for over twenty years -- in fact, I\'ve been buying stuff from them
since the early 70\'s when they were still a mail order operation working out of
the then owner\'s home) and he said that the quality of the product was a major
problem and that the buyers had very soon cottoned on to this and were staying
away in droves. When I told him the news of the GURPS Traveller license, he
basically said *great* and was sure that this would boost sales, whereas he was
equally sure that IG products would not, and were unlikely ever to pick up.

As for the artwork, well, it\'s always been somewhat difficult, because of teh
ridiculous way the world is split up into "US" and "Rest of the World" copyright
areas, to get US published books here -- so there has always been (until very
recently) a preponderance of British SF Books on the market. Now, I\'be been
buying SF Books for about as long as I have Boardgames and RPGs (since 1970 and
1975, respectively), and I will *never* buy a UK pub over a US one -- the
artwork on the US version is *always* superior, even when mediocre. And why?
Well, mainly because for a long period of time Foss "artwork" dominated the
covers of UK SF paperbacks -- and Foss, IMNSHO, couldn\'t draw his way out of a
wet paper bag with a map and a compass.

As for his alleged artwork on T4 products, I have bought the ones I have bought
*DESPITE* his alleged artwork, *NOT* because of it.

OK, I\'m only one person. However, the gaming club I belong to (and have since
around 1978) has a considerable number of Traveller GMs and Players -- and,
guess what, all of the GMs (5-6) do *NOT* like Foss covers. All of them find
Foss covers to be a turn-off to a greater or lesser degree. Even the manager of
the FLGS is less than impressed with them -- mainly because they have no obvious
connection to the contents -- important when such a piss poor product is
attempting to gather sales by prompting people to pick it up off the shelf.

>Extrapolating your personal experience of perhaps only two or three

>selling are IG.

But I would suggest that the above reports are a worrying sign! And, after all,
no-one has written in and said ... "Hey, that\'s wrong! *My* FLGS has expanded
its order for Traveller and is giving it *greater* shelf display ... and it
never reaches the \'Bargain Bin\'." I agree that anecdotal evidence should be
treated with caution, but the very fact that there seems to be no such evidence
of *good* sales is a worry.

As for the people who know whether T4 is selling. Well, I think we can safely
say that it is *not* because, as we all know, IG seems to have worsening
cash-flow problems rather than improving ones. It is a dying company -- and
deservedly so -- because the backers have obviously not put enough initial
capitalisation into it. Whatever initial good feelings there were for the new
Traveller have long since been lost because of abortions such as Starships.

On the other hand, Traveller *will* survive -- but only as GURPS Traveller in
the short to medium term. For T5 -- and, hopefully, a company with backers who
actually *have a clue*, we\'ll have to wait for IG to go under ... and how long
is that going to be in the face of competent opposition (in the form of
GURPSTrav).

As I\'ve said before, PE and TLWH are the last IG products I will buy. IG has
lost me as a customer and is unlikely to ever pick me up again -- and that\'s
pretty much the case for all the GMs in the group I belong to ... for example,
none of them have purchased FF&S2 (and all -- even me, and I loathed it -- have
FF&S) and won\'t, because of the unusable nature of the product with the stuffed
equation layout. And its pretty much the same attitude for all the rest.

Nope. The sooner IG dies -- or their backers get a clue -- the better.

Kenneth,

I wrote a rather lenthy reply to this yesterday, went to post it and my
computer locked up! Unfortunately (for me) I\'ve been reduced to using a retired
386 since frying the mother board in my pentium and it has Quirks. Any way here
I go for the second time. Most of these are just thoughts, you\'ll have to
determine amounts , etc, according to your ship type and size...

On both the launch and the main ship, these should be stored near exits:

Survival Packs Containing:
Flares
Flare Gun
Visual beacon
Radio beacon
Survival rations (for at least a couple of days)
compass and/or inertial locator
Short or Long range communicator
Thermal blanket (you know the reflective kind)
Water filter/purifier (or pills, can remember the name)
Powercell/Solar heater, cooking unit
Tent
Weapon (something like the ar7 survival rifle that breaks down into a plastic
stock that floats)
Survival knife (large with fish hooks, string matchs, etc in the handle...
check out a camping catalog)
Lighter (can be something hightech but matchs will work as well)

Not part of the pack but also stored near exits:
Infaltable raft, probably with cover and visual/radio beacon attached
I usuall add medium range communicators in my ships lockers
Rope (always a GOOD thing to have around)

Other items inboard:
Gas or laser cutting torch (had a player once that modified a laser cutter into
a weapon during a hi-jack ;)
Come-alongs or chain falls (incase the ag movers fail just when that BIG part
needs to be moved)
Hull patches of various sizes, sticky on one side, located at various brightly
colored storage points around the outer hull (one note here, I tend to try and
place corridors along the outer hull on military ships, makes it easier for the
damage repair folks, but each room along the hull should have a locker
containing patches)
Some type of epoxy spray to seal larger breaches, located with the patches
Emergency lamps (battle lamps), located at easy to find locations.
Each passenger state room should contain one of the escape ballons you
mentioned before
EVA mobility unit, for outside repairs etc.

Well, that\'s it for now. Will add to it if I think of more.

   And when the infantry walk into the river, and the current carries

I tend to agree with this. By the way I haven\'t been following this thread but
has anyon mentioned the very real, very active, Asian piracy. I saw a show in
the Learning Channel about this. They protrayed them as using very small craft
to board tankers and freighters, most of which showed up later with false papers
and new names. Others passed themselves off as "boat people", and got aboard
that way.

I wish I could remember more of the details. Anyway these may not be real
relavant except to point out that whenever there\'s money to be made somebody,
somewhere will find a way!

These last few days of story telling have been great, the knid of stuff I like

I see a major problem here. Sure while on the tour you spend a couple
of weeks (14 days) visiting 14 systems. Sounds like a great way to
spend a two-week vacation, right?

But when you get back, you find out that you don\'t have a job, because
you\'ve been gone for 14 *weeks* (a bit over 3 *months*). Or e;se you
had to use 3 months of vacation time for a vacation that only lasted
two weeks for you.

Marc, you\'ve done it again.

With one swift move, like your post on the copying of out of date
material, you\'ve made a HUGE number of people happy.

I sure an glad you are taking a more active role in the new creation of
Traveller.  It seemed like those others--the dream team, if you
will--was screwing it up for you.

Look at all of this excitement!

These people are acting like this because they feel they are being
treated RIGHT.

Kudos,

I\'ve got two emergency systems for everyone on this ship--a vacc suit

Actually, the yard is the length of a piece of string in the fingers of
one outstreched arm stretched to the tip of your nose. Just like a

Battledress can just walk across the bottom. Of course, I\'ve seen a few
riverbeds that show why this can be a *bad* idea (river flows over bare
rock, and there are some *deep* cracks). Still, I suspect that an
approach marching across the bottom, with engineer units bridging the
worst parts of the bottom, would be a workable tactic in some cases. It
certainly makes it hard to shoot at you as you are crossing. :-)

I don\'t have the formulas handy, but the form of spherical co-ordinates
is basicly altitude, azimuth, and radius. Altitude is the angle between
the x-y plane and a line drawn from the point to the origin. Azimuth is
how far around from the x-axis the line is (ie azimuth is how far
clockwise from "north", altitude is how far above the horizon). And
radius is simply how far out from the origin the point is.

I can\'t find my book on astronomical calculations, which *might* have
something useful in it. <sigh>

True enough. And while it\'s *possible* to drive a grav tank supersonic,
there\'s not much point to it. So that means that a decent *subsonic*
shape is probably best. 

I\'d say an ellipsoid of some sort wou;d be best. Probably an oblate
spheroid, as that gives the most surface area when you set down (useful
if you don\'t want it sinking too deeply into the ground). 

So a grav tank would look a lot like a flying saucer with guns sticking
out. If it can rotate about the vertical axis fast enough, it doesn\'t
need a turret. And again, the oblate speroid shape helps, as it allows
you to rotate in flight without changing the effective "frontal"
surface area. 

Hmmmm... it just occurred to me that the "bottom" of an oblate spheroid
would work well as a heat shield for re-entry too! So you could deploy
the tanks from orbit during a landing. 

I *like* this idea!

I\'ve got to admit it.  I really like T4 too.  

I think there are a lot of reasons why T4 has gotten some bad press at
the start.  Some people don\'t accept new ideas and change very well. 
Some didn\'t like the task system probablilty problem you spoke of (I can
think of one person who had a REAL problem with the task system).  

And, I think that the pre-premier marketing for T4 got a lot of people\'s
hopes up--and they were dissappointed when they didn\'t receive the best,
most incredible game system EVER produced.

What we got was a good game system.  It\'s got it\'s problems, sure, but
just about every game system does.  

But, I\'ll tell you...I do know this...

I was using a House version of rules before T4 came along.  It was
basically the TNE rules system using the MT task system.

Ever since I started using T4, my games have gone from being good to
incredible.  It was the best move I could have made with my campaign and
my players.

It was a return to the simple game mechanics of CT, and it fit my play
style like a glove.

Before, everybody was having fun, but they\'d leave the game and not
think about it again until we played next.

Today, I get at least one daily e-mail from one of my four players. 
I\'ve got two players who have drawn pictures of things that happened in
the game.  I\'ve got me and one other player writing short stories about
things that happen or character backstory events.

I\'ll tell you, you don\'t get that kinda devotion and creativity from
players who are just so-so about the game.  Work, wives, life gets in
the way.

It wasn\'t happening before.



Bottom line?

The T4 rules have improved my game by allowing us to focus more on the
story and having fun with the campaign rather than putting all that
energy into die rolling and fixing a House system that merged two out of
print editions.

I like a little more detail in my game, but as T4 grows, that detail is
there (and growing) if you want it.  There\'s new combat rules in the
EA.  We use\'em.

The only big problem I have with T4 is the skills vs stats issue, and by
using my KBv2.0 system, that\'s not a problem anymore.

I\'ll say it again.  I really like T4.  I see good things coming out of
IG.  I\'m taking a more relaxed posture about it all, and I can\'t wait to
see T4.1.

All of this improvement in my campaign (the ultimate proving ground for
good rules) cannot be a coincidence.

I\'ve seen both sides of this in Houston.  My local store does the one or
two copy thing.  There\'s me and a couple of other "regulars" who buy
everything IG puts out.  After that, there\' a few sparatic sales.

Then there\'s the biggest game store in Houston, who has just taking away
some of the huge area reserved for AD&D the last 3 or 4 years (two book
cases and two wall displays) by giving one of the wall displays over to
Traveller.

Maybe this is because there have been no new AD&D items since the WotC
buy-out and they need to fill that space.  But, the point is, out of all
the other games out there, they picked Traveller to fill it.

I know this can be read in several ways.  Maybe they are trying push
slagging Traveller sales, and maybe they have high hopes for it.

But, T4 is getting good exposure in this prominent location of this
large store--so at least some of the move is a good thing.

Okay, here\'s something that really sticks in my craw, and has since FFS2 came
out...  The misprinted equations do not make the book unusable.  If they do,
I cannot understand why.  Yes, the misprinted equations are ugly.  Yes, the
misprinted equations are an eyesore.  But, really, how hard is it to replace:
<-> with an x or * in your head as you perform the equation?

C\'mon, how difficult is it to do this?

If you\'re gearheaded/mathematically competent enough to use FFS2, then you
should be competent enough to change <-> to *.  Not that hard.  I use FFS2 on
a pretty regular basis.  I have designed 2 grav vehicles, several starships,
an assault rifle, a plasma rifle, and a laser carbine.  With the exception of
a few missing segments in tables FFS2 has been completely usable.

Yes, GURPS Traveller is going to come along and sweep us all off of our feet
and everything will be wonderful forever and ever and the sun will never set
on the 3rd Imperium.  GURPS Traveller taking over is great news for the
world.  *EXCEPT* for people like myself who don\'t care for GURPS.  I *like*
T4/T4.1.  I genuinely do.  I don\'t like the GURPS system.  This is a matter
of taste, I\'ll admit.  I hope when GTrav comes out it sells a gazillion
copies.  I\'d love that.  I\'ll buy copies of the GURPS Traveller stuff (funny
how the announcement of one source book has been changed to a whole GTrav
_line_).

But, here go the facts:  When the time comes, and GTrav is released, there
will be venom and hissing and cursing:  
"How could they include the flugel-widgets?  Everyone knows they were stupid
and scientifically unrealistic!  And how could they leave out Vargr chew
toys?  Everyone knows that they\'re a cornerstone of Classic Traveller!  And
the new damage system sucks, you could never stand up to a plasma blast in
MegaTraveller!  And page 27 of Obscure-Canon-Source says that robot brains
can\'t have an intelligence of 8 or more, where do they get off?"

Yada yada yada.

I\'ll say this.  You\'re entitled to your opinions.  I agree with you on some.
 For example, I really don\'t care for Foss to much.  His paintings are way
out of scale to the Traveller universe.  He is technically competent, but the
ships are just too monolithic and ugly.  I don\'t know.  Whatever.

Kenneth,

It just struck me that the Port Authority will be inspecting the entire ship. not
just what was stolen and replaced. If you want to have a little fun, at you PC
Captain\'s expense, they will also be looking a t some or all of these things as well.

The ship\'s fire suppression system, and it\'s maintenance records,
The SHIP\'S maintenance records
Expiration dates on food, survival rations, medicines, etc.
Fire and Smoke Alarm systems
Air Quality testing systems and the environmental equipment, for out of date filters
etc., along with maintenance records.
Emergency lighting, permanently fixed as well as portable.
Warning labels on chemicals (cleaners, etc.)
Emergency procedure signs and instructions in the passenger areas.
Communications equipment
Log books, Ship\'s papers, etc.
Any and all alarms will be tested.

Admittedly most of this is trivial in game terms, but think of the expression on
their faces when the Inspector asks to see the maintenance records on the sanitary
recycler! It is the perfect opportunity to see how fast they think on their feet.

Let\'s see....

    6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2 (7e-11) -- Newton\'s Gravitational Constant "G"
	5.974e24 kg	 (6e24)  -- Mass of Earth
	7.348e22 kg	 (7e22)  -- Mass of Moon
	1.989e30 kg	 (2e30)  -- Mass of Sun
	3.986e14 m^3/s^2 (4e14)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Earth
	4.903e12 m^3/s^2 (5e12)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Moon
	1.327e20 m^3/s^2 (13e19) -- Gravitational constant times mass of Sun

So first thing, we see that the mass of the moon (which you can easily
launch ships from) is 7e22 kg. A quadrillion is only 1e12. 

A=GM/r^2

A=6.673e-11*1e12/r^2
A=66.73/r^2

So assuming your quadrillion ton ship was only 10 meters in radius (20
m diam) we get an acceleration due to gravity of .6673 or 7/100ths of a
G! I don\'t think gravity would be a problem for launching things. 

The real problem is what the mass of the ship does to *itself* in the
way of stresses and strains.

   I use the D10 *only* for fire combat, since using D10 for fist fights
tends to make them a bit too short and bloody.

   The Quick Kill rule in the TNE manual reads as follows:

   Quick Kill: Any shot which hits the chest or head may constitute a
killing shot.  Roll 1D20.  If the roll is less than or equal to the
*damage value* of the shot, the target is instantly killed except on the
roll of a 20 exactly.

   Which means if you hit somebody in the head or chest with a gauss
rifle that does 4D of damage, you would roll a D20 for quick kill and
any roll of 1-4 would result in instant death.

   A common variant to this is to multiply the damage value number by
two for all head shots (quadrupling it for an exceptional success head
shot) before rolling the D20.

   Thus, if that 4D gauss rifle hit the target in the head, the chances
for quick kill go from 4 in 20 to 8 in 20, and on an exceptional success
roll 16 in 20 (time to make funeral arrangements).

   My thoughts on PC mortality: I am not running a campaign of "The
A-Team RPG".  Use of bullets, in particular getting in the way of them
if they are flying at supersonic speeds, increase the odds dramatically
that you will have to roll a new character before the next gaming
session.  If you do not like this reality, play the engineer who is
always getting stuck back on the ship keeping the engine running.

Harold

My local games store has increased its Traveller shelf space, now two
sections 150-200mm deep,  and has a lot of supplements. Interestingly, the
rules are disappearing quickly, as are a few of the supplements like FFS2,
M0, CSC, PE... Starships and FS remain resolutely on the shelf.

I own FFS2, and am not particularly gearhead (I owned the previous FFS and
didn\'t use it). The equations are not a problem. The missing tables are
more of a problem.

>Nope. The sooner IG dies -- or their backers get a clue -- the better.

So are you saying that even if the IG material improves you are not going
to buy any new IG material? That\'s your call, but why not listen to the
reviews, or even look at the products in the store before you decide?

Anyway, this isn\'t intended as a flame, as I can understand why you feel
the way you do and felt that way myself after getting hold of starships
(worst =A315 UK I spent on an RPG supplement in the last 5 years).

Okay here\'s my take on what safety equipment the Bureau Of Starships Safety,
Health, and Transit Standards would require a starship to carry as a minimum.

1) Vacc suits: 3 per airlock (located in the airlock), 2 per driveroom
(located in the driveroom). Note that these are not \'normal\' vacc suits,
rather these are specifically designed to be used by most humaniod races
within the Imperium. This results in them being somewhat bulky and
uncomfortable (-2 on all tasks). Most crew refer to them as "Baggies" and
will only use them in emergencies.

2) Rescue Balls: 2 per stateroom (located in the stateroom), 1 per low berth
(located with the low berth), 1 per acceleration couch (located underneigth
the couch), 1 per workstation (located at the station); plus others totalling
the maximum possible crew and passenger compliment (excluding low passengers)
located at easily accessable points throughout the vessel.

3) Imperial Standard Individual Survial Kits: 1 per airlock (located on the
hull exterior at the airlock), 1 per driveroom (located in the driveroom),
1 other (located on or by the bridge or pilot\'s workstation). Note that these
are in sealed compartments, and accessing them will trip audiable (very)
alarms throughout the vessel.

4) Paramedic kits: 1 per airlock (located at the airlock), 1 per 10 passengers
or crew (located at easily accessable points throughout the vessel), 1 per
driveroom (located in the driveroom), 1 per 10 low berths (located by the low
berths, 1 other (located at or by the bridge or pilot\'s workstation).

5) Hull patches: 1 per displacement ton (located in easily accessable points
near the exterior hull throughout the vessel). Note, as with the Survival
kits, these items are alarmed (you want to know if the hulls been breached!).

6) Emergency beacon: 1 (located at an easily accessable central point).

7) Handheld illumination devices: 1 per 2 passengers or crew (located at
easily accessable points throughout the vessel).

8) Electronic tools: 1 set per driveroom (located in the driveroom).

9) Mechanical tools: 1 set per airlock (located in the airlock), 1 set per
dirveroom (located in the driveroom)

10) Metalworking tools: 1 set (located in the main driveroom). If the vessel
has more than 4 driverooms then there must be 1 set per driveroom (located in
the driveroom).

11) Atmosphere testers: 1 per airlock (located in the airlock).

12) Radiation counters: 1 per airlock (located in the airlock), 1 per
driveroom (located in the driveroom).

NOTES: Since most accidents requiring an "abandon ship" will happen within
100 planetary diameters (and there is virtually no chance of survival
regardless of equipment anywhere else) no vacc suits are provided for
passengers. Rescue balls are provided instead, unlike vacc suits these can be
used by anyone regardless of training (vacc suits require at least basic
familiarisation).

Also, these are minimum standards only. Other more stringent standards will
apply in some cases (specific types of vessels, vessels engaged in specific
activities, and vessels in specific regions). Also, prudent captians will
ensure that their vessels are better equiped.

Let\'s see more.

And more Traveller product - with ot without Foss (I say without)!

But most importantly - look at what Marc\'s done for us recently. He didn\'t

If this works out, perhaps it is a good thing. Depending, as you say, on the
reason for it. I make no bones about not liking what IG have done to Traveller.
I actually like the game system (and have no problem with the 1/2 dice at all)
and the rest (tho I prefer the modified Character Creation system I did for it
in Dark Star #1 ... naturally enough ... over theirs) ... and TLWH and Gateway
are reasonably good adventures. PE is a great idea ... though I have some
problems with aspects (as everyone else seems to as well).

However, I am disgusted at the incompetence of the people at IG. Starships, for
a start. FF&S2 typesetting. PE typesetting. Gateway layout and typesetting. They
have to be the most unprofessional "professional" company in the business! And
that\'s why I\'ll be buying GURPSTrav and not a single IG product in future
*unless* they (and this seems incredibly unlikely) get their act together.

Its got nothing to do with whether its difficult or not. What *is* important is
that the whole product shows a complete and total lack of competence of even the
most basic sort on the behalf of IG. Sorry, I won\'t buy ptoducts (knowingly)
with major typos in them.

Look, I bought printing #1 of Mtrav -- and I didn\'t bother to buy printing #2 or
the second edition or whatever. The complete cockup they made of what i had
meant that I was burnt enough, thank you very much. I never used the MTrav
system as a result ... I continued to use CTrav, but with the MTrav backghround.
I *could* have gone out and bought a "corrected" version of Mtrav, but why? I
had already spent A$60 or so to but the three garbage books I had, if GDW would
have swapped them for a complete reprinting with corrections for *free* I would
have swapped, but otherwise, no way ... I had better things to spend my 60 bucks
on thank you very much.

I have Milieu 0 and First Survey, to ... and I have no intention of buying the
hardback version, even if it does have extra materials, and for the same reason.
Basically, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me ... I bought
garbage once, and I have no intention of supporting the
incompetence/incompetents at IG by buying the supposedly new and improved
edition. Sure, if they want to do a swap and take my garbage copies and give me
a new hardcover for a nominal cost, say $10, then I would be interested ... but
no way will I actually buy the thing.

No, it won\'t be all things to all people ... and I agree that there are a lot of
problems with GURPS ... the character creation system is completely
unTravellerlike and will need to be changed dramatically if it is to be any good
(and if it isn\'t changed in GURPSTrav, then I will do an alternate system in
DS#3, just as I did for the T4 system in DS#1). However, it *will* sell ... and
Traveller needs a track record so that whoever has the license can see that it
*is* a goer, and that IG have to be ditched *completely* and replaced with
someone who is a) halfway competent and b) capable of producing a quality
product (i.e. with the financial backing to do so ... not an evidently
undercapitalised crock like IG).

Sure, there may not be more than one -- but you have GURPS Vehicles that is
vastly better (and simpler to use) than FF&S (#1 or #2); you have GURPS Robots
which does things that FF&S can\'t do; you have 3G3 which does things better than
FF&S2 for gun design ... and you\'ll soon have CORPS VDS for vehicles if you
don\'t really like GURPS Vehicles (and, while I like GV#1, I do not really like
GV#2); you have Ultra Tech and Ultra Tech #2 for all sorts of goodies ... most
of which can be easily integrated into GURPSTrav; you have GURPS Psionics ...
and there\'s much more. So you have all that good stuff to begin with as source
material for a huge potential variety of different campaign styles. And I
suspect that one of the things that GURPSTrav will (have to) do is to indicate
how to convert those source materials to Traveller compatability.

Look, I really like T4 as a *system* ... but its been too badly damaged by IG\'s
complete and total lack of competence. Short of a massive injection of competent
staff, funds to alleviate the time pressure caused by cash flow problems
(assuming that this *is* the reason for much of their lack of competently
produced products), and a vast increase in the quality of the products they are
doing, then I don\'t see that IG is *worth* saving. We would all be better off
with them going bust quickly, and with GURPSTrav being a large enough success to
attract someone with some *real* money and *real* competence to reissue a
cleaned up T4 as T5 ... someone, *anyone*, other than the displayed incompetents
at IG!

No, but if you have traffic regulations to keep ships from pulling up close,
your hypothetical pirate can\'t achieve surprise. It\'s not like he can lie
hidden in a dense patch of ether and pounce as the merchant passes him by.
Detection in space is an altogether different thing from detection on Earth
(and even here advanced technology is making things tougher and tougher on
the would-be lurker). In space there\'s no place to hide! (Hey, that would
make a good slogan for an Aliens rip-off ;-).

We have established no such thing. I don\'t even recall that you have claimed
it in this discussion, but I may just have missed it (In any case things
don\'t become established just because you (or, I admit it, I) claim it.) 
Have you ever played a TCS campaign? Did you put out scouts in every system 
you owned (and a lot you didn\'t)? Did you put pickets in all your systems? 
I did. And I _claim_ that anyone with a bit of sense would do the same. 
Those pickets might as well earn their keep by taking care of any passing 
pirates. 

Provided, of course, that there are enough assets to supply enough picket 
ships. About which, see below.

Do the math. The loss is negligible (The fuel cost is especially ludicrous). 
And it will be passed on to the customers anyway.

Why wouldn\'t trade want it? Piracy is bad. It\'s an unexpected expense that
can really mess up your financial statements. Getting rid of it is good for
everybody, and when an expense applies equally to everybody, as this one
will, no one can undercut their business rivals by avoiding the expense, so
no one will have an interest in getting rid of it. If anything, the big
companies might have the clout to get passed through faster than the small
fry, so it would actually be an advantage to them. The system could very
well exist even without the pirates.

So you have, but you haven\'t backed it up. I told you the rules I was 
basing my arguments on. If you think I\'m interpreting them wrong, show
me where I go wrong. If you think the rules are faulty (I\'ll certainly
admit that they are overly general) then tell me what rules you would
consider reasonable and show me how they make the navies of high-population 
worlds too weak to spare a few hundred patrol ships. But don\'t just say
that a single statement with no backup proves anything.

And that someone else can look out for pirates. \'In space there is no place
to hide!\' remember? How do you expect the pirate to get to the Gas Giant
undetected if the Gas Giant is under observation at all times?

>Also, the pirate doesn\'t need to be lurking in the exact spot.  

If he wants to remain hidden he has to lurk deep enough in the Gas Giant
that he can\'t be spotted by sensors. That puts him low enough to degrade 
his own sensors, interposes the planet between him and a lot of the area
that a refuelling ship may choose, and delay his flight if he does spot
an incoming ship.

>Just like any other system, he can spot you on the way in or out.

Oh, that\'s right. He won\'t be down there in the first place, because he
would have been spotted on the way in and patrol ships would be buzzing
him like angry bees. Look, anything that will help a pirate catch a
merchant will also help a patrol ship catch a pirate. The only thing that
will allow a pirate a fighting chance (as it were) is a dearth of patrol
ships.

OK, I\'ll concede that point. The mere _potential_ nastiness of a crime is 
evidently not enough to make governments react in a big way. Could it be
that it is the visibility of the crime that makes governments react more
to hijacking than to drug smuggling? Come to think of it, aren\'t the US
government putting a lot more effort into stopping drug smugglers than 
into stopping odd-bottle smugglers?

>If you want to suppose the Imperium has a similar view of piracy, 

I do want to. Piracy has all the earmarks of a crime that would provoke
governments in a big way.

>that is OK.  But that is simply a another spin on the problem, not 
>reasoning that invalidates an Imperium  with piracy.

Not on its own, agreed. But you will agree that the Emperor would rather
not have piracy, given a choice? That if he could simply push a button
and end piracy forever, he would do it? OK, so the problem simply boils
down to a comparison of two things: 1) How much effort would it take to
suppress piracy and 2) how badly do you want it.

I maintain that using 1/1000th of your naval budget to suppress piracy
sounds worth it to avoid having to soothe angry delegations of merchants
who wants Something Done About This Outrage.

And I\'ve pointed out that you would have those dozens. And scores.

True, provided the system has other worlds that are being exploited. Of
course, if they are being exploited they represent the interests of a
sizable civilization with Stellar+ technology. Someone with a sizable
naval budget...

>Then you need to do this in every system in the Imperium.  

And a lot of those systems will only need to have one world patrolled.

Remember that the communication lag applies equally to the pirates. If you 
have a few cruisers visiting the pickets on a random basis, the pirates
(the hypothetical band of pirates who won\'t exist if single pirates can\'t
make a living) won\'t know if they are commiting suicide when they try to
jump in and surprise the patrol. And, again, a pirate don\'t like fighting
navy ships; there\'s no future in it. Btw., you can keep a cruiser
permanently with quite a few of the patrols and still keep within the
budget I postulate.

So you have, and I still find your reasoning flawed. If you want to agree
to disagree, then that\'s fine by me. If you want to argue, then that\'s
fine too, but then you have to expect me to argue back, right?

design system; TSCS is the space combat system.

	The Traveller Naval Architecture System (TNAS) provides the ability to
design spacecraft, starships and small craft for Traveller quickly (a typical
design takes less than 30 minutes) and easily. The system is based on
standardized components which are selected from lists. 
	TNAS designs craft of 10 tons or more, and ships up to 10,000 tons. It does
not allow for customized ship components. Ships designed using TNAS resolve
combat using the Traveller Ship Combat System (TSCS).

TNAS includes 
1. Introduction.
2. QSP (Quick Ship Profile) for a basic UPP-sized description of ships.
3. Starship Card (as opposed to just a format) on which the data is recorded
(and used in TSCS).
4. Checklist/Worksheet for the design process.
5. Standard components based on FF&S2. But shown as lists.

TSCS includes
1. Introduction.
2. Search Procedure
3. Space Combat Procedure.


In a message dated 97-09-26 07:50:12 EDT, you write:

<< I did notice that the proportions he gave for the wedge hull were 1:1

Is there some requirement that all hulls of a form must be in specific

<Snip of campaign details>

Christopher, I\'ve used something like this. One possible suggestion, rather than
have your rock (mine was the last gasp of a star wars defense system) damage the
J-drive directly, destroy the power plant. This will render the ship dead in the
water just as effectively, without the need for as much collateral damage, making
it a bit more realistic that the PCs can repair it with out a full shipyard at
their disposal.

Transportation is the key. I placed the 2nd Imperium star port, (source in my game
for the repair parts) half a world away and behind enemy lines, (two tech 5
nations at war, the PC\'s ship landed in one, the parts were in another, being used
by a techno-preisthood, who DID NOT want to give them up!). If you destroy their
shuttle, they will have to repair it to get the repair parts into space, or create
a surface to orbit technology, not impossible, especially if they only need to use
it once, rather than multiple times, which the amount of damage you ar proposing
would call for. Or, you could provide a shuttle in wrecked colony ship, but why
wouldn\'t the locals have used it before losing their tech?

Depending on how creative your group is (mine were very) don\'t give them too much.
This scenario lasted several games, my players had to first make friendly contact,
find that there were replacement parts, locate them, organize a raiding party
around local fighters and transportation, perform the raid, transport the power
plant across hostile territory, and then engineer modifications to their ship to
use it. During the course of all this they managed to up grade the tech level of
their allies in some areas by several points (the world was about tech 5, by the
time they were done there was tech 6-7 weapons on the drawing boards of their
allies).

Should be fun. Please, let me know how the campaign goes, on the TML if others are
interested, or by private email.

Which is, when it really comes down to it, what roleplaying is all about.  I
bought the T4 rules only a short while ago (I was gearing up my campaign
using TNE rules mixed with a little MT.  I was seriously considering the MT
task system).  I would have bought them sooner, but the only people who were
speaking up on the list were so damn negative about it.  I really thought if
I bought it I\'d want to take it back spitting...

But I didn\'t, and I liked it.

But enough about that...  Where does one get a copy of the KBv2.0 rules
stuff?

Agreed, unless he had the option of going to another jurisdiction. One that

Yes, but he still has to pay his bills. The operation has to keep in the
black. That is one of the fundamental differences between the public and
the private warship.

Ah, no... Black operations may be winked at, but they would still be
illegal. There\'s no such thing as a Letter of Marque unless you are 
actually at war.

Agreed so far.

Not at all. They can be sent from the neighboring system. All maintenance
and repair can be performed at the home port. That\'s how the US keeps
ships in the oceans of the world that dosen\'t adjoin her.

And the average answer is roughly 5 trillion credit squadrons per billion 
people living in the sector. That\'s what I\'ve been trying to get across.

All navies I\'ve heard of have had ships of various sizes for various jobs.
Ships of customs and anti-piracy work size are also ideal for pickets. 

>Larger ships, while fitting into the mission of the Imperial Navy, tend to 
>be impractical for serious piracy suppression.  (I\'d run, wouldn\'t you?)

I\'d run from a patrol ship too. And that\'s all you need to suppress piracy.
A pirate has to pay his bills. If he has to run he can\'t capture, if he
can\'t capture he can\'t gain loot, and if he can\'t loot he has to go
bankrupt or turn to honest work.

>Resoure allocation will be a concern - no matter which era your campaign

Come on, you can\'t be serious. You couldn\'t run an interstellar civilization
if there really were a 1 in 36 chance of a misjump every time.

>How much of your resources are you going to throw at it?  Every ship that a 
>Class C, D, or E system has to buy is credit that flows _out_ of the system. 

Every ship a class A or B system build is a loss of resources too. The two
situations are very alike, except that the loss is slightly bigger for the
C, D, and E systems, but not that much bigger. If you want to be able to
defend your system, you need either ships or a friendly ally with ships.
In any case, once you have the ships, you may as well get some use out of
them. 

>Every person that mans and/or maintains the ships are skill sets that are 
>not being used to generate credit either in the industrial base, 

And so is every person that mans and/or maintains the ships of the class A
and B systems. 

>or through taxation/duties or whatever. 

Once they have the ships classe C, D, and E systems can collect taxes and
duties as much as any class A and B system. (In any case, customs and
taxation dosen\'t create wealth, it merely moves it around).

>(tho\' some would argue that protecting the merchants encourages growth,

Neither is the \'gain\' you get from having a navy to protect you from losses
you won\'t suffer because you have the navy.

Yes, and there is no reason why patrol ships can\'t keep a system like that
free of pirates. \'In space there is no place to hide!\' (Which is not
entirely true... the correct expression is \'In space there is no place to
hide except a hell of a long way away from sensors and with your engines
turned waaaay down!\', but it dosen\'t have the same snap ;-)

I\'m not saying you can\'t hide in space, but I do say that you can\'t hide
close to a traffic lane. Remember, all merchants are required to use
transponders. That means there is no reason why they shouldn\'t use
active sensors (especially so for those on regular scheduled flights).

All it takes to keep a star system free of pirates is enough ships to do
it. So the question remains: Will there be enough ships to do it? And my
answer is: Definitely yes.

>And, as I have pointed out in other posts, intra-system traffic is an

BTW. have you considered that a lot of intra-system traffic will be
conducted by jump ships?

With all due respect, you\'re singing a different tune now.  You said that
FFS2 was unusable due to the skewed equations.  So, yes, it does have to do
with whether it is difficult or not.

On the other hand, I agree.  Yes, when all is said and done, IG should have
checked their proofs.  Its a shame that they let a couple of rookie mistakes
hamstring a potentially brilliant product.

However, it also seems that some of your problem might come from the fact
that you really don\'t like FFS to begin with.  Which is fine, people are
entitled to their own opinions...

I\'m sure you\'ve seen by now that Marc Miller has said he wouldn\'t mind
putting the extra info on the list for everybody who bought the first two
books.  However, what do you find wrong with Milieu: 0, exactly?  If its
garbage, why is it garbage?

Again, I have the book, and I have been using it just fine.  I have run into
no problems at all with it.

Yes it will sell.  Although I\'m not sure that this is the magic wand waving
over everything that it may seem to be.  I don\'t know, I voiced this before,
and I got some semi-hostile responses, but GURPS doesn\'t seem to be a hot
seller in my neck of the woods.  I know of only own store that has a fairly
wide selection of GURPS stuff at the moment, and it doesn\'t seem to fly off
the shelf like everyone seems to think.  I haven\'t asked about the sales, but
the same sourcebooks are there day in and day out.

But, that could just be the area I live in.

Be fair here.  3G3 is 1.) not an official GURPS product and 2.) works just as
well with T4 as it works with GURPS.  The CORPS VDS will probably also have
its own conversions for T4 it seems.  So, I think its unfair to lump these in
the GURPS and GURPS alone category.  I like 3G3 very much.  I think its a
good book.  I also like FFS2.  To be completely honest, I\'ve been having more
trouble pushing out gun designs with 3G3, but I think this is mainly because
I\'m more used to FFS gun smithing.

As far as the GURPS technological supplements, I really haven\'t had the
chance to peruse them, with the exception of Robots.  I wasn\'t extremely
impressed with it.  I can\'t tell you why exactly, I just didn\'t come away
feeling that this was the be all and end all of robot creation books.
 Although, I think it would be unfair to make a major judgement based on
having perused the book a couple of times in the comic book store.

Well, T4 as a system hasn\'t been damaged too much.  Some of the supplements
are flawed.  Some ("Starships") more flawed than others, and some ("Emperor\'s
Arsenal", "Central Supply Catalog") damn good product.  All in all, T4 has
had a _really_ rocky start.  I don\'t believe in following anything blindly,
and I\'ve tried to get as much info on a specific book as possible before
buying it.  Luckily my local gaming store has no problem with you checking
out the books before you buy them.  The only book I was there to buy when it
came in was FFS2 and I\'m quite happy with my purchase.  I avoided "Starships"
in a big way mainly because I looked through it and was very unhappy.  I\'m
still not sold on "Aliens Archive", so I haven\'t bought it yet.  The store
hasn\'t managed to keep a copy of "Pocket Empires" in long enough for me to
get a copy or even check it out at length, same with "Psionic Institutes".
 They also haven\'t been able to keep a copy of FFS2 on the shelves either.

But when it comes down to it, its a matter of taste.  I agree that IG has
fumbled the ball very often.  However, I think when you step back and take a
look at the whole line, its really less flawed then it appears.

Most everyone fingered Redman as the culprit which was correct, but Eric
Nolan was the first to guess the closest.

Eric writes 9/25/97:

Bulls eye. Granted one small ship is small fry for the Imperium of the
1100\'s, but Redman is also a fairly insignificant field operative. When the
PC\'s ship (a unique and unknown design, remember?) landed on this backwater
world, warning messages went off at local intelligence H.Q. Redman
volunteered as a means the improve her own career.

At this point the group would have several options:
1) Do nothing. At least, do nothing subversive to the Imperium. Redman will
eventually decide the PCs are loyal to the Imperium and leave. This could
actually be a good thing, since a favorable report could lead to some
lucrative contracts with ImpInt or related factors.

2) Eliminate Redman. This option is not as easy as it may seem. Redman is a
highly intelligent, well trained (but not overly experienced), cold-blooded
killer. The first thing she will attempt is sabotage of the vessels
powerplant with a \'dead-man\' switch. A viral program inserted in the power
management computer subsystems will monitor for Redman\'s active input.
Should she ever meet an untimely end the powerplant will immediately shut
down, which could have disastrous effects if the ship should be in jump.
Redman never intended it to be used, but instead needed a bargaining chip
to affect her escape should she ever get cornered by the crew.

3) Fall into Redman\'s trap. Should the players be disloyal to the Imperium
then then ImpInt or the navy will act accordingly.

4) Not let Redman on board. This one could be the most sadistic. Should the
crew lock their doors against Redman she will simply disappear, but shortly
local authorities will come knocking will lots of BIG guns. The PCs will
become suspects themselves in the murder of three people and since they
were present in the \'flea-bag hotel\' physical evidence will be available to
press charges. Meanwhile any evidence of Redman\'s involvement or even her
existence on planet will evaporate. The players are unlikely to be found
guilty (with a really good defence lawyer), but the time involved will be
more than long enough for Imperial authorities to seize the ship and
uncover it\'s secrets by brute force.

Extrapolating from a \'stony body\' planetoid hull, with a tougness of 0.71,

Other problems would include river bottoms made up of soft mud that could
suck a BD-equipped trooper down, strong currents, and damage to equipment.

Given a choice, I\'d rather take a crossing point like a bridge or ford than
waste time walking across the bottom.

My NSLBVFGS does a regular business with T4.  Not their hottest seller, but

I don\'t do mail-order because I want to support the store.. I like having a
place to hang out and discuss RPGs with some friends.

Excellent, actually.. I\'m always after my players to pick up rule books.

That is wonderful news!

I would love to have Tim Brown or Courtney discuss several things with us
about IG\'s business end.. 

They need to slow down.  Get T4.1 done *correctly* (as bug-free as humanly
possible) and then start giving writers time to properly playtest their
submissions.  Setting up a secure playtest system would be helpful.

I must admit, the Foss art has grown on me.. like mold.  But if it keeps
the look of Traveller consistant, I\'m all for it.

Marc has long struck me as one of the cooler designers in the industry.  I

my questions, even the dim ones.  :)

We snipe, because we all love the game, but we all love it for slightly
different reasons.  The differences are what makes the list interesting,
IMHO.  I remember X-Boat, which had all the vibrancy of a rest home at
times, with people not really saying much beyond "we\'re the only REAL
Traveller, daggummit!"

Gamescape (Palo Alto, Ca) which is right next to Stanford University, keeps
a good amount of T4 in stock and gave M:0 Campaign a prominent place on the
new arrivals shelf.  They sold out of FFS2 in two days, and have made T4 a
regular part of the order.

Unless you have hard evidence that IG is in trouble, please don\'t start.
As for Starships.. it was released a year ago!  Get over Starships!  The
people who were responsible for that abortion of a supplement are gone, and
since then we\'ve seen some marked improvement in the line.

People said much the same thing when White Wolf licensed the World of

I wish somebody would explain to me why I\'m able to use FFS2 when it is
unusable.  Must be my complete inability to do higher math has blinded me
to the "fact" that rather than designing starships I should be pouting over
the futzed equations.

Nope, a yard is the length of the _kings_ outstretched arm, just as an
inch is the length of the first joint of the _kings_ thumb. A cubit is the
distance of _Noah\'s_ elbow to his fingertips.

On the other hand, so to speak, knowing the dimensions of various parts of
your body makes for very handy, built in rulers. If I stretch out my left
hand as far as I can, it measures 8 1/2 inches from tip of my little
finger to the tip of my thumb; my right hand is a half-inch longer. Good
enough for approximate rule-of-thumb measurements in the hardware store
when, as usual, the tape measure is buried somewhere in the mess at home.

It\'s excellent.  But I\'d recomend picking up the latest version (3G3) which
has conversions for MT, TNE and T4.

Pfui.  This morning, while running *errands* to gameshops (a day off from
work is a good thing...) I asked each shopkeeper about T4 sales.  The three
shops I visited didn\'t claim GREAT sales, but all said that a) they stock
all new T4 items because they DO sell, b) their response as to game quality
is average - that is, T4 doesn\'t seem to be the game to beat, but it DOES
sell consistently (not only on initial order, but on restocks as well), and
c) after being asked specifically about gear-head topics (i.e., those you\'d
only address after reading FF&S2 from cover to cover), they said they heard
nothing in the way of complaints (or comments or anything else...) - out of
the ordinary - about them. Apparently, The Deadlands recently caused quite
a stir in a good way, while a couple of others garnered bad feedback.
Conclusion:  From the viewpoints of at least three sellers, T4 is a solid,
middle of the road game system. 

It occured to me that my perspective may be a bit warped.  I read dozens of
msgs per day from what must be the Traveller Elite (sorry folks - that\'s
what you are).  I assume that OF COURSE if there\'s a flaw in the vehicle
generation charts of The Emporer\'s Motorcycles, every gamer will notice it.
This doesn\'t seem to be the case.  Almost every TMLer will notice it.  Most
*normal* gamers seem to use a supplement to pull equipment from for a game.
 Most (in my limited experience) don\'t study the stats to verify them.  Net
result is that much of what I hear is broken/misguided/miscalculated about
T4 on the TML is only important to a limited number of us (Oops - I mean
you).  Most people - IMLE - take the canned vehicles/equipment and run...

This is basically the _fixed_ version of QSDS (still my favorite starship
design system) fixed to be compatible with FFS2 instead of FFS. As Derek
or Dave (Sorry, I don\'t remember who it was) said recently, they\'re
waiting on an official go-ahead for that...just Pu-leeze!!! Give us more
than a week to pound it out! As this is more of a port than a new product,
and the actual authors of FFS2 would be involved, a very usable,
relatively bug-free system could be put together pretty quickly. After all
QSDS _has_ seen considerable playtesting...look at how many THUDDD and
miscellaneous posted designs have been done using it. But I really don\'t
want to see QSDS2 published, then within three months be up to QSDS2.2.3.

If we can be _really_ ambitious, also include an appendix on making a
standard item list using FFS2, that way new component lists could be
readily generated.

Absolutely none, but it _must_ be specified in the design sequence to
ensure backwards compatibility with FFS2. Finally we\'ll get to
do it _right_! 

Ahhh...the grail of compatible simple/complex sytems seems to be shining
in yonder tower! But Hark!! What is that _spanking_ sound I hear? ;-)

There is no arguing with you on this one, Phil.  IG definitely has its
problems in this area.

You\'d think they\'d learn after those Judges-Guild-rip-off-deck-plans in
Starships.

And, I admit, it is taking them some time to learn the lesson.

My hope is that IG will get its act together.

I remember the first time I opened an AD&D supplement (I was a very avid
player of that game, but I haven\'t played in about 5 years--having
completed a 5 year campaign) and saw the whole document looking like
parchment paper.

There were neat drawings that took your imagination away, the cover
related to the contents, and the whole thing just spoke of atmosphere
and quality.

I\'ve never had a problem with D&D\'s quality.  They\'ve had their flops,
sure, but they were few and far between, at least in my opinion.

I\'d like to see IG\'s supplements reach this level.  They are not there
yet, but I do see them trying.

After you get past all of that outer, marketing stuff, the quality of IG
stuff is pretty good.  I just finished reading Psionics Institutes, and
I\'m going to have no problem converting some of the things in that book
to my 1100\'s campaign.

The point is the MATERIAL in IG products is pretty good.  They just need
to focus on making their stuff look better, especially after you open
the cover, and focus on the typos and printing errors.

Sombody said that on the IG products page, there is a reference to the
Varge.  Whoever wrote that should be shot.  Whoever is in charge of the
website should be shot.  This is the type of thing that is hurting their
reputation.

They\'ve got a great role model in which to base IG product--old DGP
material.  They should use it.  

DGP stuff wasn\'t that fancy, but even compared to IG\'s stuff today, DGP
stuff LOOKS like it blows it away.  Those old DGP things always had
neat, very Traverllish art, very few typos, nice deckplans and system
maps, and incredible sector and subsector maps.

I\'d like to see IG get to this quality.

I\'m sticking in there.  I believe they will.

Kenneth.

Phil,

I do understand your reasons.  IG has made some mistakes, and some say,
"continue to make."

But, there\'s one thing for you to consider.  Marc is taking care of
those people, like me and you, who bought First Survey and Milieu 0
first editions.

He\'s going to make the added information available ON THIS LIST!

C\'mon.  You\'ve got to give him credit for that.  It\'s an incredible
move--one that you wouldn\'t expect from a game company.  

Doesn\'t Marc and IG deserve some slack for this?

I\'m not saying to give them any slack just because.  I\'m saying I think
Marc & Co. has EARNED some slack because of this.

It looks to me like they are trying.

Quick question:  Will there ever be a design system in which we can

Or is FF&S2 the place to do that?

I\'ll send you a copy of the long form with all the whys and why-fors 
in it.  This will include details on specific issues, like how to 
use the mutiple action rule, Spectacular Success and Spectacular 
Failure based on a character\'s skill level (the more skilled he his, 
the better chance of SS and the worse chance of SF), and  other 
things like JOT.

I\'m sending this in a word.doc.  If you have a problem reading that, 
let me know.  I\'ve got it in regular e-mail format too.



There are two basic changes that need to be made to use KBv2.0.

1)  Change the number of dice used to these whole dice codes.

Easy   2D
Average   3D
Difficult   4D
Formidable   5D
Staggering  6D
Impossible   7D



2)  Change the way you calculate the target number
 (In T4, target number = stat + skill)

KBv2.0 Target Number = Stat + Experience

      where:    Experience = Skill x 3



All the details are in the long post.  It\'s on the way.

Right, and an inch is the length of the first joint of your thumb, or it\'s
width (or in my case the length of the first joint of my index finger..I
have small hands ;-).  A mile is so many strides (2000, I think). An ounce
is one (or two can\'t remember) mouthful of water and all weights and fluid
measures are multiples of that, in one way or another.  Hands (4 inches)
were the width of an open hand, including thumb.  Feet were..you guessed
it..approximately the length of one foot. I think Stadia were a certain
number of strides by Roman troops marching in formation on a road, and a
Stadium was a track of one stadia..right?

The old system is, at its heart, a series of approximations that match up
with things about the human body.  Shipwrecked sailors, engineers without
tools, stranded Legionnaires in the wilds of Germany could construct
measuring sticks and containers that would be "close enough" for TL0-3
work.  Metric is scientific, but much harder to estimate in  humanistic
terms.  The other advantage of the Imperial system is that it is very easy
to divide into different sized sections, yes I know metric is easy..just
divide by ten..but most Imperial units are
multiples/divisions of 2 or 4 of smaller/larger units.

For exacting work, metric makes sense, but the old imperial system is an
absolutely ingenious invention.

In T4, damage done by a person\'s body (hands, feet, etc.) do 1D 
damage, right?

Well, skipping through the EA, I see that in the description of this 
high tech knife (TL 10, I think) it states that knives will never be 
more than 1D.

Then I go to the low tech weapons, and I notice that swords are 
either 1D or 2D.  The same thing goes for clubs 2D).

So, my question is, why use a knife or a low tech sword when you can 
do the same damage with your fist?

Also, why is it that a knife does the same damage as a fist anyway?  
It seems that, with a knife, you can do a lot more damage, quicker, 
than you can with your bare fists.

In MT, this was a little different, in that fists did 1D damage, 
knives and such did 2D, and swords did 3D.


Ken\'s quick fix tweak to this:

Just looking at this briefly, I\'d say reduce your hand damage to 1/2 
die (1 to 3), leaving room for the extra damage done by knives, and 
swords.

This way, fists do .5D, knives and daggers do 1D, and swords do 2D.

Marc,

I do hope this post calms some of the latest batch of doomsayers. Just a comment to the
above piece of your post. To be honest the Length component of the SSDS system is one
of the things that really annoys me. While I\'ve been working on a Excel spread sheet
using the FFS2 formula I found that it has been carried to describing the dimensions of
the hull, dependent on shape. For a system that is supposed to be the ground work for
designing other systems I find the fixed dimensions, again, annoying. This is the type
of limitation that should have been left for derivative, component based systems, not
imposed in the grass-roots design system. While I am including them in the spread sheet
I\'m working on I fully intend to ignore them when working with deck plans, making the
plans fit my own view.Hieght:Width:Length aren\'t fixed in the real world, why should
they be in Traveller, except as determined by mission etc.

I don\'t mean this as a flame or attack on the writers of FFS2. I fully appreciate the
effort they put into the book, and, overall, I like it very much. I just wanted to
voice my opinion that it still has a bit of a derived feel to it. I wonder where they
came up with those modifiers?

fact, the noble is the Marquis in charge of the subsector...)

And then there\'s the Tukera-Oberlindes war -- a big corporation
and a megacorporation going up against each other.  And we all
know that the megacorps are virtually laws unto themselves.


IOW, piracy as "Joe Shmoe gets a ship and uses it" probably
isn\'t going to happen, much, for reasons already stated in the
various pirate threads.

But the Imperium _does_ allow a certain low level of military
actions among its components (so long as the general peace
isn\'t threatened or a world endangered), and it seems as if
there\'s a window in here for piratical actions, as military
ops against another world/company/entity.


How prevalent is this sort of thing? Ideas?  Comments?

	Marc, this sounds really good, but I guess my question is why? Such a
system already exists, called QSDS. It is a well-designed system that needs
only revision to make it compatible with FF&S2. Guy Garnett did excellent
work on this, and I\'m sure, as he stated here, he would be more than
willing to assist you in updating it. I really like QSDS (more than FF&S2,
to be honest) and would like to see it remain.

HOPEFULLY without the rules about screening ships in a three-dimensional
volume of ships many thousands of kilometers across....I\'m sorry, but that
just sticks in my craw :) (if it\'s a good system, I\'m sure I can ignore
that part if it\'s in there, but the idea of "battle lines" in space just
bugs me......)

Well, not really, other than compatibility with already published sources.
This is not a change that would bother me that much, as long as perhaps
suggestions were imparted as how to create different ratios if desired.

	There\'s nothing that says a ship _has_ to be a certain proportion BUT the
ratios do matter in the hull design. The dimension ratios _do_ change the
surface area and therefore the mass/volume taken up by the shell. A long
skinny cylinder will have less volume available for components than a
short, stout one of the same overall volume. For example, for a 10,000Td
cylinder with 10cm of armor (fairly thin), the short, stout cylinder (1:1)
loses 20Td to armor. On the other hand, a longer cylinder (3.5:1) loses
26Td to armor. Those six displacement tons certainly would affect the
design--that\'s a fairly decent size turret, or 3 small staterooms, or six
tons of cargo, etc. On the other hand, the longer cylinder has more surface
area for weapons, sensors, etc.

	BTW, I don\'t know where the FF&S2 wedge proportions came from ... that was
something that didn\'t get done! I\'ll come up with the equations and post
them this week.

	For those who are interested in differently-proportioned configurations
from those in FF&S2, I\'ve posted the way I came up with the surface and
dimension factors at 

	www.pcisys.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/Shipyard/FFSNotes/FFS2Notes.html

	That page also links to an Excel spreadsheet that lets you simply plug in
the proportions you want for any of the standard shapes and pop out the
exact modifiers. So if you want a cylinder that\'s 10 times as long as it is
wide (the longest right now is 3.5:1), go right ahead!

Good game stores do not order products on the basis of how good they
 are, they order products based on how many they expect to _sell_.  The
actual quality of a game line matters only to the extent that it affects
sales.

For example at the game stores I order games for I order a lot of Rifts
products not because I think Rifts is good but because I expect to sell
a lot of copies.  I order few copies of T4 materials because I expect to
sell few copies of T4 materials, this is based on sales for previous
Traveller 4 products.  If T4.1 is sufficiently better than T4 that I
will be able to truthfully reccommend it to people, we will sell out of
it faster, reorder more, and increase our orders for future products.

I will order a few more copies of GURPS Traveller than I have been
ordering for T4 or for Gurps products because I like the Gurps rules and
the Traveller setting.  Therefore I will like Gurps Traveller.  If I
like it I can sell more of it.  The fact that SJG has shown better
standards for editing their products will also help this product.

Game stores, or at least good ones, should [IMNSHO] try to meet the
needs and wants of their customers, not sell what they think is "good".

One of the paradigms of todays market (as I see it and as I have heard
mentioned by people in the industry) is that you only need to sell a few
thousand copies of your games in order to make some money at it.  The
writers may not be well paid, but if a game company - at least one
without excessive overhead, can sell a few thousand copies of a game the
publisher can make a (slight) profit and move on to the next product for
the line.

Sweetpea Entertainment is a movie company.  Movie companies need good
ideas for story concepts.  Travellers Third Imperium storyline _is_ a
good idea.  If Imperium Games needs to spend a small (by Hollywood
standards) ammount of money on the game to keep the flow of good ideas
going they will do so.  How long they can do so will depend on the size
of Courtney Solomans pockets (none of our business) and whether or not
the Traveller line has a slight negative cash flow or a slight positive
cash flow.

It is not just in Traveller the game that everything boils down to
economics.  Everything boils down to economics.

Those darn conservative Vilani architects strike again !

I suspect that the best design for a grav tank might resemble a somewhat
flattened (ie airframe hull) sphere.  The sphere will have less surface
area (which needs to be armored) for the size of its internal voulume. 
Grav Tanks with adequate power plants can make a pretty fair speed and
would be helped by airframe hulls.

This does start to bring up the question of where a grav tank ends and
where a heavy atmospheric fighter begins.

Man!  I interpreted the Quick Kill rule differently from both of you. The
way I read it (and run it) is if the D20 is <= the *rolled* damage value of
the shot you get instant death (actually, instant
incapacitation and/or unconsciousness the way I play it).  I only used this
on edged and fired weapons.

This means that if you hit somebody in the head or chest with that gauss
rifle (4d6) and roll 14, the GM rolls a 1d20 and you get a "quick kill" on
a roll of *14* or less on that d20 (odds on a 4d weapon would range from
20% to 95% for instant kill).  Even a 1d6 Pop Gun to the chest has a
significant chance to instantly take the target down (5% to 30%). This
makes combat *very* deadly, and PC\'s are well advised to avoid it at *all*
costs.

Actually, I play it that "quick kill" translates to *automatic*
unconsciousness on a head shot and incapacitation, with a Difficult Task
(against CON) to remain conscious on chest shots.  Either leads to death
within CON+2d6 minutes unless medical care can stabilize the damage, a
Difficult or Formidable Task depending on the severity of the wound (GM
option).  This was my way of making the combat a little *less* deadly. I
never had a problem with TNE combat not being deadly enough. ;->

I agree with you.  They are called *deadly* weapons for a good reason and
if the PC\'s get in their way too often...you get dead *very* fast. Doesn\'t
mean there won\'t be any combat, just that it better be *important* before
you pull out the gauss weapons, and you better remember the body armor,
helmet, and to get behind cover fast.

I\'m using a modified T4 task system, but a lot of the rest of what I\'m
using is my interpretations of CT/MT/TNE..with additional hunks from FGU\'s
Aftermath, FUDGE, GURPS, and others.  

As an aside for my PBEM player\'s...I still use the "quick kill" rules so be
careful with those guns.

As it has been said over and over.. gearheading is one possible part of
Traveller, not a mandatory part of the game.  Me, I like sweating out the
details of the ship, gun, planet I\'m designing, and I find it to be a good
way to keep my game up between campigns.  If you don\'t enjoy designing
things, well, there are now three T4 books out that are nothing but
equipment lists.  Or, for those of us on the list, ask the gearheads to
design something for you.

I\'m currently doing some design work for an upcoming supplement.  I know
that 95% of the readers will either have no use for the ships I\'m building
or never bother to reverse engineer what I\'ve done.  Fine, but it\'s for the
other 5% and my own sense of correctness that I\'m sweating the numbers out.

That is why grav belts are a better solution.  Given the fact that grav
belts (at a little over Cr 100,000) each are cheaper than Battle Dress
and add significantly to its operational flexability implies that Battle
Dress troops should usually have grav belts as well.

Battledress\'s strength augmentation, increased mass, and sensors should
make it easier to cross river bottoms in most cases.  The strength
augmentation and increased mass will make it harder for the current to
affect the wearer.  Battledress will also ensure that the occupent is
much less fatigued, since he will not be using his own strength to
cross. If the river bottom is muddy the increased weight may make it
somewhat harder to cross as the troop sinks in somewhat, however the
Battledress\'s sensors may reveal the mud & then a trained user should
know to go around the mud.

I would like to see the design compacter modelled
What is the design compacter, Bob?

Well Howard, the design compacter is the cycle you have to go through 
once you have finished your vehicle design and you are evaluating through 
the stats for exact power to weight, top speed, armour rating etc. You 
find that if you just lose that little bit of cargo space that nobody 
will miss then the armour associated with it can also go which frees a 
bit of weight to allow the speed/accel/cruise into the next bracket.  
Then you find that the volume the armour took up is now surplus so that 
can go. Which frees some more armour. Which makes more power plant 
surplus. Removing that frees more space and so on.....   

Of course the amounts get smaller for each round of the cycle.  What I 
want to know is what is the limit so that I dont have to go round the 
cycle each time.  If I call the amount of slack at first 100 when I have 
got rid of the slack how much less will there be 115? 120? 150?

Well thanks for that explanation Bob and now the weather...

But in real life (TM) a good martial artist can usually disable or kill
their opponent with 1 or (at most) 2 good blows if that is their
objective.  Maybe fist fights _should_ be short & bloody.  If you
disagree or are modeling a different paradigm that is also a perfectly
valid perspective, but is perhaps not as "realistic".

_Very_  nicely said, Harold.  This is one of the things I like about
Traveller.

As the former player of an former Scout engineer charecter who (in MT)
interrupted a bank robbery by about 8 people with shotguns by throwing
her Frisbee at one of them I would like to strongly protest the notion
that the engineer is always stuck keeping the engine running.  (The ref
decided that base dammage for my sharp edged frisbee was 0.5 dammage
point.  My roll was 8 points over the to hit value, so she did 8x
dammage.  The 4d dammage killed the bank robber.)  She took out 1 or 2
more by using her Telekinesis to rip the shotgun out of one of the
robbers hands & shooting him with it.  Fortunately the robbers had
already destroyed the cameras, the hostages were face down & did not see
this & the few bank robbers who might have ratted her out as psionic
ended up witha bad case of dead or she might have been in trouble. (CT
setting in 1083) and her distraction allowed the 2 party members caught
in the bank (including the Str D Vargr Imperial Marine w/ Infighting) to
take out some of the other bank robbers.  I\'ll admit that it was
incredibly stupid and that she was lucky to survive the 12 dice she took
from the aimed point blank shotgun blast (she had just come from the
nearby beach & a bathing suit did not provide much armor protection...)
in round 4 but it was in charecter.

IMNSHO you just need a more warped player playing the engineer :)

But pirates are more likely to attack smaller ships.  Smaller ships are,
ceteris parabus, weaker & less able to defend themselves.  (they are
also less valuable but pirates are not interested in fair fights they
are interested in easy money)  Therefore pirates will attck smaller
ships more.  MegaCorporations have big (or very big ) ships in most
cases (economies of scale & all that).  THerefore pirates hurt small
merchants the most.

Maybe this is why pirates still exist in Traveller.  The MegaCorps have
pressured the Imperial government away from dealing with pirates so the
pirates will weaken the competative ability of the smaller companies.

When the Corps lobby the Imperial government they are using the line
that the navy needs big ships to fight off the Zhos & these ships need
to be concentrated rather then spread out (to avoid defeat in detail). 
Coincidently this will mean fewer ships to stop pirates. They might even
argue that the Imperial Navy should concentrate on the job of preparing
to fight enemy states & let the sector & subsector fleets take care of
the pirates.  Then the MegaCorps go to the Sector & subsector
governmnets & pressure them not to patrol very much either.  The actual
members of the Navy are presumably as anti pirate as anyone else & may
deter some piracy by shooting pirates ships who won\'t stand too for a
customs inspection.  (the old "shot while resisting arrest" bit so
popular with certani police forces....)

The big corporations can then use the (too slight to involve the
government but scary to individuals) threat of pirates to encourage
passengers to take their ships rather than tramp starships.  Since their
ships will be bigger and (possibly) more comfortable anyway most
passengers won\'t take much convincing.  A line in thier ships brochures
or ads saying something like "travel in comfort & safety" would probably
do it.

This may be why their are pirates in Traveller - The MegaCorps hinder
the effort to stop them for their own reasons.  As long as the pirates
do not kill or rob very many nobles they may continue to get away with
their nefarious trade.

I\'ve always thought that one of the reasons a ship might be hijacked while

If the piracy actions are but a single facet of an overall terrorist

I\'ll not argue the point about the Letter of Marque, because technically
you are correct.  I was just trying to make the point about a
quasi-legitimacy given to a corporate raider or a planetary operative.
(Not very well made, tho\'!  :)

However, corporate/planetary support would give a corsair a number of
advantages

- - a base to operate from/return to
- - a form of legitimacy (until caught anyway...)
- - a source of trusted, trained personnel to draw from

In some ways, I would prefer raiders that need to draw their operating
funds from the merchants they prey on.  Corporate/Planetary support means
they don\'t have to worry about the damage they cause...

(Since I\'ve hand my hand slapped a few times for going on about the U.S.
military, I\'ll avoid the subject... ;)

By definition, Class A build Jump-capable ships, Class B build non-Jump
capable.  Annual maintenance of starships must be performed at Class A or
B starports.  (I have my own beliefs about this, but they are best
discussed in a \'starport\' thread...anyone want to start one?)

So, for pure system defense, a SDB must be built at a Class A or B
starport, then ferried to the Class C,D or E system it will be based in.
Once there, it must be ferried _back_ to the Class A or B starport
(probably the same one it was built at) for maintenance.  (How often does
a _non-jump_ spacecraft need maintenance?  Annually?  Every 5 years?  My
campaign house rules allow for non-jump ships to be serviced by tenders,
and only need starport facilities for repair.)

Generally the smaller ships do it.  (FF,DD and CGs) In the Traveller

Actually, no.  I play \'house rules\' for jump.  I try and debate with the

With the Class \'A\' and \'B\' ports, the sale of the ship will result in the
influx of credit.  That credit will support the infrastructure, increase
the standard of living, support the corporations, etc.  With \'C\', \'D\', and
\'E\', the credit will flow in the opposite direction.  Economic resources
is what I was referring to.

Again, in the class \'A\' and \'B\' systems, the infrastructure to produce and
maintain the ships, as well as to educate and train the personnel to man
those ships is in place.  For the Class \'C\', \'D\' and \'E\' systems, this is
not necessarily true.  So it will be more expensive to train them in the
first place.

A good example of this occurred in WWII, the Pacific campaign.  US pilots
were rotated out of the theater after a number missions.  They returned to
the US and trained other pilots.  Thus, their experience was passed on the
the new pilots, and they were better prepared for what they would face
when they hit combat.  The Japanese, however, even tho\' their pilots were
initially better trained than US pilots, did not rotate pilots out of
combat.  As the war continued, attrition depleted the number of pilots
available, and the replacements were not nearly as good. 

(sigh - I did it again...please don\'t hit my hand too hard this time...)

Class \'A\' and \'B\' systems are going to be able to draw from a pool of
experience, and will have the resources to pass on experience to new
generations.  Class \'C\', \'D\', and \'E\' ports will not have the resources to
pass on that experience as effectively.

Yep, but only where the intra-system jump is significantly shorter than
the travel time through normal space.  A normal space freighter can make
the passage with twice the cargo that a jump-space freigher can.


Hans, 

You have made many good points.  I think the core of our disagreement lays
in the use of capital ships for anti-piracy and customs work, the number
of small ships available to any system, and the access that \'C\', \'D\' and
\'E\' systems will have to these ships.

Do you agree that corsairs (a career option available through much of
travellers existance) can exist if:

1) Supported by a private corporation and/or world government
2) Supported by a terrorist organisation

or 

3) Operates from outside established imperial borders, raiding into
Imperial space?

Note that I am not saying makes a profit here...just exists?

I hope this is what you needed. If not let me know!

I have included a list of items/equipment that the Imperial Scouts\'
Starship Inspection Service (much akin to the Coast Guard) would require
for all ships operating within the Imperium.

A minimum of one five-person LifePod for every five individuals aboard
(counting passengers and crew). Each LifePod is a self-contained 28-day
survival package designed to provide vaccum and atmospheric reentry
protection automatically deploying an altimeter released parachute. The
LifePod can also float and can be used as a shelter. It has a built-in
long-range communicator/transponder, basic life support sensor package,
air-conditioning/heating/air filteration system and portable chemical
toilet all powered by a removable portable mini-fusion power generator
along with an outside-deployable solar panel array. Five
fold-up/lock-down gravity couches with safety harnesses are standard and
function as sleeping beds. The oxygen scrubber system can recycle oxygen
and water for up to 2-weeks at which time the consumables kick in.

The LifePod has various lockers and containment areas for the following
equipment and supplies:

1 inerial locator/compass
5 flash lights with extra batteries
5 sleeping bags
5 emergency vacuum suits with bubble hard helmets
20 portable oxygen canisters for use with and without vac suits
70 two-liter containers of drinking water
140 units of survival rations with multi-purpose vitamines
2 fire extinguishers
2 large pump-type water purification devices
Portable video playback unit with complete library of survival and 
	medical reference literature and extra batteries
Pioneering Tool Kit consisting a digging tool, crowbar, dual-purpose 	
axe, hammer, screw driver set, adjustable wrench set, plier set, 
	wire cutters, hacksaw, power drill with assorted bits, assorted
	nails, screws, bolts, 50-foot heavy wire, 50-foot heavy nylon 		cord,
50-foot fishing line, 50-foot sewing thread, assorted
	needles, 50-foot heavy duct tape, multi-pack of super-glue
Wilderness Survival Kit containing 2 survival knifes, 10 snap flares, 
	2 survival machettes, 100 waterproof matches, sharpening tool, 		50
fuel tabs, assorted storage bags, fishing kit, insect 	repellant,
individual toilet sanation kits, 
First Aid Kit containing assorted bandages, scaples, wound seuter kit, 
	100 general purpose antibiotic tabs, 100 analgesic tabs, 
	Snake bite kit, 10 tubes of antiseptic cream, inflatable
	splints (for broken legs & arms), antiseptic soap, burn kit
50-foot Nylon Climbing Rope with fold-up grappling hook
1 standard autorifle with 100-rounds of ammunition
5 smoke grenades
1 radiation dosimeter with alarm
5 medium field packs

Jump projectors are part of the MegaTraveller ship design sequence in
the MT Referees book.  Since they are about TL 19 or 20 they have not
been reprinted since (presumably they were reguarded as a waste of space
- - albeit a cool waste of sppace).

Hey Rod, can I be a FS conceptual engineer candidate for designing the
man portable TL 15 Meson Gun using FF&S1 ?

Has anyone tried to design a man portable Meson gun using FF&S2 ?  Can
it still be done or has that bug (er feature) been eliminated ?

Yes, I\'ve seen it, too.  It is what many people call a typo.  As soon as I
saw it, I realized that millions of people make that same mistake every day.
 Yes, there is, horror of horrors, a typo on their webpage.

Just think about how angry you appear to be over that, and tell me, aren\'t
you being just a tiny bit anal and nitpicky?

Don\'t get me wrong, if I was the webpage designer contracted to design the
page, I\'d try not to let that happen.  I\'d double check my work.  However,
chances are, the guys who made the webpage weren\'t Traveller players.
 Someone slips with a finger, types "e" instead of "r", and then when
checking the page isn\'t versed enough in Traveller to pick up on the mistake
immediately.

I just don\'t see the anger about this...

And caused me serious internal injuries due to humor-related rib movement.
(actually the original question had a similar effect on me.)

I agree with most of Douglas\' comments. Especially about IG slowing down
their breakneck pace in favour of some proofing. I know it\'s important to
keep the products coming, but more so to make them as good as possible.
Taking an extra few weeks won\'y t hurt, and perhaps momentum could be
maintained by allowing licensed products? 

As for games shops: I\'d support a decent shop, but my \'local\' store is
difficult to get to, stocks nothing I want to see, and besides - how could
I hang around there talking to friends about RPGs? I have no friends
(unless you count those poor saps who turn up to be tormented every
wednesday night) - why do you think I feel the need to correspond with you
lot?  {end tongue-in-cheek mode}

\'In space there are not very many ways to hide, and none of them are
particularly effective, 
so we rely upon deception instead\'. Not catchy, but in my opinion, true.

So, yes.  Vargr Chew toys are in Traveller :)

Yes, as far as the rules go, I\'m not sold on GURPS.  However, background-wise

Well, the major mistake throughout the book is that all of the multiplication
signs ( * ) have been replaced with arrows and stuff ( <-> ).  It makes the
equations ugly and initially confusing...  But, all in all, its not that
tough to substitute a multiplication symbol for a funky arrow combination.

Granted, its somewhat unprofessional and all, and it is a shame that they
didn\'t do their homework and allow playtests, and didn\'t proof their work,
and etc etc...  But its done now, the book is usable with some clarifications
and such...

This post makes me think of checking the health of Traveller--the status
of its three physical stats and hit points, if you will--with our local
game shops.

What do you guys think of this?  The next time you are in your game
store, ask some similar questions that Bill has asked here.  Then, come
back and report to us on the TML.

This way, we\'ll all get a feel for our game and how it is selling.

List the questions you asked, the comments made by the people who work
there, and where you live.

Anybody else wanting to get a picture of how Traveller is selling to the
world?

That would be a truly enjoyable post to read.

Maybe we can set up a TML interview?  People take a week to write in
questions, a few are picked, and we send them to Courtney, Marc, or
Tim.  

Then they reply, and we all get to read the interview.

AMEN!!!

This is incredibly important.  I have very high hopes for T4.1 judging
from what I\'ve seen here on the list.

People are bitching about the screwed up typsetting in FF&S2, or the
screwed up data in FS.  These types of dead-head mistakes need to be
eliminated.

Because, if you get down to it, the IG MATERIAL is pretty good.  It\'s
the presentation that is completely lacking.

This is one of the truest things you\'ve ever said, Douglas.

The reason we sift through a hundred plus e-mails a day is because we
love the game.  It is a passion for us.

We want to see it be worthy of that passion, and we are very
dissapointed when we are, uh, er, disappointed.

Dave,
(rant on)
Once more you\'ve provided proof of the health of this game. As long as people are
interested in expanding it\'s horizons, officially or unofficially, and also willing to
share the fruits of that labor, IT WILL NOT DIE!

Sorry about that but I\'m soooo tired of every couple of weeks reading on this list that
Traveller is about to dry up and blow away. It the people doing the loudest crying would
put half that effort to making it better, as you and many others have, well...
(rant off)
At any rate thanks for the insight and the link, I\'m on my way there now...

Ken to advocate using a half-die is due to the fact that in Traveller,
damage seems to be treated in a very abstract way.  Damage is damage,

guns, etc), or by ludicrous amounts of radiation (lasers, plasma guns, etc).

	One of the reasons that I like Glenn\'s Hit Location Table so much
is that it allows a ref with a bit of common sense to take this into
account in narrating.

	Perhaps the problem isn\'t so much that Trav combat poorly models
_amount_ of damage but that it totally ignores _types_ of damage?

Note that I said "unlikely" rather than "when hell freezes over" or some such!
Yes, I can conceive of how IG would pick me up as a customer again -- but since,
as I\'ve said, it would involve them --

1) Getting a clue
2) Showing a commitment to quality rather than deadlines
3) Showing some evidence of *learning* from their mistakes
4) Producing a quality product

and there is, as I am sure we are all aware, less than a snowball\'s chance in
hell of this, then I am fairly safe in saying that it is never going to happen.

I suppose that it is just *barely* possible that a successful GURPSTrav will
give someone at Sweetpea the kick in the head/guts/nether regions that they need
to fire everyone at IG and replace them with competent staff, including line
editors, and to put in the capital needed to produce a quality product ... but
they haven\'t shown any sign of getting a clue so far, so why should we assume
that they ever will?

I could handle the maths behind FF&S and, I am sure, if I really cared enough, I
could handle the maths behind FF&S2. But I won\'t *ever* knowingly buy a product
that has missing tables (or anything else of importance) from IG again. Ever.
I\'ve been burnt once too often -- and I suspect that there are lot of players
and GMs out there, perhaps not on this list, who feel exactly the same way.

It is self-evidently self destructing. Look at all the new startup companies
that have produced products within the last 12 months or so and compare the
quality of their products with that of IG\'s. Companies like Biohazard Games
(Blue Planet), Myrmidon Games (Witchcraft), Daedalus (Feng Shui), Alderac
(Legend of the Five Rings), BTRC (3G3 etc.) and more. These companies have
produced a quality product, and (one expects) will continue to do so. What has
IG done? They have produced a very marginal product from day one -- it doesn\'t
matter *why* they have done this, the fact is that they have. Even a more or
less complete staff replacement has done nothing to change this -- in some ways
their incompetence has even gotten worse (they took a perfectly good effort on
the part of BITS, TLWH and Gateway, and managed to stuff it up because they
couldn\'t be bothered to FedEx proofs to Andy Lilly et al).

What I find so amazing is that more people aren\'t putting the boot into IG and
letting them know that they find their products unacceptable, their competence a
joke, and telling them that unless they get their act together they *will*
boycott their future products. Otherwise you are saying, "Oh well, its Ok if you
produce substandard products, because I\'m going to buy anything you do, no
matter how badly done."

No. GURPSTrav will be a success. Lots of people will buy it. It may never become
the definitive Traveller, but it *will* prove to Sweetpea (or whoever Sweatpea
sell the license to, if they decide that IG\'s demise is a sign that Traveller is
a dead dog) that there *is* a market for a well done standalone system ...
assuming that they can get a competent and well-financed team to do it.

>Can we try to be a little more supportive, please?

That\'s like never speaking ill of the dead just because they are dead. IG is a
joke, and unless it is forcibly made plain to them that they have to lift their
game, and *RIGHT NOW*, or they will go under, then we are doing no-one a favour.

Of course, being cynical, one could point out that few or no other game
companies would *NEED* to do this. The startup companies I have mentioned
previously *GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME*.

Sure, its OK that Marc is doing this. But you are missing the point that it
should *NEVER* have been necessary. EVER.

>Doesn\'t Marc and IG deserve some slack for this?

If there was some evidence -- *ANY* evidence -- they have got their act
together, yes. There is none to date. NONE. Every single product they have done
has had fairly major (tho, in some cases, ones you could [barely] live with)
flaws in layout, typesetting, errata, and missing material. EVERY ONE.

That\'s where we differ. I think *Marc* is trying -- and his efforts are being
ruined by the people at IG/Sweetpea (or whoever is responsible).

It\'s actually *my* hope as well, I just am not as optimistic as you and many

Yes. That\'s what I\'d like to see -- however, I do *not* see that IG is trying.
Their stuff is just as badly typo ridden now as it was when T4 1st Edition came
out over a year ago.

True, to a degree. But I still won\'t knowingly buy products that have major
typographical and layout flaws in them. Ever. I\'ve been burnt too many times,
and pretty much all of them by GDW (I have the infamous 1st printing of T:2300

0 Hit Poijts] or severely wounded [with 1 HP] because of incompetent
proofreading; not to mention 1st printing of MTrav!!!) and IG.

True

I\'d like to think they will -- but can see absolutely no evidence of it. In the

The point to a slab design is you can load the front up with armour, thus

It\'s a definitional question, really ... it\'s like asking what is a

Highly unlikely. One side-effect of piracy is small merchants adopting
convoy. And if they start co-operating on convoy, they\'ll start sharing
ground installation, pooling capital and so on. And then you dont have a
bunch of small, disorginised competitors any more.

The flip side is anti-pirate work is good operational training for the fleet.
The IN may well want to go on regular piracy sweeps, to keep crews skilled
and give it\'s captains and crews a taste of fire.

Small merchants also contribute to local economies, and pirates may get
uppitty and start raiding actual worlds.

Possible, but unlikely. If the pirates grow enough, sooner or later they 
are going to bushwhack a large megacorp freighter, and then some Sector
Director is going to lose their job ...

Vargr Chew Toys are a reality.  Challenge 59 1/2 - April Fool Issue

Yes, here it is, under Products:

The expanding human empires reach out among the stars and make contact with
two other interstellar civilizations: the Aslan, noble carnivors

Its not just *A* typo. (They misspelled \'carnivores\' in \'Aliens, Vol 1\' but
we won\'t mention it...)
Also, under First Survey:
	"This detailed UWP information is baed on data originally"
	\'baed\' should be\' based\'

And how about EA:

Emperor\'s Arsenal
- ----
Cleon\'s new Imperium holds the planets together by force of arms. Their
high-tech weaponry is revealed in this new supplement for Marc Miller\'s
Travller, complete with descriptionsm prices, and fantastic illustrations.
From fusion guns to accelerator rifles, all the weapons the Imperium has to
offer are found in The Emperor\'s Arsenal. 

\'Travller\' and \'descriptionsm\' are both typos.

From Milieu 0:
"It is the first in Imperium Games\' planned line of Milieu books, each
detailing a range of years during the Third Imperium\'s long existance"

\'existance\' should be spelled \'existence\'

From FF&S:

"down to the last detail to suit your adventurers or your campaignsystem." 
\'campaignsystem\' should be, of course, two words

And, from JTAS25,
"Now they can discover just what tht "cargo" is"
\'tht\' should be \'that\'

Not really, they are all just YAT4TO (Yet Another T4 TypeO).  Its kinda like
the
last straw, that one last thing, after you\'ve endured the same thing over
and over, *one* more comes at you from an unexpected direction.

*Sigh*

Yeah, I got typos on my own web pages, and I do get paid to produce pages
with no mistakes, but I try to eliminate all of them.  Still, some slip by.

True, but someone well versed in Traveller should have reviewed the site,
pointed out the mistake, and had it fixed.  (The other typos require no
special knowledge of Traveller)  Would have taken 5 minutes to fix the typo,
another 5 minutes publishing it.   I write internal web pages/applications
for the number three supplier of financial information in the world.  On a
busy day, it might take me an hour from the moment I finds out about a typo
to it being fixed. 

How long has these typos been in existence?

Its not anger as much as hopelessness.  Unfortunately, its just another example
of IG\'s problems.  None of them are unfixable, but IG does seem to be reluctant
to attempt to sometimes.

By the way, who is actually responsible for IG\'s site?  Is OPX being paid
for this?

Hey Ken!

Now that you\'ve accepted the .5d, I guess I\'m the last hold out. ;->  So,
how let\'s  go "whole hog" with those 1d3\'s!

Instead of rolling 2d6 for Attributes, let\'s roll 3d3!  The range, 3 to 9,
is a *much* nicer one and it ought to sell a ton of those d3\'s you\'re going
to  manufacture with your new dice factory. ;-p

GURPS does this, IMO, it carries it\'s details a little far and that is part
of what gives it a reputation for having a slow and complicated combat
system.  However, in general, I agree with you that it would be a good idea
to differentiate between blunt trauma and penetrating trauma, at least. 
Energy weapons do penetrating damage, in part, and maybe we should include
burn damage as well, that\'s an important and different kind of damage.

Any ideas on how we could incorportate this without getting overly
complicated?

Perhaps Blunt Trauma only counts as 1/4 to 1/2 of the damage from penetrating? 
 A boxer can withstand quite a few punches to the body and while each one does 
damage, it does not really weaken him rapidly.

Taking this into consideration, then the base damage for some blunt items 
would need to be increased to compensate.  You get hit in the head with a 
boulder, you are likely to suffer some immediate and permanent effects.  

Some armors should still absorb some blunt attacks, however, there should 
still be some damage applied to the character as my baseball bat hits your 
armor, while you didn\'t feel the bat, you did feel your armor hit you with a 
reduced amount of the force.

   I used to do it your way until I noticed it says "the damage value"
of the shot.  Damage value in TNE for a weapon is "the number of D6 (or
D10 in my case) rolled."  This is why some people started multipling the
damage value times 2 for the purposes of determining a quick kill from a
head shot.

   BTW, part of why I started experimenting with 1 second melee combat
turns is because I still use D6 for melee combat.  Since most people
don\'t fire their guns 5 times in a regular combat turn, you can
generally get more strikes in against the bad guy using melee combat,
but the damage you can inflict "blow for blow" is better with a gun.

   Amen.  It\'s also *amazing* to see the changes in behavior you can
evoke from battledress equipped troopers when suddenly the bad guys stop
using assault rifles and start using plasma and fusion rifles...

   My thinking, which I just expressed in a prior post, was that melee
combat should be conducted in 1 second segments instead of the usual
five seconds, which means you can perform 5 seperate melee combat
segments during a regular 5 second combat turn.  Therefore while the
martial artist with a sword is only doing D6s of damage, on average
(since you usually don\'t fire your weapon five times in a combat turn)
he can still inflict just as much damage (or more) as a guy holding a
gauss pistol and firing twice.

Example: Thor strikes a bad guy with his trusty sword four times in a
combat turn (he spent the other melee combat segment blocking).  Thor
has a strength of 10.  Therefore his sword was able to do 8D6 of total
damage (average of 3.5 x 8 = 28 pts.) to the bad guy, assuming no
exceptional success.  Tony shoots a bad guy with his trusty gauss pistol
twice in a combat turn (a third shot missed).  The gauss pistol does
2D10 damage.  Again assuming no exception success is rolled, Tony\'s
pistol is able to do 4D10 of total damage (average of 5.5 x 4 = 22 pts.)
to the bad guy.

   Well Xena  :-), who is going to keep the bad guys from breaking into
your ship while the crew is away and doing acts of severe sabotage?  My
players have learned through hard experience that security measures can
be by-passed, and having somebody stand guard from inside (somebody who
can also fly the ship and come rescue the rest of the party when they
need it) is the only way to go.

Well, as I have said, I really don\'t agree that traffic regulations
would be seen as warranted by the threat.  However, in any case, when
a patrol ships pulls up for yet another routine inspection would be
a good time to launch a suprise attack.

Yes, you did miss it.  I too miss things.  I have agreed that there
would be no piracy in the Regina system.  It would occur in more
fringe systems.  If you want to invoke the ability of high pop worlds
to field forces to stop all piracy, then you have to disperse forces to
all the systems, otherwise piracy will simply occur in the systems
without forces.  Nor, as I have said, is your scheme for required
entry departure points sufficient to change this.

I don\'t believe a scout in a system will be enough to stop piracy for
reasons I have elucidated concerning it\'s lack of coverage and
insufficient firepower.

Well, with fixed rates a 1% change in costs can be (if the profit margin
is 20%) a 5% change in profits.  Without fixed costs they will be
in a competative sitation and can\'t just pass the cost along.
[The idea that just because a cost is small you can assume it
will be treated as if it doesn\'t exist is a classic mistake on this
mailing list.]
The fact is that business don\'t pay costs that are a waste of money
because they are "small".  They pay them when the consequences of
not paying them outways the cost.  You are balancing something that
is long shot to ever happen (piracy) against something that happens
in _every_ jump (fuel costs and loss of time).  The small cost
that happens every time adds up.

>>Why would the government demand it if trade didn\'t want it.  It\'s not

>Why wouldn\'t trade want it? Piracy is bad.

It\'s bad for the mercants.  The reasons they oppose it is because
the merchants don\'t like it.  If they merchants think the solution
is to costly, then the Imperium isn\'t going to win any points with
the merchants.

[Stuff about piracy being bad for merchants...]

But the same thing applies to piracy.  If you buy this arguement then
you have to figure that the only motivation is to keep general trade
costs low and to do this they are going to look at the costs of
piracy and the costs of wasted fuel and time and going to take
the cheaper.  It doesn\'t take a big change in costs for piracy
to be cheaper if they only take one out of every 1,000, or 10,000,
cargos.

Well, I guess this is in they eye of the beholder.  I have found your
arguement in sufficient myself.  I am happy to stand on my arguements
and let others decide from themselves and that we will have to agree
to disagree.

>If you think I\'m interpreting them wrong, show

I have.  If you missed it, e-mail me and I will reiterate (but please
be brief, I don\'t have a lot of time to reiterate arguements).

So you aren\'t eliminating the piracy, just changing the victims.

As I have said, the ship can simply pose as an innocent ship and I
have not read anything that counters this.

>>Also, the pirate doesn\'t need to be lurking in the exact spot.

>If he wants to remain hidden he has to lurk deep enough in the Gas Giant
>that he can\'t be spotted by sensors.

This is one way.  Or he can pose as an innocent ship.  However, my
main point is that it takes some time for the ship to make it\'s way
in from the jump limit, skim it\'s fuel, and move out.  The pirate
can move considerably in that time.

>That puts him low enough to degrade
>his own sensors

Actually, it works in his favor since it is easier to look out from
a planet than in at it.  The pirate will be using the emmissions of
the planet more than the atmosphere.  In any case, the pirate could
_also_ hide in and use a confederate to detect the other ship.  It
could also simply jump in at the limit, spot ships between them and the
planet (or are simply nearby) and go after them.

A ship refueling at a gas giants has considerable time where he
is unable to jump away.  (If it comes in empty, refueling may be
it\'s only choice)  It think to assume that it will be able to
automatically spot a pirate before it spots him is questionable at
best.  When you add in the question of how does he know which
ships are pirates (in fact, pirates may in fact be also operating
as merchants) things are even more iffy.

>>Just like any other system, he can spot you on the way in or out.
>
>Oh, that\'s right. He won\'t be down there in the first place, because he

Well, now we are back to more than one scout ships gaurding a system.
Even then, you are going to need a short response time because
the pirate may simply poses as a normal ship.  He may, in
fact, be a legitimate trader who engages in piracy on the side.
Or he simply can jump in and take targets of opportunity.   Or
he (if you are just using scout ships) ambush one.  In any
case, the first evidence of piracy may will be the start of the
attack.

>>If you want to suppose the Imperium has a similar view of piracy,

I don\'t agree.  Low level piracy has been tolerated by pirates
in numerous historical situation.  It is only when it becomes
a big problem that people will devote big recources.

I agree.

>who wants Something Done About This Outrage.

Well, I simply don\'t agree that you can do it with a scout ship in
a system.  I don\'t agree that you required departure scheme is
such an obvious way to go or that you only need to guard the
main planet.  Most systems are going to have traffic in and
out of gas giants, worlds being mined, and any world with
a population.  To stop pirates you are going to need significant
resources at all these worlds and you are going to need to do
that in every system.

>>I did. I\'ve pointed out that you will need a couple of dozen for each
>>world
>
>And I\'ve pointed out that you would have those dozens. And scores.

OK, so if you need 25 ships at each world (or 50 if you want to
get by with system defense boats because as ship that small is
going to need a partner) and you have 5 worlds in most systems
with significant traffic (as an average, some will have less,
somewill have more), then you need at least 125 ships in
each system (more if the pirates simply start grouping up).
Then you need to do this at every system in the Imperium.  That
is not a trivial number of ships.

What is more, then you have to postulate that the Imperium decides
that keeping 125 (or more) ships in a low traffic system where
they are only going to have a merchant loose his cargo now and
then is worth it.  It is very likely that it would be cheaper
to offer free cargo insurance.

>>and will need to protect any world in a system that supports trade

In all the system descriptions I\'ve seen, there is some mining
of other planets, even when the main world has a modest population
and there is alway traffic in and out of the gas giants.

>>Then you need to do this in every system in the Imperium.
>
>And a lot of those systems will only need to have one world patrolled.

The number of systems with one one populated planet and no gas giant
is low.

No.  If they spot the cruiser they just move on.  The fact is that
such random patrols are ineffective in stopping hit and run attacks.

>And, again, a pirate don\'t like fighting

Well, this is true if they are out matched.  If the pirates match
the Imperium and attack with suprise, then there can well be a future
in it.

>Btw., you can keep a cruiser

Yeah, but can you keep dozens to hundreds of them at every system?
If not, the pirates will just attack where they aren\'t.

OK.

You guys are making me laugh!

Of course I use half die--anytime I need to roll 1-3.

I like Glenn\'s table as well, and I do use it--every shot.

Maybe so and probably right.  But, I think the amount of damage has
something to do with it too.

It stands to reason that I can hurt you a lot more and a lot faster if I
cut you deep with knife rather than hit you as hard as I can with my
fist.

Would you rather face a guy with a knife, or a guy with his bare hands?

I\'d pick bare hands any day.

In Traveller, the characters don\'t care.

I think much could be gained by sitting down and taking a dispassionate
look at exactly what IG has produced, what IG is doing wrong and what IG
is doing right. This post is going to be *long*, so you might want to skip
it; ut I think I\'m saying things here which need to be said and remembered.

So to start, the products (1 rules book, 11 supplements, 2 adventures, 1
gamescreen and 2 JTAS).

The Traveller rule book: Well generally this is an okay product. There are
a fair number of minor typos (words misspelt here and there, gramatical
errors etc) and three major ommissions (jump drive table, the Thruster and
jumpdrive error in QSDS (out by a factor of 14) and the rank mustering out
benefit table). Okay, so the minor typos can be a little irritating, though
most are invisible (ie you probably won\'t notice them unless they are
pointed out); the two major omissions are annoying but IG issued an errata
quickly and they don\'t detract too much. Overall, the product show all the
signs of badly rushed production. A good product.

Starships: Well this is a fairly major stuff up, many of the predesigned
ships are simply a joke, the deckplans definitely are a joke. However SSDS
is robust and useable with no major errors. Now since non-gearheads have
to rely on materials such as this for ships etc. this is bad; there should
have been some major bottom kicking at IG over this, but from all accounts
there was. Still the basic design system is sound, so the product is useable.
A poor product.

Central Supply Catalog: A couple of minor typos, but they are minor. The
major \'problem\' with CSC is the canon-breaking potential of some of the
equipment contained within. Most of this stems from Greg Porter\'s apparent
desire to produce a supplement useable cross milieu whilst also staying
in "M:0 character" (a truely laudable goal). So it has prompted a whole lot
of hand waving here on the list (not neccessarily a bad thing) and caused
another potential problem down the line, but the "M:0 character" really does
add to the product way out of proportion to it\'s potential problems. An
excellant product.

Aliens Archive: Okay, I don\'t like Aliens Archive. The larger typesize really
makes the product stick out from the others and makes me think it was
\'streched\' from insufficent material. But other than that, there are no major
typos or layout problems. Since we can\'t really challange the races included
on the grounds of scientific reality (we have only one example of a worldwide
ecyosystem to base our theories on), so the only challange to this can be
that the races are \'cardboard\' in a storytelling sense. Well, they\'re not.
They are not as well drawn as the races from the CT alien modules or the DPG
supplements; but we can\'t expect that given the space limitations. They are
better drawn than the JTAS contact articles; and they all fit into a distinct
campaign niche and will add to a game. A good product.

Milieu 0: Again no major typos and the minor ones are effectively invisible.
Okay there is a major potential canon conflict in it (the part Vilani Cleon
and pure Vilani Artemsus) which has prompted some really furious handwaving.
But the material presented is all good solid stuff, the Milieu is welldrawn
and the additional rules for political campaigns are a positive boon. Okay
so the core sector data has a major problem (the Govt/Law snafu) but this
does not detract too much (I\'ll cover this snafu in detail with FS). All
round this is still an excellent product, if the data in the sector map
wasn\'t broken, it would be outstanding.

First Survey: Okay, this has *major* problems. Firstly there is the Govt/Law
snafu. Quite simply this should never have happened. Somebody should have
picked this up. Secondly, the data just plain doesn\'t make sense. There are
way to many high tech planets and there are planets with pop factor B. This
entire product shows signs of sloppy editing and non-existant proofing. As
with Starships some bottoms should have been well and truely kicked over
this; but then again, apparently they were. Still with some significant work
the product is useable (edit the high tech and high pop worlds and reroll
the law levels). Overall a very poor product, the worst that IG has produced.

Emperor\'s Arsenal: Again, minor typos, some of which are annoying. Suffers
the same potential canon-breaking problem of CSC for exactly the same reason.
However even having said all that, this is an product to be proud of. All
this is good solid stuff, good imaginative descriptive text, good artwork,
good equipment; well worth a place on any bookshelf. An excellant product.

Pocket Empires: Well, what can one say. This is simply the best thing IG has
put out to date. A few inconsitancies in the descriptive text, but these are
invisible and even if they weren\'t it wouldn\'t matter. One minor table left
out, well it\'s a very minor table and has been widely circulated. PE can be
used with any version of Traveller with minor modifications and pretty much
in any milieu. To put it simply, it\'s outstanding.

Anomalies: Okay, layout good, no major typos, no missing tables etc. On to
the adventures themselves. Well they\'re all imaginative and challanging,
however there are some problems. First there\'s "Lock and Loot" with the now
imfamous TL 14 laser pistols and vacc suits. Then there\'s "Lone Whisper".
While this is on the face of it a good adventure, challanging and inovative.
But it takes a horse and cart and drives it right through canon. Releasing
one of Grandfathers children into the universe might not have an effect on
canon in M:0, but it will in M:1100. But, despite these two exceptions, these
adventures are good, challanging and worth the time and trouble of running
them. A fair product, would be better if "Lone Whisper" and "Lock and Loot"
were fixed.

Psionic Intitutes: No missing tables, no major typos, I\'ve not found any minor
ones either, but doubtless they\'re there (I have yet to see a 128 page 1st
edition of *anything* without them). This supplement takes a poorly defined
but oft used element of Traveller (Psionics) and puts some *long* overdue
flesh on it\'s bones. Well thoughtout and well written, with a little work
useable in any milieu. An outstanding product, rivals PE for best so far.

Fire, Fusion and Steel: Well we all know about the multiplication sign typo,
that should not have got through. Miss it once, maybe, twice perhaps, every
single time; no way, shear incompetance all down the line in production (NOTE
this is not the authors fault, this is the production teams fault; in the
draft sent to IG they were okay); and an important table was missed out.
However these errors are not fatal, if an errata had been released, I don\'t
think anyone would have minded too much. But as far as I know, no offical
errata has *ever* been produced. Lets put this bluntly, this is just not good
enough. FFS2 is an excellent product and even with the production mess it\'s
quite useable. But without the control table the vehicle design sequence is
fatally flawed. With an errata it\'s an excellant product, without it\'s only
fair.

Milieu O Campaign: Takes M:0 and FS and puts them in one hardcover book, adds
yet more good stuff to M:0 (note this was not omitted in error, it was omitted
to bring the book within size limits; a common practice). Okay so this makes
M:0 even better and the extra pages mitigate some of the worst excesses of FS.
However even with the rules on extended Law Level (very good rules BTW), there
is still the problem of the pop B worlds and just too many TL C+ worlds. Takes
M:0 up to outstanding and FS up to fair.

Long Way Home and Gateway: It\'s probably best to look at these two as one item.
A good adventure campaign, challanging and capturing the feel of the milieu
well. Not taking the world data from these and putting it into M:0 campaign
is something that IG should be kicking themselves over. However, they\'re not
without their typos, some of which are getting on being major. The biggest
problem with these is the canon-breakng nature of the central premis of the
campaign (a method of long distance jump direct from a worlds surface), this
requires some major league handwaving to incorporate. Overall good products,
but that canon problem really is annoying.

Journal of Travellers Aid Society: Biggest problem with these is that there
has only been two of them. After a year there should be four issues. Since
these are the logical choice for IG to communicate with it\'s customer base
this is a major problem. However the articles have ranged from fair to
excellent, and overall I\'d put both issues down as good products.


Okay, so what is IG doing wrong? Firstly, too many products show all the
signs of being rushed. Slow down the production schedule. Stop aiming for
one supplement a month, drop it down to something realistic like one every
six weeks or one every two months. Get that right, then push up the rate.
Thankfully IG do show signs of doing this, T4.1 is being held back until it\'s
right; but more needs to be done.

Secondly, errata. IG need to get their act together regarding errata now.
Mistakes happen, everyone knows this. I really don\'t think it\'s possible to
put out a 128 page book without at least a few errors in the first printing.
However when they are found, an errata has to be issued in a timely fashion.
IG is not doing this, the errata section on their web site has not been
updated in over six months, no offical errata since CSC. For crying out loud
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER. If anything is going to kill IG it will be this.
Further to this, IG has to pull finger with JTAS. This is the ideal vehicle
to get these errata out, but it\'s production is just too sporadic at the
moment to be useable.

So what is IG doing right? IG\'s products are some of the best on the market
underneigth it all. The T4 game system is one of the best around, fast, easy
to play, releastic where it counts and eminantly expandable. Sure it could
do with a little polishing around the edges (bring on T4.1), but it is very
good. The supplements are (with a two very notable exceptions) quality items
only held back by poor (read rushed) production standards.

Then we move on to Marc W. Millar. His attitude and actions are quite
litterally amazing. Would that all games producers learnt from him. I don\'t
think it\'s unreasonable to say that he is the best thing going for both IG
and Traveller.


So to the future. What does it hold? Despite everything, I think IG is still
the best/last chance Traveller has of surviving as an independent game system.
Sure GURPS: Traveller will come out and will sell. But G:T is *NOT* Traveller,
it\'s GURPS and I plain old fashioned don\'t like GURPS and don\'t think it will
translate well. Firstly there\'s the Metric/Imperial problem. The use of the
Metric system is one of the things to me which gives Traveller its "feel".
Call me old fashioned if you will, but somehow the idea of the 3rd Imperium
measuring everything in yards, pounds and gallons just doesn\'t sit right (just
how many gallons of L-Hyd to the displacement ton?). Then there\'s the GURPS
Tech levels; Traveller tech may have it\'s problems, but GURPS is worse. [Okay
so enough GURPS bashing for now]
So if IG goes under and G:T is out there, do you honestly expect anyone other
than SJG to pick up Traveller? I sure as heck wouldn\'t, just too much risk.
The most likely senario in this event is SJG getting the licence to produce
the offical timeline as well as the alternate one (which would kill the
alternate BTW). So lets not beat about the bush; if T4 fails, Traveller is
almost certain to die as an independent game. Sure no big deal to me or most
other established players, but while the 3rd Imperium might survive as part
of GURPS, the 3rd Imperium is not all there is to Traveller.

PS. I want to send this to IG, but I\'m not sure who to send it to. Can anybody
give me any pointers?

But people can pull their trigger fingers a lot faster than other people
can swing swods several feet.  Why should the person with the melee

She was using a frisbee long before I ever heard of Xena.  During
charecter generation she had about Cr 11 left after buying a good Vac
suit & I needed to give her a cheap personalizing hobby trait (besides
borderline paranoia which was free and being a bi*** which was courtsey
of a Charisma (TNE import) of 4).  Thus was born the frisbee, at Cr 1 or
2 and 150 grams or so it fits in any charecters budget & luggage :) We
need official stats for the frisbee _now_, official stats for the
frisbee are almost as important a game need as official stats for the
milk bottle are :) 

On Esi-Obe an isolated planet within the Great Rift (Esi-obe Corridor
0638 A542886-C Po 211 Na G4 V N) one of the local daimyos had asked the
charecters what they did for exercise (most charecters were nobles & the
local noble interpreted Knight as = Samurai).  Sigrid pulled out her
frisbee and showed him how to invent them starting from peasants plastic
dinner plates.  The very next week fashionable young Samurai were using
frisbees with razor edges to decapitate "uppity" peasants.  The
resulting popular backlash caused a peasant reveolt that appeared to be
well on the way towards overthrowing the planetary government when the
charecters decised to get the h*** out of Dodge, as it were.

The party I was in learned that if the ref wants your ship screwed your
ship will get screwed whether there is a guard or not, then you have a
corpse or a hostage rescue sitation as well.  In addition the session
will not be very much fun for the player whose charecter is stuck on the
ship. This is a game and is supposed to be fun. 

 Staying on the ship is for NPC\'s and the charecers of players who were
late to the session.  (Not to mention George the ships "Engineering"
robot who had integral Battle Dress skin "to protect against exteme
environmental conditions" and a PGMP "for rapid cutting and repair of
dammaged hull metal" who was invented & marketed by a very degenerate
sector wide corporation run by a noble ex scout sector administarator
with a larcenous bent.  George had a starhip kill marker painted on his
side for the 500 ton starship he had destroyed in persoanl combat -
courtsey of a well aimed shot at the power plant which resulted in a
series of cascade failures on the ship critical dammage chart.) We had
just crossed the Great Rift the hard way and needed some relaxation. 
For Sigrid this just happened to be swimming & playing frisbee.  For two
other members of the party it was shopping.  When they went to the bank
in the mall two blocks from the beach to convert their gold into
Imperial credits there just happened to be a bank robbery.  Naturally
upon hearing about the robbery over the ships com net Sigrid rushed to
help her shipmates.  Besides a 12 dice shotgun blast to the heart the
bank robbers also blew a hole in her frisbee.  When Sigrid sued the bank
for dammages (negligence in not preventing the robbery) she listed the
value of the Frisbee (TM) which she had picked up at campaign start on
Terra itself as Cr 10,000 or so because it would have cost a lot more
than that to import one from Terra to the Deneb Sector.  She then went
out and bought a local substitute for Cr 1 & pocketed the rest of her
winnings.

Of course a scout will not be able to prevent anything. It will even have
instructions to remain quiscent no matter what. A scout is supposed to get
information. Scouts do mean that pirates will have to base themselves in
deep space rather than in empty systems, which will increase their overhead.
You overlooked that the ships I said might as well do a spot of work are
the pickets.

Sure. But the thing that applies to piracy and dosen\'t apply to traffic
control is that everybody agrees that piracy is a bad thing while not
everybody agrees that traffic control is a bad thing.

I never went away from it. The major point of my argument is not that it
dosen\'t take considerable assets to suppress piracy, but that it takes
considerably less than is available. A situation that has its parrallels
in Earth history: piracy flourishes when the forces of law and order are 
weak and languish when they are strong.

Fallacy. See below.

But never when those governments had sufficient patrol ships to do something
about it. There\'s a difference between ignoring piracy somewhere because you 
don\'t have the ships to deal with it and ignoring it when you do have them.

It\'s a good thing I never claimed that, then, because I don\'t agree with
that either.

The average population of a Traveller world is 1.5 billion (The Imperium
of 1100 has 10,000 worlds and 15 trillion inhabitants). On the average out
of 36 planets you have:

1 with population 0
2  "      -"-     1
3  "      -"-     2
4  "      -"-     3
5  "      -"-     4
6  "      -"-     5
5  "      -"-     6
4  "      -"-     7
3  "      -"-     8
2  "      -"-     9
1  "      -"-     A

With a total population of 540 billion people (36*1.5 billion).

At Cr500 per person in naval taxes you get a naval budget of 270,000,000 MCr.
Let\'s err on the side of caution and cut that by a third = 180,000,000 MCr.
Such a budget represents a fleet costing 1,800,000,000 MCr. 1/1000th of that
is 1,800,000 MCr. 200 T patrol cruisers are used for piracy suppression, so
presumably they are a match for the average pirate; you can get about 7000
patrol cruisers for 1,800,000 MCr. But let\'s say the Navy thinks patrol
ships are sissy and opts for 1200 T Kinunir Class ships instead. You can
get about 1,800 Kinunirs for 1,800,000 MCr. (All figures are CT).

System defense budgets for your average population 7 world is 70% of 
7,500 MCr, which gives such a world a system defense force equivalent to
roughly 50 Kinunirs (or 200 patrol ships). I think the average pop 7
world can take care of itself, but let\'s again err on the side of caution
and only postulate that the six worlds of population 8, 9, and 10 can
deal with pirates on their own. That leaves 30 out of the 36 worlds to
spread those 1,800 Kinunirs around on, or 60 apiece _on the average_.
And that\'s without counting the 200 Kinunirs (or the equivalent) that
the 4 pop 7 worlds can have on their own and the 25 that the 5 pop 6
worlds can have.

I think that would be enough to make life tedious for most pirates,
don\'t you?

>Most systems are going to have traffic in and out of gas giants, worlds 
>being mined, and any world with a population. 

Except that very few systems will have traffic in and out of Gas Giants
I agree with you. But there will be a correlation between the population
of the system and the number of places with activity, won\'t there? I mean,
very few of the systems with less than a 1000 people will have them spread
out across the system. That\'s 6 (or let\'s call it 5) of our 30 systems that
only require one spot guarded. Put 5 Kinunirs in each of those and you have
1775, an average of 71 left for the 25 other systems. I\'m sure you can see
where this is going. The average number of places to guard in a system is
not going to be anywhere near 10, and if it was, we could put 6 Kinunirs
(or, more likely, 1 Kinunir and 20 patrol cruisers) in each spot on the 
proposed budget.

Either the pirates jump in blind near a spot where they have a chance to
surprise prey, in which case they arrive within range of any armed ships
stationed there, or they arrive out of range of the patrols, in which
case they will be too far from their prey to surprise it. You\'re trying
to have it both ways, and it can\'t be done.

Same mistake. Either the pirates jump into a system cautiously, in which
case the patrol ships _and all the merchants they are guarding_ can get
away by jumping, or they take a chance on surprising the patrol ships.
And in the latter case, if they pull it off, the Navy send out more ships
(they do have 999 times more where the first ones came from), while the 
pirates only have to be unlucky once for the whole thing to be over.

>>Btw., you can keep a cruiser permanently with quite a few of the patrols 
>>and still keep within the budget I postulate.
> 
>Yeah, but can you keep dozens to hundreds of them at every system?
>If not, the pirates will just attack where they aren\'t.

Same mistake again. The pirates labor under the same two-week information
delay that everybody else does. There\'s no way they can know if a rowing 
patrol will be there when they jump in.

Then there\'s the question of how the pirates got together a fleet that
can challenge around 6,000 T worth of warship in the first place. In
order to be assured of a relatively cheap victory the pirate fleet has
to outnumber the patrol considerably. The average Vargr corsair band 
will have trouble with that. Add a few cruisers (and I admit you will
have to dig into the remaining 999/1000th of the budget for that)and even 
the Vargr will decide to look elsewhere. Another 1/1000th will buy you 1000 
30,000 T light cruisers or about 33 per system on the average; that ought
to do it.

	Be even more afraid, for I have an answer for him ...

From a 13 Feb 97 post by David Crew, fusing 10Td of hydrogen will release
approximately 20,000,000 TJ of energy (that\'s 20,000,000,000,000,000,000J).
So your 1Td will give you 2,000,000TJ at 100% efficiency. Pick your
efficiency level (PLEASE!!!! Around 1% or less ...), and vape\'em.

some/many/heaps of flaws.

2. Most of us agree that IG hasn\'t implemented our pet \'fix\'

3. Most of us agree that many/most of the products are useable, but flawed.

Yes? No?

Right then. 

Let us see what we all want. I don\'t mean which supplement or huge sweeping
change. I mean what feasable changes can be made to future products to make
them wonderful....
Here\'s my pitch for What I Want From IG:

	1. Adequate proofreading and editing, even if it slows things down.

	2. An integrated system, such that FFS2 is useable (IF desired)
	
	3. Text on the back covers. (see below)

	4. Backup for the loyal fans who\'ve bought the (flawed?) products so far,
such that we don\'t have to buy the new versions unless we feel like it.

(Text: I always wanted text on the back cover. We got it with PE but it was
badly done. Next time it\'ll be properly laid out and punctuated. A steady
improvement.)

	Traveller looks good on the shelf, but the casual browser will be turned
off by simple presentation errors. So what I want most of all is to FIX
THOSE PRESENTATION ERRORS! Content of the recent materials is, after all,
excellent. 

	Now: here\'s my plan - we compile a list of what we want, numbers of people
here on the list who agreed, and send it to IG. That way they\'ll know what
we want. If they then fail to deliver, we can all get upset about it and
wait for GURPS Traveller (not me. It\'s T4 or back to the house rules!)
	
	But hey - it\'ll all be fixed with T4.1.

	Won\'t it?

Strange.  If I find myself in a hardware store without a tape measure and I
have to measure something, I simply "borrow" one of theirs off the shelf :)

Actually these FF&S2 numbers look like they come from the FF&S2 Errata List
on my Web page.  The omission of the wedge numbers was pointed out on the
GDW-Beta list.  However since no one supplied the missing information, I went
ahead and calculated the missing numbers base on the classic Scout/Courier
and the Length Multiplier from the original FF&S.  BTW, if anyone is
interested my FF&S Errata list is located at:

Sounds to me like he\'s just terribly confused.  My understanding is that
GURPS Traveller is going to be, like most of the GURPS books, a one shot.
 The alternate history (and I believe, although I may be incorrect, that both
Marc Miller and Loren Wiseman both said this.  At any rate, I\'m pretty sure
that Loren did.) will be just that, and alternate history.

And seeing as this agreement was made about a month ago, and since then
Emperor\'s Vehicles has come out, I don\'t think that he\'s right.

Well, hell.  What can I say.  There was more than one typo on the page.  I\'m
still not terribly horrified.  I just can\'t get up a full head of steam about
this.  It is, after all, a webpage.  People make mistakes.  How about you

is and *SEND* it to IG so that they can fix their mistakes?

Ack!  *If* this rumour was true, I\'d say that Traveller as we know it would
cease to exist for many Traveller fans, just like the introduction to TNE
did to so many others.  Just imagine the only remaining "canon" character
generation system consisting of GURPS\' own point-based system, or the EDU
or SOC stats being reduced to Advantages and/or Disadvantages (not to
mention the metric/imperial and TL issues).  It would simply be too far of
a stretch from the traditional Traveller rules that have existed in the
last four editions for many people to support.

Once SJG gets a hold of the rights to Traveller, it would be highly
unlikely that someone else could obtain them so as to begin producing
Traveller as it was originally done by GDW.  Additionally, I very much
doubt that SJG would support G:T anywhere near as much as IG-- it\'s just
not possible under a "generic" rules system.  Give me a small gaming
company like IG, with their-- albeit error-ridden-- Traveller-specific
products, over SJG, with G:T & one or two other Traveller-specific
sourcebooks (not including Ultra-Tech, whose science isn\'t "hard" enough
for many Traveller players), any day.

Jump projectors, fah... MT listed the same thingy that
the Star Wars guys love to throw around... the 
\'Jump Supressor\' AKA \'Hyperspace Interdictor\'.

Who wants to _make_ ships jump? (Well, ok, me, sure)
Much better - preventing people from jumping. Keeps
those damn scouts & couriers from jumping off with news
of battle...

A show of hands - in a fleet action, which would
you rather have, a jump projector or a jump interdictor?

A jump interdictor would be easier to make than a jump
projector, as all you have to do is crank up a gravity
well big enough to make people think twice about jumping...
of course, creating such a gravity well would make it
pretty easy for missles to hit you (to say the least).
Maybe there\'s other ways to do it though.

Aside from the nagging doubt that the ship with the PCs
on it that\'s been jump-projected away from the field of battle
will show up at an inopportune moment for the bad guys
somewhere much later on, a jump projector is essentially 
a super-killer one-shot disentegrator, so I suppose it\'s not
much of a question.

(Doug, what you need, I suppose, is a \'Coke Interdictor\'
for when you get surprised by TML posts...)

The Sylea Scale (SS) was first published in -2 by Josef Kammler, a well-
known sophontologist on Sylea.  Developed from a grant awarded to him by
Ling Standard Products (Marketing Unit), it was used as a scale to allow
ease of planning for the New Products division.
 
It measures, by means of two variables, the degree of integration into the
(then Federation) Imperial culture for any given world.  The variables
are denoted by SS(S) and SS(T), for Social and Technological integration.
 
The basic formulation was later adapted to some nearby Pocket Empires,
so in some cases, the "Sylea" Scale may be considered to be named
anachronistically.
 
 
Referee:  Evaluate the nature of the world and decide on which assignments
to SS(S) and SS(T) are appropriate.  If no ideas come to mind, the 2D6
table and DMs may be used.  Determine SS(S) or Social Integration first,
and then determine SS(T) or Technological Integration.  This system is
compatible with Pocket Empires and Milieu: 0 Campaign, and both books may
be referred to.

  Code  - The code to be recorded for determining Integration of the planet
 
  Degree of Integration -
 
    Completely Integrated:
      Just as if you were on Sylea.
 
    Highly Integrated:
      Strongly influenced by the Imperium, however there will still be
      ways that the planet/system has not adopted from Imperial society.
 
    Moderately Integrated:
      This system has not (likely) been a member of the Imperium for long.
      It maybe somewhat isolated from the jump routes making regular trade
      contact more difficult, or it may be a fairly new member of the
      Imperium.  There are plenty of reasons why this world is Moderately
      Integrated.
 
    Somewhat Integrated:
      Like Moderately Integrated, only even more so.
 
    Not Integrated:
      Likely a Pocket, a Pillar World, or an Interdicted planet/system.
 
  Throw - The 2D6 throw used by the referee to determine if the level of
          Integration permits something, i.e. "Does a Ling Standard Products
          store exist on this planet?", or "Can I find an LSP Inertial Locator"
          on this planet?", or "Will they recognize my Knighthood here?"
 
  Pillar Worlds
 
    A world that is not a member of the Imperium (or any Pocket Empire/Client
    State), and exceeds the maximum Tech Level for the Imperium at the time
    (C for years 0-99, D for years 100-199).
 
    For an example, see Gemid (Vland 1903).

Since when has ANY news about the gaming industry, Traveller in particular,
or anything other than "D&D causes suicides" EVER appeared in USA TODAY???

I don\'t know if this is true or not, but I do know that some people need to
sound like they are "in the know" even when they have NO clue what is going
on. We have a guy like this here. Not too long ago, we had a conversation
that went something like this:

ME: "Is Champions: New Millenium in yet?"

HIM: "It isn\'t out yet. I heard it won\'t be out for three months."

ME: "Funny, people on rec.games.frp.misc are talking about it already."

HIM: "Look, I\'m in the business. I know it isn\'t out yet." (grumbling about
the "damn Internet"...I was the third person that day to tell him that it
WAS out.)

I. of course, drove the hour and 10 minutes to Lansing, MI, went to Rider\'s
Hobby Shop, and picked it up that same day. I DID take it back to him and
said "still think it isn\'t out?" I don\'t shop there anymore.

My strong suspicion is that this is merely rumor.

It can\'t be *that* bad.  In one of Steve Higginbotham\'s
PBEM campaigns I presented him a detailed plan for a
space-marines assault on one of the other Islands powers\'
asteroid habitats, including the ram-blast-and-board landing
ships with the 10-displacement-ton shaped charges built into
the bow for forcible entry.  This sort of brings the same idea
to mind, albeit on a bigger scale.

Who knows, though.  Maybe y\'all will suprise us.

	Dear Davar:

	I regret to have to inform you that the rumours have played you
false.  While the destructive potential of a black hole gun is enough to
make anyone salivate, our BHG-MP project was sadly canned at the concept
level due to some severe difficulties with recoil, quite aside from the
problems of safe ammunition storage, let alone obtaining a consistent
supply of black holes of identical caliber.

	Quite simply, our projections indicated that in order to obtain
anywhere near a respectable muzzle velocity, the recoil produced would
launch the shooter backwards at relativistic speeds.  In fact, the weapon
syste, as initially concieve, would more accurately be described as a
"Black Hole-anchored hypervelocity shooter and gun launch system".

	This problem is inherent in any weapon system where the projectile
is a ludicrously large number of orders of magnitude more massive than the
shooter and weapon system combined.  My progeny down in the design bureau
indicated that this could be palliated by the incorporation into the weapon
of a very large number of dreadnought-sized thruster plate drives with
fusion plants to match, and reduction of the muzzle velocity to a few
millimeter/minutes, provided the shooter took a long running start.
Shortly thereafter the grandchild in charge of the project determined that
creeping feature bloat was turning the weapon system from a small arm into
a super-mega-dreadnought class naval vessel many times larger than anything
built by the Imperium to date, and with heavy hearts we decided to
terminate the project.

	However, should we ever overcome the technological hurdles required
to implement such a system, I will personally ensure that the first
production unit will be coloured puce, specially for you.

		With affection,

		Henagabar.

Originally end of June, then in time for GenCon. The latest date I\'ve heard
is some time in November. Not that I\'m complaining - I would _much_ rather
that IG/Marc took their time, and got everything absolutely right than have
them rush it out and have lots of glaring errors/typos in it (again). So
far everthing looks promising...

The current T4 softcover is $11. I guess this is to clear stock, and get
people interested in T4 so that they buy T4.1. Last I saw T4.1 was going to
be a bit over $30 (they kept changing the price at one stage, but it has
been stable for the last two months or so).

BTW, if you are so inclined you can pre-order the T4.1 book. I\'ve done so.

Cheers,
Jason

Is there something about Gamestore owners?  My NFLGS\'s

Re:	Project: Concealable Light Low-Lethality Thud Gun

******************************************************************

Dear Uncle Hengie:

	I\'m sorry to report that initial feasibility studies demonstrate
that Cousin Shidaar\'s concept for a ship-based anti-Deep Meson Site mass
driver is somewhat flawed.

	To recap, Cousin Shidaar\'s concept was that of a HEAP gauss round
scaled up by several orders of magnitude; a 10m diameter by 50-odd meter
mass driver projectile, containing 2 displacement tons of liquid hydrogen
as coolant and fusion mass, was to be accelerated via a spinally mounted
mass driver to velocities exceeding 25,000 meters/second.  The projectile
was to mass approximately 58,900 tons.  The LHyd coolant, serving as
refrigerant to lower the round\'s IR signature, was to run through piping
running through the projectile and expand upon heating into a hemispherical
cavity located towards the rear of the projectile.

	Upon impact, the kinetic energy released would be on the order of a
1.4 megaton nuclear detonation.  As the slug drove through the surface of
the planet, disintegrating from the high energies released, compression
effects would compact the hydrogen into the top of the dome-shaped
detonation chamber, where the heat created by impact would ignite a fusion
explosion, focussed by the shape of the detonation chamber and tamped to a
small extent by the remaining mass and velocity of the projectile.  The
resulting explosion (of approximately 4 megatons at estimated efficiency of
<1%), when combined with the  extremely high impact velocity of the
superdense projectile, was to be sufficient enough to blast through the
planet\'s crust and destroy the targeted deep meson site.

	Had the weapon worked as projected, this would have resulted in a
means of eliminating deep meson sites from beyond their lethal radius,
while causing minimal (relatively speaking) collateral damage to the
planet; the destruction caused would have been limited relative to the
depth of the impact compared to the use of high-yield fusion devices of
comparable yield; total devastation, and climatological and other
environmental damage would have been relatively limited.

	However, after running the numbers through some preliminary models,
it is estimated that due to the extremely high energy levels involved, the
penetrative HEAP-analogue effect that Cousin Shidaar envisioned would not
occur; even superdense has its limits.  The slug would simply vapourize
before digging too deep, causing precisely the sort of widespread massive
destruction that the weapon concept was to avoid.  When following standard
crater-producing models on a typical Sylean-norm planet, it is estimated
that assuming fusion detonation took place as projected (which is far from
certain), the crater produced would be somewhat over 850 meters in diameter
and somewhat less deep.  The destructive radius of the blast would of
course be much larger, on a par with a 4.3 megaton yield thermonuclear
device.  Thus, the destructive effect of the projectile would be
insufficient to accomplish its goal of deep meson site neutralization.

	Of course, while the ability to cause this sort of damage to a
target is eminently desirable, there are far less expensive means of
causing it than Cousin Shidaar\'s outsize mass driver.  Scaling up the
projectile size and velocity would increase costs (both of weapon system
and platform) proportionately, not to mention crater size and collateral
damage.  Thus, I cannot recommend that we proceed with the development of
this weapon system until materials technology progresses to the point where
a projectile as described above would not vapourize upon impact.  This
development is unlikely in the short to medium term.

	To conclude, while his concept is fundamentally flawed, Cousin
Shidaar has nevertheless demonstrated exceptional talent for a 7-year-old,
and I would suggest that we shunt him into the extremely enriched
educational program at the creche.

	Your affectionate niece,

	Niipie.

I *would* if I thought that it would do *any* good.  Other, better people
than me have compiled errata lists of the IG products and sent them in. 
Where are they?  They certainly aren\'t on the website.

Heck, I\'ll volunteer to *fix* it, update the errata page, and give some of
my precious time to maintaining it.  All I need is two things:

1. Someone at IG to give the word.
2. A place to put it all.

Not that I believe that such an offer would be accepted...

Hmm...  Hey, Marc!  Who\'s arm do I have to twist to get a job as IG\'s

FFS2 is not that hard - just time consuming to get it right.

I also agree that the "standards" need to be published, as well as enough
components to construct and quick and dirty ship. THe problem I was
refering to was related to the current SSDS system. When ever I try and fit
the components into teh hull length give there it doesn\'t work out, so I\'ve
basically ignored them. FFS2 offers several shapes and size varients that
may rectify this.

A lot depends on *how* you make it go bang.

But the general "rule of thumb" for fusion is that .1% of the mass is
converted to energy (fission only does .01%). So .1% * .97 tonnes is
..001*970 kg is .97 kg. 

So .97*(3e8)^2 = .97*9e16 

Call it 9e16 joules.

I remember a couple of players when I first got the CT rules. They
wanted to try out the combat. They picked a *bad* example (pistol vs
submachine gun?) and I even pointed out that at the range they\'d
picked, it was medium range for the pistol and short range for the
other weapon. 

They were rather upset when the guy with the pistol wound up messily
dead in the first round. :-)

   My original thinking was that throwing a punch or swinging a sword
takes about a second, yet the TNE combat rules only allow you to strike
once (twice if you have 6+ initative) per 5 second combat turn.

   As I indicated, the rule is still experimental.  There are still a
number of issues to resolve including fighting endurance--you can only
throw so many punches before you punch yourself out, or swing your sword
so many times before your arms become so weary you can\'t pick up the
sword anymore to swing.  Limits on the number of blows you can strike in
melee would tend to slow people down to save themselves.

   Playing the engineer (usually in my games this is an NPC, so no one
is left bored) can have its moments.  For example (Nick close your eyes
and ignore this post), in my current campaign, the engineer (a PC for a
change) of the starship is so skilled at what he does, he has taught
courses on it at the Terran Republic Naval Engineering School (based in
San Francisco where the Presidio used to be--bonus points for whoever
can tell me who else uses this location).  Anyway, he does the
engineering thing now because he\'d rather be on a tramp freighter
running around than retired making money as a consultant.  Sitting on
board ship pulling guard duty one day, he stumbled upon the idea of
transjump drive.  Transjump would theoretically allow you to jump to any
star, anywhere in the Universe (the practical limit being Charted Space)
in one week.  He proceeded to begin disassembling the jump drive and
reassembling it with the proper modification to allow transjump.  Within
the next few gaming sessions, he and the crew will find out if it
actually works. <insert evil laugh here>

   Ditto.  While there may be some hedging of bets going on, I don\'t
believe that IG\'s license even has an ending date, let alone that it
would expire any time soon.

   No, Loren\'s post indicated sourcebook*s*, has in more than one.  How
many more than one isn\'t clear.

   There have indeed been assurances from Loren that his project will be
an alternative timeline, not a replacement for the original canon.

   However, and this has been pointed out by more than one thinking
person around here, *should* IG fail and no one pick up Traveller as a
independent game system, the SJG material would become canon by default.

   IMHO, I don\'t think there is anything to worry about yet.  Revisit
this rumor in six months and see if it has any more validity.

I prefer to halve PC hit capacity and double NPC hit capacity, so they\'re
fairly well matched. The quick kill rule works just fine and is definitely
a requirement for realistic play. 



And now...

***************
* A Question! *
***************

TNE Related of course, but all suggestions are welcome:

	I\'m working on some rules for constructing extra-sharp edges for
knives/swords etc... because I figured by the year 5000+ mankind must have
developed some pretty sneaky techniques for improving melee weapon
penetration. I\'m not actually going to have monomolecular weapons, but
something pretty close to it.

What I have so far:

		Melee weapons have a listed damage such as \'1d6+STR\' and
lose 2 damage \'points\' (not dice) for each level of armour on the target.
So to get a better penetration, you\'d either a) make weapons that only
lose 1 point or less per level of armour or b) increase the overall damage
of the weapon so it cuts in deeper.
		I\'m going to opt for the extra damage, to avoid changing
any combat rules or the physics of traveller :) So my rough table for
sharpness progressions goes like this:


			Xtra Sharp Edge Weaponry ...or X-SHED Weapons :)

			TL	Damage Mod	Cost Mod
			x	x1.5		x a
			x+n	x2.0		x b
			x+2n	x2.5		x c
			x+3n	x3.0		x d
			
			and so on....

			Where x is a tech level, n is the tech progression
			rate and a,b,c,d... are the cost multipliers for the corresponding level.

My questions are:

		1) What kinds of things could we do to make things
		   sharper (eg diamond tips and so on...)
		2) At what tech level should this option appear and how
		   fast should it develop?
		3) How much is this going to bump up the price of the
		   weapon (obviously based on area being sharpened)?
		4) Is there some way that these weapons could be dulled
		   and sharpened through some sort of artificial
		   manipulation at higher tech levels to avoid some nasty
		   cuts?

Semo has pretty much quashed the "SJG Owns Traveller Now" rumor being spread
by this game shop chappie, but added a speculation of his own that there will
be only one product.

From the SJG Press Release Dated September 4, 1997

"Long-time Traveller editor and writer Loren Wiseman will serve as
Line Editor for the GURPS Traveller series of books and will write the
first release." Emphasis mine.

Please take careful note of the phrases "Line Editor" and "series of books"

I leave the task of drawing conclusions from this short quote as an
intellectual exercise

Anyone know of anything more destructive than plastic-explosive that could
be packed into a dice-sized conical explosive charge?
 
(If anyone\'s wondering why, I\'m trying to design the Hardsuits from
Bubblegum Crisis :) I\'d rate them at about TL-17 technology according to
what I can patch together using FF&S).

Some minor problems with your math.

1.5 billion * 36 = 54 billion people, not 540 billion as you state.

Now, based on that we have:

Cr500 (which I think is too high to begin with) for a naval tax (this is over
1/10th of the average persons budget according to the Traveller Book [CT]) x
54 billion = 2.7 trillion.

1/1000th of 2.7 trillion is 27 billion.

Now we have 27 billion credits per 36 worlds, that\'s enough for 122 patrol
cruisers, or 27 Kinunirs, or 93 close escorts per year.  Now, this is not
including maintenance costs on these craft (including serious repairs, after
all they will be *fighting pirates*), salaries per craft (all CT figures), or
salaries for ship\'s troops (wouldn\'t it be embarassing for a Kinunir to be
boarded and taken over by a small team of pirates?), or salaries for
coordinating and command peoples, or costs for life support (hefty using our
CT model here), costs for sensor stations, etc. etc.  All these things add up
in a big way.  Then of course you have to pay the families of those who are
killed in combat.

And, how about the lawsuits when an anti-piracy craft fires upon the wrong
ship and kills little Billy Jenkins, the cabin boy.

Important question:  Is the cost of fighting off Vargr Corsairs in places
like the Corridor sector subsumed in this 1/1000th of the naval budget?  If
so, I\'m sure more ships and lives get lost out there, and hence more ships
must be moved to these locations.

All this stuff adds up after awhile.  Of course, as I said, I think your
Cr500 per person figure is awfully high.  Traveller rules say the average
person has to spend Cr400 a month for food and lodging.  Cr500 is a little
over 10%.  And that\'s just for the Imperial Navy!!!  How about the Scout
service (tons of ships, facilities, and the X-Boats)??  The Imperial
bureaucracy?  Etc. etc.

Where are you digging up these figures here?  I\'m a little confused.  Around
Cr105 per person for system defense (I divided your figure by 50,000,000, the
midrange for a pop 7 world).  

Okay, I\'ll bite.  Now, you have salaries, life support, maintenance (again,
they\'re fighting pirates so this\'ll be higher than usual), coordinating and
command peoples, sensors, sensors, and more sensors.  Plus, they\'ll probably
have to try and stop smugglers as well.  They have to pay for all of these
"hidden" spaceports where the SDBs refuel...  Now, 5,250 MCr can buy you _5_
Kinunir Class ships or _24_ Patrol Cruisers, not 50 or 200+ respectively.
Since they are also charged with local defense, they have to have SDBs too,
they can buy _21_ of them.  This goes down by a factor of 10 each time you go
down a population level.  A pop 6 world can buy .5 kinunir class ships, or
2.4 patrol cruisers, or 2 SDBs, a pop 5 world can buy .05 kinunir class
ships, .24 patrol cruisers, or 2 SDBs.  A pop 4 world could pay for the
_maintenance_ of 5 Kinunirs, 24 patrol cruisers, or 20 SDBs.  A pop 3 world
couldn\'t even maintain a single Kinunir each year!

Now, here\'s the bombshell:  The average world size is, according to the dice
throws, 5.  Hardly the unstoppable juggernaut you claim.

All in all, I think your taxes are way too high (the average person\'s cost of
living is Cr400 a month, for naval forces [imperial and system-wide] alone
1.5 months goes out the door).  That is to say 12.5 percent of someone\'s
total cost of living goes to taxes that build and maintain space/starcraft
etc.  That\'s probably about 1/3 of the total taxes an individual pays.  And
that\'s assuming the average cost of living is truly the average cost of
living.  After all, there are alot more poor people on this planet than
middle class or rich people.

I dunno, your numbers are way too high.  When I get the time, I\'ll puzzle it
out further.  For now I am unconvinced by your numbers, especially since you
seem to be off on your own math...

*sigh* First Roderick, now you.  What\'s with this list, anyway?  I picture
us all standing at the window of a liner in orbit around, say, Regina...a
pleasant, lovely, earth-like world...as our guide describes in reverent
tones all that goes to make such a world: the planetessimals merging
around a young T-Tauri star; the complex exchanges of mass, energy, and
angular momentum; the differentiation of core from mantle; the slow
cooling and solifification of the crust; the long, patient march of life
from unicellular algae to complex, unique, irreplaceable forms, modifying
the atmosphere, leaving its unmistakeable stamp even on the
lithosphere...and then our guide pauses for questions.

Roderick:  Umm, what would it take to blast entirely through the crust?
           Roughly, I mean.

Martin:    Or how \'bout to split it into two chunks?!

Roderick:  Yeah, or a bazillion chunks!

Martin:    Woo hoo!  Or glowing vapor receding at .5 c!

It\'s an odd thing when the much-touted Sense of Wonder relies so heavily
on Blowing Things Up Real Good. :)

Now, to business:  "Cracking an earth-like planet in two" is a bit
ambiguous.  If you mean literally splitting it into two pieces not
gravitationally bound to one another, then plate tectonics don\'t matter at
*all*...they only effect the crust, which contains so little of the
planet\'s mass that it can be entirely neglected.

The easiest way to model what you\'re looking for is to figure out what it
would take to accelerate the entire mass of the Earth to its own escape
velocity (cf. Greg Bear\'s _The Forge of God_, which I *highly* recommend
on this topic, and as a generally Good Read -- though he also messes with
tectonics, which I consider a scientific flaw tossed in because it\'s so
damn cool). 

So, earth\'s escape velocity is about 1e4 m/s, and its mass is roughly 6e24
kg.  So, getting the whole planet up to its own escape velocity would take

  KE = 1/2 MV^2 = 0.5 * 6e24 kg * 1e8 m2/s2
                = 3e32 J

....or three hundred trillion trillion megajoules (American trillions,
10e12). 

Anything less than that, and even if you succeed in splitting it into
chunks, most of the pieces will just fall together into one (jumbled up,
*thoroughly* trashed) planet again, like Uranus\' moon Miranda did after it
got walloped not-quite-hard-enough. 

Hope this helps...and *don\'t* try this at home! :)

Is a \'pace\' defined as two steps, as in successive plantings of (say) the
right foot?  Otherwise this implies a stride length of more than 5 feet...

In Traveller history you see that when fleets meet, they generally

(at least a fair portion of the time) and jump disrupters are
generally only available on larger ships.  However, we don\'t see
smaller forces being that much harder to ambush.  For that reason,
I assume that energy releases disrupt the ability to jump in

Sort of.

FF&S2 has surface area multipliers and height:width:length 
proportions for all of its hull types.  Some (like box 
configurations) have several sets of proportions.  Others don\'t, and 
this includes wedges.

That\'s not to say that one couldn\'t create different hull shapes and 
proportions -- I have -- but you do then have to work out the 
modifiers for surface area, height, length and width compared to a 
sphere of the same volume.  Area and length are important parameters 
in FF&S design.

There\'s also the touchy issue of people saying "TNAS doesn\'t match

mass-driver armed ships?
One of our players insists he\'s seen a reference, but can\'t remember where.

Now, with a mass driver weapon, perhaps it might be possible to project a
series of Discarding Sabot armour-piercing-type projectiles (rather small -
say a few dozen kgs) at your deep site meson gun. Arriving in a fast burst
(compensated for planetary movement), these superdense penetrators would
crack the surface rock, set up seismic shocks etc. It should be possible to
\'drill\' through to the deep site by repeated impacts (in fact the
superheating effect of the impacts should vaporise some of the rock and
soil, thus allowing deeper penetration by the next projectile.) It should
thus be feasable to drill out the deep site with relatively little
cratering and thus damage to local real estate values - from outside Meson
range, too, so long as the targeting computer can correct for drift.
Accurate shooting from several AU is theoretically possible, although
targets in the Andromeda galaxy remain, for now, beyond accurate range.
 


(a 100kg projectile moving at, say 100,000 metres per second, carries 50 X
100000 X 100000 = 5 e 11 joules. Enough to knock down 13,888,888,889
standing people according to theoretical extrapolation of research. Field
test results on effect what this energy would have on a planet are not yet
available.) 


However, there is a second application, of interest to industry. A mining
ship fitted with such a weapon should theoretically be able to target plate
boundaries, drill them open, then apply heavier projectiles (heavier not
for greater energy - velocity is the king of energy - but for energy
transfer, ie an effect similar to a dumdum rather than an armour piercing
round.) These heavier projectiles, applied with precise timing, should
cause the plates to move, allowing a final projectile (massive) to be
applied to the core of the world. The \'splash effect\', should crack or
break the planet into conveniently-mined asteroids, and give access to the
vast mass of  iron, radioactives and such currently untappable within the
inconveniently large planetary masses found in local space. Any asteroids
of diameter too large for mining can be moved to collision orbits for size
reduction, or cut with the above superdense \'drilling\' projectiles.

Patent on both systems is pending. Infringement may result in field testing.

It\'s not the gravity field that causes the trouble. If it was, the jump
limits would work differently. It\'s gotta be the *rate of change* of
the gravity field (ie tidal forces).

So a tractor won\'t work, because it\'s a *uniform* field.

The trouble is getting it to *stay* cracked. Everything deeper than a
few miles is *fluid*.

Somebody on rec.arts.sf.science figured how much energy it\'d take to
break the Earth in two, and give the two pieces escape velocity
relative to each other (so they\'d stay "cracked").

I can\'t find the figures for that one (try Dejanews), but to
*completely* disrupt the planet (ie give every atom escape velocity)
takes about a week\'s output from the sun.

	Hm.  Don\'t know.  Don\'t use T4 damage and armour value numbers; I
don\'tthink they scale up properly.  However, here\'s the info, lifted from
the sci.space. FAQ, that I used to get the cratering numbers on that
anti-deep-meson site thingie that I posted last night.  Leonard Erickson
very kindly sent it to me.

	Boy was I ever disappointed by the yield; only 4.3 megatons.

	As far as completely trashing planets goes, Greg Bear\'s Anvil of
Stars had a cute idea; while hordes of self-replicating nanobots are busy
deep in the oceans building large fusion devices along the rift valleys
between tectonic plates (and we\'re talking _large_ here; the oxygen left
over from cracking the hydrogen out of the water caused noticeable
increases in oxygen levels worldwide), you drop a lump of neutronium into
the planet on one side, and a lump of _anti_-neutronium in the other.  They
sink through the planet towards the center of gravity, being far, far
denser and more massive than the intervening rock, and when they meet at
the core, they go boom.  You then trigger the nukes along the tectonic
plates to split them open, and you get lovely things like continental
plates flipping about like pancakes (well, not quite, but in the novel this
process definetely did Earth in).

One way to handle it is to consider the weapon to have a high ROF.  
If the normal laser pulse is 0.01 seconds long, you have 100 \'pulses\' 
per second, and a ROF of 500 (5x100).  The penetration will only 
increase if the target obliges by standing still long enough.

A couple of problems, however.  In order to get that high a ROF, the 
focal array has to be beefed up substantially (an FA multiplier of 
2000).  Also, your 0.01 MJ laser (typical for a laser pistol) now 
requires a 1 MW power input.

Nitpick: the homopolar generator is not a battery (in the sense of
long-term power storage) - it\'s acting as a capacitor since the
battery does not have the power output needed to power the laser pulse
directly.

Our own experience was that by teaming up with our local shop (Karl & Keith

to sell quite a bit of T4 stuff at Euro GEN CON (through the BITS stand and
the Marquee Models stall), much of it to new people as well as current T4

Jon of Maidstone Games was kind enough to spend several days of the
convention helping us at our stand simply because we\'d made the effort to
help run demos when he opened his shop earlier this year. He\'s trying to be
known as a Traveller \'specialist\', stocking everything from the T4 range
down to our lowly BITS Scout badges and 101 books.

So, in summary, there\'s still life in the old dog/horse/cat yet, certainly

Ouch! You are quite right, and I bow my head in shame. I should have caught 
that one. I did doublecheck my figures, but... :-(

>Cr500 (which I think is too high to begin with) for a naval tax (this is over

>54 billion = 2.7 trillion.

54,000,000,000*500 = 27,000,000,000,000. You\'ve made the same mistake I did,
only you made it the other way. Let\'s split the difference: 27 trillion.
However, since the credits of low and medium tech worlds are worth less
I would like to play it safe and go for 2/3rds of this figure, or 18 trillion.
 
The Cr500/person is straight out of _Trillion Credit Squadron_. It is also
equal to 5% of the average person\'s yearly income. (This figure, Cr10,000
per person on the average was something I calculated based on the monthly
expenses quoted in CT; with the publication of _Pocket Empires_ it also
became canon (Yay! ;-))
 
> Now we have 27 billion credits per 36 worlds, 

180 billion.

>that\'s enough for 122 patrol cruisers, or 27 Kinunirs, or 93 close escorts 
>per year.  

The Imperium dosen\'t throw away their ships each year and buy a new set, you
know. According to _Trillion Credit Squadron_ a fleet is equivalent to 10
times it\'s yearly budget. Maintenance of a ship costs 10% of its initial
purchase price annually.

>Now, this is not including maintenance costs on these craft (including

The 10% includes _everything_ except repairs and replacenment of combat
losses. It includes all personnel costs, from recruitment posters to
pensions, all logistics support, all routine maintenance and replacement
of non-combat losses (Ie. retirement of worn-out ships). This isn\'t just
an opinion, it\'s a rule! ;-).

>And, how about the lawsuits when an anti-piracy craft fires upon the wrong
>ship and kills little Billy Jenkins, the cabin boy.

Since piracy is so impossible as it is, the number of times a patrol ship
would actually get in a fight is excessively low, and the chance that they
will fire on a friendly ship is negligible.

It\'s true that the Corridor Fleet has more than it\'s share of the Naval
Budget, but by the same token the subsectors deep inside Imperial territory
will have correspondingly less. The remaining 999/1000th will be quite able
to handle anything the Vargr corsairs can throw at them. Though now that
you have pointed out my factor 10 mistake I may have to back down and ask
for a second 1/1000th of the budget. Or not; I haven\'t gone over the new
figures.
 
>Of course, as I said, I think your Cr500 per person figure is awfully high. 
>Traveller rules say the average person has to spend Cr400 a month for food 
>and lodging.  Cr500 is a little over 10%.  

I don\'t know about you, but I use more money than just for my food and rent.
So I would add 50% to that figure for other expenses. That\'s Cr600 per month
or Cr7,200 per year. Then I assume that people pay 25% in taxes on the
average (Note: According to _Pocket Empires_ this is on the low end of the
scale for taxes). That gives an average income of Cr9,600 which I rounded
up to Cr10,000. @5% taxes gives you Cr2500 per person of which 20% goes to
defense. Now, that isn\'t so unreasonable, is it?

>And that\'s just for the Imperial Navy!!!  How about the Scout service (tons 
>of ships, facilities, and the X-Boats)??  The Imperial bureaucracy?  Etc. 
>etc.

That is the figure according to _TCS_. IMO the Army, Scouts and Marines
would come out of the naval taxes too, but there\'s no rule to say they
do (Unless you count _Striker_ which does specifically include the Army,
but do the tax calculations in a way that varies from 1/3rd of the Cr500
to 5 times the Cr500). The X-boats presumably makes a profit. The Imperial
bureaucracy must be paid for either out of the Emperor\'s stock portfolio 
or out of some further taxes (after all, we have taxes to the tune of 
Cr2000 per person unaccounted for).

I used 15,000,000 as the population of the average pop 7 planet. As you point
out that is propably 3 times to little, but I\'ve been trying to err on the
side of caution (except for that embarrassing factor 10 mistake ;-).

Correction. They are not fighting pirates because pirates wouldn\'t be able
to survive in this environment, so there won\'t be any to fight.

>Now, 5,250 MCr can buy you _5_ Kinunir Class ships or _24_ Patrol Cruisers,

But it can maintain 50 and 200+ respectively.

>Since they are also charged with local defense, they have to have SDBs too,

No no, an SDB is just a non-jump capable patrol ship (or cruiser or battle-
ship, depending on size). I\'m talking about the _equivalent_ of 50 Kinunirs
or 200+ patrol ships. For one world that may be 200 SDBs, for another it may
be 3 30,000 T cruisers. The main point is that a pirate would be made to
attack them (and shortly afterwards he would be dead).

That\'s not much of a bombshell considering that I carefully accounted for
that by using 36 worlds for my example and even spelled out how may of each
population level there was.
 
>I dunno, your numbers are way too high.

Not according to either _TCS_ or _PE_. And I can\'t say that I feel that 25%
taxes of which 1/5th goes to defense fails the reality check either. But
then, I live in a country where taxes averages 30%, with 60% not uncommon
for the upper income levels.

>When I get the time, I\'ll puzzle it out further.  For now I am unconvinced
by your numbers, especially since you seem to be off on your own math...

Yes, that\'s was a bad mistake, wasn\'t it? Off by a factor 10! Unforgivable, 
don\'t you think? I hang my head in shame.

Very good, very good indeed. 3G3 is better, but the product has been good
all along.

Email me privately if you want the conversion info for T4...better
yet...check out the web site and get the Excel spreadsheet package

No, but then it isn\'t piracy anymore. Then its warfare. I never claimed that

An SDB is merely a non-jump-capable starship. There is no reason why you
can\'t use jump-capable ships for system defense. Assuming that the cost of
the non-jump part of a warship is MCr0.85/T (a figure I got by calculating
the averages of 10 cruisers and battleships in _Fighting Ships_), you get
about 90% bang for your buck (or clout for your credit, as an Imperial
would put it) if you buy jump-1 ships down to 50% c-f-c if you buy jump-6
ships. So if you have to garrisson a neighboring system you could use
jump-1 ships that can jump back to get serviced and rotate them (That 
would have the added advantage that your ships can run away if the Zhodani
shows up in force). Or you could have a tender ferry SDBs back and forth,
which would work out even cheaper. You\'d need 13 ships to have 12 ships 
stationed in that system all the time. Not a massive drop in efficiency.

8 Tigresses would cost 2.9 trillion credits. 8 Plankwells would cost 0.96
trillion credits, which means that one billion people can support 1 BatRon
of Tigresses, a BatRon of Plankwells and 4 BatRons of 50,000 T cruisers 
and still have enough left over for 240 Kinunirs. And the average Imperial
planet in 1100 has 1.5 billion people.

Agreed. And the standard Corsair is supposed to be, what, 400 T?

I like to stay within canon too, but I make one proviso: viz. that canon
makes sense. As far as I am concerned Marc Miller himself can claim that
there is an unavoidable 1 in 36 chance of misjump per jump and I still
wouldn\'t accept it.

The money used to buy the ships are taxed from people in the same system.
There is no influx of credit there. Any influx of credit comes from those
C, D, and E systems that buy ships from you.

Yes, but all they do is produce warships. You can\'t eat ships, you can\'t burn
them, you can\'t cuddle them and they can\'t cut your hair. As far as the 
living standard of the people on the planet is concerned, anything used on a 
warship is merely wealth poured into space. As long as you don\'t count the 
savings from not being plundered or conquered, of course. A warship is as
much a drain on the economy as a policeman is. He eats, he drinks, he takes
up space, he uses up bullets and wears out uniforms, and he dosen\'t produce 
one solitary bit of wealth.

All that is besides the point since I\'m claiming that (a tiny part of) the
ships built on Class A worlds will be used to defend all those C, D, and E
worlds.

Surely not. A jump-1 ship uses 12% for engines+fuel, so a non-jump
freighter will have 14% the capacity of a jump-1 freighter. Still a
significant difference, I admit.
 
>You have made many good points.  I think the core of our disagreement lays

I don\'t want to use capital ships for anti-piracy work, I just think that
any capital ship will have a chilling effect, to put it mildly, on pirate
activity in those systems where they are stationed.

>...the number of small ships available to any system,

That\'s the real rub, of course. To repeat what I said in another posting:
I\'m not saying that it dosen\'t take considerable assets to prevent piracy, 
just that it takes considerably less than what is available. And I\'m
prepared to back up that opinion with figures (Sometimes they will be off
by a factor 10, but, hey, that\'s why I post them: so that I can get them
corrected ;-)

>and the access that \'C\', \'D\' and \'E\' systems will have to these ships.

They don\'t need any access at all the way you mean. All the need is 
membership in the Imperium (or just an alliance with a high-population
world with an A starport).

Yes and no. If you want to wage war and can afford to pay the bills and
can keep your base secret, then it any competent captain can manage to
avoid combat with Imperial forces. But unless you have the wealth to
fund something the size of an Imperial Squadron, there\'s not much you
can do with your "pirate" ships. If you can afford a BCr squadron, then
you can do some good (or rather, bad), but the 400 T Corsair would have
either the life expectancy or the success of a 19th Century Mexican
border gang in 1997.

If I was funding a terrorist campaign against the Imperium then I think
I could think of better ways to spend my money.

 An expanded, more versatile QSDS-like system is good, but only if it
maintains the same backwards compatibility with FFS2 that QSDS has with
FF&S.  Introducing a new system which is incompatible with the previously
published ones would simply repeat the same mistake made with Bk 2 / HG in
Classic Traveller...

Rod, you\'re beginning to scare me a lot...

According to my handy 5th edition of _College Physics_ Sears Zemansky and
Young, the energy produced by a proton-proton fusion reaction (4H -> 1 He)
is 25.7 MeV.

970 kg of H2 is 485,000 moles of H2. Multiply this times Avogadro\'s number
(6.02e23) to get 2.92e29 molecules H2. Divide by 2 (to get the needed four
protons) you get 1.46e29. Multiply that times 25.7 you get 3.75e36 eV.
times 1.602E-19 Joules you get 6.01e17 joules, or one _hell_ of a bang!

6.01e11 Mj...yeeesh! That\'s a planetbuster all right! 

NOW Jory\'s gonna ask how we can put this into a hand grenade ;-)

How about, any penetrating (thrusting weapons, bullets) damage above 0.5
target strength (represents muscle mass) is doubled. For cutting, any damage
above target strength is doubled. For blunt, damage is never doubled. For
flame based weapons (energy weapons etc,) any damage above 0.5 con is
doubled

I remeber these things from MT, large weapons, very high tech

I also remember the Man Portable version, although they were not in Trav, 
but might be in the Future with GURPS-Trav (but ghods i hope not! <G>)

Ever hear of the tachyonic shotgun?

Why?  Just because he wants to make a planet-buster and end his civilized
universe.

OK, maybe I\'m making a few leaps in logic here, but...  If it is possible to
destroy planets, and somebody gets the tech, somebody else will steal it from
them.  If there\'s a war, they\'ll each end up using the planet busters on each
other.  The "winner" will have few enough resources left (because their planets
got toasted) that they can\'t hold up to another agressor and will have to use
the planet-busters as deterrant.  Which will work until someone steals the
tech again.  Continue until you don\'t have enough planets left.  It may take a
while, but eventually you _will_ run out of planets.  Anybody want to try
building an entirely spacegoing civilization?

Just hope Virus doesn\'t come up with one.

It\'s a mini-campaign of four adventures for MegaTraveller that appeared in
The Travellers\' Digest issues 14-17.

It\'s set in the Spinward Marches ca. 1118 and deals with a psionic noble
order that was suppressed during the Psionic Suppressions, but not entirely
eliminated. The order then split up in a \'good\' order called the Order of
the White Star and a \'bad\' one called the Order of the Red Star. The player
characters get involved with White Star through a series of quite
interesting adventures.

The campaign stops after four adventures, but with plenty of room for more
adventures. I\'m currently playing a campaign based on these adventures,
although the actual adventures are far behind. We had great fun with them,
and still have with the current campaign.

Quite good, if you can get them.

Whoops, in the wee hours of the morning I in fact made a mistake in my own
math.  Cr500*54 billion citizens = 2.7x10^13 power, OR 27 trillion, not 2.7
trillion as I erroneously stated.  My apologies for any confusion created.
The rest of my math should check out fine though.

Gad...  How did I make such a mistake, and then repeat it with "1/1000th of
2.7 trillion is 27 billion."

Okay, I\'ll bite. Can\'t you vary the field strength of a tractor? Scale it
up and down? Or better yet, focus it on just a small portion of the target
vessel? I\'m sure that the latter, at least, would generate some tidal
forces.

 welcome (bracing myslef and taking out fire insurance... :).

 \'Conestoga\' Class Merchant/Transport
 
 Based on the wagon trains used to move settlers to the American West.
 
 - Dual purpose starship. 1) Transportation of colonists bound for the Wilds
   (as    low-berth corpecicles?) and the material needed for establishing a
   foothold on a new world. 2) Once destination is reached these starships can 
   then be converted to various other uses by the fledgling colony (nucleus of
   system Navy, in system transport of raw materials, Merchant Marine, etc.)

 
 \'Handcart\' Class Transport 

 A variant of the \'Conestoga\' class of starship, this type of ship is based
 on the   handcarts used by secondary Mormon colonists bound for Utah.

 - A cheap, \'one-shot\' starship used to move colonists (but not material) to
   newly settled systems. Upon arrival in target system, these starships are
   designed to be dismantled and the components used in the building  of 
   self-sufficient homesteads for the new arrivals.


 \'Tramp Belter\' Class Starship 

 We have \'Tramp Merchant\' starships in Traveller, why not \'Tramp Belter\' 
 starships?

 - These ships should meet the following requirements. 1) Jump capable - able 
   to set off for that new \'gold rush\' five parsecs distant. 2) Living quarters 
   for Belter/Prospector and family if any (i.e. mining camp/tent city type of 
   accomodations - cramped and uncomfortable, but that doesn\'t matter because 
   any sacrifice is worth it...afterall, that \'big strike\' is always just
around 
   the corner.) <<I know this mindset - my father was born in a tent beside
a    
   stream located in a mining camp in the Rockies.>> 3) Small foundry for  
   processing ores. 4) "Mule" class gig or shuttle for use in hauling
supplies       in-system, and actual prospecting amongst the asteriods
(afterall - you hardly 
   want to park your Starship/home in the denser areas of an asteriod field). 
   5) Hauling individual (or a small number of) \'rocks\' or samples back to 
   starship for processing (both ore samples taken from asteriods and meteor 
   fragments for fuel extraction). 6) Extremely sensitive sensors for use in 
   prospecting likely areas of an asteroid field (or moon). 7) Beacon/markers 
   used to \'stake-out\' a claim/rock. 

 That\'s all the requirements I can think off off-hand, but I\'m sure there
are some 
 I  am overlooking and welcome suggestions.


 Lastly - a concept blatently swiped from the "FTL 2448" SF-RPG that I think would 
 fit nicely into the Traveller Universe and would make for an interseting Thudd 
 design contest. 

 - To quote: "Towed in modular sections and assembled, the Alvarez High Port became 
   a success that was licensed or purchased by most worlds that could afford
a real    port. With 24 ship bays and 46 shuttle/office bays, as well as
shore-leave    facilities, it has become a status symbol for corporations."

 - I think this type of pre-fab modular approach to a small High Port would be 
   ideal for a number of situations. Some of these might be: 1) Smaller
worlds not    capable (or wealthy enough) to build one from scratch. 2) A
hub for Belt mining    operations (supply depot, ore trans-shipping,
recreation facilities for those    lonesome Belters, corporate offices for a
Belt mining corporation, etc.). 3) A 
   hub for Gas-giant fuel skimming operations (fuel purification plant, fuel
depot 
   or fueling station for Merchant starships, living quarters/base for the Fuel 
   Skimmers, etc.). 4) A nexus Space Station/transit point for the moons of a 
   Jovian planet (similar to the Sean Connery movie in which he plays a
Marshal on 
   an Io based mining camp. The assassins he battles arrive via shuttle from
just 
   such a High Port).

 Well, that\'s it for now. I hope this sparks interest in using these ideas
as possible  future Thudd designs.

First some background: I have been an avid Traveller player, collector
and ref for the past 18 years.  And I do not have access to my books
right now, as I am on the road. :( This makes it difficult to do
research in any way.

I am in the process of starting a new group in the Massilia Sector. I
have set up the background of the 3I, the history and some of the
rumors, etc. for the players. The secret of the Ancients is going to be
the long term pull that will get the group to the Spinward Marches=85
eventually.  In the mean time they will be chasing a red herring about
the lost human homeworld and that some humans may be the Ancients.=20

The cast will be a tough group of troubleshooters for the local 3I rep
(as well as doing some miscellaneous odd jobs) starting around the year
50. If I remember that is a very interesting point in time. Ex scouts
and military, with lots of guns. They want a real paramilitary style of
play. (Humph, better be careful what they ask for with Traveller!)=20

Now for the questions, and a request for ideas and suggestions:=20
As they head towards Earth I need to come up with a few reasons why the
3I has not pushed more into Massilia any more then 10% (according to M0)
by the year 50.  What is holding them back? I know the Geonee (soon to
be mistaken for the Ancients) are in *one* subsector, but what about the
rest?  By the year 50 or so the 3I has already reached the Zhodani!

If it is an empire, what type, how strong and when do they become
absorbed into 3I? Or is it just a lack of population, and I should go
through the sector data and remove most of the worlds population and
create a vast barren zone? What does everyone think?

Is there any new system data on Massilia? I do not agree with the FS
data, too many high tech, high pop/very-low pop systems. It does not
make any sense to me, so I am looking at having to redo all of the
systems one at a time. Unless someone has a better way??!!

What background source data exist for the Massilia sector. I pulled the
Knightfall adventure before I left, but are there any other sources for
information? Old Challenge, JTAS, etc?

Any suggestions for some types of adventures. Some of the old judges
guild stuff will work in concept. (I like the idea of scouting a system,
and then returning and finding something different!) =20


Once again, thank you all for any response. If anyone is interested, I
will post a update once and awhile.  The ones I have read were very
enjoyable.=20

I\'m afraid 20th-century technology has already beaten you to it. Twice.

First, we have The Sharpest Possible Blade (tm), which is made from
ordinary, boring glass, volcanic or synthetic, it doesn\'t matter.
These blades taper to the width of a single atom at their edges, which
degree of sharpness I trust you will agree cannot be exceeded with
normal matter. They aren\'t the most durable things in the world, but
they are as sharp as it gets.  To do better, you would have to switch
to clarke-magical force fields or something.

(We also have monomolecular technology in the form of mono-crystalline
metals. They probably wouldn\'t be much sharper than ordinary metals,
this being a forging technique rather than a question of alloys, but
they do hold an edge longer and better than the same alloys do when
conventionally forged.)

Penetration, on the other hand, is another matter. They way we handle
this now seems basically to involve reducing friction between the
blade and whatever you\'re trying to penetrate. Sliding the blade along
the cut speeds penetration, and I believe this has to do with
overcoming static friction. Once you\'ve done this by sliding the
blade, the force applied directly to penetration doesn\'t have to, and
penetration is improved. Serration seems to be similar, but the
mechanism is less clear to me.

(I know, pretty boring so far. Hang on.)

The other way we handle the friction/penetration problem is
lubrication.  Remember cop-killer bullets?  The teflon coating over
the hard brass slug reduces friction between the slug and the
target. In the case of Kevlar armor, this means that instead of
snagging a bullet-sized patch of the cloth to elastically absorb the
impact, the cloth stretches across the slippery surface of the
bullet. The point of contact get smaller and smaller in terms of how
much cloth is touching the slug, so fewer fibers have to fail for the
slug to get through. The bullet penetrates much more efficiently for
its size/mass/speed.

So what does this mean for me, the consumer? 

You could try high-tech lubricants on your blade, either materially or
with some sort of friction-reducing field. You could also try
vibrating the blade rapidly, an old standby.

Here\'s a sneaky idea. Let your actual blade be dull as toast, but coat
it with gazillions of nano-machines that act like power shovels, or
like stainless-steel versions of the cilia in your lungs. When the
blade touches a target, the nano-machines start digging/sweeping/
whatever, and your blade literaly burrows into the target. If you
don\'t have an answer for your question number 4, your blade will
always cleave anything it touches in twain, no questions asked, unless
the power runs out. Ouch.

I should think this would be pretty expensive.

By the way, note once again that the THUDDD will now be operating on a

And hurt my rib cage. I haven\'t laughed so hard for a long while....

But Craig, you misunderstand. Exploring the destructive limits of
technology is not mere childish \'Blowing Things Up Real Good\' (though BTURG
is fun, too) - our exploration into the annihilatory extremes of harsh,
beautiful physics is an art. THE art. Cannot you appreciate the
counterpoint, the soul-baring moment one faces when a world, a thing of
ancient beauty, formed from chaos by the inexorable forces of physics, is
returned to a state of utter chaos by the utmost application of that
physics? A complete circle, symbolising the fragility of our being, and so
much more. That moment when an ancient world is blasted into the middle of
next week by the very life forms which took so long to grow and evolve
there... the symbolism of \'growing up\' of a species when they destroy the
planet which gave them life, now that they no longer need to be tied to
earthly things and can leave the parent.... ramble... mutter....

Actaully what I really wanted to know was: Howe much energy must I deliver
to convert an Earth-type planet into convenient chunks so that my asteroid
mining ship can strip them of their mineral wealth - think of all that iron
in the core! I think I know now. Thanks.

And thanks for a good laugh. 
Now maybe I\'ll write something thoughtful about bunnies.

An interesting diversion on the skill debate.

I was feeling a bit bored, so I put together a program which determined the
number of times a given skill slot in chargen is hit, given that there is
an equal probability of hitting each of the 36 skill slots.  Note that a
stat increase fits in a skill slot, like any other thing rolled on the
skill table.

Scroll below the conclusions to see the tables that justify them.  Or just
scroll down to admire them - I am fairly proud.

Conclusions:

We have to decide how Traveller values skill levels.  I am going to assume
that they feel someone should be competent after three terms or so.  This
is enough time to gather a doctorate and reach a decent scholar rank, or
enough time to have significant experience in an industrial job.  Since
this is only thirty, the experts and wizards of the trades are going to be
in their 40s or 50s, but those people may well not be substantially more
skilled, as they are fairly likely to have changed professions somewhere
around this time.  Further, they are going to be spending more time
fighting off aging by spending skill gains on stat increases, to the extent
they have any control over the matter.  Current character generation does
not address this issue, so neither did the simulations I ran.

This is not an issue that can easily be ignored - in TLWH, characters
regularly encounter people with skill levels of six and seven, and it has
been proposed that broker should count for half as much as under CT.  In
order to evaluate that, you need to know just how many Broker-4s and
Watercraft 7s there are out there.

From a quick perusal of the skill charts, it looks like most professions
tend to have a given skill on the charts two or three times, with the vast
majority of professions having the primary skills of the profession on the
tables twice.  Entertainers are the significant exception, in that they
have the primary skill on the tables four times.  What does this mean?

Well, if a character is around thirty, so three terms, they will have their
birth skills, plus another 15 skill levels .  We would expect that of the
thirty six skill slots a given profession has, that 23 of them were never
hit.  We would also expect that 10 were hit once, and two hit twice.
Roughly a quarter of all characters encountered would have a skill slot hit
three times.  This means that a thirty year old character with a skill
level of seven in a skill that is on the charts once is pretty darned
unlikely.

Assume that the skill in question is a primary skill, so that it is on the
charts twice.  If all skills were on the tables twice, then 48 percent of
them would never be hit, 32 percent would be hit once, 15 twice, and 4
three times.  About one percent of the time, such doubled skills would be
hit four times.

At first look, this does not seem helpful, since the tables are a mix of
skill that are on table once and twice, but one can use the numbers anyway
as a guide, since the two groups exactly overlap.  If a skill is on the
tables twice, then there is roughly a 48% chance that it will be at level
zero, 32 % at level one, and only a 1 percent chance that it will be a
level four.

From this, we must conclude that level seven and eight skills are just not
going to happen to normal characters.

Now lets see what the high end looks like - after twenty years in the
service, a five term veteran will have 25 skill levels, plus service
automatic skills and inborn skills.  This means that 38 year olds are going
to have only one quarter of the PRIMARY skills possible on the charts are
going to be at a level zero, about a third at level one, a quarter at level
2,  and 11%, 4% and 1% at 3, 4, and 5.

The less important skills that appear on the table once?  Those break down
as 50% at 0, 35 at one, 12 at 2, and 3 at 3.

So, how should we interpret this?  I would assume that a twenty year
veteran is going to be about the image of competence in the Traveller
world, and this person is going to have skills around 1-2 for almost
everything.  Given that professions give automatic additions to the most
critical skill, a player should expect twenty year veterans to have a 2-3
in a primary skill, unless they are unusual.  further, they should likely
expect this twenty year vet to have a single skill at three from the rolled
tables among the non-primary skills, or perhaps two if the table is heavy
in primary skills.

So far, I was fairly surprised and relieved.  I expected the vastly
increased receipt of skills to produce much higher levels.  Instead, it
produced characters who knew a lot more lower level skills than in previous
games, but nearly as many more fours and fives as I first expected.

I then looked at entertainers who can get performance four times on the
charts.  This leads to skill levels of five being somewhat common, and a
nonzero chance of getting to an eight.  This is enough higher than other
professions that I decided to replace half of the performance skill picks
with some kind of interpersonal skill, to be decided later.

Finally, I looked at the range.  While the variance was reduced by raising
the number of picks, so there are not going to be many people with skill
levels above four or five, the range is disturbingly high.  For the skills
on the tables twice, you have a noticeable number of skill level 8 folk
running around.  This might be acceptable, but it seems against the idea
that the range is fairly narrow.

The lesson for me was that for any profession, primary skills should appear
twice, and the rest should appear once.  Professionals should be expected
to have a significant number of the one slots skills, but will still miss
half of them.

Here are the tables that led to those conclusions.

I generated 1000 characters.  Each term, I gave them 5 picks from the
tables.  When I was done, I counted skill levels.  Note that this Monte
Carlo simulation could be thrown off by the random number generator, but
these results seem to be fairly robust to changing the generator.  Also,
with 1000 runs, we likely have roughly two significant figures, though the
table below prints out three decimal places.  Someone who feels energetic
might want to use the law of large numbers to see just how good these
estimates really are.  Or might want to run similar analysis for a few
million characters.  As far as the Mark One Eyeball says, do not trust
anything after the first decimal place.

The table below shows, out of the 36 skill slots, how many slots had a
given level of skill that appears just once in the tables.

For example, after 1 term, you can expect 31.26 skill slots to have never
been selected, 4.49 to have been hit once, and 0.25 to have been hit twice.
 Alternatively, a character who has gone through one term can expect 0.25
level 2 skills, 4.49 level 1 skills and 31.26 skills that were available on
the tables that they did not get at all.

Note that every columns must total to 36, and that if you want percentages,
you can divide the number of skills on the table above by 36 to get the
probability that a given character who served that many terms will have a
given skill at the specified level.  For convenience, those charts are
given here.

For example, after 1 term, roughly 1% of the skill slots have been hit
twice, 12% once, and 87% never.  Thus, if a skill is in two slots, the
chance of it being hit

four times: 1% * 1% = 0.01%
three times: 12% * 1% + 1% * 12% = 0.24%
two times: 1% * 87% + 12% * 12% + 87% * 1% = 3.18%
one time: 12% * 87% + 87% * 12% = 20.88%
never: 87% * 87% = 75.69%

Putting a skill on the table twice means that a person who only serves one
term still has a three in four of not getting it, which is perhaps 12%
better than if it is only on the table once.  So far, so good.

And the expected skill level is .2088+.0618+.0072+.0004 = .28, so tasks in
a profession that they expect a one term chap to do regularly better not
require more than a quarter of a skill level on average for something that
is on the table twice.  (This probably really means is that they better
require a skill one no more than a quarter of the time, and the rest, a
skill 0 better be able to handle it.)

It also means that expected skill level of something where they come in
with a skill 1 is a lot higher than they would expect to get via natural
means over the first one or two terms.

In order to make this process easier, I reran the Monte Carlo with
assumptions of skills being on the tables twice and three times.  The
numbers are reproduced below.

And I am trying to point out that building and technical resources are

SpinWard Marches Sector - data taken from "Supplement 3 The Spinward
Marches"

SubSector	Class A	Class B	Worlds	Total #
				w/TL>=9	of Worlds
========	=======	=======	=======	=========
Cronor 		3	4	13	24
Querion		0	6	7	21

Rhylanor	7	8	15	32
Mora		6	5	11	26
Trin\'s Veil	6	9	11	33

For the sector, we have a total of 53 Class A starports and 114 Class B
starports supporting the civilian and military needs for an entire sector.
I would also point out that there are only 13 Class A starports TL D+
(only 3 of the coveted TL F Class A starports), and that there are 3 Class
A starports that are (surprisingly) TL 8-.  (House rule - Class A starport
must be TL 9, Class B starport must be TL 8 - comments?)  There are 208
planets with the TL base to support the stellar community.  This is from a
sector with 440 mainworlds.  (ie. Class A - 12%, Class B - 26%, TL9+ - 47%)

Any single starport can only build so many ships at a time.  And,
commercially, you are only going to build the capacity that will be used,
not the maximum the planet can support.

So, back to the question that spawned this data deluge - how many ships
will a starport be able to build?

Right.  That\'s the point I was trying to make.

ahhh...

IMHO, Any military alliance within the Imperium is going to be soundly
slapped down.  That\'s a direct challenge to the authority of the Imperial
nobility (and essentially, resulted in the chaos of the Rebellian).  Any
support for the individuals planets is requested from the Imperial Navy.

The Imperium is ultimately a capitalistic society.  If you need something,
you pay for it.  If you can\'t pay for it, you do without.  That\'s why
Class D and E starports are a hazard, and because they are a hazard, they
are unable to get the trade and credit to make them safer.

I tend to see piracy as being cyclic.  An area is vulnerable, and begins
to report piracy.  Eventually, enough pressure is generated to create a
response (either a temporary visit by a CruRon and it\'s support ships)
which will scare off the corsairs, or a more permanent placement of Patrol
Craft.  Corsairs, not being totally stupid, leave for greener pastures.
Reports go down.  Patrol crews get bored. Navy officers (having missed
thier decoration roll and their promotion roll) clamor to be transferred
to "greener" pastures where they might shine.  Resources are re-allocated.
Corsairs beging to operate in the area again...

System Defense would be static, but again resources would not be allocated
for the poorer systems, because it is a waste of resources to defend
those systems.

Also, just to let you know, it\'s available on the Freelance
Traveller web site,
http://www.dragonfire.net/~FreelanceTraveller/Features/RuleAnal/KB20.htm
or .html

I encourage people to send stuff to me for including in Freelance
Traveller; now that I\'m not going to classes two nights a week, I
have a better chance of being able to update the site on a timely
basis.

I\'m playing around with the conceptual design of a new mercantile

unrealistic as to be worthless, and the DGP mod to the MT system
not much better), and I want to test some of my ideas with real
ships.  As near as I can tell, most campaign groups will most
likely be using (or trying to use) one of the following ships.
I\'d like _accurate_ T4 profiles for them, including

	Cost of construction
	Maximum Jump Rating
	Number of staterooms suitable for high passage use (given a
		crew with the appropriate number of stewards)
	Number of additional staterooms suitable for mid passage use
		(given appropriate steward crew)
	Maximum cargo capacity (either tons displacement or cubic
		meters, I don\'t care which)

This represents a minimum amount of information; if the standard
profiles include all this, then they\'re fine - but I don\'t know
if I can trust what appears in Starships, or which if any I can
trust from the other T4 releases.

The ships I\'m interested in:

	Scout/Courier
	J1 Free Trader
	J2 Far Trader
	Subsidized Merchantman
	Yacht
	Subsidized Liner

I assume you have made a decision regarding what kind of combat system you

What is it?  By this time, enough combat systems have been designed, that
it is going to be reminiscent of one of them.  A sorta-Battle Rider, or a
sorta- high guard abstract one, or a counters on the desktop-style like
classic traveller?  Is it going to be very detailed like Brilliant Lances
or Star Fleet Battles, or rather loose, like the original CT one where a
ship is described by half a dozen numbers?

I am asking, as I want to do a few ship designs to try out some ideas for
my own private design system, also FF&S2 based, and it struck me that I
might do it best if I know just how much armor is good, how much weaponry
is good, that kind of thing.

BTW: in my own game, I use the following very abstract system.

The rules:

I.  The typical secondary weaponry of a ship of that class can smash a
typical system in two hits if it hardened, one hit if it is not.

II.  Ships have a good dozen to two dozen systems, so a battle with
secondary armaments will take a while.

III.  A spinal mount can cripple another ship of the same class in three or
four hits, so battles with spinal mounts tend to be fast and bloody.

IV.  A spinal mount from one class is about 2-3 times as effective as the
secondaries on a class one size larger.  Since combat space on a ship space
is divided roughly equally between defense, secondary armaments, or primary
armaments, you want a spinal mount if you are going to face a ship of your
class, while you could have twice the secondary punch if you live without.

V.  Crew skill is very important.  A few genius pilots, gunners, and so on,
can turn the tide of a battle.

VI.  Good lock ons are worth a lot as well, especially if linked with good
tactics.

VII.  One tech level is a factor of ten in combat power if fundamental
systems have not changed, and up to a factor of a hundred if they have.
For example, when Bob Meson built the first Meson gun, it invalidated every
design out there until the meson screen was created.

VIII.  The fuzzy wuzzy fallacy means that an increase in combat firepower
of a unit of x results in a factor of sqrt(x) in actually deadliness.  I
have not decided whether this affects ship combat.

Therefore, a destroyer hit by another destroyer\'s main gun and full
secondary armaments by surprise is likely going to be very, very unhappy.
Likely smashed beyond recognition.

T4.1 is the core rulebook for Traveller 4th Edition, so it needs to cover
all the Milieaux under consideration.

Although TL12 is the standard for M0, M1100 is TL15, and M1115 (the
rebellion) has marginal TL16 abilities, and TL17 hinted at.

M1100 is the period associated with Classic Traveller and many campaigns
are still played then using T4 rules (mine is for example). Hence TL15 is
necessary. (The errors in EA refering to RoM technology >TL13 can be
ignored and treated as future 3I weapons).

Nitpick ;-)

you mean \'in the sense of long term *energy* storage\'. Power is *rate* you

If it\'s any help, when we discussed 101 Lifeforms at EuroGenCon we agreed
on \'roll lower\' as the convention as it fitted in with T4\'s target numbers.
IIRC the tables actually generate \'roll higher\' values.. which means a
herbivore is more likely to attack than a killer... p142 discussed rolling
under a value

Unless they are generating using the old \'roll higher\' convention from CT
and MT?


I have been regenerating the numbers based on the assumption that the roll
is on 2D6 as a baseline (ie 9 on the rules given would become 5..).

Not quite. It is an energy storage device (a flywheel) that is designed to
deliver energy at a high rate (ie complete discharge in a short period of
time). \'Batteries\', ie electrochemical cells,  suffer greatly from repeated
discharge (shortened lives) and also from deep discharge (can cause the
cell to die).

>What would be the damage effects of strapping a power plant to the laser
>(most likely fusion) and firing a continuous beam?

If you deliver the power continuously, you need a much bigger (bulkier,
costly) generator, and the support equipment needed for this. Your
generator needs to be able to meet the peak demand of the laser
continuously. You may also have to upgrade the laser to handle the constant
heat.

Admittedly, Fusion plus makes this viable in T4 but this isn\'t in TNE\'s
version of FFS. Naturally, a continous beam would do more damage over time
(it\'s a question of RATE of energy deliverly). Lasers in Traveller and 2300
do damage by high energy delivery in a very short period. There\'s a good
discussion of the philosophy of laser design in 2300 IIRC.

Yes. Translating the continuous fire into game mechanics could be fun though.

thermonuclear fusion for a while and enter the melee weapons debate.... You
guys think I\'m wierd for wanting to crack worlds - and here we are
designing swords which burrow into the target. For some reason that idea
made me shudder. 

Seriously, in considering HTH weapon damage we have to consider how melee
weapons do damage.
	There are three ways: 
	By Transferring Kinetic Energy (like blunt instruments)
	By Direct Tissue Damage (cutting implements)
	By Internal Organ Damage (Thrusting weapons, which also do DTS)

The KE delivered by a club is not in the same league as that delivered by a
9mm bullet. The effect is to displace and somewhat batter  tissue rather
than impart huge amounts of energy and rip the tissue to pieces. Melee
weapons are thus limited in ways that bullets are not - unless said melee
weapon is propelled by a forging press. There will be upper limits to what
a melee weapon can do to its victim, limits not far ahead of what we can
manage nowadays.

Allow me to cite some examples. To do this I will present you with some
kinds of sword.

First there\'s the traditional light cavalry sabre, a curved cutting sword.
Take the British 1796-pattern light cavalry sabre if you want a definitive
type. This weapon is designed to slash against unarmoured targets. It is
designed for a \'hit and slide\' wound, cutting the target open as the curve
of the blade slides it past. It\'s not actually that important how hard you
hit, so long as the weapon is sharp and it\'s moving parallel to the
victim\'s flesh then it\'ll \'lay a man\'s bones open to the wind\'. Keeping a
good edge is everything, but so long as you do - ouch. However, this type
of sword will bounce from a thick greatcoat (at Balaclava the Heavy brigade
found their swords incapable of penetrating Russian greatcoats, and had to
resort to Number 5 and 6 cuts - to the face. Sabre types should perhaps do
a straight 2D in Traveller, and be pretty useless against armour. There is
less impact than slicing, \'bread knife\' effect.

My second type of sword is the thrusting, \'foil\' type. Damage is based upon
penetration, as would be the case with a knife or similar thrusting weapon.
A sharp point and \'slippery\' edges would be advantageous. This type of
sword needs to penetrate only 2 inches into the chest cavity to cause a
major wound - internal organ damage and all that. Getting 2 inches\'
penetration with a slashing sword is pretty difficult. Foil damage should
be in the 2D range, or perhaps (6+1D) to reflect the unpleasantly fatal
nature of such a length of steel inserted into the chest cavity. They
should also be treated as armour-piercing if the blade is stiff and thin
enough. If it isn\'t VERY strong, such a weapon would snap rather than
penetrate heavy rigid armour, even if driven hard enough. More likely it
would just slide harmlessly off. Soft armour like Cloth (or Diplo?) would
be quite vulnerable to stiff thrusting swords which while also being
elegant, are more lethal against diplo-armoured nobles than handguns
(assuming you take diplo as ballisitic cloth and not very good against
armour-piercing swords. I do. Why else do all these nobles carry blades?)

The third type is the heavy cutting sword, like a broadsword, the Austrian
pallasch or maybe the Traveller Cutlass (yes it\'s curved, but....) Now
these swords rely upon impact of a sharp edge, not slashing as such. Impact
is the cause of damage. So hacking weapons do damage based upon the
wielder\'s strength. Say 1D + 1/2D per 3 full points of STR? That makes STR
12+ guys with axes rather dangerous.! Soft bullet-resitant armour wouldn\'t
be that good against this type of weapon - your diplo might stop the axe
from cutting you, but the bludgeoning effect would most likely shatter your
ribs
anyway. 

I don\'t think we can justify much more damage than this. It doesn\'t matter
whether I push a snapped-off fencing foil or a TL 12 Neutron-forged
superdense Mega-Estoc into your right lung. If it\'s moving fast enough to
act like a bullet, OK (maybe someone fired it out of a mass-driver) but
otherwise, these two weapons are going to damage just as much tissue. Melee
weapons, like I said, are pretty much limited by what they are, not what
they\'re made from.

Now, if the weapon (eg our thrusting sword) could be augmented in some way
such that it is no longer \'just\' a melee weapon....

Eg - the rather nasty idea of nano-machinery shovelling away as I thrust at
you. Or treating the blade with complex compounds such that it releases
nerve toxins upon contact with human blood. A breakable tip, which leaves a
small quantity of poison, acid, explosive or antimatter (Kidding!) in the
wound - all would augment the damage, but only by changing the weapon.
Likewise causing the weapon to vibrate or become hot - these are extras
which could be built into a weapon, but a sword remains a sword.

To get the most damage from melee weapons I recommend a good thrusting
sword with a sharp point, teflon-greased edges, and maybe a blood gutter to
prevent it getting stuck. Then learn to use it properly. It really doesn\'t
matter what you shove into someone\'s eye socket (other, perhaps, than eye
drops). The net result is much the same.

And if you really want to do more damage, well then....
I\'ve got a nice line in Mass Drivers over here....

My, that\'s a tough one!  [think, think, toss coin...] Pending further
analysis on this issue, the CSC system will be eligible, on the basis that
it is a canonical Traveller design system, and excluding it would be
rather arbitrary.

Note, however, that I\'m personally unfamiliar with CSC vehicle design; if
there\'s some facet of CSC which is so much better/cheaper than the FFS
family of systems that it would seriously unbalance the contest, let me
know and I\'ll reconsider this ruling.

Another possibility is a "spinal mount" sized plasma weapon configured
as a "drill". Land the ship (with meson screens on), and start "burning

If available, you\'d want tractor beams to scoop material out of the

other means of taking out such a site. And it\'s re-usable!

Not quite. It\'s a means of storing power "slowly" and releasing it
*quickly*. Think of the clip on strobe light flash units for cameras.
The wimpy little batteries in them *can\'t* trigger the strobe (it needs
several *thousand* volts and a bit pof current as well). So some fancy
tricks with capacitors and switching get pulled so that the power is
drawn from the battery as fast as it can supply it and then
"concentrated" and dumped into the flash unit in a microsecond or so.
Even so it takes many seconds to accumulate the power for that
microsecond pulse.

The homopolar generators perform a similar function. They store energy
as you pump it in at the highest practical rate. Then they *release*
that energy in a *much*, MUCH shorter interval (thus increasing the
*power*).

First problem is getting a power plant than can supply the required
*power*. Second is getting cables that can conduct it to the laser.

Not "some cooling problems". Massive cooling problems. You\'d likely
melt the laser in the first few seconds.

Nope!

You forget that the crust is relatively thin. And that everything under
it is *fluid*. Once you get deep enough, the fluid will flow back into
the hole about as fast as you knock it out of the way. 

Hitting the core is *not* simple.

Too late. Check back issues of the list for my plans for building a
1000 km long mass driver into a rock/ice body in the Oort cloud and
using it to toss "rocks" at planets. The "typical" round was 1 ton at
1.5% c, but larger and slower rounds are possible.

Any grav vehicle should exploit naturally occuring lift where possible. Even
if Fusion+ means cheapest of energy, a lifting body hull shape means more
power for weapons and less for pure lift.  The oblate spheriod, flattened
sphere or \'saucer\' shape make sense. Treat the main weapon as a spinal
mount, and the boundary between tank, atmospheric fighter, space fighter and
SDB blur into nothing. The only question is the default (resting) position
of the prime weapon when powered down: polar or equitorial?

Well, for one thing, it depends on what you mean by "destroy". We are
*currently* capable of building a weapon that would make the planet
unihabitable. And it wouldn\'t even be that expensive.

We might even be capable of building one that\'d "wreck the planet
(render entire surface and most of crust molten).

Both can be done using a "simple" fusion bomb. You just make it *big*.

Just like the US and USSR fought a nuclear war? I suspect that planet
busters are "scary" enough to act as a detterent.

Basicly a tractor is a uniform pull regardless of distance (sort of
like a chunk of the grav fielsd of an infinite flat plane). 

I suppose you could mess with a tractor to give a proper decrement to
the beam. But that would make things *very* range dependent. You\'d not
only have to have it aimed in the right direction, you\'d have to have
the range set right.

And having the beam "spread", limits your range, because the farther
out you go, the weaker it is.

Jory, 

I think you\'ve got the wrong game. Go out and pick up a copy of GURPS
Lensman. :-)

While I\'ve never read the GURPS sourcebook, I\'ve read all the Lensman
stories. And if ever a universe was suited to munchkins, that one is!
(The "final confontation" involves throwing planets with an FTL
relative velocity at the enemy home world and star).

Of course, the author went even farther in the Skylark stories, but
those aren\'t suited to role playing. That one ends with stripping stars
from one galaxy to throw at the stars of a second galaxy, while
transferring non-combatant planets into safe orbits around stars in a
third galaxy!

That should be "mille passuum" (genitive plural of "passus" -- "pacem" is

Not only is this highly unlikely, it contradicts published canon. In Milieu
0 one of Cleon\'s reasons for founding the Third Imperium was to combat
piracy, it is specifically prohibited in the Warrant of Restoration.
Adventure hooks and essays in M:0 show the extreme lengths Cleon went to
eliminate piracy; F+ fighter craft, the Imperial Navy, the New Justice
fleet, to the destruction of foreign starports even *suspected* of aiding
pirates.

Moreover, I can see no evidence in *any* of my Traveller material that
piracy was tolerated inside the Imperium. Every example of piracy I can
find was supported by foreign governments. The Reavers, the Morinmoss
pirates, Vargr corsairs, the "Pirate\'s Lair" in Lishun, the Castran
Marauders, all come from *outside* the Third Imperium, in some cases entire
subsectors from the border. Since starships require an enormous
infrastructure to support, I can\'t buy individual ships making a living by
attacking free traders. Hostile governments, on the other hand, have the
resources and will to disrupt trade in its enemies. The Castran Marauders,
for example, could more properly be considered the Navy of the Swanfei
Independency.

In the material I have, piracy is organized by hostile governments and not
individuals. However, I don\'t have every adventure or supplement written. I
would especailly like to hear how piracy is handled in the Flaming Eye
campaign, can anyone with that campaign give use information?

Is a \'pace\' defined as two steps, as in successive plantings of (say) the
right foot?  Otherwise this implies a stride length of more than 5 feet...

Yep. To the Romans, a pace was defined as noted. Please note that a Roman
mile was slightly shorter than a modern stature mile.

My theory is you can hold a steady beam for a few seconds then you have
to let the whole thing cool down, but if the pulse rate is 100 per second
even a moving target should be easy to cut through...hmmm..

Hehe Fusion power at Tl-17 can get pretty compact!

Yeah I know... but I meant it in the scale of a device that is rated in Mj
storage rather than Mw output (where Mw\'s are Mj\'s over time yes?)

To me the simplest "high tech" improvement on melee weaponry would be
electric shockers fed through the blade (make the blade laminated with a
thin insulator in between or athrusting one with two isolated needles at
the tip. Most hits that pnetrate armour/clothing would stun the target and
subsequently the attacker can cut him to pieces at aeisurely pace.

So I would add 50% to that figure for other expenses. That\'s Cr600 per month
or Cr7,200 per year. Then I assume that people pay 25% in taxes on the
average (Note: According to _Pocket Empires_ this is on the low end of the
scale for taxes). That gives an average income of Cr9,600 which I rounded
up to Cr10,000. @5% taxes gives you Cr2500 per person of which 20% goes to
defense. Now, that isn\'t so unreasonable, is it?  >>

Ok, you  took personal expences (7200/yr) added planetary taxes(?) back into
it (+2400 =9600cr) then you rounded up (10,000) so far I\'m with you, now you
sutracted the Imperial taxes of 5% (which is actualy 500cr.).  I suppose you
probably mean 25%, but what about planetary taxes? those goverments don\'t run
on their own.

Well, what I meant by "focus" was a narrow beam tractor, say with the same

But lots of planets in the Imperium have captive governments.  These
planets are owned or ruled by other planets.  This is a lot more control
over the other planet than in a mere alliance.  Why would the Imperium
permit ownership of other planets but prohibit the less threatening
alliance ?

IIRC, in TLWH this was supposed to indicate that these NPCs had pretty much
dedicated their lives to that particular skill (and were thus experts), or
were naturally adept due to adaptation to the environment, etc. I think in
the original TLWH (vs. the IG LWH & Gateway) we had wondered about putting
even higher skill levels, as at the time of writing, I had only seen a draft
of the T4 rules and it wasn\'t clear to me how high \'expert\' skills should
be. Would you believe it! TLWH and T4 was only launched here in the UK just
over a year ago. Doesn\'t time fly! :-)

>From a quick perusal of the skill charts, it looks like most professions...

From a quick perusal I didn\'t see anything in your text to indicate
considerations such as cascades and clusters, where the player gets to
choose a particular skill. For a character who wished to specialise in a
subject, this makes quite a difference to their final balance of skills.

IIRC, the new T4.1 advocates choosing skills above rolling them?

Anyway, well done Scott for an interesting look at skill generation! :-)

I\'ve not had any problem with this.  Basically it makes it *likely* that
the result will be at the higher end of the table which tends to make
sense, but it is *possible* for it to be anything.

If you want something random you could always roll 3D-3.  Note that this
does not make all possibilities equally likely though. My *guess* is that
this was what was intended and may have been left out.  Golly gosh, an
erratum in a DGP book???  ;-)


I always assumed that you were simply to pick what you felt was most
appropriate bearing in mind all the previous details of the world that
you\'ve generated.  By the time I get to this stage I reckon I have quite a
\'feel\' for the planet and what would be appropriate.  If I don\'t care or am
not inspired, I just pick one (and this is *assuming* that I feel a \'world\'
religion is appropriate - I usually generate religions separately so one
world might have several or nothing particularly).  [1]


Then again I also use the URP for personal beliefs of NPCs (you only need
to revise the \'number of adherents\' to something like \'number of
like-minded people\' or whatever).



Having said all this, I confess that I don\'t exactly create hundreds of
religions (!) so it\'s not really a problem anyway.  Perhaps it could be a
new BITS book, 101 Religions.  Anyone interested if I started putting some
together?

One of the MT books. I\'m almost sure it is _Rebellion_, but I\'ll check when

Really? Well, that was changed subsequently. I\'ll dig out the reference
for you. Again, I\'m _almost_ 100% sure of the 10,000 systems, but my
memory is not always reliable, so I have to hedge.

That should have been 54 billion people, of course. Btw. note that if you
assume an average population multiplier of 5, then you get a total population
of 55.555555555 billion, which is pretty close to the other figure (In my
own universe I use a D9 to generate population multipliers for all population 
levels up to 9, but only a D6 for population 10 worlds; this gives me an
average population of about 1 billion per system, but that is, of course,
not canonical.)

I don\'t follow you here. How do you arrive at those figures?

Well, that seems to make a consistency check, then.
 
>I don\'t know where you got your taxation figures, so I won\'t make any

According to an old CT module called _Trillion Credit Squadron_ the naval
taxes of a world equals Cr500 per citizen. Another GDW publication called
_Striker_ had a more detailed way of calculating taxes which ranged from
about 1/3rd of the above to a maximum of 15 times that (ie ~Cr2,500).

I\'m not wedded to either of those systems, but I\'ve been using TCS figures
for over a decade, so those are the ones I\'m familiar with. Now that
_Pocket Empires_ are out I expect that I\'ll one day sit down and see what
results you get if you use them for starship building, but until then I\'m
sticking to TCS. But I\'m perfectly willing to either go along with or poke
holes in any other taxation and shipbuilding scheme that anyone else takes
the time to crunch numbers on.

	The basic idea in the teflon bullet appear to be largely
	misunderstood, and the version of the story I learned is
	completely different than the "teflon-coated-low-friction-
	cop-killer-bullet".

	When "teflon" is mentioned, most people will think about
	low-friction coating in their cooking hardware. However there
	are several kinds of teflon plastics, and one form of teflon
	is commonly used as non-slip surface in the lower part of
	a walking stick.

	The original idea of teflon bullet was to improve the bullet
	biting angle so that the bullet would not ricochet from car
	windshield so easily. The inventors returned to an old idea
	of coating arrowtips with beewax (assumed to improve arrow
	biting angle against plate armor), and coated the bullet
	nose with high-friction teflon.

	The teflon coating did not improve the bullet performance
	sufficiently, and the project was dropped. The later anti-
	windshield bullets had crown-like serrated nose.

	However, the idea of teflon-coated armor-piercing bullet
	caught the public attention, even though there was very
	little real-life data. Teflon bullets generally appear
	only in low-quality films (Knightrider, etc.).

	The story behind the teflon bullet can be found in back
	issues of "International Journal on Impact Engineering".

So it does, except that carnivores gets low attack and high flee numbers
and herbivores vice versa. Also, trappers and sirens attack if THEY are
surprised ;-).

(Btw. there is also a typo: A pouncer both attacks and flees if it is
surprised. It should be attack if surprise, flee if surprised.

The MT convention is \'roll lower\' and the two columns are exactly the
ones of the MT rules (from which the T4 rules are taken almost verbatim)
switched over. And the numbers have not just been reversed to reflect a
possible change to \'roll higher\' in T4. (The text has \'roll lower\' in one
place and \'roll higher\' in two other. I omitted that because it has already
been noted in the errata someone sent IG and they put on their web page
(back when they still updated their web pages occasionally). 

>I have been regenerating the numbers based on the assumption that the roll

Try comparing the T4 rules with the MT rules. Let me know what you find.
I\'d like someone else to check that I haven\'t just misread something.

This says very little. The important thing is how many high-population worlds
have Class A and B starports. Shipyard capacity is based on population size.

>(House rule - Class A starport
>must be TL 9, Class B starport must be TL 8 - comments?)  

I play it that a Class A starport on a TL9- world is maintained from outside
and that its size consequently has no relationship to the popualtion of the
planet it is on (Usually it is pretty small).

>There are 208
>planets with the TL base to support the stellar community.  This is from a
>sector with 440 mainworlds.  (ie. Class A - 12%, Class B - 26%, TL9+ - 47%)

But there is a bias built into system generation that gives high-population
worlds a higher average TL. There\'s also a rule somewhere in a CT
publication that I keep losing track of to the effect that ships of up to
5000 T may be built by worlds without Class A and B starports (provided it
has the necessary TL, of course).

>Any single starport can only build so many ships at a time.  And,
>commercially, you are only going to build the capacity that will be used,
>not the maximum the planet can support.

The shipyard sizes defined by TCS (roughly 1T/year capacity per 1000
citizens  --  there are also government modifiers, but it averages out
at 1) are for military ships only. All commercial traffic is ignored
(except that the civilian shipyards must be the reason why shipyard capacity 
can increase dramatically from one week to the next when a world goes on a 
war footing).  

>So, back to the question that spawned this data deluge - how many ships
>will a starport be able to build?

Sample world with 50 billion inhabitants:

Military shipyard capacity: 50,000,000 T/year
Naval budget: MCr 25,000,000/year
Fleet size: 500,000,000 T*

Shipyard utilization:
	New construction: 10,000,000 T/year**
	Maintenance:      10,000,000 T/year***

*Assuming average warship costs MCr0.5 per T; this is propably not far wrong
 for jump-6 ships; for a system defense boat it would be more like 0.85, but
 let\'s be conservative here).

**Assuming useful life of a warship is 50 years.

***Assuming flawless rotation of all ships; propably not realistic, but there
   is plenty of slack, as you can see.

As you can see there is actually plenty of shipyard capacity left over, so
perhaps civilian shipping IS included. There\'s no rules for the deleterious
effect on civilian shipping of using up all the capacity for military ships,
so I guess the evidence points both ways.

If I was running the Imperium you\'d have a huge number of warships laid up 
in ordinary and a fleet only half the size indicated above, but even half
a fleet is still an enormous number of ships.

In a sense all Imperial worlds are allied. We do have indications that 
individual planets are allowed to own jump-capable ships (You can get 
astrogation skill even in planetary navies and the standard patrol ship
is jump-capable) though there could very well be severe limitations to 
their size. In a pinch the local Imperial admiral no doubt has the
authority to commandeer local planetary ships. But that wasn\'t what I was
aiming at at all. I was just pointing out that even outside the Imperium
pirates would have a very thin time of it, as long as there was a single
high-population world nearby. Strend (just rimward of Five Sisters) could
for example easily keep Menorial Subsector clean on its own.

Balder-, if you will excuse the expression, -dash. The Imperium protects
client states far beyond its borders. It even protect non-client states that 
happens to lie in designated protected districts. It will certainly protect
member systems to the best of its ability. And that is very, very able.

Turn the thing around. Why in the universe would the Imperium _fail_ to
picket any and all of its systems (and quite a few of the systems beyond
its borders) and thus weaken their early warning capability? That just
don\'t make sense. That has nothing to do with piracy at all. That comes
naturally from having enemies. And we do know that the Imperium have
enemies, don\'t we?

I still haven\'t put my point across, have I? Ships may (almost certainly
will) be rotated, but there is no lack of resources, no reason to leave
any system unguarded, and some reason not to leave it unguarded. Not 
necessarily very urgent reasons, and if the ships were needed elsewhere
some systems would certainly be left unguarded, but unless there is a
major war going on, the ships _won\'t_ be needed elsewhere.

"I do not claim that it will not require considerable assets to prevent
piracy, merely that it will require considerably less than what is 
available."

No, it is not a waste, because you have the resources anyway. Not to employ
them _would_ be a waste. And, btw. every time you prevent the capture of a
single free trader, you save enough to keep two patrol ships going for over a 
year. To allow piracy when you can prevent it is the way to waste resources. 

Incidentally if a ship is captured in a C, D, or E system, odds are 
that the ship belongs to another planet, one that does command patrol ships.

Which is good enough for me -- I\'ll only be buying GURPSTrav stuff until (if it
ever happens) IG gets their act together. Of course, like I\'ve said, the chances
are good that unless IG *does* get their act together, there will be *no* IG
within a year or so (or less) and GURPSTrav will be all she wrote.

If you don\'t like GURPS, tough. *I* didn\'t like the stupidity of Virus in TNE,
nor did I like the stupidity of 1st Printing MTrav. No-one consulted me, then,
either :-)

Someone will correct me if I\'m wrong, but IG doesn\'t get licensing fees from SJG
- -- the *parent* Company, Sweatpea, does. Now, it may be that they will use the
fees from SJG to cross subsidise IG -- but this doesn\'t necessarily make good
business sense!

Right now we only know Classic Traveller, having just revisited it after

ruleset? Is 4.1 available in the UK at all?

An initial stab suggests character, planet, subsector generators plus 
animals, encounters and so on. Any suggestions or feedback gratefully

One minor point...those \'glass blades\' are literally stone age technology,
TL0, being knapped pieces of obsidian. The TL-1-2 Mayans used obsidian
blades like that for surgery, and fairly similar blades were in use in
delicate things like eye surgery until lasers came into widespread use in
the last few decades.

CSC/EA don\'t include any weapons that are really useful at spacecraft combat
ranges, so people using them will have to put in weapons from some other
source (which should be easy enough.) Armour conversion (so one can compare
designs) is also tricky...the conversion tables in EA were supposed to be 
flawed somehow. Finally, propsective CSC users should be aware that
the best sensor in CSC is about a A1 or P1 in other terms, which is pretty
inadequate, so they may also want to use sensors from another supplement.
(Once I know what TL the contest is I may make some QSDS sensor packages 
appropriate to it.)

I can\'t remember where I read this, and I would appreciate it if someone
would correct me if I am mistaken, but I believe that captive governments
within the Imperium signify a planet under direct Imperial control (ie.
military government).

Does anyone else remember this, and where it came from?

I agree - TNAS *MUST* be 100% compatible with FF&S2. An updated QSDS would

Hasn\'t this been mentioned numerous times before?

If you\'re an armoured Marine boarding a (space) ship
which is depressurized, lacking gravity or both, it\'s
not always great to have a projectile weapon, as it
can cause a lot of damage to sensitive ship components 
which you may not want to damage and something like a
PGMP has a lot of kick (although it would make a good
backup one-man reaction drive if you get trapped in
deep space...). That\'s (presumably) why Marines all 
get cutlass-1, even in the 54th century.

Besides, it just seems so "retro" - 

"Prepare to repel boarders!"
"Boarders in visual range, Captain!"
"What are they wearing?"
"Gold lame bell-bottom battle armour, Sir! And they have axes!"
"Damn! It\'s the Imperial 1978th Squadron! Prepare to retreat!"

   Glass blades are really, really sharp, but really, really brittle.
The trick is finding a blade that is both sharp enough, and hard enough.
Also remember that even space armor has weak points.  Joints, visors,
gaunlet palms.  I\'ve always been a fan of armor on the backs of gaunlets.
Not only does it make punches do more damage, just placing your palms over
your face adds another armor layer to the visor.

>	I just wonder why no one had thought of this in before.
>Hell a trooper in battle dress with a really sharp axe could cut through
>most types personal armour!

   Well, it has been thought of before.  I personally am one of the people
who have beat their space axe into a blunt object on the subject.
   I still feel that battle dress/combat armor should have a retractable,
crystiron or superdense spike mounted on the forearm.  For close quarter
ship board fighting.  Unlike the water knife (which does have the advantage
of range), that spike\'s tank will not run dry on you at the worst possible
moment.
  But then...I  am a fan of the chest mounted claymore option for battle
dress as well...

*Character generation with print capability for quick NPC\'s (have both
the long form, where a player can roll up a character just like he would
in the book, and have a quick random roll, where the GM can hit one
button and roll up a Rouge, or whatever, in a flash.)

*Program that takes the UWP data and follows the extended system rules
to develop an entire system, complete with maps of the solar system
(similiar to those used by DGP)

*Traveller world mapping utility, for detailing a world, using the rules
in the WBH.  A map should be printed.

How\'s that for starters?

This sounds like that Dr. Who Episode "Pirate Planet" where basicaly a 
hollowed out world jumps around another in order to mine all its resources. 
 Nasty!  I am asuming this is where the idea originated? :-)

Fuel isnt the only problem.  What about the planet\'s own gravity well?  What 
would happen to the planet with the planet-wide jumpgrid going into jump 
since it cant get 100 diameters away from itself.  Would the planet...(Looks 
around to see if Hengebar Spofulam of his kids are listening and in a hushed 
voice...)er...go boom... or misjump?.  Also would everybody have to go 
underground and close the venitian blinds or go nuts from looking up in the 
air at the jump field?  Just what we need, an entire world of lunatics 
jumping into an unsuspecting star system...hmmmm....sounds like a EEEEEE-vil 
little scenario!

The fuel is the real killer problem, of course... you need planetfuls
of fuel to jump planets around.  Pity, that.

The rest of it, if you think about it, isn\'t so bad.  6.5 ExaCredits
isn\'t too unreasonable, the whole 1100 3rd Imperium has 11k worlds,
of which 1/36th have pop A (10s of billions) and 2/36th have pop 9
(1s of billions); assuming a median multiplier of 3.3, that\'s a
total population of slightly larger than 1.2E13, with an annual naval
budget of Cr500 times that or Cr6E15.  We\'re within a couple of orders
of magnitude of being able to pay the annual maintenance on a whole-planet
sized drive...

If you scale it down some, making the assumption that warships cost
MCr1/ton new and maintenance is 10% of hull cost, the Imperium could
build large jump-capable battle stations of say 1.5% of total available
funds that was in the 1E15 ton range, which works out to 186 kilometer
radius (about 370 kilometer diameter)...  and if a hundred-kton warship
gets a hundred megajoule spinal mount, then this guy could mount say a
trillion-megajoule spinal mount particle accellerator, which is the
same energy as a 250 gigaton nuclear bomb.  Heck, that would do a number
on a whole planet...

Thermal management would be a real mess, though... you\'d have to have
very complex and vulnerable cooling systems to dissipate all the waste
heat from the power plants ;-)

I must have missed something - is the military budget 500 cr per person
per year, or per month?  (hmmm...do I have a copy of TCS around
somewhere?)

A population of 50 Billion indicates a Pop A world (defined as
tens of billions). Your "sample" slants the scale to the extreme top end
of the charts, and has a single world population greater than the Cronor,
Querion, Darrian, Five Sisters, Jewell, Vilis, Sword Worlds, District 268,
Lanth, Lunion or Glisten _Sub Sectors_.  For that matter, your single
sample has a population greater than Cronor, Querion, Darrian,  Five
Sisters, Vilis, District 268, Lanth, and Glisten combined (49 Billion).
The entire Spinward Marches sector has a population of 872.123 Billion
and 11 Pop A planets.

Population distribution for Class A and B starports in the Spinward
Marches - circa 1100
	
     Starport Starport	
Pop	A	 B
===  =======  ========
1	2	2
2	4	1
3	1	6
4	5	18
5	10	19
6	5	25
7	3	23
8	4	17
9	11	5
A	5	2

While Pop A worlds are associated with starship building starports, the
bulk of the class A starports are either Pop 9 (Billions) or Pop 5
(Hundreds of Thousands).  The bulk of the Type B (spaceship) starports
range from Pop 4 (Tens of Thousands) to Pop 8 (Hundreds of Millions).  Of
the 3 TL - F Class A starports I mentioned in an earlier post, Glisten has
a Pop 9, Rhylanor has a Pop 9, and Mora is a Pop A.

Based on these numbers, I\'d be looking at much, much lower figures for a
military budget.

Considering that we have some fairly active ship-designers on the list, we
should be able to get pretty accurate numbers.  Anyone care to comment?

Useful perhaps.  Effective lifespan I would argue... (useful relating to
the lifespan of the components, effective relating to the military value)
But then, that\'s what the Reserve fleets are for, right?

Oooo Sounds good!

It would have to be in the same format; just a couple of paragraphs with

Playing TNE (yes, really), the characters finally catch up with the
merchant ship full of baddies they\'ve been after. It\'s carried a salvage
crew to a ruined city on - oh, some world or other. I can\'t remember now.
The characters approach on foot. The ship comes in to pick up the salvage
team - quite a lot of them, well armed, and led by a superhuman
combat-clone killing machine whose brethren the characters were hunting
down. 

All hell breaks loose. A firefight shapes up across the cleared area within
which the merchant lies - many of the salvagers can\'t reach it, but the
characters, who want to capture the ship, can\'t either. Combat Clone rushes
across the battlefield, shooting with absurd accuracy on the run. I\'m
confident that he\'s invulnerable in his battlesuit and internal
modifications - and he\'s the first one with the \'once I die, I get four
minutes of frenzy\' super-oxy-heamoglobin-charger built into his blood
system. Hey, this\'ll be fun, I think.

But no. One character siezes the shoulder-fired missile launcher, takes
aim. 
Ref; "Truly impossible staggeringly difficult roll to hit, please."
Player: "Okay. Yeah, made it." (he did. I watched)
Ref: "You\'re within minimum arming distance. The antitank warhead won\'t
detonate. Impact damage only."
Player: "Yeah, OK. But you said I could see his face. Facelplate\'s open,
then?"
Ref: "Uh-oh. Yeah, I suppose...."
PLayer; "Location roll.... Ha! head."
Ref: "How much damage would that do... let\'s see.... Bollocks!"
(Combat Clone flips backwards, killed instantly by a missile in the
forehead. You can\'t frenzy if you\'ve gort no head.)

The same player then ran a hundred yards across open ground, armed only
with a sabre (by the way, he\'d never fired a missile launcher before. It
was a \'Skill-0\' attempt!), reached the ship unscathed as the others shot
down the door gunners. He then entered the ship, sabred the pilots and
landed it more or less intact. 

This guy\'s luck was just awesome. One of the pilots managed to miss him
four times with a handgun before being cloven to the teeth. It was one of
those nights where he just couldn\'t miss!

I would suggest looking at the existing software and either (1) imitating
it and opening it to a new platform (i.e. Metator by Rob Prior is only for
the Mac) or (2) Going in a totally new direction.

There is a program out there called Library by Jo Grant (aka Jo Jaquinta)
which is exactly what I would want; a cross between Metator and Jim
Vassilikos\' Galactic.  You start at the Full map of known space, zoom in on
a particular sector (which is "dotmapped" the a specific subsector.  From
here you can hold the pointer over a particular world and see the "quick"
details, or double click on the world to get the full picture.

If it is the first time this world was clicked on it will prompt you to
generate the full system details including trade tables, world map, animal
encounters, satellites and other planets, weather and temperature,
sociological, religous, and economic data.  In addition there would be a
"GMs Notes" associated with section which could hold vast amounts of
information about whatever category the GM wanted to elaborate on.  All
stats would be fully editable, random tables could be easily added to, etc.
etc.

If it is not the first time through, the information shown was what was
originally generated and entered.

Trade information would produce two tables, one for the players with what
is available (fully detailed down to exact lot size and qty, not what to
roll!) and one for the Gm with recommended sale price included for the
specifid destination world.

Well, you wanted to know right?

Oh, did I mention that it should use the "standard" DGP .sec files as
input?  or that it should be cross platform?

Be aware that you stand in the shadows of giants in this endevour.  Perhaps
you should try standing on their shoulders instead?

put this up with the best of the IG products I\'ve seen, but it
certainly rates a passing grade.

In keeping with past IG issues, the cover is a piece of Foss
artwork which (a) does not strike me as "Travelleresque" and (b)
has no apparent connection with the subject matter.  \'nuff said
on that.

The book is divided by general classification (personal,
passenger, etc.) and then by motive agent (wheels, tracks, etc.).
In general, lower tech vehicles appear before higher tech
vehicles; personal vehicles appear before passenger, commercial,
or industrial.

Each vehicle described has a card that describes the vehicle\'s
most basic stats, such as name and model, cost, number of
occupants, fuel type or power source, size and mass, required
environment, speed, skills needed, et cetera.

Some of the entries on the card which should be purely numeric
are in a descriptive code; others that should be descriptive
codes are numeric.  Explanations are, as usual, at the back of
the book.

Each classification has a drawing of a representative member of
the classification (left page) and cards for four vehicles (right
page).  The draft animals page has pictures of four animals, but
there is no clear identification of which animal goes with which
card - or even if they do.

As usual, there are some clear typos; some of the aircraft are
listed as requiring atmosphere 0-9 - I fail to see how you can
achieve lift at all in a vacuum, and I don\'t believe that
significant lift can be generated in a trace (1) or very thin
(2,3) atmosphere.  Some of the watercraft also have problems in
my estimation; I have some trouble believing top speeds of
150km/h or more in kilotonne-mass boats.  I suspect that many of
these are off by a factor of two, at least, and more likely ten.

I would have liked to see an example FF&S sequence for designing
some of these vehicles; I\'m not sure that there\'s enough
information to reverse-engineer them without a lot of trial and
error.

One other error is that there is no blank vehicle card to copy
for your own vehicles; the unfilled one in the back of the book
is defaced by the grey stripes pointing from the explanations of
the captions.

Overall, I can give it a passing grade; the information provided
will probably be enough for most campaigns; the errors and lack
of design sequences and more complete information, plus the
missing blank card, prevent it from going any higher.

A neat supplement.  One problem, there are no tech levels listed with the
vehicles.  Now don\'t panic!  They are not \'broken\' because of this since
most of them are clearly at about Imperial M:0 TL12 and none are clearly
well above this point (some are quite below - but how far!?!).

The information on the vehicle cards is presented in a useful, compact
fashion, and is complete from a users point of view.  Each vehicle \'type\'
(such as "personnel, tracked" or "AFV, Wheeled" or "personal transport,
Rotary Wing") has (I think) 4 examples (maybe its three) which are suitable
for photocopying and folding in half to make one, two sided vehicle card
about 3X5 inches (8cm X 12cm for you metrifans).  I suppose you could cut
them right out of the book though :)

This was a quick look (came Monday the 29th in Boston MA) and I\'ll make
comments later as playtesting commences (which will hopefully occur
Thursday).

Wait a sec, are you saying that a world the size of Earth is most likely to
have a smaller moon than a world the size of, say, Mercury?  That smaller
planets tend to attract larger moons?  This seems counterintuitive, but I
have no facts to go on.

If the above is true (smaller planets attract larger satellites) then it
seems to me that the original designers probably simply did not take this
into account, so the "errata" that you refer to which would produce a
satellite 1-6 size categories smaller than its mainworld (if I am reading
it correctly) is simply "the way they did it" rather than "errata".  [as in
"what do we fill in for the satellite formula?", "Well, we want it to be
smaller than the mainworld...how about a UWP of 1-6 sizes less than the
planet its orbiting?", "Sounds good."]

OK, first I will address more general issues (that, in some ways,
are more important that just "are there pirates").  Also, it need
to be remembered that you are trying to claim that piracy can\'t
exist, not that you can come up with number to justify a setting
in which piracy doesn\'t exist.

Much of this is the classic mistake that is often being made
looking at big organizations.  You look at an impressive sets of
resources and do simple calculations about all the great things
they can do, but those simple calculations ignore that large
organizations have complex webs of needs and you have to start
getting into them all before you can even hope to be able to say
what they can afford or would be wiling to commit to.  After all,
these sorts of calculations could also be conducted to prove that
street muggings would never exist because the US could easily
afford have a cop walking on every street in every major city.

A lot of this is based on the 500 Cr per person figure.  It is
doubtful that this was created with enough thought that it can
be used to calculate the entire budget for the Empirium (and
this is the flip side of the warning I am always giving of
throwing in new elements and the consequences thereof, see
below *).  Other people have pointed out that this number is
very high when you compare it to the stated cost of living.  It
is true that you have run through your own set of numbers on
how this _might_ be reasonable, but that is not a definitive
analysis that can support the view that piracy _can\'t_ exist.

Finally, even if you could show that the Imperium can afford
to, in principal, patrol every bit of settled space (and I
don\'t think you have, see below), you still have a problem,
that is that the decision would have be justified at all levels
of decisions making.   The cost of suppressing piracy has to be
justified at each world and it is very possible that the Imperium
may look at a low traffic system, look at the cost of keeping
dozens of patrol vessels on station continuously, and decide
that it would be cheaper to let the pirates take a cargo once
in a while (it probably would be).  You also have the problem
of complacency.  It is human nature that if piracy is driven away,
then the lack of actually losses means that people are going to
begrudge the resources being expended on it and they will be
reduced (until it reappears).

But above and beyond the above, once you correct for the mistake
(some of which have already been pointed out by others) I don\'t
think you have shown what you feel you have.  Getting to the
specifics....

>instructions to remain quiscent no matter what. A scout is supposed to get

Again, you are looking at pirates operating out of fixed bases
with prior intelligence as the only model of piracy.  In fact,
the movies not withstanding, this military adherence to specialized
roles is the least common mode.  One of the more common is that you
simply have armed ships that engage in legitimate trade (or some
other activity like smuggling) until they spot a  target of
opportunity.

>>>when an expense applies equally to everybody, as this one

>>But the same thing applies to piracy.

>Sure. But the thing that applies to piracy and doesn\'t apply to traffic
>control is that everybody agrees that piracy is a bad thing while not
>everybody agrees that traffic control is a bad thing.

Well, they actually do.  If you look at any case of traffic control
and ask those involved "would you do this is if it weren\'t for
the safety needs?" the answer is no.  (This is why there are
unregulated intersections).  So the result is that traffic
control is like anything else.  The cost of it will be weighed
against the benefit.  In this case the cost of wasting fuel
and time on every single chance will be weighed against the
rare chance of loosing a cargo to piracy.  It is not at all
clear the choice will come down in favor a wasting fuel
and time.

>I never went away from it. The major point of my argument is not that it
>doesn\'t take considerable assets to suppress pirac

It actually does.  It\'s the classic passive situation such
as the US faced in Vietnam.  To do what you want you have to
be able to respond to anything reasonable that might happen,
including alliances (temporary or otherwise) and the enemy
having initiative and surprise.  This is why the US, even
with the resources that it committed (to which many experts
went though analyses that were a lot more sophisticated than
yours and felts would be sufficient to do the job) was unable
to stamp it out.  The enemy was able to take advantage of
the passive nature of the US position and simply chose
tactics that gave them a local advantage and melt away
(often mixing with legitimate traffic like a pirate would)
when the advantage was no longer there.

>>Or he simply can jump in and take targets of opportunity.

>Fallacy. See below.

Again, this is based on looking only at pirate in fixed bases.

>>Low level piracy has been tolerated by governments in numerous historical

Actually not true.  Piracy is tolerated in Asia when there are
a number of countries (including the US, Japan, and India) that
do suffer some from it and could, if they really wanted to, do
something about it.  It just costs to much.  Similarly piracy has
existed around the other major empires in history (Roman,
Chinese, English) and it is in fact somewhat true that
rather then being wiped out by these empires, the pirates
depended on them to generate traffic.

OK addressing points in your analysis that I haven\'t seen addressed
by others...

>At Cr500 per person in naval taxes you get a naval budget of 270,000,000 MCr.
>Let\'s err on the side of caution and cut that by a third = 180,000,000 MCr.

Actually, you are being optimistic.  Even in our high tech armed
forces salaries are a bigger cost than equipment and it is not
uncommon for things that need a lot of support to have worse
that a 3:1 ratio for support vs front line.  Finally, you also
have to pull ground troops out of this budget.  I would say
that even 1/10 of this figure is optimistic.

>200 T patrol cruisers are used for piracy suppression, so
>presumably they are a match for the average pirate;

Well, no.  A pirate can easily have a 200-400 T ship and you have
to be able to handle them even if they cooperate and also
catch you buy surprise.  This is totally inadequate and the
Kinuir equivalent you mentioned is much more reasonable.

>You can
>get about 1,800 Kinunirs for 1,800,000 MCr. (All figures are CT).

And if you correct for math errors and the points I raised,
you are down to 54 Kinuirs.

>System defense budgets for your average population 7 world is 70% of
>7,500 MCr, which gives such a world a system defense force equivalent to
>roughly 50 Kinunirs (or 200 patrol ships). I think the average pop 7
>world can take care of itself,

Well, I have doubts about this.  Your entire defense budget is
7,500 MCr.  You are lucky if you can keep more than 10% of this
devoted to fighting units and you have to pay for salaries as
well as equipment.  You also have give some to the army
and then the larger percentage of this is going to be
grouped to form fleets of decent size, some of which will
be sent to the front lines.  If you take your assumption
that you can easily spare 1 out of a 1/1000 for piracy
suppression and that 10% of your money goes to fighting
units, and that 1/3 of this goes to ships rather than
salaries (which is optimistic) then your pop 7 world isn\'t
even close to taking care of itself.

>Except that very few systems will have traffic in and out of Gas Giants

Sorry, Gas Giants, either directly or indirectly, are a main
source of fuel in traveller.  They are going to have a lot
of traffic.   Now you might want to change the background
to make this different, but if want to talk about piracy
in the background as it is given, then this such traffic
is a given.

>But there will be a correlation between the population
>of the system and the number of places with activity, won\'t there?

Well, no.  There will be a correlation between population
and the _density_ of traffic (As you have growth, higher
population densities result from the filing in and building
up of already settled areas rather than expansion into
new areas, which happens early) so that lower population
systems have near as many places to protect, but less
traffic in each place (which makes the decision to
commit resources to stopping piracy in those areas
even harder).  Additionally, you also have traffic passing
through the system on their way to somewhere else.

A system with 30,000 people might easily have 20,000
people on the main world and 3 mining areas with
3,000 people on them (and generating traffic due
to ore shipments that is disproportionately high)
and also have traffic (both from/to the system and
passing through) in one or two gas giants.

>That\'s 6 (or let\'s call it 5) of our 30 systems that
>only require one spot guarded. Put 5 Kinunirs in each of those

Well, in addition to the points above, I also still
disagree (as I point out above) that your scheme for
forcing all traffic through one point in every system
for every jump is a given.

>>Either the pirates jump in blind near a spot where they have a chance to

>stationed there, or they arrive out of range of the patrols, in which
>case they will be too far from their prey to surprise it. You\'re trying
>to have it both ways, and it can\'t be done

Again.  You are assuming both your scheme to have required jump
points and pirates operating out of bases.

>Same mistake. Either the pirates jump into a system cautiously, in which
>case the patrol ships _and all the merchants they are guarding_ can get
>away by jumping, or they take a chance on surprising the patrol ships.

Again, you are assuming your required jump point area and that
pirates are immediately recognizable as such.

>Same mistake again. The pirates labor under the same two-week information
>delay that everybody else does. There\'s no way they can know if a rowing
>patrol will be there when they jump in.

Again, you are assuming pirates operating out of bases.

*[Ok, this is a sort of footnote because it is off topic.
I don\'t think the 5000 Cr tax shows the kind of resources
that Hans thinks it does.  However, what if it did?  I have
no doubt that when the author first consdered this, it never
occured to him to check to see if this is consitent with the
level of piracy in the Imperium.  It also is not likely
to heve been something that is suggested by people he brings
it up with.  But then things get writting into backgrounds
and people start exploring them.  This is why I am allways warning
people that want to play around with more fundamental things
like how communications work in the Imperium (like the jump
torps in Leviathan).  Another example of this is thread on
jump torps that proceed along for a while based on the assumption
that they aren\'t used because of Imperial policy without
realizing then that you have done nothing to explain why
they aren\'t used by those outside (or from outside) of
the Imperium.  One needs to be _very_ careful with changing
a background after it has been set up.  Especially so
if one is dealing with one of the fundamental building blocks.]

Well, it really doesn\'t matter if the fees go to IG or not.
If they did, the owners (is Mark the sole owner?  Or did he get
investors?  Do we know?  [After all, I don\'t think he has to
tell anyone about such things])  could just take the fees as
profit.  For a privately held company  the difference in
the companies money and the owner\'s money is mostly one
of liability (you can\'t necessarily sue and owener for a
companies liabilities) and wether personal taxes have
yet been paid (unless the owner is another company).

But what the fee also mean, in all cases, is that
IG games is somewhat protected from one very common route of
failure, those who own the company just run out of money
to continue (in world of small gaming companies, this happens
a lot).  Thus IG had the resources to recover from mistakes
it might not otherwise recover from.

         Extents  on the  frontier with  the Vilani.  His parents were
         killed during a Corsairs raid  against his world conducted by
         Vilani  Slavers.   He  managed  to   escape  the  death   and
         destruction of this raid, and vowed revenge.

               Arorrbars\' physical statistics are abysmal; a fall down
         a short flight  of stairs even  in his youth  would have been
         enough to send him to the  hospital. From an early age he has
         lived on the  wrong side of the law,  usually Vilani law. His
         career has  been that of  a pilot, crewing  on several pirate
         cruisers  that   have  preyed  upon   merchant  and  military
         starships  of  the  surviving  worlds  of  the old Ziru Sirka
         (First Imperium).  He has retired  far into Vargr  middle age
         with only a  shotgun, body armor, a vacc.  suit, a handful of
         cash,  and  a  desperate  need  to  run.  Old enemies, bounty
         hunters, law-enforcement officers, and the military forces of
         more than  one Pocket Empire  have hunted him  across a dozen
         worlds.  At the  end of   many years,  he finds  himself deep
         within unfriendly human space,  wasting away from the effects
         of disease and old age.

               His years with the space raiders have given Arorrbar an
         incredible  level of  starship-piloting skills  (Pilot-7). He
         can fly almost any spacecraft  in existence, and knows stunts
         that would  make average pilots  turn white with  terror. His
         missions  as a  pilot aboard  numerous pirate  starships were
         always aimed  against the Vilani forces  and their interests.
         He now rests easy knowing that his parents have been avenged.

               Arorrbar has  style. He knows  how to drive  the humans
         around him crazy, and he also  knows how to make those humans
         laugh. Children of  any race find him to be  a warm ally full
         of stories, and female Vargr find him irresistible. He enjoys
         excitement too much to care about death.

               At present,  we find Arorrbar older  and much weaker; a
         bad fall  would now be likely  to kill him, and  he is racked
         with chills.  His job, money,  and all his  friends have just
         vanished in  the holocaust of  an alien revolt.  Arorrbar was
         fortunate enough to have made  it to the spaceport, and after
         hijacking a small vessel, escape off-planet. Arorrbar managed
         to escape with nothing but  a filthy spacesuit, an assortment
         of  battered  and  mismatched  body-armor,  a  dagger,  and a
         shotgun   and  ammunition.   After  marooning   the  hijacked
         starships small  crew on a  suitable planet in  a neighboring
         system, and  purchasing supplies with credits  taken from the
         ships safe, he has decided to  head for an uncharted area far
         from Vilani space. As his pirated ship shifts into jumpspace,
         Arorrbar coughs  frantically, itching his  greying muzzle. He
         ponders the  future and wonders what  dangers await him ahead
         in the emerging  manrealm whispered to be known  as the Third
         Imperium.

I got the number range of 12bil -123bil by using your system outline ( one
type0, two type1, three type2, four 3, five 4, six 5, five 6, four 7, three
8, two 1, and one A) and the planetary population table from the basic
rules(CT & T4, i don\'t know about the other rules systems stats) which states
pop in units of ten. 0-no inhabitants, 1- Tens of inhabitants,2- Hundreds of
inhabitants,...ect...,A-Tens of billions.  Then at the bottom it says; \'The
population digit is an exponent of 10. The actual population of a world may
range from the exact equivalent of the population to just below the next
higher population digit.\'  Which means at pop. 2 you have between 100 and 999
inhabitants.  I got the Regina range from looking up the pop. code on the
UPP\'s and adding. The accual Regina pop. is in the library data of The
Traveller Book.  (unfortunately the only CT book I own)

By the way, at 10,000 worlds, with 36 worlds per subsector, there should be
281 subsectors in the Imperium. (280.55 actualy)  Is that right, canonicaly
speaking ?  I have no idea myself.
