There is so much canon out there, but so little of it is readily available.
I, for example, have T4, some CT (and some MT en route).  Thats it.

What I need, and others I\'m guessing, is a Canon Bible.
The Gospel of Traveller.

So preach on, preach on.

But perhaps we need to set some Traveller monks on the task of compiling and
archiving canon for the new Travellers that are sure to follow.

You seem to be forgetting that the Imperium is the Good Guys (Registered
Trademark) while the Zhodhani (dirty stinking Zho\'s) are the _Bad_ Guys
(Registered Trademark).  Obviously just because the Good Guys can
discover something does not mean that the Bad Guys can discover it.

As I recall, the humor in Greek comedies is still understood. And their
culture was quite different, and 1500-2000 years from ours. I seem to
recall that jokes have been found written in hieroglyphics in ancient
Egyptian sites, and that they are understandable. I\'m not sure if
they\'ve found any Sumerian humor. But I suspect that the humor would be
understandable, it\'d just be the cultural references that would be
different. And the context of the joke will tell you which "ethnic
group" is supposed to have what characteristic.

Except that you don\'t navigate by looking out a window. And between
battle damage risks, and the need for shielding from flares, the big
bridge windows as pure BS. You\'ll by looking at a viewscreen, using
whichever hull camera is the best choice. For that matter, it\'s quite
possible to have purely *optical* viewers (sort of an advanced
periscope system) that avoids the possibility of electronics failures. 

In all these cases, you are looking at a "screen", which is in front of
you, with the view being whatever angle you want.

The *only* time a forwarding looking "window" is of any use is for
docking nose first, or for operating at *visual* ranges and speeds (ie
in an atmosphere, and damned slow by spacecraft standards). Heck, given
the likely "up angle" the ship would need to get decent lift, you can\'t
even use the "window" on the typical "wedge" configurations while
*landing*.

How does that "save on the artifical gravity"? 

In a parallel orientation, you have to *neutralize* the thust of the
main engines *and* generate artifical gravity at right angles to it. 

With a perpendicular orientation you only need to generate gravity when
the ship\'s thrust is less than one g (or whatever you run at) and only
need to neutralize when the ship\'s thrust is higher.

If *I* was designing the rules for ship design, this would be taken
into account. And it\'d be cheaper to build and operate ships that had
gravity and thrust aligned (decks perpendicular to the thrust axis).

The ship you are thinking about is  the  Tiaflfiet  class  Patrol
Frigate from IISS Ship Files by Games Workshop.  They also  wrote
Adventure 4: Leviathan, which was published by GDW.  In the later
was a mention in Library Data to the Shivva class Patrol  Frigate
which also carries a telepath for ... coordinating action between
friendly ships (as Bruce suggested above).  Of course,  being  in
Library Data means it is subject to  potential  inaccuracies  and
thus is officially "maybe"-cannon.

I thought of another naval application of psi:  What about a  Psi
with Precognition, assigned to the planning staff of an  admiral.
Know where the enemy will be  before  the  enemy  decides  to  go
there!

IMTU = In _My_ Traveller Universe, David is referring his interpretation of the 
game.

I totally agree with David on this point the point. I believe that RW spacecraft 
designers keep the number of windows down to a minimum for good reason. As 
David pointed out their disadvantages far out weigh any advantages; and with a 
reliable intergrated sensor package there really is no need for them. It looks 
"cool" for a saceship to have windows, but in reality they are no more than a 
totally unnecessary point of weakness.

Seems to me that this would be one area where the Zho\'s would be working 
on advances which would allow additional focus/psi protection from such 
pulses.  Again, should they develop such an ability, there would be an 
equal and opposite reaction from the Imps to counter the advantage...  A 
tech increase (or ability) matched by a tech increase.

I agree about the point of weakness.  IIRC, the High Lightning class had 
a lounge at the tip of the gooseneck that was transparent.  Allowed for 
the wide angle view of the heavens for "relaxation" I guess.  I can\'t 
imagine putting these on a warship.  Did they have plating that could 
cover it?  I seem to remember that the broadsword did...  

Insert of Broadsword writeup:  "2.  Owner\'s Lounge.  For most routine 
functions, this area is used as an adjunct to the owner\'s suite for 
entertainment purposes.  It is one of the most spacious and luxuriously 
appointed of the areas on board.  Nevertheless, efficiency and economy 
dictate that this area also be used as an exercise room, auxiliary 
dining room, and as a marshalling area for troops used in boarding 
parties.  A large starview ceiling (defined by the dashed line; 
covereable with steel shutters in times of danger) pierces the hull over 
this room and the adjacent owner\'s suite."

I\'d put these on private luxury vessels, like the yachts that were 
designed in one of the competitions.  And on liners for passengers to 
ooooh and aahhh from.  I\'d expect that they would be tied to the sensors 
so that in the event of a flare they opaqued....  I might put a bridge 
window on smaller merchants for the landing on lower classed starports.  
But on a warship?  No way.  

As I said in a previous post, you might have an aux bridge or landing 
station (behind airlock type hatches of course) to allow visual control 
at the point you are trying to make contact.  However, their use would 
be few and far between.

I like the idea of view screens tied into all the ship\'s systems.  
"Magnify, Number One".  "Aye, aye, sir.  Magnified".  "Show me that data 
output on the main screen..."

I still have my doubts but I accept thats the way it is IYTU. I find
the argument that there should be no window pretty convincing.

Additional write up from "Broadsword":

"24.  Vision Screen.  The major display device for the bridge is the 
vision screen.  It can dsplay exterior views from any angle and interior 
views of many locations within the ship itself.  In addition, the 
display screen is normally operated in split mode, showing many 
different readouts monitored by selected crew personnel.  Any specific 
readout can be called up on demand; the computer itself displays those 
readouts with anomalous data being displayed automatically, calling 
attention to the problems and potential problems of the current ship 
situation."

The bridge is on deck C, three levels from the prow for the very reasons 
Dave mentioned.  The vision screen covers about 1/4 of the bulkhead in 
the bridge, in front of the "control pit".

Broadsword is a warship, it put the bridge in the middle of the ship
with a C^3I center. Such a configuration should be standard for
all warships except those that intend to land often - and even those,
if big enough, may want another bridge that is behind several layers
of deck/armor/fuel.

Azhanti High Lightnings were originally built with a casual bridge full
of windows at the front of the gooseneck, the real command bridges
were in armored decks many levels to the rear. The casual bridge
up front (According to _Arrival Vengeance_) was eventually ripped
out on all the cruisers and replaced with a starview lounge. They kept
it on the AHL\'s that were converted to cargo use - probably so you
could move the ship around a crowded Highport at docking speeds
with a minimal crew.

Most small trade ships will want the bridge up front, probably with
windows. This makes it easier to segregte the bridge from cargo
and passenger areas, and allows (as someone pointed out) use of the
Mk I eyeball in docking situations and low-tech starport landings.

Speaking of the Mk I eyeball...I was looking over Best of the JTAS Vol 1,
at the "Ship in the Lake" scenario. It involves infiltration into a TL 6is
planet, and mentions that the "standard defensive screens" on the player\'s
type S Scout Ship will conceal them from "conventional radar" - that the
only way anyone was seeing their scoutship was with their eyes.
Does anyone know what "defensive screens" they were talking about?
This is probably the only reference I\'ve ever seen to this kind of thing.

Nope.  The casual bridge was only installed on the first three flint boats,
as it was too prone to battle damage.  Of the three, only the Azhanti
herself remains in service in the late 1100s.  There weren\'t many stations
there in any case, so combat operations from the casual bridge would 
probably be difficult.  The fittings were retained, however, and when
some Lightnings were transferred to the IISS or commercial operations, 
the vacant space was converted into a running bridge. 

The original casual bridge had a refreshment station and large holo
projector; judging by _Arrival Vengeance_, some ships converted the open
space into a recreation area.  Perhaps the state-of-the-art jump-5
Lightnings were expected to serve in peacetime roles similar to the
jump-6 rift cruiser of the 1100s; high-speed transit of vital personnel
and use as diplomatic vessels?

That was early stuff, where lots of stuff that was never mentioned again
was included. I\'d amend that to it being stealthed, rather than some
active \'screen\'. However, TL12 steathing probably does include some
active component against radars, since our current technology has some
things working toward that end.

There is one thing you are forgetting. Technology does not just cover
spaceships and guns. For example, my present job involves working with
Machine Translation engines. They aren\'t great, but they aren\'t that bad.
They are noticeably better than they used to be, and they are due to get
even better. There are companies out there offering real-time translation
of web stuff. Basically your browser fetches the page via a MT proxy which
translates it as it uploads. Given the inherant delay in accessing many
web-sites it isn\'t that much of a drain.
Anyway, the point is that in the Traveller era, MT is likely to be to the
point where it is quite simple to produce a document in many different
languages. Should the Karoghlian\'s wish to keep their peasants speaking a
different dialect, that shouldn\'t really keep them away from information.
Unless they control the import/export, anyone selling them stuff would most
likely be willing to offer it in whatever language they desired. The latest
scout survey of Low Karogish is likely to be enough to feed into a TL12
translation engine and provide perfect documentation.

Cheers,
Jo

 Dort ein Ding Sie ist vergessen. Technologie bedeckt Raumschiffe und
 Waffen nicht gerade. Zum Beispiel schließt mein gegenwärtiger Job ein, mit
 Maschinen von maschineller Übersetzung zu arbeiten. Sie sind nicht groß
 aber sie sind nicht so schlecht. Sie sind sichtlich besser als sie waren
 und sie sollen sogar besser bekommen.  Es gibt Firmen und bietet die
 Echtzeitübersetzung von Netzzeug dort draußen an.  Grundsätzlich holt Ihr
 Browser die Seite über eine MT Vollmacht, die es übersetzt, wie es
 hochlädt. Die inherant Verzögerung gegeben beim Zugreifen auf viele
 Netzstandorte es nicht so viel von einem Abfluß ist. Dennoch ist der
 Punkt, daß in der Reisendenära MT sein wird zum Punkt wahrscheinlich, wo
 es ziemlich einfach ist, ein Dokument in vielen verschiedenen Sprachen
 herzustellen.  Sollte der Karoghlians wünschen, ihre Bauern am Sprechen
 eines anderen Dialektes zu halten, der sie wirklich nicht weg von
 Information abhalten sollte. Wenn sie den Import/ den Export nicht
 kontrollieren, würde jeder, der ihnen Zeug verkauft, am wahrscheinlichsten
 bereit sein, es darin anzubieten, welche auch immer Sprache sie wünschten.
 Die letzte Pfadfinderumfrage von Low Karogish wird wahrscheinlich genug
 sein, in eine TL12 Übersetzungsmaschine zu füttern und perfekte
 Dokumentation zu liefern.

IMTU, *any* ship that has the capability of landing on a planet has 
viewscreens.  They\'re for emergency use, mainly.  They also have blast doors 
that can cover them for emergencies, like getting holed by a meteorite.

Or when the instruments are out.  The best sensors in the universe won\'t do

I usually put the decks parallel to the thrust axis when I build freighters.  This way, assuming they land, it\'s easier to get at the cargo.  And of course, the ships land on their bellies.  IMTU, the manuvering thrusters are \'pointable\' to allow the thrust field to lower the ship vertically, onto its belly.  Takeoffs are vertical lift to clear any obstacles in their path, then vector horizontally to achieve orbit.

??>  Why would the language spoken by the rude peasantry out in the
hinterlands have such a dramatic influence on the technological level of the
entire planet?  

If it has such tremendous power, the industrialization of Meiji Japan must not
have really happened.  Or of late Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union.  Or
China.  Or India.  

Clearly, a precondition for technical development is having the rural populace
of the country all speak the language of global trade and science -- English,
naturally.  And if they know what\'s good for them, _American_ English, which
history proves to be more adaptively fit and efficient.

;|

The argument I made about diglossia is that people will tend to have control
over _multiple_ linguistic codes, each being appropriate/acceptable for use in
only particular circumstances.  Said Karoghlian peasants might watch every
weekly installment of "As the Capital Churns" as soon as it comes off the X-
boat, in its original Galactic; whether they\'d ever be expected to speak like
that themselves, want to, or have to, are all separate issues that don\'t
follow automatically.

On another line of argument, I\'d envision many other social layers between and
around the Karoghlian peasants and nobles.  Karoghlian merchants, namely, who
might handle all the vulgar commercial aspects of offworld trade in stilted
textbook-precise Galactic, present the traditional handsome cut to the local
noble in a toadying register of High Courtly Karoghlese, and start selling off
their consignment of technological superiority to the hinterlands using
abusive "I\'m an important rich man from the city" register of Southern Low
Karoghlish, possibly with manuals and advertising translated into the same. 

Accordingly, the Free Trader Marava, one of the itinerent shoelace peddlers
compared to _real_ interstellar trade, might land in backwoods Karoghlia --
infamous for its imprisonment in pristine low-tech squalor due to its being
denied the benefits of speaking Galactic -- its crew intent on offloading
obsolete LHyd-damaged microwave ovens with fake product logos onto the local
rubes, only to find that said rubes are careful to speak to them in the
melodramatic, borderline-hysterical phraseology of Imperial soap opeas and
already know precisely what a _real_ Sternmetal Horizons microwave oven looks
like and how they\'re _supposed_ to operate, thank you very much.

>things like that. Especially if such a revolution means the nearest

A lack of Anglophone consumers has hardly put a dent in the export of English-
language pop culture across the world, and I suspect megacorps wouldn\'t find
the question too worrisome either.  At least on a megacorporate scale,
wholesale machine translation for their target markets would probably be cost-
efficient, too.

Resistance to media imports based on their content is another matter.

Yes.

IMTU, just as there are psi-boosting drugs, there are psi-damping
drugs.  Put them in the rations, et voila! no teleporting!  (I\'m not
sure what, if anything, is said in the Law of War about this.  However,

winners as an excuse to hang the losers."

Through interrogation, of course.  ["Joe!  Bring me the TA-312,

proven otherwise.

Very true.  For the Greek plays, the humor gets lost in those turn of the century
translations by I.M. Finley and others.  If you have even the slightest interest in
these, I urge to rush to your nearest book store or library and browse the
Arrowsmith translations of Aristophanes.  They are very modern and down
right hilarious.  They are generally available at larger book stores in the US, at
least, in moderately cheap trade paperbacks.

There is nothing new under the sun.

Jo, this is terrible!  This is simply awful!  You must stop _immediately_.
No, wait, you\'d better keep the job and sabotage work as thoroughly as
possible.  While I\'m sure it seemed like a \'gross\' idea at the time, this
could spell terrible disaster.  I hardly read German at all, but even I can
tell this is definitely more fluent than AltaVista\'s Babelfish engine.  I
mean, I don\'t start giggling before I let the engine put it back into English.

Hey Kurt,

in my setting the 3I uses a drug that they mix into the prisoners food, water,
and air supply in the POW Camps, the 3rd Imperium POW camps are usually built
in hollowed out astriods that are towed by speical Tugs that move them to
where they are needed.  their is also a Hyperspray application of said drug
taht medics administer to wounded Zhos when they first capture them (and to
those not wounded they are \'gased\' with a speical arosal version).

i hope this gives you some ideas for Zho Prisoner care...

Mmm...  need to reread RSB, Rupert.  Particularly the part about Supranormal
Theory (in the ref\'s section especially).  It\'s only the artificial psi\'s who
are dependent on EM patterns for telepathy.  Natural telepathy goes into a
different dimension or something like that.  That\'s how the theory goes,
anyways. ; )  The theory was left unexplored due to the death of GDW so it\'s
validitity is up to you, though i\'d bank on it being relatively true.  There
is precedent in CT adventures.  Also i\'d bank on a twist in there somewhere.
TNE epitomized the best of Traveller (turning things around ala the Aslan and
J-drive, Solomani and the Rebellion, etc etc).

  Again, if the Regency was making advances with almost no efforts, what
had the Zhodani figured out? Within biological limitations (i.e., Cthulhu\'s
special ability) and their TL (no psi-amplifiers unless TL 14-, etc.) they
should have discovered just about everything possible within the psionic
realm of humaniti.

  It can be assumed that there are no major space warfare advantages to be
gained (OK, the existence of precognition makes that very questionable), but
the ground warfare capabilities seem to be understated quite drastically.

  Given that the real Zhodani purpose in fighting the Frontier Wars seems to
have been to maintain the status quo, what arguments can be advanced regarding
the theory that they deliberately held back from using any psionic capabilities
that might spook the Imperium too much* (like using precog if post-war analysis
will make such usage obvious).

that you may or may not have lying around you have demonstrated not only 
your ability, but your irresponsibility to have TL 1+ weapons)

  PS - or, given the Zhodani likely advantage in psychohistory (they _know_
how humans think) maybe their behaviour is also meant to encourage this
theory in Imperial Naval circles, even if human psionics really are only
limited to parlour tricks [and teleporting micrograms of anti-matter into
grav-tank vehicle parks].

  From this a proof arises that increasing the number of Strephons (and or

Strange that all those skyscrapers, which are far taller than six times
their height, manage to stay up perfectly fine and don\'t get blown over by
breezes. If the ship is unstable it will be unstable no matter what it\'s
deck orientation. Ocean ships, which have decks parallel to their long
axis, can be unstable and fall over.

Ships do not get "tossed to the ground". They land balanced or they will
crash, no matter how their decks are aligned. Changing the deck orientation
will not make an unbalanced ship balanced and "tossing" a ship with
parallel decks and thrust axis at the ground has just as low a chance at
landing perfectly. There are vehicles, like the mars lander, which are
designed to land at any orientation and they have a design far different
from anything shown on a Traveller starship. Configuration has nothing to
do with it; you can design a flat slab or tall needle to land at any
orientation and stay up.

Moreover, this balance must be maintaned at all times regardless of whether
it is sitting on the ground or flying in space. Consider that a reaction
drive generates all its thrust at the engine, which even in the
parallel-axis ships is usually located at the far end of the ship. In order
for the ship to fly straight it must be stable along the long axis, at
whatever gees the ship is capable of. If a ship is not going to tumble
accelerating in space at 3 gees it certainly will not topple sitting on the
ground at 1 gee. However, your parallel-axis ship must be stable along
multiple axes, and in the transition as it flys. Ships with perpendicular
decks and thrust axes have none of these constraints.

I can\'t believe you\'re serious. First of all, pilots do not navigate
interplanetary journeys by looking out a window, and even if they did your
statement makes no sense. People don\'t become any more "disoriented" by
crawling, climbing a ladder, or accelerating in a car, which is movement
not perpendicular to gravity or where "up is forward". Yet people do become
disoriented by spinning, which is perpendicular to gravity. If you just
want to watch scenery you can put a viewport anywhere you want.

What? You have been claiming all along that a parallel orientation is
better if a ship lands! Did you make a mistake or are you claiming it is
only better in space? In space it is still worse because you need an extra
gee of compensation to counteract the ship\'s acceleration.

Unfortunately, landing in a ship with parallel decks and thrust will make
the problems of varying ship orientation, shifting cargo, multiple stable
axes, and landing area worse.

True, in jump space the deck orientation is irrelevant, so a perpendicular
orientation is no advantage. It is only better when there is an external
force, like an acceleration or gravity field.

I think you have your terms swapped; ships with decks perpendicular to main
engine thrust are still safe and usable even if contragrav and inertial
compensators didn\'t exist; parallel decks and thrust are unusable without
them.

Even if contragrav and internal compensators were totally reliable, never
failed, and used no power, it is still economically unsound to use
spaceships with parallel decks and thrust axes for the reasons I have
already gone into detail for.

The reason Traveller ships have parallel decks and thrust is because they
were designed by 20th-century artists who think starships are a kind of
airplane

I agree. In Traveller, they have the technology to build starships with
parallel decks and thrust, even though there is no need. Airplanes aren\'t
equipped with high-altitude emergency escapes because the cost/benefit
ratio is near zero. Parallel decks and thrust have a high cost and no
benefit at all, in fact they are disadvantageous.

Actually, most small vessels require decks laid out perpendicular to the
axis of thrust primarily because they are easier to draw.

However, small vessels (ie: <1,000 tons, with the exception of a few like
the MC) with their decks orientated the way you describe would make for a
vessel with many, many tiny, cramped decks.  Passengers and crew would have
to move about the craft primarily via ladders and lifts, which can become a
bit of a pain.  Only with larger ships does this "skyscraper" layout begin
to become practical.

Don\'t get me wrong, I like the "skyscraper" layout like the AHL.  I just
don\'t think it works well with the smaller displacement ships, within which
most Traveller players spend most of their shipboard time in.  I\'d like to
see the deckplans for a scout/courier with such a layout.  Cabins would
have to be arranged one to a deck and stacked on top of each other :)

I see your point, but doesn\'t software in Traveller already do this? After
all, there is Gunner-1, -2, and so on. The problem is not that computer
software isn\'t upgradeable, it\'s that it has been ignored in most design
systems.

I think these capabilities are dangerous and useless. They would more
likely be used by hijackers than against them, will anger passengers, are
vulnerable to accident or sabotage, will be ineffective against a prepared
attacker, and risk enormous collateraral damage. I agree the crew won\'t use
them much because they won\'t be very effective; it is hijackers that will
use them indiscriminately.

If the Concord had a loophole that huge it would be worthless, the same
excuse would allow any kind of automated defense at all.

I agree with the Concord both on moral and playability grounds; it means
that if the players resort to violence they will have to do the dirty work
and suffer the consequences themselves.

I guess we\'ll just have to agree to disagree.

It is not necessarily true that the ship computer can interface with all
systems. Even if the ship has High Automation, which most combat ships do
not, subsystems can be isolated units not under external control. This
applies to all campaigns, not just TNE. Even if the computer has total
control of the entire ship this does not make it legal, moral, effective,
or dramatic roleplaying for the ship to be designed specifically to kill
the crew.

Ultimately though, this is not relevant to how the anti-hijack program
works. Even if it were theoretically possible for the computer to kill the
ship\'s occupants this does not mean that commercial software will be
designed specifically to do it. For example, the fact that someone can be
killed by a car is not relevant to making burglar alarms set off AP mines
under the driver\'s seat instead of that annoying siren.

As an aside, would you want to fly in a plane that had AP mines under the
seats as an "anti-hijack" device?

Huh? All I am saying is that things like poison gas dispensers and
bioscanners are hardware, and must be purchased and installed separately
from software. If your software "anticipates" hardware that isn\'t there it
certainly will be of no use at all.

Anti-hijack is a MCr 0.1 computer program, and if buying a copy suddenly
makes hardware appear all over your multi-kiloton spacecraft this will
unbalance the game.

Depends on the translator.  Well, really, the performer too.  These were plays
and
not books. I can say from personal experience that it is difficult to play the
lead --
Pistitairos, IIRC, the mayor of Cloud Couckoo Land -- that it is very difficult

to perform the role with a straight face.  Especially when the sophists bring
the
books with rules.  ("Its in the book!")

Which was why I mentioned that it\'s perfectly doable to have purely
*optical* "viewscreens". Lenses, prisms and mirrors. And a few
mechanical linkages (which would be in the bridge, not out at the
lenses). So you are watching a "projected" view from whichever lens
you\'ve selected. And you select via what is essentially a mirror
behind the screen. So if something breaks, you can open a panel and
move the thing by hauling on a rope or something.

Good example is subs. They have the bridge in the "middle" of the ship,
but also have the "dodger bridge" on the conning tower for things like
docking. 

And I seem to recal that some ships have a "pilot\'s bridge" that gives
a better view for the benefit of harbor pilots piloting the ship into
the harbor.

I\'d say it was something that slipped past GDW. 

If the Type-S is the wedge configuration, then you could stealth it
fairly easily, as it\'s already essentially a series of flat planes for
most of the hull. You\'d just have to make the hull a lot smoother than
the illustrations show.

I\'d say that a psi shield will block teleportation. 

Alternatively, given that things like clothes and armor go with the guy
when he ports, I\'d say that anything "connected" to him has to go
along, and that "connected" is loose enough that a cain connecting him
to something solid will count.

So you just keep him chained to either something solid or when moving
him around, to a couple of guards with guns. He ports, he has to take
them with him, and they shoot him. 

To avoid telekinetics picking locks, I\'d *weld* or *rivet* the
bracelet/anklet onto Zhodani prisoners. I rather suspect that this is
how the Zhodani themselves handle the situation when they have to
imprison someone *without* burning out their psi centers.

Well, precog may have problems with a situation with as many variables
as space combat. One interesting use might be to enable Zhodani task
forces to exit from jump more closely than Imperials can. After all, if
you can know in adavance how long you\'ll be in jump, you can "tune"
your entry.

However, I\'d say that for playability, precog, when it works, should be
of a "this is what WILL happen". In other words, if your precog saw it,
you can\'t change it (unless he actually failed the precog roll and saw
the wrong thing).

This limits the strategic utility *greatly* and reduces it to a limited
tactical role.

Transparent metals are *really* hard to justify. But there are lots of
strong transparent materials. I\'d have the dome be something really
strong, but not metallic. And of course, the dome is useless during
flares and during battle. I\'d definitely have the bulkhead be hull quality.

I\'d also go to the expense of having the dome ground optically "flat".
That way, with only a simple corrective element, you can set up a
telescope in there and get good images. This could be handy if the ship
is coasting on minimum power. You can keep an eye on something without
a big sensor signature.

the Imperial Crown as canon symbols, as well as the Starburst/Sunburst.
Also, Archduke Norris uses a unicorn as his device.

My questions,
 1) Should all Imperial Noble headgear (crowns, coronet\'s, tiara\'s, diadems,
etc)
      be  made of irrridium?

(Carefully avoiding the Irridium Baseball Cap, common among Solomani
Baronet\'s in Reaver\'s Deep)

       It need\'s to be impressive, beautiful, and hard to find/make, I would
think.
      Assume that nanotechnology is impossible because of [handwave].

       I doubt if diamond would be the right choice (to easily made

       and gold/sIlver/gems would only be used by low-tech families,
(although
       some Very, Very Old Vilani and Solomani families may use it, to show
       how long they\'ve been around...)

  3) As an aside, what were the symbols of nobility during the First and
       Second Imperia?

Personal guesses as to various Imperial symbols...

1) Animals from Vland and Terra - ie nobles riding horses, lions, etc
2) Weapon\'s - swords, maces, First Imperium laser carbines, Colt .45\'s
3) Starships - Starship & Crown (Asimov\'s Empire), warship surrounded by
     star\'s, three Sylea battleship\'s around a world, etc.
4) Astrological and astronomical stuff - Chinese and Babylon astrological
    symbols, star\'s & novas, ringed planets, nebula\'s, etc.
5) Religious symbols - Christian crosses, Islamic cresent/star, Communist
    Hammer & Sickle, Vilani traditionalist glyph\'s, assorted new
    religious symbol\'s, Star of David, depending on the noble house.
6) the Vilani oval (symbol: First Imperium) and the U.N. globe of Terra
    (Second Imperium), as well as the Imperial Starburst (Third Imperium).
    Maybe Circle & Cross (Astronomical symbol of Earth, used as the national
    symbol of the Solomani Confederation, but it may also be the Solomani
    racial symbol.)
7) Crowned computer hardware (ie: computers symbolizing knowledge, crowned
    printers symbolizing communication, etc)
8) Japanese nobility likes using flowers as house symbols, European\'s prefer
    shields.... I am unaware of other Terran nobility\'s preferences, or even
Roman
    nobility.
9) Non-Solomani/Vilani nobility - I would guess the few Zhodani-decended
Imperial
    nobility (there must be *somebody*) may use the clouded-moon symbol, or
    something else derived from the Consulate.  Hiver, Droyne (coyns?),
Vargr, Aslan,
    minor-race nobility?

   I doubt if there are ANY K\'kree nobility in the entire thousand-year

fluid to
   expect K\'kree to stick around long enough to be ennobled, or to actually
work in the
   the interest\'s of the Imperium.  If there ever were any, though, they
might use a head
   of lettuce or cabbage....

In general, noble\'s like using symbols that reflect power, wealth, justice,
intelligence,
piety, and all the other things that the general population feels is Noble
and Good.
Often, the symbols should show age and permanence: thus, stuff from Long Ago
from the Home World may be used, as well as representation\'s of various
ancient event\'s.  Imperial nobles would like to reflect their relationship
with
the Emperor: ergo, Imperial Starburst\'s, Irridium-made items, etc are
popular.
Also, as the Imperium govern\'s space, astronomical and astrological item\'s
would be used: warships would be used as well.

Oh yeah, there are also Corporate symbols that would be used: the bigger the
coropration, the better (also, family-owned corporation would use the family
crest, and/or the family will use the corporate symbol as part of their
crest).
Popular among Vilani nobles would be the four Vilani megacorp\'s.

Since the Zhodani military only commissions the nobility, all officers are
assumed psionic.  Also, anyone captured in combat with the Consular Guard
is assumed to be psionic.

EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War) uniforms would include a psi shield.  EPW
facilities would be built with larger fields.  While being transported from
the point of capture to the EPW collection point, care must be taken to
keep the prisoners from identifying landmarks that might aid escape attempts.

Standard policy would be to transport EPWs to the rear, preferably off
planet, as quickly as possible for interrogation and safety.  Once on a
rear area planet, the danger of teleporting prisoners is lower, but
psi-shields and dampers are still used.

This is modified from the US army\'s procedures on handling enemy spec-war
prisoners (Spetz and the like).  One thing the manual stresses is
protecting the prisoners from your own side.  A group of soldiers who have
been under telekinetic and teleportational assault are going to want
revenge.

The Unbridled Steed was long a symbol for the Regina/Jewell area, since
several stars in those subsectors made up a constellation (visible from
where they never say) resembling a unicorn.  Norris adopted it for the
Domain of Deneb when he was elevated to the position in 1116.

The official crest for the office of the Duchy of Lunion is a
Terrapin-class cruiser pointed away from the viewer, towards the stars.
The motto is "Ever in Front"

I think any Zhodani descended nobility would take pains to distance
themselves from any sort of connection with the family\'s past.  By the time
an "enemy" family had enough clout to be granted a patent of nobility, they
are probably thoroughly acclimated to the Imperium.  Remember, they left
for some reason or another!

I don\'t doubt that an Aslan\'s coat of arms would be in the traditional
style, with great amounts of Trokh covering every deed in the family\'s
glorious history.  Vargr would have arms as varied as the race itself, with
one general rule.. it\'s going to be *loud*  (The Baron\'s formal Hawaiian
shirt?  Why not?)

Droyne seem to be to remote to actually become deeply involved in Imperial
government, although the leader caste probably has some means of
identifying different work groups.  Remember, in Droyne society, Leaders
are a different caste, and don\'t depend on patronage or divine right to
rule.. it\'s what they were born to do.

One noble\'s shield I\'d love to see is a Newt lord.  Probably has his skin
pattern reproduced on it.  Imagine introducing a Newt noble at a reception
with *all* honors and titles..

You might be surprised.. these are intelligent creatures (annoying, racist,
touchy creatures, but intelligent).  It\'s very unlikely that any K\'Kree
have ever been ennobled, but I could see it happening.  Imagine a subsector
Duke in the Empty Quarter facing increasing Vargr raids.  He invites some
dissident K\'Kree in makes one of their khuna an Earl, and gives him the
mission of stopping the raiders.  The K\'Kree get to stomp the hell out of
some G\'naack, the Duke gets some new taxpayers, and the K\'Kree get a world.

K\'Kree would probably choose more traditional images, such as the pole arm
that the ceremonial guards carry, or a representation of the Two Thousand
Worlds as seen for Kirur.  Since K\'Kree depend on smell, K\'Kree arms might
have a strong olfactory content.

Those skyscrapers are securly fastened to the ground, so they are not
really a valid argument in this situation. The problem with ships like
needle formed one are that they need good level surfaces to land. It has
to keep its center of mass within the area that is defined by its landing
legs. Once that center of mass wanders outside one of the landing legs it
will fall over. So as long as most of the drives and other heavy stuff is
located in the aft of the ship there are no problem for ships like these
to land put if the ground under one landing leg gives out your in a
trouble, so I wouldn\'t do this to exploratory ships.

This is not really true, as the center of mass has to be within the area
that makes up the landingarea.

This is not really true. Because it is the momentum that decides if the
ships tumbles in flight. If the thrusters force has a momentum that is
zero with respect to the center of mass it will not tumble in flight, but
on the ground the gravitasjon always acts through the center of mass and
therefor gives no momentum. The important factor is the center of mass
with respect to the landingarea.

I think he meant gravity parallell to the thrusters :-) 

I still wonder though how the spinning of the ship to deaccelerate will
affect the two orientations?

But still it doesn\'t seem to be that big of a problem from our experience

I don\'t really see why it is better in a gravity field. Have you given any

As long as the ship goes in a straight line this is true. When spinnig to
change direction or when affected by winds or other forces the cargo
better be securly fastened no matter what type of orientation the decks
have. ANd the amount of ships that go only in straight lines are quite few
:-)

Again as long as there are no spinning or other non-thrust forces working
on the ship. A ship with perpendicular decks is going to have a hard time
going into any gravity field if the cargo is not securly fastened as it
then needs to keep its aft pointed directly at the gravitating bodies
center of mass, so doing any type of course changes is effectivly
impossible.

Ok, to throw a little more wood on the fire here, since the Psi
Suppressions, psionics have been illegal. How does the 3I deal with this? Is
it illegal to demonstrate psionic abilities, or to have them? If it\'s
illegal to have them, how are they found? Do they use supressive drugs,
perhaps the same as Marc suggests or depend on psi\'s NOT to use their
abilities ?

In MTU I take the "illegal to use" path, with repeat offenders subjected to
prision and/or equipt with a small devise that automatically injects them
with suppressive drugs. The device must be re-charged once per month, at a
parole office, since it is surgically implanted and "tamper-proof". If the
charge is left run down the device emmits a radio signal to local law
inforcement.

Well i would say that Psi Shields block the Teleporter\'s ability to see
where he/she is going to Port to, with out such *needed* *Visual*
information such a Port would be suicide if at all possible.

Well from T4 the T\'Porter can choose how much he/she wants to take along so
unless the chain was implanted into the body this will not be very workable.

A more efficient system would be to administer a *drug* that block the
receptor sites for pis activity. But putting such a drug in food and water
etc, would be a maintenance head ache at the very least. 

A better method would be like a "Norplant" type of sub dermal drug device,
and place it on very visible surface like the cheek or forehead, that way
the bulge could easily spotted by security personnel and monitoring
devices. You could even have the implant color the skin around it a very
visible color like bright green.

For a *secure* method of keeping Porters in detention you could also
implant a explosive charge under the skin near something vital, like the
spinal cord. Set to go boom if the Porter leaves the areas defined by a
emitted signal.

The best method for Kinetics would be the psi activity block drug implant.

Personal shields are, but it has been mentioned in several places that you
cna shield larger areas as well.  IMTU, every contract for military
vehicles in the Spinward Marches includes a requirement for psi-shielding.

IIRC alkali metals are transparent to UV, just don\'t don\'t refuel from
oceans.

Is transparent metal as non-hard sf as psionics?

Optics *break*.  They *also* can become misaligned.  Not exactly what you 
*want* to have happen if/when you need them.  If you\'re in deep enough that 
you need to see out, odds are you need undistorted viewing.  The projection

The same properties that cause a metal to be a metal also make it
non-transparent.

You could have, however, a tranparent material that is strong (along
the lines of ceramics).  However, if you are talking an armored ship,
the hull presumably is already made of the best material for the job.
Unless the material is already transparent (in which case the hull
will be mostly transparent) then transparent section will have
to be sacrificing something in terms if strenght or weight.

 Yes, but the question is, how much longer should the citizens of the countries be
held to guilt for something that was done by their ancestors before they were born?
Just when should the guilt stop. The colony mentality was very much a product of the
technology and the attitudes of the times. Just because attitudes have become more
\'enlightened\', should all these revisionists be going back and making us all suffer
for what our forebears did.

The colonial atitude may have been wrong. Certainly horrors were commited, diseases
introduced (many by those meaning well!). But should I born nearly 200 years later
be held to pay.

The problem is that governments tend to do what they think will earn political
support. If you look at Australia, look at the gap in opinion between those in the
cities and those in the country. And what all those observers seem to forget is that
all these legal battles which are fought, ultimately decided by political
correctness at the time, are funded on both sides by the poor average taxpayer of
the country, stretching into hundreds of millions of dollars. The only winners are
the lawyers, a few people at the top of the native peoples, and the politicians
whose huge pensions rise with a couple of extra years in politics.
The native people see no real benefit, neither does the poor bloody taxpayer. And
what happens when the elders of the aborigines try to restore some of their native
culture?
Well in one community just north of Cairns, the elders tried to clean up the alcohol
situation by closing the canteen except for extremely limited hours. Others in the
community then took the matter to court stating that their human rights had been
infringed by not allowing them to drink. Take it one way or the other, local issues
should be local issues, with wider governments setting down general rules.

The 3rd Imperium wouldn\'t even worry about issues like this. They lay down general
guidelines, and let the planet itself sort out the local citizenry. This prevents
the 3I gov from becoming involved wherever possible. It also shields them from the
backlash that inevitably comes when the winds of PC blow the other way.

   50 MCr - in actual private wealth: land, government debt instrument\'s,
                   stock\'s, precious metal\'s, etc.  Maybe 5 MCr is available
for
                   discrectionary spending, and of that, usually only 1 MCr
is
                   available for "active vacations".
   50 MCr - in a small yatch/courier starship, usually chartered out, used
as a
                   familly/corporate courier, or decked out to impress
businessmen.
                   However, for two month\'s of every year, it\'s available
for use
                   by the PC\'s for their "vacation".

The Imperium is so large and wealthy that this level of money is not even
noticed
by High Society, even in a backwater like the Spinward Marches.  Still,
it\'s enough to support regular adventuring, and even afford a few things
like
a mercenary platoon, constructing a base camp on an airless world, paying
for closely-held information/original research, or paying the entry cost\'s
of a
particular in-group.

Note that wealth in the 100\'s of MCr is noticable on a world in the mid-pop
level: these folk could be the richest folk on the planet, or number in at
least the
top 100. Their actions will be followed in such a small society, even if
only by
rumour.  This is doubly true if they are Imperial nobles, even if they are
only
knight\'s or a baronet.

Roleplaying wealth of the Billion\'s of credit\'s plus is not covered in my
post,
and would be difficult to roleplay: the PC\'s are too likely to disintergrate
into hedonsm or become pure political/financial roleplaying (aka little or
no action)
at that level of wealth [1].  I don\'t have Pocket Empires, but I have heard
of it:
it may help out in playing such people.

Regarding clique\'s: different group\'s often require different level\'s of
cost, and sometimes payment by different coin, too.  Being part of the Fifth
Frontier War
fraternity of veteran\'s requires different form\'s of payment - and gives you
different
benefit\'s - than being part of the Royal Explorer\'s Society, or the
Kitchener Group
of nobles, or the Stellar Cross of Christian activists.

Wealthy patron\'s will often form their own groups, which they can use to
meet their
own social goals.  These groups will cost good money and time, if you really
do
want the group to grow in influence and power.  Control of the group may be
taken
from the founder as it grows by a rival, or simply rip itself apart due to
personality
conflict\'s.

The most prestigous groups are groups of very powerful peer\'s: say, the
Amanda Network [2], composed of Dukes, which provides charity for selected
worthy causes (Serious money and time is expected by these groups,
and often there are noble prerequisite\'s as well.  As the Imperium is a
race-
conscious society, there may well be racial conditions as well, although the
Imperial dynasties has a tradition of ignoring such differences, and
everyone
want\'s to imitate the Emperor\'s tolerance, at least in High Society.

Anyway\'s Keeping Up Apperances can be a major drain of wealth for ambitious
PC\'s, despite their wealth.  This is especially true if they aspire to
upgrade their
station in life, and play the political game well.

From my understanding this is workable, a side effect would also shield the
occupants from NAS scanners as well. But personal psi shields would be
helmet like devices, which could have the visor with a blanking funtion to
prevent the EPW from seeing out.

Not a problem if you have good players. Before starting the campaign, just
decide what the rich characters mptivations will be, and make certain that
"getting richer" isn\'t on the list.

For example, a decade ago I played a noble in a Spinward Marches campaign.
He was a lot wealthier than all of the other players: personal yacht,
income from estates sufficient for upkeep plus staff, naval half-pay, TAS
membership... He was so rich, in fact, that I never bothered keeping track
of money except when he needed to carry cash. The campaign was fun,
though, because money just meant that the group could use decent equipment
and concentrate on what he thought was the real mission: tracking down and
deactivating all the nukes left over from the Fifth Frontier War. IIRC we
never actually found one, but the referee had us chasing over the Marches
following rumours, and generally taking every chance we had to do a good
deed (noblesse oblige and all that).

I\'ve also found, as a referee, that having clear non-monetary character
motivations and goals also tends to cut down on the "will do anything for
a credit" mentality.

I\'ve always taken the psi shielding in a helmet to mean that the wearer\'s mind 
can\'t be read.  Doesn\'t do a *thing* to prevent teleportation or telekinesis.

IMTU, to stop a tport from teleporting, you shoot him up with psi-stop.  Or 
knock him out and get him under cover someplace to where if he teleports out, 
he blows it bigtime.  Ever read \'The Stars My Destination\'?  Teeps IMTU have

teleport, unless they wanna teleport straight up.  <grin>

Tommy, I hope you\'re sitting down for this, but skyscrapers are not
"securely fastened to the ground". The shape of a skyscraper is itself
stable and does not need to be fastened to the ground or anything else to
stay up. In fact, some kinds of earthquake protection mount skyscrapers on
huge pads or frames which *are not even physically connected to the
ground*, someone like Superman could actually push them around like blocks
and they would stay up as long as the ground could support them. The reason
skyscrapers have those deep pilings and huge foundations is not to glue
them to the ground but to support their enormous weight. Without it they
would sink in the "solid" ground like it was sand.

 As for the center of mass moving outside the landing area, this is true
for anything; ships with parallel decks, perpendicular decks, vehicles,
people, animals, even rocks.  If a landing leg gives out, changing your
deck orientation is not going to rescue you. If this is going to be a
problem with exploratory ships it should not use landing legs.

But it should use decks perpendicular to thrust.

It it true and it is in the landing area. Take any of the standard starship
starship shapes, turn it to whatever orientation you want. Now draw lines
down from the outside of the shape and its centre of mass. The centre of
mass line will always lie inside the outer lines. The outer lines are the
landing area. Now you can make weird concave shapes where this is not true,
but for the standard starship shapes this will always be true.

Airplanes are the shape they are for other reasons than optimizing
stability and landing area. Their thrust and lift technologies are totally
different, their environment is different, their control and navigation
methods are different. I hope your smiley means you realize this, but if
not please send me private mail. This is far too large a subject to
summarize.

Second, airplanes do have problems with varying ship orientation, shifting
cargo, and the rest. Passengers need seatbelts and cargo must be secured
because of the way way aircraft operate.

Dear God, do I have to go through all this again? If you do not understand
this please send me private email so I don\'t keep going over the same
points repeatedly. If I made any mistakes I will post a synopsis to the
list.

>As long as the ship goes in a straight line this is true. When spining to

Depends what you mean by a "straight line". If you mean the ship only moves
in a straight line, then you are correct. If you mean the acceleration is
always in the same direction then you are incorrect. And a "straight line"
from the point of reference of someone inside the ship is the second one. A
ship turns while changing direction so the sum of external forces is always
in the same direction. A ship with decks perpendicular to the thrust axis
can fly corkscrews with *no* inertial compensation without changing the
direction of acceleration inside. You could put a bowling ball on the floor
and it wouldn\'t roll. A ship with decks parallel to the thrust axis cannot
do that, the bowling ball would begin to roll as soon as the ship moved.

>Again as long as there are no spinning or other non-thrust forces working
>on the ship.

Any ship rotation in combat or landing is so minor compared to the main
drive\'s acceleration that these forces will be negligible. If you mean
spinning the ship with forces comparable to the main thrust, like in a
centrifuge, then any ship with any deck orientation is in big trouble. The
ship may not even hold together.

>A ship with perpendicular decks is going to have a hard time
>going into any gravity field if the cargo is not securly fastened as it
>then needs to keep its aft pointed directly at the gravitating bodies
>center of mass, so doing any type of course changes is effectivly
>impossible.

Tommy, this is simply not true. A ship with perpendicular decks carrying a
bowling ball balanced on a thimble on the deck could take off, follow a
roller coaster track at 4 gees, spinning and flopping all over the place,
then land, on a 2 gee planet, with no inertial compensators, and if flown
precisely enough the bowling ball wouldn\'t budge because the direction of
the cumulative acceleration vectors would not change. This is physically
impossible on a ship with parallel decks.

If you don\'t believe this please study a physics textbook first. I don\'t

So build the cargo deck close to the ground. True, you can\'t do that with a
needle or wedge configurations, so use a disk or slab.

It is also possible that ships with parallel decks may be cheaper to

construction _can_ be done from inside the ship but this makes it harder

Actually, ease-of-access is a reasonably good reason for designing decks
parallel. It\'s a _lot_ easier (and faster) to walk down a corridor than to
climb a ladder. This is a pretty decent reason for having corridors,
especially in smaller ships.

As for combat, assuming that the ship can manage more than 1G, few
crewmembers will be travelling unaided anyway. 

(I\'d still put the bridge at the centre of the ship, though.)

Since the question is specifically aimed at me, and on the list, I\'ll have
to answer it. I have otherwise stopped sending mail on this topic to the
list (although I will carry on conversations on private mail if asked to).

The question then...

No, I would not fight and die for anything, at least not now. The answer
might change if I, for example, get married or have kids. You might call
me a coward and an egoist, but I more figure myself a realist. This point
of view has to do with my complete lack of belief in any form of
afterlife. I believe that if I am dead, nothing at all will ever matter to
me anymore. In the words of T. Pratchet:

"Ideas are not worth dying for, they are worth living for."

Probably one of the most serious quotes possible from HIS books ;-)

I think you have your terms swapped; ships with decks perpendicular to main
engine thrust are still safe and usable even if contragrav and inertial
compensators didn\'t exist; parallel decks and thrust are unusable without
them.

Even if contragrav and internal compensators were totally reliable, never
failed, and used no power, it is still economically unsound to use
spaceships with parallel decks and thrust axes for the reasons I have
already gone into detail for.

Yup, swapped my terms, sorry.

Now let\'s see your deckplan for a small, streamlined cargo vessel that
allows drive-on/drive-off cargo loading like a 400tn subsidized merchant,
without using decks parallel to main engine thrust.

I agree. In Traveller, they have the technology to build starships with
parallel decks and thrust, even though there is no need. Airplanes aren\'t
equipped with high-altitude emergency escapes because the cost/benefit
ratio is near zero. Parallel decks and thrust have a high cost and no
benefit at all, in fact they are disadvantageous.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
As for "benefits near zero":
With our current tech, a fighter pilot can survive almost any aircraft
failure short of a direct missile hit on the cockpit. If we dressed all
airplane passengers in flight suits with backup oxygen tanks and 
strapped them into automated ejection seats, we\'d have had survivors
from the Lockerbie crash and from the TWA that went down south of
Long Island.
Once upon a time, all aircraft were required to have enough 
parachutes on board for everyone.

As for "high cost":
Most Traveller spacecraft are built with artificial grav and inertial comp
anyway. If you have these systems, and trust them so much that
you think they\'ll never fail, you can put your decks upside down or
sideways if that suits you.

(Example: the CT Lab Ship has decks parallel to thrust, oriented
with feet down towards the outer hull - so you can turn off the
artificial grav and spin the ship, eliminating artificial gravity fields
as a extraneous variable in your research.)

Once you have a situation where inertial comp and arti-grav are
standard, included costs on a starship, any even minimally
advantageous deck orientation can be used - such as "airplane style"
layouts for ease in cargo transfer or easy accessibility for ground
crew.

Richard again:

Richard, you _are_ aware that skyscrapers have massive below-ground
support structures, without which they _would_ fall down, right?

A 70-meter long ship will be far more stable on it\'s side, sitting on

But still they are much more fastened to the ground than a ship landing on
legs, and is not really a good example of the topic in this discussion.

The point was that it is more likly for a ship with perpendicular decks to
by high, and should these fall over the damage is going to be much more
extensive. A ship with parallelle decks will fall maksimum a few meters to
the ground, while a needle ship with perpendicular decks can fall 20 - 30
meters before hiting the ground.

Calm down, dear sir. All I have seen so far as a good and solid argument
for perpendicular decks are the gravity issue. As someone else pointed
out, the cargo access problem is something that makes the parallelle decks
best. So I think you\'ll se both in the Imperium.

I\'m not following this (might be because I can\'t visualize it properly),
but it seems to me that the bowling ball is affected by two forces, the
normal force from the deck and the gravity force from the planet. Now
direction of the force from the planet is going to change rapidly if the
ship makes any manouvers. Why doesn\'t this make the ball move around? The
only way to keep the ball from not moving it to keep the normal force from
the deck pointing the opposite way of gravity force.

Im not talking about properties of acceleration in space, but the effect

But if the decks are perpendicular to the thrust axis and we assume that
the thrusters have to stay in the aft of the ship (most ships have the
jump drive there to), the cargo decks on a "landing craft" has to removed
away from aft. A ship with perpendicular decks always has to land with its
aft towards the ground, so the cargo is some height up from the ground.

Yup. When the World Trade Center sways ten meters off-line in
a wind, it\'s just the shape of the building that brings it back on-line.
The foundations have nothing to do with it. <g>

Rich, skyscrapers are stable as long as nothing happens to them.
Even the earthquake-proofing you mention (movable foundations)
have friction resistance and stop-blocks that limit how far 
the foundation can move, and what forces it will take to move it.

Well, no. If the thrust is always perpendicular to the decks, the ship

Huh? All I am saying is that things like poison gas dispensers and
bioscanners are hardware, and must be purchased and installed separately
from software. If your software "anticipates" hardware that isn\'t there it
certainly will be of no use at all.

Anti-hijack is a MCr 0.1 computer program, and if buying a copy suddenly
makes hardware appear all over your multi-kiloton spacecraft this will
unbalance the game.

"Software Anticipate the Hardware" - Windows 95 has the drivers for
soundcards, CD-ROMs, network cards, etc. It\'s ready for you when you
buy compatible hardware, the hardware doesn\'t come with it.

If you buy Anti-Hijack without any hardware, it probably just acts
as a monitoring program - tells you that something in the cargo bay is
using up oxygen, for example, and tells you that the usage is
commensurate with five guys hiding in a cargo crate.

I\'d imagine retina scanners, keypads and such being marketed in the
Imperium as "Designed for Anti-Hijack 1110" (or whatever).

Have anybody wondered the prices of Raw Materials in TNE and World Tamer\'s
Handbook (WTH for now on)?  I just calculated that one metric tonne of Raw
Material costs Cr200.0 (WTH p.35, divide metric tonnes by 20 to get
displacement tons, which cost Cr4000).
	That would be ok, but in the Agricultural Sector one \'unit\' needs 10 metric
tonnes of RM (at TL-9) to produce 33 rations. One ration is priced at Cr40
(again, WTH p.35), thus total value of output is Cr1320, when RM need is
Cr4000!?
	In the Industrial sector, it is even worse. One \'unit\' needs 55 metric
tonnes of RM (at TL-9) to produce Cr2000. So input cost is Cr11,000, not to
mention Heavy industry!
	And there are also transporting costs, handling costs, labor salaries (in
Free Market economy, which I\'m modelling), maintenance costs, etc.
	So how come? Any solutions?

And as I stated earlier, it is extremely difficult to come up with a more
accessible ship layout than the traditional free/fat/far trader layout,
with fewer, larger decks.  The "skyscraper" stacking of decks works with
the AHL class of ships (and others of significantly large tonnages) because
the individual decks are large enough to be laid out without wasting a lot
of space (just look how many lifts and vertical access shafts the AHL class
has).  This technique just doesn\'t fly with most hull configurations in the
<1,000 ton range.

Bulk transport between worlds is most efficiently done with large ships.
The Mergon-class, first built by Dajkoi Shipyards in -52, have proven
admirably suited to their task. Lacking all defenses, indeed beling little
more than a frame with engines, a lifepod, and cargo holds, the Mergon is
suitable only for Inner Sphere worlds, where Imperial Naval protection can
be taken for granted.

As is usual for open-frame ships, the Mergon class includes attachments
allowing cargo pods to be aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the
axis of thrust. Experienced shipped know that paying off the Dockers Guild
makes more difference to the safety of their cargo, anyway. :-)

Before MT was released, I was involved in a campaign where the PC\'s were
involved in diplomatic contacts between the Zho\'s and the Solomani.  The
main topic was the "Imperial Menace."  It ran for a few years, and was
rather interesting.  My character, the head of the Zho group, never quite
understood why the Solomani called him "Yassir"...

Add a pod centered on either side.
One pod is the engineering pod and contains power-plant, jump-drive and
half the thrusters as well as tools, spares and EVA equipment.
The other pod is the crew pod and contains flight and docking bridges, crew
quarters, life support and half the thrusters.
Fuel is stored in waste space in the central cylinder and/or in saddle tanks.

Assume that there are eight thruster plates in total. The outer two plates
on each side are fitted to swivel 15 degrees out (along long axis) within a
rigid force transmission cage. This provides gross manuvering thrust in a
gravity well. Delicate two-axis horizontal manuvers and twisting are
managed with verniers. The ship takes off and lands vertically like and
jump jet or helicopter.

This gives you a low cargo deck design with decks perpendicular to thrust.
The basic design is also scalable and very versatile.
The main bay (cylinder) can be left clear for the transport of bulky cargo
(e.g., other vehicles). Or it can be divided into two (or more) decks for
the efficient transport of container cargo. Hinge one end of the cylinder
and include an overhead track which extends beyond the deckplate and you
have integral cargo handling capabilities.
The main bay can also be configured to haul liquid gases. Or divided into
an upper deck for passengers and a lower cargo deck. In this configuration
the upper deck would contain cabins and lounges as well as life support and
escape equipment; everything for the care and feeding of passengers.

Entry of an atmosphere will always be turbulent. I envision passengers
packing their bags before entry, leaving their luggage in the loading lock
and gathering in the lounge where the recliners double as shock couches.
Strapped in they ride from orbit to landing, and do not move around the
cabin until the spacecraft has come to a complete stop :-)

If any of this seems familiar, i simply replaced the wings of an airpane
with pods. Passenger and cargo plane have decks perpendicular to lift. The
lift is transferred to the body of the plane at the wing roots.

Yes, this was mentioned quite a while ago. IIRC someone even had decks
plans for a disk-shaped craft with decks perpendicular to thrust posted on
their web page; it flies like a thrown pie.

The FF&S rules do not have an upper limit to size based on streamlining
option, nor does real life IMHO. You could make a flat sheet a kilometer
across that face-forward flies at supersonic speeds. This would be a very
inefficient design since it would lose a lot of energy to eddies, but it
could be done.

I don\'t follow this exactly; my posts have been about ships with decks
perpendicular to the *ship\'s thrust axis*, which need have nothing to do
with their orientation relative to the "ground". Most ships with decks
perpendicular to the thrust axis will in fact be parallel to the ground, so
if this is what you mean your premise is false.

If you mean a ship with a needle or wedge configuration with decks parallel
to their thrust axis will have fewer decks than one with a perpendicular
thrust axis, then you are correct. I have no idea what the relative
proportions of hull types are in YTU.

>Therefore they will have more wasted space &
>less usefull interior space than ships laid our parallel to the ground.

This does not follow from either of your premises. Why is a cubic metre of
elevator "less useful" than one of corridor? Published deck plans show
elevators and ladders inside corridors, so they certainly don\'t need any
more space.

If you absolutely need long empty corridors in your needle ship, run it the
length of the spine and use gravity compensators to let passengers walk
"up" it. They can use a semicircular ramp to leave the ship or walk onto
decks. Ridiculous? Personally, I would never use it,  but you realize this
is exactly the sort of arrangement the parallel deck-crowd requires *every
time the ship moves*. If they are allowed to claim the designers are so
confident in their grav technology they never even consider it failing, why
can\'t I? Especially when it\'s only used when the ship is landing?

Not necessarily true, and if you have a case where it is and it\'s
important, design the ship with 1 (one) perpendicular deck. Not a lot of
elevators or ladders there...

>It is also possible that ships with parallel decks may be cheaper to

Sure it\'s possible, if you design a ship that way. It\'s possible no matter
what the deck orientation is. If it\'s that big a deal don\'t design the ship
that way!

Strange that people in skyscrapers, which have perpendicular "decks" can
get around faster than those in airports, which have parallel "decks".
Seriously, though, if this is an important design goal then design a ship
with decks perpendicular to thrust that has corridors instead of ladders.

Personally, I would design a ship with the rooms connected directly with
elevators and *no* corridors. It\'s a lot easier (and faster) to not move at
all than walk down a corridor. But, you could do this with any deck
orientation so the point is largely irrelevant.

Not true. The type S scout/courier is a lot wider than a single cabin;
there is plenty of room for many cabins on each deck.

And even if there weren\'t, so what? Ships already have elevators and
ladders, by stacking rooms on top of each other we could get rid of all
those space-wasting corridors.

I, too, would like to see a scout/courier with such a layout. I\'ll put that

  South-Western British Columbia is a fairly high-risk earthquake zone.
The typical "piles driven to bedrock" has been replaced in some advanced
designs by "building sitting on rollers mounted in conecrete tray lying
on piles and/or bedrock". I very much doubt that these buildings are
anticipated to fall over in high winds - unless perhaps it\'s the blast
from a passing near-c roc :)

Well, not quite. I am going to try and run a campaign in which both the
Zho\'s and the Imperium are forces to be reconned with, not necessarily
in a confrontational way, but then who knows.  Anyone who has run a
campaign with an alternate society outside the Imperium will have had
the same or similar problems IMO.

Subject: Re: Starships in GURPS Traveller (Bonds and Stocks)

<snippo GURPS specific information...>

Buying a starship isn\'t like buying a car.  You\'d need a sound business
plan to convince the banker you could earn the money to repay the loan and
a reputation sound enough to convince him you wouldn\'t skip.  Given that
you could convince a banker of your ability (and willingness) to repay it
you could borrow *any* amount of money.

You can sell bonds with NO solid assets to back them, you can sell penny
stocks on thin air and promises if you can convince suckers...err, I mean
investors to buy them.  Just how to arrange that as part of character
generation...I don\'t know.

Maybe it *shouldn\'t* be a part of chargen, even if Traveller has always
done it that way.

As a specific example, in the PBEM I\'m running the group is getting a ship
as part of the plot setup, not character generation.  I\'m using an
inheritance to "gift" them the ship, *but* they are going to have to
finance its repair and refit, and find money to operate it...they don\'t
know that part yet.  ;-> They will get to know some brokers and bankers
really well before they get the Mae Lee off the tarmac.

>>b)  Shares.  A loan can be taken out by a group of people, rather than
just

>Small, but important point:  shares are (generally) shares of _equity_ -

Right, I noticed that when I read it too.  I think we\'re talking about
selling bonds here rather than stock.  All bonds are a promise to make
specified payments at specified times with legal remedies *often* (not
always) provided in the event of default. Some information...

Mortgage Bonds are secured by the pledge of a specific property.  In the
event of default the bondholders are entitled to obtain the property in
question through bankruptcy proceedings.

Equipment Obligation Bonds (sometimes known as equipment trust
certificates) are secured by specific pieces of equipment -- railroad
rolling stock, commercial aircraft, ships and the like.  The equipment
should be readily salable and easily transferred to a new owner. Generally,
a trustee holds the title to the equipment, issues the bonds and leases the
equipment to the using corporation.  Money received from the corporation is
used to make interest and principal payments to the bond holders.  If/when
all payments are made the corporation takes title to the equipment.  If it
fails to make payments it loses its lease and the trustee can resell the
asset and pay off the bond holders.

Debenture Bonds are general obligations of the issuing corporation and
therefore represent *unsecured* credit.  To protect the bond holders the
indenture (the issuing corporation) will usually limit the amount of debt
it issues.  Failure to make the specified payments is grounds for
bankruptcy proceedings.

Subordinated Debentures are debentures issued secondarily to an initial
placement.  In the event of default they will be satisfied *after*
debenture, equipment and mortgage backed bonds.

There are even Voting Bonds, like regular bonds, but giving the holder a
say in the management of the corporation.  Not too common, but a
possibility.

Then there is Preferred Stock.  Preferred stock is like a perpetual bond.
A set amount is paid to the holder each year, stated as a percent of the
stock\'s par value or a direct dollar amount.  Because this security is a
stock, payments are dividends instead of interest, and thus don\'t qualify
as an expense when computing the corporation\'s income tax. OTOH, failure to
make payment doesn\'t constitute grounds for bankruptcy proceedings, like it
does with a true bond.

Common Stock represent equity (ownership) in a corporation.
A stock holds a residual claim, meaning that creditors and preferred
stockholders must be paid as scheduled before common stockholders can
receive any payments.  In bankruptcy, equity holders are entitled to any
value left after *all* creditors have been satisfied.  Common stock has a
limited liability, you can lose all the money you invested but no more.
OTOH, if the corporation makes money a stockholder shares in the increase
in equity of the company.  Because stockholders *own* the corporation they
have voting privileges and may participate in the management of the
corporation within the limits imposed by the corporate charter.

I don\'t know how much this helps in the discussion, but I thought I\'d pass
the information along.

It\'s possible - nay, certain - that the MegaCorps have their

Preferred Stock - nice, regular dividend payment\'s.  A good way to obtain
                             fund\'s without actually *working* for a living.

Common Stock - yes, you own a chunk of a business.  Hopefully, if this

                              the stockholders to claim (after other

______________________

"She blinded me... with SCIENCE!" - ancient in-joke
among Scout\'s: so old, It Must Be Vilani.
______________________

The Imperial Honour Code probably has more to do with solid
Sylean business ethic\'s and Vilani cultural tradition than
with Christian chivary and belief\'s.  Traveller documentation stresses
that Honour is the only available basis to govern such a sprawling
entity as the Third Imperium: many on this list are also aware
of the need for honour in the military setting, as well.

Without knowledge of the actual truth of what\'s going on,
there is no way a correct Imperial decision can be made.
If the Emperor must spend all of his time watching his back,
he cannot spend the needed time or effort to pursue long-term
objectives.   High military expendetures to put down rebellion\'s
and treasonous uprisings at the other side of the Imperium
mean a cramped economy: continous military expendeture
above 10% of total GNP will slowly kill an economy.

Note that the Imperium exist only for economic reason\'s: there is
no universal shared religion, no single racial group or a universal
military enemy to unite the Imperium, only trade.  [1] If there isn\'t
enough trust for Solomani Rim corporations to invest in a
venture in Lishun sector, then the Imperium is dead.  The Second
Imperium died for almost exactly this reason.

In order for this trust to exist, there must be Honour, some
shared reverance for the Truth.  With this trust, great wealth
can be gained: the Colonial Quaker\'s got wealthy specifically
because they had earned a reputation as being very trustworthy.

Now, most nobles are pagan\'s: this implies - among other thing\'s -
that they probably do NOT believe that there is such a thing as
an objective, rational, immutable truth that exist\'s "out there".
It\'s possible (following certain form\'s of Greek philosophy), but
unlikely.

That doesn\'t necessarily mean that Imperial Nobility are so foolish
as to agree with the modern secularist that truth is fundamentally
nothing but a social construct, an act of imagination.

However, the Imperial Nobility generally do behave in a Machivellian
way, using the truth when it\'s useful, and ignoring it when it isn\'t.
All nobles use deceit as part of their daily operations,
but their justification\'s and goal\'s differ.  Observe the actions of
Dulinor, Norris, Lucan, and Strephon for their justifications and
the result of their actions.

It should be noted, however, the Nobility generally do try to work in
the best interest\'s of their people, all of the fraction leaders - Dulinor,
Norris, Strephon, Bzrk, Ishuggi [2], Margret, and Craig - all genuinely
thought that they were working in the best interest\'s of their people.
So did the Archdukes that declaired fealty to Lucan [3]; only Lucan
himself was the exception.

By their action\'s, the nobility showed that they valued love of and
for their people over their obligation as lieges of the Emperor.
Love over Honour. Love over Duty. Love over Truth.

Yep, it\'s that old Christian influence again....  who else places the
power of love on such a pedestal?  However, even though
God did love his Son, that Son still died, writhing naked on
a wooden Roman cross for the salvation of the world.  In the end,
the Christian concept of love does not negate Honour, Duty or Truth :
it simply provides an escape from eternal hell.

So, should the Archdukes shown feality to Lucan?  Not until
he was declared the legitimate successor to Strephon by the moot
(or if the Nobility vote to dissolve the Imperium). Until then, neither the
Archdukes nor the Imperial Navy need obey Prince Lucan\'s orders.
The chain of command stop\'s at the Archduchy/Grand Admiral
level, and stay\'s there until a new Emperor is chosen. (or if no Emperor
can be chosen immediately, a temporary Regent).  Certainly, no major
military offensive or session movement is permitted.

Even so, there are still the question as to the duties a noble owe\'s to
those under him.  Does the honour code only cover nobility and the military,
or all subject\'s of the Imperium?  Is it negated on a member world? Is it a
strictly military and noble code?  What are it\'s applications in the
business sphere?
Who defined what is honourable, and what is not? [4]

[1] Apparently, the Third Imperium doesn\'t even have the moral substance of
the Roman Empire:

Rome had a statement of purpose: "to protect the weak and make humble the
proud." The Roman republic, and later the empire, may not always have
adhered to that purpose, but few doubted that was the ideal policy. The
business of Rome, the superpower, was the imposition of order on a
disorderly world.

Yeppers, right now I am running a game in which a very high tech civ (TL:
20) with Psi is right between the Zho, Imps, Vargar & Aslan...  The Zho are
trying to get them to join up as they are both places where the nobles are
all PSIs...  The Imps are trying to say that if you join us we will be your
friends while at the same time keeping a couple of fleets well within
striking range...  The Aslan are just Raidng them...  And the Vargar
worship them, they think they are the Ancients...

from the TV series "Lost in Space". Takeoff and landing are as shown on the
series, but the lateral motion without changing the ship\'s orientation is
strictly "TV science".

This is true of any deck orientation. Perpendicular decks just don\'t
*require* it. And, they can accelerate at one more G in space than ships
with parallel decks and the same inertial compensation, require less
landing and takeoff area, have less shifting of cargo due to lateral
forces, do not require separate thrusters for takeoff, can hover without
contragrav, have a reaction drive danger zone that doesn\'t move around and
is smaller than the parallel deck ships\'s, which would blanket the entire
the entire launch area, by the way, and aren\'t required to maintain
stability through a rotation of 90 degrees.

Sure, you can come up with weird designs or mission requirements or
engineering fixes to work around one or two of these constraints, but all
of them at once? And with absolutely no extra cost? Starships with parallel
decks and thrust axes belong in the same category as those that use rudders
in space, IMHO.

*Heavy sigh* No Walt, astonishing as it may seem, they would not fall down.
They would sink, though. If you can\'t believe this, please read "Why
Buildings Stand Up" by Mario Salvadori, ISBN 0-393-30676-3, and argue with
him.

If this is such an overriding design goal then don\'t design it as a 70 m
needle! But it can be plenty stable enough on its tail.

I don\'t think you appreciate how stable tall, thin structures like
skyscrapers can be built, or how much lateral force is required to topple
one. You may be comparing it to a pile of blocks or a lego tower which can
be knocked over with a simple push, but this is misleading. When the first
skyscrapers were built, people didn\'t believe they could stand up. But
they, and even taller ones today,  do.

Towers become *more* stable as they scale up; try balancing a pencil on
end, then a shipping tube for a comparison. And something the size of a
building or starship can be built very stable. Remember that earthquake in
Mexico a few years back? Skyscrapers remained standing while older squat
building around them collapsed. I\'m not saying that squat buildings
couldn\'t be designed just as stable, only that tall thin ones are not going
to topple just because the ground shifts underneath them.

Moreover, they are in positive equilibrium. If a gust of wind, an
earthquake, or Superman gives one a big push it will actually *tilt back*
into an upright position. The force required to topple one is comparable to
that required to lift it off the ground. This is another reason why
people\'s experiences with things like towers of playing cards or lego is
not appropriate.

And frankly, these are all rather artificial examples. If remaining stable
through nuclear-scale lateral forces or landing pads that pitch through 45
degrees is a consideration, then build it with decks perpendicular to the
thrust axis but not a needle configuration. I honestly think you\'re
creating straw man arguements for parallel deck orientations.

4.  Ships depreciate based on a combination of age, condition, design,

both of the same age and general condition).

Your thoughts?

Yes, there is a very limited upgrade path.  I would prefer something more 
granular, however.  Why is it that the same software that is used to target 
and fire the pulse laser is used for missiles?  How about the KKD that are 
so popular on the list?  I am aware that it is for simplicities sake, what 
I am proposing is a much more involved system that can fit in side by side 
with the existing one.  Then, if a GM wishes to utilize it, it is 
available.

If a skilled hijacker wants the ship, he\'s going to get it.  The A/H

hmmmm...perhaps I should make something clear.  IMTU, most automated 
systems run under the \'3 laws\' put forth by Dr. Asimov.  Specifically 
excluded from this are combat and security \'droids, and the A/H software 
overrides it under very specific circumstances.  Even if the crew wanted 
to, they should not be able to turn their ship into a death trap.  However, 
areas that are considered uninhabited (i.e. the \'tween deck areas) but 
allow access to vital controls necessary to command the ship, and those 
areas vital to ship\'s function (bridge and engineering) should be able to 
be defended with deadly force, do you agree?

No, but I fly on planes with armored cockpit doors.  And on airlines that 
have, on occiasion, been know to put armed, non-uniformed personnel on the 
aircraft to prevent hijackings.

It\'s pretty standard to write \'hooks\' into commercial software to support 
future upgrades, even if the programmer doesn\'t know exactly what those 
upgrades will be while coding the original software.

I don\'t know about your TU, but I make the players in mine pay for 
everything.  I\'m not talking about expanding the capabilities of the 
software, I\'m talking upgrade pathes.  Expensive ones, if I have my way!

No, skyscrapers are not necessarily any more "fastened to the ground" than
a ship, or a rock for that matter. In fact, a ship with landing clamps may
even be fastened more securely. A skyscraper could simply rest on the
ground with nothing physically holding it there and be perfectly stable
(assuming the ground is strong enough to hold it up).

I think skyscrapers are a good analogy because they show a real-world
example of something which:

1. Has "decks" perpendicular to their "thrust axis" (OK, gravity in this case).

2. Is a safe and efficient needle configuration, which the parallel-deck
crowd (PDC) seems to think is some kind of worst-case scenario.

3. Is perfectly stable, able to stand up in hurricanes and earthquakes,
despite the claims of the PDC that a vehicle merely six times its width in
height would "blow over in a breeze".

3. Uses elevators and stairways without the occupants pining for mile-long
corridors.

4. Provides a useful visual image for those who think a spacecraft is a
kind of airplane, with the same design constraints that an airplane has.

5. Actually has the same physical structure as some kinds of canon
Traveller spacecraft, like the Azanti High Lightning.

The forces required to topple a large tall structure may be more than you
expect. A needle ship with parallel decks hit with enough force to topple
one with perpendicular decks will probably do enough damage to make the
fall moot (IMHO, it would be hard to calculate this).

If you build ships prone to falling over then don\'t build one in this
configuration. I\'m not trying to cop out, I feel a lot of these complaints
are of the form "yeah, but I can build a ship with perpendicular decks that
has a really inappropriate design...". You can build a bad design of
anything. The advantages of perpendicular decks are in its basic physical
properties, not an individual design. A needle configuration is better for
some situations and worse for others.

Actually, you *could* build a needle or wedge ship with perpendicular decks
which lies flat on the ground; just put the main drive in the ship\'s belly.
It might wobble, depending on things like cargo distribution, and might
have some weird gyroscopic effect when rotating in combat, but its
perfectly workable. Perhaps there would be a market on planets which think
spaceships have to fly like airplanes...

If you see having to use cranes or elevators to load cargo as a "problem",
then you should use short squat ships with perpendicular decks. Ships with
parallel decks have no advantage in this situation, or any other, at all.

Well, it is affected by three forces: gravity, the normal force from the
deck, and acceleration due to the main engine. However, the vector result
of these two forces is a third force in a third direction. The ball doesn\'t
move around because you direct the main thrust at an angle so that the
resultant main thrust and external gravity vector is normal to the ship
deck. That\'s why the bowling ball doesn\'t move, in fact it is held to the
deck even harder!

OK, I am fudging a little here because I\'m assuming you have some way of
changing the ship\'s orientation to point the main engines in the right
direction without causing significant centrifugal effects or lateral
acceleration. To a first approximation, this force is insignificant
compared to the external forces. Maybe the main engine is on gimbals or
something...

The point is that you swivel the main engines to provide a thrust
counteracting external accelerations, *and the deck swivels along with it*.
The main thrust has to be directed in a way that "balances" the external
forces or the ship will go off course. And since the decks are
perpendicular to the main thrust this balancing force will be (to a first
approximation) normal to the decks. The cumulative effect of all this
maneuvering to the bowling ball is that acceleration toward the deck
changes in intensity, but not direction

Sure it does, but it doesn\'t take up any more space. Look at the old scout
and free trader, they have engines on the lower decks and still have space
for cargo. A ship with perpendicular decks can do the same thing. In fact,
you can convert the old free trader and scout deck plans to a perpendicular
deck orientation simply by moving the engines from the aft of the ship to
under the center of gravity. The engines don\'t get bigger, cargo space
doesn\'t get smaller, you just have to move it a bit.

>A ship with perpendicular decks always has to land with its
>aft towards the ground, so the cargo is some height up from the ground.

This does not follow at all. Why would you move the cargo up higher? In
fact, there may be *more* room for cargo on the bottom deck; if you assume
the main engines have to be longer in their direction of thrust, like a
rocket, then the engines would be put "up on end" and take *less* space on
the bottom deck that the existing free trader and scout plans!

I think you may be getting carried away with the example of a needle
configuration; I use it solely because the PDC seem to think it is some
kind of physical impossibility. Certainly, it will have a smaller
"footprint" that the same configuration with a parallel deck orientation,
and this *may* make it less suitable for low-tech cargo. So use a different
configuration. The canon scout and far traders are not needles so this is a
moot arguement, IMHO.

To clarify, if you can convince the lender that you can and will
repay an amount of money with a favorable rate of return for them,
they will lend the money to you.  Having a sound business plan goes
a long way to convincing the banker.  Being glib, highly

Here I\'m referring to mustering out benefits providing ships to

<snip>

First, Bruce, Craig, Keven, Tim, Suz, Terry, and James....you
*didn\'t* read that part about the game you\'re in, and if you did,
you immediately *forgot* it!!!!  Right?  ;->

Second, I hope ya\'ll found my article about financial arrangements
useful.  People were posting back and forth about stocks and
bonds...and not getting it quite right...so, I thought I\'d try to
clear things up a little and to give a few RW options for financing
that people might not have considered.

This all came from a GURPSNET discussion we were having about PC
groups having access to multi-million dollar (credit ;-) ships, but
not all being insanely wealthy.  The general thrust of my posts was
that ships for PC groups *should* be part of the game\'s plot, not
*just* a character generation event.  Acquiring ships, getting them
into working condition, and keeping them should be a continuing part
of a campaign, if at all possible.

Yes, ship mustering out benefits are part of Traveller and should
continue to be, but rather than making acquisition of a ship a sure
thing they should simply make it easier for a character/group to get
the ship (and/or get a better ship).  The players should still have
to roleplay:  convincing of backers to lend them money, arranging
the loans with the grey men, problems with contractors they are
hiring to get/keep ships in good shape, and finding of ways to make
their payments...and maybe a profit.  Their "ship benefits" should
just give them a GM-administered edge in getting and keeping their
ship, but not the ship itself.

This applies to Merchant Ships, of course, Scout and Lab ships are a
slightly different matter.  And this is all IMTU.  I *do* think it
makes sense in all TU\'s, but that\'s still just my opinion.

    still a heretic

So, use the exact same layout, just with a perpendicular deck orientation.
All you have to do is move the engines from the aft end of the ship to the
center. You don\'t have to change the statistics, the cargo handling, or
even the deck plans very much.

If you like fewer, larger decks, then make a ship with *one* single large
flat deck and a main drive perpendicular to the deck right through the
center of gravity. Hell, hold the deck to the hull with hydraulics and
*lower the whole thing to the ground* for landing; passengers could drive
right into their staterooms! Would that make you happy?

Every shape available to ships with parallel deck orientations are
available to those with perpendicular orientations. There is no requirement
to put the cargo holds up on the 30th floor unless for some reason you want
to.

I\'m almost afraid to ask how stacking decks wastes a lot of space for fear
of prolonging this thread any more, but how will it? Take your favorite
deck plan. Move the engine to under the center of gravity so the thrust
\'goes out\' the bottom of the ship. You now have a ship with decks
perpendicular to the thrust axis. Have fun with all your free Gs of
inertial compensation and don\'t bother fastening your seatbelts when you
land or take off, but first tell me what has disappeared into "waste space"?

As for all those "lifts and vertical access shafts" in the AHL et al; you
have to be able to travel from one end of a ship to the other whatever the
size or deck orientation. If it used a parallel orientation it would just
have to be corridors instead of elevators. You still have to be able to
travel through corridors so it\'s not like you can fill them up with cargo
or something. This is true no matter what the ship size so I don\'t know
what happens at < 1000 dtons to make this configuration "not fly".

And again, if you don\'t like needle configuration then *don\'t use it*. The
"traditional free/fat/far trader layout" doesn\'t.

Any and all the above.  

IMTU and from an in-game character viewpoint...

If the political entity taxes depreciable property (like ships) it
usually does so based on the property\'s worth as depreciated, using
some set rate.  I usually use straight line for simplicty, but there
are a lot of other possiblities.  This depreciation rate doesn\'t
relate directly to the actual utility of the ship, just its taxable
worth.  An asset can be reduced to 0 taxable worth, but still
generating income for the owner because it still has an economic
utility.

Generally, the actual worth of a ship is what other people would pay
for it.  Ship Brokers, and Appraisers hired by bankers, brokers, and
buyers, evaluate the ship and set a "fair market value" based on the
ship\'s age, condition, design, etc.  There can be wide variations in
these apprasials...game material here folks. 

...from a game mechanic viewpoint...

I use this depreciation method for merchant ships.

Base depreciation under normal use with regular maintenance:

 1.  During the first 10 years the ship drops 3 to 5% in resale
     value from its initial value each year.  I like to get the
     value down to about 60% by the 10th year. 
         
 2.  During the years 11 through 50 the ship\'s resale value goes
     down by around 1% per year.  At 50 years a ship should be down
     to about 20%.
     
 3.  After 50 years the ship doesn\'t normally lose value from normal
     use.

 * If the ship misses it\'s regular maintenance the loss in value from
   that year is doubled (after 50 years it\'s 1%).

 * If the ship is damaged it loses value at the GM\'s option.

 * Ship overhauls and upgrades increase value.
  
 * If the ship is being evaluated at a TL other than at which it was
   manufactured the value will set higher or lower at the GM\'s
   option.
 
I admit to "winging a lot of it."  ;->

Yatch?

The only Yatch I know of was published in The Traveller Chronicle #3. All the
rest are Yachts...
 (Kevin Knight and I had a good laugh over that one when the issue first
appeared; seems he hadn\'t noticed it until I pointed it out... in the issue I
received in the mail as part of my subscription.)

Strictly speaking we don\'t know enough bout Longbow or the EW.  RSB itself

Hmm... It won\'t give you the ref\'s section, but you can get the Planet III

As I know, teleportation over a planet\'s distance is impossible.
So, if the Prison Camp is located on a world with only one starport, which
ist rigorosly controlled and even a secret for the PoWs, there ought to be
little chance for them to escape. They need to know where to go before
teleporting.

There are also implications in teleporting far distances around a world,
as velocity vectors stay unchanged whilst teleport. You NEVER can teleport
to the backside of a world without losing your health - or better life.
Also you cannot teleport to an orbital station or shuttle, as the change
of gravity decreases your potential energy, which must be converted from
body heat ... (explained in one the modules, don\'t know which)

It is easier to imprison teleporters than you think.

I do not think that EVERYTHING possible can be acheived at TL 14, not even
in psionics. I\'d vote for a TL psionics chart, as this is adopted as a 
science to the Trav universe. This could include also tech using
psi-switches (so-called \'flickers\'). I also wonder if the Zho\'s have
psionically rigged vehicles like the Z-80 Grav tank.

10-12: psionic switches; booster drug
13-15: psi-engineering and telepathic virtual reality
16 and beyond: psi-driven devices, psionic memories -> ancient artifacts

Perhaps we can refine this chart, but I think it would be wise to use
psionics as another science. This would also mean, Psi Institutes have to
provide a certain TL for their activities.

Just an idea.

Or else we change the shape for the smaller ships. More of a "flying

Now that I have a CAD program, I may try this. :-)

They won\'t have a problem is the ship has compensators adequate for the
acceleration. If they don\'t, or the comps are out, they can\'t travel at
*all* in the "decks parallel to thrust" layout.

For all the good it does in a ship where the "center" isn\'t that far
from the surface. :-)

Since we\'ve pretty much assumed containerized cargo, you can easily
unload almost anywhere. The ship\'s cargo handling system would just
feed things out a hatch near the ground. And you\'d have stuff "racked"
in the hold, so as to avoid stacking limits on containers.

Asides from some fighters and aerobatic stunt planes, we don\'t have to

that\'s gonna make it to orbit economically *has* to have a thrust much

Unlike aircraft, ships when turning *still* have the main thrust in the
same direction *relative to the ship*. That\'s because the steering
thrusters will turn the ship about it\'s center of mass at a rate
that\'ll give a quite *minor* acceleration, while the mian drive keeps
right on pushing.

Hardly. It has to point the engines at the planet for landing and
takeoff *anyway*. And only *minor* side thrusts are needed to stay on
course until it\'s in orbit. 

You just *aren\'t* going to get the sort of major side thrusts you are
imagining in a ship with decks perpendicular to thrust. You *will* in
one with them Parallel. Because then at some point during takeoff or
descent, especially on airless worlds, it\'s got to shift from "flying"
horizontally to standing on its tail. Because it *has* to be standing
on its tail to fight gravity effectively unless it\'s got *hideous
amounts of acceleration to spare.

There will be something similar, simply because you want your *own*

Which is *exactly* what will be happening during takeoff and landing.
After a bit you *will* tilt some, but it\'s not much of a tilt, and the
planet\'s gravitry is dropping with every meter you travel, while the
thrust from the ship remains constant. 

I\'m pretty sure that folks on the shuttle feel the direction of "down"
change by only a few degrees during take off. And it makes a much more
pronounced orientation change than a typical traveller ship will
because it has to go into orbit (which requires a lot of side vector)
while a trader is going to be making a run straight out the the jump
limit. 

For landing, you may need to flip the ship 180 at some point. But this
can either be done by cutting thrust and doing a slow spin (little side
force), or by doing a fast or slow "skew turn" with main thrust
maintained.

But as I point out above, the decks *will* be perpendicular to the
gravity field while you are in it. Unless you are going for a low
orbit, you don\'t *need* to change the ship\'s orientation until the
planet\'s gravity is pretty weak. 

Ships *don\'t* come in like airplanes. They go straight up, and straight
down, as that *minimizes* the amount of time they have to fight
gravity, and thus saves on fuel.

This can be a problem. On the other hand, there can be a shaft at one
side (or even in the middle) where the cargo elevator can lower all the
way to the ground. This is also useful for getting heavy parts to/from
the engineering spaces. :-)

Ok. You can have a fueling accident (on the ground) where the fueling
line came loose and some poor sucker got drenched with a few hundred
liters of LH2. Instant icicle.

"The docs might have been able to save something, \'cause he froze so
fast. But he was off balance. And before anybody could do anything he
fell over... and shattered. Sweeping up the peices before they thawed
was no fun at all. Had a couple of guys get sick and loose their
lunch." 

Steal an idea from the late G. Harry Stine. He wrote a book about
building a Solar Power Satellite, and had the MD on the project coin
the term "vac-bite" for the results ofbrief, partial exposure to vacuum
or near-vacuum. This is based on the *real* effects of folks losing
gloves from pressure suits at high altitude or in vacuum chambers.

The extremity swells as it fills with fluid (due to the pressure
difference making fluid tend to accumulate). Near surface capillaries
rupture, giving a distinctive "web" pattern of red on the skin. This
*doesn\'t* necessarily go away later. And you can get some effects
similar to bruising. 

Skin is *strong*. Unless it\'s damaged, it *won\'t* rupture. if there are
cuts or tears, they will bleed quite freely, but the blood *can* clot
well enough to close small wounds anyway (a Shuttle astronaut had a
metal bar that\'s part of the gloves shift and puncture both his hand
and the glove. He thought it had just pinched him until they foound
blood in the glove after the mission). 

Anyway, Vac-bite would be a useful item to add for minor accidents in
vac suits.

I do not know any pure metal nor an alloy that is transparent at more than
some micrometers thickness, but there are some salts, along with lots of
other compounds, which are.

If you reduce this to _metal-like_ compunds I as a chemist would have no
objection against it, such as compounds which have electric conduction
properties but are still transparent - or change their transparence by
currents.

But I have to say _I do not know_ any transparent metals - that does not
necessarily say that there _are none_ ...!

But these rollers arn\'t above the ground level. They lay underground, so
much of the buildings walls are supported by the ground around them. There
is also lots of pillars, stairs, internal walls and so on that extend from
the ground floor down into the basements. These and the ground keeps the
building form falling over in a hurricane or a earthquake. The rollers are
there to minimize the damage.

I did not consider them being either good or bad, also didn\'t to the 3I.
(The cold war is over, and even Bond worked together with some Russians.)
The fact is, I\'m playing in the 3I and for the players the Zho\'s are bad.
They do not yet really know them so it a little less than that.
Especially one of them, playing a Zhodani agent, must have the different
view. 

I\'ll try to let the above question be cleared by the players themselves.
I think they will agree to some points of the zhodani being good - at
least they have to, for not losing this special player character. But
that\'s interesting, everyone in the group tries to think out the best for
him.

As soon as they find out, (i.e. the players still do not know about their
spy), they\'ll get in contact with some Zho campaigns ...

I still have one problem - IMTU, the year is 1105 and the 5th FW still
waiting for 2 years ... I don\'t know if to prevent this or how ...

Unless of course it is streamlined or airframed and have contra gravs it

I agree that the AHL deck 01 dome seemed silly to me, but how much do 
you want
to bet that the deck plates dividing deck 01 and 02 is a load 
bearing/armored
deck equivalent to the hull of the ship, and that it\'s depressurised as

of sounding general quarters. The AHL is only partly streamlined (for 
gas
skimming) so the blunt gooseneck (assuming a blown dome) shouldn\'t be

a problem. I can see SOME justification for the IISS AHL\'s (a place to

Yes, perhaps comparing a 50-story building to a 70-meter streamlined
flying machine is a bit artificial.

Perhaps my 70-meter needle with it\'s three two-meter landing legs is
using less efficient space than your 70-meter needle sitting upright with
the much longer landing legs it would require. But you will _never_
make a needle sit upright as stable as a needle will lie down, not unless
your landing legs are posting out 30+meters in every direction.

And now you\'re sticking up 50 more meters or so than I am. 
The berm around my landing pad protected my ship when something
dangerous happened, your ship got knocked over.

As for getting around in airports vs getting around in skyscrapers:

Rich, you haven\'t been paying attention. When the Starship volume
approaches that of an airport or skyscraper, the ships are better built
like skyscrapers. Of course it takes less time to ride an elevator to the
top of a skyscraper than it takes to walk across an airport concourse.
It also takes less time to walk across the dining area of a McDonald\'s
than it does to wait for the elevator and ride it to the second floor.
Elevators are more efficient in some roles, they would be a silly waste
of time in a scout ship - especially considering the access ladder
you\'d have to put beside it for the eventuality of it becoming stuck.

Not to mention, ships the size of skyscrapers shouldn\'t be landing
anyway. The only reason to have an airplane configuration
(besides the aesthetics of the designer) is to make more of your ship
easily accessible to ground crew and cargo loading. Unless your
ships are flying saucers or other pseudo-streamlined designs, you
can\'t do this better than airplane configurations.

IMO, you should see airplane deck configurations on any ship
designed to land on a planet - ships designed to use class B or
lower starports, or subsidiary starports. Bigger starships must need
a reason for not using a skyscraper design. A few possibilities:

Spinal mount access: The entire ship is built with access and
maintenance of the spinal mount in mind. Long rooms parallell each
section of the spinal mount, and it was found to be less complex to
have one gravity field orientation (paralell to the spinal mount).

Cargo bay: a major cargo bay is part of the ship\'s design, taking up
a significant portion of the ship\'s length. Access during flight under
normal gravity conditions (such as care of live cargo) is a desired
capability, it is more convenient for the room to be longer instead of
taller.

Other ships may have been designed with airplane configs simply
because it fit the aesthetics of the designer. Inertia is nullified,
an artificial gravity orientation of your choice is imposed on the ship,
these will cost and drain power no matter how your ship is arranged...
why not make a ship so the passengers can go up to the dorsal
observation lounge and look back over the finely sculpted radiators
to stern?

Rich, you\'re accusing me of picking straw men to support my argument.
This isn\'t what\'s happening. I\'m taking a well-supported item from Canon
and trying to interpolate the postulated technology to make sense of
it. You, on the other hand, are sticking like a religious fanatic to
some other brand of physics (real world, maybe?), because you happen
to detest those physically impossible airplane-style deckplans.

It\'s science fiction. Inertia is damped, artificial gravity works. These
two items make most of the physics you\'re using much less relevant
to the art of starship design. If you don\'t like it, fine - IYTU.

Hmmmm...what about streamlined craft with airframe hulls?

Depending on the thrust tech you are using, you can fly to the edge
of space and then keep going - use the soup of atmosphere to some
advantage when you\'re deepest in the gravity well. 

How about this:

1. Contragrav nullifies gravity effects - your ship sits neutral on the pad.

2. Your maneuver thrusters kick you up a bit and maintain station - you
could theoretically use them to get to orbit, but it would take a long
time (what with all the air resistance, wind and such to overcome).

3. When far enough away from the busy downport, you start ticking up
the juice to main engines - a little at first, using vanes on your ship\'s
surface and some maneuver jets to keep course. Continue until you
are far enough from downport, or high enough altitude, that you\'re
allowed to go to full thrust. On a high-enough populated planet, you
might not be allowed to go full thrust until you were clear of COAC
jurisdiction.

4. Ride full thrust out of atmosphere and out of orbit.

The above assumes contragrav exists in your universe.

Yes!  *Many* years ago, just after the CT Zho supplement came out, I was
lucky
enough to play a pseudo-Zho PC in a campaign based on the border of the 
Consulate just outside the Spinward Marches. The best thing about the
campaign
was that psionics was just another tool and that the adventures were based
less
on player/NPC greed and more on an individual\'s _interpretation_ of what was

the "right thing to do". Since the information various PCs/NPCs had access
to 
differed, a number of different interpretations, some of which conflicted, 
invariably were reached and acted upon.

That and the fact that Tavr\'chedl staff were usually reserved for planets
with
a population above a certain level led to some truly thought-provoking 
adventures and quite a few discussions on ethics and the nature of
enlightened
politics.

After all this time, I *still* have the character and his journal.
Hmmm...think
I\'ll peruse the journal tonight for old time\'s sake.

That is one possibility.  Here\'s something that had come up in my game,
custom reproductions.
For example a reproduction of an ancient RoM Warbird Type-40 or such.
With all the original components reproduced, THAT should cost a pretty
credit!

Have you ever tried to keep a ship in "Mint Condition" w/o having it
mothballed in some hangar somewhere?  IMNSHO ships are far too valuable
(and expensive) to have them made as collectors\' items, I don\'t care how
much stash you got.

This is about the way cars and homes are done today.  An amortization
(sp?) schedule is used to find rate of depreciation, etc...  I would think
it would be the bank in which the ship was financed by would set the rate.

>4.  Ships depreciate based on a combination of age, condition, design,

This is by far the best possibility.  Combine the depreciation rates with
the condition of the components.  The relative value of the ship could be
computed during annual maintenance. 

>Your thoughts?

This brings into mind the possibilities of shady "used ship dealers"
throughout charted space.
You are looking to an alternative into the 40 years of debt and that
pricey down payment.  You locate a "buy here, pay here" dealer for used
starships.  You pay the man a reasonable amount of cash on an old TL-11
Free Trader, only to find out that the only thing on board the ship that
is TL-11 are the Thruster Plates!  Everything else is TL-9 or worse!  The
J-drive is a finicky peace of hardware prone to misjumps; there are power
cables in the wrong places, etc...  It looks like the thing was put
together with salvaged pieces from other ships.

Oh yeah, that brings up the subject of starship chop shops, which leads
into the capturing of ships, which leads into pira...

Let\'s not go there. ;-)

I\'m assuming you can vector or direct the thrust a little. You need to do
this to be able to maneuver any vehicle, not matter the deck orientation. I
admit this creates a residual lateral force, but you can place the bowling
ball at the centre of mass and eliminate the effect. This residual force
need be only a fraction of a G and can be ignored for most practical
purposes.

If you insist on this level of detail, there are all kinds of effects like
dynamic equilibrium and moments of inertia that Traveller does not even
begin to simulate. Which is fine with me, I don\'t care about the little
stuff, it\'s the Big Stuff that\'s wrong that sticks in my craw.

>Rich, I know you detest airplane deckplans, but you have to keep the

I have no complaint with comic-book physics, so long as it enhances the
enjoyment of the game. I use psionics and thruster plates, even though they
violate the laws of thermodynamics, because they are fun and support the
Traveller background. Using volume to calculate acceleration is incorrect,
but is close enough to real-world physics and simplifies the game.

Airplane-style spacecraft deck plans are comic-book physics which add
nothing to the game. They are utterly preposterous, nothing in canon
depends on them, it would be no more complicated to do it right, yet there
they are in diagram after diagram, deck plan after deck plan, in every
incarnation of Traveller.

And it would be easy to fix it; you could leave all starship designs
unchanged, just fix up the drawings and move the engines in the deck plans
a little. But nobody does this.

based on age and tech level (in TNE there are "maintenance points" and "wear values"

and maintenance and you\'re all set).

If you don\'t use maintenance points, then calculate a ship\'s blue-book

something like:

Bleah... I prefer something that can be manipulated with a task roll.

Richard, Richard... lighten up a bit. I\'m not going to try to convince
you that you are wrong; however, you need to accept that at least some of
us just don\'t agree with you. Reasoned arguments have been presented to
support airplane-style deck plans; likewise for the contrary. While this

Well, ideally speaking, you\'d want a small vessel to waste no \'perimeter\'
space on engines; put that in the belly, ground-down when on the surface.
This also gets you perpendicular decks, with all the safety and other
benefits that have been mentioned.  Put your one or two big decks in a
ring around the power/motor core.  It\'s trivial to open most of the ship
directly to the outside world, using (say) hull segments that hinge at the
bottom to become ramps.  Now, what does such an optimal hull look like...?

Seems our friends from Zeta Reticuli can teach us TMLers a thing or two
about small-starship design! :)

  These are the voyages of the starship Mae Lee;
  Its ten-year misson:
    To obtain liquid assets adequate to the operating needs of the
      corporation;
    To secure a return on investment comparable with the Velshun &
      Higgs Leading Merchant Indicators, consistent with preservation
      of capital;
    To boldly refinance 30-year secured loans where no sophont has
      refinanced loans before!

Yes; for the Lab Ship \'owners\', substitute spending 80% of your time on
paperwork and politics to obtain the research grants needed to fund
operations...

One possibility is that the Zhodani have - for whatever reason - some
prejudice against machine-aided psi, and machine-only psi like mechanical
psi shields; their reseearch in these areas might progress more slowly than
one would epxect due to a prejudice in favour of "pure" mind-only psi power.
(It\'s cliched and irrational, but could be offered upa s a way to have
Imperial PSI sresearch be at least vaguely competetive with Zhodani.)

I\'ve been looking at a chart in an old JTAS article "Troops in the Fifth
Frontier War" - I\'ve found it  helpful for determining numbers of
Battalion-equivalents per system/world. (I\'m looking at applying the Cardwell
reforms to the British Army (1881) to the Imperial Army - will pass it on to
the list when finished.)

Is there any equivalent for SDB numbers? I\'ve looked at Pocket Empires but I\'m
hoping that a similar look-up chart might be available.

take on a TL 11 200 Td Free Trader (a traveller staple). This design is intended 
as a simple no frills tramp serving frontier and backwater worlds. Thus it has to 
be built to load and unload every variety of cargo (not only standardised cargo 
modules) on a world surface with little or no assistance. It has a cargo capacity 
of 100 Td (half its volume) and uses a slab configeration (12m x 5m x 48m) 
giving a cargo area of 12m x 5m x 24m. If it used a perpendicular layout this 
would give a single 60m2 x 24m cargo bay. With a parallel layout you get a 
single 288m2 x 5m cargo bay. With a perpendicular layout you have to lift the 
cargo 24m (roughly 10 stories), with a parallel layout you only have to lift it 5m 
(roughly 2 stories). You can load the parallel deck with nothing more complex 
than a ramp, rollers and some local muscle (TL 0). I think _in_this_case_ the 
advantages of a parallel deck outweigh the advantages of a perpendicular deck.

Well, considering that most of the usable deck area of the S/C consists of
the main deck (which is 3m tall, including space used for ventilation,
plumbing, etc.), you could have a realistic maximum of about two staterooms
per deck.  The bridge and avionics now take up multiple decks, and the
common area, air/raft bay, and cargo bays would each require their own
decks.  The engine room will also consist of multiple decks of catwalks, in
order to service the now vertical engines.  Storing cargo will also require
multiple decks to properly access anything (the S/C\'s cargo access is
solely through iris valves and standard hatches).  Don\'t forget that we are
now talking about a wedge shaped airframe with a maximum footprint of
9x20m.  Sophisticated landing struts will be needed to keep this ship
upright during any severe wind conditions.

Of course, this all changes if we adopt a saucer or sphere shaped hull
instead, but I\'m not about to tamper with the traditional vessel
silhouettes of the Traveller universe :)

By adding a minimum of two* space-wasting elevator shafts/ladders?

* I use the number 2 as a minimum, since elevators and vertical ladders do
  not allow people to pass by one another.  You must wait for the elevator
  to be free or the ladder to be clear before you can use it, while passing
  in a 1.5m wide hallway is much easier.  If the AHL was laid out like the
  S/C, you could move 500 troops from one end to the other far more easily
  than you could with the AHL\'s 3 main-- and 4 tiny-- elevator shafts.

For what it\'s worth, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (Pub 946) sets the
depreciation "lifetime" for 

"Vessels, Barges, Tugs, and Similar Water Transportation Equipment, except
those used in marine construction"

at 18 years.  Clearly, this is accelerated depreciation for tax purposes,
as Eris discusses - which is why I couldn\'t use the data in estimating the
economically useful life of ships (my original interest).

Excuse me!?!  "Simply *rest* on the ground?"  Skyscrapers rest *in* the
ground, which is far more stable than a ship or rock resting *on* the
ground (even with "landing clamps").

Agreed.

It would be a worst case scenario, if constructed on the scale of an
average three bedroom home.  I repeatedly stated that the skyscraper
analogy works perfectly fine for large vessels.  It does not work well when
scaled down to the size of vessel that most PCs will be around.

It very well could.  The "ship" is resting on three or four pads, each
supporting a third or a fourth of the ship\'s total mass.  If one pad landed
on terrain that was softer than the rest, the ship is *already* unstable.

A skyscraper, OTOH, has it\'s foundation firmly "anchored" in a mass of
concrete and rebar dozens of metres *into* the ground.  More importantly,
the mass of the skyscraper is distributed over its entire foot print, not
three or four tiny (by comparison) landing pads.

Elevator shafts have one car per shaft.  This is wasteful, when compared to
a corridor where you could move hundreds of people in the amount of time it
would take for a motorized "box" to move a dozen individuals horizontally
in a tunnel.  Furthermore, stairways take up about 3-4 times the amount of
space that a hallway would take up, if orientated in the same plane.

Take a compacted cylinder of dirt and stand it on end.  Now push it gently
with your palm until it falls over.  Now push a similar column that is laid
out horizontally with the same amount of force (again, using your palm).
You\'ll note that the second example does not cause the cylinder to
experience nearly as much damage as the first.  IOW, a ship with
perpendicular decks will suffer far more damage than one with parallel
decks, if the forces are identical.

Exactly.  What some people are against is the "idea" of changing many of
the canon Traveller vessels so that they now have perpendicular decks.  If
you change the hull configuration even the smallest amount, you\'ve changed
the silhouettes that most of us have become fond of.

Come again?  A needle or wedge hull configuration-- with decks laid out
perpendicular to the axis of thrust-- with the main drive in the bottom of
the ship?  That I understand (eg: AHL), except that you would be constantly
fighting the ship in order to fly in even a straight line.  But landing it
*flat* on the ground?  Now you need artificial gravity to keep
everyone/everything from sliding towards one "side" of the ship.  Didn\'t
one of the points of this thread have to do with the subsequent loss of the
ship\'s gravity generators?  Or did it have to do with the wasted energy of
maintaining a gravity field perpendicular to the axis of flight?  I forget.

But the original idea of this thread (I think) was not to suddenly change
all of the canon starship layouts, but to come up with a good reason for
decks orientated in line with the thrust axis.

And you\'ve just explained one advantage of parallel decks: that of the
*lack* of a need for cranes or elevators to unload bulky cargo.  Wanna
unload a shipment of wheeled vehicles from your Fat Trader?  No problemo!

This only works if the entire ship revolves around the bowling ball.  IOW,
the bowling ball would have to be at the exact center of mass of the ship.
This is **HIGHLY** unlikely, so the bowling ball would indeed topple.

How do you move the engines "under the center of gravity" without changing
the axis of thrust of the vessel?  You would have to use two drive rooms in
a manner similar to the Gazelle CE, with the cargo bay in between.  And now
your cargo bay is taller than it is wide or deep, requiring subdividing
"floors" to properly stow everything.

The canon scout is a wedge configuration, which isn\'t really that far off
from the needle configuration.  The canon image of the Guardian SDB appears
to be a wedge or streamlined box, yet it is listed as a needle
configuration.  Which do we believe?

Saying that nothing in canon depends on parallel-oriented decks is in
itself, preposterous.  You would invalidate any and all canonical deckplans
and/or adventures that already exist.  That\'s a pretty big "nothing".

The whole "premise" behind the fat trader would be lost.  It has a drive
thru cargo bay for easy loading and an airframe for maneuvering in an
atmosphere.

Why *must* all Traveller vessels be designed with perpendicular decks
again?  I 100% agree that the concept works fine for larger ships, but it
just doesn\'t work well enough with smaller ships to be worth arguing about.

Because it isn\'t worth the effort.

that are parallel to the line of thrust, BUT that there are too many of

My sugestion is for those who believe in the perpendicular
decks-to-thrust line to design the following ships in this style: Free
Trader, Far Trader, and Subsidized Merchant.  And lets see if we can get
them added to the existing designs in a future publication.

The requirements:
  1) Line of thrust goes through the center of mass (close approx.) both
loaded and empty
  2) Best streamlining in the line of thrust
  3) footprint large enough for stability in wilderness landings (saturn
rockets and ttail landing of a standard scout are NOT stable for
wilderness landings)
  4) ease of cargo access for both standard cargo modules (for this use
5dT modules 3m w x 3m h x 7.5m l) and any cargo at TL0

In addition to these the Subsidized Liner, Close Escort, and SDB need to
be redesigned as these ships need not land on a planet. (the current
configuration of the SDB would be appropreate for lying-in-wait in a
gravity well)

I have taken these examples from the Traders and Gunboats LBB, later we
can work on other standard designs

The Regency is making advances with "almost no efforts."  Remember that psi
institute on Regina has been going for quite awhile.  They\'re just de-

Heck, steal an idea from one of James Wite\'s lesser known works. Pick a
habitable but undeveloped planet (say there weren\'t any mineral
deposits worth the trouble), and dump the prisoners there. If you are
*really* worried, land them using modified "personal re-entry kits".
Make supply drops of medecines and food supplements from time to time. 

No need for guards, and they can wander all they want (though they\'d be
smart to stay near the area where the supplies get dropped).

You do have some satellites in orbit to keep an eye on things. 

This opens up some lovely rescue scenarios.

Again, they do *not* keep the building from falling over. 

Try this. Draw a silhouette of a skyscraper. Mark the center of mass.
Now, see how far you have to tilt the building to get the center of
mass *beyond* the building\'s "footprint". 

You\'ll find that this requires moving the upper end of the building by
*huge* amounts. Far more than any wind is going to, and more than any
quake will either (unless there\'s an uplift fault under one side of the
building *and* it uplifts quites a bit)

Also, try calculating how far *up* the center of mass had to move while
the building was pivoting on the side to get the CoM outside the
footprint. Now try to figure out the approximate mass of the building
and how much energy it takes to lift that much mass that far. 

*That* is why buildings don\'t topple. The foundations are to keep them
from *sinking*.

You *can\'t* extrapolate from the behavior of objects of the size you
normally handle to that of objects 10 or 100 times bigger. The
square-cube law makes the situations too different. Scale *matters*. 

And a ship that\'s 40 meters tall is a lot closer to the building scale
that to the "human" scale our intuition works with.

Oh yeah, for the folks worried about landing legs on soft ground
causing a ship to topple? I suggest re-reading the description of
starport types. Why do you suppose that type E is described as
"essentially a marked spot of BEDROCK"? Maybe to avoid exactly that
problem?

    'body' => 'Fellow Travellers!

I will be attending DragonCon this year in Atlanta, which starts
Thursday of this week.
(Registration starts Wednesday night: TOMORROW).
I have a two bed hotelroom and at the last minute I do not have a
roommate.  If anyone
out there is planning on attending the con and would like to share the
room with me,
please either send me email, and/or leave a message for me at the hotel
desk in Atlanta. I
will check my email tonight and tomorrow morning prior to departure.   I
would prefer
to know if someone is interested so we can plan to meet.  My phone
number is 214-341-5714.  I do plan on registering Wed night for the
convention, so allow for that in planning to meet me.

Hell, if you are a fellow Traveller from this list, don\'t need a room
and just want to meet for
a beer or several, leave me a message!

The Details:
Where:The room is in the Hyatt Regency Hotel (the main party hotel) on
Peachtree Street..  Yes, the hotel that was sold out since April!  I
will be arriving Wednesday at approximately 4 pm to check into
the room.  This is approximate, allowing me two hours buffer from the
time my flight
is \'scheduled\' to arrive in Atlanta from Dallas.
When: I will have the room Wednight night to Sunday night, departing
Monday morning.
Cost: Currently the room is $119. night + taxes.  If we have to pay
extra to get extra
keys and towels, so be it.  I want to split everything evenly, except
for parking costs.
You are on your own with this, and so if this is the only extra that
needs to increase
the cost then if you need it, it would be much appreciated if you cover
that.  I would
prefer someone who will stay the whole time while I am there to split
the whole thing.
Roommates: I am male, and don\'t care the persuasion or whatever type of
sophont would
like to share.  However, smoke in the room irritates me, and I will
request a non-smoking room.  My only stipulation is that I have a bed to
myself and people let me sleep.  Usually the ONLY time I am ever in the
room is at night when I want to sleep.  If there are two or three or
more people who want in, then they can decide who shares the second bed
versus the floor.  I have requested a room on the lower floors, near the
party floors but not on them.

Folks, I have done this before at other cons, and it works out pretty
well.  Last year,
at San Antonio World Con I was the guy looking for space in the party
hotel.  Two years before, I had an extra room at GenCon which I shared
with someone on this list.  This
year, I am the guy with the room.   I am not worried if I don\'t hear
from someone on this
list;  usually you can find someone at the con.

Remember, leave a message for me at the hotel desk.  If you care to
meet, 4 or 5 pm at the
main desk would probably be best (earlier the better).
thanks,

I believe you\'re right. It also has GDW\'s first attempt at rules for
exploring
and surveying uncharted space. Not too bad, actually.

BTW, there was a post awhile back which stated that there could be no
non-psionic Intendants or Nobles onboard Zho warships. This is true;
by definition, Intendants/Nobles have *some* kind of psionic ability.
However...non-psionic proles *can* become officers by attending OCS 
and possibly gain a command. Even as officers, though, they cannot
receive psionic training.

One last thing. Zhodani psionicists *can* increase their Psi rating
during their career. Every Zho character (PC/NPC) I\'ve generated
ended up with a Psi rating of at least 11 with a minimum of 2 Psi
skills. One even made it to 15 with every Psi skill in the book.

Kinda scary...

My guess? IF he\'s alive, he\'s haulin\' a** for somewhere out of reach of INI.
Something blew his plot, most likely daddy\'s little girl. His brother the
Admiral, under ummm, questioning [1], ratted out everyone else, which is why
he was allowed to resign and go back to the family farm to recuperate, rather
than die of a sudden heart attack.

My bet\'s still on Dulinor being on the ship, though. A maybe dead, maybe not
leader of a glorious revolution is generally much more effective never coming
back, since in glorious martyrdom to the cause they don\'t have all of those
nasty human failings that show up later.

Also, if they thought for a moment that Dulinor was alive, Astrin would be
dead as the most powerful second in command.

[1] Why did I suddenly get a flash of the Admiral in the Box with Pembleton
and Bayliss?

Yes it would. Since CO2 is a byproduct of our own respiration the human body
has specific regulation and feedback systems based on CO2 levels. Too high or
too low and we can ahve problems. (Too high, you end up with acidosis, and
your breathing rate goes up dramatically as the body tries to rid itself of
the excess. Too little, and you can \'forget\' to breathe, as CO2 level is one
of the triggering mechanisms of the breathing reflex. Fortunately, the latter
is usally self correcting, since we\'re _making_ CO2 all the time, you just
tend to pass out.)
 
> 2)      can CO2 be filtered out by a simple filter mask?

Yes. They use CO2 absorption cartridges on submarines and space stations now. 

The big problem with a high CO2 level in the atmosphere, of course, is the
greenhouse effect. A planet with a naturally occuring high level of CO2 will
be very hot indeed.

Possible...but we\'re trading close to other problems, CO is flammable above
12.5% in a standard atmosphere. Of course toxicity limits are reached long
before that. Not having any toxicology books handy, I don\'t remember the
dangerous ranges, but it\'ll be much lower.

But, happily, looking up CO in my handy merck\'s index says that RT catalysis
of 
2CO ->  CO2 + C occurs over a catalyst of mixed maganese and copper oxides, or
palladium on silica, so it\'s easy to deal with. You make a dual stage
respirator, stage one removes the CO, and stage 2, the CO2, and the carbon
probably clogs up both stages with time. TL-6, maybe even TL-5 stuff.

CO is produced in oxygen starved combustion (which is why people die of it
from running fires in closed rooms) however, it still requires oxygen, which
means a biological source is unlikely as it\'s hard to find a niche with just
enough oxygen to support partial oxidation of carbohydrates or hydrocabons to
CO, and still have enough O2 to support human life, AND enough area to support
generation of enough CO to alter the atmosphere. 

Hmmm...on second thought...

You _could_ do it, if you had something that inhibited the solution of oxygen
in the oceans. However that means that there\'d be huge volumes of _anaerobic_
spce in the oceans, probably using either sulfur or methane metabolism. Our
hypothetical micro-organism then lives on the methane bubbling past it, in the
upper layers of the ocean turning methane into CO. Still you get a lot of
energy out of turning CH4 +2 O2 -> CO2 + 2 H2O. Also your\'e likely to have a
real mess of odd compounds in the oceans as a result of this metabolic cycle.
Making Sacnoth as strange place to live.

That and all the methane in the air...which, as a greenhouse gas, leads to the
ol\' global warming thing.

Volcanic sources are equally unlikely, since, not so oddly enough, such
sources easily support the temperature catalyzed decomposition of CO to carbon
and CO2. (all you need is 400-700 C. Above 800, the reaction favors CO
formation, but it\'ll pass over lots of (relatively) cooler surfaces on it\'s
way out to the atmosphere so it\'ll change back.)

That leaves industrial, which is extremely likely, since thats the souce of
most CO in urban areas here on earth anyway.

If Sacnoth is polluted enough to have CO levels that\'ll kill an unprotected
human in 7 days...the _rest_ of the so-called atmosphere will make Mexico
City\'s look like a fresh alpine meadow, and would likely kill you faster than
the CO would.

If you need a needle lying down then design one with perpendicular decks
lying down. But, frankly, a needle standing up can be made as stable as you
want. The landing legs don\'t have to be longer than any other design. If
your point is that you could make one with a lower centre of gravity, you
can make one with a lower centre of gravity than you prone needle too. Does
that make your design unacceptable?

How about the design I posted earlier of a ship with perpendicular thrust
and one deck? It was flat as a pancake; that one deck could even be lowered
right into the ground! Is this design acceptable?

If you believe this is a convincing arguement, how about this:

Design a ship with a *parallel* deck orientation sticking 50+ m above the
berm and one with a perpendicular orientation below the berm. Now this
mysterious whatever topples your ship instead.

Does this convince you that perpendicular orientations are therefore far
superior? No? Then why do you expect it to convince me?

Then don\'t put one in. You seem to be assuming that a perpendicular deck
orientation *requires* a ship to be tall and narrow. It does not; every
shape of every configuration possible to one deck orientation is possible
for the other. The problem with parallel deck orientation is in the
direction of applied thrust, not the shape.

IMO airplane deck configurations are good for airplanes, not spaceships.
The design constraints of the two are very different. Designing a spaceship
like an airplane is as sensible as designing one like an automobile.

Put the spinal mount parallel to the deck in a ship with decks
perpendicular to the thrust.

Make the cargo take up a significant portion of the ship\'s length,
accessable during flight under normal gravity conditions, longer than it is
taller, in a ship with decks perpendicular to the thrust.

Make a ship where .... whatever.... with decks perpendicular to the thrust.

Every configuration is possible in a ship with decks perpendicular to the
thrust.

Every shape is possible in a ship with decks perpendicular to the thrust.

The advantage with decks parallel to thrust is not their shape.

In the official Traveller universe there is a limit to the amount of
inertial compensation possible at each tech level, and more compensation
costs more money. A ship with decks parallel to thrust has to have enough
compensation to counteract the total thrust of the main drive, plus have
enough left over to provide internal gravity. Ships with decks
perpendicular to thrust don\'t.

This means that, according to the rules, ships with perpendicular decks
provide more compensation for less money. I think this is relevant to the
art of starship design.

With proper prep, the 5FW can be an excellent role-playing situation.  The
problem the first time around was that it was sort of sprung on us by
surprise.

IMTU, it\'s late 1106, and the characters are on the Njosnadeild\'s hot-list
for spoiling the Sword World\'s pirate offensive.  Right now, they are
caught up trying to figure out an unusual smuggling operation, and who\'s
been buying up all the lanthanum stockpiles in Lunion.  (Hint: Geimdeild
sambandshersins has a very large asteroid fitted with big engines...)

If at all possible, I\'m going to have the characters on Adabicci/Lunion
when the war breaks out.  Adabicci, you see, was a member of the
Sverdaheimssambandid until it was captured during the 3FW.  The locals
still are heavily pro-SW, and will take the arrival of the Confederation as
a sign to rise up and overthrow their Imperial masters...  I\'m really
looking forward to being able to reintroduce Sjolidsforingi Ivar Gordon,
who the characters have crossed before.  ("It can\'t be him!  He\'s dead!")

hehehehehehehe...

The Darby is designed to act as a prime mover for small independent
infantry units.  Built inside a 27m sphere, the Darby provide adequate
transportation and support for these irregular forces.

The Darby has Jump-2 and thrusters rated for 2G acceleration.  When fully
loaded, acceleration drops to 1.9G.  The hull is heavily armored against
most light weapons, but should not be exposed to naval gunfire.

Ship\'s armament consists of four 59Mj laser turrets grouped into two firing
batteries.  These weapons can be adjusted for effective ground support.
Also, four single missile turrets can be used in either the anti-ship or
ground support role.  

Darbys are well equipped with ECM, having a wide variety of jammers along
with a stealthed hull coating.  Sensors are a standard package.

Interface is handled by the two modular cutters berthed in docking rings.
Space limitations allows only a single spare module to be carried, and
module switch out must be carried out outside the ship.  Standard modules
include troop transport, fire support, fuel skimming, and cargo transport.
Troops may also be inserted from the 30-man drop capsule facility.

Unlike the older Broadsword, the Darby is fully streamlined, and can be
landed on any planetary body.  On-board CG drives provide 0.6G
acceleration, so care must be taken when operating around heavy-g worlds.

The Colonel Rogers class is another fine product of Gridlore Technologies..
Gridlore, *our* products aren\'t designed by drugged up children.

Design Notes:

This one was a quicky.  It\'s a basic home for thirty troops and their
keepers.  One nice thing was being able to armor it as heavily as I did,
and being able to add the drop room greatly expands the flexibility of the
craft.

If you pull the drop room out, you get an extra 16 tons, 10 of which added
to the cargo bay will allow an extra cutter module to be carried.

I\'ve always seen it as a ship\'s locker/stowage area for personal gear, not a
cargo bay per se.  (Original rules specified that each High Passage gets 1
ton of cargo space.)  Oh, and the \'small package\' trade...

Neither would use cargo modules, so it shouldn\'t be a problem.

I have used the \'attic\' area for some interesting encounters.  I\'ve had
everything from clothes lines to artwork and in the case of one particularly
twisted scout, a pistol range...

I always took it to mean that the size of the personnel hatch was the
max size for cargo packages. That 3 ton cargo bay is probably full
of survival suits, rations, man-portable equipment and such - it\'s
designed to support the needs of four to eight Scouts out in the
wilderness, not to carry formal cargo. The designer probably saw no
need to access the entire cargo bay at once, like with a cargo hatch.

Note the Seeker variant of the type S scout, it has cargo hatches
on the dorsal surface - the Seeker is designed to carry some cargo,
so needed the access.

  It\'s certainly possible (although you mention some valid drawbacks) but
it leaves the implication that either there are effectively no improvements
possible in psionics without external augmentation or that the Zhodani have
already discovered most if not all of those possible under that restriction.

  This assumes that the number of researchers (casual or institutional) and
the resources spent bear any relation to the results achieved - if not then
then the model used for psi-research needs some exploration.

I think the idea posted to the list was a good one. If you are certain
that all sub-1000 ton ships should be built with decks perpendicular
to thrust, and are sure that they can be designed with more
accessibility, efficiency and stability than ships with decks paralell
to thrust, then it behooves you to present some designs.

Really, I\'d like to see some - there are maxims you keep presenting
that don\'t make a lot of sense to me, and I think I\'d understand if
you drew a picture - even a sketch, if you didn\'t have time for
full deckplan design.

I\'ll accept that you can make a flying pyramid, call it streamlined
and stable on landing, and even have all the cargo in the base of
the pyramid. Is this what you had in mind?

That is why these talentless nobles need to be very wary.  Next time

If you use a deck plan (scanned from a book or whatever), you should
acknowledge the source of the plan, the copyright, and the trademark,
something like this:

of
the materials on this page are copyright 198X-1996 Far Future

The purpose is to protect the property (so no one can later come back

I would think that putting a deck plan in a web page comes under "Fair

Scout boats are built to go in, check things out, & come back.  The 3 to 4 
tons of \'cargo\' space they have would be used up in consumables like life 
support system recharges.  Especially since the Type S is notorious for having 
a really bad air recycler.  The rest of the stuff would be dedicated to 
mission-specific gear.  IMTU, I\'d let enough spares be stashed there to handle 
a field maintanance, which would last 4 to 10 months (1D6+3).

I noticed that.  Course, if the people who did the conversion rilly screwed

possible time.  <grin>

AHL has a history of several retrofits and upgrades.  It IS canon and I
certainly allow it IMTU.  My only requirement is that you don\'t take a
design from one system (Book 5 - High Gaurd) and upgrade it with features
from another system (FF&S2).

IIRC, lethal Anti-Hijack systems were mentioned in Traveller ships as far
back as "The Kinunir".  I think that was Adventure 1.  In that adventure, it
was not the lethal anti-hijack that was so unusual.  The limited-AI computer
that decided to kill everyone was the real attention getter.

Well, I thought "The Kinunir" was great fun.  I\'ve run it several times (on
different groups) and its always a crowd pleaser.

    'body' => 'I know this topic has been done and redone, but I\'d like to get some
opinions on the assumptions that make boarding parties possible IMTU.

1. Artificial Gravity. Artificial gravity is a field, approximately 3 meters
in height, projected from a grav plate while said grav plate has power.

Some grav plates have two settings, On (usually 1G) and Off. 
Transition from On to Off takes a second or so, transition from Off
to On can take tens of seconds, even a minute for older or worn
grav plates. Grav plates with only two settings are rather cheap,
but are uncommon. The practice of gradually matching ship gravity
to destination gravity over the one to two week voyage is too common
for such limited grav plates to be used on most starships, though
you may find them in use on orbital habitats that don\'t need to
vary gravity.

Most grav plates have a range of settings, to allow the aforementioned
gravity variation. These grav plates will have an Off setting and a range
of On settings, usually from .1G to 2G. It is possible to make
grav plates sensitive enough to produce less than one-tenth G, or
plates strong enough to provide more than 2G (though somewhere
around 5-8G seems to be a practical limit), but these specialized plates
will be rarer and more expensive.

The variable grav plates can transition from any On state to an Off
state in a second or less, though some very heavy (5G and up) plates
may take several seconds of progressively lower gravity drop to reach
an Off state. Transitioning between an Off state to an On state will
usually take a few tens of seconds per G or fraction thereof.
Changing from one On state to another will also take a few tens of
seconds per G of change.

Note that grav plates, in and of themselves, provide no protection from
acceleration due to outside forces - the gravity of a planet, or the
thrust of the vessel. These are taken care of by (respectively)
Contragrav and the related Intertial Compensators.

2. Contragrav

Contragrav is that miracle device that nullifies gravity. It is contragrav
that allows starships to float out of the sky like gliding birds,
skim gas giants, even (in smaller units) allows Air/Rafts to fly.
The field is relatively power-constant, not taking much more power to
nullify a 1G field than a 10G field. It can be moderated in several ways
as well - for example, a ship could allow some of a planet\'s gravity
to affect it, allowing the ship to orbit. 

Another way the contragrav field can be moderated is to introduce
a bias in the field, to provide propulsion. That, IMTU, is how an
Air/Raft works. As contragrav fields get larger, though, the amount
of propulsion available from field bias drops. A grav speeder can
fly hypersonically; a starship can barely move itself
with contragrav - in moderate winds, even simple station-keeping
will be difficult. Contragrav can make a starship float, but actual
movement will be done with maneuver thrusters, or the main drive.

Furthermore, the propulsion available through field bias drops
away drastically when you get away from a gravity well.
A speeder that flies hypersonic at sea level will barely move
in orbit - there\'s less gravity for the bias to push against.

3. Inertial Compensators

Inertial compensators: Based on technology similar to Contragrav,
the inertial compensator acts to eliminate the effects of acceleration
within the field. While contragrav interacts with a gravity field, 
inertial compensators create a field of their own within which
(as long as the field holds) the effects of thrust, maneuver and
even impacts are eliminated. Not countered with an opposing
force (at least not in a readily observable way) - eliminated.

Inertial compensators, once available, quickly become a
standard part of hull construction for all starships and
spaceships. In most civilian designs, they are always on
whenever the ship is in flight - it may take a major
engineering effort to shut the compensators down.
Some military designs are built with adjustable inertial compensators,
but this is the exception (for extremely power-tight ship designs),
rather than the rule.

For the most part, if the drives are functioning you will have
inertial compensators. No matter how the starship spins,
thrusts, or brakes, you would be unable to tell from inside
the ship that it was doing anything other than sitting still,
unless you looked out a window.

If you can turn inertial compensators off, they transition from
an On state to an Off state much like grav plates do, and
power up again in much the same fashion.

4. Life Support

Air. Pressure. Light. Heat. Sound.

Proper amounts of any of these are good, too much of any of
them can kill you, too little of most of them can kill you as well.

Air: Atmosphere mix is usually kept by a self-regulating system.
Sealed areas (those bounded by pressure-tight bulkheads)
could possibly have their mix affected, say with gas from a
security system or tinkering/sabotage with the air mix.
Not all ships have security gas, and such tinkering is dangerous
and can be complicated, if you want to affect only part
of the ship.

Intruders usually wear vac suits anyway.

Pressure: Ships are designed to be depressurized. Some areas
may be depressurized while other areas (across bulkheads) may
be left in pressure. Depressurization time is usually measured in
minutes or more, depending on the volume of the area. It may
be vented faster, if there are airlock doors that can be overridden
or cargo bay doors that can be blown. Such emergency
depressurization may make it hard to repressurize again.

Again, most intruders wear vac suits.

Light, heat and sound are usually easy to maintain, and easy
for a boarding party to protect themselves from. Nothing in
most ship\'s lockers will match the glare from a sun in space,
for example.

5. Effects these have on Boarding Parties:

No grav-pong. At best, you can make them float, or give them a
gentle roller-coaster ride (though sudden zero-G when a bunch of
people are charging down a corridor could be fun!).

Corridors can\'t be instantly turned into bottomless pits by turning
off the floor plates and turning on the 6G plate at the end of the
corridor. While you could put such a plate at corridor\'s end, it
would only effect 3 meters out or so - and would take a minute
or two to get up to strength.

You can\'t smash someone into a wall by applying 6G\'s of inertial
compensation while the ship isn\'t moving. In most ships,
you can\'t smash someone into a wall by turning off inertial
comp and gunning the engines - not if you want to be able
to turn inertial comp on again. Even in a military ship that
_can_ switch off the comp, you\'ll need to prep your crew
first...but if you\'re being boarded, your main drives are probably 
down anyway.

There are some bits of this that aren\'t exactly Canon, but I
like the feel they give to space combat. Minor damage on a
small ship can temporarily disable the drives, allowing a
determined crew of boarders to get across and do properly
cinematic things. <g>

Great!  I love it!  It\'ll make big fat happy targets for planetary defense
forces or ethically challenged civilians.  Lets see... High-Gaurd had
modifiers based on configuration but how do later versions handle this?  At
any rate; a large mostly-flat surface will not be stealthable so a detection
roll should be Easy/Simple or just plain Automatic.

Another problem with the flying pancake / horizontal landing is weather.
One thruster cell in the area and you are history.

Well, it may not be *the* advantage, but it is an advantage.  Follow this
for a moment:
Small cross section to oncoming sensors.
Small target to oncoming gunnery.
Ability to use stealth technology in the design.
Able to fire main gun at target while closing.
Refuelling with fuel scoops require hypersonic streamlining.

Inertial Compensation increases 1g for each TL increase.  If it is that
important, you could always make up the difference with G-Tanks and preserve
your ability to fight and GG-refuel.

Cost is a function of volume.  IIRC, the volume of internal compensators
increase only with the volume of the protected craft.  Whether that craft is
protected from accelerations of 1g or 6g is not a consideration for volume.
Compensated g\'s are a function of the TL of the unit.

>I think this is relevant to the art of starship design.

Only if you are designing a ~1g craft  AND  only if it is under acceleration
all of the time  AND  only if you do not install any inertial compensation
at all.

Might not be a bad idea for early TL spacecraft.  They have to use spinning
hulls or constant accel for gravity anyway.  Of course, they are not very

Whew. For every example I give of a ship that works better with
decks paralell to thrust, you say "just make it the same way,
with decks perpendicular to thrust".

I really need to see some sketches here. You want to take a needle
hull, put the engines in the middle instead of the tip? You want to
place a spinal mount perpendicular to thrust, instead of paralell?
You want to make a one-deck ship, "flat as a pancake", and call
it streamlined?

I\'m sure any of the above could be done. They\'re sure to be interesting
designs when someone does them.

It probably makes more sense to say that artificial gravity is a field
_between_ two plates.

There is no real distinction between these forces -- grav plates which create
artificial gravity are capable of compensating for perceived forces on the
occupants due to gravity or acceleration, provided they are aligned correctly. 
However, the speed at which these grav fields change alignment makes them of
marginal use for ships attempting to evade or otherwise change direction of
thrust quickly.

It actually seems more consistent with artificial gravity; fundamentally, it
seems to be artificial gravity which is (a) capable of changing alignment
extremely quickly, and (b) only useful for transferring velocity changes from
the hull to the occupants.  This isn\'t necessarily an unreasonable option. 
Note that most likely it would actually negate the effects of gravity as well
as acceleration within the hull.

Here, here!!

IMNSFBHO, the 1 hardpoint per 100 tons rule makes *sense*.  After all, the 
ship\'s hull has to survive some very severe stresses, like re-entries, 
scooping gas giants, violent manuvering (IMTU, gravity compensators do *NOT*, 
repeat, *NOT* affect the hull, they\'re *bounded* by the hull).  The hull is 
subject to every force that intersects it.  A good portion of the hull *must* 
be used for structural integrity.  Otherwise, a ship would *crumple* at the 
first solid hit it took.  Again, IMNSFBHO, the sight of a ship\'s hull bristled 
with stuff (sensor arrays, weapons, clip-on pods and such) is ridiculous.

Likewise, I think the 1 bay weapon per 1000 tons ship makes sense.  FASA\'s 
Adventure Class Ships Vol 1 had a 500 ton ship that violated the rules in that 
it had a missile bay *AND* 5 hardpoints.  The bay weapon would require 
additional bracing, and addition of 10 more hardpoints would weaken the hull 
IMTU.  I allow(ed) 2 ton missile pods to be rolled out of a 200 ton Q-ship, 
but they only carried 3 packed racks, some commo gear to allow them to be 
triggered, and enough computer & sensor power to allow it to lock onto 
something.  They could only be linked in salvos up to 30 missiles, and 
required 1 ton of control space & a gunner for each salvo.  The players could 
roll out 1 pod per combat turn.  Linking a number of pods took 1 turn.  Firing 
them took 1 turn.  They could be retrieved after the battle at 1D6+6 turns per 
pod, reloaded in 2 turns per pod.  They took the stock missiles from Book 2.  
And they took up space, too: 3 tons per pod & 12 tons for the launcher & 
retrieval module.

Those cargo bays were designed for food and consumables storage for long
duration missions and equipment bays for the extended sensor suite
installed on some active duty scouts.  Thus the cargo was to be hand
loaded

not on airport runrays, starport "tarmacks", or bedrock.  what you do to
the ground on wilderness landings is your business.

I had proposed this to get examples of the other side, so we can do
"scientific" and economic comparisons. I believe in some instances the
decks perpendicular to thrust will help in economic evaluations.

I don\'t really think that is really necessary.  There seems to be two view
points here regarding parallel vs. perpendicular deckplans:

There are some of us (myself included) that think that it is perfectly
reasonable for smaller ships to utilize a parallel deck layout.  Accepting
the existence of these ship designs does not invalidate canon.  Nothing
changes, or needs to be changed, except for the fact that the *idea* be
accepted as "possible" or even "desirable" for certain ship missions (eg:
small traders and such).  A question was asked a while back to help provide
a reason for their existence, especially when compared to some of the
advantages of perpendicular layouts.  I think that this question has been
satisfactorily answered in many ways.

Then there are those of us (primarily Richard Hough in regards to this
thread) that refuse to accept their existence.  IHTU, Richard has more than
likely scrapped all deckplans that utilize the parallel deck layout.  This
would mean that many canonical ships cannot exist in Richard\'s campaign,
which is perfectly fine for him and others sharing his view.  Also, the
silhouettes of all the parallel decked ships that we have all come to grow
and love since the days of CT most likely do not exist in his campaign.  I
make this loose-- and admittedly unfounded-- assumption due to the fact
that, using Richard\'s own logic, it would make far more sense to redesign
most of these ships from scratch as low, squat vessels, instead of simply
standing them on end and moving their innards all about.

Neither POV is "wrong" on the TML, but I must point out that the latter
requires significantly more work to incorporate into a canonical Traveller
campaign.  This is one advantage that the "pro-parallelers" can claim: the
ships in their TU require f-a-r less work to "accept" as canon, compared to
the latter (the cry "Why bother, when things are fine as they are?" comes
to mind).

Following is my view on why the existence of the 400 DT subsidized merchant
(ie: Fat Trader) can and should exist in any Traveller campaign:

1) cargo doesn\'t load much easier than on this ship
2) the ship has an airframe (ie: wings), just like the shuttle (another
   famous parallel vessel design), allowing it to maneuver easier in an
   atmosphere
3) the vessel can still land with inoperable drives
4) the vessel is very stable while on the ground
5) leaving it "as is" does not invalidate canon IMTU

Now Richard (or another pro-perpendicular individual) can come up with an
entirely different ship layout that would hold true for all of the above
(except the last one), but it would *not* invalidate the existence of the
canonical Fat Trader.

The only way that you could design an upright needle configuration to have
a lower center of gravity than one of a horizontal configuration, is if the
architect designing the former got an "A+" in engineering *AND* the other
architect got an "F"!

Not very aerodynamic, not even in old comedies.  How would such a ship

This is illegal, according to FF&S.  A spinal mount can only be mounted in
line with the axis of thrust (ie: spine).

On a geochemical level, would say its not clear.  There is
no hard and fast process that makes this impossible. However,
oxygen is produced from carbon dioxide.  If you have plants
doing this, one might guess they would keep pulling down the
CO2 levels, rather than leaving them at some high level.
However, we only have one example of the process (the Earth)
so it is hard to say.

Acording to the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for CO2
the PEL (permissible exposure limit, how much OSHA (the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the US)
lets you be exposed to for 8 hours) is 5000 ppm.

>2)	can CO2 be filtered out by a simple filter mask?

Yes.

I don\'t remember how much industry Sacnoth has.  But people who
pointed out that CO reacts with O2 are right.  The process,
however, is slow.  The main result is that you could have
CO in an O2 atmosphere if there was some continous source
of it.  The only natural process I know of is out gassing
from volcanoes.  To get decent amounts the planetary
mantle would need to be more reducing than the Earth\'s  is
now (we see volcanoes outgas CO2 and N2 today).  From its
material safety data sheet, it\'s PEL is 50 ppm (OSHA).
The TLV is 25 ppm.

Anoxic oceans were thought to have occured on the Earth.  The
early ocean was rich in disolved ferrous iron (Fe+2) from
hydrothermal systems.  As Oxygen levels started to rise,
it took some time to oxidize the oceans.  However, with
that big a sink for oxygen, I don\'t know how hard it would
be to get atmospheric oxygen up to breathable levels.

Similarly, today some bodies of water can be anoxic at
depth if the rate that organic matter (which consumes
oxygen as it rots) is being introduced exceeds the rate
of oxygen introduction.

I don\'t know enough biochemistry to know if bacteria would
be likely to make CO under these conditions.  My guess is
rather than make CO, they would go ahead and make CO2 anyway.

But the big question, regarding water landings, is would they float or
sink.  The weight of the ships seems to be more than the water they would
displace.

In theory, yes. In character generation reality, not really. Any

skill roll, making it virtually impossible for any character to *not*
have a Psionic skill if they really want one. And, let\'s face it, if

Ah, but the genetic codes for psionics are there...  You have got to
remember that the Zho want all of their nobles to be psionic...  So an
intendant to have a high psi-strength means that the children of that
person may have a better chance for psionic powers...

Water weighs 1000kg (1 ton) per kL.  Seawater is a bit more boyant. A scount
weighs 684 tons loaded and displaces 1400 kL.  Thus half its volume would be
beneath the water.  Since it is back heavy, that end would sink lower.
Without more information as to the center of gravity on a Scout, I couldn\'t
say more.  But the Megatraveller Referee\'s Companion has a picture of an
immersed scout.

that\'s the rub...you can\'t make CO in an anoxic environment, only a
micro-aerobic one (one with considerably reduced O2 content, anoxic has
none) The problem is finding an environment big enough to do that _and_
keep it that wayin the face of an atmosphere that has enough O2 for
humans...

You assume that pressure changes go only one way when, as you note,
too much is just as bad.  In the TML PbeM run by Mark Cook and Mike
Metlay, one of the more ingenious and twisted players came up with
a good way to subject intruders to a truly massive amount of over-
pressure.

Our ship\'s a big one, see, and we had this pool on board... the
player did a much better job of explaining the principle at work,
but it\'s basically the same as with one of those toy rockets you 
fill with some water (reaction mass) and compressed air.  So when
we vented a large compartment full of water (several tons) and air 
at 15 psi into near vacuum...

Well, it didn\'t matter that they were wearing suits.

	To be technical, it\'s not filtered but absorbed, by lithium

Thanks for the link.

This one caught my eye in the Army Field manuals:

A must for every starship medic.

How do the manuals look?  Any graphics or just raw text?

A _free_ source of at least some current US Army manuals, training aids,
and other truly useful stuff can be found at the following Web site:

http://155.217.58.58/

(This is the Army Doctrine and Training Digital Library [ADTDL].)

Anybody can download items not marked with a padlock, graphics and all. 
Active and Reserve Component personnel can register to download
restricted ("padlocked") material.  Looking at the list, there\'s plenty
of unrestricted stuff for the taking.  It\'s mostly in Adobe Acrobat
(.pdf) format, but I imagine that most folks on the TML can find an
Acrobat reader (I\'m pretty sure that one is offered at the Army site,
but not 100% sure.)

I don\'t know whether personnel from other branches of the US military
can gain the same privileges of unrestricted download.  *shrug*

If there are similar sites for other services (US and abroad), I\'d like
to see them posted here (after all, while the manuals were not _written_
with the Traveller multiverse in mind, I think that referees and players
could find useful material in current doctrinal manuals).

I\'m really, really sorry, Eris!  It was a really good article,
but -- when it came to the campagin-specific info -- I
didn\'t think that anyone in your group would be here, except
you.  I\'m really sorry - please forgive my clumsiness, and my

I also apologize to his players on the list: I don\'t like
ruining other folk\'s Traveller adventures AT ALL: or
spoling surprises...

* * * * * * * * * *

Tidbit\'s from today\'s Globe and Mail:

The current cruise boom suggest\'s several interesting
things that can be transmuted to Traveller.

"The Cruise Bowl would be a 12,000-passenger floating casino and sports
complex five times the size of a football stadium and too large ever to go
in to any dock."


See http://www.globeandmail.com/docs/news/19980901/ColumnOne/ucolun.html
for details...

Now, I can see the use of big, jump-capable spacestations as very useful in
a
wealthy Imperium (an average tech level of 14-15, rather than the current
"middle-class" Imperium of TL 12 or a way poor Imperium of average TL of
8 or 9).  In the Offical Imperium, there might be room for maybe 5 - 10 of
these
monster\'s, carrying 100,000 passenger\'s complete with shopping centre\'s,
live animal\'s and weather pattern\'s.  Of course, they will only be found
on the Vland-Capital-Terra route...

Rip out the jump engines, and these things become a LOT more common.
All those high-pop asteroid belt\'s...they\'ll love these ships.  Especially
if
there are two or more high-population worlds in one system.

********************

Not on their website, the G&M had a story on a enormous research ballon,
I believe 350 x 250 meters, open at the top, that some scientist\'s were
playing with.  It slipped out of their control in Alberta, Canada, and
headed east.
A Canadian CF-18 squadron  at Quebec pumped ~1,000 rounds of ammo
into the ballon but it just kept right on floating by.  It was tracked by
American
and British vessel\'s across the Atlantic, and is now at some Norwegan
islands.

The skin of the ballon is very thin, if I remember the article correctly.

Quite interesting: it would make for a nice sensor array, at least until the
natives figure out a way to shoot it down.  Use it in a Napoleonic-style
campagin:
ir should be much cheaper than an air/raft...

*********************

Imperiallines is a minor - but Imperium-wide - freight line, which is
owned by the Imperial Family. It operates mainly as a typical transport line,
but also has some jump-6 transport\'s designed to look like the standard
jump-4 ship.

One thing the Referee might do it make it the semi-offical transport line for
Imperial Research Station\'s.  The vast majority of good\'s shipped
are mundane, if of admittedly high quality.  Certain items, however, are
interesting: not important enough to rate Naval ship\'s, but too sensitive
to be hauled by regular civilian\'s.  Interesting relic\'s, bizzare scientific
experiment\'s, obscure animal\'s with unexpected abilities, and puzzling
enigma\'s would be carefully cataloged, placed in the hold\'s, and monitored.
Ninety-five percent of the time, nothing irrevocable or truly disasterous
happen\'s.

Just before the Terran\'s were contacted by the First Imperium,
they were divided by the standard American-East Asian-European
political groups, with the United Nations as a major force in it\'s own
right.

This need not, of course, be the case.  An alternative Earth at the time of
contact
will have serious reprocussion\'s.  Should your traveller\'s do a temporal
misjump, they could end up on a different timeline of a differently
flavoured
Imperium.  An Imperium unified under the banner of Islam is a very different
place, indeed.   Had the First Imperium met a unified, vigourous,
rationalistic,
racist Euro-American Empire, the end result would be very different than
meeting a world dominated by the stagnated, socialistic, half-Arab European
Union,  a vibrant Latin/Anglo hybrid culture dominating the America\'s,
and a fragmented, divisive Asian Block rapidly increasing (again!) in
wealth,
military might, and arrogance.

_______________________________________________________

The SSgt Arden Stillwell class Assault Troopship is designed to transport 
and deliver 2 Platoons of Heavy Mechanized Infantry in a variety of 
battlefield environments.

With it\'s port and starboard capsule launchers, this class of starship can 
drop it\'s battlesuited complement of Heavy Infantry, while simultaneously 
delivering the attached AFV\'s via the two Modular Cutters.  All while 
acting as an orbital weapons platform, courtesy of it\'s two dual 60 Mj 
laser turrets and four missile launchers.

If a resupply mission is called for, the SSgt Arden Stillwell class is 
armored to withstand moderate amounts of ground fire, and it\'s four large 
cargo doors will allow quick access to it\'s spacious 100 std cargo area.

Finally, the SSgt Arden Stillwell provides it\'s troopers with the latest in 
Low Berth technology.  While the unit Cadre (1 officer, 4 NCOs) are 
planning out the assault to come, the common trooper will slumber in the 
latest InGen LowBerth.  The advantage to the unit is that the soldiers will 
not suffer from the shipboard malaise and hostilities that close confines 
inevitably bring out in combat soldiers.  The advantage to the soldier is 
that even thought he/she is in suspended animation, the enlistment clock is 
still ticking!

Wealth implies responsibilities. One of the things Gurps does well (being a
third generation RPG) is it handles social relationships. I\'ll get to this
later.

If you want to be irresponsible, you can be ... but if you want to be a
respected member of the nobility, then you have to act the part. And
occasionally, that could include doing things that are stupid, dangerous or
stupidly dangerous.

I\'d split these into \'Income Stream, MCr 30\' and \'Debt Stream MCr 4\'. Note
that in GURPs terms, if the corporation fails it\'s \'job roll\' for the
MCr30, you still have to keep the bondholders coupons clipped.

How much work does it need to keep the MCr 50 in capital earning 10% ? How
stable is the government whose paper you hold ? Do the companies whose
stock you own expect you to sit on the Board (it Gurps terms, a couple of 2
point Duties)?

Personally, I\'d also say the rate of return is too high. Imperial interest
rates seem to be about 2-3%, which means a rate of 4% is doing pretty well.

But not always when you want it.

Heck, combine the two issues ("Well young Alva, I heard this story that
there might be some ahhh security issues related to labour problems on
Teiko. Take a couple of the disreputable rogues you call friends and take a
look see. You look pale. You should spend some more time in the sun ...
while you\'re there, you might get some hunting in ...").

Sort of. It depends what you do with it, really.

things
>like a mercenary platoon

Nope. Assume 50 troops, each paid KCr 20 a year. Thats a cold megacredit.
Then KCr 100 equipment each (and thats Combat Armour) is another MCr 5,
which probably takes KCr 250 a year to maintain. Then transport costs, at
(say) KCr 4 per jump in bunks.

In GURPs terms, this is Status, which costs XP and cash each month to

That\'s the point with Star Tech ... it works somewhat good in physics but
gets up to being ridiculous when talking about chemistry. It\'s the fact
that chamistry ends at the atomic/molecular level (sometimes at the
electronic, but no further). I read the ST Technical manual and had it
hard to hold laughing when I read of \'Sarium Krellide\' and the formula of
Dilithium ...

The metal properties of conduction and glittering colour both are based
on the electrons, which in metal are very \'loose\', i.e. got a high
moveability. (This in fact is described as an \'electron gas\')
The transparent materials we know (diamond (carbon), glass (silicates))
are the exact opposite, as they got hard, covalent bondings, which let the
electrons not allow to leave their atoms. So if you now alter the
structure of a metal to loose the shimmering, you also loose the
conduction - a probably the hardness, too. So we still can think only of
metal-like composites, that provide either the one or the other property
of metals.

But chemistry often can get a problem to SF. It works good when
considering the new biochemistry of an alien, but another point I don\'t
really understand as a chemist is for example the superdense armor.
As the metal crystal shows the way to pack atoms at the highest density, I
cannot think of a way to get them even closer without shoving the
electrons into the atom nuclei (and this being stable!). This only can be
explainable by altering the physics of the whole case. (some field? rays?
etc.) 

So there\'s only one way to explain it: It\'s SF. If we knew how to explain
it, we probably could build it and at the end would  - so where would the
fiction be? Good Science Fiction does not explain the future, but builds
it without interfering with present physics (and chemistry?)

Could I get scientific enough for the readers?

I agree that this would count as a filter mask for purposes of the
definintion of a tainted atmosphere. Can you tell me how long "every
so often" is likely to be? I mean, theres a limit to how big a lump
of this lithium hydroxide stuff you can comfortably lug around on a
face mask. I realize that this would depend on the exact CO2 content,
but could you come up with some ballpark figures (and perhaps even an
estimate of the cost of replacement "loads")?

Would these lithium hydroxide slugs be reusable? That is, how big and
complicated an apparatus would you need to remove the CO2 from them?

Rob Prior for the MacOS, Imperial Grand Survey v2 and QSDS.

Rob has spent the summer beavering away on some new software for you all
(well, for all the TML Mac owners!), which is now available. The demo
versions are downloadable from my website (see sig file for URL). Those of
you at GenCon UK may well get a chance to try them out.

*Imperial Grand Survey v2

... a superb (IMO) piece of software which implements sector generation at
a Domain level, allowing the Traveller Referee to rapidly create a
playground for their players to explore, fight over, and trade in. Supports
generation of multiple Milieux and Races, plus Collapsing Rules from TNE.
Maps may be annotated with text and calibration points. The software
implements the system generation rules from all previous versions of
Traveller, including the modified routes from the Alien Modules. Includes
language generation for world names.
Download of the "IGS2" Demo (103 kB compressed).

*QSDS

...an implementation of version 1.5 of the QSDS starship design system from
Marc Miller\'s Traveller. This software operates in the same way as
Infini-V, allowing a referee to design a ship up to 5000 dT through the use
of pull down menus, and allows final export of the design as Text or HTML
in the USD ship card format from the main rule book. (QSDS was written by
Guy Garnett, and may be found in the Missouri Archive. as an Acrobat file).
It is not planned to update this software to incorporate the \'Big Hulls\'
document at present, but if demand is high enough Rob will consider it.
Download of the "QSDS" Demo (94 kB compressed).
Still available----

*Infini-V
...an extensive implementation of the vehicle design rules presented in the
Imperium Games\' Central Supply Catalog. As well as performing all the
difficult calculations, the software provides the ability to export the
resulting design as HTML or text for use in other packages. Allows weapon
designs to be added and edited. The software is only available for the
Macintosh at present, but is currently being ported to the PC. Previously
available as the freeware alpha release \'CSC\', this software should load
CSC v1.3n files.
Download  of the "Infini-V" Demo (162 kB compressed).

(The above software is shareware, published through BITS. All programs are
fully functional except that the save, export and print options have been
disabled. Registration removes these limits, and also entitles you any
maintenance updates free of charge. Details about registering (costs and
addresses) may be found in the programs themselves.)

If you come across any problems with the software, please post to Rob or
myself directly...

inevitably bring out in combat soldiers.  The advantage to the soldier is 
that even thought he/she is in suspended animation, the enlistment clock is 
still ticking!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'ve seen an idea like this several times in sci-fi - crack troops kept
in suspended animation, only waking them up just before you send
them into combat.

Imagine the effect on the mind of the infantryman. Instead of the usual
combat tour, 90% boredom and 10% sheer terror, they get to experience
tours that are 90% sheer terror!

Assuming that the human mind can adapt to such conditions
(and the human mind is nothing if not adaptable), I\'d imagine these
"sleepers" would be, at the end of their tours, some of the most
dangerous people in the galaxy, even to walk by on the street.

While regular soldiers spent the past four years getting R&R,
shooting the bull, redoing training excercises, and dealing with the
post-action stress of their few intense combat experiences, the "sleepers"
spent the past two subjective months in near-continuous close combat.

In The Traveller Adventure game I wrote (http://www.nova.org/~sol/core) it
kept track of, essentially, the wear value of your ship. Normal use would
clock up the wear value. If you did something like run unrefined fuel
through it, it would clock it up more. Performing your "annual maintenence"
would mitigate a certain amount of wear. Doing this once a year would
generally keep the "value" of your ship roughly in line with the amount of
money outstanding in a normal mortgage. Doing it more often than once a
year would keep away more and leave you with a ship that was "younger" than
it appeared.
In the game these number were to lead on to two things:
1) If you wanted to re-mortgage your ship, the insurance company would
assess the wear on it and would give you a mortgage based on the value.
2) You would be able to buy other, bigger ships, who list price was well
beyond affordability, but because of its condition, was brought down to
something you could afford.

In actual roleplaying, it isn\'t something that I\'ve ever worried about.
Since the value changes slowly over time, I have seldom seen a campaign
where it ever mattered.

The topic "FM3_11.........FLAME, RIOT CONTROL & HERB OPERATIONS"
looks rather interesting. Somehow I don\'t think they\'re talking
about ginseng and cinnamon.

BTW, another good link is http://www.specialoperations.com/

It contains information, manuals, etc. pertaining to U.S. Special Ops.
All are downloadable. Of course, the nice thing about a CD is the info
is still available when a hard drive crashes, an ISP is down, or you\'re
using someone else\'s CD drive.

this question.

A player wants to insure his Mcr 750 starship against loss and damage.
This is precisely analogous to what I have on my car and home.  I need to
provide a biweekly (or monthly) payment to incorporate into ship\'s expenses.

My Homeowners policy will cover my home\'s loss and everything in it up to
an insured value of $180,000 (which is the mortgage principal, not the
purchase price, but let\'s not get into that), with a $500 per incident
deductable.  This will cover me if there is a fire, a rampaging bull or
tractor trailer truck comes through, large nasty people bent on
maliciousness (unless its "civil unrest") stealing my stuff, and various
other unfortunate happenstances.  It also covers me if my neightbor slips
on my stairs and sues me for all I\'m worth.

It will not cover me if I turn my home into a gymnasium and the musclebound
creeps wreck the place, that\'s a "business activity" and isn\'t covered.

It will not cover earthquakes, floods or hurricanes, they\'re "acts of Nature".

I pay about $44 per month for this coverage.

My auto insurance covers similar problems, but since collisions with other
moving objects is much more likely, I pay about $90 per month for this
coverage, also with a $500 deductable.

These work out to about .001 of the insured value per month.  That\'s too
high for anon-canon expense, so I am probably going to use an order less
than that; .0001 of the value.  That works out to Cr. 75k per month or 900k
per year.  not too bad.  The other wya would be adding 9 Mcr per year,
making profits even further away.

So here\'s my take on Starship Insurance;

- ----Begin Insurance Clause----

Starburst Mutual Insurance Co.  A Division of Ling Standard Product LIC.

Coverage: This policy will reimburse the policy holder for up to the
replacement value of the vessel (depreciation at 1% per year, assuming
regular maintanence) for damage or loss as a result of collision, acts of
piracy, failure of properly maintained equipment, vandalism, acting to aid
another craft in danger, theft, accidents where neglect has not been
proven, and such other events not specifically excluded below that are not
a result of willful negligence on the part of the policy holder.

Exclusions: This policy shall not reimburse the policy holder for damage
resulting from acts of war, acts of nature, damage resulting from actions
which willfully and intentionally put the insured property in danger
(except where acting to preserve life or property of higher value or need,
in an emergency situation), or damage resulting from neglect of proper
safety or maintanence procedures.

Deductable: The Policy Holder shall be responsible for the first Cr 5,000
worth of damage resulting from a claim.  This is a per incident deductable.

Payment:  This policy costs $.0001 per month of the insured value of the
property.  Payable at any LSP Payment Center available at most Imperial A
and B Class Starports.

Nope. Psi powers are not hereditary. It says so right in the Zho Alien
module. Which makes me wonder...

If we assume that there are two ways to become a Zho noble:

 - be the child of a noble, with or without psi powers
 - be elevated to noble status via hig psi strength

then how come the whole Zhodani populace haven\'t become nobles
over the centuries?

Because I was trying to keep the cost down to something less than a billion
credits.  This isn\'t a top of the line navy ship, it\'s the moral equivalant
of a M-113 APC: cheap and effective.

So do I I I (slap!).  *ahem*  So do I, but space became a consideration.
When I was done, I had about 1 cubic meter of waste space left, and a ship
that exceeded the design specs.

If I wear to go over the design, I\'d probably cut acceleration to 1G, and
upgrade the armanment.

T5 is Marc\'s working title for the next edition.  Originally called T4.1,
the complete melt down of Imperium Games caused him to bump up a full
version number.  AFAIK, Marc is still writing the rules, and shopping
around for a publisher.

>What is the main difference between FF&S1 (with corrections) and FF&S2?

FFS2 is the canon design sequence for T4.  It was worked on by actual
engineers and such, so gives good "hard" science results.  It\'s also wider
in scope, allowing variant systems for life support and the like.  There is
an excellent spreadsheet available for building starships with FFS2:

http://www.ames.net/igor/traveller/index.htm

Right now, we\'re waiting for news from Marc about T5.  Also, Steve Jackson
Games is releasing GURPS:Traveler in about two weeks.  Set in an alternate
timeline where Dulinor is killed (or is he?) before he can assassinate
Strephon.  A series of sourcebooks is planned.

Depends on who you talk to.  My campaign is set in the Classic era, but I\'d
probably change Virus a great deal before using it.  Some people like it,
some people hate the idea.  It\'s one of topics we\'ve down to death on the

your game.

I don\'t doubt that the capabilities of low berth can be misused, especially
by a merc company working on the edge of profit.  The design intention was
to reduce the travel time (and life support costs) of encountered when
transporting a unit from it\'s base of operations (where the troops would
actually spend most of their time) to the staging orbit.

One point I neglected to mention about this class, it\'s extensive batteries
allow it 40+ hours of operation in a zero emcon (no emmissions) status.

What I\'ve "heard" (purely rumor) is the dimming is used to help passengers
maintain their night vision, thereby reducing the chance of injury in case
they need to evacuate the plane upon landing. Of course, if passengers *do*
need to evac do to a problem during landing, maintaining their night vision
is usually the least of their problems.

Well, there\'s typically a lot of black magic involved in the computations, but
the basic rule of thumb is that the cost of insurance will exceed the average
expected payouts -- so the insurance company makes its own estimate of how
likely being forced to pay how much actually is, and then charge enough that by
the time on average it has to pay, it will have received more money in payments
than it will have to pay out.

This is likely to depend considerably on (a) what kind of damage we\'re talking
about, (b) what the player expects to _do_ with the starship, and (c) where the
starship is likely to be operating.  For example, if you are carrying cargos
through a warzone where commerce raiders have a 10% chance of destroying
shipping, insurance will be _at least_ 75 million, and more likely 100 million,
_per voyage_.

Well, if on average one ship in a thousand per year will suffer a level of
damage sufficient to cause insurance to apply (or a larger percentage require
partial repairs), this is reasonable.  For safe routes in the inner sectors of
the Imperium, this may be reasonable.  For people doing the kind of interesting
stuff PCs are likely to want to do with starships, insurance in the value of 1%
per month (yes, substantially _higher_ than your interest payments) or higher
are appropriate....
Basically, if you figure that the PC is likely to _ever_ collect on the
insurance, the insurance should be quite expensive.

A typical deductible for a starship would probably be at least 1% of the value
of the vessel, at least if you want sane rates.  In general, for best rates you
want a deductible which is as high as you can afford to pay without otherwise
crippling your business.

9MCr on a 750MCr starship = 300kCr/year on a free trader

It does not sound too unreasonable, especially if you are a follower of the
"life support and cargo costs include insurance" school.

>So here\'s my take on Starship Insurance;

<snip>

>Exclusions: ... damage resulting from actions
>which willfully and intentionally put the insured property in danger

I\'m not convinced by the exception:
either the action won\'t be wilful (if the law is you must respond to a
distress call, then heading into a dangerous area to provide help
should not be covered by this exclusion anyway.)
or you\'ll probably have someone else to claim from so why worry.

Of course you\'ve missed the opportunity for the "Uninsured Loss recovery"
premium so that if someone else crashes into your spaceship,
your ULR policy pays for your repairs and then they claim against
the third party. If your party doesn\'t have lots of spare cash
lying around it could get them back in trading a lot sooner with
less risk of going bankrupt waiting for the consequential loss payouts.

Hmmm, speaking of consequential loss...how about something about
getting repairs done in a timely fashion with an approved repairer,
just so the PCs don\'t sit around letting the insurers pay all their
expenses whilst they adventure on planet.

Also, you might want to add a limited liability against cargo values
(and people) so that you don\'t bankrupt the insurers with a 
trillion credit cargo.

Finally, I had an uncle who was an engineer for an insurance company
- - he inspected any machinery that the company insured
(annually I think). It would probably be part of the annual
maintenance schedule since it would take about two weeks for
a team of engineers to inspect your starship.

Fail the insurance inspection and no insurance.

No insurance and the bank can\'t guarantee to get their money back
so they want repaying immediately.

Replaying the bank means your character gets a 3GCr bill from the bank
 => instant bankcruptcy.

Actually, this would be a TL 8 filter mask.  I doubt you would try and
recharge the LiOH in place.  Just send the old cartridge back and get
a new one.

At higher TLs I think you would use something along the lines of a "molcular
sieve" (zeolites with channels of a certain size in them, they will
hold molecules that fit in the channels preferentially).  A material
that absorbs pretty much just CO2, and releases it when heated, is
not that far fetched.

In all the flights (in the US) that have taken place at night, they dim the
cabin lights for passenger comfort only.

Don\'t think there is one.  Its just standard policy.

I suppose in case of accident, the strip lights to the emergency exits would
be more visible.

The key issue is, what are the odds of a loss?   (That is why Insurance
companies are so into statistics and why the often refuse to insure
when the risks are unkown).  Once you have the odds of the loss for
the period the premium covers, and you know what profit you want
to get out of the deal, the premium is....

Premium = Profit + (Odds of loss) x (Average Cost of a loss)

(if you wanted to get technical, it would be the sum of the odds
of each kind of loss times the cost of that loss).

To be honest, Alvin, given the way Eris has run the campaign so far, I
really didn\'t expect to waltz in, pick up the access codes to the Mae
Lee, flip the big red switch and gallivant off into the unknown.

I do have fears that when we get to Mark, we\'ll be drivven waaaaaay off

that "That pile over there is the Mae Lee...she\'s all yours, storage

I\'ll have to see if I can dredge up some pictures of the Air Force
boneyard here in Tucson. It\'s been the backdrop for a number of movies.
If anyone managed to stick with it till the end, the big battle in
"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man" takes place there. There are some
huge transports there with stub wings, no noses, and empty nacelles
where no-longer-in-production engines used to be.

That\'s what I\'m worrying about, not coming up with the bucks for a minor
refit...

Gotta wonder if that\'s not the _real_ reason that scout/couriers all
smell like old sneakers; and not crappy LS systems...;-)

I\'m not sure that it is a regulation, but I believe it is done to assist
the pilot by reducing the glare. They follow much the same practice when
docking ships I believe. That is they cloke over or obscure the forward
shining cabin lights. Such is the case here with ferry crossings
arriving in the evenings.

Mmmmmm.... sort of.  MT (and even GT) references used
the Imperiallines name to keep it familiar, but
when it was introduced in The Traveller Adventure,
it was implied that "Imperiallines" was just the
name the network operated under in the region
that included Aramis Subsector (parts of the Marches 
and Deneb?). Imperium-wide operations would mark
it as a Megacorporation, and that would give it
too high a profile for its intended functions.

Going by the original intent, it\'d be more accurate 
to say that, through a nigh-untracable maze of
holding companies, the Imperial family owns
a number of freight-only shipping companies.
(as a general guess, each of these has routes
across a one-half- to two-sector region, with
territories overlapping extensively, but all 
together they cover the entire Imperium. Routes
tend to be long, and the crew turnover rate is
just high enough that its no suprise if crew
from one ship don\'t know anyone from another
ship, even if they nominally work for the
same company.) All these companies -- by pure 
coincidence <wink wink> -- operate ships with 
the same standard design.

One of these companies, which has operations
in the Aramis subsector of the Spinward Marches,
is Imperiallines.

>It operates mainly as a typical
>transport line, but also has some jump-6 transport\'s

This is because it\'s _supposed_ to be the Imperial
family\'s covert courier network, with the long-
legged courier ships unobtrusively mixed in
with the normal cargo ships just going about
their mundane work. The companies\' operating 
procedures are arranged to make it easier for
the couriers not to stand out from the regular
transports.

Except that Imperiallines is supposed to look and 
operate like a regular civilian line, except for
the couriers, and even those **look** normal.

Good point\'s, esp. about the Director\'s/CEO\'s duties....

That "5 MCr" isn\'t profit but capital: it\'s a guesstamate on what the
typical wealthy family is willing to put at risk on entertaining peer\'s,
highly speculative spending, long-term project\'s, charitable donations,
venture\'s with no predictable return, or a return which is intangable or
very long term.

On second glance, 5 MCr capital exenditure is simply a ridiculous
expendeture for a family with 4 MCr of profit\'s coming in each year
from their 200 MCr corporation.  (Of course, there are those
wealthy folk who simply Don\'t Care...)

The company profit\'s are often used in part for capital
investment, dividend\'s, debt payment\'s, etc.: maybe 20% of the
corporate profit\'s actually return\'s to the family coffer\'s, assuming that
the family corporation is owned completely by the family
[ignoring the creditor\'s for the moment].

So, let\'s assume a 2% return on family holdings of 50 MCr.  Family
holdings (1 MCr) plus direct revenue stream from their corporation
(.8 MCr) = 1.8 MCr.  Assume that 10% of these return\'s are available
for adventuring: that\'s 180,000 Cr.  Not all *that* much....

It\'s difficult to imagine what impact such small fry as a 250 MCr family

level, never mind the top 1% of families in the Marches have.

Troop\'s - 1 MCr.  Equipment - 5 MCr  Equip. Maintenance - .25 MCr
Ten jump\'s per year - .04 MCr.  So far, that\'s 6.29 MCr.

 Warfare is rather expensive - just as well.....

At this point, I would suspect that Dulinor is indeed dead as ash.  For it
not to be Dulinor,

* It would have to be a look-alike entering the gig
or
* He will have to have some way of teleporting out of the gig,
  to get onto a jump capable ship, and flee the system without
  being detected.

I would rule out using a jet pack out of the gig: the exhaust
would have been detected, or the Archduke would have been
spotted.

TNS: "The unnamed source emphasized that investigators are still not
convinced that Dulinor was the target of the explosion..."

OK, now why would they NOT be convinced that Dulinor was the target?
Especially when they are certain that the explosion was
designed to kill?   They probably have additional information
that convinces them that Dulinor was not the target, info that the TNS
hasn\'t revealed.  What could this information be?  The questioning
of the Illeish Guard, INI info, combing through Dulinor\'s private
record\'s on the _Sargon_....

Hmm, the Recollet costs MCr 226 and already has space for 8 passengers - so
thats Officers Country.

The 60 Other Ranks go in bunks installed in the cargo hold, together with
42 dtons of military stores. The Recollet\'s integral electronic shop,
machine shop and sick bay will allow it to perform field maintainence and
support, while the streamlined hull and defenses (nuke damper, 2 250 MJ
lasers and sandcaster) will provide self defense capability. Ten low berths
will let you freeze combat casualties too hurt for the sick bay.

The Recollet\'s jump-3 capability will also help you get where you want to
be quickly, and a 20 dt launch for transporting troops around the planet
while the Recollet goes home for reinforcements. 

Ta-da, a mercenary cruiser for a reinforced company, and we still have
change from MCr 250.

Not at all. See, Alva\'s aunt promised her friend Bubbles that she would get
someone to look at the situation on Teiko. Now, whilst Alva\'s Aunt may only
have (say) MCr 5 tied up on Teiko, Bubbles and Bubbles\' friends may have a
lot more equity there - Alva\'s aunt is trying to do a favour for Bubbles.

A careful look at Bruce Macintosh\'s Defininite Sensor Rules indicates
contragravity is going to get used a lot less than we thought on the
battlefields of the Imperium.

See, the problem isnt that CG is expensive (it isnt, especially under FFS2)
but that C-G puts out gravity waves, and gravity waves can be detected by
specialised if not particularily expensive sensors.

This means that it is a lot easier to keep track of where grav tanks and
grav infantry are, which means life gets uncomfortable for them very very
fast.

Strange as it sounds, I think prop- and helicopters could actually be the
way to go in a high tech battlefield. C-G is more efficient, but it also
draws indirect fire like a dog draws fleas.

At TL-14 these become "Adaptive Contact Lenses" - cost Cr 5000.

I agree that this would count as a filter mask for purposes of the
definintion of a tainted atmosphere. Can you tell me how long "every
so often" is likely to be? I mean, theres a limit to how big a lump
of this lithium hydroxide stuff you can comfortably lug around on a
face mask. I realize that this would depend on the exact CO2 content,
but could you come up with some ballpark figures (and perhaps even an
estimate of the cost of replacement "loads")?

Would these lithium hydroxide slugs be reusable? That is, how big and
complicated an apparatus would you need to remove the CO2 from them?

CO2 absorbers used in circuit anaesthetic machines offer a useful
comparison.
Calcium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide in sodium and calcium
carbonate are packaged in small spheres to increase surface area.
(hydroxide + CO2 -> carbonate and water)
Anyway, four litres of beads last ninety days at twelve hours per day
usage.
This scales linearly (this is at basal ventilation ; twenty X faster
consumption rate at maximal exercise).
It costs about fifty dollars (Australian, therefore negligible hard
currency) per refill. ;-)

To recycle these, you would need a strong alkaline solution to reverse
the reaction. You could probably adapt the ship\'s Sabatier reactor (I
assume this is part of every ship\'s extended life support system, or a
descendant thereof) if you\'re really desperate. The ship\'s lab would
certainly have the equipment to do the trick (fume cupboard, heating
apparatus, resistant containers)...

for a DM to come up with a never ending expense list on a planetary 
scale.

As previously noted by another poster, it would be very easy for the 
PC\'s to fall into nothing but financial record keeping and high 
political role playing.  I have found it to be just as easy to keep 
the PC\'s interested in low level play by virtue of events that happen 
to their assets and extended families/contacts.  It can be very 
satisfying switching between high and low level play, as one session 
can contain events on the planetary/subsector scale as well as and 
assasination attempt on a PC by disgruntled politicos.

This type of campaign does require a fair amount of work for the 
referee, but I have come up with random event charts for the world, 
subsector and sector as well as a fair system of determining 
financial gains/losses on a monthly or yearly basis.  By reducing the 
high finance to a few die rolls once in a while, it leaves us free to 
concentrate on the role playing instead of where the last credit 
goes.  Another option here is for the PC\'s to have good 
accountants/lawyers/agents on the payroll to handle all the details 
and the referee can just inform them of results periodically.  Of 
course this leaves open all kinds of hooks too, perhaps that 
accountant is doing double entry books or the agent works for a 
competing group as well.

In short, it is possible to enjoy a high finance game greatly, but it 
requires players who are capable of looking beyond personal wealth 
and a dedicated referee.

Well, one possibility is that grav belts are primarily used (in combat,
anyway) the way Heinlein\'s Mobile Infantry use the jets in their suits. 
You jump up, and the grav belt gives you a boost.  As you come back
down, the belt softens your landing.  This procedure not only keeps your
troops close to the ground (harder for an enemy to get line-of-sight on
them), but also reduces the gravity wave signature of the grav belt
itself.

For administrative movement, your grav-belt-equipped infantrymen can fly
at a reasonable clip.  If you have conventional transport that\'s faster,
obviously that would be a better solution than providing grav belts to
troops who don\'t need them.

IMTU, the only units routinely equipped with grav belts are jump troop
units in powered battle dress (such as the 1199th Imperial Jump Infantry
Regiment, commanded by one of my characters).  Given the difficulty of
including vehicles in the first wave of meteoric assault, these troopers
have a justifiable need for personal movement-enhancing equipment.  The
cost factor is not much of an issue, since these units _already_ have an
enormous cost-per-trooper for equipment and training, and are therefore
few and far between (IMTU, the 1199th is the only Imperial Army jump
troop unit in the Vilis subsector).  Dirty-nasty-leg units can be more
easily and cheaply equipped with vehicles, and therefore don\'t require
the additional expenses of grav belts and grav belt combat training.  Of
course, your mileage may vary....

Depending on your feelings about cyberware, you could have "Perfect Lenses"
for your eyes. I would make these a lower TL than Adaptive Glasses and
Contacts, since they don\'t have to be quite so dynamic -- just flexible
enough for your muscles to manipulate them for focus.

A desire to maintain the status quo. It\'s pretty obvious from the
character generation tables that Zhodani society is able to
artificially produce/boost psionic abilities. The existence of
the Prole social class is being maintained artificially by the
so-called Nobility.

Evidence of this is the fact that Proles with a PSI rating of 8
or less *cannot* receive psi training even when promoted to
officer rank. This is despite the fact that a number of rolls
on psionic talent tables result in "PSI +1". In the Consulate
Navy, a character can even be sent to Psionic School where they
simply roll 1d6 on the Psi Skills table to get a skill they
didn\'t get during childhood training, *including Special*. So
                                                 ^^^^^^^
it\'s very possible for a character to start with a PSI of, say,
6 and increase it to 15 in 6-7 terms, if the training limitation
was ignored.

Prole education opportunities are also artificially limited.
Once a Prole becomes skilled in one of a few select skills,
he/she is fairly limited by chargen rules to specializing
in that one skill.

Proles are simply non-psionic Zhodani protected by the psionic
nobility? Yeah, right. A gilded cage is still a cage.

It\'s possible that the person requesting this feature simply wants to
have stats for a playable space combat game.  After all, the combat
rules in the basic T4 rulebook are not well-suited to actions involving
non-QSDS ships.

If that\'s the case, then an easier solution might be to get Bruce Alan
Macintosh\'s permission to post his "Military Combat System" rules on
your Web site.  This has several advantages:

1.  Your spreadsheet already supports MCS, with its CUSP worksheet;

2.  Bruce would be able to get more play-test feedback, since more
people would have the rules;

3.  It would save a _lot_ of time and effort;

4.  You wouldn\'t need to change your focus on supporting T4/FF&S2.

BTW, is there a shortcut to upgrading ship designs from previous
versions of your spreadsheet?  Most of my designs were done on version
2.6, and retyping the information (as a baseline) is a nuisance (though
not _nearly_ so much of one as pencil-and-paper ship designing would be!
:-P).

<<snip>>

If you were to do a pre-FF&S2 design spreadsheet, you\'d probably have
more interest in a High Guard version (IMO).

Nice workmanlike piece of science fiction.

A couple of questions came to mind while reading it 
and then the subsequent discussion with my traveller
group.

1.    It\'s Got Shields!. Has anyone on the \'list come up with
the mechanics that provide for shield technology that works
as simply as the novel contends?

2.     Is it (shield tech) canonically servicable? I know that this 
novel is tacitly approved by Marc. However, after looking 
over the extant info, I\'m a bit at a loss to come up with shield
tech details.

I found out that the graphic and copy shop next to my apartment building

a bit unruly.  Any interest in blank sector posters?  I will probably make

from Mr. Miller to make them available.  But let me finish my blanks first. :-)

the shields appeared to be meson screens, the turret weapons were called
meson guns

the novel also appeared to be a later time period than T4

Wouldn\'t hurt.  But it isn\'t absolutely necessary.  Annti Lahiten has a fine

that says T4 is the bottom of *his* priorites, so it might not be accurate.
I\'m pretty sure he has FF&S 2 (since the latest "relic builder" is mostly
based off\'ve FF&S 2 hull forms), which Annti prefers because he says he can
model airflows or something like that.

Mmm... It wouldn\'t be true FF&S 1 valid if that\'s what u mean, but BL/BR stats

summarize the relevant bits.

On grav plates being pairs of plates instead of a single plate:

I wanted to limit the effects of artificial gravity - specifically, I wanted to
prevent the situation where a flip of a switch turns a corridor into a
5G bottomless pit. If you can put the "bottom" plate at the aft end of the
corridor, and the "top" plate at the fore end of the corridor, and thus
make a thirty or forty meter gravity field, owch! Worse owch if you
can make it 5 or 10 G\'s.

Since I wanted to limit how "long" the gravity field could be, I decided
on a single plate. This allows high-ceilinged compartments without
them having to be broken up by grav plates - it\'s just that near the
ceiling, the gravity effects will peter out. 

As for Inertial Compensators opposing forces instead of neutralizing
forces:

If inertial comp automatically puts a 6G "push" on everything to counter
a 6G "pull" from thrust or maneuver, then you have a system that can
pop 6G\'s of force onto anything in the ship, instantly and at will. 
It should be child\'s play to rework such a system so that it applies
that force where you want it to, instead of automatically in synch
with thrust/maneuver (/collision?). Say, upside the head of the guy
with the laser rifle. 

If inertial comp opposes forces, but only works on the entire ship at
once, you still have tech that can do the above - a maneuvering
ship will inflict differing moments of force on people/objects in 
different parts of the ship, so it must be able to individually track each
item in the ship and differentially compensate for each. If it can do that,
you should be able to tell it to differentially compensate Freddy\'s head
over there. *Whack!*

And if you have such a system, why not make it portable? Such 
a peoplewhacker could come in handy.

I defined it as a neutralizer, much like antigrav neutralizes gravity
or jumpspace neutralizes distance. (Well, OK, Jumpspace is more
complex than that, but the level of natural law violation is similar.)
Nothing in the ship is affected by any moments of force from the outside,
so it works without any fine-tuning or high-gain internal sensors.

As for the entertaining example of killing an enemy boarding party
with a swimming pool:

All pressure-tight hatches IMTU will not open to a high pressure
differential - whether it\'s vacuum on the other side or deep water.
Depending on the design of the door, it will either take wrecking the
sensors or wrecking the door to make it open (some doors are
mechanically unable to open to a high pressure differential).

You can open such a door, but you\'ll have to fix it afterwards - unless
you deliberately designed the door to be openable to vacuum
or deep ocean, say as a deathtrap. I don\'t see many ships having
deathtraps as part of the design, though we can of course leave these
for intrepid PC\'s to cobble together....

I tried designing some missiles for use against starships, using the
starship design rules around TL5-8.  ( A sort of long range
planetary defence missile) Without using fusion rockets or
better I could hardly get them into orbit.   Without CG it waas truly
hopeless.  Saturn Vs do not even get off the ground.  This seems to be
both a function of the enormous fuel consumptions of these rockes, and
also because gravity does not drop off with the square of
distance.  It is impossible to produce one G for one hour so far
as I can tell.  Am I completely confusede about this?

Sure, as soon as I get a chance to type them up (within a week or 
so), also some are fairly specific to my campaign but obviously they

Well currently there are two double agents from a rival corp in the 
next subsector over that hired on as knowledgeable researchers who 
are actually in the process of stealing the PC corps stutterwarp 
research (nothing like a free lunch) as well as passing sensitive 
trade info back to the people they REALLY work for.  One black ops 
spy was caught by the PCs after rigging a jump engine failure on a 
liner carrying the lead council member from their planet to the 
United Worlds (the pocket empire) yearly military council.  The 
Regency is hotly involved with the United Worlds about incorporating 
them into the fold before they get too large to deal with 
diplomatically.
Anyway, i could go on and on with the plot twists and counter plots, 
but this level of play can be highly rewarding when the PCs are free 
to engage in top level politics or uplift missions etc without having 
to worry about where the next cred or ship payment is coming from.  
This does take mature players however, our group has been together 
for 6+ years and this is the first campaign of the type we have 
undertaken.  It has run for about a year now and does not show any 
signs of slowing down as the stakes get bigger and plot threads from 
months ago return and resolve.  It does take a lot of commitment on 
the referees part as you are not dealing with a specific mission most 
times, but trying to coordinate events on a world/subsector/sector 
basis.
I will post my event and finance charts soon.

Don\'t be fooled by glossy magazine paper (that you know will rip after the
third reading) and the very expensive photographs throughout the book.
Maybe its a great game, but its look turns me off as too glossy and
overpriced.  Especially since most of the cash price has to go to those
photographs and glossy pages with Okuda-grams and _not_ to the game
designers.  Alternity "looks" pretty good, but IMHO, its a huge
Traveller/Gurps ripoff, with overly complex game mechanics, and just a
general lack of original character (which is too bad, as I used to talk
occasionally with its designers and expected something of a much higher
overall quality).

Just by way of comparison, The Morrow Project looks like something made
with a production budget of $2.00, but actually has some very interesting
elements.  how many games have in their core rules radioation sickness
rules?  (ok, a couple, but you get my point).

I\'d be very much interested in your analysis after playing it for a few
weeks.
I can\'t bring myself to purchase it yet.

Does this mean that all journeys with the warp drive take no time, or there is no relativistic time dilatation ? Can any ship travel six parsecs in about a week (say) ?
I take it \'real thrusters\' are reaction drives. Fair enough, now that you don\'t need all the LH2 for the jump drive, you can run your HePlaR for days, and have more cargo/whatever space...
It might make a useful design variant.

Low berth is a useful plot device. It offers cheap (albeit a little risky) interstellar travel, and one-way time travel. Major trauma victims can be put into stasis pending definitive treatment (need resuscitation before being put into cold sleep).
\'Fast berthing\' is something that I don\'t like the concept of. In our society, it wouldn\'t pass any ethics committee or pharmaceutical evaluation committee unless it was strictly earmarked for theatre or ICU use on the anaesthetised....

Depends on your edition of Traveller :- (I haven\'t read the book...)
Prior to T4 (rest in pieces), I believe the options were as follows :-
i. Electrostatic shielding :- objects that broach a low-voltage static field cause an accumulator bank to discharge a high-voltage pulse into the offending bomb, bullet or plasma bolt... ; (FF&S1, TL 9+)

ii. Sand casters :- prismatic aerosol designed to sacrificially absorb laser wavelengths. On a smaller scale, this is available in spray cans for personnel (Little Black Book 4 : Mercenary) ;

iii. Force Fields :- black and white globes. Any object intersecting the globe moving from outside to inside has its (kinetic) energy drained. The resulting cryogenic lump usually shatters (metals) or impacts uselessly on the protected object\'s hide.
Atmospheric use is problematic. You can\'t see out of a black globe (unless you strobe it).
The drained energy is accumulated in a capacitor bank in the protected volume.
White globes are really nifty. You can see and fire out, but the bad guys can\'t shoot at you. This is really high tech (TL 20+).

iv. Others : nuclear dampers, meson screens, proton screens for antimatter missiles (the last at TL 19+ in MegaTraveller).

v. In T4, magnetic shielding is mentioned in the Central Supply Catalog vehicle design section. This is similar to electrostatic shielding, but a lattice built in to the hull generates an intense magnetic field, which deflects any charged or magnetic (ferro-, para- and dia-) particle that intersects it. TL 12+
This makes a perfect radiation shield for space travellers. Hull maintenance becomes important, but EVAs become hazardous. (?MR scanner+ field strengths [1-2 Tesla - Earth\'s field roughly 10^(-7) Tesla!] over hull - metallic implants get moved around your body, electronics don\'t work....)
I\'d turn it off on re-entry.
Oxygen is paramagnetic, so use in an atmosphere could be a problem.

  Nice try, "Mr. Newman", if that\'s your real name. However, at the time

Chevies don\'t have the sort of ground pressure a starship\'s landing
gear does.

Ships mass a *lot* more than anything we are used to dealing with
*except* ships and mining equipment. 

Even a measly 100 ton scout in the standard layout is in a world of
trouble if one of the "wheels" sinks. The stresses are not going to be
good for the hull, and the wheel assembly may well break. 

Figure the mass of the ship, divide by three (for the three
"supports"), then figure the contact area of each one. Divide the
*weight* (mass times gravity) by the contact area and you get the load
pressure. And it\'s rather more than anything *but* rock or a prepared
surface can handle.

Even an "airplane" layout has got *way* too much weight on a landing
leg/skid/wheel to avoid *serious* damage if one sinks. The torsion
(twisting) loads generated aren\'t something ships would be designed to
handle. They\'d be in different directions (and at different *points*)
than the loads encountered when manuevering.

BTW, the loads on the landing gear *don\'t* depend on the orientation of
the ship. Only the mass, and the area of the actual contact surfaces. 

> Leonard, are you saying that ships in your TU *never* land away from a
> starport? ;)

I\'m saying that starships don\'t land without checking how solid the
"ground" is anymore than ships enter an unknown harbor without checking
the depth soundings. In both cases, there results of being wrong mean
you are *stuck*.

Also, right *now* we\'ve got radar than can pentrate ground for a ways,
and return the profile of the rock underneath. Between that and using a
one of the ship\'s "small craft" to survey a landing site *before*
bringing down the ship, the "unexpected soft ground" bit is only going
to happen in the case where you had to make an emergency landing
without time to pick and choose. And that\'d be like the cause of a
seagoing ship having to try to beach itself rather than sink.

Yes. Too much CO2 causes problems. Partly because your body uses the
CO2 level rather than the 02 level to decide when you need to take a
breath. So you\'d start panting even though you *really* don\'t need to
breathe that fast. 

So you can suffer from hyperventilation, and at higher levels, you
start having problems with acidosis (the extra CO2 in the bloodstream
makes your blood too acid). And at some point, the CO2 in your blood
will have trouble leaving to get swapped for oxygen.

> 2)      can CO2 be filtered out by a simple filter mask?

More or less. Usually it\'s filtered thru something like lithium or
calcium hydroxide, which by absorbing it turns to the carbonate.

Carbon monoxide doesn\'t have to be very high at all to be a problem.
You see, what it does is bind to hemoglobin in much the same way that
CO2 or O2 do. The problem is that it binds *too* well. Once a CO
molecule has bound to a hemoglobin molecule, it doesn\'t let go. So that
molecule quits being involved in transfering O2 to your Cells and CO2
from them.

So the useless hemoglobin sticks around taking the place of hemoglobin
that could be doing something. And it stays until the red blood cell in
question gets recycled by your body (they last several days as I
recall). 

The effects are as if there was less oxygen in the air. At a quite low
concentration, you start acting slow & stupid. As the concentration
rises, your reflexes get worse and you get slower and dumber. Finally
you pass out and die.

Having natural concentrations that high isn\'t likely, as CO isn\'t long
term stable in the presence of oxygen (it gets convert to CO2). And if
there are life forms, they\'ll be several (probably bacteria)
cheerfully converting it to CO2 even faster, and using the energy
gained to run their life processes.

So as a natural taint, it\'d either be short lived. But as an industrial
one, it could hang around longer, because it\'d be getting produced in
such large quantities. Though then you have to justify *why* they are
letting it get produced. Any process producing CO is *not* running
properly. It\'s a product of incomplete combustion, anmd thus, in any
*industrial* process, it\'s a big loss of energy. 

Cars produce it only because the Internal combustion engine makes such
lousy use of fuel.

BTW, a protective mask for CO would contain some sort of catalyst which
would encourage it to react with the oxygen in the atmosphere and
convert to CO2.

Check with a your local industrial safety agencies, and they should
have literature giving the safe exposure levels for a *lot* of gases,
including CO2 and CO. 

You might also try a web search for "material safety data sheets" these
are required in the US for industrial use of just about *anything* and
give lots of useful info. I\'m pretty sure that there are web sites with
them available for downloading. And the various chemicals should give
refs lots of nasty ideas.

Remember, plants convert CO2 to sugars. Some they burn for enery,
returning the CO2 to the atmosphere. The rest winds up as cellulose (ie
biomass). High CO2 levels will encourage plant growth, but they won\'t
reduce it all that fast. And when the plant dies, decay will turn much
of the cellolose into CO2 and the rest into biomass in the deacy
organisms. And when *they* die, they cycle repeats.

The amount of carbon is *constant*. The carbon cycle on a planet has
CO2 in the atmosphere, carbonate ions in the ocean, and carbonate rocks
on or near the surface. When subducted, the rocks release the CO2,
which returns to the atmosphere and oceans via volcanic activity.

When you add life, you get plants turning CO2 into biomass. And
microrganisms turning carbonate ions into calcium carbonate shells
(ditto for animals like clams and coral). That increases the formation
of limestone, which eventually gets subducted. And biomass recycles
carbon, except when conditions lead to the formation of coal (and
possibly oil[1]) deposits. Those take longer to recycle.

So for example, it\'s virtually *certain* that Earth had a *much* higher
CO2 level in the atmosphere before the big coal deposits were laid down.

And when on a solid surface, each "leg" would be supporting 228 tons.
The apparent contact area looks to be less than a square meter. But
let\'s say it is.

228 tons * 9.8 m/s^2 = 2234.4 kN

So we have a ground pressure of 2234.4 kN/m^2.

You get the same load by putting 22.8 kg on a 1cm square support.
Or by putting about 324 pounds on a one inch square support. That\'s
gonna sink in most ground...

I\'ve mentioned the Shuttle elsewhere, let\'s just say that it lands
parallel because at the time we couldn\'t build it any other way. And it
was originally intended to *take off* horizontally!.

We have since *built and flown* designs that take off *and land*
vertically. 

> 3) the vessel can still land with inoperable drives

It\'s got the same problem the Shuttle does. Without power, that hull
will glide like a brick. It won\'t handle at all like it does under
power. And you\'ll get one and only one chance to land.

Also, lifting body designs *don\'t* need even as much wing as the
Shuttle has. It was just easier. I expect that mercants would use true
lifting bodies more simply because there\'s less waste space. Also, you
*want* such designs to be tail heavy, as it makes trimming them for
glide easier. 

I\'ve got an old model rocket that uses a lifting body design. It\'s a
sort of rounded triangle cross-section (imagine the rotor from a
Wankel engine, with the corners rounded off). It glides nicely, and
would have a *lot* less wasted space than a winged design.

The best shape for a VTVL ship is a wide cone with a rounded nose and
base (take a cone and chop it off a third of the way from the top and
stick a hemisphere there).

And if you build it with allowances for such, it could make an
unpowered water landing. It\'d "splash down" much like an early space
capsule. Heck, if parachute materials are up to it, it might even be
able to make a landing on solid ground the way the Russian capsules
did. The "emergency re-entry shielding" would even double as ablative
armor on the stern. Great for when you are trying to run away from an
attacker. :-)

For that matter, give it the "rounded triangle" cross section, and in
an emergency, everybody straps in, and you glide the damn thing until
you are low and slow enough to set it down on its tail. Sure, any loose
gear will slide all over the place. But the cargo should be tied down
well enough to handle it anyway (except for "this end up" stuff :-)

BTW, I consider the needle design to be a lousy choice for *anything*
except a ship built around a *big* spinal mount. It\'s just too
susceptible to "bending" stresses.

No, no, they take you to the highport, and shuttle you over to the
parking orbit they stick all that stuff in. "That hunk of junk is
yours...."

Parking the stuff in orbit minimizes a lot of types of wear. Also, why
land it when you\'ll only have to haul it (or the parts from it, if you
are stripping it) back into orbit. 

Also, it may have been parked in orbit because the hull integrity
wasn\'t up to a landing. :-)

That\'s because it has to *glide* to land. Note that the designs for
craft intended to land under power (such as the DC-X) *don\'t* resemble
airplanes. They take off *and* land vertically. 

And frankly, the reasons that a vertical take-off horizontal landing
design got chosen for the Shuttle replacement is most a case of folks
wanting to stick with what they know, and a lot of politics.

But that makes some of the accesses on the "top" or "bottom", which
makes working on them a lot harder than simply being able to walk all
around the segment. I\'d say that it\'s *easier* to work on a spinal
mount that runs *through* decks instead of *along* them. After all, the
way they work, the active components are "rings" around the shaft.

Ok, on a lot of planes much of the internal power comes from an
"auxiliary power unit" (basicly a small jet turbine hooked up to a
generator) somewhere in the fuselage.

I can see them shutting that down to reduce the fire hazard from and
accident during landing.

I agree. If he was trying to fake his death, then it wouldn\'t have been
*that* hard to have enough of the right sort of DNA onboard the craft
when it blew (blood, plus some cloned organs). After all, he wouldn\'t
*want* there to be any doubt that they "gotten" him.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I was picturing working segments that took up more than 3-6 meter
segments of the spinal mount\'s length - situations where it was easier
to work on twenty meters or more of the spinal mount at once. Sure, 
you\'d have catwalks taking you up the sides of the spinal mount,
but the room you\'re working in doesn\'t have to be a ship-long pit.

I see most large spinal-mount ships as being better built as skyscraper
designs, I\'m just trying to explain the _Sylea_ class battleship.
As pictured in CT _Library Data A-M_, she appears to be built with
airplane-style deck configurations.

Here\'s an idea: You get intertial comp and contragrav at TL-8 to TL9.
How much later do you get the ability to build 100,000dtn ships?
(At work, don\'t have my CT High Guard with me - I think TL12)
Contragrav and intertial comp were, perhaps, such mature and
dependable technologies by the time 100,000tn ships were built
that it really didn\'t matter what orientation they used?

Thought of a reason for airplane-style decks on a midsize ship:
loading/unloading of small craft. Most small craft use airplane-style
decks, they land like airplanes. Since these small craft have significant
length, it\'s difficult to dock them oriented differently than the thrust axis
of the mother ship (for medium-sized mother ships). There would also
be maneuver problems - when the small craft has to catch up to you,
then maneuver perpendicular to direction of travel? Docking paralell to 
direction of travel sounds less complex to me, but I\'m no orbital mechanic.

Dock them oriented paralell to thrust, now open the cargo bay/passenger 
compartment on the small craft. Let\'s see the difference mother ship deck 
orientation makes:

If you have decks on the mother ship perpendicular to thrust, you\'re faced
with loading a high, narrow cargo bay. You have to reorient the passengers\'
"up" 90 degrees when they board (annoying/disconcerting for people
who just left a planet, if they\'re not professional spacers). The hangar bay
takes up multiple decks, meaning that multiple decks have the 
integrity risk of having a compartment regularly exposed to vacuum
on that deck - you\'d rather have such a hangar bay limited to one
deck, I think it would be safer and more secure.

If the decks on the mother ship are paralell to thrust, loading and
unloading cargo and passengers from a small craft is trivial - open
the cargo door, the cargo is much more accessible. 

The _Broadsword_ merc cruiser uses perp-to-thrust decks and
paralell-to-thrust docking for the cutters. Works, but you get the
pleasure of having to combat-check and load the ATV\'s in either
zero-G or while it\'s sitting on it\'s tail - neither one a real good choice.

_Azhanti High Lightning_ has all craft (Fuel Shuttles, Fighters,
Cutters) sitting on their tails with decks 90 degrees from the ship
decks - I don\'t even see how any cargo is loaded on the cutters,
they must load all cargo in zero-G from the cargo deck transfer locks.
An extra layer of complexity, but the boat deck on AHL seems pretty
well secured - a good tradeoff, I suppose for a combat ship.

Btw, speaking of the AHL - someone mentioned how hard it was to
move 500 troops the length of the hull with those dinky elevators,
how much easier it would be to move them through bow-to-stern
corridors. AHL may have those, if you\'re willing to move your troops
through zero-G vacuum: the spinal mount tube and fighter tubes.
Access is a little limited, but in a "repel boarders" situation you\'re
probably not using either of them anyway.

Invading troops might use them as well...well, maybe not. The defenders
might not be able to fire the spinal mount, but they might be able
to turn it on. That might be bad for a commando team trying to sneak up
the shaft....

As for elevators, check out the deckplans for Enterprise-D from
Star Trek NextGen. It nicely details ideas for turbolift shafts on a big
ship - how the turbolift system is really like a subway system, with
side tracks and more than one car per track. There are even holding
areas for spare cars, and a "pass through" link so the turbolift
system on Enterprise-D can become linked to the turbolift system
of a starbase - take one car directly from your engineering station to
that nice dining hall on spacedock when you\'re in port.

Ideas like these, especially multiple elevators per shaft, can really
speed up people moving through big skyscraper-style ships.

Of course, the system is presented in deck plans for a ship with
an airplane-style deck plan.... <g>

I don\'t have my book handy but FFS mentioned that the surface area requirements
for contragrav lifters (I think) included landing skids.  That should give you a
good number to figure out surface area on landing gear.

Well, I haven\'t read the book or studied the game mechanics (as most people
who know me on this list will attest are very important to me), so I can\'t
comment on the ST:TNG game rules.

But...I\'m still interested in the book.  From what I saw, it was very well
designed, and it looks as if a lot of time and effort went into content as
well as presentation.

Just because a book looks great doesn\'t mean that it\'s automatically going to
have a great game system (and the opposite is true as well).

My comment is that it is obviously a slick, packaged deal aimed at selling
some copies--keeping this dying hobby alive.  I took that as a heartbeat in an
obviously flat-lined industry.

It is a good sign, and I\'m happy to see it.

This is true. By "nothing in canon depends..." I meant that they could just
as easily have been designed differently from the start. I don\'t suggest
rewriting all the existing deck plans. My intention was to correct what I
felt were false statements about the effects of deck orientation, and try
to convince some of the referees and ISBA designers to use a perpendicular
orientation.

This is a valid point for a large ship with any kind of deck orientation.
IMTU "elevators" are independently maneuverable cars that travel in
evacuated tubes, the way I had envisioned Star Trek\'s turbolifts worked
until TNG scotched that idea. In any case, paired shafts and/or
interchanges are necessary to allow cars moving in opposite directions to
pass each other. The same principle can be used to move horizontally.

Another possible technology is an "escaladder", like a vertical escalator.
An infinite belt of platforms moves up one side and down the other. The
platforms slide up on the belt when approaching a floor and down when
leaving it, so passengers have a longer time to enter ot leave a platform.
I am not a fan of the zero G vertical shafts some times seen in SF.

The detail in the AHL plans is insufficient to determine the layout of
ladders, but IMHO even a gymnast would find it difficult to travel that far
on ladders. Building codes in the IN must be pretty lax.

As others have noted, there were problems with FFS1\'s rocket rules:

(1) Fuel consumptions are too low
(2) Thrust-to-weight is also too low (these kind of cancel out)
(3) Delta-V is figured out in somewhat the wrong way. (The "break the fuel
up into 10% chunks) is sort of tolerable, but one should really use the
log(mass fraction) formula you can find on 
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller
way back in his archives
(3) All the nonsense about using 1G of thrust to cancel out gravity is 
basically wrong (rockets need to accelerate upwards initially, but real
trajectories are much more complicated and efficient than using 1G to "hover"
while the remaining Gs push you forward
(3) The G-hours to orbit numbers in FFS1 are way to high (real values would
be about 9-10 km/s including extra delta-V needed for atmospheric drag
losses and "gravity losses" (the amount of thrust that really is needed to
go upward.

All that being said, no modern rocket can generate 1G for 1 hour even today
(without many many stages and a tiny payload); that\'s 36 km/s, which is a
lot. We can barely begin to imagine making single stages today with about 
10km/s.

FFS2 overall does this somewhat better - the rocket fuel consumption
numbers (as corrected in the errata) are based on realistic technology. 
(The web page given above has some realistic values for FFS1.) 

I have a couple of TL8 designs that can make orbit that I can email to anyone
interested (an AZHRAE aerospaceplane from FFS1 and a hybrid chemical/nuclear
design from FFS2.)

The best (IMHO) sf mini rules are Dirtside II and Stargrunt from Ground
Zero Games.

DSII is designed for 1:300 scale battles with company/battalion scale
forces.  SG is a 25mm scale game of squad level combat.  Both games focus
on the importance of command, and have a good feel for modern combat (long
range fire between infantry only supresses the opponent, you have to get in
close to kill them, for example.)

The rules are simple, and quickly learned.  Both games include vehicle
design systems.  DSII has a points system for building armies, while SG
just allows you to set up scenarios as you wish.

I agree that the landing legs in the published material are too small,
IMTU the landing legs are much larger.  My concern is that tail landing
a scout will have too small a footprint and a large "sail" area.  Scout
ships are to be capible to land at class E and X starports, these may
not have level bedrock, thus making tail landing unsafe.

Free traders and far traders may also call on these starport classes.

I\'m partial to the original Striker rules, myself.

However, for stuff that is still in print - get a copy of DirtSide II by
John Tuffley.  You can get a copy at the Geo-Hex/GZG games site:
http://www.geohex.com/gzgindex.htm

DirtSide II uses 1/300 scale minis for larger \'epic scale\' battles.
Each infantry stand is a fire team of 4-5 individuals, each vehicle mini
is one vehicle.  Complete rules for combat, vehicle design, etc.  These
rules are clean and play fast.  It would be childishly easy to use these
rules for battles in the Traveller universe.  They work even better for
2300AD.

StarGrunt II is the 25mm version of DirtSide II.  Using a very similar
system, it focuses on the \'skirmish\' scale fights.  One figure is one
trooper, one vehicle = one vehicle.

Both games are excellent, and the GZG mini\'s are perfect for Traveller
use.

Well, now that I have access to my books, I see that contragrav lifters
account for 10% of the surface area of the ship.  This includes landing
skids. Thus a 100 dT scout should have a surface area of 900 sq.M. and 90
sq. M of landing surface. That makes each foot (I\'m assuming a tripod) 30 sq
M.  Significantly more than a sq. meter each.

Of course some of the contragrav lifter surface area may not be skid/landing
gear.  But I can counter that by saying that the feet expand when deployed.

While waiting for a fellow player in a bookstore I leafed through the new
Alternity alien book. Not bad. Not bad at all. I have the Player\'s Handbook
and the DM\'s Guide, but have only had time to go through the PH. It has
some, well, interesting mechanics (you use a +/- _dice_ to modify your
basic d20 roll, rather than a fixed modifier). Overall I found it\'s
similarly to D&D rules and stats to be useful. It gave me an immediate
frame of reference in which I could evaluate rules.
I\'m not sure it will go anywhere. I\'m not sure any new game will go
anywhere. (The ST book you describe sounds like a coffee table collectable,
not a RPG.) But there are ideas I would steal for traveller. Not the
setting, though. The setting sucks.

moves the same. Neutralizing such a force in real space is impossible.
Since Traveller is fiction this is entirely up to you, but I try to not
violate physic if I can.  
   Whether or not gravity can be neutralized is unknown, but I believe
it is impossible as well.  Even in intergalactic space, there is
gravity.

A long-body ship makes a hard pivot, spins in place. People near the
center of the ship are affected far less than people at the bow, or stern.

A ship rolls hard to expose an undamaged weapon battery. People near
the spine of the ship will be affected less than people near the outer hull.

The entire ship may "move the same", but the people inside will be
different distances from the axis of motion and direction of acceleration
depending on what\'s going on and where they are at the moment.

The only way for an inertial compensator to work so people won\'t notice
any movement, _and_ not build a system that lets an engineer slap
people around like high-tech telekinesis, is to make the system produce
a ship-wide field that damps or neutralizes acceleration without actually
generating any perceptible force of it\'s own - the energy must be
neutralized.

I realize this is black-box tech, not readily explainable with common
physics. Neither is jump drive, anti-gravity, or a bunch of other canon
things.

My explanation was geared towards making an environment where
the ship\'s engineer can\'t massacre all enemy boarding parties on
any ship just by hitting a few buttons.

Which is one reason I have ships do a lot of water landings.  Downports
are often on rivers, lakes or bays and lacking those in large
artificial basins.  Yes, ships can land...on land, but generally
must keep their CG powered up while down to prevent sinking into the
ground.

I really dont like this ship.

The complement is very small - 30 troops for a MCr 900 ship, and the gees
arent that impressive. Defensive armament is OK. Personally, I\'d move the
troops from low berths to bunks.

The ship also looks overpowered - you arent going to be running the
thruster plates and jump drive simultaneously, and if you do have to make a
running jump, you can run one or the other out of that chunky battery
power. I\'d say you can lose at least 300 MW from the main power plant,
which will save space, mass and (most of all) money.

The 100 dton of cargo is a judgement call - personally, I\'d reduce it, and
add a machine shop and an electronics shop, on the grounds this will allow
field maintainence and repair, which will mean you need fewer spare parts.

The densitometer might be non-essential, but the neutrino sensor is a nice
touch - spot those nasty grav tanks, and then pepper them with combustion
laser missiles. You might think about a small, cheap radar jammer - not to
jam starship or ground defenses, but to jam radars on small craft and tanks.

The armour is very thick, which is a definite plus, but I dont like the
lack of sensor redundancy. I\'d add a couple of cheap PEMS and AEMS in case
you take some surface hits coming in.

For a bunch of reasons, I\'ve always liked auxilary power plants.

Another one is that while dirtside you can run the auxilary one to power
the contragravity, thus reducing the weight the lander legs have to
support. The main power plant is still offline, allowing the engineer to
tinker with it.

"The smallest power plant which may be installed on a ship in 
Traveller is a standard "A" power plan. The A-plant can consume 
20 tons of hydrogen over a period of a week, convert it to energy, 
and feed it to an "A" FTL drive. (This is how much energy is needed 
by the smallest FTL drive to make a jump of 1 parsec if installed in 
a 200 ton ship.) If we assume Miller is using metric tons (1 ton = 
1,000 kg), an A power plant then can deliver 380,000 MW-years 
of energy over a period of one week. Over a year, it could deliver 
19,800,000 MW-years. Thus, a single A power plant produces 
about 86 times as much energy in a year as all of the electrical 
generating plants in the United States. A single jump in Traveller 
uses about 160% of the energy the US produces in a single year. "

OK, I have heard that some folk here actually did model a 
universe where energy is *this* cheap.  How did that universe look like?
What was the consequences of ultra-cheap energy in a society?
What becomes cost-effective, and what simply isn\'t worth the time?
Does it change society as much as cheap nano-tech would?

Well, I have no artistic talent and no spare time... but another TML member
emailed me saying essentially the same thing.

Give me a week or so, and I\'ll try to put something together.

Right. Making one that looks like the classic scout/courier will be a
challenge, however, because of it\'s narrowness. I\'ll see what I can do.

The point is that not all of it gets returned.  Some if it gets
buried (that is why we have an oxygen atmosphere).  As you speed
up the rate as which CO2 gets fixed, you speed up the rate at
which it gets buried.  So the question is, is the current level
of CO2 what we "happened to end up with", or the level at which
plants stopped bringing down the CO2 level because it got too
difficult.

Actually, not all crust is subducted (the continents are too light,
that is why you have the Himalayas, neither India or Asia is
willing to be subducted).  In any case, the process is slow and
if you increase fixation, more carbon is sitting on the
"conveyor belt".  The question is, what is the limit?  It may
be that there is some fundamental limit and, as photosythesis
evolves, plants just keep bringing the level down and down until
you hit some sort of fundamental limit.

If I have time in a few weeks I\'ll see if I can\'t look up what
is known about CO2 level over the Earths history.

Well, technically, the doors in question weren\'t opened; they were blown,
with demo charges.  But point taken.

Note that your policy will also keep people from venting compartments to
space to put out shipboard fires... hope your fire-suppressant system
is up to snuff.

That wasn\'t quite my point.  I meant that even though a vehicle was
designed to be used in a certain environment, people still like to exceed
what the engineers originally had in mind.  And this would include 4x4\'ing
a Corvette or landing your Free Trader somewhere in the wilderness.  But I
get your point about the radar devices used by archeological digs, etc.

    'body' => 'Approved for release: Eqenden Industries

While the release of our SSgt Arden Stillwell has met with generally 
positive reviews, trials of the Mercenary Cruiser highlighted several 
weaknesses.  Therefore, in the spirit of producing the best product for the 
market, we are proud to announce the Phase II prototype, the Lt. Terry 
VonDamme.

Although the VonDamme is built on the same hull structure (800 Std, SL 
Sphere Hypersonic), the design requirement for the starship to land in a 
battlefield environment was removed.  This allowed us to lighten the ship 
considerably by removing half of the armor (AV of 40), which increases the 
top acceleration of the ship from 2.8 G to 3.0 G (unloaded).

But, just because the design parameter for battlefield landing was removed 
does not mean that the starship is unable to fight!  The re-evaluation of 
the starship was carried through to the weapon configuration, and in order 
to accentuate it\'s role as a orbital weapon\'s platform, the weapon\'s suite 
was reconfigured.  The number of missile launchers were reduced from 4 to 
2.  The complement of 2-triple laser turrets remains, and the energy 
weaponry was enhanced with the addition of two Particle Accelerators, 
configured as a single battery (option void where prohibited).

If there was a single glaring weakness of the Stillwell class, it was that 
the complement of 30 troopers (20 Infantry and 3 vehicle crews) was 
insufficient in most cases.  The VonDamme is capable of carrying 2-1/2 
times that (75) consisting of 60 troopers and 5 vehicle crews.  (Design 
vehicle is the TL12 Grav Tank, CSC p.81).  Combatant delivery is as 
follows: 3 squads (30 battlesuited Heavy Infantry) are released via drop 
capsule (2 drops are available before the supply of capsules must be 
replenished.)  One squad (generally the headquarters squad) rides as 
passengers in one of the modular cutters, configured for cargo.  The cutter 
can carry 12 passengers independent of the module being carried, so this 
will not affect it\'s capacity of 30 tons (combat supplies) The other cutter 
will be configured to carry the 5 Grav tanks (4 std) and the crews (15). 
 The final squad will be split between the two G-Carriers, to act as scouts 
and/or a mobile reserve.  Meanwhile, the VonDamme herself continues to act 
as an orbital artillery support ship.

Because of cargo limitations, the cutters will have to be pre-loaded at the 
base of operations.  However, 33 tons of cargo space is allotted on board 
for extended operations.

Battery capacity in the VonDamme was severely cut, but still enables the 
ship to operate for 17 hours with the Power Plants shut down (assuming no 
weapon use...)

An electronics shop and machine shop have been added to the ship, 
complementing the extensive sickbay and Ship\'s Locker that existed in the 
original design.  The 2 armories were enhanced to support the 60 combat 
troops anticipated by this design.

To assist in providing the combat force with accurate data, the VonDamme is 
equipped with a TL 12 neutrino detector and a TL 12 densitiometer.  This 
allows the ship to detect and map underground complexes, before combat 
personnel ever set foot in the area.  To provide protection for the ship 
while performing such low altitude maneuvers, the VonDamme is equipped with 
the latest Nuclear Damper and Meson Fields.

Finally, even with the significant weapon\'s upgrade, performance upgrade 
and increased, we  were able to drop the price to MCr 871.855  - which 
includes the 2 G-Carriers, 2 Modular Cutters, and 5 Grav Tanks.

I have no idea who the third party is, or if they ever will publish

I agree that we need BOTH a form to be filled out and to record the design

 Fully agreed.  Not knowing how ships fight, even roughly, makes it
 pointless to design them.  Is an armor rating of 100 enough to stp a PAW
 100 cold, stop it half the time, or once only?  How about a 99, or a 101,
 or a 120?  Do systems degrade, or do they die on the first hit?
 
 If we know the answers to these, then we can build ships in virtually any
 design system, as long as they evaluate to the same ship cards.  >>

More even than what you say. Plaers need an understanding of what the sensors
will do, and how (many don\'t know the difference between active and passive
sensors, etc).

AND, the design system needs to tell about design philosophies rather than
guide a player through a design process without preface or discussion.

Hey Marc,

The plan outlined below sounds good to me; however, I guess you could say
I\'m a gearhead.  On behalf of the gearheads, I would recommend that you
include the formula used to derive the tabular data where possible, putting
it/them in the text and at the bottom of the table or chart.

Your expectant gearhead,

	Does "exclusive" mean an out for free development of PBM games ?

	I mean, what would happen when I add trade to my sector viewer,

	I think I\'m on of them, but for a reason not yet mentioned here.

	Well I\'ve once played a Traveller setting over GURPS rules mix,
	refereed by a friend who know GURPS. It was in Diaspora in the
	Antebellum (to be precise 280-3I) and had a lot of political
	and counter intelligence enigmas. I\'ve enjoyed it.

	As Traveller had 4 distinct \'incompatible\' rulesets, a 5th is
	no problem as long as the setting is Traveller. But what\'s
	probately come in print next year is imho not Traveller, because
	its invalidating half of the Traveller canon. Its invalidating
	both MT and TNE history, just because "they had a dream".

Sure, this is just the GURPS Success System from B86.  What I\'m talking
about are *tasks* describable as Routine, Formidable, etc where the DM\'s
have standard meanings. Something like:

  Easy        +3
  Routine      0
  Hard        -3        [For instance]
  Formidable  -6        
  Staggering  -9
  Hopeless   -12

The GM is, of course, the final arbiter, but having difficulty descriptions
like this make defining tasks much easier.  These descriptors would be
cumulative, so performing a Hard Task (-3) in the dark (-5) would be of
almost Staggering difficulty (-8).

Now your example would go like this, "There\'s not a lot left of the
carvings.  This is a Formidable challenge to your Archaeology skill, roll
Archaeology-6 to interpret them."

Well Zane, I don\'t use frames on my site, although Geocities has pasted
a bit of Java on the front of my main page.  (Wish I could get rid of
it).

I do used animated GIFs, but everything has an ALT description so you
really don\'t even need to view GIFs.
In the future I\'m going to have to make ONE page have frames, as it will
be an ungodly lengthy list of weapons
and their stats, with the header \'froze\' so one can scrollbar thru the
entire list and not have to scroll
all the way back up to remember a heading.

In case you\'re wondering, it\'s a list of almost 1,000 different types of
weapons, from small handheld units to the General Motors Mark 31 Bolo
unit.

Only because it\'s relatively easy for dogs to get an overdose by eating
it. The toxic component is Theophylline, which, in large doses, gives you
irregular heart rhythms. Humans can easily overdose on this stuff, too,
it\'s just a lot harder for a human to eat enough chocolate to get that
much. It _is_ a problem with things like asthma inhalers containing
thophylline, and there has been consideration of banning thophylline
containing inhalers for children for exactly this reason.

Typically, when you hear of a dog getting poisoned by chocolate, it\'s
someones little terrier or something that ate the pound of chocolates on
the coffee table. Also dogs metabolize theophylline more slowly, and the
average, than humans do, making the problem worse.

My dogs (65 and 70 lbs each) would probably have no problem handling a
pound of chocolate. Vargr, at what, an average of 60 kg, would have even
less.

All by way of a long-winded explanation to the effect that a Vargr would
probably have no problems with, or aversions to chocolate.

Does this mean that rather than alcohol, perhaps the adult beverage of

Sigfuy Snow Effect Board
Craft Id: WIG platform, TL 7, 8.94 KCr
    Hull: 1/1, Disp=0.19, Config=4AF, Armor=1
          Unloaded=0.32, Loaded=0.33
   Power: 1/1, Turbofan generator=0.0007, Duration=24 h (1 Cr/day of 
                hydrocarbon fuel)
    Loco: 1/1, NOE=100, Cruise=300, Top=400, G rating=0.6
   Commo: -
 Sensors: -
 Control: Electronic (manual control possible)
   Accom: 1 cramped seat
   Other: VTOL.  Glide 7, Combat Move=14, Travel 1200, Agility 15,
          Maintenance=0.11

The Snow effect board is a very efficient device used to skim over
desert
glaciers on icy planets.  The board is a simple hexagon-shaped
carbon-fiber
\'wing\' with skids on the wingtips and a skid/rudder aft.  A very
small
turbofan jet engine at the \'nose\' pumps high-pressure air under the
wing
to keep it flying on its air cushion.  The pilot lays on his stomach 
and keep his eyes open, because that engine gives quite a kick.
Skilled
pilots don\'t need to use the electronic controls, instead balancing
their
weight on the board to control it.  To reduce the problem of take
off and landing roll, the board is capable of vertical take off and 
landing, at the cost of 25 times its normal fuel consumption, up to
its cruising height (about 1 meter off the ground).

Ideal for sports fans, deadly snow assasins and jolly red
philanthropists
on a budget.  However the board has no room for cargo but can
possibly
carry a surprising amount of extra weight at the loss of VTOL
capability
and increased risk of a crash.

Do you know how to make "fish sauce" an common ingredient/topping in may
oriental dishes?
You need a board, a bowl, a nail and a fish.  Place the bowl in a corner
where it will not be disturbed.  Place the fish on the board then nail it\'s
tail down.  Place the board in the bowl with the mouth of the fish pointing
down and lean the board up against the wall.  Come back when the fish is
just skin and bones and bottle the fish sauce.

Different strokes for different folks I always say.  Did you ever try to
find the food taboos of another culture?  For the most part, it\'s
impossible.  If you ask a typical member of any culture what their food
taboos are, they will assure you that they don\'t have any.

Ever eat pumpernickel bread?  It\'s German in origin, but according to one
tail the name is from the French.  It seems that one of Napoleon\'s generals
had this war-horse named Nicholas who loved the course brown bread, so in
order to ingratiate themselves with both the horse and the general, the
soldiers under his command would often bring him a slice of it.  They
referred to it among them selves as pum por Nicole (bread for Nicole (the
general\'s nickname for the horse)).

The German people hearing it called this thought it was an honorific
bestowed by the French troops.  In fact, the French hated the bread, it was
too coarse for their "refined" palettes.  Come to think of it I don\'t care
much for it either, not because it is coarse, but because I don\'t care for
rye.

You are experiencing a translation error, the correct spelling of the unit

I\'ve got one further thing to add to this portion, there is a new Hard Back
novel called "Battlestar Galactica: Armageddon", by Richard Hatch and
Christopher Golden, and published by Pocket Books.  It was published around
last June, but I only found out about it last month.  I just finished it
yesterday, and unfortunatly didn\'t think about it earlier.

It\'s a pretty good book, although it goes into a lot of stuff that I feel
should be left unsaid (read it to find out what).  It\'s definitly better
than the Comic book series that came out a year or so ago.  There is
supposed to be another novel sometime in \'98.

What this book really has to do with this discussion is that it\'s got a few
pages of glossary in the back of the book to help make sense of the units
of measurement, etc.  Also according to the book, the ships do have some
sort of hyperdrive, and this includes the Vipers (In all honesty this makes
sense, but as I said earlier in this thread, the show was never clear on
it).

Ah, this is actually the one argument against GURPS Traveller I\'ve no
objection to.  I understand your point, and I both agree and disagree with
it.

My way of looking at this is that you will be able to play the MT setting
with GURPS Traveller with no problem whatsoever.  TNE will require a little
work, but not much.  This is my argument for this argument.


Personally I got into Traveller when TNE came out.  The TNE rulebook was my
first Traveller book.  I now own a majority of all Traveller material, all
IG material, all GDW material except a couple Classic items, plus a good
percentage of the third party stuff.  I think Traveller is one of the best
two RPG settings, period.

Despite the fact that TNE was the first thing I got, and some of the MT
stuff was second, it\'s the Classic setting I love.  Quite honestly I\'ve
never been able to get into the TNE setting, except the Domain of Deneb
portian, this is because I really hate the concept of the Virus.  I like
the MT setting, but think they went to far.

Based on this, I personally love the concept of an alternate timeline.
Maybe this is because I\'ve always enjoyed the concept of alternate
timelines, the point is, it is an alternate timeline and it doesn\'t
invalidate MT or TNE.  Also remember one of the core concepts of RPG\'s is
that as the GM you can throw out whatever you want, be it rules or some
aspect of the "Holy Traveller Canon".

Well actually, in the  case of my players (and this is just my group, I
might add), they don\'t like CT, partially because of the character creation
system. They like T4, because I let them CHOOSE things even more than the
rules allow for. I realize that you can do this with CT too (a GM decides
how his game works), but a lot of people are passice when it comes  to that
sort of thing; they won\'t go against the rules even when they SHOULD. You,
of course, are a heretic, and therefore  not subject to this limitation :)

There is a random character creation method given in the GURPS Basic set
which would provide a system example for something like that. I don\'t think
there will be any "official" system like that. I really think that in the
case of the GURPS system, random character creation is a bad idea. It could
produce some very unbalancedc characters. But, it\'s your game :)

http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/~tlh10/lec15.htm

http://www.physics.gmu.edu/classinfo/astr103/CourseNotes/str_radt.htm


  If I might suggest, the first one has a very in depth set of notes well
worth reading.  In it, it even has information about the maximum population
that earth can be expected to hold (some 180 x 10^9 IIRC) based upon
caloric needs of people plus maximum available land use.  The notes also
reference the fact that today, there are something on the order of a 93
million population gained per year based on birth/death statistics.

  In any event, those who requested the formulas, please be patient while I
gather all of the formulas into one spot, and then email it directly to the
list... I am not exactly the most organized person in the world <grin>...

Blake\'s 7:  Coherent story arc, well defined characters, minimal
techno-babble, well done on a very low budget.

Dr. Who:  Great concept, wonderful actors, stories covering everything from
light comedy to the deaths of major characters (who didn\'t cry at the end
credits of the final episode of Earthshock, with Adric\'s broken pin..) Well
done on a miniscule budget.

Battlestar Galactica:  One dimensional characters, poor acting,
techno-babble through the roof (microns???) heavy reliance on stock footage
(we used to joke that the Cylons were experts at just grazing the top fin
of Vipers, since they made that shot at least three times an episode.),
disconnected stories that did very little to advance the "search for Earth"
storyline..

Very little comparison IMHO.

The only good to come out of BG in my opinion was the shoot of Dirk
Benedict reacting to a Cylon Warrior in the opening credits of "The A-Team."

According to my wife (who is a BG fan) the unit of time was a "centon."  As

It\'s an alternate setting.  I don\'t think the Game Police will kick down
your door if you use GURPS Traveller to run a Rebellion era game, nor will
they drag you away for using T4.1 in the alternate setting.

In the campaign I\'m writing up, the Fifth Frontier War is going to have a
very different ending.. Am I still playing Traveller?

Nope, a micron was a measure of distance. A centon (sp?) was the measure of
time. I can remember thinking that the Galactica needed longer range radar
(or whatever they used) because in one episode they did not notice a Cylon
attack force until it was only 50 microns away.

My draft of Marc\'s chargen for 4.1 is probably outdated it\'s so old, but it
was pretty easy to follow.  The problem with translating that to
equipment/vehicle design is length.  I\'m afraid the checklist might be so
long, several pages, as to seperate it from charts/tables/formulas too
much.  It\'s probably just a difference in people, but I\'d prefer to keep
the *bare* instructions in sight of the tables/etc they refer to at all
times.  Facing pages or a two column approach might be a good compromise.

Well, I *hate* formulas buried in the middle of text. ;->  It\'s the buried,
I hate, so if you put them in there how about italizing them, bolding them,
making them a large font size so they *really* stand out?

I\'d just like to mention that you should strictly limit the amount of
chocolate given to very small children as well.

Hum, well I disagree a little with Bruce here.  I think Vargr would have
the same sorts of problems with chocolate that humans have with alcohol.
They are a *little* less massive than your average human and thophylline
should have a slightly stronger and longer lasting effect on them than
humans.  Even if it doesn\'t, that\'s the way I\'d run things in a game. BTW,
Vargr would also get drunk on alcohol just as easily as humans too. I\'d
guess chocolate liqueurs would be *big* sellers among Vargr.  ;->

As someone old enough to have gone through school at the time Australia was
converting from Lsd to Decimal currency and from Imperial Weights and Measures
to Metrics I can assure you that metrics are *not* any more "intuitive" than
Imperial measures. I think we could say that any system one is brought up with
is *intuitive*, but I still find it easier and more meaningful to convert to
Imperial measures when I need to know the magnitude of something.

And, as an interesting case in point, as a High School teacher I have noted that
my students rarely (in fact, I\'d be more daring, and say *never*) know their
height in Meters, but *always* refer to it in Feet and Inches. They tend to
refer to their weight in Stones and Pounds more than they do in Kilos, though
less decisively (around 80% rather than 100%).

No apology needed, Zane, but I do appreciate you\'re offering it.  I\'m not

Pretty much.  I have rules, although they are usually my own, and the first
is to try to make sure everybody playing has a good time.

Sure is, but building a character up during his career (ie Traveller) is
pertty decent for this too, especially if the players are using the process
to develop a backstory for their character as they go.

That\'s a suppliment I don\'t have.  I saw it in a store a couple of years

I don\'t have Martial Arts either, but I\'ve always thought it would be a
good suppliment to have.  Vehicles 2nd, I special ordered directly from
SJG, and I\'m glad I did because they sold out a few weeks later.  I saw
where they will do a reprint in a couple of months.

I never bought the Atlases, Bestiary, or Aliens.  I either use Trav sectors
or build my own, so the Atlases didn\'t appeal.  Aliens might be worth a
look though, if it has a good design system.

This is true. We inherited reactor sizes from FFS1, and they\'re quite
big. Possibly we should introduce low-efficiency/low-size reactors
like Topaz...though it\'s a niche technology for anything above TL9.

Isotope RTG\'s like Galileo (or Cassini) are pretty much a niche 
technology by traveller standards - there are very few cases at high
TL\'s in which they\'re useful. (There aren\'t even a whole lot of 
cases at low TLs...) They\'re hard to model, too, since power
requirements in Traveller are (historically) very high. On the whole
I didn\'t think they were a big omission. If you want to include them,
someone should look up how much Cassini\'s RTG weighed (including
shielding...)

A checklist is not a detailed formula which covers every possible contingency.
It is a series of steps which must be followed in order to achieve the final
design goal. If (the current) FF&S is viewed as a first draft, then it is
possible to create a set of tables/charts which reflect some specific type of
vehicle being created, and to create checklists for modular goals...

A checklist for a powerplant.
A checklist for a chassis with locomotion.
A checklist for sensor packages.

Each of these could be produces as a set of charts and a checklist with (I
think) reasonable results). The ultimate goal for a the chart/checklist
process is to make the final design process as user friendly as possible.

Alcohol would probably do just fine for the Aslan.  Perhaps cat-nip tea

As for K\'kree, have you ever seen a stoned cow?  I have, here in the
heartland, dairy and beef farmers are constantly on the look-out for them. 
If you have one stoned cow, look out, because soon you may have more.  They
get stoned on a local weed called Locoweed (spelling varies by locality). 
Perhaps the K\'kree would enjoy something like that.

I could not agree more!  Perhaps I should have said with the text rather
than in the text.  The formula could also be placed as foot notes to the
text, to keep it out of the hair of the non-gear-heads.  But if it is in
the text do make it stand out.

Piracy in Traveller is not on the scale of Ned Kelly and friends, who with
equipment that is lying around most frontier households (viz, couple of
guns and some fast horses, and ,later, some scrap iron) could go into the
bandit business.

Piracy in Traveller is a criminal/commercial enterprise with a fixed
capital costs in the tens of megacredits, minimum.

Striker mark one book two states it takes a maximum of six turns (i.e.
three minutes). Call it 15 minutes for starships, plus five to get the crew

The pirate also has the problem of matching vectors with the (presumably)
one gee merchant ship, that itself is heading outwards. 

A 20 gee missile will also be faster in making the rendezvous. Command
control missiles can presumably be ordered not to fire if it all turns out
to be a tragic mistake.

You dont do random "sweep" patrols, you put the escorts with the outgoing
ships in a convoy. Random sweeps are appallingly inefficient.

And, once again, reasonably cheap passive sensors put the detection range
of oribital sensors well and truly at the 100 diameters limit.

Unless your target adopts course changes. Convoys in WW2 did this
reasonably frequently.

Being on a ballistic course is also very very embarressing if you *do* get
tagged as a Bad Guy, as then you cant evade incoming fire.

Firstly, the freighter has it\'s chance to make a jump at 90 diameters. If
it does so, the pirate comes up empty, and has alerted the Planetary
Defense Forces for no good result.

Me, I would take my chances with a misjump, rather than trust a pirate who
will say "I\'ll let the witnesses to this theft of MCr 60 live".

Also I cannot recall where a jammer exists in Traveller that can prevent
detection via passive sensors. Jammers exist that can block tageting
solutions, yes, but not detection.

There is also the potential problem that a ship with such a jammer would
immediatly fail an inspection if passing as an "innocent merchant".
Therefore it will be a ship whose only role is war.

Jammers are also damn expensive.

Firstly, with the Third Imperium we are talking a society that said "OK" to
the nuking of suspected pirate bases.

Secondly, lifeboats from torpedoed ships were routinely abandoned in WW2
while the escorts went chasing u-boats (check for example the fate of the
survivors of the Henry Luckenback in HX229 on the morning of 17 March 1943.
Three lifeboats got away, but were not picked up by any of the four escorts
that came across them, as they were either overloaded or busy. Ref Keegan,
The Price of Admirality, p 304).

Thirdly, at what ranges are we talking this happening ? If it is within
weapons range (a conservative 300 000 km) of the escort ship, the pirate is
running a truly awful risk, as it will be powered down and not evading.

   [From the Imperial Ministry of Trade and Development, press release
   0026-281-0001, Capital/Core] 
   
   The Imperial Ministry of Trade and Development (IMTD) is pleased to
   announce the latest phase in its ongoing Trade Recovery and Extension
   (TRE) program. The TRE is a set of initiatives aimed at fostering
   greater trade within the Imperium and its friendly neighboring states.
   The goal of the program is to foster economic development on promising
   worlds which, due to vagaries of astrography or other factors, have
   not thus far fully participated in the economic renaissance
   accompanying the establishment of the Third Imperium. The new TRE
   phase now launched has been designated the "Vland-Coreward Trade
   Initiative" (VCTI).
   
  The vessel
  
   As one facet of the VCTI, bids are being solicited for a small
   cargo/passenger vessel to serve worlds in a loop described below. IMTD
   considers improved trade and transport coverage of this route so
   important that it will provide purchase and operating subsidies to
   these craft (see financial prospectus). However, contractors
   submitting bids for this vessel are warned that only limited subsidies
   are available, so the vessel should be designed to be as intrinsically
   profitable as is feasible given the route to be covered.
   
   It is expected -- and will be encouraged -- that these vessels will
   engage in "speculative" cargo transport. One difficulty currently
   being faced on the route in question is that rapidly changing needs
   for equipment, materials, and personnel are not being well served by
   larger bulk shipping operations. The IMTD feels that smaller, more
   flexible vessels can fill this gap and have a disproportionate
   positive impact on economic development in the region.
   
   The vessel must meet the following minimum requirements:

     * Jump-2
     * Capable of planetary landings
     * 200 dt cargo volume
     * 20 mid-passengers
       
   In addition, the vessel should be reasonably capable of defending
   itself in the event of combat. The Imperial Navy is actively
   investigating reports of piracy sponsored by states coreward of Vland,
   and should have the matter under control in the near future -- but it
   is best to take precautions.
   
   Also, concern for absolute theoretical profit maximization should be
   balanced with awareness of the ship\'s planned operational environment.
   Flexibility is a key asset in this vessel, as is reliability and (to a
   degree) self-reliance.
   
  The route
  
   The IMTD wishes to thank Sir Douglas Berry, K.S.C., for his invaluable
   assistance in developing the VCTI route and accompanying analysis. 
   
   All worlds are in the Vland sector:

   1919 Khula         B-475AAA-C  HiPop, Ind
   2017 Tahwer        C-769A88-8  HiPop
   2016 Guuiish       C-736344-6  NonInd, LoPop  2 GG
   1817 Tauri         A-130899-0  NonAg, Poor
   1717 Vland         B-967A44-B  Hi, Capital
   1719 Uushiish Uun  E-586466-5  Owned:1717     3 GG
   1919 (loop)

   Note that the data for Vland has been corrected from the erroneous
   version printed in most previous survey data. The ISS continues to
   investigate this probable act of data sabotage. 
   
   Tauri is the key to this loop. During the Long Night, this world lost
   its technology with particular thoroughness, but retained a stable,
   successful society despite the rigors of a barely-habitable ecosphere.
   During the early pre-Imperial period, vast lanthanum orebeds were
   discovered in Tauri\'s uninhabited highlands. Rather than permit
   unchecked offworld exploitation of these ores, the Imperial government
   has allowed only limited access to offworld interests, holding the
   ores in trust to Tauri\'s population. The ISS is coordinating a
   technology uplift effort aimed at restoring industrial technology to
   Tauri without disrupting the world\'s culture. Carrying specialized
   equipment, trade goods, and personnel to and from Tauri will be a
   critical aspect of the VCTI. To facilitate this, a class A starport
   has recently been opened on Tauri.
   
   Uushiish Uun is on the brink of becoming an important agricultural
   world. Providing a vigorous export market for specialty and gourmet
   agricultural products (to be sold at Khula or Tahwer) will help boost
   the world\'s economic development, and encourage further colonization
   of this underpopulated world.
   
   From Khula, the vessel would take high-tech goods to Tahwer, and high
   and medium tech to Guuiish. Raw and processed organics would probaly
   be welcome on Tauri, which would provide raw materials,
   locally-produced art, and the like for transport to Vland. Vland is
   another producer of finished goods, which support the growing colony
   on Uushiish Uun.
   
   The route works almost as well, but not as profitably, in the other
   direction. After the huge margin of profit selling from Vland to
   Tauri, a merchant would face three jumps worth of rising tech levels,
   and the planet best suited to make use of Tauri\'s resources lies at
   the end of the route. The IMTD projects that not more than one in five
   runs will go clockwise around the circut.

As someone who is living in a land (the US of A) that is supposed to be
going metric, I understand the prospect first hand (not money, but I can
imagine).

An example of what I meant was do you know how many cubic yards (or feet or
inches) of water weigh a ton?  I know that in exactitude, a cubic meter of
water does not always weigh exactly a tonne, but it is pretty close (within
a fraction of a gram).  Densities are nearly always given with a standard
of pure water at a standard temperature being 1 or g/cc.  I always have to
convert from one to the other then back for anything like that.  I could
list other things as easily, but you get the idea.

And, no I have no idea what I weigh in kg (or stones) and don\'t care.  When
we actually finally and truly adopt the metric system and I am no longer
asked for my weight on official forms in lbs or my height in feet and
inches (or just inches), then, I will probably know it.

BTW, what does a stone equal?  Are those US pounds or Imperial?  Does a
pound of silver weigh the same as a pound of iron?  Don\'t know the answers
right off the top of your head to the last two?  Don\'t feel bad the only of
those questions I could have answered off the without a reference book was
the one about silver and iron.  (The answer is no for those of you who
don\'t know.  A pound of iron weighs 7000 grains and a pound of silver
weighs less.)

When I was in grade school (lower forms(?)/elementary school) we had never
even heard of a metric system.  I am still learning it, but as I said for
many parts, it IS more intuitive.  Especially for ship design, whether 1 Td
=3D 3 cubic meters or 14 cubic meters.

  Okay, I took my own advice, with the following results: 

First, I discovered that you *can\'t* design a laser rifle with 12d damage.
Output energy of 999kJ gives 8d; 1000kJ gives 16d - go with the higher
number. 

A TL 8 Backpack Laser Rifle has 4 different power settings, with separate
performance statistics.
Constants are:  Empty weight 9 lb; Acc 15, SS 12, Rcl 0, Cost $5600. 

Dam     1/2D     Max     RoF     Shots 

16d+2   1600yd   3200yd  1       50 
7d-1    1300yd   2600yd  3~      75 
6d      1200yd   2400yd  4       100 
4d      800yd    1600yd  8       200 

The powerpack is 2xD-size power *slugs*, although somewhat more efficient
than the basic version (TL9 rather than TL8):  Weight 85lb (including
cable and connectors), Cost $500. 

Weight and performance correspond well to TNE statistics (9.3lb for the
rifle; 98lb for the pack). 

Conclusion:  GURPS Traveller should use power slugs, at least for energy
weapons, per UT2.

You compute the volume of the reactor and the fuel separately.  Because of
the way fission reactors work, the containment vessel of the reactor as
installed would include both the reactor core itself and the fuel.

It\'s done this way because the size of the reactor core will vary depending
on the amount of fuel that the reactor is designed to hold.  Assuming that
the power output will remain the same, the larger quantity of fuel would
allow you to run the reactor for longer between refueling.

>2.    The minimum size of a fission reactor seems to be inconsistent with

>conversion using thermionic diodes.

Two reasons, one specific and one general.  In specific, I didn\'t have any
data on the Topaz reactor, and so couldn\'t attempt to model it.  Secondly,
all of the various power plants tend to produce unrealistic results at the
extrememes of the range.  If you use the Internal Combusion plants rules
to try and reproduce a 2 horsepower Briggs and Stratton or a 0.020 cubic 
inch Cox model-airplane engine, it doesn\'t come out very well, either.

>3.    What are the radiator requirements for chemical power plants?

Chemical power plants are assumed to be operated in an atmospheric
environment that allows adequate cooling without specific surface area
requirements.  The power plant as computed includes the required ductwork,
radiators, and so forth.

>4.    Photoelectric systems don\'t make any sense.  The Area column appears
>to represent the radiator requirement

The area column is the area requirement for the collectors.  The additional
volume includes any needed power convertors power regulation equipment 
(generally located elsewhere), in additon to the collection arrays themselves.

>5.    It doesn\'t seem possible to reproduce the thermo electric batteries

That\'s correct.  radio-isotope reactors - including the SNAP series, as well 
as the power sources for recent deep-space probes, aren\'t included in FF&S2.
I have some good data on the SNAP series of reactors, but not on newer
items.  I suspect that (due to the type of conversion technology used) that
the Russian Topaz reactor would be more correctly handled by rules like this.

It\'s something that would be nice to include, but I don\'t know if there
will be a follow-on volume to FF&S2 from IG, let alone what will be included.

Each method has it\'s advantages, with GURPS I feel that you\'ve got a better
idea what the character is capable of, well maybe not, but it\'s great for
discribing those special little abilities :^)

Traveller on the other had is great for building up a background, something
which point based systems such as GURPS quite admitadly are not.

Amazingly that was exactly what happened to me, thankfully I was lucky
enough to find it used in a local Bookstore.  One of the few GURPS books
I\'ve found used that I want.

Already on order with my FLGS, another case of foolishly deciding to wait
till next payday.  Now I\'m smart, if I don\'t have the money, I have them
set it aside for me :^)

I like the Atlases more for the planetary descriptions.  If I was to use a
map from another game, I\'d probably use the one from Space Master.  As for
the Bestiary and Aliens, I don\'t think I\'ve actually used either, and have
barely looked at them.  Sort of like all the Star Wars RPG books I bought
at a convention (got ~$1000.00 worth of books for less than $100, couldn\'t
pass that up, if you get a chance to go to a convention that WEG is at, go).

At least they FINALLY reprinted Illuminati!  I swear most with most books
if you don\'t get them as soon as they come out, they\'re OOP!  You mentioned
the Compendium\'s and the Ultra Tech books in your first post, I\'m not sure,
but I suspect you\'d have a hard time finding a copy of any of them.  At
least I don\'t think they\'re available around here.

Let this be a warning to everyone, if you want GURPS Traveller, it might be
a good idea to get it the minute it comes out!

   Probably the best of the British sci-fi shows actually, given the

   We disagree here.  Enemies (particularly arch villians) were
cardboard cutouts.  Originial Star Trek series done on probably about
the same amount of money and had much better special effects, and more
believable gadgets.  The protrayal of Dr. Who depended largely on the
person playing the part (they were definately not equal).

>storyline..

   Character development was occuring, granted at a slow pace, not
unusual for American TV series (compare M*A*S*H first season with
M*A*S*H fifth season).  Still, I found the main characters very
likeable, and the performances convincing (though I will admit that in
watching BG epsiodes about a year ago I concluded that Ms. Lockhart
(Sheba) couldn\'t act her way out of a wet paper sack).  Techno-babble
comes with American sci-fi in the post Star Wars era (even Bab 5 has its
share).  I would have liked to have seen more coherant technobabble, but
then I believe it was Star Wars that gave the line about doing the
Kessel Run using parsecs as a measure of time.  Stock footage became
necessary as a method of cost cutting (Buck Rodgers, the NBC TV series
was far worse in this department IMHO)--remember cheap special effects a
la Bab 5 that allow for massive epic space warfare doesn\'t exist yet.

   Ahead of its time.  Should never have been an American broadcast
network (ABC, NBC, CBS, etc.) TV series.  Broadcast TV networks take
good sci-fi premises and kill them.  Had it been a syndicated show that
premiered after Star Trek: The Next Generation blazed the trail, it
would have had similar success to Bab 5.  In its day (late 70s), could
have made a run of it as an occasional summer mini-series (5 new
espisodes a year) or as a series of movies in theatrical release (the
pilot with some additional footage from the first episode did well
enough in theatres to justify the making of "Galactica: 1980", a *truly*
bad TV series that most true BG fans don\'t like to talk about).

   As far as advancing the "search for Earth" storyline goes, you can
only find so many bits of evidence steering them toward Earth before
they have to find it or lose all credibility (Gillian\'s Island Syndrome:
*everyone* seems to have visited the island, but nobody bothers to tell
the authorities the Castaways are there).  Assuming you are on at least
a five year plan, naturally the evidence is going to be stretched out
over time.

>Very little comparison IMHO.

   The closest thing to Blakes 7 I can think of on American TV would be
the Twilight Zone (if B7 were turned into series of TZ episodes). 
Definately no comparison between B7 and BG, as they were doing different
types of sci-fi.

>The only good to come out of BG in my opinion was the shoot of Dirk
>Benedict reacting to a Cylon Warrior in the opening credits of "The A-Team."

   Dirk Benedict was essentially playing Starbuck, the likeable
scoundrel on "The A-Team".  The only major difference was that "Faceman"
didn\'t have a blonde girlfriend or a low recoil plasma pistol (though
the chrome plated assault rifles were nice).

Deity only knows, nevertheless my suggestions follow.

Well I think that the GURPS system already provides very clear
definitions of Critical Success, Success, Failure, and Critical Failure.
What it needs for greater usefullness is an explicit, codified system,
more accurately describing the modifiers to skill roll required based on
the difficulty of the task.  I would suggest shamelessly stealing from
the MT task system.  I think that in Gurps terms each additional DiffMod
should be about a -3 or 4 to skill level.  A Difficult task would be
rolled against unmodified skill.  A Formidable task would be rolled at
- -3 or 4 (we should pick 1 or the other, a Staggering Task (which I have
added to MT) at -6 or -8, and an Impossible Task at -9 or -12.
We could than add the concept of Marginal Success and define it as any
skill roll that _just_ succeedes. The 3d6 ( - postive task DM\'s ) used
for task time determination could also be brought into GURPS maybe as
3d6 - (Skill/4 (round down)) = modifier.

If you do not like balance have the players generate the charecters on
50 + 3d6 x 5 points or so, or even on d6 x d6 x d6 x d6 points if you
really want diverse point totals. [This would yield an modal point total
of 150 points and a range of between 1 point and 1,296 points - this
should give enough diversity for most charecters.

Note that if you are converting an established MT charecter with
powerfull Psionic powers 1,296 points may be nowhere near enough.  In
GURPS psionic powers cost more points for range then they do in
Traveller, especially MT.

"character to characters" - This sounds as if it is a minimum
requirement.  I am reminded of the comment that the average role playing
charecter is lucky to have 2 dimensions, much less 3.

I have the exact opposite problem. When someone asks me for my height and weight
I give the former in Feet and inches (and I think I could get by with that on
official forms, I know hospitals still record feet and inches from personal and
recent experience ... or, actually, record both) and the latter in kilos or
stones/pounds depending on my mood ;-)

A Stone = 14 pounds. As far as I know US lbs and Imperial lbs were the same.

You\'re joking? And which falls to the earth faster? a *pound* of iron weighs one
pound, as does a *pound* of feathers. That\'s about as old as methuselah!

Now, if you\'re specifying Pounds Avoirdupois (12 ozs rather than 16 ozs to the
pound), then thats diffent.

12ozs as opposed to 16ozs.

We used Metrics for Science and, sometimes, for Maths. More often we used
Imperial measures for maths. Still, *I* find Miles easier to relate to than
Kilometers, pounds easier to relate to than kilos and pints easier than liters.

And, anyway, just because you Yanks had the bad manners to leave the Empire and
had to prove it by doing *everything* differently doesn\'t mean *we* have to
worry about US measures rather than Imperial!

(Which is one of the reasons why I wrote an article on it for "Dark Star #2")

OK here is the scenario of why and how Emperor Cleon was stepping out of
Emperor Strephons shower a thousand years or so after he was supposed to
be dead.  Please do not tell this secret to any actual inhabitants of
the Third Imperium.

Gather around and listen as I tell a story of long ago and far away.

Faek zaeknue, or once upon a time, long ago, there lived in a grand
plance a prince among Humans, the Roukh Cleon.  Cleon was a hero among
men, strong and brave and well respected by all.  The time had come for
the Vaegarrgh, the Long Night among the Humans, to end and Cleon who had
been born to a high place and achieved a higher one through his glory
was the man to end it.  The story of this Empire is the story for
another night.  This is the story of Cleons return.

It came to pass that half a century, as the humans reckon time, had
passed since the creation of the Third Imperium.  Tadafa had come to
him, or as the humans would say it age was nipping at the great and well
respected Cleon as no enemy ever had.  One night Cleon lay sleeping and
a mysterious being appeared.  The great Cleon was alone in his errta,
his suite, with his thoughts while his Ngoerrghsarrgh, his Emperors
Guard, kept him safe by watching from a distance.

An ilksang aegzva, or strange being, being appeared out of thin air
before Cleon.  Cleon called for his guard but no answer came.  It was as
if time itself had stopped.  The being turned to look at Cleon, who even
ravaged by age was still a ghoerrg, a hero, and he was sore afraid.  The
being said unto him "Be you not afraid."  And Cleon was not afraid.  The
being said unto Cleon "Your time here is done.  Will you come with me ?" 

Cleon said "Is it time for me to goersghengig, to die ?"  The mysterious
stranger replied " No, it is time for you to goersghekfe, to begin anew.
I, and your Empire, have need of you elsewhere, there is a uerzdezlurz,
a great force for you to vanquish, there." Cleon said "If I am needed
elsewhere, I will llurghngoez, or leave my people.

The Ilksangargh held forth its knaerssourz, its four fingered paw. 
Cleon reached forth and took the paw.  Cleons adventure began.

Back in the Emperor Cleons quarters the guards watching him saw his
lifsigns fading.  They called quickly for the Doctors.  The wise men
labored to bring back the spark of life to Cleons body but it was to
late.  

Cleons oerrgh, his life, was over, or so his people belived.  The word
went forth that Cleon had died and there was much lamentation.

Elsewhere Cleon fealt strange things happening to his body.  In the
course of a azsaesu, a watch, his body lost two thirds of its age and
Cleon was a man in his prime.

The mysterius stranger appeared before Cleon and spoke.  "Cleon your
Empire now had a weak man on its throne, he allows his runag, his
advisors too much influence.  He is a good man but he does not have your
ghaguen, your ability."

Cleon stepped forward and suddenly a room appeared around him. He found
himself in a tsukho, a palace.  Many saargh, reacted rapidly drawing
weapons and preparing to  khuengngig, to be murderous toward, this
intruder.  Cleon heard some of them mutter, ina strangely accented
Galanglic, something about "Zho Commando in the Octagon !" A man of
middle years, wearing the Irridium Circlet Cleon had left beside his
bed, waved for the guards to not fire.

The man on the throne, Cleons throne, said to him "Who are you ?"  Cleon
replied "I am The Emperor Cleon I, Grand Duke of Sylea, Etc.  Who are
you, and what are you doing with my crown ?"  The man replied "I am the
Emperor Strephon I, Archduke of Sylea, Duke of of Core, Marquis Usdiki,
Etc.  This is fagnaithllouellarrgh, or _my_ Interstellar Empire.  It is
the 131st day of the year 1116 and the man you are pretending to be has
been dead for almost 1000 years."

Cleon sensed an air of weakness from this "Strephon" almost as if he
were not who he claimed he was.  Cleon said "I am not dead.  I am here. 
Therefore according to the terms of the Hvaekgnaithlloellarrgh, The
Warrant of Restoration, Article II, paragraph 4 _I_ am the Emperor."

The man Strephon than had his guard seize Cleon.  Cleon was taken unto a
medical laboratory with strange devices he did not recognize.  The
Doctors there exaimined him.  After a short time they said that the DNA
scan proved that he was indeed Cleon.  They than began a long and
strange test Cleon did not understand muttering something about "testing
for clonal pattern fade".  Islae, soon they brought Cleon back to see
this Strephon, this time in a private audienc chamber. The man Strephon
said unto Cleon  "You seem to be whom you claim to be.  I will refer
this matter to the Aeroukhrunag, the Moot."  Strephon than spoke to a
young woman, who was dressed as a high noble and looked strikingly
similar to Strephon, his heir perhaps, sitting next to him and said
"Iphegenia please have all my  meetings for the next 48 hours
cancelled.  Please deliver my personal apologies to Terlyaruiwo
Ambassador."  The young woman turned her eyes upon Strephon with surpise
and anger flashing in them.  Once again Cleon sensed that not all was as
it seemed with this man Strephon.

And so concludes my story. 

"You all know the rest of the story, of how this Moot could not agree on
who was to be Emperor, or how other claimants to the Throne appeared, of
how the Third Imperium collapsed, of how the people, the Vargr, now
ksaenarsku ke gang human ngekdues, take protection money from and raid
human merchants. You know the glory of fuenrag, of taking for better
use, their goods.  You know that this is a gloroius time. "

Actually, chocolate is toxic to *humans* as well.

It\'s just that the quantities needed to make it kill you are far beyond 
what humans normally eat.

I\'m not sure if canine toxicity is due to something inherently different 
in their metabolism; or if it is just because they are generally smaller 
in mass, and able to wolf (pun intended) down large amounts of chocolate 
in a very short period of time.

In a Star Wars novel whose name I forget, the Kessel system and planet 
could only be reached by threading a tortuous path among several
highly dangerous, closely spaced stellar phenomena.  One could reduce
transit time by navigating closer to the dangerous bodies, thus
reducing the twistiness of one\'s path, but this made the task much
more dangerous.

I extrapolated from this basically what Richard Flores is thinking.
The better your navigation is, the shorter would be your total
distance travelled in visiting and leaving the planet. On the other
hand, piloting and the fineness of your ship\'s tune would limit just
how close a shave you can survive.

The Lord Sommerset class subsidized liner is very common in the Spinward
Marches, servicing many worlds that are unable to support regular service 
by the Mega Corporations. The long jump ability allows it to serve worlds
that are off the beaten track and could not be served by the many Free
Traders and Far Traders that operate in the region. 

Many versions have been built over the years to accommodate the various 
needs of the builders. Some have a minimum number of staterooms to allow
handling more cargo while others have fewer cargo holds to allow carrying 
of additional passengers. There are several that have been built with 
casinos on board and others have even been outfited as privateers.

The Lord Sommerset provides ample cabins for passenger service as well as
low berths for the commoners. Passengers can enjoy passing their travel
time in the passenger\'s lounge with it\'s dance floor, game tables, holo
viewing area and dining area, which is supplemented by a full kitchen. 
They can even keep in shape in the fully equipped gym. The lounge has a 
transparent dome allowing passengers to enjoy the views of space while 
they are relaxing. The dome can become opaque at the flip of a switch for 
those times when the view would not be enjoyable.

The cargo area is divided into six twenty ton bays, each with a large
hatch and a 4 ton automated cargo handler to make loading and unloading
fast and efficient.

The primary maneuver drive uses the latest in Thruster Plate technology.
However, when more power is needed on high G worlds the backup Conta-Grav
Lifters can be used at the same time. In atmosphere she is capable of
travelling at speeds of over 2,800kph. 

For worlds where there are limited starport facilities, the Lord Sommerset
is equipped with fuel scoops and a fuel purification plant that can convert 
a full load of fuel in 24 hours. She is streamlined to allow skimming of
gas giants, as well.

The Lord Sommerset carries a 20 ton ship\'s boat for emergency shuttle 
services and to land on worlds with too great a gravity well for her to 
land.

I\'ve been thinking more about it. Joining CotI gets you 1 Citizen Point. 
Subscribing to JTAS gets you another. Winning competitions gets you more, as does 
running con games. You can also buy them for, say, $15 each, or you can be paid 
by IG in CP instead of cash (say 1CP/$10) for writing stuff for them (includes 
stuff published in JTAS). When you reach 10CP, you can cash them in for a 
Knighthood, or carry on collecting them (20CP=Baron etc). You may also be able to 
cash them in for free Traveller books.

What\'s in it for us? The chance to officially become a part of the Traveller 
universe.

More importantly, what\'s in it for IG? Answer = *MONEY!* We give them money and 
receive \'nothing\' in return, and they get the chance to pay their writers 
\'nothing\'. The fact that this \'nothing\' is actually worth quite a bit to us 
doesn\'t matter to their accountants.

To date, I have recieved three emails asking Gridlore Technologies about
purchasing real-world gun parts.  I take great glee in responding that I\'d
be happy to, but there will be a slight delay in shipping since the company
won\'t be founded for another 5000 years and is wholly fictional at this point.

Reminds me of a demonstration I once saw.  I guy had about five metal
ingots lined up in a row, all about the same size.  You picked them up,
left to right.  Each one got heavier, until you got to the final ingot, it
was the lightest, and most people at that point seriously over compensated.

I\'ve always thought it meant that he took a short cut, in fact IIRC one of
the Star Wars novels released in the last few years explains this.
Something about him going through a region of space that was considered
unpassable.

> This is a ship I can easily imagine the Imperium building.

	imho the ship is no so bad at all, even if its not a battleship
	but a cruiser compared it with a CA 12 in MT-Fighting Ships. And
	unlike the late 3I battleships it was never intended to see a
	ship willing to fight. I would asume that the largest ship a
	Coronation saw was the "Aek Naz" - Vargr Cruiser 30000dt

	This ship has only 1G/Jump2, with 50E armor.

	Main stats :

	 1 Particle Accellerator 13-13-13-11
	 2 Plasma Gun Bays        4-3-2-1
	25 Beam Laser Barbetts    4-2-0-0
	25 Missile Barbetts
	66 Sand Caster Turrets
	 5 Repulsor Bays

	And those ships, together with the lighter Foghogs, not only stoped
	the imperial expansion in 185, they carried the war deep into imperial
	sectors and forced the peace of 191.

	Because of this war, ships of 100.000dt later only classify as
	Armored Cruiser. A new design was build for the "line of battle"
	- the 300.000dt BB12 substandart for colonial forces without a
	  meson screen
	- the 700.000dt BI13 for the imperial forces of course with a
	  meson screen

> nuke-det missiles.

	340.000km is the EFFECTIVE range ! the maximum range is therefore
	2720.000km 9 light seconds.

> In time of war, it will be a safe posting, for no sane admiral will ever
> risk one in line of battle.

	Well the imperial lost 2 depots. One in Antares, one in Ley, its
	not known how many Coronation a depot had for defense.

Let me put it this way: _GURPS Lensman_ was the supplement that turned me
into a GURPS customer for SJ Games.  I saw it when it was new (it caught my
eye, even though I wasn\'t looking at the GURPS rack, because it has a Frank
Kelly Freas* cover), and bought it and the GURPS basic rules on the spot. 
I\'ve since gone back for some of the other supplements.

And most of them are never reprinted, so if you\'re even vaguely interested,
you need to buy it as soon as it comes out.  "Beanie Babies" marketing for
RPGs, I guess.

> Let this be a warning to everyone, if you want GURPS Traveller, it might be
> a good idea to get it the minute it comes out!

Or pre-order the puppy.


* I have yet to be dissapointed by buying things on the basis of Freas
  artwork.  I guess it\'s an indicator of good taste on the part of the
  editor and publisher.

Yeah, I tend to do that. I try to use metric for everything, but annoyingly feet 
and inches seem to fit Real Life better!

I suppose it\'s appropriate to use Imperial units for Traveller...

6.67 m3 of TL12 batteries, to power the damper for one hour, will mass
13.34 tons and cost KCr 33.4

It will need a standard workstation - 7.5 m3, 0.2t and KCr 1.5.

The whole unit will therefore take up 65.17 m3, mass 64.54t, take up 5m2
and cost MCr 1.335.

This is fairly close to 5 displacement tons, 65 tons, 5m2 of surface area
and MCr 1.4.

Remember, after the first hour of the combat, you will need to allocate
10MW of power from the power plant to run the damper.

My intemperate comments about the Coronation class (very impressive. Just
dont ask me to fly in one in a war) led me to think about TL12 Meson
Screens fit for battleships.

Well, Ditzie and the ahhhh sophonts (and we are using this term *loosely*)
at FS started working on it (well, see, there is this arms race going on
between High Energy Soluuuutions and Legals ... we keep getting bigger
Meson Guns, and they keep getting bigger and better Meson Screens).

This is the result. They are designed for ships in the 10-99 kiloton range.

PV 500 Meson Screen : 16350 m3, 12010 t, 8000 m2 area, MCr 1601, Crew 50,
800 MW

This is designed to stop a 10 000 MJ meson gun (or a 100 gigajoule meson
gun at 3 and a bit times it\'s effective range).

The surface area required is roughly 1/3 of the surface area on a 25 000
displacement ton spherical battlecruiser. OTOH it only requires about 5% of
the total volume.

This is strongly implying that a 25 000 dt battlewagon is going to run out
of surface area real fast, but have lots of space left over.

To me, this implies a HePLAR propelled battlewagon could be the way to go
as HEPLAR is signifigantly cheaper, but requires lots of low-mass space for
the reaction mass.

Incidentally, a 64 m long, 8 m diameter particle accelerator is going to
have a maximum discharge energy of 4096 megajoules - enough for a damage
value of 320, implying an ability to crunch through 16 centimeters of
superdense. It will also have an effective range of 2.4 million kilometers
or so.

This is implying a paper-scissors-rock situations with battlewagons - the
speedy PAW armed ones will be able to keep away from the slow heavily armed
rocks, but not hurt them. The slow rocks will be unable to close, and bring
the speedy PAW types in range.

Of course, being more than one of slow and underarmoured means you die in
an ugly manner.
	
PV 1000 Meson Screen : 81 470 m3, 60 202t, 40 000 m2, 4000 MW, MCr 8010

This baby needs 210 crew, and stops a 40 000 megajoule meson gun dead, or a
100 000 megajoule meson gun at 1.5 times it\'s effective range.

The bad news is it requires 80% of the surface area of a 80 000
displacement ton ship, and about 8% of the displacement.

This is an insane investment, unless you *know* the enemy uses meson guns
smaller than this, and you have thicker armour than their best PAWs can
penetrate.

In that case, our hypothetical brick can take anything the enemy can throw
at it and still smile.

This is another potential strategic advantage of the Third Imperium - they
could build entire fleets dedicated to different tactical concepts, and
pick the one needed for the campaign as and when needed - if Enemy X likes
big PAW armed rocks, then bring bigger Meson-armed rocks. If enemy Y likes
skinny agile ships with long-range but weak meson guns, then take fast
ships with thick meson screens. And if enemy Z believe in small fighters
mounting det laser missiles, then take lots of nuke dampers, and so on.

The enemy, on the other hand, would not be able to optimise against a Third
Imperium standard fleet, because there isnt one.

   A nice bit of handwaving to cover Lucas\' mistake.  Logical, but it
still doesn\'t change the fact that the units were originally confused
though....

T4.1 is still being developed - people on the TML have seen the drafts a
few months ago - and I can remember Marc Miller stating that it will be
delayed until it is *right*.

Sure - I realise how the transponder works (but thanks for the explaination
anyway). The question popped into my head when driving home at night,
looking at the distance that I could see with my lights, and the distance
at which I could see other vehicles... I was wondering if there was any use
in a Traveller setting  for this.

In light of this information, perhaps the boast was not just about Han
Solo, but also about his ship and it\'s compliment (the crew that is).  I\'ve
never read the unnamed novel, but it makes better sense now than my
original supposition did.  Thanks Mr. Whipple.

The Kessel run is based on a group of three massive black holes that orbit
each other. The term of running the kessel run in however many parsecs
meant how close to the event horizon of the black hole they could get. It
was not meant as a time reference. This was in the Jedi Academy trilogy.

Hope this clears up any confusion on this topic.

Well, what you are looking for is those modifiers described in
terms that Traveller fans are used to.  In my GURPS Traveller
article I used...

Easy          +3
Average        0
Difficult     -3
Formidible    -6
Staggering    -9
Impossible   -12

However, with hindsight I might make Staggering a -8
and Impossible a -10.

A couple of points.

1.  The weapons ranges on the Coronation are in 300,000km increments.

2.  I was attempting to reproduce the oft-mentioned 90kton Battleship.  I
feel I succeeded.

3.  FFS2 allows more detail from the design.  I included space for
armories, a medium security brig, several crew gymnasiums, drop capsule
facilities, mess halls, etc.  This takes up space but is more realistic.

When finished, I had about 200 *liters* of space left and a power overage a
few hundred Watts.  This design is tight.

They do have large knives, which are deadly in close combat.

to Andy Akins for his splendid spreadsheet!) and since Doug Berry\'s showing
us his pre-IG-ification naval designs....

Anyone remember the Chrysanthemum-class destroyer escort from Classic
Traveller\'s Supplement 9, *Fighting Ships*?  I\'d like to use one as the
base for a GURPS: Traveller game I\'m starting soon, so I thought I\'d see
what one looks like under T4\'s FF&S.

The hull shape is a compromise between the illustration and what I
calculate the dimensions ought to be (if the design passes muster I
promise deck plans online within a month or two).  I\'ve changed the
particle accelerator turrets to parallel mounts in the interest of
effectiveness, and turned the dual fusion-gun turret into a triad of
laser barbettes (I had space and power to spare).  Now I think on it,
I probably ought to put in a nuclear damper instead, since _all_ space
combat missiles now seem to be det-lasers.

Does the following do the ship justice as well as make good design and
military sense?

whatever: it\'s only loosely adapted from Andy\'s spreadsheet output).

From S9: "The *Chrysanthemum* class destroyer escort is a small, fast
vessel intended for fleet and squadron escort duties.  The design is old,
but efficient, with examples of the ship serving in the Imperial Navy for
over a century.  *Chrysanthemums* are ubiquitous, being encountered with
larger fleet elements as well as working alone.

	"This class of destroyer escort has been pressed into service in a
variety of non-escort duties, including orbital patrols, police
operations, garrison duties, and even limited strike missions."

I was once called into a game some roomies were having with their
semi-munchkin friends. Seems they\'d managed to blow up some ships that
used *lots* of the old "jump capacitors" as auxilary storage for
weapons and the like. 

They figured that the blast might get a few other ships. I got the info
about the ships and sat down with a calculator. My frst pass at a
solution required turning back to them and asking for the stats on the
*rest* of the fleets involved, as well as their positions.

My "best guess" for the fireball had them causing cratering and blast
effects on the planet. They were at geosynch altitude....

Since it had been a bit of "internal warfare" between some would-be
megacorps, I suggested to the ref (and he agreed!) that the Imperium
was looking for anyone connected with either side as "war criminals".

What does "Metronic", "M.P.D", and "d.m" mean in this context?

Also, you realize that the emrgency speed is 100,000 times greater that
then flank speed?  That\'s some after burner!

That\'s essentially how garum was made. And soy sauce was made by doing
something similar with a block of soy curd.

For that matter, beer was made by a not too diiferent method.

In *all* of these, the trick is in getting the *right* bacteria/yeast
to work on the raw material, and excluding others.

BASESTAR - Cylon, a slow moving, not easily maneuverable deep spacecraft.
They are believed to carry over 300 fighters, and have two long range
mega-ulsars and over 100 laser turrets.

BATTLESTAR - A deep spacecraft assembled in planetary orbit with a maximum
before fueling range of 500 light-yahrens.

Major Colonial Time Terms

millenium (1000 years)
1000 yahrens, or 1000 years. According to Adar\'s speech in the pilot
episode, the Galacticans were approaching the 7th millenium of time, which
would place their calendar in the late 6900\'s. There seems to be at least
two Colonial calendars, for the Cylon raid on Umbra occured in 7322, some 20
yahren before the events in "The Man with Nine Lives". The second figure
displaces the earlier figure by some 300 yahren or so.

yahren (year)
The yahren (yah\'-rain) best represents the Colonial year, as both terms are
used interchangeably in the series. In one case year was substituted for
yahren in the dialog. In President Adar\'s statement in the pilot, he utters
"The first peace man has known in a thousand years.".Therefore the yahren is
the Colonial year. The plural can be represented as both yahren and yahrens.
Taken from the German word for year.

sectar (month?)
The sectar (sec\'-tar), and its plural sectares (sec-tar\'-ays), or sometimes
sectars , is used mostly in the context of space distance, much as micron
and centon are. In "Lost Planet of the Gods", Lucifer measured the distance
between the Galactica and Baltar\'s base ship in sectares. A hidden
assumption is that sectar is to secton what centar is to centon, a unit
composed of an unknown number of sectons. Using a base ten system, a sectar
could represent 10 sectons (or weeks). See micron for units that also double
as units of space distance.

secton (week)

The secton (sec\'-tawn) best represents the Colonial week. In "The Man With
Nine Lives", Apollo complains to Starbuck about how he lost a secton\'s pay
to one of Starbuck\'s gambling schemes. A purely arbirary definition of
secton would be 100 centares, as 100 is the base for at least one other time
unit (centar). There are compelling reasons to adopt this definition, as
explained later in this document.

centar (hour)
The centar (sen\'-tar) and its plural, centares (sen-tar\'-ays), or sometimes
centars, is the Colonial hour. In "Baltar\'s Escape", Baltar gave Adama three
centares to give in to his demands. The centar is probably 100 centons, for
in "Take the Celestra", the Celestra\'s mutineering crew says that the
Galactica would be within its viewing range within a centar. The captain,
who does not want the ship to be seen, instructs the crew to hail the
Galactica within 80 centons. In "Take the Celestra", the crew were subjected
to 16 centares intervals of work, the Colonial equivalent of
double-shifting. There is an unknown time unit representing a 24 centar
interval. For example, in "The Lost Warrior", Adama gave Starbuck and Boomer
24 centares to rescue Apollo. This unknown interval is best understood as a
day, which constitutes 24 hours. Note, the Latin word for 100 is cent.

centon (minute)
In all but the first two episodes, centon (sen\'-tawn) represents the
Colonial minute. Witness the use of the expression "wait a centon," the
Colonial version of "wait a minute." In "Gun on Ice Planet Zero", Starbuck
and Apollo\'s chronometers were synchronized to 80 centons, the length of
their mission to blow up the Ravishol Pulsar. For a discussion of the first
two episodes and the original centon, see the next section.

micron (second)
The micron is best understood as the Colonial second. A centon is 100
microns, for when Apollo\'s counter hits one centon in "Gun On Ice Planet
Zero", it starts counting down from 100 to 1. The micron is also used as a
term of space distance in the series. When Rigel tells the fleet that the
Cylon patrol craft are "three microns and closing," she is using micron in
the same way that we use the expression light year. A light year represents
the distant light travels within one year. Here micron represents the
distance covered in one micron within an unknown fixed velocity. No relation
to the Terran micron, or micrometer (one millionth of a meter.)

The First Two Episodes - Centon versus Senton
The discussion in this section covers units used almost exclusively in the
pilot and "Lost Planet of the Gods", including the possible original context
of centon. The time units used in these episodes seem to conform to a
different system than those used in other episodes. These include senton,
millisenton, and microsenton. The units here are more obviously metric than
those used outside these episodes. A different spelling for senton is used
here to distinguish it from the centon used throughout the rest of the
series.

senton (week)
While it is well known that centon substituted well for minute in the
series, the pilot episode provides compelling evidence that this was not
always the case. At the Council session dealing with Carillon, Apollo
informs the Council that Adama\'s plan would take the fleet sentons out of
the way from its intended destination (Carillon). Later, Sire Uri informs
the fleet that the voyage might resume within a senton. The senton may have
originally been intended to represent the original Colonial week,
represented by secton in most of the series. Although the senton-as-day
seems to work as well as the senton-as-week, the presence of two other time
units, microsentons and millisentons, and their respective metric
conventions, supports the latter view. It is suggested that the Colonials
redefined senton at one point to reflect "minute" (spelled as centon in this
document), and that senton represents a pre-Destruction use of the term. The
other two terms almost disappeared from the series.

millisenton (10 minutes)
This unit is used usually in the context of a few minutes. In "Lost Planet
of the Gods", Adama says that they have been dining for three millisentons.
Only one other episode uses this unit. In "The Living Legend", Sheba informs
the mission crew that they have only a few millisentons to get in and out of
Gamoray. Using the senton-as-week theory, the millisenton becomes 1/1000 of
a senton (or secton). Therefore, a millisenton constitutes 10 centons (or 10
minutes.) Adama\'s repast, therefore, becomes 30 minutes, a reasonable legnth
of time to eat. In the pilot, in the beginning of the Carillon sequences
Greenbeam informs Apollo that is landram is 24 millisentons from the Tylium
mine. That\'s 240 centons or 4 hours if a centon represents one minute.

microsenton (second)
Used by Starbuck in "Lost Planet of the Gods", in the context of one second.
This unit was later taken over by the unit by micron, which was used
exclusively in the first two episodes as a unit of space distance. In the
metric system, micro represents one millionth. Using the senton-as-week
rule, the microsenton becomes 1 millionth of a senton. If the senton (or
secton) represents exactly 1 Earth week, the microsenton (or micron) would
clock at 0.6 seconds.
Minor Colonial Time Units

quarton (week/fortnight/month)
In "The Magnificent Warriors", Adama complained that "I\'ve been cooped up on
this ship for 16 quartons." Adama\'s last previous excursion off the ship was
in the episide "Lost Planet of the Gods". Possibly a week, fortnight (14
days) or a month. The time period between the two episodes would be a choice
between 4 and 16 months. A quarton equivalent to one secton (week) causes
the least problems. The quarton is derived from the Latin word for four.

A Sample Conversion Table
Based on the pseudo-metric used in the series, and a base 100 ratio, here is
a sample table for the four main Colonial units, using secton as exactly one
week. Note, the centon is almost exactly one minute, for there are 10,080
minutes within an Earth week, and 10,000 centons within a secton.
secton - 1 week
centar - 101 minutes (1.7 hours)
centon - 1 minute
micron - 0.6 seconds
This is an extremely attractive conversion table, and conforms to the hidden
assumptions for each of the four basic units. All tables present their own
set of problems. The double-shift on the Celestra consisting of 16 centares
is equivalent to almost 27 hours of non-stop work. We know from the episode
that 16 centares represents an extraordinary length of time for a work
shift. The Colonials may have a higher capacity for duration between sleep
cycles. With this in mind, the 27 hour shift becomes slightly more
palatable.

Once, when we were playing a fantasy game we spent a session and a week
game time chasing after a ship called the \'Scarlet Herring" that we thought
had some cargo we were after on it. It was painful when the reality about
the name dawned...

So the cards are intended to be a kind of "supercounter" for combat?  I
can live with that, as long as I get the rest of the data as well.  

That makes something like Emperor\'s vehicles a bit more comprehensible -
although it _still_ needed to provide the basic design data.  I\'ve heard
that Imperial Squadrons has the same flaw - cards witout details - but as
IG still hasn\'t shipped mine I don\'t know for certain.

Sorry, I didn\'t make myself very clear - the writer should be allowed to 
choose how he is paid: cash, or CPs, but at a better rate than if they\'d 
bought them. eg if CP cost $15 each, and a writer is owed $30, he could take 
the money or *3* CP (ie at $10 each).

I tracked down the writers\' guide on the net (sorry, lost the URL, but it\'s 
easy to find). It says:


TIMES

Centon - (sentonn) - equivalent of a minute

Micron - a tenth of a centon


So it seems you\'re right - rather than using a unit of length incorrectly, 
they\'re using it as a unit of time!

However, in the introduction it says:


You\'ll also find that some of the definitions of terms here contradict the 
context the terms were used in and some spellings that defy the 
pronunciations uttered on the show. 

The bottom line is, it is what it is. Enjoy. 


....so maybe we\'re both right.

Some other gems:


CONSUMABLES - Cylon word for food

CRAWLON - Spider [I just love that one!]

DI-ETHANE - Type of blizzardy storm

FUMARELLO - Cigar

PLUTON - Poisonous substance generated from fallout of neutron elements 
which contaminates food

For Sagan\'s sake - For God\'s sake

TUCANAS - Feline, three-dimensional creatures - singers on Carillon [as 
opposed to most of the characters, who barely had 1 dimension...]

Parsec (parseck) - 90 million miles (distance between sun & Earth)

Hectare (hecktarr) - nine million miles


I take back everything I said - this is wonderful!

Essentially, it is a TL10 det laser missile that can pull 5 gees for one
hour that has it\'s own PEMS and computer system, as well as a long-range
communicator.

At about MCr3, they are reasonably cheap, as military systems go, and are
designed to be "seeded" at strategic points in the system.

The theory is that you seed the area with both real mines and fake ones.
Sneaky commodores will have some of them painted with military black, and
some with bare metal skins, so an intruder will be more uncertain as to the
number of potential threats. 

Whilst not a threat to a serious military force, they should dissuade light
raiding forces from annoying strategic points in the system.

Cheaper systems leave out the PEMS and flight computer, and are flown as
command controlled mines. They cost MCr 1.42 apiece.

Exceptioanlly cheap systems leave out everything bar engine and batteries,
and have a much cheaper 300 000km laser communicator. They cost KCr 103 in
total, and are essentially decoys.

Just the sphere of crystaliron costs KCr 9.5.

More technically advanced mines would include the abomination known as
fusion plus as a power source, which would radically reduce the weight of
the battery suite, and thus increase the performance of the missile. The
demand for surface area of TAKAFP may make a more needle like shape more
efficient, as the increased armour needed for the surface area would be
compensated for by the greater weight efficiency of TAKAFP versus batteries.

It has a basic signature of -1.5, and an emitted signature of either -1.5
or 0, depending on whether or not the HEPLAR engine is being powered.
Personally, I think a HEPLAR engine in use would stand out to passive
sensors like dogs balls.

Getting the crystaliron sphere painted with military black at a TL11
factory would cost MCr 33.2 or so, so I dont think it\'s worth it.

FWIW a sensitivity 7.5 sensor should detect it at about 500 000km. A
sensitivity 6.5 sensor may have to get to within 50 000km.

Note that these mines are both bigger than "standard" space combat missiles
and spherical. Therefore any use of them in a spaceship will require a
custom launcher.

It\'s covered in "The Regency Sourcebook - Keepers of the Flame" one of the
last books GDW did.  Unfortunatly I don\'t remember a lot about it.  The
empress is "The Emperess Wave", I don\'t really remember what that is,
something about a psychic wave covering hundreds of lightyears, eminating
from the core and headed towards the Imperium.  It had apparently caused
the Zhodani coreward expeditions some serious trouble!

>>> Does a pound of silver weigh the same
>>> as a pound of iron?

>>You\'re joking?

No, I wasn\'t joking.

>>And which falls to the earth faster?

Essentially they will fall at the same rate; however, 
if you\'re splitting hairs, the pound of silver will hit 
the ground first (even though it weighs less).

>>A *pound* of iron weighs one pound, as does
>> a *pound* of feathers.  That\'s about as old as
>> methuselah!

You\'ll get no arguments with me there.  Iron and 
feathers are both common substances.

The subject under discussion when the question 
was posed was one of Measures and Standards.  
The key word here is Standards.  There is a 
different standard for precious metals (like silver) 
than there is for common substances (like iron 
and feathers).  So, the two questions about 
comparable weights are fundamentally different.

In the English (or Imperial) Standards, there are 
three sub-groupings  of Weight and mass.  They 
are the Avoirdupois, Apothecaries\' and Troy.

The first is the one used when measuring common 
substances (like iron and feathers).  It is probably 
the one most people think of when they hear terms 
like pounds and ounces.  The second is used when 
referring to the things you might find in an 
apothecary shop (chemist\'s, drug store or 
pharmacy, depending upon your society).  The final 
one is used when referring to precious metals (like 
silver).  There is also another group that Americans 
do not use.  I don\'t know about the Australians or 
Canadians (who I understand have pretty much 
completely gone metric).  They are refereed (at 
least in the US) as "Special British Units".

These three systems have 3 unit names in common, 
the grain, the ounce and the pound.  Only the first of 
these is the same in all three.  A grain (abbreviated 
gr.) weighs c. 64.8 milligrams and is the unit that 
makes them one system.

Here is a run down on the three systems...
====================================
Avoirdupois
1 dram (dr.)                   =              27.34375 gr.
1 ounce (oz.)                 =     16 dr.  = 437.5 gr.
1 pound (lb.)                  =     16 oz. =      7 k gr.
1 hundredweight (cwt.) =   100 lb.  =  700 k gr.
1 short ton (s.t.)             = 2000 lb.  =   14 M gr.
- ----
Special British Units (a subset of Avoirdupois)
1 stone (st.)          =            14 lb. =         98 k gr.
1 hundredweight (cwt.) = 112 lb. =       784 k gr.
1 long ton (l.t.)      =        2,240 lb. = 15,680 k gr.
====================================
Apothecaries
1 scruple (s. ap.) =                            20 gr.
1 dram (dr. ap.)   =    4 s. ap. =        80 gr.
1 ounce (oz. ap.) =    8 dr. ap. =    640 gr.
1 pound (lb. ap.)  = 12 oz. ap. = 7,680 gr.
====================================
Troy
1 pennyweight (dwt.) =                        24 gr.
1 ounce (oz. t.)           = 20 dwt. =     480 gr.
1 pound (lb. t.)            = 12 oz.   = 5,760 gr.
====================================

Length and distance has 4 standards (Customary, 
Nautical, Surveyor\'s (or Gunters\') chain and 
Engineers\' chain), which I will not detail.   And the 
ones for Volume and Capacity are even worse with 
6 different standards and distinctions are made 
between liquid and dry units.

I know this distinction has gotten rather long and I 
apologize, but, I did warn you and there is a 
Traveller link.

If you want to have a little fun with your players along 
the lines of "The Scarlet Herring*," then you can 
include a planet where the Standards and 
Measures are English (not Imperial, that might be 
confusing) and the Tourist\'s Guide says, "A local 
pound is half a standard kilogram)

You could have a local offer to sell your intrepid 
adventurers a thousand pounds of gold, silver, 
platinum, osmium, etc. at 5 to 10% below standard 
costs.  Imagine their surprise when they learn that 
what they are getting is only 75% of what they 
thought it was.  

*Which in my campaign was called "The Russet 
Clupeid."  For months after it\'s inclusion, the 
players were looking up obscure names to find 
new clues.  When they quit looking up every 
name, I included the "The Phaux Clew."

Actually, why could the writers both be published AND get CPs?  IG still
benefits because talented (and meglamaniacal (sp?), at least as far as T4
goes!) authors will produce more material for IG to publish than they might
otherwise do.  We untalented wannabes could still *purchase* our titles in
the time-honored fashion, but the movers and shakers in T4 would get titles
as an added bonus for their hard work, WITHOUT with-holding their money...

I started to ask you why you thought that a writer should get a better break
than anyone else?  But, I guess that all of us would benefit from the
writing, so perhaps this suggestion is not out of order.  I guess I am
exhibiting my herd tendencies.

I detected a political tirade coming on here, so I quit.

Marc or whoever is handling such matters, might also want to consider
offering other premiums.  Like on design contests.

And why not mix and match.  If you had $30.00 coming for an article written,
why not take $10.00 and 2 CP or $20.00 and a CP.

For The Greater Good: A Fantasy Novel by MJ Dougherty

..................
Four thousand years ago, human civilisation reached its peak. Thaumaturgy
dominated the world, power\'s key and its tool. Then the mages fought among
themselves for supremacy.

Continents were shattered. Nations obliterated. Nature warped to serve
warfare\'s ends. 
Humanity tottered on the brink of extinction. The climb back was long and
hard, but finally science has replaced magic. With the steam engine and
gunpowder has come new opportunity for the comman man. No more do mages
rule the shivering hordes. The days of Empire are a long-ago nightmare. 

But now the nations are marching.

A conspiracy of Thaumaturges seeks to recreate the old Empire. Their tool
is the powerful nation of Vildor. Only weak Torgin and her estranged allies
remain free. If Torgin falls, the Empire will come anew. 

And all humanity will be slaves forever.

As her armies are driven steadily back, all Torgin\'s hope turns to Jervon
Dessartes, a disgraced cavalry officer. Dessartes was once a hero, but
there has been no place for heroes in Torgin for many years. Brought from
exile, Dessartes is offered a chance to redeem himself. His mission is
simple, and impossible:

Enter the blasted wildlands and retrieve a weapon from the Empire War. 
Destroy the invaders before Torgin falls. 

Or die trying.

Dessartes faces the terrors of the Empire War, opposition from within his
own government, and the possibility of a traitor among his companions. His
own loyalties are divided.

Yet the fate of a nation rests in his unwilling hands.

   Without reading my supplements, I\'ll try and give you the gist.

   Project Longbow (LONG Baseline Observation Window) uses aperture
synthesis to create a virtual antenna literally light-years across.
(Aperture synthesis is a method of using multiple smaller antennae to
simulate the existance of one much larger antenna. Resolution of the
antenna is equal to an actual antenna of the intended size, but offers
much lower total sensitivity)

    The system (the largest of it\'s kind) was created by the Imperium in
the 800\'s, intended for long-range observation of the galactic core (and
the Zhodani) All references to the project were classified DEEP SECRET
throughout it\'s entire existance. Even though observations were not made
in Real Time (because of the lightspeed lag) large amounts of useful data
were collected on Zhodani shipping patterns and the core expeditions.

   Beyond a range of 1500 parsecs, whose radiation had been travelling for
4900+ years, the Zhodani had not yet arrived in the observational window.

   The Longbow collector plane was located in the Depot/Lishun (1219
Lishun) system as part of the large Navy facility there, aiding it\'s
concealment. The collector plane was a disk of BILLIONS of linked receiver
elements 46 *billion* kilometers in diameter, the size of the 12th orbital
disk. This collector yielded a resolution at 1500 parsecs of 10 _meters_
in long-wavelength IR, and _one_half_meter_ in visible wavelengths!

    Longbow II, a more ambitious project learning from Longbow, was
started by Strephon in 1103. This project would use the ENTIRE WIDTH of
the Imperium as it\'s baseline! With sensor loci placed everywhere in the
Spinward Marches and Antares sectors, in resolution (but not sensitivity)
Longbow II replicated a sensor dish of 160 _parsecs_ in diameter,
sensitive in all electromagnetic bands from X-ray all the way through
visible wavelengths and IR down to long-wavelength radio. Longbow II would
be able to achieve a theoretical resolution of 0.05 _centimeters_ at a
range of 8000 parsecs! (the distance to the galactic core)

   One difference between Longbow I and II, however, was that though
Longbow I had it\'s resolution in both the vertical and horizontal planes,
Longbow II only had it\'s spectacular resolution available in the
horizontal, spread along the galactic plane as it was. 

   Longbow II data was to have been collected at all listening points
along the bowline, and carried by Jump-6 "Imperiallines" couriers to the
"focal point" at Depot/Lishun where the data would have been synchronized
(using such phenomena as pulsars in the common field of view), compiled,
filtered, and computer enhanced. 

    However, the calibration of such a huge array was expected to take
decades, if not longer, before any _meaningful_ observations could be
made. The Civil War intervened, destroying the Project. All Longbow II
data is believed to be lost.

    Note that the data above is "common knowledge", I\'ll leave the
cloak&dagger stuff for a spoiler...

   What you want is the Regency Sourcebook (Out of print).  It\'s a TNE
product. As far as I know, they only have basis in TNE so far.  To summarize
from the players section:  
    LONG Baseline Observation Window was created in the 800s for observation
of the Galactic Core and the Zhodani Core Expeditions.  It uses apeture
synthesis (pg 50 of the Original Fire, Fusion, and Steel).  Strephon was here,
observing the Empress Wave, when Dulinor assasinated his double.

>Yes I know, it\'s a long-range communication project that was abandoned. Yet

This "long range communication project" was only a cover story (and it only
appears in Survival Margin).  It was more accurately a super large sensor
designed to study the Zhodani Core Expeditions.  In other words, to spy.

Apparently a code name for a personal Agent of the Emperor.  Most of the
Longbow staff were psionic, so i\'m assuming "Pentecost" is like Strephon\'s
Right Hand Sophont (at least in regards to Longbow, maybe more).

Longbow was a sensor array the stretched across the width of the Imperium.
By using careful measurements from the Longbow sites to cooridnate the
observations, the Imperium had a synthetic aperture several hundred parsecs
across.

The Empress Wave is a psionic (in part) event advancing from the core of
the galaxy at lightspeed.  Humans with psionic abilities who are exposed to
the wavefront experience a vision of a woman described as "regal" holding a
staff of some sort, surveying a clityscape.  All observers describe the
scene as "pregnant" or "something just about to happen."

The wave is evidently responsible for the collapse of the remarkably stabel
Zhodani Consulate.  By the time of the Regency, Zhodani refugees are
beginning to flood across the border, bringing tales of warfare and madness.

That\'s all that\'s given in offcial documents.  I read a "what-if" warp up
story on someone\'s web page.  Can\'t remember where at the moment.

Of _course_ not!  As they pointed out after the caper where they shut

Here\'s a frightening thought: assign Nuku-Nuku and Eimi as a backup team

And to think that _I_ came down hard on a group of players for detonating

     Well the Rebellion Sourcebook says that the Illelish Guard (being from
Dulinors Domain) was stocked w/ troops loyal to him and they picked off all of
the personal guards while Dulinor took out the Emperor, the Empress, the
Yerla-whatever ambassador and the Grand Princess.  To top it off, they had all
the other guards ammunition substitued w/ dummies (or was it blanks?).
Ammunition must be different in the 58 Century, since I can recognize the
(lack of) primer on a dummy and the lack of projectile (on a blank).   Well,
it could be they put a round on the blank (wasn\'t that how Brandon Lee was
killed?) or just put some fake primer on. (and possibly paint the tip the
appropriate Imperial color).  Ah well.

   Sounds like the Imperial storm troopers in Star Wars.  Perhaps they
bought their electronic sights (the ones that are always misaligned so
they hit about half a meter to the left or right of the target) from the
same store in Hollywood.  :-)

   I had forgotten about those.  Nasty things now that you mention it.

   You forgot about their tendency to do suicide runs into the fighter
bays of the Galactica.  You almost get the impression that the Colonial
fighters were merely a distraction that kept them from their real
goal--disable the Galactica and render the rest of the fleet
defenseless.  Sound tactics actually.

   So strafing innocent civilians as they did in the pilot was fine then

Hollywood coincidences.

From the various Canon accounts (Rebellion Sourcebook and Digest #9), there
doesn\'t seem to have been one, period.  Security is supposed to be provided
by two honor guards: one drawn from the military services, and one drawn
from each Archduke\'s domain.

When Dulinor assasinated Strephon, the military guard was present, but their
weapons were useless, since they had been issued blanks by a palace armorer 
under Dulinor\'s control.  The Domain guard was from Dulinor\'s own domain, and
(of course) was comprised only of individuals loyal to Dulinor.  During the
assasination attempt, the domain guards were tasked with eliminating the
Emperor\'s military guards.

The assasination itself was conducted immediately after Strephon greeted
Dulinor, and therefore at effectively contact range.  Even had there been
such a detail present, there would have been no way to get into position in
time.

It\'s worth noting that an Aslan ambassador did manage to interpose himself
between Dulinor and the Princess.  Unfortunately, this only caused Dulinor
to expend an extra bullet.

The material on Project Longbow is copied verbatim from the Library Data
section of the TNE: The Regency Sourcebook and, as such, is copyrighted in
full by Far Futures.  This posting and future postings are in response to
Marc Miller\'s request for the info.  By the way, if you all get the chance
to pick up a copy of the Sourcebook, it\'s worth it (IMHO) just for the
background on the technological breakthroughs which are (will be?) starting
to happen around 1200+.

GENERAL INFO

Project Longbow: "Long" Baseline Observation Window, the name for a
system created in the 800s for observation of the galactic core and
the Zhodani axis of exploration toward the core. Longbow was the
largest known application of aperture synthesis (see Fire, Fusion, &
Steel page 50) ever constructed, and was a deep Imperial secret
throughout its existence. Longbow was created to observe the Zhodani
core expeditions, and, after many decades of data accumulation and
calibration was actually able to measure Zhodani shipping activity
along the core axis. Because sensor signatures propagate at the speed
of light, the observations were not in real time. Rather, the deeper
into the core the sensor "looked", the older the signatures. Beyond a
range of 1500 parsecs, whose EMS radiation had been traveling for
about 4900 years, the Zhodani had not yet arrived in the time-space
observation window or TSOW (1100-4900= -3800, and the first Zhodani
Core Expedition only began in -4000). Thus the first Zhodani
expedition was being observed at a range of around 1500 parsecs while
the seventh expedition (which departed in 750) was being observed at
a range of only 110 parsecs in the year 1100. Observations of more
recent events could only be made by moving the observing sensors
nearer the target. (Conversely, observations of older events could be
made by moving to an observation point much farther away from the
event. Naturally this capability was only possible with jump drives
that could move observers faster than light itself.)
   The Longbow collector plane was located in the Depot/Lishun
(1219 Lishun) system as part of the sprawling Imperial Navy facility
there, aiding in its concealment. The collector plane was a disk of
billions of linked receiver elements 46 billion kilometers in diameter,
the size of the orbit 12 orbital disk (TNE page 195). This collector
yielded a resolution at 1500 parsecs of 10 meters in long-wavelength
infrared, and of half a meter in visible light.
   Strephon was at Depot/Lishun observing Longbow activities when
Dulinor assassinated one of his ceremonial doubles at Capital on
132/1116.
   A more ambitious project, Longbow II, based on the lessons learned
from the first Longbow, was begun under Strephon\'s direction in 1103.
This project would use the entire width of the Imperium as its long
baseline. With its sensor termini located in the Spinward Marches and
Antares Sectors, in resolution but not sensitivity, Longbow replicated a
passive sensor dish with a diameter of 160 parsecs (30 trillion
kilometers), sensitive in all electronic bands, from gamma and x-rays
down through visible light and infrared all the way to long-wavelength
radio. Longbow would be able to achieve a theoretical resolution of 0.05
centimeters at a range of 8000 parsecs, the distance to the galactic
core. However, unlike the original Longbow whose disk-shaped receiver
provided two-dimension resolution (width and length), Longbow II\'s long
baseline lay only in the width dimension, along the galactic plane. This
meant that this spectacular theoretical resolution was only in width,
not height. Longbow II data was to have been collected at all of the
listening points along the "bowline" and carried by jump-6 Imperiallines
couriers to its "focal point" at Depot/Lishun where the data would have
been synchronized (by such methods as pulsar emissions within the common
field of view of all the sensors), compiled, filtered, and enhanced by
lengthy and demanding computer runs.
   However, the calibration of such a complicated system was expected to
require decades if not centuries before meaningful observations on the
galactic core could be extracted, but the Civil War intervened,
destroying the project. All Longbow II data is presumed to have been
lost.

The following material is taken verbatim from the Referees Only section
of the TNE: Regency Sourcebook and, as such, is fully copyrighted by Far
Futures. Please bear in mind while you\'re reading that any text referred

REFEREES ONLY

   The Library Data entry is correct, although incomplete. After its
creation, the Longbow project became an umbrella organization for a
variety of long-range observation and intelligence gathering systems
focused on the Zhodani and galactic core, which included natural and
augmented psionics as well as the Longbow II project already discussed.
These included smaller versions of the Longbow VLB array, but placed
much closer to the core, many sectors to coreward of the Vargr extents.
These observations were carried across the light years to the Imperium
by relays of couriers, similar to the old Xboat network.
   Many of these observations were connected to ongoing psionic
research, particularly attempts to isolate the physical phenomena (as
opposed to supranormal phenomena, see Psionics, below) associated with
psionic activity. So in addition to collecting and processing EMS data
in the normal fashion, this EMS data was examined for evidence of
psionic activity by wiring human psions into the loop.
   Although there was little unambiguous evidence of psionic signals
being received this way, the research was continued as a great number of
useful data was being generated. (This included the creation of baseline
data on how typical EMS signals are perceived by psionic perception
which had many useful applications in signals processing technology, the
establishment of data protocols that would allow electronic storage of
telepathic or teleperceptive visions for later observation by other
psions, and, entirely by accident, the discovery of the amounts of
electronic information that could be pushed through a human brain
without burning portions of it out.
   Longbow observations in the last years before the disintegration of
the Imperium showed what appeared to be space combat along the core
axis, headed toward the Zhodani Consulate. Regency intelligence
agencies believe that this was connected to the observation of unusual
Zhodani naval activity in 1119 (see Survival Margin, pages 22-23).
These events presumably prompted the hasty core expedition of 1149
which ended in failure, and is in turn connected to the current
upheavals behind the Exodus.
   However, the final dramatic Longbow observation was actually
connected to the Imperium\'s disintegration, as it was the reason for
Strephon\'s absence from Capital on the day Dulinor assassinated one
of his doubles (see Survival Margin, pages 7-9). It was one of the
few unambiguous examples of the reception of psionic signals across
interstellar distances, and was dramatic enough and connected to
enough other events that it required the emperor\'s personal attention.
   The signal was carried by a normal EMS wavefront emanating from
the core, although of great strength and coherence. It was perceived
by psions as a human female, dressed in black, standing before a city
skyline. Also in the background was a scene of a desert with two
astronomical bodies hanging above the horizon.*
   This vision was projected into Strephon\'s mind by psion Jonathan
Crocker, the psionic relay on duty at the Longbow focal point during
Strephon\'s visit. Both Crocker and Strephon agreed that the vision
was not a "still picture," but a motion picture of a pregnant moment,
waiting for an event or a message to be delivered, in Crocker\'s
words, "one of those moments when the birds suddenly stop singing for
no reason." Whether this was their joint perception of a real
phenomenon or simply Strephon responding to Crocker\'s impression
embedded in the projection is not know.
   The woman was holding a staff which may have been technological in
function, and had a bearing of great, even regal, dignity which was
enhanced by the perceived timelessness of the image. Strephon
immediately began thinking of the woman as an empress.

Well, actually, in the first sequence we see the Stormtroopers in 
(boarding the Tantive IV), they do kill people. Lots of them. Just 
look at those Rebels fall... (YEAH!)

On the other side, our heroes have Dodge skills of 7D+, so... (I have 
discovered the secret of high skills in Star Wars... A Dodge above 7D 
is a so-called "cinematic dodge", where instead of moving out of the 
way, the Heroe subconsciously uses the force to deflect the shot.

Even if we are talking about bars of the same mass there are many other
complications at work.

If you wish to be truly pedantic about the whole thing I must point out
that silver is denser than iron.  Therefore one pound of silver will be
smaller than one pound of iron.  If you are not in a vaccuum the larger
bar of iron will have a great wind resistance than the bar of silver,
therefore it will fall more slowly.

Your original statement was that you were releasing these bars from an
equal height.  However since the bar of iron is larger than the bar of
silver its center of mass will not be in the same place as the center of
mass of the bar of silver.  if the bottoms of the two bars are at an
equal height the center of mass of the iron bar will be at a higher
altitude.  If the centers of mass of the two bars are at an equal height
the bottom of the bar of iron will be lower.

If the bars of silver are carefully calculated to have the same unit
mass per unit of height, and therefore have their vertical centers of
mass at the same height the iron bar will have to be wider, longer, or
both.

Another question that arises is whether the bars are being dropped with
their long axis parallel to or perpendicular to the ground ?  Are they
being dropped like this
	_____		_________

or like this ?			

			|
	|		|
	|		|
	|		|
	|		|
			|

To be even more pedantic I should note that silver and iron have
different heat conductivities and therefore will absorb a differing
ammount of heat from the air during the fall.  They also have different
albedos and will therefore absorb a different ammount of light, and
therefore heat, from whatever source of illumination, if any, is
present.  Therefore the bars will be at different temperatures.  The
warmer bars molecules will be moving faster and it will have expanded
more during the fall.  Therefore it will not have to fall as far and
will strike the ground first ceteris paribus.  We should also note that
the bars do not merely fall toward the earth their mass also pulls the
earths mass toward them.  Since the iron bar is less dense the effect of
its atoms pulling on the earth mass have a different effect than the
atoms of the silver bar, which will be closer together, will.  Since
iron is more reactive than silver the iron bar will react with the
oxygen in the air (rust) more than the silver bar will during the period
of their fall.  Therefore it will add oxygen atoms to its outer surface
thereby increasing its mass during the course of the fall.  Therefore
two bars that mass the same ammount at time of release will not mass the
same at the moment of impact.  

All of these effects are so small that they can be ignored "in real
life" but they do exist.

A TL9 32 m long, 4 m diameter PAW takes up 937 m3, masses 1412 tons, costs
MCr 47 and takes up 12.57m2 of surface area. It puts out 1024 megajoules to
38 000 kilometers, which translates to a damage value of 156 (i.e. it
punches 7.5 cm of superdense). The beam pointer is a 90 000km model.

It requires an input of 5120 megajoules, so a 90 megawatt power plant will
allow a shot every minute.

Now, on one hand this is appallingly short range. On the other hand, it
isnt that bad for TL9 - better than most sane and reasonable TL9 lasers
manage, for example.

I could imagine a number of worlds with these guarding military bases on
airless moons, or with these in orbit, encased by some ungodly thickness of
composite laminates.

Look what you guys made me do!  I oughta sue.

Thought I should share this here first, before sending it off to the TML.

I\'ve assumed that Barbie? and her friends (sold separately) are 1/10 human
height, and thus occupy 1/1000 the volume.  All passenger space and
facilities were calculated at 1/500 normal scale, to allow for "breakaway"
components and access by the human owner.  Fusion Plus makes it all
possible.

Right now I\'m feeling a little queasy and ashamed, so I\'ll leave the
humorous writeup for the list(s) to wrangle out.

Well, one of the effects (we decided later) was that the atmosphere
code went from "Normal" to "Thin, tainted". The crater was rather
sizable. 

I basicly figured that given the "detonation" of the capacitors, there
was more than enough energy to turn the ship\'s LH2 supply into a fusion
bomb. And that led to the realization that the other ships were close
enough to do the same....

I\'ve wondered the same thing.  Just *how* did Dulinor get his pistol in
there, in the first place?  You\'d think no one would be allowed into the
audience chamber armed with a concealed weapon without big, bad armed
guards standing all around.  He must have compromised a *lot* of people for
the assassination to work the way it is described, and have the fleet
assets lined up like he had.  And out of all the people compromised nothing
was leaked to IISS? Hum?  

This *had* to be an IISS inside job! Dulinor was just the trigger man.

Oh, and what kind of pistol did he use?  If we are using T4 combat rules,
it must have been pretty BA to kill 4..or was it 5..people flat-out with
mostly single shots.  Now, if he was using autofire rules...;->

I might be wrong, but here\'s what I think was going on...

>What the Hell is Project Longbow?

It was an attempt by the Imperium to spy on what the Zhodani were up
to/afraid of toward the galactic core.  I think it was psionic in nature,
so it was able to get data at FTL speeds, something that had always been
impossible previously.

>Yes I know, it\'s a long-range communication project that was abandoned.

Not exactly abandoned..I don\'t think.  Either the assassination and
following rebellion shut it down, or what they discovered destroyed it, its
personnel, or convinced the powers that were to boogie out of there.

>Yet obviously Strephon uses it to contact... "an empress"?!?

I don\'t think Strephon "contacts the Empress", just learns that she/it is
coming. The progress of the "Empress Wave" across Zhodani space (at light
speed or less) is disrupting, if not totally destroying, Zhodani
civilization. How, we don\'t know.

>And who are Pentecost and the others? What\'s that thing who\'s coming? Any
>information in the supplements I didn\'t buy?

We never really found out what was coming, but it probably was the
destruction of Imperial society as they knew it. What was going to cause
it, how it was going to do it\'s damage, and what would have been left..or
replace imperial society we never found out.

Theories..everybody has theories, but only the insiders from GDW *knew*..or
maybe *they* didn\'t know, either. ;->

	BTW: Viewing the Wave with Longbow is imposible, if the the Pentecost
	message, that the wave has a 1C closure, is true. Because if the wave
	has 1C closure, effects of the wave would be seen by the longbow
	collectors only together with the arrival of the wave.

	In my private mail about my (un)canon shortbow in the Islands I
	handwaved that the speed of wave is imposibible to measure exactly.
	In my canon its about 1/4 to 1/8th of light speed, but whenever the
	wave rolls over a mass, e.g. a starsystem, the waves speed is measured
	as constant 1C. And about this fact is the Pentecost message about
	Gabriel, which was in my canon a far forward station in the Vargr
	extends to gather first hand experience about the wave.

	Now that I\'ve seen that LB/EW is still a theme of interest for the
	TML audience - my question to the round :

	What is in your opinion about the "real" speed of the wave ?

	- 1C, the wave was detected by accident. Call the placement of the
	  forward stations Herod&Raphael a bad timing. It was imposible to
	  view the wave with Longbow. It was only posible to view that
	  forward stations of Longbow II going offline when hit by the
	  wave.
	- Less than 1C, to be viewed with a longbow like system. The Pentacost
	  message was about research station, gathing "first hand" expirence
	  of how to stand the wave. Knowledge later used in the Avery/CABAL*.

	If the later is true, the JumpStart project had to be started
	after 1115, and therefore the only JumpStart caches will be
	found in Gushemege, where it was posible for the "real" Strephon
	to place them.

By Michael

	*Avery = Geeneered humanoid for high psionic capablilies, as about
		 45% are from Strephons DNA and 45% from Isolante Avery
		 could be considered as the Emperors legitime son.
	*CABAL = Computer Augumented Behavoir ALteration 
	         CABAL is canon in Tansa&Rure HIWG.

	As a funny side note in my canon.  It was first intended to send
	Avery with a Tl16+ high autonomous AI (somethink like the Kinunir)
	ship to ensure that he\'ll came back. Later a virus infected ship
	was cheaper, and the few Kinu\'s left are at least known to be as
	insane as most awaken. So it was easier to seach for an awaken
	less insane than a Kinu ;-)

	Placing a players group in this scenario would be of course more
	Paranoia than Traveller - " at first you\'ll have to sign here that
	you allow that a chip is impanted in you brain, to control you
	emotions and nerve system. They chip will be controled by this
	nice little vampire, just in case of something unusual happen.
	Lord Avery\'s YN15 has full confidence in the successfull completion
	of the mission " - you know the computer is your friend ;-)

	I prefer to use those enigmas as "side story", e.g. it could be
	posible if one in the group askes around for rumors in the local
	downtown bar, that he\'ll here a rumor about an enigma. To solve
	an enigma is imho "atshi keshi" (bad taste - in Go) Solving the
	Acients Enigma was imho a bad failure. In Go when you detect an
	atshi it should not be tasted, to taste it at the right time is
	good atshi, to smell the taste the remaining of the game is perfect
	atshi, to taste it to early or to let the smell evaporate is
	atshi keshi ;-)

My thinking was that it would encourage the writer to take the CPs (which cost 
IG nothing) rather than the money, as well as encouraging more people to write 
stuff.

I think it was established that it was a Dlani cultural norm to appear
before your lord armed.  The guards were rprobably used to the Archduke
wearing his pistol, and he and Strephon were such good friends...

Reminds me of the old joke about Generals and uniform regulations.. yes,
the are supposed to follow the rules, but who\'s going to tell a 4-star he\'s
out of uniform?

IIRC, he used a 10mm Magnum.  I\'ve actually played out this scenario in
playtesting ACQ.  Dulinor has complete surprise, and uses his Action Points
to improve his aim to get triple damage results on Strephon and Iolanthe,
the Aslan ambassador interrupts Dulinor and begins moving towards him, only
to be dropped by one of Dulinor\'s guards.  Dulinor then splatters the Grand
Princess.  (Damage 4 gun, triple damage result.  17 points of damage after
blowthrough, 17x3= 51 points of damage.  Ouch.)

Digest #9, page 20:

"The Scout Service Imperial Protection Detail has 12-person detachments on
continuous protective duty within sight of the Emperor at all times except
when he is in private chambers.  The detail\'s chief job is to prevent
assassination using their bodies if necessary.  Each memeber wears cloth
armor under plain civilian clothing and carries a concealed gauss pistol
and short range communicator.  Short barreled automatic gauss carbines
(gauss rifle -1 on the range table) are often carried concealed within
attache cases as well.  Small hand-launched anti-tank/anti-aircraft
missiles are also avalible to the protective detail."

Yeah, but they could have gotten the Heir to safety.  Along with taking

Ah.  The connection is obvious.  Surprised you folks haven\'t done this
topic to death by now.

Of course!  Barbie is Forever!

> What sort of theme sets and outfits does she have?

One for each Traveller char-gen career path...Imperial Navy Barbie comes
with a lovely IN uniform (cut slightly differently from regs), IISS Barbie
comes with whatever clothes they can slap together at the factory that day
plus Barbie\'s Startown Dream Dive playset, and so forth.

The Templars hold her image sacred, equating her with Sophia or Barbello (!)
of the Terran gnostics.  Barbie\'s ecstatic union with Ken dissolves all
existence into the Pleroma.  Or so it is claimed...

Unfortunately, due to a tragic confluence of military and business
factors, manufacturing rights for Barbie ended up with a Sylean
corporation (Zhunastu Enterprises) while those for Ken ended up in the Old
Earth Union (later Solomani Sphere).  Most of subsequent history in this
part of the galaxy consists of open and clandestine efforts to reunite
these two licenses under a single banner.

Nah, we\'ll do this for THUDDD 9.  Who needs a stupid lab ship when you can
have a tiny shocking-pink vinyl starship piloted by a girl with Bimbo-9?

That\'s quite obvious, although the imperial-corporate media machine doesn\'t
want you to know about it.  The Progressive Union of Sayat Spofulams is
advancing from its secret batcaves in the galactic core in order to enable
a radical transcendence of the primitive, crypto-feudal society of the
Third Imperium, depose the parasitic patriarchal pathetically-armed pigdog
Peerage, and liquidate the exploitative corporate classes whose tepid
commodity fetishism was once used as a pretext to impede our ancestors\'
technological self-actualization.

The so-called "Empress" is merely a typical Imperial obfuscation of Comrade
Spofulam THX1138, a psionic artillery spotter for the advancing fleets.
(If you can furnish proof that you are over 18 years of age, you may be
permitted to know what the "rod" she holds actually is.)

The long-oppressed populace of the former Zhodani Consulate are joyously
throwing off the yoke of their turbaned exploiters and joining in the
struggle against the reactionary interstellar aristo-syndicalist cliques.
Most members of the previously co-opted psionic janissary caste now
understand the genuine socio-historical conditions and form a valued part
of the popular movement.

(Rumors that the Vargr have been suborned with advanced milkbone technology
and antimatter-powered neuro-mechanical implants which scratch behind their
ears _just right_ are (all too obviously) transparent, desperate lies of
the cash-driven, big-money-owned imperial propaganda agencies.)

While dismantling the bloated carcass of the Imperium\'s power structures,
military agitators and cultural laborers will continue to bring the next
stage of sentient evolution to the bandit fiefdoms of the Aslan warlords
and the fascist prison-state of the Solomani Sphere, and begin dialectical
incorporation of the relatively advanced Hiver Federation.  The
Spofulam-Sayat Front has plans for a celebratory barbeque to be held
throughout liberated space, of which the K\'kree shall be primary
components.

PUSS further wishes to congratulate Virus for boldly striking the first
blow in the struggle against interstellar imperialism, while sadly
acknowledging certain excesses of revolutionary fervor on the part of our
"silicomrades".

>Theories..everybody has theories, but only the insiders from GDW *knew*..or
>maybe *they* didn\'t know, either. ;->

No matter how wrong and stupid the Virus may have been, the whole TNE thing
is made worthwhile to my mind by the Empress Wave element.  I\'d pay hefty
sums of dollars for a final TNE sourcebook explaining what [would have]
happened next.  Whereas it would take a lot of cash to pay me just to own

Bloody hell!
That must be the most violent/gory film I\'ve ever seen! How the hell 
that got through with only a 15 certificate I\'ll never know.
Do the military\'s tactics make the Charge of the Light Brigade look 
like a carefully thought-out surgical strike? Absolutely.
Is it a Nazi recruiting film? No, it\'s pretty obvious we\'re not 
supposed to approve of the Fascist society.
Is it pro-war? Definitely not. War is hell.
Is it made in the style of a WW2 war movie with nice touches of black 
humour and some of the best FX you\'ve ever seen? Yup.

The Kessel Run, is described in great detail in A.C. Crispin\'s book _The Hutt
Gambit_.  In addition to the black holes mentioned above, the ship had to traverse
yet another unrealistically dense asteroid field just the other side of those
black holes.  According to the book, it was (somehow) faster to go through
the space occupied by the black holes, and the asteroid field than it was to
plot hyperspace  jumps around it.

I don\'t recommend reading Star Wars books for their technical content, it\'s all
very vague.

The thought of making actual Travellerized Barbies has surfaced on
TravLang... including, ideally, one in authentic Vilani costume with a
speech chip to teach Vilani pronunciation and useful phrases.  (That\'ll
show those lame-o Klingon poofters!)

If Barbie is now manufactured by Zhunastu Enterprises, is her product line
geared towards promoting the Sylean noble lifestyle as the "high culture"
of the new Imperium?  Training all those little girls to think that the
Imperial aristcracy are just, totally, like, the BEST! ?

I hesitate to ask -- but only briefly: what\'s the esoteric significance of
Barbie and Ken being non-anatomically correct (between the legs, I mean)?

(Mr. Erickson, I beg you to keep your absolutely disgusting suggestions to
yourself!)

The Third Imperium\'s geniune purpose in foundation, then, is to find the
missing Groom?

Yes, to heck with all that "alchemical wedding" claptrap.  Bring on the
nanotech nuptials!

Monitors anyone? Collect some nickel/iron rocks, about 3-5 kilometers across
and pepper the surfaces with these things. Bury the power plants deep in the
nickel/iron bodies and place them in stable orbits about a planet, or at
trojan points. Great for keeping people out OR IN.

I spent the afternoon playing with FFS\'s PAW design sequences, and produced
several NPAW\'s.  I\'ve posted some of the stats for two of them below,
please look at them and tell me if they look right.  

==============================================================
NPAW-40 

For use on small warships like Corvettes, SDB\'s and Destroyer Escorts.

TL 12  Tunnel Length=40m  Diameter=5m  DE=800Mj  CM=1.0

Effective Range = 187,500km   

Damage Values under different assumptions:

1.  TNE type system
        a.  Beam Pointer 180,000 (6x30,000)km
        
        b.  SR = BP then double for each additional range

    DV = 6:147 12:74 24:37 48:18     (USP: 4/2/1/0)

2.  T4/TNE hybrid system 
        a.  Beam Pointer 180,000 (6x30,000)km
        
        b.  Fixed Ranges 1/5/10/20/40 hexes (max DV at BP)
        
    DV = 1:147 5:147 10:88 20:44 40:22  (USP: 4/4/3/2/1)
    
3.  T4 system (I don\'t really know how to rate them here)
        a.  Beam Pointer 50,000km
        
        b.  Range Bands: Planetary (50,000), Far Orbit (500,000)
        
    DV = Planetary:530 Far Orbit:53 <---- these don\'t look right to me

==============================================================
NPAW-100 

For use on medium warships, like Frigates, Destroyers and Light Cruisers.
     
TL 12  Tunnel Length=100m  Diameter=12.5m  DE=5,000Mj  CM=1.0

Effective Range = 2,929,688km   

Damage Values under different assumptions:

1.  TNE type system
        a.  Beam Pointer 300,000 (10x30,000)km
        
        b.  SR = BP then double for each additional range

    DV = 10:3,453 20:1,726 40:863 80:432 <--these can\'t be right!
    
                                    (USP: 17/14/11/9)
                                    
2.  T4/TNE hybrid system 
        a.  Beam Pointer 300,000 (6x30,000)km
        
        b.  Fixed Ranges 1/5/10/20/40 hexes (max DV at BP)
        
    DV = 1:3453 5:3553 10:3453 20:1726 40:863  (USP: 17/17/17/14/11)
    
3.  T4 system (I don\'t really know how to rate them here)
        a.  Beam Pointer 500,000km
        
        b.  Range Bands: Planetary (50,000), Far Orbit (500,000)
        
    DV = Planetary:20716 Far Orbit:2072 <--these can\'t be right!
==============================================================

Is the MAXIMUM DV based on the damage that would be done at Actual
Effective Range, and DV at any shorter range can\'t exceed that DV?  

If that\'s the case then the revised numbers for the two PAWs would be:

NPAW-40
    TNE.DV       6:141 12:74 24:37 48:18
    
    TNE.Fixed DV 1:141 5:141 10:88 20:44 40:22
    
    T4.DV Planetary:141 Far Orbit:53 
    
NPAW-100    
    All DV = 354 at all listed ranges
        
This makes more sense to me, but imposing this sort of limit is not in FFS
anywhere that I can find.

	Jep its an "event horizon" send a NPC ship there, and it will
	certainly NOT come back, send a player character ship and the
	stakes rise to imposible that the ship will come back.

	During the hard times the different areas evolved. Most systems
	in the wilds, outlands and even frontier had been back to Tl9-
	before virus arived. Only the save areas had maintained their
	status quo. So only the former save areas now show significant
	virus population. Core is even more extreme. First it was the
	largest save area, and second there is a permanent war between
	the Puppetiers with a steady feed of stupid Prophets and more
	stupid Doomslayers visiting the area. As the war now lasts for
	more than 70 years, I would also asume that some shipyards are
	continuing Lucans production, perhaps its even likely that some
	Naval Bases are still functional. Virus was intended to suicide,
	but the code was not stable. Between 079-1130 and 243-1130 the
	code switched to the slayer type in most infects - Dulinor had
	the historical oportunity to gather a first hand experience of
	that evolution - later the higher strains showed to be more
	successfull, but in core with permanent war only Puppetiers
	can survive. A lonly Parent or Peacemaker, will become slayed
	in the Ghulag, and anything below a Puppetier will become
	reinfected to fight for one of the sides.

"When your message must get through"

Do pirates ignore your requests to "Please Leave"?
Are you concerned by your SDB\'s having a response time of over
1 hour to help?

Then what you need is an array of Telstar XII Communications
Satellites orbitting your world.

The Telstar XII can send a message of your choice out to 100
diameters of a Size A planet in only 3 seconds.

The sensor array, combined with a 500,000km beam pointer ensures that
the message will be directed accurately at your recipient - there
is no need to worry that it will be misdirected to a third party.

To ensure that the message arrives in the same condition that it
leaves, we have used a 6.3m diameter focal array which, with
gravitational assistance, ensures no dispersion in the first
1,000,000km.

Since pirates can be very lax about listening out for messages, ours
is encoded using 10 coaxial lasing elements, of 400MJ each. So you
can ensure that the message will reach the pirate captain, no mater
what stands in the way (even several decks).

In case they don\'t get your message the first time, it\'s repeated
every 2.25 seconds.

"Telstar XII - One day all planets will be protected this way" :)

*******************************************************************
Notes:
Thanks to Andy Atkins for his excellent spreadsheet.

The food supply is 16 weeks. You could have a cheaper satelite
without the manoeuvre, but this satelite can land on the planet
for resupply without the planet having to have a high tech or decent
starport.

There is a 230MW power shortfall, but this doesn\'t matter because
the Telstar XII is supposed to remain in orbit and not use its contra
grav whilst operating.

The main problem with this design is surface area - even with a thin
disc design. All you really need is Fusion+ for the "Laser Comms",
since you don\'t use it all the time. It also limits the amount of
contra-grav.

Using Fusion and Thrusters account for almost half the total cost.

I don\'t know if 800 ROF is really needed, but it does improve the 
factor:)

A solution to the power problem is being considered by the
Emerging Products Division
"Microwaving half baked ideas from across the Imperium".

At TL 13, a non grav focused X-ray laser only needs to be 10m in
diameter to reach 1,000,000km, but with only a third the power
so the satelite cost is halved.

On the other hand, a grav focused X-ray laser with a 7 m focal
diameter will have an effective range of over 780 million km
(ie from the Sun to Jupiter) - If you could just build a big enough
beam pointer...

I have an inquiry regarding the aforementioned Rodent Liquifaction
Instrument. What is the maximum size of rodent this device is capable of
rendering? Our specimens are of, shall we say, Unusual Size. If its
capabilities meet our needs, we might well be interested in ordering two or
more for our BioResearch Unit.

Your attention is most appreciated.

Most civilian ships require about 1 hour to generate this and don\'t have
the power to generate it any quicker.

Note that FFS (p12) implies that once the power is stored, you can\'t hang
around and wait (since there is a one hour time limit), so the ship
must jump.

ie, once the jump cycle starts, you can predict within a few thousand km
where the ship will be when it jumps (and when).

Just aborting the jump cycle has problems, because all that energy is
going to melt something if you don\'t use it to enter jumpspace.

ROF is one shot ever 36 seconds, so we need to deliver 140 watts of energy
per second for 36 seconds.

10 grams of TL10 36 seconds output battery delivers 375 watts per second

Elan (2302) Mina (2401) and Solarda (2403) are Virus-controlled states and satellites of the Black
Curtain. Elan and Solarda, in addition to salvage sites for Vampire ships in service to the fleets of
the Curtain, are also exporters of shipbound human slaves. The inhabitants of Mina have
successfully fled into the underground and have, to date, avoided such terrible fates.

That\'s quite obvious, although the imperial-corporate media machine doesn\'t
want you to know about it.  That\'s why the TML server suppressed this
message the first time I sent it.  The Progressive Union of Sayat Spofulams
is advancing from its secret batcaves in the galactic core in order to
enable a radical transcendence of the primitive, crypto-feudal society of
the Third Imperium, depose the parasitic patriarchal pathetically-armed
pigdog Peerage, and liquidate the exploitative corporate classes whose
tepid commodity fetishism was once used as a pretext to impede the
P.U.S.S.\'s ancestors\' technological self-actualization.

The so-called "Empress" is merely a typical Imperial obfuscation of Comrade
Spofulam THX1138, a psionic artillery spotter for the advancing fleets.
(If you can furnish proof that you are over 18 years of age, you may be
permitted to know what the "rod" she holds actually is.)

The long-oppressed populace of the former Zhodani Consulate are joyously
throwing off the yoke of their turbaned exploiters and joining in the
struggle against the reactionary interstellar aristo-syndicalist cliques.
Most members of the previously co-opted psionic janissary caste now
understand the genuine socio-historical conditions and form a valued part
of the popular movement.

(Rumors that the Vargr have been suborned with advanced milkbone technology
and antimatter-powered neuro-mechanical implants which scratch behind their
ears _just right_ are (all too obviously) transparent, desperate lies of
the cash-driven, big-money-owned imperial propaganda agencies.)

While dismantling the bloated carcass of the Imperium\'s power structures,
military agitators and cultural laborers will continue to bring the next
stage of sentient evolution to the bandit fiefdoms of the Aslan warlords
and the fascist prison-state of the Solomani Sphere, and begin dialectical
incorporation of the relatively advanced Hiver Federation.  The
Spofulam-Sayat Front has plans for a celebratory barbeque to be held
throughout liberated space, of which the K\'kree shall be primary
components.

PUSS further wishes to congratulate Virus for boldly striking the first
blow in the struggle against interstellar imperialism, while sadly
acknowledging certain excesses of revolutionary fervor on the part of our
"silicomrades".

>Theories..everybody has theories, but only the insiders from GDW *knew*..or

No matter how wrong and stupid the Virus may have been, the whole TNE thing
is made worthwhile to my mind by the Empress Wave element.  I\'d pay hefty
sums of dollars for a final TNE sourcebook explaining what [would have]
happened next.  Whereas it would take a lot of cash to pay me just to own
_First Survey_.

Another question from the newbie...

In TNE Path of Tears sourcebook is described the entire RC fleet, but there
are several desings I\'m unfamiliar with. Could someone give me at least the
tonnage of the Valor-class Corvette, the Petty-class Merchant, the Vixtrix,
the Fusilier-class destroyers and Leviathan-class assault transport?

I\'m not going to suggest anything. I will point out that you might want
to consider the Skopty sect in Russia (and other, similar movements) as

Who says it was *concealed*? 

In a semi-feudal society, bearing weapons in the presence of a superior
noble is a "perq". And pistols might actually be *part* of the
"uniform" so as to *show* that one is so trusted and honored.

Remember, this is *not* current "Western" culture. The rules *are*
different. 

> He must have compromised a *lot* of people for the assassination to

> IISS? Hum?

Again, due to the way bond and obligations run in a fuedal
society/structure, there may have been little *need* to compromise
people. 

Two often overlooked features of many fuedal societies:

1. People in fealty to you are *not* necessarily in fealty to the
   people you are in fealty to. That is, if you are a sworn vassal of
   X, *your* sworn vassals owe him no service, nor does he owe them
   anything. You can order your vassals to do things for him and to
   follow orders from him, but they remain *your* men.

2. fuedal obligations/duties cut both ways. You may owe services to X,
   but *he* owes protection and support to you. If he fails in his
   duties to you, you are free of your oathes and obligations.

So it\'s quite possible that Dulinor merely looked for folks who felt
that Strephon wasn\'t living up to his end of the bargain. In that case,
the only thing they did "wrong" was to fail to publicly proclaim the
breach before acting against him.

> This *had* to be an IISS inside job! Dulinor was just the trigger man.

Or Strephon just misjudged how far he could push things without vassals
deciding he\'d forsworn himself.

There are decided *advantages* to a society based on vassalage (for
one, you in effect have a *contract* with your "lord" stating what you
owe him and what he owes you. None of this faceless bureaucrats
deciding if you deserve something or if you should or shouldn\'t do
something) 

But as pointed out above, it can have it\'s problems as well.

Even if Imperial society isn\'t all that "feudal", I think it\'d be great
letting players run into a planet that *was* run that way. Large chunks
of "law" as we see it, wind up as part of the "contract". So just
because you see someone doing something in public doesn\'t mean that
*you* can. :-)

IIRC he didn\'t conceal it. It was an honour weapon - part of his dress and

Precisely!  Barbie is yet another weapon in the semiotic war being waged
by the Imperium against proponents of less hierarchically ossified models
of government.  She is the Fusion+ of the memosphere, indoctrinating
innocent children into the cult of aristocracy under their parents\' very
noses and with their unknowing complicity.  Fiendish indeed... 

Needless to say, this is a deep and twisted perversion of Barbie\'s true
purpose as understood by the Templars and the (deeply hidden) Arcadian
Gnostic sects scattered throughout human space.  In point of fact, the
Templars and the Gnostics also have rather differing opinions on her
purpose, which partly accounts for the Templars\' failure to smite down
Cleon I for sullying Barbie\'s holiness with commercial and imperialistic
schemes. (Another reason is that the Templars well understand the ancient
philosophical principle "there\'s no such thing as bad publicity.")

Ah, a penetrating question.  [cue rim-shot] As you no doubt are aware, the
Gnostics (and their descendant sects, such as the Albigensians, Cathars,
et al) believe the material world to be a creation of the Demiurge, an
evil, egotistical, self-absorbed demon masquerading as the One God.  As
such, sexual procreation is intrinsically wrong, as it merely results in
more souls being mired in this evil world of matter.  When Barbie and Ken
ecstatically unite, their union is not one of flesh, but of Pneuma.  The
dolls faithfully record this esoteric doctrine. 

Again, the Templars feel rather differently about this issue, but Gnostics
controlled the doll industry on late pre-stellar Terra.  Such are the
vagaries of occult history.

One of the pleasures of having a four-and-a-half year old niece is
buying toys for her.  Before Christmas, my wife and I were in the local
megasized Toys-Ya-Us and found a Barbie outfit (one of those cards with
only clothes on it, but no doll) that consisted of a khaki jacket, hat,
shorts and other various safari gear.  It stuck me at once - add an IISS
starburst and you would have \'Scout Service Barbie.\'

Hmm..The Toys-Ya-Us is on the way home..

(Besides, my niece is a good kid - she went to GenCon when she was two
and got her own dice there.)

Actually, I want \'Vargr Captive Barbie\' and \'VaccSuit Ken\'.

Be very afraid.  We have costumer friends who do strange things to Barbie
dolls (the photos of "Barbie\'s House of Lesbian Leather" are a scream.)

Last year, they brought "Barbi-yon 5" dolls to BayCon.  Barbie dolls
dressed as characters from B5.. the Kosh doll even had a sound chip!

I will inform them of this thread, and start plotting.  I may have them
ready by GenCon.

Just in case anyone want to follow this up (or otherwise), I just happen to

have recently read the book in question:

Jedi Search by Kevin Anderson (Part 1 of the Jedi Academy Trilogy)

I quite liked it as a bit of handwaving (but then I appear to be one of the
 few who could be [just about] persuaded by the M0 Campaign\'s
 rationale on law level in the data), however Mr Hale is quite right, as I
understood it, *originally* it was just an error.

If it does, it would have been villified when it was published because such

Actually Barbie, along with other 11 1/2" fashion dolls and 12" poseable

4 cm long and your calling this a rifle?  The barrel on my 12" fully
poseable Princess Leia figure\'s blaster is about 7 cm with a barrel length
of about 5 cm.

I think it fairly obvious, that despite having achieve a mastery of FF&S

    'body' => 'I\'m looking at the old Mayday game (with an eye of updating the system to
T4), and I\'ve come across some inconsistancies that I\'d like to run by the
group to see if I\'m making some large error in my thinking...

The game uses a time scale of 1 turn = 100 min = 6000 sec, and a hex scale
of 1 light sec = 3.0 x 10^8 m. They allow each G (=approx. 10 m/s^2) of
accelleration to alter the future position of the ship 1 hex. However,
going back to the old physics books, delta x = (1/2)at^2 going solely on
accelleration. Plugging in the numbers gives delta x for 1G =1.8 x 10^8, or
roughly half of what\'s needed.

Now if we change the time to reflect current T4 starship combat turns,
things get even worse. Change your hex scale to 1/10th of a light second
(the minimum range for any weapon in Starships) and the time scale to 10
min = 600 sec (the Standard T4 starship combat turn). Plugging in the
numbers at this scale gives a delta x for 1G = 1.8 x 10^6, compared to a
3.0 x 10^7 m hex; only 1/20th of what\'s needed.

Now the rub... Something needs to change fairly drastically to bring things
back into the realm of playability, either:
a) turn length (approx. 40 min. turns gives a delta x = 1 hex = 3.0 x
10^7), allowing a ship to fire multiple times per movement (4 to be exact).
b) hex scale (approx. 1/200th of a light sec, which allows for some wasted
energy), but would necessitate some sort of compensation for scale at long
ranges, because at this scale for a hex, long ranged weapons span a
whopping 1600 hexes (which I really doubt anyone has the space for on their
dining room table). Two possibilities here:
	1) use a duel scale system similar to Starfire by TFG
	2) keep track of initial ranges and closure on paper, allowing for
firing each turn, and only putting things on the map when they get to a
"reasonable" distance.

Personally I\'m for option (A), but I\'m not sure how to work out the firing
problem, particularly with missile volleys, as one turn\'s missile fire
effectively quadruples the incoming swarm. Potentially this could be solved
by having an "A, B, C, & D" firing phase in each turn, so missiles fired in
phase B won\'t arrive at the target ship until phase B of the turn that they
enter the ship\'s hex, allowing point defense to fire at each phase\'s
incoming nasties.

So the real question is which do YOU prefer.

If you\'re only voting, you can send me private email (there\'s no need to
clutter up the TML with that), but if you\'ve found some horrid error in my
logic, please allow me to look the fool in front of everyone. ;-)

Does that mean that the next item of purchase would be some kind of Barbie
doll instead of another RPG supplement ?

What is the core product of the Barbie line ?

What supplements are recommended for beginners ?

They will be vulnerable to Meson Guns and nukes, but not a lot else.

Mind you, it\'ll be a shock if they run into a meson gun ship with enough
range and agility to stay out of trouble from the PAWs.

The way I read it, this PAW will punch AV 147 at the lesser range of it\'s
short range or effective range, then falls is effective output according to
(range/effective range)^2.
Pump effective output into the normal 2.5 * (effective output)^0.5 formula.

I read a 5000 megajoule weapon as doing DV 350, falling off as you go
beyond the design range.

Armour isnt thick enough ... the Pirates could get stroppy, and try to
interrupt the conversation, as it were.

With 0.5 gees, the Telstar cant get out of the way awfully well.

I really, really dislike this aspect of Traveller combat. If a hit from a
400 MJ laser doesnt get thru the armour, then twenty hits from a 400 MJ
laser wont, either.

Good stuff in short :) I *like* the design :)

Sorry but the info that I have is a bit different:

The Star Trek Pilot ("The Cage") cost $630,000
(source "The Star Trek Compendium")
or $686,000 (source "Star Trek Movie Memories").

The Dr Who Pilot cost =A32,143(episode 1); =A34,307; =A32,181 and =A32,316.
Plus =A34,328 for the Tardis interior sets.
(Source "The Handbook - The First Doctor")

Indeed I seem to recall calculating that, allowing for exchange rates,
the first three years of Dr Who (126 episodes) cost less than the
Star Trek pilot.

I also recall reading somewhere that the per episode cost of Battlestar
Galatica was >$1million due to the cost of the effects.

Not sure. I suspect that it would only take a minor tweak to Accrete to
"fix" it. 

As I understand it, the most popular theory to explain those gas giants
is that they formed farther out, and friction in the nebula drew them
inward.

It even kinda makes sense. I suspect that Accrete can\'t produce close
binaries either.

Longbow\'s task wasn\'t to observe the wave (which propagated at the speed of
light).  Rather, its task was to observe Zhodani ship "movement" along the
core expedition route.

Actually, what I\'ve read is that Lucas knew darn well that it was an
error, and put it in with the intent of showing that Han wasn\'t as
bright as he thought he was. Alas, it didn\'t occur to him that anybody
who knew what a parsec was *wouldn\'t* believe that a pilot could be

  For those of you with the MegaTraveller Rebellion Sourcebook, the
Valor is the little fellow at the bottom of the picture on page 20,
and two more are to be found escorting the Voroshilef on page 82. The
class originally appeared in the FASA supplement "Adventure Class Ships,
Volume 1", a Classic Trav deckplan collection.

 The Victrix is described in the TNE adventure "The Guilded Lilly,"
one of the last publications of GDW. It is a 400-ton starship originally
of Solomani design adapted and adopted by the RC.

  The Petty sounds like the TL-12 version of the Fat Trader (aka
Type-R).

  The Fusilier is an Aurora Clipper that has had all of its modular
space filled in with a streamlined solid hull (at least as far as
general hull shape is concerned). Based on the numbers for the Clipper
I would place the Fusilier at about 2100 tons displacement.

  The Leviathan is said to carry a "Light Brigade" but no size is
given beyond this clue. It either looks completely different from
the other ships of the RC, OR it looks like the Fusilier...

You\'ll have to special order from the US or find it second hand (unless
they re-release it to coincide with the movie) to get a copy in the UK.
Like most of RH\'s stuff, it\'s out of print in the UK.

I ordered it and read it the day before we went to see the preview. Once I
managed to disconnect the memories of the book, the film was okay (if you
ignore the obvious stupidities like not nuking the Bug\'s homeworld).

Hi guys - I\'ve just discovered TML and maybe you can help me with a query?

Has anyone seen the Deluxe T4 book yet? I have the previous T4 rulebook but
would upgrade if the new one has enough of the bugs fixed (weapons,
character generation, QSDS etc). So, what\'s new?

If you check your textbooks, what you find is:

If your current vector is 3 hexes per turn in direction 1
If the acceleration is by 2 hexes in direction 2
Your final vector is 3 hexes in direction 1 plus 2 in direction 2.
However, on the turn you apply the acceleration, you only get half of the
distance.
(assuming uniform acceleration, at the start of the turn you had no
direction 2 vector,
at the end you have a 2 hex vector, so you actually moved 1 hex in
direction 2)

Mayday\'s approximation gives the correct vector (which is the basis for
future movement)
but a slightly wrong position.

Presumably this is because you would need twice as many hexes otherwise (a
1G thrust
changes your vector by 2 hexes but your position by only 1 on the turn it
is applied).
It also helps explain the game when delta-X is the same as your velocity
vector.

Since at the Traveller ranges there is no dogfighting as such, if you only
have
two ships (eg PC plus pirate) a simple linear scale will do (ie are they
closing
or separating).

To make a game you must be thinking of multiple ships and then I would favour
a set of firepower stats to reflect combat ability over the entire 6000sec.
This would be a bit more "Battle Rider" than "Mayday" but a "Battle Rider" for
smaller ships.

Don\'t forget that a triple laser turret can fire 2,400 shots per turn (or
24,000
in your extended period) and that\'s either a lot of dice or you are already
using
a more abstract damage system.

All IMHO of course:)

The Killer Bee class Light Fighter is designed to engage and destroy
enemy
warships. It can also serve in a planetary air support role. It is
capable 
of operating from carriers, space stations and planetary surfaces.

The primary offensive capability of the Killer Bee is the three standard
half ton displacement anti-ship missiles. A Master Fire Director is 
provided to allow greater accuracy and control of the missiles. The
short 
range fixed laser is operated by the pilot aiming the ship at the target

and firing. It is also equipped with a Master Fire Director. The
missiles 
can be replaced with deadfall ordinance or a variety of smaller tactical

missiles.

The Killer Bee has relatively light armor for space combat which is 
supplemented by electro static armor, doubling the effective protection
for
the ship. It has basic drive and neutrino masking, limited stealth in
the
form of an EMS absorbing hull, plus military black coatings.

The Killer Bee is intended for relatively short duration missions.
However,
it is capable of operating independently for up to 7 days and has a
fresher,
but no bunk, for the comfort of the crew during extended operations.

The Killer Bee Commander variant of the Killer Bee has a second crew
station
for the flight commander and an additional 7 1000AU Laser communicators
(making a total of 8). To make room for the commander one of the missile
canisters has been removed. The reduced mass of the Commander increases
the
performance to 4.3 G\'s in space operations. Otherwise, the Killer Bee 
Commander is identical to the standard Killer Bee.

The Deluxe T4, AKA T4.1 is still being worked on by Marc. He\'s released
bits and pieces for comment, such as chargen rules, task systems, and some
other stuff which escapes me now. It would be in the archives though, at
mpgn. I think it was posted last fall.

He\'s stated that he wants it done right, and is willing to slip release
dates in favor of achieving that aim. (Yaaay!)

By CT rules a ship can\'t jump at all unless it is able to generate the

Not a bad point. It\'s true that a merchant can\'t always jump away from a
pirate; if he is surprised, he is in trouble. However, I still don\'t
understand how the pirate achived the surprise in the first place. In
space there is nowhere to hide. The best suggestion I\'ve seen so far
is for the pirate to linger in port until his prospective prey takes
off and then file a flight plan that allows him to take off almost
immidiately afterwards on the same vector. There\'s only two things
wrong with that: First of all I don\'t believe that a ship can set down
on a manned starport without leaving sufficient evidence behind to
identify it afterwards. And secondly I don\'t see how anyone can behave
like that without arousing deep suspicions in with prey and authorities.
The very fact that such behaviour is the only practical way to get a
shot at a victim will make it so very suspicious.

Granted the old CT system was elegant in its simplicity, but then again the
QSDS is also pretty basic (if not quite as elegant or broad in scope). I\'m
not sure that anythng would be gained by generating a new system, as ship
cards would still have to be generated for T4 use.

What might be a better option, is to revamp the QSDS slightly to make it
feel more like designing with the older system (i.e. easier, more "plug &
play" systems, and a broader range of options). Personnally, I find the
hull table of the QSDS to be very restrictive, which is a problem that
never came up in CT.

SSDS and FFS2 give the flexiblity needed at the cost of some complexity,
but the Herr Andy\'s spreadsheets take much of the sting out of it. I\'m kind
of a tech-head, so I kind of like the current systems, but I do see the
allure of the old ways (particularly when I can\'t get the bottom line to
come out right!).

There actually was a prediction (by Doug Lin at UCSC) that forming giant
planets would tend to spiral in due to tidal forces (not friction). 
It didn\'t get a lot of attention because the major problem is stopping the
planets; to first order they just end up falling into the star. One needs a
"just so" tweaking of the parameters to make the accretion disk go away just
as the planet almost-but-not-quite reaches the star, or some ad hoc assumptions
about rotation and magnetic fields to clear a gap inside the disk. Adding it
correctly to a program like accrete would be hard. 

The second-most-popular theory is that multiple planets form and chaotic 
interactions between them eject a couple while moving another one into a 
very close orbit. This also has problems - it takes considerable effort to
re-circularize the orbit, and again it\'s pretty "just so"...

My understanding is also that, in part, Lucas was trying to stress that 
this was "a Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far Far Away", and the same rules 
didn\'t necessarily apply (*He* knew damn well he was writing a Mythic 
Fantasy that happened to use SF props, even if some folks keep trying to

   Ah, but how about subsequent episodes of Star Trek?  I\'m not disputing
your numbers by any means, I\'m just wondering how much it cost once all the
sets were constructed (usually the highest cost item for doing such a series).

>I also recall reading somewhere that the per episode cost of Battlestar
>Galatica was $1million due to the cost of the effects.

   That number is correct, or at least pretty close, and I\'m not even sure
if that included cast salaries.  It was definately a factor in the ABC
network deciding to cancel the series (despite its Star Trek-like "hardcore
following").  It also explains why the emphasis of "Galactica: 1980" was on
the contact mission with Earth and not on the Colonials fending off hordes
of Cylon Raiders.

I\'m actually looking for NPC\'s to use in my own campaign so I hope people

in the spinward marches and seeking the emancipation of psionicists through
the overthrow of the Imperium in this region and the the transfer of power
of the marches over to the Zhos.

The high ups, the intermediaries and the foot soldiers of this organisation

It\'s a bit silly to think that you will not have an hour or more warning if
a ship is "bearing down" on you.  Short of some ruse to prevent their prey
from leaving, merchants will have a tremendous (relatively) amount of time
to make the jump/no jump decision.

Hmmm, haven\'t seen this, but the implication behind black globe shields
which have been around in every incarnation of traveller is that energy can
be "stored" in a "capacitor" and be ready to use for jump energy.  Now, it
could be that the energy stored needs an hour to convert *after* that
point...even so, if I *knew* the approaching ship had hostile intent (not
always possible I know) then committing to a jump an hour before weapons
range would not be a problem

>ie, once the jump cycle starts, you can predict within a few thousand km
>where the ship will be when it jumps (and when).

I don\'t see how that follows.  My recollection is that jump destination is
affected by gravity, velocity, and direction of travel.  Fleets of ships
jumping together can coordinate such that they arrive at *approximately*
the same time and space, but that is not the same as observing a ship jump
*then* basing your own jump factors on intercepting them.  In fact, I would
say this is non-canonical.

>Just aborting the jump cycle has problems, because all that energy is
>going to melt something if you don\'t use it to enter jumpspace.

Again, the jump capacitor thing contradicts this, but certainly if such
capacitors do not exist the energy must go somewhere; and recent
discussions showed that radiating energy into space has serious limits.

I\'m not sure I buy this one, either.  I have (somewhere) a first printing of
the novelization of Star Wars (also by Lucas - remember, he was producer,
director, screenwriter, and wrote the novelization).  In the novelization,
Han says "standard timeparts" instead of "parsec".

My guess is that Lucas wrote "standard timeparts" into the script, but when
they were shooting it, it didn\'t sound right coming out of Harrison Ford\'s
mouth.  So it got changed (on the spot, probably) to the first thing that
Lucas could think of that sounded better.  Thus "parsec", which sounds
vaguely technical and time-like.

Seems to me a reasonable outline.

A couple questions, to Marc and the list in general:

1. Is Wildstar still working on QSDS v2, or has this become vapourware?
;-)

2. If 1. is true, will this be considered as the new ship design system
to be included in T4.1?

3. Has anyone been using the RPSCS (Role-playing ship combat system), or
done any other work on it? (latest version I\'ve seen is 0.9)

4. Will the RPSCS be considered as the basis of the new ship combat
system?


My hopes:

I think QSDS is an admirably quick and simple way to build a starship,
if QSDS2 is updated for compatibility with FF&S2 and the combat system;
and if easy to follow flowcharts/checklists are included, I think it
would serve quite well as the design system.

I\'d hate to see yet another design system that isn\'t a direct decendant
of or compatible with any other previously published system.

The RPSCS seems just the ticket for a combat system. I haven\'t
playtested it yet, but it seems to me that having *role-play* as the
focus (as opposed to wargaming, ala BL & BR) is a good premise for the
basic rulebook.

The presentation of RPSCS could be tweaked a bit, with the addition of a
clear flowchart, checklist, turn sequence or whatever you\'d like to call
it.

I *definitely* would like to keep the basis for combat being
detect-lock-fire, _please_ don\'t water it down to just a basic "to hit"
task roll. Don\'t skip the important considerations of detection with
active/passive sensors, keeping a fire control lock on target, *then*
firing.

Combat is much more suspenseful and realistic with the additional step
of tracking the target down, evasion, sensor jamming, spoofing, worrying
about "lighting up" the active sensors, powering down equipment to
reduce signature, and all the other fun stuff. :)

Re: Robert Eaglestone\'s request for a more CT like system

I don\'t see QSDS as being *that* much more different or difficult than
the CT version. They both have modular components, and require only
basic math.

I do not want to see yet-another-starship-design-system. What\'s wrong
with a modified QSDS? What makes the CT system so much better? If QSDS
had a wider selection of hulls, and if it included a wider selection of
standard components, it would serve admirably.

The foundation is there, let\'s use it. Don\'t go back to a 20 year old
system which has different basic assumptions. I like the more realistic
assumptions (detect-lock-fire) for reasons outlined above.

There\'s a reprint out to coincide with the movie.  I saw it the other day
in a K-Mart magazine rack.  The cover is a picture from the movie.  Don\'t
remember the publisher info, etc or know if it\'s available outside of
North America.

My name is Frank Frey and I\'m an old time Traveller player (ca. 1977). My
main area of interest is the First Interstellar War and the period leading
up to it. I\'ve already posted some material on WEBRPG\'s Traveller forum.
(www.webrpg.com)
As a history major, one of the things that really interests me is the
impact that intial contact with the Vilani had upon the Terrans. Talk
about shaking things up!! Another topic is how and why the FIW got started
in the first place. When you look at the map of the Solomani Rim the first
thing that jumps out is that there was plenty of room for the Terrans to
expand rimward. Since it was a Terran warship that fired first on a Vilani
trade convoy, one can only draw the conclusion that it was a deliberate
provocation and casus belli. Why this occured is open to speculation.
Shall we speculate?

Ordering from the US is no problem, but I thought I read somewhere that it 
had been re-issued. I\'ll check.

Not quite as dumb as sending in infantry with no heavy weapons, no AFVs, and 
no air support.

According to the DW figures, permanent sets cost 2/3 of the cost. Excluding 
these, DW episodes cost roughly the same as the pilot, so assume ST is the same. 
This gives ST= ~$210k/ep, DW= ~£2.3k. Not sure what the exchange rate was, say 
$3/£, giving DW= ~$7k/ep, or 1/30 of the budget of ST.

Normally, the budgets for BBC SF series are the same as for drama series.

I think it is safe to say that not all ships have the capacitors of the 
size needed to hold jump energy.  And I remember that if you overload a 
Black Globe, then the stored energy will be released with complete 
destruction of the ship.

This right here is all a matter of semantics, nothing more.  I don\'t think
when people talk about the artwork in a role-playing game, they really mean
stuff that should be hanging in a museum...

Not entirely true, at least not in the illustration classes that I\'ve taken :)
Maybe in a purely technical sense, yes, you\'re right.  The illustrator has the
job of bringing something on a written page to life.  If you\'re bringing to
life a grav-tank in Traveller, you can have a number of options of how to do
it.  You can do it in a purely dry technical illustration, or a cutaway view,
or you could illustrate the grav tank in "action", at rest in a hangar with a
prep crew buzzing around it, or on the battlefield, or something in that vein.
All the options are valid.  If you\'re bringing to life background information
(which is what people seem to play Traveller for, really), then cutaway views,
and concise, no-frills illustrations start to lose their luster.  The
MegaTraveller Rebellion sourcebook does a good job at illustrating the text
with artwork, as an example.  The pictures create a mood, and are internally
consistent (combat armor looks the same in every picture, uniforms and
insignia are illustrated "in action" on troopers).

Two of the better illustrations in T4 are in the FF&S2 book:  The picture of
two and a half Imperial Marines with their plasma rifles was a good one (and
it helps that I can point to the picture and say to my players: "_This_ is
what a plasma rifle will do to you if it hits you"), and the picture of the
Trepida-style grav-tank in battle is another.  The Emperor\'s Arsenal is also
filled with good examples (one ACR picture has a recon/scout woman on alien-
beastback with the rifle in hand that sticks out in my mind).  This is the
kind of stuff I would like to see in future Trav books.  The lack of artwork
of this type hurt Aliens Archive which is an otherwise fantastic book.  I\'d
like to see aliens with their artifacts, I\'d like to see an image of a Graytch
jungle-gym city or space-ship interior, maybe some drawings of Bye-Ren (sp)
jewelry (the only luxury that they seem to allow themselves).  It is stated in
the text that some of them make intricate jewelry.  How intricate?  Do they
wear it prominently?  Hidden?  All of this could be answered in one 2"x3"
illustration.

A picture is worth a thousand words, and alot of cultural ideas can be brought
across in a picture.  Clarity for clarity\'s sake is important when you\'re
talking FF&S2, for example, but the majority of Traveller books aren\'t going
to be FF&S2, most of them are going to be more background oriented.  And
that\'s when you\'re going to start needing pictures more and more.  What are
the current styles among Vilanese nobles?  How much jewelry do they wear as a
race?  What do the Emperor\'s guards wear?  What does the emperor himself look
like?  How about the Solomani, what do they like to wear?  What did the
Ancient warbots on Vland look like?  Were they Knobbly?  Sleek?  Yes, you can
answer all this in text, but not as easily or concisely as you can in an
illustration.  And if every illustration is going to be an all-business
illustration, the RPG books are going to look like text books...  And nobody
wants to roleplay from a textbook.

Didn\'t even need to go into post-modernism or expressionism or any of the
other things that aren\'t needed in a roleplaying book.  I don\'t think anyone
was actually saying, "Hey, I\'d like to see some cubist portraits of Imperial
Marines in my next Trav book" anyway.  I think illustrative _art_work is
needed in any RPG.  Not merely technical illustrations.

(As a note, I _like_ technical illustrations quite a bit.  I like the look of
schematics and diagrams and all that good stuff.  I just don\'t think that\'s
all that should be in a Traveller book)

	this can only be half of the bill, the reason is simple :

	- 30% of a jump drive is HPG. I\'ve calculated the following for
	  a 100dt ship

		Tj j effec   HPG   Mj
		10 1 0.080   9.3  116.7
		11 2 0.060  14.0  233.3
		12 3 0.050  18.7  373.3
		13 4 0.045  23.3  518.5
		14 5 0.040  28.0  700.0
		15 6 0.035  32.7  933.3

	So the HPG of a 100dt/Tl12/J3 ship can store 373.3 Mj in 18.7m3
	of HPG. So this magical 64Mj/m3/parsec has to pulsed, and has to
	build - probately together with the jump fuel - the so called jump
	bubble.

	To make a J3 it would need 720 HPG pulses. If I dont limit HPGs,
	I open a lot can of worms in larger ships with 100th of weapons
	sharing the same HPG round robin. If I limit HPGs to a rate of
	fire of 25*Tl, as it was discused some times ago, it cant make
	a jump within one hour. If I limit it to this value, I have a nice
	magic formular. This is probately only valid for TNE/MT, as I dont
	have FFS2.

	 (j+1)^2      1
	---- ~= --, which is 5% funny is\'nt it ;-)
	mw * jmul    20

	where : jmul = jump fuel displacement / jump drive displacement
	        mw   = mj*tl*50/3600
	        mj   = energy stored in the jump drives hpg

	this would mean that a tl:9, j1 ship would need 14% fuel instead
	of the usual 10%, while high tech ships show the normal 4,3,2,1,0.5
	improvement as in MT from Tl17+.
	
	But also in T4 should be clear, that trying to store 64*m3*parsec Mj
	at once in the jump drive HPG, would cause 2d20 major hits in jump
	drive and power plant, because of HPG overcharge - for further
	reference see the black globe chapter.

of a kind) and the acquisition of knowledge.  He always look like he has a
few items for sale (one of the items he sold my players is a bottle that
seem to produce an endless supply of alcohol after you put water inside
(what they don,t know is that the inside of the bottle is coated with a
microrganism that breaksdown water molecule and turns them into 40 proof
alcohol.  While it does not appear like much at first, imagine what will
happen after a few of these micro organisms infect the water supply of the
ship...)).  

As to the second aspect (the acquisition of knowledge) he always seem to
know everything about everybody.  He will refuse not to sell information. 
In my campaign (Spinward Marches, 1105), he actually has some ideas about
the infighting in the Navy (Naval Intelligence vs Naval Information) or
about the tug of power between Norris and Santanocheev.  For some strange
reason, Fingers has never been bothered by the authorities about his
knowledge.

As to the psionic aspect of the character, the description in the JTAS no:
14 indicates that if anyone attempts to read his mind, they will get random
bits of information but nothing coherent.  He doesn\'t how this is produced.
 

I have had a lot of fun with this NPC.

data, and I\'ve stumbled into a little quandary regarding the
inclusion (or exclusion) of brown dwarves. As some of you may know,
brown dwarves are those "failed stars" as it were... stars that
might have been, except that they were too small, never got nuclear
fusion going, and so ended up not being stars at all. These brown
dwarves have anywhere from 10-84 times the mass of Jupiter and
could conceivably have a planetary disk, however, all the worlds of
such a system would be shrouded in perpetual darkness.

As might be expected, astronomers can\'t see such (non)star systems,
as there isn\'t any light being generated to touch their telescopes,
however, some people think that the presence of brown dwarf
systems, in ample quantity, could account for a sizable portion of
the "dark matter" astronomers believe is out there. Likewise, one
might speculate that a nearby brown dwarf could explain some of the
"wobble" in pluto\'s orbit that once led to speculation about a
"Planet X" which has never been discovered. Unfortunately, I\'m not
schooled in either astronomy or physics, so I can\'t personally
theorize as to the number of brown dwarf systems which are out
there. This is where I need help from those of you know something
about astronomy and physics.

Do you think: (1) brown dwarfs systems are exceedingly rare, that
usually, if a brown dwarf occurs, it\'ll be orbiting a star, not out
in interstellar space, (2) brown dwarf systems do happen, but they
are no more common than normal star systems, (3) brown dwarf
systems are very common, more common than "normal" star systems...
perhaps much more common, (4) perhaps more than a thousand times
as common...

This question has obvious importance for any sfrpg, because if they
are common, then brown dwarves would represent possible deep space
fueling stations for interstellar craft. There could even be an
entire society of belters and whatnot living in a brown dwarf
system. Such entities would be too important to leave off the
starcharts.

So... any takers?

Yes; brilliant!  Those who truly seek mystical union with Her must,
obviously, well, bring themselves closer to the state of Kenhood.

  My estimate was based strictly on the size of a full Aurora, which
is, according to Path of Tears, the basis for the Lancer/Fusilier.
Your reference caused me to pull out Battle Rider and look. The
Fusilier/Lancer is included (with a picture!), and does indeed have
several stats that are superior to the 3000ton Midu Agashaam (see
Supplement 9: Fighting Ships, page 16) and the 1000ton Chrysanthemum
(same book, page 14).
  Based on the picture on the counter, it could indeed be that big,
since a fully loaded Aurora is pretty puny looking next to it. It is
going to be roughly the same length, so for argument sake I dug into
FF&S-1. A Needle hull would need to be 8000tons to get the aparently
needed 180 meter length. That is adding a LOT of meat to the bony
Aurora. We could plead fuzzy rounding rules and get that down to a
7000ton hull (171m hull, space range of Meson spinal 5-2/3 hexes) or
maybe all the way to 6500tons (165m hull, Meson range 5.5 hexes).
the tonnage suggested by the BR point value (6250tons) leads to a
length of 162m (Meson range 5.4 hexes). We CAN get away with this
because the Aurora is getting away with it. At 144 meters long, its
BR range is listed as 5, when it is really slightly below 4.5.
  This is still twice the size of a Midu Agashaam and three times
the size of the original Aurora fully loaded. Ain\'t streamlining
marvelous?
  I note also that the Lancer/Fusilier is listed as having limited
maneuver. What ARE they filling all that space with, if not with 
reaction mass?

I think he means that if you know when the ship starts the jump cycle,
you\'ll know where it\'ll be *when it jumps*, not where it\'ll come out. 

That seems fairly reasonable. Only thing is, I can\'t see that there\'s
anything observable when you start charging the drive. It\'s when you
start dumping the power into the jump grid (or creating the jump field,
depending on which vwersion of jump drives you use) that the "visible"
effects start.

I submit that you *can* dump the energy, but only at the cost of
dumping all your spare fuel/water as *hot* plasma. That\'s not the sort
of thing you can do as a "normal" means of getting rid of heat. But it
beats what\'ll happen to the ship if you *can\'t* dump the energy.

This also means that pirates would rather *not* go after a ship that\'s
gotten much of the power for jump stored. If a weapons hit damages the
capacitors/HPGs/whatever, it\'ll likely ruin the ship and cargo.

Why send in the infantry at all if you can stand off and turn their
homeworld to glass? As they were throwing asteroids at earth at the same
time, it seems a legit response. In fact, IIRC they don\'t do this in the
book because they don\'t want to harm any PoWs. The fleet gets to Klendathu
without any problems at all, so remember "let\'s take off and nuke it from
orbit. It\'s the only way to be sure."

(*) Not to mention getting them to group nicely together, or abandon their
fixed defenses before they could escape.

One of the big costs in the show was the bridge of the Galactica, it
contained several Million dollars of Tektronix test equipment.  Originally
the show was intended to be 3 parts, the first part being the 3 hour
original show, the 2 hour show where they discovered Kobol, and a third 2
hour show (no idea what it was supposed to be).  The network executives
were so impressed with the first 3 hour show they made it a series.

Later parts were cut out of the original 3 hour show to shorten it, and it
was shown in Theaters.  I still have fond memories of being able to feel
the Galactica ROAR through space, in the theatre I saw it in!

I always thought it strange they took it from TV and put the shortened
version in the Theatre.  Sort of the opposite of Buck Rodgers, where it
went from being a movie to I believe the first two episodes of the TV show.

According to the Clute/Nicholls _Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_, the Star
Wars novelization is "attributed to Lucas but rumoured to have been written
by Alan Dean Foster". Seems quite likely; Foster is the acknowleged king of
SF movie novelizations. Note also that he wrote the first Star Wars tie-in
novel, _Splinter in the Minds Eye_. I suspect that a close comparison of
the style and diction of the two books would clinch the argument.

Personally, I refuse to believe Lucas wrote the book - the "standard
timeparts" line is a dead giveaway. The screenplay is full of unspeakable
dialogue and misused terminology, not only "parsecs", but also "droids"
(from "android" - which the droids definitely aren\'t), "turbo lasers" (eh,
what?), and "She\'ll make point five past lightspeed" (gee, that\'ll get us
there in about, oh, five hundred years?).

According to a recent TV documentary, the actors tried to get Lucas to fix
up the dialogue - at least to make it easier to spit out. But Lucas
*refused* to change a word. He just didn\'t care. The effects, the costumes,
the lighting, the atmosphere - these are things Lucas cared about. Good
dialogue seems to have been low on his list of concerns. It could be argued
that this is appropriate, in keeping with the sci-fi adventure serials on
which _Star Wars_ was modelled.

Alan Dean Foster, on the other hand, is a professional SF writer (though
merely a competent one, IMO), and I imagine he couldn\'t bring himself to so
blatantly mis-use the word "parsecs". His SFFWA friends would all laugh at
him.

I know I would.

Putting my question more succinctly ... at what range could a 100 kiloton
nuke warhead completely destroy a det laser missile with one centimeter
thick hull of
superdense ? At what range could it fry the electronics on board ?

The question is important, becasue it will determine the "spacing" of
missiles,
in order that one defending nuke missile doesnt take out multiple attacking
missiles.

Oops, sorry I was unclear.

I mean that you know where the target ship will be when it leaves the system.

You are quite correct that you don\'t have a clue where its going or when it
will
arrive there.

Most merchants cannot significantly charge their jump capacitors until they
turn
off their thrusters, so once they start coasting, you can expect jump
capability
after one hour.

It is a significant point, because if you can\'t hold the energy for a long
time,
you can\'t charge the capacitors, attempt a bit of piracy, then jump out if
it all
goes wrong.

That\'s what I like about TML, the constant revelation that my knowledge is
so limited!

Still it\'s nice to know that George Lucas could make an error in
overestimating fan\'s credulity even if he didn\'t make an error with the
unit in the first place.

Also, fun to think of Han not really being that bright after all.  Gives
hope to the dimmest of us.  Perhaps one day Marc will reveal that Cleon
wasn\'t as good an Emporer as he thought he was!

So unless the ship has enough energy to do everything at once (ie about twice
as much as your average merchant needs) - once you turn on the jump drives
the ship starts coasting and one hour later it either jumps, misjumps or
spreads itself thinly across the galaxy.

Possibly, a jump 3 ship can energise jump 1 in twenty minutes (if so, I\'ll
keep that
thought in mind \'cos the PCs in he campaign I am preparing will have jump 3).

Oooohh the biochemist in me cringes...you can\'t \'break down\' water and get
alcohol...still need a some carbons in there. Once you do that all the

To the best of my knowledge it was never published.  But I\'m still looking

No inquiries.  Nothing at all.

Now, I\'ll admit that the Internet has been behaving a tad strange lately
(bouncing messages that the recipient did in fact receive, for example),
so it is conceivable that IG has attempted to reply and I didn\'t get it. 
On the other hand, I _did_ include my phone number, and I\'ve had no phone
calls...

Andrew, could you please forward them my message? (As you obviously _can_
get through, and as they obviously listen to you.)  I won\'t be able to
phone VISA until tomorrow evening anyway (my office phone won\'t dial long
distance, even toll-free long distance!) and I have several after-school
meetings today, so IG has a window to communicate with me.  Failing that I
may try a collect call to California before calling VISA, to give them one
last chance.

Well, I _have_ been working on a couple of 101 manuscripts (other than 101
Vehicles).

One is 101 Lessons, an outline for using Traveller in the classroom. 
Although given IG\'s record, I\'m broadening that into using games in
general in the classroom.  The great thing is that I may be able to get
funding for this to cover printing (leaving the price to cross-subsidize
other BITS products)!

The other is 101 Sports, a compendium of recreational activities.  The
treatments would range from a full mini-game (grav-ball, maybe, if the
author if the rules I have is agreeable to being republished), down to a
short description.

Any thoughts on these?

<\'Exclusive\' means that only my company, Juggernaut Press, can develop and

There will be at least two commercial PBM/PBEM versions of Traveller from
Juggernaut Press, the first a strategic wargame (\'Emperors of the Flag\') and
the second an open-ended role-playing game spanning the entire Traveller
universe.

To keep tabs on these games, subscribe to the Traveller PBM Mailing List by

I would hope that someone is working on a QSDS 2.0, simply because I feel
the current system has some annoying limitations, and would like it to
become more comprehensive, but only in ways that wouldn\'t add complexity
(like a bigger basic hull/G rating selection). The QSDS has the potential
to be similar to the old CT system, in as much as it could be simple and
still fairly comprehensive.

>2. If 1. is true, will this be considered as the new ship design system

The rest of T4.1 is being revamped and examined, so it stands to reason
that some sort of revision will be included.

>3. Has anyone been using the RPSCS (Role-playing ship combat system), or

I have never seen this, and am thus speaking out of ignorance, but I
question if it\'s really needed. The starship combat system as it stands is
fairly simple (though some may say simplistic), and really quite easy to
use once you get the hang of it.

>4. Will the RPSCS be considered as the basis of the new ship combat
>system?

Many people like the old, and simple, range band based system, so I\'d vote
for keeping it. However, I do feel that there\'s a need for some other
system, like Mayday for CT or Brilliant Lances for TNE.

I\'m currently working on a version of Mayday compatible with T4, using the
basic starship combat tasks from T4, and the vector based movement system
from Mayday (which was brilliantly simple I might add).

If you look at what we have today, with the smallest stars being the 
most populous, and the large stars being rare, togehter with the fact that
there seems to be 3 to 4 gas giants per star, and 4 to 6 smaller planets
per star (our solarsystem) an interpolation of these data would suggest
that brown dwarfs are more common than M stars and less common than gas
giants. This is still not much to go on though. I would quess that many
brown dwarfs in habit the interstellar space and equally many orbit stars,
being one of the members of binary, trinary ... starsystems. I would say
that you actually can do whatever you like :-) Do what is best for your
universe and is the best for roleplaying with your group.

I would include at least a couple of brown dwarfs in our local group, just

I\'ve been working on an improved hit/damage system that could be 
integrated into RPSC (or even a more basic system like T4.0\'s.) The goals
were to address some of the flaws in the existing systems:

- -a hit always disables the system it hits and nothing else, whether it\'s a 
dinky laser hitting a battleship or a spinal mount hitting a fighter

- -ablative armour (with the side effect that batteries of tiny high ROF 
weapons are *much* better than big weapons of the same mass)

My system adjusts the severity of a hit (No effect/Light Damage/Heavy Damage/
Critical Damage) based on the weapons damage value and target\'s size; and 
separates penetration of armour from total damage of a battery. I\'m 
still working on getting the to-hit probabilities right - high ROF gets only
a to-hit bonus, not a damage bonus, but for every 3 point syou make the 
to-hit roll by the damage is increased by one point (to represent multiple
hits) but *not* the penetration (to avoid the machine-gun-vs-battleship)
problem. It\'s designed to be relatively quick and clean - not much math,
relatively simple tables, all relevant numbers written into the ship\'s
USD.

The other big question I\'m wrestling with in this is whether to go with the
current USD chart (for converting weapon damages from "centimeters of steel"
to a simpler scale) or replace it with a pure log chart - the latter has
all sorts of mathematical advantages but would mean a fair amount of 
effort to convert T4.0 designs to the new system.

I posted a draft to trav-tech and can forward one to anyone else interested;
I\'ll probably hold off on posting a draft here until I\'m a little more
advanced.

You\'re right on two big points:

2. We don\'t need yet another system.


I wondered out loud what a CSDS (Classic Ship Design System)
would look like because it was blindingly fast, and my group
seems to be heavier into roleplaying than gearheading.

To maybe clarify what I was thinking about, I wanted to see
groups of parts made available as off-the-shelf component packs,
to the point where building a ship would more resemble the CT
system.  I figured there was a point where the aggregatization
brings the system into something that would be as easy as CT.

The Electronics Pack selected sets the overall tech level of your 
starship.  Usually electronics packs are installed at the same TL

Also, electronics packs are often bundled in with the bridge; 
sometimes they are bundled in with the hull itself!

Optionally, the TL12 packs may also come with small power plants with
a fuel tank, to provide independent power to the components.

We now have about a dozen known brown dwarfs or transisitional objects 
(young warm things that are right at the border between brown dwarfs and
stars.) About half of them were detected indirectly (through radial velocity
variations in a star they orbit.) One was imaged directly as a companion
to a star (GL229B, the coolest stellar object known.) The rest are 
transitionals, either free-floating nearby or in the Pleiades.

Locally (in the galactic plane) this has been pretty much excluded. It\'s
not even clear what fraction of the disk mass is dark - between 50% and 
zero - but it\'s increasingly clear it probably isn\'t brown dwarfs. Out in
the galactic halo, where 90% or more of the mass is dark, brown dwarfs are
marginally exlcuded by the LLNL MACHO microlensing observations. 

>"wobble" in pluto\'s orbit that once led to speculation about a

The wobble was actually in Neptune\'s orbit - it\'s a long story, but the
consensus is that it was due to early observational errors and there\'s no
significant anomaly left. Some people speculated that a brown dwarf in a 
highly elliptical orbit ("Nemesis") could cause periodic mass extinctions;
this isn\'t completely exlcuded, though the evidence for periodicity in mass
extinctions is weak.

>theorize as to the number of brown dwarf systems which are out there

Unfortunately, in spite of the discoveries, the number of brown dwarfs
(especially at the low mass end) is poorly known. It\'s pretty clear that
they\'re not extremely common (not thousands of BDs per star...) It\'s fairly
technical, but opinion is probably divided between a flat mass function (
brown dwarfs about as common as 0.2 - 0.1 solar mass M-dwarfs) and a mildly
rising mass function (brown dwarfs 2-5 times as common as M-dwarfs) with a
falling mass function (brown dwarfs ten times rarer than M-dwarfs) not
yet excluded. Personally I believe in flat-to-falling (Macintosh et al
1996 BAAS 189 #120.05, Macintosh et al 1998 ApJ in preparation) because
I spent 6 years of my life looking for the damn things in the Hyades, but 
I may be prejudiced.

Overall - they should be fairly rare; about as many brown dwarfs as the
lowest-mass M-dwarfs, I think.

Where are you getting this?  Last I knew, military and civilian ships were
not installing different types of power plants.  The civvie and mil both
use the PP for all their energy needs *except* the jump drive needs.  In CT
and MT (my forte\'s) the PP had nothing whatsoever to do with jumping (you
could, for example, jump with a destroyed power plant).  Has T4 changed
this?

Your logic is absolutely correct.  But my understanding was that the Power
Plant incorporated a power generator which could initiate (and sustain) a
Jump.  I also believe the Jdrive has a "capacitor" which can store the
energy for some period of time (Starship Operator\'s manual was certainly
specific about how much time, earlier publications were certainly not, I do
not remember what SOM said.)  In the years I\'ve received this list I can
remember many suggestions, but my favorite was the existence of a flywheel
(a few hundred tons or so) connected to an alternator which can be fed the
power in a trickle and store it as kinetic energy.  When the power is
needed the alternator\'s turns into a "brake", quickly converting the
kinetic energy back into electricity for use in the Jdrive unit.

I like this method because it is exaclty what happens in the lab next door
when they are "running" the experimental tokamak fusion reactor, which
requires a significant pulse of electricity in a period of about 2 seconds.

With this picture in mind, it is my opinion that the merchant (or escort,
or battlewagon) can "store" energy for a jump indefinitely and with no
penalty at all, except that if it gets hit in the jump drive, it loses all
that energy immediately (and possibly catastrophically...I wouldn\'t want to
be around when a 100 ton flywheel spinning at 12000 rpms has its mounting
pins busted).

This does lead to some unwanted implications, why not just have your
capacitor "spun up" at the local starport by their \'ship-to-shore\' power
umbilical?  You could jump, then use the stored fuel you didn\'t need to
jump again.  The answer is that the fuel is used for other purposes as well
and the savings would not be significant.

Ah well, back to work...

That 64MJ figure comes from FF&S2, which also goes on to say that the
energy isn\'t actually stored IN the drive (or in capacitors).  The
explanation 
in FF&S2 is that the energy goes directly into the jump drive, which uses it 
to initiate the jump (in whatever manner jump drives initiate jumps).  The 
energy isn\'t (say) stored in the drive and then released  all at once,
because 
that would require energy storage technology that\'s significantly better than 
available elsewhere in Traveller.  The time limit comes from the ability to 
stabilize the jump interface.  The jump must be completed within an hour, or 
else the interface with jumpspace becomes too unstable and Something Bad 
happens (just what, is up to the referee).

Yep.  The time was increased from the Classic Traveller 40 minutes, since

Basically (thus the Vilani tradition of "jump dimming" - dimming the lights
and shutting down all non-essential systems to ensure that the jump drive
gets enough power).  The results of an aborted jump are up to the referee;
personally, I\'d allow a "safe" abort up through at least halfway into the
jump sequence.

Probably.  And a J2 ship should be able to energize a J1 in 30 minutes.
Many military ships will have enough power (if they are not operating weapons
or screens) to jump rapidly; the rules in FF&S2 or QSDS will help you
determine just how rapidly.

I routinely read my email at work during slow spots (waiting for compiles,
waiting for management to buy a clue, and so forth).  Usually, this causes
no problems.  However, now I\'m in the position of trying to explain why I
suddenly started laughing out loud...and I mean *loud*...while allegedly
debugging a memory allocation problem. 

This is f*cking *brilliant*, Kenji.  With your permission, I\'m going to
link to it from the THUDDD site.  Prominently.

Because Terran\'s are a bunch of warmongering pigs? ;-)

Actually, I can think of several good reasons for starting a war to coreward
that have nothing to do with economy or patriotism.

1.)  Sure there was plenty of room to expand rimward, but, what happens when
you get there?  Nothing, that\'s it you\'ve just "painted yourself into a
corner" and are stuck.  However, if you expand coreward, you have so much
more room to expand.

2.)  Besides, you can always expand rimward later.

3.)  War is good for the economy.  So much has been said on this in so many
historical contexts that I don\'t feel the need to say more.  Except to quote
an old saw that often comes up during war-time.  "It is an ill wind indeed
which blows nobody any good."

4.)  War is good for the technology.  Especially medical, weapons
transportation (especially in space) and related technologies.  And with
those three, what isn\'t related (technologically speaking).

5.)  War is good for the heart of a people.  Especially if you are winning.
If you\'re not, then you lie about it and get the same effect until the war
comes home.  If you are lucky the tides will turn and the people will never
be the wiser (except historically perhaps).  After all what raises the moral
of a people more than knowing that they or their loved ones are paying the
ultimate price in a noble and righteous endeavor?

My uninformed, non-astrophysicist opinion follows.

Given that red dwarves are ubiquitous in the galaxy, then
I\'d assume brown dwarves are also equally ubiquitous, or
perhaps an order of magnitude more common.

I\'d also say that BDs are out there on their own, and not
orbiting other stars.  Perhaps with a lot of debris in orbit
around them -- perhaps some diffused asteroid belt/belt system.
Could be useful for mining, but perhaps too remote or sparse
to bother with.

One might ask what kind of a sadistic pervert might be suggesting such a
thing, if one did not already know of equally disgusting phenomenon that are
also religiously promoted.  Forbidding some to marry, encouraging others to
flagellate, cutting the tender [ anatomical term removed by sensors] skin of
nubile young maidens, etc..

Oh well, different strokes (pun intended) for different folks.

It\'s got seriously thick armour - thick enough to put it well outside the
15 tonnes/ton range, so it needs a very big maneuver drive, with high

Why not?  In real life, a capacitor can hold a charge for days (ask any TV
repairman, if you can still find one of those around these days).

Or why not almost fully (like 99.9%) charge the engine.  You have almost an
hour to attempt your act of piracy, and if things are going well, you can
always bleed off the excess (since you are not going to jump) energy to
other systems (like weapons).

I know why it was acting that way and I presume it was built that way
\'cause that\'s the way the designer wanted it. I too have read and have a
copy of the GDW CT Double Adventure 1. Do you really want the answer? I
thought it was a really neat design.

I\'d just like to add that from a strictly roleplaying point of view, there
don\'t have to be distinct "phases" in a ship combat system. I admit to
*almost* completely winging it, but my goal in a ship-to-ship combat
between a PC run and a NPC run ship is for each PC to be intimately
involved in the action. Try to make it so nothing is cut and dried, nor is
there an ordered sequence of phases.

Imperium, but I suspect that it was supposed to represent the solomani
expansion versus the Villani (ok, maybe it wasn\'t - but it sounds good
<grin>).

  Ok, two cents worth appended below...


  A few background pieces of information are needed about how things were
at the time.  The first thing that comes to mind is "did Terra know how
big the Villani empire was"?  Also, is it possible that the Villani were
crowding the Terrans at the getgo, and Terra finally pulled the trigger
that started the war?  It is entirely possible that some diplomatic envoy
left the impression that earth will be assimalated into the Villani Empire
wether it wanted to or not?

  All wars are not started as a result of naked aggression.  If I recall
history correctly, Yamato designed the attack versus the American Navy at
Pearl Harbor as a defensive move, not offensive - and supposedly (or my
history is garbled perhaps?) even he didn\'t like the prospect of tackling
the American forces.

  Possible scenario that I can see at this point (and I am thinking in 3d
space terms, not 2d!):

  1) the ratio of habitable stars to unhabitable and distance from Earth
may have had something to do with the decision to expand closest to Earth
with respect towards habitable stars.

  2) it is possible that Earth saw Villani in "it\'s own form" in the sense
that they could not believe they would be assimalated into the empire.
Believing themselves in danger, they attacked first with the most
ferocity.

  3) it is possible that a translation error in languages caused a major
misunderstanding.  I recall an old film where a man was offered a chance
to go to the homeworld of aliens with trans stellar capacity.  They told
the humans they would like the humans to come along with them to their
world so that they could serve man.  He eventually got on board the ship,
but unfortunately for him, as the ramp door of the ship was closing, he
heard his female lover\'s voice despairingly cry out something to the
effect "they are not here to give service to man, they are here to eat
man!".  So, that kind of error in translation could have happened to
trigger a war.

  Personally?  I would suspect it was a matter of Earth saying "That star
is in our back yard only 14 light years away, while the Villani\'s capital
planet is some 165+ light years away - how dare they!"
 
  Until I can reread my material from Megatraveller, I can\'t speculate any
more or any differently...

Hello Folks,
  Based on the above, and assuming that it is correct <grin> (I don\'t have
the basis to doubt it or verify it), then the following questions are
raised in my mind:

1) the presumed age of the sun is approximately 5 billion years (give or
take).  If the max lifetime of the brown dwarfs with respect to radiating
energy is 3 million years, that should imply that there are going to be a
lot of burnt out brown dwarfs out there.

2) in reading about the accretion hypothesis, along with another
hypothesis about how stars are formed (one was about two drifting nebulae
colliding), how long does it take relatively speaking for enough
"hydrogen" mass to collapse inward to form such a beast?

I believe that I have the latest release of the original novel in front of
me.
It is an artists rendition of the famed "gorrilla suit", w/Rico holding a 
"flamer" at port arms. IIRC, the copy that you saw at K-Mart
("attention shoppers...today\'s bluelight special...")<g>, is the 
screen version released to book form.

If any one is interested, here is the publisher to contact:
	Ace Books
	The Berkley Publishing Group
	200 Madison Avenue
	New York, NY 10016
	USA

I hope that this helps. If you need further help, let me know.

Bruce, this might be more complicated, but how about actually giving
various systems hit points and using those to assess damage. Have two
scales side by side, one with damage and one with capability, as damage
builds capability falls.  Trying to actually use the same scale would be
asking too much, probably not possible, but if we could make this work it
would allow us to model degrading performance and damage builds.

I vote to change it to a rational scale.  Some sort of log scale would be a
good choice.

Hey Bruce,

From what I know of actual damage effects of weapons in real-life, the log
scale would be much more realistic (especially a natural log scale, which
most scientific calculators can handle).

One of my gripes about Traveller is the inability to stack armor.  In
real-life, it\'s not that difficult.  (Why do you think they use layers of
ballistic cloth, because it\'s lighter?  No way, because it\'s more
effective.)  The answer in RPG\'s is to subtract some from the penetration
factor for each layer it goes through.  If not the strength then perhaps the
square root of the strength.  I\'m not sure just how this works in real-life.
Perhaps some modeling is in order (Anyone got any guns I could borrow?).

If you  went with the square root rule, then...

Penetration Table
strength    deduction
 1-3               1
 4-8               2
 9-15             3
16-24            4
25-35            5
36-48            6
49-63            7
64-80            8
81-99            9
etc.              etc.

You know what they say, "A little realism goes a long way."  The more

Remember, these aren\'t the Solomani, they\'re (more or less) people just
like us. The sense that I\'ve gotten from reading the sketchy sources on the
IW period is that the Vilani controlled the hospitable planets near earth
(examine the Imperium map--the Vilani get by far better position than the
Terrans). Imagine what just one hospitable, exploitable planet, accessible
by FTL drive would mean to us; it\'d be more than enough to make every son
of Sol* rich, or more likely, to make a few of them wealthy beyond Bill
Gates\' dreams of avarice. Combine this factor with the fact that we will
have little notion of the actual size of the Ziru Sirka until several
hundred years into the Interstellar wars ("You mean Dingir isn\'t the
capital?")--by which time the Vils are on the run and there\'s more money to
be made collecting taxes and plundering planets than starting vast,
long-term, capital-intensive settlements.

Now, regarding the actual incident at Barnard\'s Star, we have no way of
saying what happens. Could well have been the equivalent of the Gulf of
Tonkin. But the Terrans\' reasons for taking on the Vilani are
straightforward, especially after the Vils put a couple of nukes on Alpha
Centauri.

* The sexism is intentional; I\'m not nearly enough of a Whig to believe
that social change operates in a single direction--and I much prefer the
notion of a Terran Confederation that keeps every woman at home, churning
out new soldiers to feed to the front to the old DGP notion of "tuber
colonies."

Hmmm. This has all sorts of secondary effects, such as players saying "Can
we have a computer system with 20cm of armour, so it wont blow up like out
last three".

Now the answer is of course, yes, you can - use component armour out of
FFS2. But it is going to be hard to keep it simple and add the bells and
whistles.

Stick with same four steps of damage for everything, perhaps with suggested
rules making any hit "heavy" on especially delicate components.

Log scales work. It isnt that much errata to change starship weapon factors

I disagree completely. I\'m not a physics geek, but I suspect the reason
ballistic cloth is layered is the problems of weaving thick ballistic
cloth. Most armours I know of on, say, tanks, are cast as plates or blocks
(Chobham may be different ... I dont know).

N total thickness of armour(s) should always have n value, whether it is in
1 block or a hundred sheets. To do it any other way is demanding rules
lawyers exploit the system to hell and back.

One can protects one ship from fire from one ship for one turn.

25mm was a translation to map scale. In "reality", the sand would spread to
the tens of kilometers. The sand is ablative crystals that expands into
laser-absorbant plasma when struck by laser fire.

One can, one dm vs fire from one ship.

You\'re actually thinking quite low tech here. With the stuff being made at
(TL8) cutting edge technology for flywheels you see the use of advanced
composites (to allow higher speed through resistance to burst) and magnetic
bearings. When I was working on flywheel design we were unusual in that we
used a hydrodynamic bearing in combination with passive magnetic bearings
to achieve around 42000 rpm (*) with a 110 kg composite structure. We did
have a totally active magnetic system too, but that was hard on the control
side. I think that mechanical bearings are increasingly unlikely with
higher TL.

Visions of high energy storage units involved banks of modular flywheels
rather than large single units as this is less stressful on the material
components and design (not to mention the cost advantage of multiple
units). Also, bear in mind that the governing equation is 0.5 x I x W^2, so
spinning faster is better than getting heavier.

The real advantage (once you get to higher tech levels) is the elimination
of losses through superconductivity, and the ability to use gravitic
technology to levitate the wheel. I suspect that the unit would still be
run in a vacuum (because even the few molecules we had in a vacuum >1e-5 mB
caused a significant drag on the rotor).

Hmm. I\'ve been around a 110kg unit failing at 42k rpm. Very deep scary
rumble and then lots of carbon smoke as (1) a vacuum fitting failed and (2)
oil in a backup turbovacuum pump was vapourised. LLNL in the US has burst a
small wheel at 65000 rpm (less mass than our unit) successfully, and IIRC
BMW had a nasty accident in Turin killing at least one researcher because
they were very stupid with their containment philosophy.

I still think that mounting pins are unlikely due to frictional losses.

NB The \'wheel\' in flywheel is misleading as it is not the most safe and
effective configuration.

(*) The design was for higher speed than this, but we didn\'t complete
testing as the company was closed due to the group deciding to \'focus on
core business\'. (Anyone  know of any flywheel companies who want a
development engineer?)

One thing to remember is that BDs *will* be easily detected by the
spaceborne observatories that both astronomers and the Imperial Survey
will be using. At least many of the larger ones will.

But they will tend to be ignored for the most part, as unless they have
some *convenient* sized gas giant or ricy bodies in orbit around them,
you could get stuck there. Skimming from a BD is *not* what I\'d called
safe. 

So unless you have a ship that can jump there and back without
refueling, it\'s not wise to vist them. Any planets around them will be
*really* hard to spot with ship carried sensors.

Still, if you did locate one with planets or belts with the right mice
of ices, CHONdrites, rocky and metal bodies I\'m sure that there\'d be
folks willing to move out there, <insert reason>.

No.

In Classic Traveller, a power plant was required in order for the jump drive
to function.  Book 2 requires that a ship\'s power plant number be at least
equal to the jump drive number or maneuver drive number (whichever is larger).
Book 5 spells out the requirement in greater detail, but the effect is the
same.  Both books also indicate that a jump drive requires both power input
AND jump fuel (Book 5 does so explicitly, in the section on Black Globes).

MegaTraveller changed this by stating that a jump drive was a high-output
power plant of some type, in the Starship Operators\' Manual.  This rationale
allowed a ship to jump without a working power plant.  Traveller: The New Era 
wasn\'t terribly clear on the point, and glossed over the subject.  T4 returns
to the Classic Traveller model (and jump fuel consumption rates).

When working on FF&S2 for T4, Dave Golden and I took a look at a lot of these
options, to decide which one "worked" as part of an integrated design system.
The "jump drive as power plant" idea was out of line with other Traveller
power sources (producing MUCH more power per ton, even when the high fuel
consumption was worked in), while the "jump capacitors" from High Guard had
an energy storage density several times the next-best items in FF&S.

SO, we worked out an explanation for the jump drive (included in FF&S2) that
preserves the Classic Traveller "look and feel" (that jump drives require
both power and fuel, take a certain amount of time to prepare for jump, and 
must execute the jump within a limited amount of time after initiating the 
process) without requiring any of the problematic technologies.

This is the basic idea behind a homopolar generator, or HPG, which is the
power-storage device of choice in FF&S (both editions).  Unfortuately, while
FF&S2 HPGs are considerably better than the current equivalents, they still
don\'t store enough energy per ton that one could store enough energy for a
jump, and still fit within the jump drive.

That\'s exactly the sort of thing I mean by "problematic technologies".

Planning for Pearl Harbor started in the Japanese Naval College in 1914.
Not the attack per se, but planning for a war with the US in the Pacific,
as the Japanese rightly saw that the US was the power to be reckoned with
there, once they had defeated the Russians.

Yamato did not want to attack the US like they did, and predicted,
particularly if the attacking force missed the US carriers, that Japan
would ultimately lose the war. The Japanese High Command gambled on US
isolationism forcing a negotiated peace if the US Pac fleet was destroyed. 

Yamato who had been to college in the US and knew America extensively,
knew differently, that a surprise attack would likely galvanize the US
into the war. He gambled that catching the US carrier fleet in Pearl would
keep the US from carrying the war to Japan until the Japanes Pacific
empire was well entrenched with protected supply lines for Japanese
industry, particularly petroleum supply which was their vital weak point.

ISTR reading that when he was told that no US carriers were lost at Pearl,
he turned to his aides and said "We have lost."

I don\'t see much evidence for this. There a LOT of space to rimward. Not
mapped within canon Traveller, but we\'re not on the galactic rim by any
stretch of the imagination.

The Terrans, in any case would not have likely submitted lightly to
becoming a mere chattel of the Vilani Empire. You also have to realize
that the Vilani had not run into a race that had developed Jump drive on
its own in what, a couple thousand years? There was no precedent for
handling the contact between Vilani and another major race except in the
very early Vilani wars. Undoubtedly there were also things said to the
effect that Terra owed huge amounts of royalties on the jump drive patents
and other inventions that there already \'owned\' by Vilani megacorps. There
were probably some questions about who had \'given\' us Jump drive
technology.

"To Serve Man", My favorite Twilight Zone Episode of all time, and a short

was redone for the modern Twilight Zone series as well.

Hmm. Like the airplane takeoff routine, V1 being when you\'re going fast
enough to have a chance of liftoff, V2 being when you have no other choice,
and "rotate" being when you actually unstick. I can hear those voices on

Amen to that. Slipping release dates to do it right is absolutely the right

Subject: Crew accomodations
   Sat around this past weekend watching old WW II naval movies and came up
with some additions to the accomodations table.  While they are intended for
ships of the Terran Confederation, they could theoretically be used in other
eras (M:1200 in particular where crew are rather large).  Basic staterooms,
etc. are included for comparison:<<

Aha! The campaign I\'m currently putting together is going to be set in the
Terran Confederation time period, sounds like you have already done that.
Any thoughts, advice, interest in sharing ideas either here or in a private
discussion? I plan to use the CHVIEW star viewing programme and Gliese
local star data to build a 3D map, other than that I\'m basing things on
Imperium the boardgame and CT.

Hey, neat idea! What happens when you try to turn the ship? Helluva

It now appears that the aforementioned comrades did, in fact, receive the

language processing systems to "translate" it.  It can be found at
<http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Chamber/2662/sayisba.html>.

XITF #15 would like to request that the Imperial Navy withhold firing on
any large, spherical starships with a minimized sensor profile which may
suddenly appear in-system during the next week.  This slight confusion
should be cleared up by that point.

Thank you.

1) the ratio of habitable stars to unhabitable and distance from Earth
may have had something to do with the decision to expand closest to Earth

Looking at the Gliese data and the current assumptions for habitable stars
(single, main-sequence, luminosity 0.4 to 2.0) I reckon there are only half
a dozen candidates within 15 pc of Sol (out of several hundred stars in
that volume), and most of \'em are in an arc with Tau Ceti in the middle. If
I remember rightly, that\'s rimward of Sol, so the logical expansion would
be that way - maybe the Vilani had gone around us? They only had Jump-2,
which would make them lean towards 2300 AD style tramlines between stars
(unless ships routinely carried extra jump fuel); maybe they could only
approach one way. And if Earth thought it was already surrounded...

The Consolidation Wars mentioned in several canonical sources leave me with
the strong impression that when the Vilani found you, you joined their
empire - voluntarily or feet first...

That\'s pretty much what it says in the MT Imperial Encyclopedia. I reckon
you go with whatever makes for the best campaign, and that could well mean
setting it up so it looks like one of these is right, then having the PCs
find out later on that it\'s really another cause entirely...

Yes, I was wondering whether it was a novelization of the movie screen
play or if it was the original novel with the movie photos splashed on the
cover.  I\'ll have to take a closer look whenever I see it again.  Maybe if
it really is a bluelight special (hmnn, that means something else in

Yamamoto indeed did NOT relish the idea of attacking the US Navy...he knew
(and told the Imperial Staff) that he would only be victorious for the first 6
months of the war.  The rationale behind the Pearl Harbor attack was to
eliminate the Pacific Fleet as a force that could intervene in Southeast Asia
(Sumatra, the Dutch East Indies, etc)  which was Japan\'s PRIMARY objective
(which he did).  The idea being that after this was done, America would rather
accept the situation than fight a war...one of the grosser miscalculations in

So this was indeed an offensive move...just not the primary one.

Hey that sounds pretty interesting. Would you like to submit a
description of the base to my Ancients-sites-list. I am always on the
lookout for new site descriptions, canon or self-made. As a matter of
fact, i am writing up some of them to be added when i update my site end
of the month.
Anyway, i would be happy to quote some of your material with
acknowledgements, of course.

Lose the current USD chart - it is goofy enough that I would prefer one
with logic.

BTW, while I do not expect this to fly, I would rather leave the (cm of
steel) numbers in, as it turns a random small integer into a real world
unit.  I do not expect to win that, as Traveller has never been happy with
real world units in damage systems. :)

It\'s the deuterium-burning phase that lasts only a few million years, not
the whole radiating phase - the brown dwarf still has lots of 
left over gravitational energy to radiate. As Archie T. wrote, they\'ll radiate
for up to several billion years at increasingly low temperatures.
(For example, a 40 jupiter mass brown dwarf has a surface temperature
of about 1200K when it\'s a billion years old, and 700 K if it\'s 4.6 billion
years old (solar-age.)) Still, a jupiter-sized object (all brown dwarfs are
about jupiter-radius in size) that\'s 700K is quite hard to find, which is 
why so few of them are known. (The coolest brown dwarf detected through
direct imaging is around 1000 K.) So there *could be* a lot of undetected
brown dwarfs out there, but it doesn\'t mean that there necessarily are;
as I said, the best guess is that they\'re about as common as very low mass
M-dwarfs.

Accretion/star-formation is pretty quick - sort of million-year timescales
for low mass stars, hundres of kiloyears for bigger stars.

   Unless you can see in infrared--most of the light a brown dwarf would put
out is of that spectra.  Also, while brown dwarfs can have substanial mass,
diameter-wise they wouldn\'t get anymore than 2-3 times that of Jupiter.
Why?  Because the material that makes up a brown dwarf is more densely
packed together due to gravity.

   In reality (based upon the knowledge of someone who has had 9 credit
hours of Astronomy in college, and has read extensively on the subject
since), brown dwarfs are probably much less common than gas giants.  Going
on the order of scale from planetismals to moons to "rocky" planets like
Mercury and Earth up to gas giants like Jupiter and Neptune, you see fewer
and fewer objects as you go up in scale.  If nature (contrary to 51 Pegasi)
favors smaller objects, because the circumstances of substellar object
formation or some mechanics we aren\'t aware of yet, then brown dwarfs would
be rarer still.  Recent survey results of the Pleiades (in the estimation of
experts, the best place to look), yielded only a very few brown dwarfs, this
despite predictions that many would be found.

   This just in from the Internet, regarding the most recent observations
(source - Marcy and Butler
http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/planetsearch.html):

"Bottom line: Approximately 3% of Solar Type stars harbor planetary
companions that have masses from 1 - 10 Mjup and orbit within a several
Astronomical Units (AU).  Approximately 1% of stars harbor brown-dwarf
companions within several AU. Their masses are spread out from 10 - 70 Mjup,
as demonstrated beautifully by the data of Michel Mayor, Antoine Duquennoy,
and Didier Queloz at Geneva Observatory and L\'Observatoire d\'Haute Provence."

   The studies conducted thus far on brown dwarfs have only considered them
as companions to "real" stars, not as "rogue objects" as you are suggesting.
Brown dwarfs are so dim that spotting a rogue at interstellar distances is
considered extremely difficult (read: they haven\'t found any).  *However*,
there have been theories advanced concerning the possibility of rogue gas
giants that would lend hope to the possibility of rogue brown dwarfs as
well, so it doesn\'t mean that rogue brown dwarfs don\'t exist at all.

   For *game purposes*, I would place a brown dwarf in a star system only if
a \'12\' were rolled for gas giant nature, and then I would declare the orbits
on either side of where it is place to be empty.  Further, the occurance of
rogue brown dwarfs that have anything resembling a planetary system around
them (or even an asteroid field substantial enough to draw interest) is
going to be too low for it to be something that you would put on a star
system generation chart.  My advice would be that if you want to have such a
system in a region you are developing for your campaign, go ahead, but I
won\'t have more than one or two per sector.

>This question has obvious importance for any sfrpg, because if they

>fueling stations for interstellar craft. 

   Using a brown dwarf as a fuel source is probably not a good idea.  While
they do not get as hot as a star, they are still *hot* (particularly when
they are massive enough and young enough to undergo deuterium burn), and
would have a pretty strong gravity well besides (as you would expect of an
object that is much more massive than Jupiter but only somewhat larger in
diameter).

>There could even be an

   This bring up another important point.  The fact is that when you look at
a subsector chart, you are probably not looking at every posssible object in
that region of space, and you may not even be looking at all the stars
either.  Real space is more crowded than the way it is presented in
Traveller, but on the other hand, no one wants to look at a subsector map
that has named systems in every hex, a significant percentage of which are
uninhabited and/or planetless stellar objects.

According to the standard Sayat technical manual (_Batteries, Pottery, and

is classified as "inauspicious", especially on days which are cubes of

The way I\'ve always thought of it was the first war was accidental.
Tensions had been building up for sometime and a minor incident started
a shooting war; nothing too unusual about that.

Why did the Terrans not just ignore the Vilani and expand rimward? This one
is simple, even though the Terrans did not actually realise just how big
the Vilani were at the start; they knew that were much bigger than them,
they knew that the Vilani had a history of forcing races with jump drive
into the Empire, they knew the Vilani policy on resistance was extermination,
they knew that the Vilani culture was just about entirely anathematic to the
Terran, and most importantly, they knew that the Vilani were just a single
jump-2 from Terra itself. Just take a quick look at the map and it becomes
very clear from the Terran PoV why they had to force the Vilani back. It\'s
a classic case of imperialism by suction; the Terrans have to go that way
or they risk annihilation by the much larger and more advanced Vilani.

Also according to AM6 and S$A during the Interstellar Wars, the Terrans were
also frantically expanding rimward. Presumably in an attempt to build a
base for survival if Terra should fall.

Well, it seems as if the thread I started has evolved into a discussion of
mid 20th century Japanese strategic policy. To bring it back onto topic
again let me share with you some ideas from my notebook. 

The only Yamamoto that I\'m familiar with from the First Interstellar War
(FIW) is the Terran "Admiralty" Class Destroyer Leader(DDL).
The Yamamoto (DDL-09) and her sisters were command variants of the 3000
ton "Battle" Class Destroyers. The extra tonnage was used for additional
fuel, life support, and C3I capability.

As for Vilani aggresion, IMO there wasn\'t any per se. In 2096, the Croome
Deep Space Array at Gateway Station (3.1 LY from Terra) began picking up
radio transmission from the Barnard System. The US Space Force dispatched
two Exploratory Survey Vessels, the ESV Challenger and the ESV Discovery
to investigate. Needless to say, the first contact with the Vilani caused
a great deal of shock. Although the expedition made its discovery in
August of 2096 it wasn\'t until almost a year later on July 2nd,2097 that
Carolyn Chandler-Davies, President of the United States of North America
(USNA) announced to the world that contact with another intelligent, star
faring civilization had been made. 

Prior to this announcement, President Davies, UN Secretary General Dr.
Matthias Kangele\', Yuri Khorsakhov(Director-General of the UN Space
Agency), and several other major world leaders had been meeting in secret.
Kangele and Chandler-Davies had managed to convince the others that the
Terrans
were in serious trouble. The people of terra were still divided along
nationalistic lines. In fact, there had been a pretty savage war fought
between PanAsia and the EuroUnion over asteroid mining rights in 2088. 

All agreed that it would only be a matter of time before the Vilani and
their Ziru Siirka absorbed the Terrans and their cultures. The Group set
forth a ten year plan that would culminate in a war between the Terrans
and the Vilani that would serve to unify the Terrans. There was of course
the danger that the Vilani would win but the general feeling among the
Group was that the Vilani were going to win in the long run anyway.

 It was actually 13 years before the 4,000 ton Guided Missle
Frigate, Krasny Sturm (Red Storm) fired the opening salvo in the Barnard
System and began a centuries long cycle of war.

An excellent idea, but don\'t forget that different systems would probably
react differently to damage.  Some would be put out of commission by any
damage.  Others could sustain almost total destruction before becoming

Not if they took longer to form, say about 3 or 4 million years more.  If,
for example, they formed from smaller pockets of prestellar matter, with
shallower gravitational wells, it would probably take them longer to coless.

If you are under acceleration (probably since you are trying to save your
ship), don\'t forget the effects that moving will have on your protection.
Once the enemy ship moves through the sand or around it (if they are coming
up along side) it\'s effectiveness is eliminated.

If neither predator nor prey are accelerating, probably the effects still
wouldn\'t last forever.  However, they would last as long as most space
combats could be expected to.

It (metrics) is simpler because it is decimal (how many cubic inches in a

with physics/engineering ie ship design, rules design but not necessarily

Drool. Could you post the radio-isotope reactor data you have (perhaps on
GDW-beta if here is inapporopriate)?

I\'m always searching for real world data to increase the difficulty of ever
creating my Ultimate Design System ;)

The Terrans get Prometheus (Alpha Centauri A), which is a hospitable world.
However, most of the rest inside their natural defensive area are pretty
poor; how else did so many worlds in the Sol subsector get great names like
"Dismal" and "Hades"?  

Note that the Vilani control the only jump-2 route out of the Dingir-Sol
region.  Look at a Solomani Rim map -- the Dingir-Sol area is a pocket of
mostly jump-2 spaced worlds separated from the rest of the sector by a
jump-3 "moat" on most sides.  The Vilani probably entered Dingir subsector
from the spinward-coreward side, where a major main leading back to the
core through Vegan space connects to the pocket.  The first seven or so
Interstellar Wars are confined to that pocket.  Once the Terrans invent
jump-3 drive, it\'s a lot easier to mount and supply attacks into the 
Vilani rear in Vegan space and cut off communication between Dingir and
the core.  But before they invent the jump-3 drive, they\'re confined to
the pocket unless they use the "deep space refueling station" trick.

I\'d have to look, but I seem to recall that the First Interstellar War
gets started over a dispute when a Vilani merchant convoy refuses to
obey Terran traffic signals at the Terran colony in the Barnard system.
(What did you say, Eneri?  A minor human race on the Rim has the jump
drive, and are using unlicensed ships to plant a colony on top of one
of our mining stations?  And they have the nerve to think *they* can
control interstellar traffic in the system when their own homeworld\'s 
government is still *balkanized*?  What a joke.)  For basic planetary
defense and sovereignty reasons, the Terrans can\'t tolerate this. 
(The only difference between a sub trader and a meteor is whether it
is under control and what its course is.) 

I get the impression that these wars were fairly small scale skirmishes
at first.  It seems to me that some Terran national fleet or the UN got
into the fight trying to enforce a territorial claim on Barnard, and 
ended up in over their heads when the local Vilani provincial governor
retaliated.  Between the internal infighting and Vargr raids, I\'d think
the Vilani could easily overlook the brush-fire wars on the Rim until
the Terrans broke out of their little pocket with their unheard-of new
technologies.

Anyhow, the Western policies towards the expanding Japanese in the 1930s
forced the war in the 40s. The US in particular tried to use embargo (oil
and other stuff) to make the Japanese back down. In doing so, they forced
them into a corner and seriously miscalculated the Japanese psyche. The
Japanese were forced to take action, and Pearl Harbour was the only way
they\'d have any chance. Take it out (most especially the airfields and fuel
depots) and the US fleet would have to operate from California. The Pacific
would beliong to Japan.

\'It\'s just some crummy little world. They know they can\'t win. We\'ll show
them a few gunboats and they\'ll surrender.\'

Which led to:

\'They haven\'t surrendered? They SHOT at the gunboats? Don\'t these people

\'They shot the cruiser?!? OK, send a strike group... oh, no need for
anything too big. The 11932nd will do. Yes, you can leave some of the

they\'ll trip over themselves on the way to the negotiating table.\'

\'The 11932nd was wiped out? Must have been a fluke. Send in the 22492nd

\'Yes, I really do think we need to ask for more ships....\'

\'What? Send in the....\'

\'What do you mean I\'m sacked? No, don\'t just send two cruisers! Send them

\'I told you that\'d happen.\'

\'Don\'t these people realise we\'ve got 110 more major battlefleets? They
can\'t possibly win!\'

\'I REALLY don\'t think it was a fluke, sir.\'

\'Yes, I really do think we need to move seven more fleets down from
Coreward.\'

(much much later)

No, of course they can\'t possibly attack the Capital. Don\'t they know it\'s
defended by the biggest, newest, BEST fleet we have...?\'

\'I think we might have underestimated these Terrans.\'

Subject: Re: Classic Traveller: sandcasters
Does the sandcaster...
1) Eject a can of sand that explodes outside the ship, creating a cloud of sand
that follows the ship on one side and protects from lasers on that side only?
2) Channel the contents of a can of sand through many orifices on the
ship\'s
hull, spreading a cloud of sand around all of the ship?
3) None of the above?
>>

If I remember rightly, none of the above but the effect was closest to (2).
You fired it out of a turret and it spread out all around the ship in a
cloud. However, once cast, the sand couldn\'t accelerate, so if you changed
vector at all you lost the sand completely. <<

And when the sand from this single can has been launched... How many cans of sand
does it take to cover 25 mm of map space with sand (to get that precious -3 DM)?
And where does this cloud go? 25 mm away from the ship in every direction or only
on one side? Which side? Does a 1000 ton ship get the same protection from a
single can of sand as a 200 ton ship? What if the laser gunner aims at the bridge
but the sand only covers the power plant? How long does it take a cloud of sand
to spread so thinly that it does not stop laser anymore? Another thing: 25 mm is
a linear distance, but a cloud of sand would surely spread in 2D, right?
In short, how are cans of sand actually used in game play? How are they
translated into DM\'s?
>>

Phew. In order, as best I can remember: (1) Just the one. Remember, it
wears off every time you change course or speed (including any kind of
evasion programme) or enter atmosphere. (2) 25mm in all directions. (3)
Yes, size doesn\'t count. (4) It covers the whole ship. (5) Good point. In
my games people dodge about so much I\'ve never really worried about it -
they lose it every turn or two. (6) Spreading in 2D - you know, I never
thought about that, but it must do. You eject it somehow, and I don\'t see
any way to cancel the momentum that imparts, unless you invoke a 2300 AD
electrostatic field holding it in place. (7) The best I could figure out
was that each canister gives you the DM, so the only reasons for multiple
sandcasters are either so you have a spare in case of damage, or to blast
the natives on the ground - sort of a giant shotgun for close in ship
defence. This is balanced by the fact that every time you dodge etc you
lose it all.

From memory the Mayday! boardgame had much clearer rules on this than CT
itself. I\'ll see if I can find my copy (haven\'t used it in about 10 years
but it should still be in the cupboard somewhere) and check it out.

Subject: The telephone company sold me my phone lines with an agreement...

The telephone company sold me my phone lines with the agreement that I
could make as many local calls as I liked, and of any duration I liked, for
a set monthly fee.  The cost of the local network divided by the number of
loops (lines) is the major part of the formula for calculating the monthly
cost of a line.  If the cost of the network has in fact gone up, then they
should apply for a re-rate.  If it hasn\'t, and they want to charge for
certain types of calls, such as internet log-on, then they are prying into
my private business.  It\'s none of their business what I use my phone for,
as long as I\'m making local calls.


Charging per-minute for phone calls for Internet access (as opposed to
"regular" calls) will violate the phone company\'s agreement with me.  Also,
it will violate my right to equal protection under the law.  To sell me and
"Trish Teenager" both a line at the same monthly rate, and allow her to use
hers to talk for four hours a day as part of the monthly rate but to charge
me per minute to use mine, even though we\'re both making local calls, just
because I\'m calling an Internet provider with my PC, is an infringement on
my right to "talk to" whomever I please (Free Speech).


It is also an infringement of my right to privacy: it\'s no one\'s business
what I use my phone line for.


Additionally, the use of email has reduced the amount of time people spend
talking on phones, particularly in the business and long-distance markets,
and THIS is what upsets the phone company.  If there were no Internet, given
the cheap long distance provided by deregulation, people would be spending
far more to
talk to each other.


Further, if, in an attempt to "fairly" assess per-minute charges, phone
companies switch to per-minute charges for EVERY call, then that will ONLY
be just if local competition is forced upon them before they can make the
change, so that a company can come in and offer me the same level of service
I\'m receiving now at a competitive rate.


Yet further, FCC officials are appointed by elected officials.  If you
allow, help, or encourage the local companies to get per-minute charges for
Internet usage, I will begin pressuring my elected officials for your firing
in disgrace, at the very least for your removal.

Internet usage already costs too much for what you get out of it.  It\'s a
useful communication tool, and not much more.  It will at one point become
very powerful, but it\'s really still in its infancy.  Only free-market
forces can set its price at the proper level, and we do not have a free
local telephone market yet.  Until we do,

                                 let it be.

Hey Ron,

Just what does bluelight special mean in Canada?

Back on topic,  if the version you are refering to is an adaptation of the
screen play, then you really need to get a copy of the original.  Otherwise,
you\'ll never know what Hollywood left out.

A couple of points to remember, from AM6 (Solomani)  page 5 ...

"In 2118, a minor incident by a Vilani merchant caravan (it ignored traffic
control signals from the Terran base on Bernard) sparked the First
Interstellar War."

As I understand the situation at that time the Vilani had basically STOPPED
expansion of the First Empire.

Bernard was the site of a small Vilani minig base. When the Terrans found
the Vilani in residence, but NOT planting a permanent colony, Terra did, and
claimed the world. I believe from reading AM6 that the Terran claim was
basically ignored by the Vilani, who continued to mine the planet, but also
started to trade with the minor race (Terrans) as a side business.

There were probably a number of minor incidents that occured as the Vilani
calmly continued to work their mines, totally ignoring any Terran authority.
Possibly they even reacted with force when Terran colonists attempted to
"jump their claims". All of this leading to the outbreak of open
hostilities.

In part the start of the Wars was just arrogence. The Vilani were there
first, and were Masters of an Empire spanning thousands of stars. The
Terrans were upstarts from a single system. When the Terran Colony traffic
control ordered the Vilani ships to take up a certain (maybe less desirable)
parking orbit, or to wait while a Terran ship jumped ahead in line, the
Vilani Captain just ignored them.

I\'m pictureing something akin to the "bumping" incedents that occured
between US and USSR naval vessels during the height of the Cold War. Only in
this case an armed Terran ship reacted to the "nudge" or a patrol ship
responded to the deliberate, arrogent ignoring of orders from Traffic
Control, with force. From there things escolated.

Well, Anders,

I guess you are right.  When dealing with anything else that requires this
sort of thing, I always convert to metrics, then back to the original
system.  Example, in my D&D game, the players wanted to know how much wine
they could carry, so I remembered that a gallon is c. 4 liters and that a
liter of most liquids weigh about 1 kg and that 1 kg = c. 2.2 lbs so, I told
them that a gallon of wine weighs 8.5# and made them figure it from there.

No, you can\'t carry a hogshead apiece.  However, with harness and carrying
poles...

Does anyone know how much wine actually weighs?

IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?

I am pleased to present the results of a scientific inquiry into Santa
Claus.

1)  No known species of reindeer can fly.  BUT there are 300,000 species of
living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects
and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only
Santa has ever seen.

2)  There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.  BUT since
Santa doesn\'t (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist
children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million
according to Population Reference Bureau.  At an average (census) rate of
3.5 children per household, that\'s 91.8 million homes.  One presumes there\'s
at least one good child in each.

3)  Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different
time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west
(which seems logical).  This works out to 822.6 visits per second.  This is
to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has
1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney,
fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat
whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the
sleigh and move on to the next house.  Assuming that each of these 91.8
million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we
know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept),
we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2
million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least
once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.

This means that Santa\'s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000
times the speed of sound.  For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made
vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per
second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.

4)  The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.  Assuming
that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds),
the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably
described as overweight.  On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more
than 300 pounds.  Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see point #1) could
pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even
nine.  We need 214,200 reindeer.  This increases the payload - not even
counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons.  Again, for
omparison  - this is four times the weight of the Cunard Lines\' Queen
Elizabeth.

5)  353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air
resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as
spacecraft re-entering the earth\'s atmosphere.  The lead pair of reindeer
will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy.  Per second.  Each.  In
short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the
reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.  The
entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second.
Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times
greater than gravity.  A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim)
would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.

In conclusion - There may have been a Santa Claus, but it is not likely he
ever accomplished everything he\'s purported to have done.

I would like to put the entire Traveller previous to T4 on CD Rom. There are

I have a proposal on my desk to make CT available on line, which I am
evaluating.

For individuals to put scanned versions of these items on line would be a
violation of copyright unless I gave permission. I\'m not inclined to do that
at the moment. I do give permission for scanned covers and some texts for web

I am considering a limited edition photocopy run of JTAS #1 (cover would be
thicker cover stock; all would be in black and white only). The issue would
probably run $10.

It\'s a mistake to extrapolate up from planets to brown dwarfs - brown dwarfs
are, by definition, objects that form like stars (accreting out of 
their own blob of gas), not like planets (small planetesimals in the disk
surrounding a young star sticking together into bigger and bigger planetesimals,
optionally sucking up neighbouring gas once they get big enough.) Brown 
dwarfs are the low end of the star population, not the high end of the
planet distribution.

I think the Hyades is a better place to look, but I\'m prejudiced.

The Pleiades surveys have only found a handful of objects, but that\'s
because they haven\'t covered much space, and the pleiades is fairly diffuse,
and may be depleted of low-mass objects compared to its initial formation.
It\'s certainly consistent with there being about the same number of brown 
dwarfs and late M-dwarfs.

The Pleiades brown dwarfs are field members of their cluster, not companions.
The two all-sky near-IR surveys (DENIS (European) and 2MASS (American) have
begun to find some field objects that they interpret as brown dwarfs
(though I remain skeptical.)

Yes, and to compound the error, the US was reading the Japanese Embassy\'s
cable (telegram) traffic*.  UNfortunately, the translations were fairly bad; 
a recent book compared the translations from US archives with translations 
done by modern scholars.  The lattitude available in translating many of the 
messages was great, and the US translators usually picked the most bellicose 
of the available choices.  This tends to prejudice negotiations.

* This was a standard US practice for most of the interwar years;  This 
  practice was partly responsible for the American success in negotiating 
  the Washington Naval Treaty.

UNfortunately for the Japanese, the tactical commander (Nagumo, I believe)
missed the point, and thought he was done when he\'d sunk as many ships
as he could.  While the destruction of ships and planes was great,
most of the facilities were lightly damaged - in particular, most of the
tank farms were not destroyed, and the bulk of the naval facilities (dry
docks, repair yards, workshops, and submarine facilities) were not
damaged.

This meant that those ships that weren\'t sunk (primarily the carriers)
could continue to operate from Pearl Harbor, and that the ships that were
sunk (with a few exceptions) could be relatively easily raised and put
back in action (many of the battleships that pounded beaches in the latter
part of the pacific war were in fact sunk at Pearl, and later raised).

The failure to destroy the facilities in Pearl Harbor had two primary
effects on the conduct of the war.  Since submarine facilities at Pearl
escaped destruction, war patrols against Japan by the US fleet subs
(arguably the best subs in the war, on any side) could begin immediately+.
The second was that the repair yards at Pearl were back in operation
almost immediately.  Had those repair facilities been destroyed, at least
one of the US carriers that participated in Midway would not have been
present.

+ Unfortunately, the US subs were equipped with (arguably) the worst
  torpedo in the war.  In addition to the magnetic exploder problems that
  it shared with the German torpedo, the US model also had guidance and
  depth-keeping problems.  This means that this advantage was mostly wasted.

Compounding all of this, the Japanese failed to use their submarine forces
(equipped with arguably the best torpedo in the war) to cut the supply
lines from the mainland to Pearl Harbor.

>But I\'m wondering, did some Ziru Sirka commander, beset with Victory
>Disease, make the fatal decision...?

Maybe.  Or maybe it was just translation error.  To use Kenji\'s favorite
trick:

What the Terrans Sent: "Unidentified convoy: identify yourselves and state
your intentions and destination.  Traffic control will give you a
vector and landing instructions.  Show transponders at all times and do
not deviate from the assigned heading."

What the Vilani Recieved: "Convoy not identified: indicate and indicate you 
your intentions and target unit.  The ordering of traffic gives you a vector 
and reports/ratios of landing. The transponders of aspect constantly and do 
not bring back an assigned text of heading 

What the Vilani Sent: "This fleet has not targetted any of your units.  We are a convoy of bulk ore transports with destroyer escort.  We do not recognize your sovergnity over us, and demand immediate clearance to land at our loading 
facility."

What the Terrans Recieved: "This fleet does not have targetted a few its 
units.  We are a convoy the transport of the ore with the escort of the 
destroyer. We do not detect his sovergnity on we and let us not require the 
immediate reduction with abundance with the mass of our facility of 
forwarding.

Things probably went downhill rapidly from there.

Not that I\'ve given this more than a few cursory thoughts, but I was
considering a two track line with the top being capability and the bottom
being damage, something like...
                  
 Lidar  Rate    4       3     2      1      0    
        Damage                                      
                                                   
Each "hit" would be marked in the damage boxes as a slash.  As the hits
accumulate the ability of the device would fall toward zero.  In *this*
case it takes 6 hits to reduce capability one point.  The number of hit
points per hit would vary.  I\'d add that after the damage row is filled the
device isn\'t functioning, additional damage would would be shown by a
backslash in each box..fill the row a second time and the device is
*destroyed* and can\'t be repaired..must be replaced.

Examples of what I mean...
 
 Power  Rate                5  4  3  2    1     0   
 Plant  Damage                                   
                                                 
 The Power Plant takes several points of damage before losing any
 capability, then loses it quickly down to a low level where it
 maintains some function for quite awhile.

 Jump   Rate                      3 0
 Drive  Damage                       
                                     
 The Jump Drive is armored and shielded so it takes many hits with no
 lose of function, but once it\'s damaged enough to affect capability it
 loses it all at once.

As I said, this complicates things, and might not be appropriate for the
"pretzels and beer" version, but I think it *is* doable.

It is supposed to be similar to Full Thrust (which I\'ve never played), and

miniatures.  The vector movement is simple (and simultaneous).  Fighters
and fighter screens are handled a bit more abstractly but again very
simply.  Sensors aren\'t included. Firing is simple and quick.

Even more importantly (for an RPG supplement), there are guidelines for
what player characters can do to change the course of the battle (for
better or worse) depending on their duty station, including task
difficulty levels.

Overall I am very impressed.  The game is fast, simple, and quick to

I have in my hands a copy of the original work by RAH with a new cover
showing a scene from the film published by ACE in the US, isbn
0-441-78359-9, dated May 97 inside the cover.

When I received it I was a little concerned that it was a movie
novelisation, not the original, but it is the original.

Well, we seem to have a complete set of JTAS available. I\'ve got all
but one of them myself (in near mint condition), and other folks have
similar collections, but with different "holes".

I think there\'s a "V3" as well, which is the velocity you *want* to
have when you take off.

I *like* this!

"Charge levels coming up on E1...."

"Coming up on E2....."

"Damn, they hit us..."

"We can\'t abort now!"

"I\'ve got E3!"

"Jump!"

This is just *too* cool sounding to *not* incorporate into the game
mechanics. We\'ll have to work out the details, but I think it\'d cover a
*lot* of "holes". 

E1 = energy level where you *might* be able to jump, but it\'s still
     possible to abort. 

E2 = energy level where you *must* continue onto a jump or else the
     drive and storage units will fail catastrophically.

E3 = energy level level required for a safe jump.

Below E1, jump is not possible. Between E1 and E2 misjump is virtually
certain (treat like jumping inside 10 diameters). Between E2 and E3
misjump is likely (treat like a jump inside of 100 diameters, but
outside 10 diameters). At E3 jump is normal.

What do you think guys?

Being just a *tad* insular there, what! "THE ONLY WAY TO GO" ... well, its
worked so far. But that\'s the *only* battle the Frogs have won -- they lost over
Prime Meridian (runs through Greenwich, London, not Paris), GMT as "Standard"
time, English as international language.

There is, of course, nothing special about metrics. The 10-100-1000 progression
makes it easier, but it didn\'t have to be metrics per se. And, after all, a
*lot* of engineering was done without using it -- and even before it was
invented!

Mr. Electric Stitch or anyone have how to make a Droyne Pc?
Anything that could be used for T4 in a format like the K\'kree

Actually the US and Japan were very near to agreement in the peace talks,
just neither side realised it. The US had demanded that the Japanese get out
of China (meaning only China proper). This was the outcome the Japanese
negotiators were aiming for, but because of a translation problem the
Japanese never understood that the US was willing to let them keep Manchuria.

You have fallen victim to one of the most common misconceptions of Pearl
Harbour. Nagumo had given the flight crews two attack plans, one for if
the carriers were in port and one for if not. If the carriers were in port
half the force was to attack them and the other half the remainder of the
fleet and port; if the carriers were not in port, the aircraft allocated to
the carriers were to attack the port facilities and the others only the fleet.
The first option was to be signalled by the flight leader with two flares
the latter with one. The flight leader fired one flare indicating carriers
not in port but the aircraft allocated to attack the carriers did not see the
flare; therefore he fired another; which was seen by both attack forces. The
results was all the aircraft attacked the fleet and nobody attacked the port
facilities (there has to be some hints for referees in there!)

FIFTH FRONTIER THRUST:
A FULL THRUST CONVERSION FOR STARSHIP COMBAT 
IN THE UNIVERSE OF MARC MILLER\'S TRAVELLER

by Steve Parsonage 10/27/97 -- steve1@i1.net
Written on Microsoft Word Pad 3.2 in .txt format

Introduction:
One of my all-time favorite backgrounds for science fiction gaming is the far future setting of 
GDW\'s Traveller Role Playing Game.  Since I\'m also a big fan of Full Thrust, I decided to go 
about creating a set of rules converting Travellers\' mostly abstract "High Guard" starship 
combat system to Full Thrust.  Most of the weapon systems available to Traveller ships have 
been represented by Full Thrust systems, and ship systems that don\'t apply to the Traveller 
universe have been noted in the text.  Several changes have been made to the capabilities of 
system to better represent Traveller combat (examples:  ships carry large multi-volley missle 
launchers; laser "C" batteries are both offensive and defensive weapons, etc).  These rules 
focus on combat between massive capital ships bristling with dozens of weapons\' batteries.  
Smaller Traveller ships (ie: Millenium Falcon sized) are too small a scale to be detailed here, 
but the author is preparing a set of Traveller small craft rules.  Also included is a brief history
of the Traveller Universe to aid players in designing battle scenarios.
5th Frontier Thrust has not been thoroughly playtested, and the author invites commentary to 
improve these rules.  Feel free to contact steve1@i1.net with your suggestions.
Note: material adapted from the Traveller Universe, formely the property of GDW (now Sweetpea 
Entertainment) is used without permission.  The author has created these rules out of admiration 
and respect for the designers of Traveller, and out of gratitude for the countless hours of 
enjoyment it has provided him.  It is the author\'s intention that these rules help promote the 
play of his two favorite games: Traveller and Full Thrust.

Movement Conversions:
Movement works exactly as it does in full thrust.  Sublight ship drives are called Maneuver 
Drives in Traveller, and only range from 1-6.  FTL drives are called Jump drives, and dictate 
(in parsecs--or, hexes) how far a ship can travel during a 1-week jump, before refuelling.  
According to Traveller convention, solar systems usually occur within 1-3 parsecs of one another.  
Note, Jump Drives have no bearing on the game except during a campaign that the players might 
devise.  They only exist to take up Hull Points on a ship during design.  Most of the ship 
designs listed here have a Jump Rating of 3-6, allowing them to reach most systems at the 
densities at which they occur in Traveller.

System Conversions:
Maneuver Drive:  Unlike Full Thrust, a ship\'s Maneuver rating costs a percentage of ship mass per 
point, regardless of ship type.
Drive Number--          1       2       3       4       5       6
Percentage of Mass:     3       6       9       12      15      18      round fractions up

Jump Drive:  Ship Jump ratings also cost a percentage of ship mass per point, regardless of ship
 type.  All modern capital ships should be built with a rating of 3 or more (Ships w/Jump 1-2 lack
the mobility to respond to enemies w/longer jump ranges, and risk being strategically outmaneuvered.
Drive Number--          1       2       3       4       5       6
Percentage of Mass:     3       4       5       6       7       8       round fractions up
NOTE: when jump drives take damage, reduce them as per maneuver drives in combat.

Fuel Tanks:  Ships require fuel to operate their drives.  A percentage of the ship\'s mass must 
be reserved for fuel use, depending upon the jump rating and maneuver rating.  Fuel tanks are 
partitioned off into boxes and when a threshold check occurs, each box (ie: tank) rolls for 
damage.  When a ship runs out of half of its fuel boxes, it must choose to disengage or fight.  
Ships which stay to fight may no longer disengage.  Ships which run out of fuel are not allowed 
to alter thrust, jump, or fire spinal mount weapons.  
Jump Drive #--  1       2       3       4       5       6
Percentage of Mass:     5       10      15      20      25      30      round fractions up
Maneuver Drive #--      1       2       3       4       5       6
Percentage of Mass:     2.5     3       3.5     4       4.5     5       round fractions up

Number of fuel boxes:  
Escort ships: 2         Cruiser ships: 4                Capital ships:  8

Fighters: Operate as per normal fighters in the rules.  Each individual fighter in a squadron 
represents about 10 actual ships in Traveller scale.  If positioned such that they are in the 
line of fire between a missle firing ship and a friendly ship, the fighter squadron may choose 
to forfeit its normal attack and make a point defense attack to reduce the enemy missles\' 
strength.  Each 5 or 6 rolled reduces the potential damage of the enemy missle volley by 1 
point.  Fighters may intercept incoming missles regardless of the squadron\'s facing.

Systems not available:  Torpedo Fighters, Sensors, ECM, Weasel Decoys, Normal Screens, Normal 
PDAF & ADAF that work vs. fighters, Reflex Fields, Unmodified (ie: non-black globe generator) 
Cloaking Fields

Weapon Conversions:
OFFENSIVE WEAPONS:
Beam Lasers:  C batteries
Energy Weapon barbettes/bays (plasma & fusion beams): B batteries
Particle Accelerator barbettes/bays: A batteries
Meson Accelerator bays:  A batteries that ignore armor, but not meson screens--add 1 mass 
Missle Batteries: Operate as submunition packs.  Instead of one shot weapons, a missle launcher
 is purchased.  The missle batteries come with one submunition pack already loaded.  Additional 
packs may be purchased as ammo racks.  Missle Batteries are bought with firing arcs, just as 
normal A, B, or C batteries:  Launcher:  Mass 2  Cost 2+1/arc;  Ammo rack:  Mass 1  Cost 1.  
Note: ammo racks may resupply any intact launcher on a ship.  Normal submunitions packs are not 
available.
Spinal Mount Particle Accelerator:  Fires a 1" wide particle beam out the front centerline of 
the ship in a straight line.  Requires 1 turn of charging between firings.  There are two sizes 
available: light and heavy.  Ships may have only one spinal weapon.  
Does damage by range as follows:  
                                Heavy:  Mass 10  Cost 25 
Range           0-3             4-12            13-24           25-36           37-48
                5d6             4d6             3d6             2d6             1d6
                                Light:  Mass 5  Cost 12 
Range           0-2             3-6             7-12            13-24           25-36   
                5d6             4d6             3d6             2d6             1d6
Damage rolled is equal to the number on the dice.  Subtract 1 per level of armor encountered 
(all dice do a minimum of one damage).
Spinal Mount Meson Accelerator:  Fires a 1" wide meson beam directly out the front centerline 
of the ship in a straight line.  Unlike the spinal particle beam, the meson beam passes through 
ship armor, and can pass through and damage multiple ships in a straight line, until it encounters 
a target with a functioning meson screen, at which point it stops.  Requires 1 turn of charging 
between firings.  Light and heavy sizes are available.  Ships may only have one spinal weapon.  
Does damage by range as follows:   
                                Heavy:  Mass 12  Cost 40
Range           0-6             7-12            13-24           25-36           37-48
                5d6             4d6             3d6             2d6             1d6
                                Light:  Mass 6  Cost  20
Range           0-2             3-6             7-12            13-24           25-36
                5d6             4d6             3d6             2d6             1d6
Damage rolled is equal to the number on the dice.  Subtract 1 per level of meson screen encountered
 (all dice do a minimum of one damage).

Offensive weapons not available:  Normal Submunitions Packs, Full Thrust Missles, AA Batteries, 
Needle Beams, Pulse Torpedoes, Railguns, Scatterguns, Wave Guns, Nova Cannons

DEFENSIVE WEAPONS:
Beam Lasers:  C batteries may be used as PDAF vs. fighters, and may fire at incoming missle shots 
(ie: submunitions packs).  See "Point Defense Rules" below.
Repulsors:  ADAF, but only vs. missle attacks.  See Below.
Meson Screens:  Operate as normal screens, but only block damage from Meson guns (bays and spinal 
mounts)
Nuclear Dampers:  PDAF, but only vs. missle attacks.  See Below.
Black Globe Generators:  Operates as a cloaking field, except that the ship may not change thrust 
or direction, and may not fire while the field is operating.  Only the number of turns the field 
is on is predetermined.  Mass 1, but only as a rare artifact experimentally installed.
Sandcasters:  Sandcaster batteries fire clouds of anti-laser and energy weapon granules that 
envelop the firing ship.  Each sandcaster battery creates a cloud that acts as a level-1 shield 
versus Laser Beam, Fusion Beam, and Missle Fire (though does not protect against Particle or Meson
 weapons).  A counter is placed next to the firing ship for each sandcaster battery firing, 
representing 1 level of shielding per counter, up to level-3.  Ships may fire through their own 
Sand without penalty.  Sand has the same direction & velocity as the firing ship, and protects 
the ship until it makes a course or speed change, then the sand drifts away and is lost.  The 
ship must get another chance to fire to re-envelop itself with protective sand.  Firing sand 
does not require a fire con.
        Sandcasters:  Mass/level  3       Cost/level  20
Ship Armor:  Can be installed up to level 2, and does require a percentage of the ship\'s mass 
to be installed.  Level-1 = 5% Mass.  Level-2 = 10% Mass.

POINT DEFENSE rules:  
These are modified from normal full thrust.  Nuclear Dampers may "fire" at incoming missle volleys, reducing the potential damage by 1 point per 4 or 5, and 2 points per 6 rolled on each die.  Repulsors may do so at range, just as an ADAF system in full 
thrust.  Roll for each ADAF, 1 point reduced
 for a 4 or 5, 2 points for a 6.
Laser "C" batteries may be fired in a point defense role versus missles, destroying 1 potential damage point on a roll of 6 only.  If a C battery is fired in this way, it may not fire later in the turn, nor may it be used for point defense if it has alre
ady fired this turn.  C batteries may also f
ire against fighter groups in range, again destroying 1 fighter on a roll of 5 or 6 (just as in more thrust).  Remember that firing any number of C batteries in a turn as point defense weapons uses up a fire con for that turn.

Point defense procedure versus incoming "submunition" missles:
1) Declare the missle attack.
2) The attacked ship chooses how many Nuclear Dampers, Repulsors and Laser Batteries he wants to
 commit to shooting down the incoming missles.
3) The attacked ship rolls dice, and totals the number of "potential" damage points negated by 
the point defense.
4) The attacking player rolls his missle dice and does his damage, modifying his roll as per the
 normal rules for each level of obscuring sand.  He then subtracts the point defense total from 
the hits he just inflicted.  Excess hits strike the ship.  Excess point defense is fired and lost 
(not saved from turn to turn)

Traveller Fleet Background Info:
The Traveller Universe is composed of several major empires, the largest of which is the human-
dominated 3rd Imperium.  There have been a number of major wars between these powers, as well 
as many conflict in the Imperium\'s pre-history that are worthy of gameplay, so I\'m also going 
to detail some of the major events in the galaxy\'s past that might be fun to play out.  But 
first, the Traveller empires:
THE (3rd) IMPERIUM:  Centrally located, largest of all the powers.  The Imperium is over 1100 
years old.  After the stagnant first (Vilani-human) imperium was overthrown and replaced by the 
Terran (Solomani-human) second imperium, the long decay of the galactic economy caused a major 
collapse of interstellar civilization, leading to a 1000 year dark age called the Long Night.  
A small cluster of worlds called The Silean Federation survived, and after a slow buildup of 
industrial power, began to expand and recontact the worlds of it\'s predecessors.  After recontacting 
and absorbing about a hundred worlds, the Silean Federation declared itself the 3rd Imperium, 
inheritor of the previous empires\' legacy.  Over the course of a thousand years, the 3rd Imperium
 grew until expanding beyond the borders of its predecessors.  It now contains over 10,000 member
 worlds, maintaining order by allowing its members local autonomy in return for feudal loyalty 
to the Empire, backed by a powerful military.  The Imperium allows its worlds to be free, instead
 controlling the space between the worlds.  The Imperial core is heavily settled, and although 
expansion has stopped (and there are alien empires surrounding the Imperium), the vast border 
regions are still under development as frontiers.  
The Imperial Navy enjoys a slight technological advantage over rival empires, and vast industrial
 resources.  The Navy is structured on a three-level system of command.  At the top is the Imperial
 Fleet itself, consisting of the best ships and crews.  It defends the Imperium from external threats,
 protects the spacelanes, and enforces (when necessary) the will of the Imperial government.  
Supplementing the Imperial Fleet is the Colonial Navy.  Organized by sector, these are 2nd Rate 
ships, funded by regional governments to perform less important duties, and to delay invaders 
until the main Imperial Fleet can respond.  Colonial Forces are composed of older, less mobile 
Cruisers and Battleships, as well as substantial commerce protection forces.  Finally, there 
are the planetary navies.  These are mostly small ships designed for system defense and patrol 
duties (too small to be detailed with these rules).  Occasionally, wealthier planets will 
procure small capital ships, but the Imperium prefers it\'s member worlds to not maintain 
separate battle fleets.  A separate organization, the Scout Service maintains its own fleet of 
ships to explore new worlds, survey the empire, and deliver the mail by express service.  The 
Scouts have a small fleet of older Imperial Cruisers converted for exploration and diplomatic 
duty.
THE ZHODANI CONSULATE:  A race of humans to spinward of the Imperium that is ruled by psionically 
talented elite.  Despite a lack of freedom, the prevalence of telepathic screening prevents 
mental illness or lying in Zhodani culture, creating satisfaction with a society composed of 
a few nobles ruling many "proles".  The Zhodani have fought 5 major wars along the frontier 
with the Imperium (the Frontier Wars) over the developing Spinward Marches Sector.  These wars 
have been mostly inconclusive.  The Zhodani have a large fleet organized along similar lines to 
the Imperium.  Though slightly behind the Imperium in technology, the Zhodani use telepaths to 
efficiently coordinate their battle fleets.  RULE:  The Zhodani may roll 1d6 per firecon they 
possess.  For each one rolled, the Zhodani may either add one to the next turn\'s initiative roll
, or look at one enemy ship\'s movement plot.
THE VARGR EXTENTS:  To coreward of the Imperium lay a vast area of petty states ruled by the 
Vargr.  These are canines, wolves transplanted from Terra and genetically manipulated to intelligence 
by the Ancients for regions unknown.  Though Vargr raiders are daring, they lack long-term 
organizational abilities.  With a pack-mentality, Vargr constantly strive for social dominance, 
and pocket empires rise and fall with the fortunes and charisma of their leadership.  The 
Imperium suppressed Vargr raiding early on during it\'s expansion in a series of small wars 
called "The Vargr Pacification Campaigns".  During each of the frontier wars, individual Vargr 
states have been induced by the Zhodani to strike the Imperium along its flank.  Vargr Navies 
are often composed of mercenary Corsair squadrons, who use plunder to finance capital ship 
development.  There are some larger Vargr powers though, who have significant fleet assets.
THE ASLAN HIERATE:  The Aslan are vaguely reminiscent of Terran lions (or rather lion-men), and 
dominate a large area to spinward and rimward of the Imperium.  The 29 clans of the Hierate seek 
to expand feudal land holdings for their male leadership, while its administration and economy 
are run by the technically-minded Aslan females.  Aslan expansion is limited by conflicts between 
clans, and by the Imperium, who fought a series of border wars against them in the Imperial years 
400-500.  Each of the clans maintains its own Fleet.  There are many more splinter clans that 
maintain fleets, but lack capital ships.
THE SOLOMANI SPHERE:  Located rimward to the Imperium, the Solomani Sphere is dominated by humans 
originating from the Sol system (ie: Terra).  Originally the sphere was a province of the Imperium 
allowed to develop independently.  The Sphere expanded to rimward and governed its worlds without 
oversight from the Imperial government.  When these worlds complained to the Empress that the 
Solomani were racists, enforcing a code of racial superiority of "True" Terran Humans, she 
revoked their charter.  The Solomani seceeded from the Empire and war broke out in the late 
1000s.  The Solomani Rim War began with an invasion of Imperial space that was eventually 
repelled with heavy losses.  The Imperium began a two-pronged invasion of the Sphere, aimed at 
capturing Terra.  After a costly siege, Terra was conquered, but neither power could afford to 
continue the pitched fighting.  A ceasefire was signed that has lasted ever since.  Today 
relations are outwardly tense, but the need for trade between the two powers maintains a 
fairly stable peace.  The Solomani Sphere maintains a sizeable fleet, slightly less advanced 
than the Imperium, but lacking the vast industrial resources of their neighbor.
THE HIVER CONFEDERATION:  Located to trailing and rimward of the Imperium, the Hivers are a 
technologically advanced, insatiably curious race of quadrepedal/starfish like aliens.  They 
have had no notable conflicts with the Imperium, although tensions exist with the bordering 
Solomani Sphere.  The Hivers, while peaceful, maintain a navy after experiencing a bloody 
conflict with the K\'Kree to coreward.  The Hivers are masters of advanced computer technology, 
and social sciences.  In the face of the militant K\'Kree navy, the Hivers forced a peace by 
threatening to use Psychohistory techniques (a la the Foundation series) to fundamentally 
change the K\'Kree culture.  The socially rigid xenophobic K\'Kree backed down.  The Hiver fleet 
is designed to protect the borders, protect merchant ships, and explore the frontiers.
THE K\'KREE:  Called Centaurs by humans due to their resemblance to the creatures of Terran 
legend, the K\'Kree are separated from the Imperium to trailing by a large number of small human 
and alien client states.  The K\'Kree Empire is called the Two-Thousand Worlds after the number 
of stars visible in the night sky on their homeworld.  The K\'Kree are intelligent herbivorous 
grazers, who crave social contact, open spaces (they\'re claustrophobic), and the safety of the 
herd.  Early in their history, their world was invaded by a race of carnivores.  The K\'Kree 
defended their world and exterminated the invaders.  The realization that other carnivores 
might exist in space motivated them to control the stars.  As they encounter new races, they 
force them to conform to K\'Kree society.  If the aliens refuse to become Herbivores with a herd 
mentality, the K\'Kree ruthlessly exterminate them.  They have fought one war with the Hivers, 
which they lost when the Hivers threatened to use Psychohistory to fundamentally change K\'Kree 
society.  K\'Kree ships are larger than normal, to prevent claustrophobia-induced insanity in their 
crews.  The Navy is run by a Leader "caste" and staffed by the "Warrior" caste.  There is no 
division between ground and space services.
THE DARRIAN CONFEDERATION:  is a small cluster of worlds located between the Zhodani and Imperium.  
They are a minor human race that developed ultra-high technology during the long night.  An 
accident destroyed their civilization, but now they command a few powerful artifacts that keep 
them autonomous from either power.  The are presently allied with the Imperium, against their 
neighbor, the Sworld Worlds.  They otherwise maintain a small fleet with a lower technology 
than the Zhodani or Imperium.
THE SWORD WORLDS: is a small client state on the Imperial Border founded during the long night. 
 The Sword Worlds are fiercely independent, often fractious, but when unified have allied with 
the Zhodani against the Imperium.  The Sword Worlds maintain a small fleet of captial ships that 
are significantly technologically inferior to the Imperium\'s.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TRAVELLER UNIVERSE:
300,000 years ago, a race of beings known only as the Ancients, controlled this area of the galaxy. 
 For reasons unknown, they transplanted primitive humans from their home planet of Terra to over
 100 worlds in the region.  Three of these human races eventually discovered the secret to the Jump 
Drive and founded galactic empires.  The first were the Vilani (homeplanet: Vland) who slowly 
developed a stable, but socially rigid caste based interstellar society.  The rigidity of the 
Vilani social system to change led them to force differing alien races on their borders to conform 
to the Vilani order.  Between 1000BC and 2100 AD, the Vilani conquered all their neighbors, ordered 
the halt to all "dangerous" technological innovation, and turned inward.  They closed the borders of 
their stagnating empire until suddenly contacted by human aliens along their frontier.
In 2100 AD, the nations of Earth had become unified under a UN based world government and had 
collectively discovered the secret to the Jump Drive.  They were surprised to find that the 
first aliens they contacted were humans calling themselves "Vilani".  They were alarmed to 
discover that the Vilani already owned the entire galatic arm.  Peaceful relations broke down 
during disputes over Terran economic expansion, and over the next 200 years, innumerable wars 
were fought between the upstart Terrans and the corrupt, inefficient Vilani Empire.  Eventually 
the Vilani surrendered to the Terran Navy, who declared a new Second Empire, the joint "Rule of 
Man".  The Terrans tried to stop the decay of of the First Imperium by introducing Terran social 
ideas, but it didn\'t work.  The Interstellar economy was disrupted by too much social change too 
fast, and slowly fell apart.  After 300 years of trying to prevent the First Empire from collapsing, 
the Second Empire itself fell apart.  The resulting 2000 year dark age, in which interstellar trade 
all but stopped, was called the Long Night.
The Long Night ended when a small group of trading worlds in the galactic core, the Sylean 
Federation, began rebuilding itself into an industrial powerhouse.  Under the leadership of 
Cleon Zhunastu, the Sylean Federation either defeated its rivals, or economically enticed others 
into joining it.  After swelling to a size of 100+ worlds, Cleon declared himself Emperor, 
founding the Third Imperium on the ashes of its predecessors.  Cleon\'s Imperium used Feudalism 
to control the vast distances between worlds.  Worlds were mostly left to govern themselves.  
They need only swear loyalty to the Imperium, and follow certain basic rules.  The Imperium 
controlled the space between the stars (and the profitable interstellar trade).  Over the next 
1100 years, The Imperium expanded beyond the borders of it\'s predecessors, until stopped by 
foreign powers, or lack of desire to expand the vast frontier.  Today, in the 57th century AD, 
The Imperium contains over 10,000 worlds, is home to scores of sentient races, and has fought 
wars with all of its neighbors.  On the surface, Imperium is the most stable empire in all of 
human history, though the seeds of Imperial assassination and factional Civil War lie just 
around the corner...

Ship Designs:
A note on ship classes:  most commercial and patrol vessels are small (averaging 400 MT of 
hydrogen displacement--The Millenium Falcon masses 200 MT).  Fleet escort vessels and destroyers
 average at least 1000-8000 MT of hydrogen.  Light Cruisers start at about 20,000 MT, and Cruisers 
average 50,000 MT, about 1/4 the size of a Star Destroyer in Star Wars.  In Traveller, Cruisers 
are very large ships which are capable of carrying spinal mount weapons, the standard heavy 
armament for fleet actions.  Thus, the disparity in size between escorts and cruisers is very 
great.  I have used a conversion rate of 1 Mass = 500 MT/1 DP per 1000 MT.  The following is a 
revised ship class chart:

When designed, ships start with all mass available to fill with weapons AND drive/fuel systems. 
Thus ships with poor drive performance can be fitted with more weapons, and ships with better 
range and drive ability have to be stocked with less weaponry.

SAMPLE SHIPS:  
These ship designs have been adapted from Classic Traveller Supplement 9: Fighting Ships.  They 
are representative of the ship classes available to the Imperial Navy in the period immediately 
before the start of the Second Civil War.  Ship designs from the other races in Traveller, being 
rare and hard to find, are left open to the players\' interpretation.

   Then he is crazy...like a fox.  He knew instinctively that *nobody*
conducts a frontal assault against storm troopers unless they have numbers
on their side.  The storm troopers also know this fact, which is why when he
charged, they turned and run.

   IIRC, Han soon realizes that it will only be a matter of time before the
stormtroopers figure out his ruse.  Sure enough they did, but not before he
bought the other PCs err..I mean the rest of his group valuable time to
escape.  Han being Han, he also gets away without a scratch.

I would certainly buy such a CD-ROM, since I recently got started playing
Traveller, and only have access to T4 rulebooks and supplements. Having
more background material, milleus and other stuff would be great.

Also a good thing. I doubt it will gain many new players, but the existing
players would be very happy about this.

Would the CD-ROM include Traveller material from JTAS and other magazines ?

Uh, try never. The Genoee (sp?) and the Surreat (sp?) _seemed_ to
have discovered Jump on their own, but it was later uncovered that
that had copied Ancient relic drives. Thus the major race - minor race 
dichotomy was born.

This is not to say that the Vilani and Terrans didn\'t copy it 
themselves - they simply managed to hide the fact. 

I suppose the First Imperium had already encountered the Vargr
and maybe the K\'kree (I don\'t have my stuff to check right now..)
but they sure as heck didn\'t conquer them.

Indeed. 

Also, it seems that Terrans and Vilani are much more similar than
(Terrans|Vilani) and members of most other minor human races, for
example, the Surreat and Genoee. How many monir human races did the
Vilani meet that were interfertile with themselves before they met the
Terrans? Possibly none, or certainly none that were as advanced as the 
Terrans.

Just putting my two penny\'s in.

This is from the star wars technical manual.

"At the time of Solo\'s first encounter with Kenobi and Skywalker, the FALCON\'S
greatest claim to fame was that she was the ship that held the completion record
for the Kessel Run, something of a smuggler\'s speed and endurance contest. Those
ship\'s hired to make the run must deliver specified loads of certain substances
(usually spice from the mine of Kessel) to a number of moving trade ships before
they all pass beyond the limits of the free trade lanes near the planet."

So you could quote the distance you had travelled to get to all the trade ships.

I was always of the understanding that they were so big that each colony
only had one, and control of them was almost heriditary.

OK, at the risk of sounding really stupid, what is M.P.D.?

>Shuttlecraft compliment: 8

Hmmm.  I\'d alway\'s figured more.  I thought the standard compliment of
Vipers was ~80.  I also thought that with the number lost due to the ambush
of the fleet, and a lack of fuel to meet up with the Galactica that they
ended up with less than a full complement even with the surviving pilots of
the other Battlestars.  On that Token, the Pegasus did have pretty much a
full compliment when they ran into each other, and I believe the Galactica
ended up with most or all of them.

As for shuttles, I\'ve not idea, but 8 sounds reasonable.

>Length Overall: 3,280 d.m

Again at the risk of sounding stupid, what is a \'d.m\'?

Anyone have any figures on the crew size of either the Galactica, or a Base
Star?  For that matter, any estimates on the number of Cylon Raiders

Sorry, but Avoirdupois  *is* "Imperial". 1 oz =28.35 grams, 16 oz to
the pound. 

In *Troy* weight (used for precious metals), there are 12 oz to the
pound. But the ounces are a different size! Around 35 grams as I recall.

So a "pound" of iron and a "pound" of silver *don\'t* weigh the same if
you are using the "default" type of pound for each!

As I note, different size ounces, not merely a different *number*!

See above mention of escort support.

I built this design based on the canonical mention of 90,00ton BBs.  This
called for compromise.  In playtests (using a BL/Mayday fusion) Royals have
acquitted themselves with great honor.

I *eagerly* await your design for a TL12 90kton battleship.

Well, you see, that\'s the "trick" with transponders. They see your
radar pulse (or traffic control\'s) and respond by "echoing" it along
with a "piggyback" of their ID/altitude (in current models).

So you get the effect of someone flicking on their "headlights" when
they see your "headlights" sweep across them. 

I expect that in the Traveller universe, STC(Space Traffic Control)
will be doing something like we see in C.J. Cherryh\'s Chanur series.
That is, broadcasting a "display" of the system as they see it,
including ship locations and types. 

Since they\'ll have *much* better radar than you do, this will be
*better* than what you\'ll get by running your radar, except for *close*
objects/ships. 

It also provides a nice touch in wartime. Either they shut it down, or
they run it encrypted so their side can read it and the other side can\'t.
Another nasty trick is to "edit" the display to omit lurking warships.

Actually, I think RTGs will be fairly widespread, though, as you note,
they\'ll definitely be a "niche" technology. 

They are perfect for "stationary" applications where you need a
*reliable* power source with a long life and very low (zero!)
maintenance.

Given the fact that the folks a few centuries from now don\'t seem to
have the *unreasonable* fears of "nuclear" whatever that are common
now, I can see them being a normal item of commerce. And they are also
a handy way to deal with nuclear wste. Seperate it and *use* it, rather
than just bury it somewhere.

So I\'d expect to see them as "emergency" power on planetary and
asteroid installations (where you can use a few meters of rock as
shielding). And I\'d even expect to see them as the *primary* power
source for some uses. Nav beacons for one. And some types of colonies
and mining settlements might use them, again because they don\'t need
fuel or maintenance.

Heck, just consider how many folks in isolated areas *now* would go for
a power source that would work regardless of the weather, need no fuel
or maintenance, and havbe a power output that drops on a smooth curve
to 50% after a number of *years* (say 40 or so). No worries about
parts. No downed lines, or busted generator. Just a concrete box a few
dozen meters from the building, with a *buried* power cable. Sure in 50
to 100 years your kids will want to swap out the unit for a new one. So
what?

And yes, there are units with shorter and longer half-lives.

But for "frontier" installations, I think they\'ll compete well with
fusion merely from the *maintenance* point of view. And I\'d damn well
rather have an RTG supplying the power for the lights, heat and air,
even if I had the fusion unit to run the stuff that takes real power.

Of course, a lot depends on the relative *cost*, but I still think the
long life would make the RTG come out ok in many cases.

This strikes me as an interesting progression...massive population drop
and conversion from single world government to balkanization.  Given that
the tech continued to be state-of-the-art, I\'d guess a relatively
nondisruptive, drawn-out disaster...plague, perhaps, in humans or food
crops...?

Another population die-back and conversion to balkanization...what\'s the

Makes you wonder why Zurrian wasn\'t the original mainworld.  My guess is
that there was a particularly hostile ecosystem there, which higher tech
made manageable.

One has to wonder why the starport has never been upgraded...or was it
upgraded then destroyed at some point?  Perhaps terrorism connected with
breaking away from Vland?

They aren\'t.  My ruling has always been that A ports have the prevailing
maximum tech or one less regardless of the hosting world, all in a
relatively isolated clump within and just outside the extrality fence. 
Shipbuilding capacity will be seriously limited where the \'port tech\' is
far above local tech, due to parts and skill shortages, but such a port
can still build a few small vessels a year, if need be.

Such \'tech-isolated\' A (and B) ports are in practical terms rated for
their fuel supply, maintenance facilities, cargo-handling capacity, and
other starship support services.  Shipbuilding is a sideline.  In some
cases there\'s just barely enough ship construction in progress to get a
Vilani/Newt bureaucrat team to certify it\'s going on, in order to nab the
coveted \'A\' rating. :)  Rumor has it that some remote, underpopulated
A-starport worlds have had the same ships \'under construction\' for
decades, dutifully inspected by many generations of Imperial officials
during port certification review...

Obviously, Tauri is unlikely to be building *many* ships at the time of
the VCTI;  instead, they\'ll be built elsewhere and sent into the region.

Me too!

Imports of high-tech *goods* aren\'t the primary goal on Tauri.  Those that
are needed will be handled by the 1/5 of subsidized merchants expected to
run the loop \'backward\'.  Also recall that Guuiish *is* six tech levels
higher than Tauri, and that Guuiish tech may be just the *right*
stepping-stone for Tauri\'s culture during the recovery process.  It\'s a
lot easier to train someone to maintain (and later build) an
internal-combustion engine than a CG lifter, after all. 

> 	Well its not our problem, we have just to build the ships.

Spoken like a true government contractor! :)

But the IISS Guard?  Simple logic has them drawing ammo from a different
supply than the Imperial Guard Regiments.  These guys are supposed to be
the final line of defence for the personage of the Emperor!  It would be a
damning condemnation of the state of the Imperial Household if security was
so lax as to allow Dulinor to learn which 12-sophont detail was to be in
the Throne room that day, along with pictures so the Illelish Guard could
pick them off.

If I were on that detail, the moment the first shot went off, my first
thought would be "the Grand Princess is in the room."  Insure the safety of
the line, since the Emperor has probably been hit already.  Six men grab
Iphengia and run like hell, while the other six die slowing down Dulinor
and his men.  Hell, spray the crowd with gunfire if necessary, the
situation has already gone to absolute shit.

Now there\'s an interesting alternate..  Empress Iphengia, taking the throne
as a young woman, and leading a United Imperium against the abortive Second
Illelish Revolt.

I was very interested in this conversion until I found out that a 60k ton

500kton Dreadnought (Tigress).

This is a bit of a problem.

Metric units are not necessarily more \'intuitive\' than other units.  That\'s
not the advantage of metric units.  The advantage is that the units are all
decimal, so scaling is simply a matter of moving the decimal point.  Also,
the base units measure intrinsic properties (mass, length, time) instead
of extrinsic properties (specifically: weight) so they are more useful in
scientific calculations (more useful = simpler).

People can get used to anything but will most likely find the units they
grew up with more \'intuitive\' because they are more used to them.

Not that I\'ve given this more than a few cursory thoughts, but I was
considering a two track line with the top being capability and the bottom
being damage, something like...
                  
 Lidar  Rate    4       3     2       1     0    
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        Damage | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                
Each "hit" would be marked in the damage boxes as a slash.  As the hits
accumulate the ability of the device would fall toward zero.  In *this*
case it takes 6 hits to reduce capability one point.  The number of hit
points per hit would vary.  I\'d add that after the damage row is filled the
device isn\'t functioning, additional damage would would be shown by a
backslash in each box..fill the row a second time and the device is
*destroyed* and can\'t be repaired..must be replaced.

Examples of what I mean...
 
 Power  Rate               5  4  3  2    1     0   
 Plant          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                  
        Damage  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |                                  
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                
 The Power Plant takes several points of damage before losing any
 capability, then loses it quickly down to a low level where it
 maintains some function for quite awhile.

 Jump   Rate                       3 0
 Drive          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        Damage  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
                                     
 The Jump Drive is armored and shielded so it takes many hits with no
 lose of function, but once it\'s damaged enough to affect capability it
 loses it all at once.

As I said, this complicates things, and might not be appropriate for the
"pretzels and beer" version, but I think it *is* doable.

   When you consider that the crew of a spacecraft can\'t exactly surface and
open a hatch to get some fresh air (not healthy for a U-boat after 1943
either, but you know what I mean), I estimate the figures I came up with are
probably about as cramped as you want to go on a routine basis.

   And 18 if you have three shifts and use "hot bunking".  ;-)

   Or any government desperating trying to win naval superiority with few
capital vessels to speak of, and no way to fight a coordinated surface action.

   We know that the Terrans used TL 12 robots on their warships during the
Interstellar Wars (probably from the 8th on).  These would have probably
performed routine maintenance tasks only, replacing some low ranking
personnel who would have to have been relatively closely supervised anyway.

   By the Modern ("Imperial") Era, we are told that such functions that
could be handled by robots are performed within the "box" (the computer
systems and electronics) itself.  This explains why robots are not routinely
used on naval vessels (or merchants for that matter) in the Third Imperium.
Near sentient intelligent robots were being tested by the navy as
replacements for humans as pilots and other for other tasks, but that
testing ceased with the Rebellion.

   In the Post-Modern ("New") era, fears of Virus infestation would prohibit
the use of the kind of automated systems employed by the Third Imperium.  On
the other hand, it would also prohibit the use of robots as well (trust of
mechanical devices that can move independently being in short supply).  This
explains why New Era crews have to be so much larger.

   Your table could work for cultures outside the Third Imperium however,
including perhaps the Solomani.

Quite true.  On top of the translation problem that the Japanese had (which
prevented them from realizing how close the two sides were), the US had a
translation problem which led them to believe that the Japanese were
being deliberately difficult.

> [Confusion of attack signals at Pearl Harbor]

I know about that.  However, after the initial attacks, the strike commander
(Genda, I think, but my memory may be playing tricks on me) specifically
mentioned to Nagumo that the base facilities were not adequately destroyed,
and recommended an additional strike (aircrew, aircraft, and ordinance
were available).  Nagumo declined to execute the strike - at least IMHO
placing the failure to destroy the facilities squarely on his shoulders.

Nagumo\'s primary reason was that the location of the US carriers was unknown,
and he didn\'t want to risk his fleet to a counterstrike from them.  He was 
not critisized for this decision in Japan, although some postwar books 
(written by both sides) have been critical of this decision.

ObTraveller: Would the Vilani mindset in the early Interstellar Wars have
been similar?  Risking valuable ships (and therefore one\'s career) to achieve
total destruction of the enemy may not be percieved as worthwhile,
particularly when you have already achieved a significant victory simply on
the number of enemy ships damaged and destroyed.

   One wonders what would have happened if the Japanese had sided with the
Allies instead of the Axis in WW II.  Remember that they gained a
considerable amount of territory when they assumed control of Germay\'s
Pacific island colonies after the Treaty of Versailles.

   Imagine Japan in 1960 with the H-bomb, a navy as large as any other in
the world, territory that includes Korea, Manchuria, Taiwan, and a good
chunk of the western Pacific, with trade deals that give them access to
Indonesian and Arab oil, and markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere.

   Assuming of course they didn\'t lose it all in a nuclear war with the
Soviets...

   According to my timeline (as in the one I established for my campaign),
the Terrans detect the prescence of the Vilani much earlier than this.  A
SETI II site in Siberia first detects Vilani transmissions in 2047.  This
fact is kept secret from the general population until after the Interstellar
Wars begin.  Knowledge of the Vilani helps to explain the sudden increases
in government spending on aerospace research and exploration worldwide after
that date.

>The US Space Force dispatched

>to investigate.

   As a point of Traveller canon, Star Leaper I, an American vessel, is the
first ship to make contact with the Vilani.  It leaves Terra just before the
expedition to Alpha Centauri (IIRC, an ESA mission).  The Americans make
first contact with the Vilani, and then quietly return back to Earth using
the hoopla over the discovery of Prometheus as a cover.

   According to my timeline, things were done that way on purpose.  Had the
Americans left for Barnard and returned without the Prometheus mission as
cover, the public and the mass media would have much more closely
scrutinized the mission results.  As it was, a cover story was fabricated
(complete with phoney crew logs) and no one outside a few government
officials in the major powers was the wiser.

   According to Traveller canon, knowledge of the results of the mission to
Barnard were kept secret for 20 years, enough time to prepare the public for
the shock of the knowledge that most of local space was claimed by landlords
many, many parsecs away, and human ones at that.

   In my timeline, the time was spent quietly preparing for war, or at least
the possibility of it.  The Terrans realized from their listening in on the
Vilani for the past 50+ years that the Vilani Empire (what they called the
\'Ziru Siirka\') was so vast, and had so many resources that conflict was a
very distinct possibility if the Terrans were to grow too powerful for
Vilani comfort.  Through "cultural exchanges" with the Vilani, the Terrans
were also able to find out what happened to worlds that became a
threat--they were absorbed (forget the fact that the Vilani at the local
level were in no condition to invade a high population world and were
unlikely to get approval for it from above in any event).  The perception of
threat was enough to unite the Terrans in common cause.

   I would love to see something official along those lines, and I have done
a great deal of speculation myself, but other than the EU and the United
States, no specific details were ever given about what conflicts or factions
that might exist on latter 21st century Earth, other than some vague
references to battles over Europa and some other moon IIRC.

   This seems unlikely since the Terrans were clearly not ready for what
followed.  While the Terrans certainly standing up for their rights (IIRC,
Barnard was actually outside Vilani space) as claimants to the system, they
in no way actually tried to stop the Vilani from mining there.   I believe
that the the original canon explanation, a simple dispute that turned ugly
and escalated out of control with no one really at fault is the best one.

   This of course is not to say that the Terrans didn\'t have war hawks
amongst them, or that there wasn\'t actually a plan to take on the Vilani
eventually.

I\'m glad to see that at least on person "got it" so I can quit beating this

and apothecary.  They are fundamentally different in what is weighed and
relative weights.  That is the last thing I will say on the topic.

It wasn\'t *just* Iphengia, it was Valerian being killed by Lucan at the
same time...just too darn coincidental.  Oh well, it coulda happened that
way, shouldn\'t have, but coulda.

The civil war could have been played out over several years and then wound
down.  I would have liked to have seen the Imperium broken into a half
dozen large states, each a few sectors in size.  Along with the Zhodani,
Sword Worlders, Aslan and Vargr States we\'d have ended up with a
multi-polar quadrant with all kinds of wonderful possibilities.  Put
Iphengia on the throne of a shrunken Imperium around Core, Norris out in
the Marches, Dulinor among the Illelish, Margie behind the veil, an
expanded Solomani presence around Sol, etc...etc.  

Imagine all the possibilities! ;->

Yep, that pretty well sums it up! Proof that movie directors do hallucinogenics.
(Of course, Verhoven is the man who did "Show Girls", IIRC, thus, I rest my
case).

"Wha\' tactics, we don\' need nuh stink\'in tac\'tics!".

Though, the black humor was deffinitely some of the best highlights of the
film, and the FX 
were impressive, to say the least. Overall, I enjoyed the movie for what it
was(?)-entertaining.
(Gawd-it hurt me to say that!)

Well, I\'ll be re-reading Heinlein\'s version soon, and then I\'ll be cleansed
of Verhoven\'s sacrilege

You forgot the problem with the impact detonators not working on "head

Nice work!  Well put together and nicely organized.  One suggestion:  just
grab the Web Ring graphic from some where and put it directly on the page..
that thing never loads correctly otherwise.

Nice design.  One question: since I assume that the command varient will be
used to control squadrons of these ships, wouldn\'t a radio and shorter
range lascoms be more useful?

Moreover - Imperial Squadrons states "Coronations are found at the heart of
Imperial Battle Squadrons. Operating in teams of two, with supporting
cruisers and destroyers....  ....powerful as these ships are, a battleship
caught without support is considered an easy kill."

So you are only likely to see a Coronation within the context of a full
squadron - hopefully there won\'t be any Prince of Wales and Repulse type
operations with these ships.

Additionally, I took M0 to imply that the Imperium had few real enemies
capable of meeting their might directly.

I kinda got he impression that they look like the Pierson\'s Puppeteers
(created by Larry Niven).  As for poses, go to any barnyard and look at the
cows for inspirations.  :-)  Those would be the city K\'ree.  For your more
independant/rural types, a good source would be wild ruminants like the
bison (America buffalo, if there are any still wild).

Here\'s a stick figure "drawing."  If you want to see what some real artists

It has all kinda cool/neato stuff including links and a Larry Niven Web

Without it sounding like a smart as*ed question, where does this info come
from? Is it part of the Rats and Cats book? Alien 6 Solomani does not make
any mention of hiding the Vilani presence for 20 years, nor does it imply
that the Prometheus exploration occured concurrently with the Barnard
mission, in fact it states that Barnard was chosen instead of Alpha Centuri.
It did return early and somewhat secretly to inform the UN of the Vilani
presence. Following that report (again according to AM 6) "...joint UN
expeditions were quickly launched - to meet and deal with the Vilani on
Barnard and later on the Vilani-settled worlds of Nusku and Gashidda, and to
explore the as yet unsettled worlds of Alpha Centauri. A quick effort was
also made to settle Barnard even as Vilani prospectors were working that
world."

If all of this was later expanded on or changed by "Rats and Cats" (a book I
regretfuly do not have) please let me know. It\'ll mean modifying some of the
early history of my own campagn setting,

Actually, going by what\'s know of US Secret Service guard detail
routine, there will several agents assigned *exclusively* to each
member of the Imperial family on any given shift. 

Their *sole* duty is to protect *that* person. So Iphengia\'s guards
would grab her at the first sign of trouble. Ditto for the Guards on
the other members of the family.

This setup is so that there will always be someone who is responsible
for a given "target" and who *won\'t* be conflicted by having to worry
about the other targets.

Likewise, there\'s going to be someone (more likely *several* in crowd
like the Throne room) whose duty is to *report* the attack *before*
doing anything. That way the guard details elsewhere in the palace will
start dragging their charges to safety *then*.

This means that getting a "clean sweep" of the Emperor *and* the heirs 
requires incredible synchronization. 

Several of Clancy\'s "Jack Ryan" novels go into some detail about this
sort of thing. And "Patriot Games" goes into a bit about how the
British protect some sites such as the Tower of London.

About the same as water.

And there\'s a "rule of thumb" that helps. "A pint\'s a pound, the world
round". That is, a pint of water weighs about a pound. 

Some useful conversion factors (these are *exact* figures, for the US
version of the "English" system):

  1 inch = 25.4 mm (legal definition)
 1 ounce = 28.35 g (legal definition)
1 gallon = 231 cubic inches (legal definition?)

These three figures cover a *lot* of things. Knowledge of the standard
rules for length, weight and volume under the American system will let
you cover almost anything.

Mass is absolute. Weight is mass times local gravity. So if two objects
have the same mass they\'ll have the same weight. If one has twice the
mass of the other, it\'ll also have twice the weight.

Of course, in zero g they both weigh nothing.

Not that I\'ve given this more than a few cursory thoughts, but I was
considering a two track line with the top being capability and the bottom
being damage, something like...
                  
 Lidar  Rate    4       3     2       1     0    
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        Damage | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                
Each "hit" would be marked in the damage boxes as a slash.  As the hits
accumulate the ability of the device would fall toward zero.  In *this*
case it takes 6 hits to reduce capability one point.  The number of hit
points per hit would vary.  I\'d add that after the damage row is filled the
device isn\'t functioning, additional damage would would be shown by a
backslash in each box..fill the row a second time and the device is
*destroyed* and can\'t be repaired..must be replaced.

Examples of what I mean...
 
 Power  Rate               5  4  3  2    1     0   
 Plant          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                  
        Damage  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |                                  
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                
 The Power Plant takes several points of damage before losing any
 capability, then loses it quickly down to a low level where it
 maintains some function for quite awhile.

 Jump   Rate                       3 0
 Drive          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        Damage  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
                                     
 The Jump Drive is armored and shielded so it takes many hits with no
 lose of function, but once it\'s damaged enough to affect capability it
 loses it all at once.

As I said, this complicates things, and might not be appropriate for the
"pretzels and beer" version, but I think it *is* doable.

Traditionally, Vilani fashion features draped headdresses, and flowing
lines, similar to Bedouin or Mongolian clothing.  Higher classes/ranks wore
sleeves and mittens that covered the hands, since the upper crust had
servants to do the work for them.

I did a write up of Vilani soldiers once (pre-computer, so it\'s long gone),
as I recall, I put the rank on a vambrace (fore-arm guard.)

Think of a horse with two arms coming out of the forequarters.  That\'s a
vague idea, but pretty close.

>3.  Vargar fashions (male and female)

Well, Since Vargr color eye-sight is very poor, the colors tend to be
*bright* and clash.  Vargr seem to enjoy militaristic accessories, like
braid, medals, cords and the like.

>4.  K\'ree fashions and cermonial armour

K\'kree tend to go nude.  Their warriors wear a flanged helmet when doing
ceremonial work.  The mane is clipped according to caste: full hair for
nobles, top of head shaved for Merchants, shaved bald for the Servants.
IIRC, K\'kree go in for jewelry.

>5.  Aslan military uniforms

Ornate.  Usually covered in Trokh (the male script), and probably very
customized.  I doubt that Aslan ground forces would have much of a uniform
beyond clan/family symbols.

>6.  Zhodani unifroms and fashions (dose every one were the rags on their
heads or what?)

Only nobles wear the turban.  Since Zhodani are human, anything that
humanity has done on Earth will probably have happened on Zhdant.  Except
Punk/Grunge..  I can\'t imagine the Tavrchedle condoning that!  We really
don\'t know that much about Zhodani military uniforms beyond the
oft-depicted Combat Armor, with its clam-shell helmet and scalloped breast
plate.

A Hiver examining something would be typical.

The three det laser missiles will do well against ships without
sophisticated point defenses (eg civilians or a civilian turned pirate).

The laser just isnt big enough to hurt anything with heavier armour than
the absolute minimum. The fixed mount will make it more difficult to use as
a point defense weapon against inbound missiles as well.

You might also play with dropping the MFD and investing in more missiles -
the problem with missiles isnt hitting once they get to their 15 000 km
range, it\'s achieving that range in the face of enemy laser and
counter-missile fire. This means you need to saturate the target with more
missiles than they can deal with.

Electrostatic armour is good against HEAP warheads and fusion beams, but
ineffective against PAWs and lasers. The ESA will help if the fighter is in
the atmosphere, playing against grav tanks and such, but wont do a lot in
space.

Personally, I think Mil Black hulls and EMM are not cost effective - normal
passive sensors still detect you at lightsecond ranges. But thats just a
personal view.

Congrats on the design and posting it - it\'s a good low-end dual-role
fighter for space and atmosphere work.

Mass is a measure of how much stuff is there.  It is used to calculate
things like kinetic energy, potential energy, inertia, etc...

Weight is a measure of how hard something is being pulled on by gravity.

An object\'s mass never changes.

Weight varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field.

Since the weight (force pulling on an object) and the inertia (resistance
to acceleration) are both proportional to mass, all objects fall at the
same acceleration (the mass term cancels out).

There are some non-newtonian effects that supposedly affect this, but
I\'m not sure what they are and they are negligible compared to the
newtonian effects.

The relationship between hexsize and turnlength if 1 hex of velocity change

As the number of turns increase the relative difference between distance
travelled using Mayday scales (s = at^2) approaches the textbook formula (s
0 (1/2)at^2) and as the Mayday pieces graphically simulates the ships
velocity which should be computed with the formula v = at the scale is
correct right?

Right, I\'ve got Mayday in front of me now. It says:

"If sandcasting is performed, missile launch is not allowed." Hmm. Maybe
that explains how the sand is launched from a turret yet surrounds the
ship... you spin the ship while firing, which spreads the sand about but
breaks your missile locks. OK if your inertial compensators are online,
otherwise reach for the barf bag... or maybe you just lob the sand out in
the direction of the enemy, after all you know where he is and incoming
fire must come from that direction.

"Sandcasting
============
Ships equipped with sandcasters may launch clouds of obscuring crystals
(sand) which interfere with laser fire and small weapons such as missiles.
     Sand may be launched in the ordnance launch phase, provided that
missiles are not launched from the ship in that phase. The launch programme
must be running in the computer for the sand to be launched.
     Mark the present position of the launching ship with a blank white
counter. For as long as the ship does not change course, the counter
remains in place, indicating that a cloud of sand surrounds the ship.
     Effects: Sand hinders laser fire. Incoming laser fire is subject to a
DM of -3, outgoing laser fire is subject to a DM -1.
     Sand affects incoming missiles slightly. Missiles receive a DM of -1on
the attack table if the target is in a sand cloud.
     Dispersal: A sand cloud remains in place remains in place for as long
as the ship doesn\'t change course. It dissipates when the ship changes
course.
     A ship has a store of sand equal to its tonnage (a 100 ton ship has
100 shots of sand), which is effectively unlimited in the course of a
Mayday scenario. Sand can only protect the launching ship; it cannot
protect another ship, a missile, or a small craft."

This last sentence suggests the sand cloud is pretty close to the ship. The
next to last sentence suggests that a "shot" of sand is a canister - 100 x
50 kg canisters is 5 tons. Hope this helps...

    'body' => 'All this talk of Cylons sparked an idea for my own
Traveller campaign.  These are the designs I came
up for the best know types of leaders with w/o
Fusion+.  I\'ve been toying with the idea that
perhaps the reason they are coming is that Cleon
stole the original designs for the Fusion+ power
plants from them.

According to CSC (p 48), "Robots are never self
aware or artificially intelligent, but they can have a
depth of programming capable of thinking ahead
on multiple possibilities and the likelihood of
success in a given situation." Therefore, the
Cylons as depicted on the TV series BattleStar
Galactica actually seem to conform to the
Traveller cannon. Perhaps, this is the reason they
did so badly (relatively speaking) against the
colonial warriors (who were self aware and
capable of an occasional leap of logic).

They never exhibited any innate (internal) ability to
communicate with each other or the larger
computers on board their ships. As I recall the only
way they could communicate was via conventional
communications equipment, so there are no
internal communications links. Even the thinker
types seemed to interact with the large computers
only in their presence (face to face as it were).
There may be a religious reason for this.

If I recall correctly, the weapons they used were
also stand alone, not sub-components. I seem to
recall Colonial Warriors occasionally taking one
of their weapons from a fallen Cylon and using it
on them while running away (excuse me, I mean
"making a strategic advance to the rear").

They even became lost (with out the help of
Colonial Warriors). So, unless they had targeting
systems on-board, they didn\'t seem to have any
internal electronics (except for their "brains").
This would also be in keeping with the original
design concept of their creators (the True Cylons,
intelligent reptiles of some sort).

These designs were made using FF&S with the
exceptions of the propulsion systems (legs/hands
and arms) which are from CSC. I can\'t remember
the names used in the series. I guess someone
else will have to supply them. Unless noted
otherwise all systems are TL 12, volume is in
liters, mass is in kg and cost is in credits.

They might use some variation of a squat toilet -- I\'ve
seen depictions of these things in some Japanese manga.
Basically, it\'s a ceramic latrine, i.e., a little trench
in the ground you squat over and do your business.
The artificial version is hooked up to plumbing
that flushes it clean, same as a sit-toilet.

It wouldn\'t really be a "perch." Remember, Droyne wings are
almost vesigal. But it would be some place they could hinch
down and snooze (without going horizontal). I\'m not too clear
why warrior (and worker -- they\'re big too) perches would have
to be higher.

Okay, I\'m not too clear on the probability distribution of various
sorts of MV\'s, so I\'m taking a very flat and guesswork approach here,
and trusting that you will correct me if you think this is off-base.

MVs vary is mass from .08 - .50 Sols (this is a guess, obviously, please
correct). BrnDrvs vary in mass from .01 - .08 Sols (this is a little
firmer). So... MVs have a range of .42 Sols vs BrnDrvs which have a
range of .07 Sols.

..07/.42 = 1/6, so there are about one-sixth as many BrnDrvs as MVs.

Fair enough?

Also, do you think it is likely for Brown Dwarves to occur in pairs
(i.e. binaries) when occuring as the hub of their own "solar" system?
I take it that MVs frequently do this, so it ought to be as common
for their lesser cousins, right?

You might want to know that the Jump Drive IS fusion reactor, al bit
high-throughput fusion reactor, is being pushed *really* hard on the GURPS

This sounds like a serious question, so, I will attempt to give you a
serious answer.

All material objects have mass.  Anything that is in a gravitational well^
will also have a weight.  On earth, the mass and the weight are the same.

Let\'s say that there is a bar of platinum that has a mass of exactly 1 kg
(like the ones in the Standards and Measures Offices around the world).  If
you had a ideal scale, and you were to place that platinum bar on it, you
would find that it weighed exactly 1 kg.  If you took the same scale and bar
to the moon you would find that it only weighed about 1/6th kg.  The mass
didn\'t change, but the gravity (and therefore the mass) did.

I believe the question which started this part of the discussion, "Which one
[a pound of silver or a pound of iron] would hit the ground first?" was
intended to be rhetorical or perhaps facetious (with me at the butt of the
joke), and completely overlooked the point about the English (or Imperial)
standard vs. the metric standard.


But, back to your question.  The fact is that neither the weight, nor the
mass have much bearing on the question.  Instead, it is the density that
matters most (assuming the same relative shape of objects).  The pound of
silver weighs less than the pound of iron, but because it has a higher
density, it would hit the ground first (if you were using an ideal timer you
could tell the difference).

Density is the mass of an object divided by its volume.

The simplest way to model this is by making systems that are very fragile
only have one point of damage. Also, no one said that the "effectiveness"
scale had to be linear or the same for all systems. If you wanted to model
a bulky system that was easily knocked out, simply have the first point of
damage put it out of commision, and have all the rest be "free hits."

If you wanted to keep things even more simple than has thus far been
suggested, you could assign systems a set number of "hits," and just make
them fail when destroyed.

of reference.  There\'s also another Happy Fun Ball design, as some might

But no Jet Bong!  I swear!  That would encourage drug abuse among the
youthful converts to T4/MMT!

Vaguely in the works: a short essay on why the Sayat have the draft but no
Starship Troopers (per se), and a sketch of their language\'s inflectional
morphology.

The only remaining question about this sequence comes from Thanasis Kinias. 
He feels that DV should be divided by 0.7, increasing it by 43%, to take
into account the changes in armor values between FFS1 and FFS2.  I\'m not
sure if this is right, and haven\'t heard either way from Dave or Guy.

1. Exactly how is the PAW Damage Modifier applied?  

It\'s not used in the design sequence, just calculated and said to affect DV
in later calculations. I\'d think DV should really be calculated as:

  DV = DM * 5 * (Intensity)^.5

....but the book never actually says.

2.  On page 13 under Standard, the maximum length of a weapon is limited to
25% of the shortest dimension of the ship\'s hull. This applies to Fixed
Mount weapons and does *not* apply to spinal or parallel weapons...I don\'t
think? It certainly *could* apply to a fixed laser or PAW on a small ship,
and *really* limit it\'s length. 

I don\'t think it applies to turret and/or bay weapons either, right?  

IAC, the maximum weapon diameter isn\'t addressed anywhere.  Even with
spinals the width of the accelerator tube shouldn\'t be more than x% of the
hull\'s smallest dimension.  What should x be?  What do you think..50%, 60%,
75% of the hull\'s smallest dimension?

that perhaps the massive "giant" Jovian like planets are really stars that

in binary systems, then it is possible it could have been a trinary star

	The weapon was not concealed, it was worn open. It was a cermoninal
	weapon used - a Tl:7 Magnum revolver. Think about the picture of
	the Sha of Perisa who allways had a scimitar, even when he meet
	with other politicans, its a question of protocol not of security.

	This is of course posible - like Herrhausen who was an CIA inside job.

	But intelligence agencies prefer to leave some letter from a terrorist
	group to point in the wrong direction. Perhaps it was an IRIS inside
	job, failed the goal that both Dulinor and the complete Emperial
	household had to die, to bring Magaret on the Iridum Throne. She
	was allways the "good guy" in MT. This should make us suspicious.

The UK printing didn\'t have counters. However CE have the counters and the
(corrected) ship forms as PDFs on their website, an admirable approach to
errata - something IG could do with looking at.

I was impressed with it, the combat rules have been separated out, along
with the sheets and I hope to play it RSN..

Something that I wholeheartedly agree with. Although if I play TBP I\'ll be
using T4 or T4.1 as the rules.

I kinda got he impression that they look like the Pierson\'s Puppeteers
(created by Larry Niven).  As for poses, go to any barnyard and look at the
cows for inspirations.  :-)  Those would be the city K\'ree.  For your more
independant/rural types, a good source would be wild ruminants like the
bison (America buffalo, if there are any still wild).

Sorry but the info that I have is a bit different:

The Star Trek Pilot ("The Cage") cost $630,000
(source "The Star Trek Compendium")
or $686,000 (source "Star Trek Movie Memories").

The Dr Who Pilot cost £2,143(episode 1); £4,307; £2,181 and £2,316.
Plus £4,328 for the Tardis interior sets.
(Source "The Handbook - The First Doctor")

Indeed I seem to recall calculating that, allowing for exchange rates,
the first three years of Dr Who (126 episodes) cost less than the
Star Trek pilot.

I also recall reading somewhere that the per episode cost of Battlestar
Galatica was >$1million due to the cost of the effects.

The only remaining question about this sequence comes from Thanasis Kinias. 
He feels that DV should be divided by 0.7, increasing it by 43%, to take
into account the changes in armor values between FFS1 and FFS2.  I\'m not
sure if this is right, and haven\'t heard either way from Dave or Guy.

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  What follows are the formulas that I have dug out of old magazines, old
astronomy magazines, old game book resourses, or from the Self teaching
Astronomy book I bought about a year ago <grin>.
  A few people have helped me to understand things (or so I hope I
understand!), and any errors I have made, is my fault.  Also, if anyone
sees a glaring major mistake, feel free to correct me, but if you do,
stand ready to point out the reference that will permit me to check this
up <chuckle>.

Luminosity of star = (100^.2)^(4.85-absolute magnitude of star)

The original equation I was using for mass of star was take from a book
explaining that luminosity is equal to approximately (note the word
approximately <frown>) mass^3.5.  I reworked it from the point of view
that mass now equals:

Star\'s mass = star\'s luminosity^(1/3.5)

  However, recently, I came across a new set of formulas that state
Luminosity of star/luminosity of SOL = (mass of star/mass of SOL)^N where
N is equal to 

1.75*(Mass of star/mass of Sol)-.1)+3.325

  if the ratio of mass of star/mass of Sol is less than 1, otherwise, N is
equal to:

..5(2-Mass of sun/mass of SOL) + 4.4

  if the ratio of mass was greater than 1.  To use this formula, one would
have to set up a decision making routine in a program to ascertain by
"Brute" force computing, what the value for mass was.  As it turns out, if
the luminosity is greater than 1, you use the second equation, if the
luminosity is less than one, it turns out you use the first equation.
Probably, the easiest way to do this, would be to use a "do until
calculated luminosity is greater than target luminosity" in increments of
..0001 masses or so.  Eventually, the Loop will create a luminosity that is
greater than the one you are searching for, and then all you have to do is
subtract one "increment" from the final answer that dumped you out of the
loop.

Radii of stars is calculated from luminosity.  It\'s formula is:

Radius of star/radius of Sol = (Luminosity star/luminosity of Sol)^.5
times Temperature of Sol/Temp of star)^2

  This ended up being used in my program as:

Setellar raddii =  lum^.5 * (5800/stellar_temp)^2

  5800 is the temperature of Earth\'s sun.  The stellar Temperature can be
calculated by interpolation of the ranges of temperatures for different
Spectral types.  What follows are the upper Temperature limits for each
spectral type.  These temperatures are the same for each spectral type
regardless of what class the star is (ie if it is a dwarf G2 star, it will
have the same surface temperature as a Super Giant G2 star).

O = 40,000
B = 28,000
A = 10,000
F =  7,500
G =  6,000
K =  5,000
M =  3,500

  From I have been able to find, it would appear that the lowest
temperature a star can exist (surface temperature that is) at 3,000
degrees Kelvin.  Rather than write out the method for interpolation of
stellar temperatures, I will show you the "structure" for my program that
I used, and give an example of how it is done (whew!).

Let O_differential = (-40000 + 28000)/10
let B_differential = (-28000 + 10000)/10
let A_differential = (-10000 +  7500)/10
let F_differential = (- 7500 +  6000)/10
let G_differential = (- 6000 +  5000)/10
let K_differential = (- 5000 +  3500)/10
let M_differential = (- 3500 +  3000)/10

 Multiply the "decimal" portion of the star spectral class by the
differential that matches it\'s letter portion of the spectral lable.  Then
add this value to the "upper limit" of that class\'s temperature.

Thus, a G2 star, would have a differential of -100.  -100 x 2 = -200.
Additing this to the upper limit of 6000 degrees Kelvin for a G0 class, we
find that stellar temperature is 6000 + (-200) or 5800 degrees Kelvin,
which matches what Earth\'s expected surface temperature is.  A F4 star
then, would be -150 x 4, or -600.  Adding this to the top temperature for
an F class star, and we get 7500-600= 6900 degrees Kelvin.

  According to Terry Kepner\'s book PROXIMITY ZERO second edition, the
mass of the sun is equal to approximately 1.989 x 10^30 kilograms.
Unfortunately, I failed to bring my old Physics book that lists the radius
of the Sun in Kilometers (ack!).  Terry Kepner also uses the inner and out
limits of habitation equal to .75 AU * Luminosity for the inner, and 1.4
AU * luminosity for the outer limits of life sustaining habitation.  I
have come across references that state the inner and outer limits are
actually closer to .93 and 1.04!  However, it would seem that most prefer
to use the somewhat wider zone of habitability <grin>.

  Also available in Terry Kepner\'s book, is the theory that Binary stars
can have stable orbits up to 1/5th the separation in AU\'s.  Thus, if the
separation of two stars is listed as being 80 AU\'s, the stable orbits
would go out to 16 AU\'s.  Bear in mind, that if you have two stars with
eccentricities that bring the stars as close as 16 AU\'s but as far as 64
AU\'s would have an average separation of only 40 AU\'s.  Therefore,
calculate the max distance for stable orbits from the "closest" approach
of the stars.
  For the record, Terry\'s book has quite a few Near Earth stars already
listed.  He indicates their special features, and their likelyhood for
having planets and such.  He lists lifezones, Luminosity, and Stellar
Masses of each star.  For the price of approximately $20 (if I recall
correctly), it is well worth picking up.  You can find his website
location by  either looking it up at

http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html

  or by using a net search for Terry Kepner or PROXIMITY ZERO.

Let\'s see, one last formula that I have, is how to calculate the absolute
magnitude given the apparent magnitude and the distance to the star.  This
is done by:

Absolute Magnitude = Apparent Magnitude + 5*log(distance)


  Hope this helps people with their quests for creating a program for
randomly generating stars.

   Not at all.  It was indeed expanded upon by AM6.  Naturally enough my
books are in Lexington as I type this (I\'m in Dayton at the moment about
2 hours away), but I\'m sure someone can quote you chapter and verse if I
don\'t get to it first.

   The important thing to remember is that the results of the American
expedition were kept secret for a time, and whether is was done out of
concern for the reaction of the population or whether it was done
because of some larger conspiracy is left up to the interpretation of
the referee.

	First of all, I\'m german and germany is using metrics for a long
	time. I have\'nt learned other scales in school. But there are
	occasions where other scales are more usefull.

	If I\'m designing something for print, I\'m thinking in points and
	inches, and not in centimeter. Somebody who tries desk top publishing
	and scales in meteric deserves shooting imho.

	In other occasions imperial scales are anachronism. E.g I have a

	50mph (even if german does\'nt have a speed limit ;-) and I\'m now
	used to think in miles when planing longer journeys.

	But unlike seamiles, land miles does\'nt make any sense, its

	convert knots in seamiles, and seamiles in degrees than with
	using metrics. The first one is possible in brain, while the

   Where or not an object "ignites" is entirely dependent upon whether
or not there is sufficent mass present.  Imagine if you will if Jupiter
had mass subtracted from it.  Take enough of its core or other elements
away and eventually Jupiter loses its ability to retain a large quantity
of hydrogen in its atmosphere as it does know.  Take enough away, and it
would lose size rather dramatically and eventually become more like the
terrestial planets (Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury, etc.) in our system. 
Conversely if we add mass to Jupiter, it will become a brown dwarf.  Add
more and more until it goes past the 80 Juipter-mass point, and
eventually a sustained fusion reaction will happen--it is not a question
of "if the circumstances are right" it *will* happen.

There is no reason other than to add color to the adventure.  I\'m working on
the assumption that the wings actually do work, I don\'t remember seeing
anything about them being useless in either Library Data: A-N or the
MegaTraveller Library book.  In fact, the picture in the A-N book showed a
Droyne with pretty large wings.

The warriors would be higher off the ground because I\'m the GM, and its just
the way of things.  I wasn\'t analyzing it when I did it, I just wanted the PCs
to be confused by what these things were (although, if I really wanted to
handwave, I could probably make up a half decent reason).  All of the doorways
were circular, but, again, no real reason, just liked it that way (actually, I
had just seen Full Metal Jacket again, and at the end the main character is
hunting a sniper in this burned out building, and all of the doorways were
circular and I thought it looked pretty neat).

That would be just as well I guess.  I didn\'t think about it too long.  Just
did it and moved on.  I now like the idea of the teleporting/disintegrating
floor thingie that others have pointed out.  Could combine the two.

  About the time MegaTraveller came out a loose organization of Traveller
fans formed to flesh out the details of the battlegrounds of the
Rebellion (ie. the entire Imperium). The sector files generated during
the development of the Classic Traveller book "Atlas of the Imperium"
were the basis for the early work. Most of the systems in the Third
Imperium\'s borders were eventually named, along with the subsectors.
By the time I found out about this group, the "History of the Imperium
Working Group" ("HIWG"), it had grown to nearly 200 past and present
members. Several subgroups had formed to develop extra-Imperial space,
starting from scratch or fragments in print. A good chunk of rimward
Vargr space was done, as was a fair bit of Aslan space.
 Several people were (and may still be) doing the details of Zhodani
space (my own area of interest). I know that Zhdant, Tienspevnekr, and
Yiklerzdanzh are all done to the basic sector listing or beyond (well
beyond in the case of Yiklerzdanzh), as is the upper half of Afachtiabr.
Chunks of Ziafrplians exist in some detail, though I don\'t think the
sector listing is completely named as yet. I recall someone was working
on Tsadra and Tsadra Davr, but I don\'t have any details.
 Iakr was set aside as a Referee\'s Reserve by GDW, so there will be
nothing (else) official done there if IG holds to the Reserve. I may
post MY version of Iakr at some point...

  HIWG continues to operate as a writer\'s club for Traveller, though
my own involvement is rather limited these days. A bad case of the real
world...
  I don\'t know if all of the work is collected in one coherent set
on the net. The upper half of Afachtiabr (aka Far Frontiers) was
published in Traveller Chronicle two-three years ago, and one subsector
of Ziafrplians appeared in HIWGs internal newsletter. I don\'t believe
anything else from Zhodani space has appeared in widespread print...

   True, but I was being relatively generous, allowing for the
possibility of storage lockers under the beds, etc.  Also, we\'re talking
bunks in a space ship not a wet navy ship, and I\'m pretty sure they are
significantly differnet.

Well, you could just treat it as water. So, 1 litre of wine weights 1 kilogram. Throw in a bit more for the bottle/bag/container,
though.

  I agree on all points except the last - cash out and go for something
relatively safe - smuggling, fraud, backing up without broadcasting the
correct rumbling/beeping soundtrack, etc.

  Skimming is only cheaper if there are no finance payments to be made,
and if the financial opportunity cost is fairly low; i.e., no extra cargo
runs per quarter with the time required for the side-trip.

  2300 AD died with GDW. One would best describe it as "in hiatus";
Tantalus has possession of the copyright but so far as expressed no desire
to do anything with it. Their still is a HUGE following on the net for
this most excellent game, however - look on my homepage for some pointers
to some sites (I\'ll soon be upgrading the list to be more current)

  Ahh, to have a few million bucks to play with... ;)

  I haven\'t tried to convert the Kafers to TNE (or any other Traveller
product) mainly b/c I\'m more interested in 2300 right now.

Worse. The torpedo in question usually didn\'t detonate when it hit straight
on, but would often work when it struck a glancing blow. This meant that the
least skilled skippers who managed by stubborn persistance or dumb luck to
graze a target would often be rewarded by a sinking, whereas the skilled
skippers who managed to maneuver in close and achieve good, square hits
failed. This meant that the less competent sub commanders began getting a
greater chance at promotions and their pick of the newer boats. Furthermore,
the problems with the torpedo were detected fairly early in the war, but it
was not replaced for a distressingly long time.

Ya can\'t make up stuff this strange. 

If I had written a novel about a fictional war, and tried to make stuff like
this up, or if I had put something equivalent to this into Traveller, it would
have been driven from this list by hoots and catcalls...

Someone noted a comment in Babylon 5 about the traditional Membari gesture of

gesture to open trade negotiations: riding towards the village at full gallop,

   An extrapolation on my part.  Not to quibble, but wouldn\'t that
depend upon whether the object in question was closer in size to a red
dwarf than a gas giant?  I could easily see a scenario where a gas giant
drew in enough mass to cross the line and become a brown dwarf.

   I wonder why.  :-)

   I was just paraphrasing the article.

   The text I\'ve read on the subject (not related to the article on the
Pleiades brown dwarfs, which may be the problem) indicated that the
brown dwarfs being studied were companions to stars, not out by
themselves.  If you say so, then it must be the case.

It\'s more a matter of congnition. People think in the units they are brought
up with, which is why people brought up with Imperial units find themselves
picturing things in Imperial units; it\'s how their brain works.

However for Traveller, I think that metrics has to be the way to go. Canon
dictates it. The RoM grows out of the UN and the various national governments.
And as far as I\'m aware the UN and all the worlds major governments use
metrics (even the US govt uses metrics, its only the general population which
sticks with Imperial units :*>).

RE:  Astropolitical Influences of the Number 4


I am delighted to learn that you, too, have noted the interesting situation
that every integer is the sum of no more than four squares.  So far as we
have been able to determine, this was first conclusively proven by the
Solomani comrade Lagrange.  Interesting, yes?  The very same person who
discovered the stable orbital points so useful in building large space
habitats and other facilities.  Clearly this is not a coincidence.  You
will note that she made the former proof in the Solomani year 1770, and
that the standard Imperial astrography is constructed so as to contain a
coordinate marked 1770 in each sector.  We suggest an immediate armed
reconnaissance of all such locations.

(I\'m sure you will agree that Solomani-derived cartography exhibits many
interesting encodings of 4 -- the subsector grid within a sector (4x4 or
4^2 ?), for example -- all of which demand serious analysis.)

The signficance of only one in six of all numbers actually _requiring_ four
squares is unclear to us.  Clearly, 4^n(8m+7) is worthy of further study
and interpretation vis-a-vis the secret patterning of space settlement.

Furthermore, you will note that the probable solution to the "map coloring
problem" (as described by Solomani mathematicians) is four.  To us this
suggests (if proven) that the secular profusion of geopolitical units on
the interstellar map are reducible to four unique and perfectly
noncontiguous power blocs.  Our colleagues [CLASSIFIED], as you might well
imagine.

I must note that your faith (as I am able to understand it at this time)
may neglect to fully account for the ontonumeric properties of _one_.
Consider, for example, the children\'s game (among us in the Concourse --
your people, too?) of taking any number, forming a new number from the sum
of the squares of its digits, and iterating.  As you know, the sequence
always either lands at 1, or settles into the loop based on 4 (4, 16, 37,
89, 145, 42, 20, 4...).  That is why we in the Concouse [CLASSIFIED] or
until such a time.

Furthermore, as Brocard, another late Solomani comrade, pointed out, n!+1
is a square when n=4 -- that is, 4!+1=5.  Five, yes?  [CLASSIFIED] Guaran
[CLASSIFIED].  Think about it!

Your gift of sulfuric acid bath salts were most appreciated by myself and
other Slimy members of the embassy (though our Sayat comrades did rather
object to its unusually pungent bouquet!), and I hope you will all enjoy
the copper oxide breakfast-cereal flakes which I have taken the liberty of
enclosing.

That covers my concerns quite admirably.  Us gearheads don\'t mind a little
extra paperwork for the added realism it brings to a game.  We don\'t need a
description cards when we can have an actual detail sheet covering the
actual state of repair using statistics like you have described.

misfortune to own. Starships is superb compared to it and generally has
better deckplans (I mean SSDS ain\'t bad!). Bear in mind that this is
written having read the first part in detail and skimmed the other two (as
I haven\'t the stomach for reading them in depth).

The Annililik Run, by James M Ward.

Hereafter I\'ll call it AR for short.

AR Pros:
- ----
1) One of the best Foss covers to date (Very attractive and almost
Travelleresque).

2) Nice art by Steve Bryant inside.

3) layout isn\'t bad at all.

AR Cons.
- ----
1) The scenario does not meet the blurb on the back. Cpt Tanner is not the
owner of the Annililik, rather he owns the Phoenix in the first scenario.

2) The three parts are only vaguely linked by the fact that they allegedly
occur on the route from Core to Vland. Why allegedly? There are *no*
starmaps and not even a reference to First Survey (flawed though it is).

3) In what appears to be an attempt at simplifying the writing, most
locations in the first part of the scenario are asteroids. These have lousy
deckplans/layouts, and in most cases are unbelievable.

4) The Phoenix is not detailed, and is probably totally uneconomic (5000
dt, J0, M4, 500dt cargo and running on incidental contraband).

5) the J0 must be a typo else it coudn\'t enter all the different systems
described, could it?

6) A total lack of understanding of the Traveller ethos, background, or
rules - examples include references to the "Vland Territories", loads of
>TL12 (TL15!) artifacts in the cargo IN MILIEU 0, loads of almost AI
robots, Marines commonly refered to as \'Space Marines\', no references to
the Sylean Federation, an ex-Vilani Military officer called \'Blackjack
Tanner\', robots programmed by Tanner who has no computer or robotics skill,
main npcs, magic neutron grenades, magic plasma devices, the magic
gravitron spike, assorted non-canon TL11 aliens and ships...

7) A scenario written to randomly kill characters - the final attack on the
ship should butcher the players if played by T4 rules.

8) Little bits of egotism by the author (may characters/npcs are named with
variations on his name).

9) Lack of understanding of FFS2/QSDS etc. (Eg magic laser weapons that can
obtain double the power from a laser pack).

10) three different scenarios with three different ships with no reason for
the players to run through these.

In short this is an AD&D scenario written for Traveller that is totally
insensitive to the published background. Before, we\'ve seen IG ignore the
previously published background and rules. Here we see them ignore the T4
rules and supplements they have published. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - its
glossy finish means that it can\'t even serve as a mouse mat like Starships.

A final note - the credits read \'Based on an Original Concept by BITS/CORE
(Andy Lilly, Jo Grant and David Burden)\'. Somehow I think that the
\'Original Concept\' here has less to do with the published scenario than
Starship Troopers had to do with Heinlein\'s book. I guess that the CORE
concept writers wouldn\'t mind their name being taken off this unmitigated
rubbish.

the nth time after seeing the movie and having it perk my interest again.
So, what does this have to do with Traveller, you ask? Well the novel is a
very rich source for information on the long distance control of an
interstellar empire without FTL commo, if you read between the lines, and it
has made me think about the fall of the 2nd Empire.

There was a short lived thread on the list a while back about the break
apart of the ROM and I would like to see it restarted. Basically, as i
remeber it, it discussed the rules of succession in the ROM and how the
Emperors councillors may have broken up into warring factions over the
succession. How CANON is this idea? Relating some of this to the Dune story
line, what does the list think the chances were that some of the Great
Houses (to use the Dune term) went "renegade" during the struggles for
power? Tearing off into the unknown with their technology and retainers to
set up Pocket Empires in non-Imperial Space. Would you expect these PE\'s to
retain and even improve on the 2I base tehlevel? If they did miss the Long
Night, about what tech level would they be expected to be at by M:0? Where
is the most likely place for these PE\'s to be found?

What information is out there about the ROM? I have none of the MetaTrav
books, how much and what books contain, information partaining to the fall
of the ROM? Is there anyone else out there working in this millieu?

Thanks for listeming

basically the first 3 LBBs, the half adventure Shadows and another small

Maybe the population simply did not breed rapidly enough to replace
itself and the population decreased naturally without any disasters at
all.

Suppose that each woman on Khula in Milieu 0 had an average of 1.7
children.  Assuming that emigration and immigration balanced and that
the number of clone births & birth by men is insignificant each
generation on Khula will be 85% of the size of the previos generation. 
If Khula averaged 3 generations per century then the population of Khula
would drop 62% in only 200 years and by over 91% in only 500 years.  In
1100 years its population would drop 99.5%+, if its Milieu 0 population
was 90 billion its Milieu 1100 population would then be about 400
million (population 8).  Obviously these figures are slightly simplified
since many people from previous generations will still be alive in
Milieu 1100 and the Milieu 0 population was (presumably) not all of
child bearing age (whatever that is by TL 12).

These fertility rates are fairly consistant with those seen right now in
native born populations in some northern european countries so this is
by no means an implausible scenario.  This rate of population loss could
also be mandated by the government, similar to China one child policy,
please note that it is Governmnet A & Law Level A in Milieu 0.  It is
not too implausible to relate the change to balkanization as being
related to the population loss - as the population grew less dense it
became less easy and less necessary to maintain a world government.  A
cynic could even make a story out of this, for instance:

Khula\'s governmnet in Milieu 0 adopted a one child per woman rule for
its subjects of SOC 2-9 while limiting its SOC 10-12 subjects to 2
children.  This would give an average female fertility rate of 1.17
children.  This policy continued for 200 years during which time the
population dropped from 90 billion to about 3 billion.  The governmnet
was then overthrown (for reasons that may, or may not, have been
related).  The rebels decided that world governmnet was two dangerous
and set up nation states.  With the removal of the 1 child per woman
policy fertility rates climbed back to replacement levels, but no
higher, and Khula\'s population has remained roughly stable for the past
900 years. 

If each woman on Khula had an average of 1.2 children each generation
would be only 60% as big as the previous generation.  Khula\'s population
would then drop 95%+ in only 200 years.  In 1100 years (33 generations)
the population would drop 99.999995%+, if its Milieu 0 population was 90
billion its Milieu 1100 population would then be about 4,300 people
(population 5).

As populations grow richer and more technically advanced they tend to
have fewer children.  There is _NO_ reason to presume that this trend
will not continue.  In addition to this general explanation there are
any number of planet specific reasons why the population might tend to
decrease.  For example Khula has a tainted atmosphere.  It is quite
possible that the nature of this taint has a subtle negative effect on
the human reproductive system (male, female, or both).

It could well be the same reason, negative population growth.

I should note that "canonically" in Traveller populations are assumed to
grow.  TNE explains how to convert from the immediate post Virus
pouplation to the Milieu 1200 population by deciding on the population
growth rate of the planet.  Just because the post Final War population
tended to grow does not mean that earlier populations did so.  Nor are
individual Refs bound by this policy if they disagree.

to read ... I think hardly anyone missed me.

As far as I got I\'ll say that I await GURPS: Traveller.
I do not know much of GURPS, I by now only read one supplement.
But what I\'ve seen of this system seems very interesting to me. I do not
think of adapting the rules to my campaign yet, but perhaps will use them
in a new one - especially if there are some GURPS experienced players.

Now what makes me think a lot is the idea of an alternate timeline
starting at 1116. This is not because I don\'t like it, as I do like it -
In fact I am planning to make my campaign into a search of one of
grandfathers unknown artifacts - a time machine. That\'s why the module I
bought was GURPS: Time Travel ... (for those who think this will be to
powerful - it isn\'t, as it\'s not moveable and travel is only possible
within the existance time of this thing with a ship not more than 100 tons
- - hey, that\'s my part of the universe!.)

Now see what comes to my mind: If my players find out how to use that
thing, and want to make it, they have the possibility to travel into two
different futures - one with and one without the imperium. Or they could
be the ones to travel back in time from the assassination of Strephon and
alter history!

I wonder if anyone would publish the adventures in my mind - they now get
very complex. Pray my group won\'t kill me for them!

AFAIK, there was a canon trade good called "highleaf", perhaps this is a
kind of this locoweed ... as it was restricted to non-Imperial trade, I
wonder what impact it had on humans ... or horses, as the K\'kree resemble
more of them than cows. I wonder if catnip is the same what in Germany is
called Baldrian ...

Now let\'s think about the diverse human drinks with their substances:

Coffee - coffeine
Tea    - teine
Cacao  - theobromine
Chocl. - theophylline

As these are quite similar substances, what would do tea to an
Vargr/Aslan/K\'kree?
Does anybody know more (mildly) intoxicating substances?
Enter the chemistry of Traveller ...

Er ... how do I say it polite? I think, of the three German readers of
this Mailing list, we do understand the English postings quite well.
I am sorry, I do NOT quite understand the German postings without the
English ones, as they seem to be translated word by word, which is the
completely wrong.
So better stop it, these belong to the "funny once" category.

But I would like to give you some hints how to enhance your german as I am
fluent in this language since nearly the 26 years I\'m on this earth.

I wish you many efforts in learning new languages, but - later.

As Craig said, starships probably *aren\'t* built at Tauri Down Port; the
local technology isn\'t up to it.  But, if you\'ve looked at the economics
of the route for THUDDD-8, a class A starport has serious benefits for a
world even if it doesn\'t build any ships there.

First off, class-A ports have Broker-4 offices which give a big boost to
speculative trade.  Always, always use the best broker you can buy.  The
share they get may be 20% of selling price, but on average you\'ll get an
increase of 50% in selling price by using them.

Better starport facilities also benefit a trader when buying trade goods.
All other things being equal, goods from a world with a class-A port will
cost kCr 2 less per ton than they would from an identical world that has
a class-C starport.

This encourages trade traffic.  You can buy lower and sell higher at a
world with a good port than anywhere else.  Having a good starport isn\'t
everything, though.  A tech level much lower than neighbor worlds and a
lack of trade classifications in demand can still make exporting too
unprofitable.

The next target for class-A starport construction should be one of the
high-tech powerhouses like Vland or Khula.  They can certainly afford
the expenditure, would reap serious benefits, and a site that actually
could build modern ships in the area would be nice.

I\'ve never thought about it before, but you\'re right. The issue should have
been addressed. I don\'t think the IISS guards could necessarily have saved
Iphegenia -- it dosen\'t take long to fire three shots -- but Dulinor could
not have felt at all confident of surviving unless the IISS guards had
somehow been dealt with. (Come to think about it, wouldn\'t there be a
risk of other High Nobles (with ceremonial guns) being present?

There I disagree. There was no coincidence involved. Read the two stories
again. Dulinor had arranged for the two princes to be assasinated
simultaneously (Dulinor must have used up several lifetimes of luck in
setting up such a complicated operations without someone letting the
cat out of the bag). The assasination was bungled but gave Lucan the
opportunity to kill Varian.

Sigh. Gas Giants are big. The odds that a merchant will chose just that
part of the Gas Giant close enough to where you are lurking is... not
good. Furthermore, Gas Giant refuelling takes time and is seldomly
economical (I say seldomly to avoid setting off a new debate on this
line; personally I think the word should be \'almost never\', but others
think differently). 

>Moons (depends on how small and close).

If you \'lurk\' where you can see a merchant coming, the merchant can see
you. And why should any merchant fly close to a moon? Space is big and
moons are small. There\'s plenty of room to avoid them. Besides, how did
you get to the moon in the first place? You arrived at the planetary
jump limit and moved there under power. A single SDB will give the
authorities an excellent to track you all the way. A couple will make
it impossible for you to avoid detection.

I don\'t think so. I think that each turn needs to be viewed as a seperate

Fair enough - the number is poorly enough known that you can pretty much
make it up.

BTW, in astronomy, the plural of "Dwarf" is "Dwarfs."

I think it\'s likely, but it\'s debatable - depends on how binary stars form
(which we don\'t know.)

It\'s a good question, and not a quibble. The question is - how does one
define the difference between a brown dwarf and a gas giant? There\'s no
consensus on a magic mass number to arbitrarily use to define the 
difference, so the main choices are (a) define based on formation mechanism
(brown dwarfs form like stars, gas giants form like planets); (b) define
based on "significant" deuterium-burning early in their life; or (c)
pretend there\'s no meaningful distinction. It\'s worth some argument.

To have succession wars, you need to have at least stabalised on
a succession. I hadn\'t thought there were actually emporers in
the Rule of Man.
  I think a better model for the Rule of Man is the Alexandrian Empire.
There he tore into a vast, old, creaking empire (The Persian Empire,
which was actually larger than the Roman Empire ever got) and
took it over. There was really no way he could rule it even if he hadn\'t
died. It all, more or less, fell apart afterward with little enclaves
who remembered (anyone see/read The Man Who Would be King?).

I think this was a continuous process throughout Imperial History. I\'m
in the middle of creating sector files for all those periferial sectors that
there are just dot-plots for. Man, there are little "Pocket Empires" all
over the bloody place. Even in 1100. I think they are there in all ages,
wherever the edge is.

Not a chance. It is going to be difficult enough for them to be self
sufficient, let alone prevent backsliding.

>If they did miss the Long Night,

You could say that a Pocket Empire is continually in the dark of a
Long Night. The definition of the Long Night was the cessation
of anything more than very local trade. A Pocket Empire is
always in this state.

>Where is the most likely place for these PE\'s to be found?

On the edge of _any_ milieu.

Speculations on Vargr based on the reactions of dogs have some value, but I
point out (yet again) that Aslan and K\'kree are no more closely related to
cats and horses (respectively) than they are to eggplants. Both have different
biochemistries than Terran animals, and will probably react differently to
tea, coffee, etc. 

They will probably _have_ intoxicants, but they will probably not be effected
in the same way by catnip/locoweed/tea/.coffee/buttermilk/tofu as humans.

Yep.  We were playing with this one over on the TravLang list... well, we
were abusing it, technically.  Well, I was, anyway.

Try doing English -> Portuguese -> French -> English of some of the

As a matter of fact... I might have.

Early Sunday morning, a mathematician at the Sayat embassy send a brief
note to the Darmine Theological University regarding numerological evidence
of Solomani astrographic conspiracies.

Probably not.  The German "Baldrian" translates to the English "Valerian."
Valerian is a medicinal preparation made from the roots of one of a group of
medicial plants known as valerians, the best known of which is Heliotrope.

Good point Loren.  Coming from such different genetic backgrounds, it is
quite possible that the above mentioned stimulants and depressants would
either be deadly poisons or of no effect at all.  However, if they have a
nervous system at all simular to the Terran variety, they (the plants) might
affect them just as they do us and other Terrans.

     Valerian is a plant, not exactly a preparation, and its powdered root 
     is the leading over the counter tranquilizer sold in Europe.  Valerian 
     officinalis, officially.  I suppose its just splitting hairs.....
     
     I often drink an infusion of the root (tea) and it works very well 
     (Laid Back, as SnoopDD would say).

     Valerian is a plant, not exactly a preparation, and its powdered root

Probably not.  The German "Baldrian" translates to the English "Valerian." 
Valerian is a medicinal preparation made from the roots of one of a group of 
medicial plants known as valerians, the best known of which is Heliotrope.

Good point Loren.  Coming from such different genetic backgrounds, it is 
quite possible that the above mentioned stimulants and depressants would 
either be deadly poisons or of no effect at all.  However, if they have a 
nervous system at all simular to the Terran variety, they (the plants) might 
affect them just as they do us and other Terrans.

It occurs to me that Dulinor must have had inside help, at a fairly
high level, to pull off what he did.

What if that help was Lucan?  Dulinor could have contacted him,
explained that the Imperium needed a New, Better, Younger government,
and convinced Lucan to help him.  He would have explained to Lucan
that once the others were out of the way, it would be clear for Lucan
to take the throne.

Of course, Dulinor is planning to double-cross Lucan and seize the
throne for himself (and if Lucan didn\'t realize this, then he wasn\'t
too bright -- but we have a fair amount of evidence that Lucan wasn\'t
exactly all there upstairs, especially when it came to long-term
political forethought).  So Lucan is monitoring things, realizes
in the middle of affairs that Dulinor is trying to take the throne himself, andtakes
advantage of the opportunity to eliminate his
older brother...

Valerian (shrub), common name for a family of plants of the teasel order,
and especially for any of various perennial shrubs or herbs of the
representative genus, native to mainly cool, northern temperate regions.

Valerians vary in height from 0.6 to 1.5 m (2 to 5 ft) and have thick,
acrid-smelling roots and either simple or lobed leaves. The small pink or
white flowers grow in dense clusters and are often highly fragrant. The
common valerian, or garden heliotrope, native to Europe and northern Asia,
is cultivated as an ornamental; its roots are the source of a sedative drug.
It is unrelated to true heliotropes.

Scientific classification: Valerians make up the family Valerianaceae. The
representative genus is Valeriana. The common valerian, or garden
heliotrope, is classified as Valeriana officinalis.

Folks,
	Several people have suggested I owe Mr. Flores a public apology,
and I agree. My response to his "FCC Modem Tax" warning failed
miserably in its attempt to be a gentle jab, and came across
instead as a public attack and an attempt to humiliate him.

Mr. Flores,
	I apologize for the tone of my response to your email. My
sarcasm, in an attempt to stop the hoax dead in its tracks, went
way over the line, and was uncalled for. I should have simply
pointed out that the information was a hoax, and left it at that.

I\'m not so sure it IS a hoax, anymore.  Mercury News service just ran a
story on it today, claiming the same things Mr. Flores said.  When I
first read his message, I promptly emailed the FCC and got this response
:

> This is an automated response to the message you sent to isp@fcc.gov.  We established this mailbox
> for informal comments about usage of the public switched telephone network by Internet access and
> information service providers for a proceeding on this matter in 1997.

> is out of date.  The FCC decided in May 1997 NOT to allow imposition of interstate access charges
> on Internet service providers. There is no comment period currently open in this proceeding.

After receiving this response, I too laughed his message off as
mistaken.  Then I read in today\'s Mercury Silicon Valley News that such
IS the case.  Now I am wondering who is right and who is wrong?

I emailed Patricia Sullivan at Mercury News to ask what was going on,
and where they got their information.
If indeed the FCC is trying to shove everyone off the internet and make
it an exclusive playground for the rich, I\'m all for tearing it down. 
If freedom of speech (including the Internet) isn\'t for everyone, then
it means nothing and is a sad harebringer of things to come in our
stagnant society.  I fully intend to fight this
if true.  No one is taking MY freedom or putting a high price on it. 
Far as I am concerned the FCC is asking for trouble and I\'ll be happy to
give them some.

Who else feels this way?

You wouldn\'t have to know the exact identity.  I\'d expect the Emperor and
Empress to be dead before anyone else reacts and possibly his third shot (at
Iphegenia, but intercepted by the good ol ambassador) too.  The fourth
requires some explaining to me... i don\'t know, maybe someone froze.  I can
see a good npc as a remnant in my campaign.  Might be completely looney at his
failure.  Maybe he\'s like Clint Eastwoods character in In the Line of Fire.
He started for her, is knocked out of the way by the Ambassador enroute to his
destiny and then the Illelish Guard are picking off everyone on the Dias
except Dulinor and the heirs (HE has to be the one to kill THEM) the whole
time.

This was discussed in passing in the Rebellion Sourcebook (as u\'re no doubt
aware).  Of course, the Imperium may well have collapsed anyways.  Just
replace Lucan and his insanity with Iphegenia at first and then the real
Strephon comes back and she welcomes him.  Margaret... who knows.  Her real
character has been revealed already on this list but she may well have stayed
in line.  Brzk?  Probably stays in line too.  Iphegenia and/or Strephon
wouldn\'t shortsightedly strip the frontiers bare of their fleets.  This would
leave far less to take on Dulinor, giving him time to acquire some legitimacy.
Maybe he makes a truce w/ the Solomani.  Craig gets split up between Illelish
and the Solomani or maybe he survives in a small enclave or escapes to reclaim
his territory later. Domain of Sol ceases to exist. (whatever happened to
Adair anyways?)  Deneb may not be cut off. 
     The Imperium is now facing 2 opponets (Illelish and the Solomani).  Who
knows about tensions w/ the K\'kree.  The Zhodani might not like an Imperium
beating the war drums.  Maybe they invade too. If not, it\'ll probably take a
few years to eventually grind the Illelish away and hold the Solomani, but i
doubt they\'ll retake Terra w/ Illelish hanging around.   The Hivers make a
deal w/ the Solomani and declare neutrality to avoid attack. They probably
begin manipulating just about everyone.  
       That\'s how i\'d see it going, anyways.

RE:  Astropolitical Influences of the Number 4


I am delighted to learn that you, too, have noted the interesting situation
that every integer is the sum of no more than four squares.  So far as we
have been able to determine, this was first conclusively proven by the
Solomani comrade Lagrange.  Interesting, yes?  The very same person who
discovered the stable orbital points so useful in building large space
habitats and other facilities.  Clearly this is not a coincidence.  You
will note that she made the former proof in the Solomani year 1770, and
that the standard Imperial astrography is constructed so as to contain a
coordinate marked 1770 in each sector.  We suggest an immediate armed
reconnaissance of all such locations.

(I\'m sure you will agree that Solomani-derived cartography exhibits many
interesting encodings of 4 -- the subsector grid within a sector (4x4 or
4^2 ?), for example -- all of which demand serious analysis.)

The signficance of only one in six of all numbers actually _requiring_ four
squares is unclear to us.  Clearly, 4^n(8m+7) is worthy of further study
and interpretation vis-a-vis the secret patterning of space settlement.

Furthermore, you will note that the probable solution to the "map coloring
problem" (as described by Solomani mathematicians) is four.  To us this
suggests (if proven) that the secular profusion of geopolitical units on
the interstellar map are reducible to four unique and perfectly
noncontiguous power blocs.  Our colleagues [CLASSIFIED], as you might well
imagine.

I must note that your faith (as I am able to understand it at this time)
may neglect to fully account for the ontonumeric properties of _one_.
Consider, for example, the children\'s game (among us in the Concourse --
your people, too?) of taking any number, forming a new number from the sum
of the squares of its digits, and iterating.  As you know, the sequence
always either lands at 1, or settles into the loop based on 4 (4, 16, 37,
89, 145, 42, 20, 4...).  That is why we in the Concouse [CLASSIFIED] or
until such a time.

Furthermore, as Brocard, another late Solomani comrade, pointed out, n!+1
is a square when n=4 -- that is, 4!+1=5.  Five, yes?  [CLASSIFIED] Guaran
[CLASSIFIED].  Think about it!

Your gift of sulfuric acid bath salts were most appreciated by myself and
other Slimy members of the embassy (though our Sayat comrades did rather
object to its unusually pungent bouquet!), and I hope you will all enjoy
the copper oxide breakfast-cereal flakes which I have taken the liberty of
enclosing.

Um, not me. It\'s your _right_ to have the phone company pay for your
access to the traveller mailing list?  Come again? Or is it just
that you want the people that use the phone for a total of an hour
or two a week to make up the slack for our tying up the phones lines
for hours a day on the net?

The lines have been subsidized (for consumers) by business for
years. All this was based on some average usage (typical call lasts
for so many minutes, people make so many calls per day, etc.). Business
customers pay about twice as much for their service to make rates
cheaper for people in the sticks. It needn\'t be that way now, but it
stuck. Now you\'ve got people tying up a line all the time and they expect 
to pay the same amount as my grandmother who makes maybe a call a day
for 10 minutes?

They should charge us all _more_ and charge people who use the phone
as a phone _less_ IMHO. I wouldn\'t use the net nearly as much if I
was paying for it by the minute, but I don\'t consider the internet
as a requirement for existance, either. Using the "then only the
rich can use the net" arguement is silly----by definition anybody with 
a grand or two to spend on a computer isn\'t missing any meals (and if 
they are they should\'ve spent their couple grand on food instead of a
computer).

Well Dave, the only reason I\'m wondering is because Silicon Valley News
while not \'big\', isn\'t a tabloid either.  I\'d think they would have
their information correct before publishing?

Anyway, I\'m still waiting for a response from them.

This is the same news service that *admitted* to being totally suckered by the
CIA created the Crack market in California, isn\'t it?  (thats rhetorical, they
did).

I hope you get a response to your query.  Too many news reports aren\'t investigated or challenged in
such a straightforward manner.  Kudos to you.

> If indeed the FCC is trying to shove everyone off the internet and make

I don\'t see how anyone can believe this, at least with regard to motive.  The net is a tool for
commerce.  The rich get richer by making it cheap and easy.  While I agree that the Telcos\' profit
motive might finagle its way into some form of excise, that is the way of commerce.  They\'ll charge what
the market can bear, if they are allowed to, but the market pressures are likely to keep that extremely
low.  Hell, most big city telcos already have hidden charges per minute for even local calls outside of
your closest exchanges.

Plus, many government departments don\'t want to see any such scheme established.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration is part of the Department of Commerce and
is dedicated to *not* regulating the internet until there is a demonstrated need.  Larry Irving, the
adminstrator for that organization, was on CSPAN this weekend making a vociferous case for not
regulating without a demonstrated harm and explaining how the growth of the internet has helped american
business.  His tone was very interesting.  He seemed to have a sincere distaste for Telcos and others
wanting regulations, calling them and their lawyers "K Street Boys" and the "Briefcase Boys."  He showed
how the NTIA\'s efforts at keeping the internet deregulated were helping the "Blue Jeans Boys."  So, even
if the FCC hoax/ non-hoax, whatever, can be believed, all of the government agencies aren\'t on the samge
page (which I think is a good thing in this context).

Well, no one wants to pay more than they have to, but capitalism, i.e., "Free" trade, is based on
charging as much as you can get.  If the FCC decides to let the Telcos make a little more, sure no one
supports that, and no one will unless and until the Telcos can demonstrate the real financial need.  And
since that just aint gonna happen, I don\'t think you have to worry about your freedom being taken away
from you.  Not. Much.

Well I may not be very cognizant of phone billing policy, but upping the
\'ante\' on Internet usage
may very well price me out of the ballpark.  You may be for "by the
minute" surcharges like when you make long-distance calls but I am not. 
It\'s that very surcharge that keeps me from making them at all.

Also, you may not think the internet is necessary for most, and likely
you are right.  However I do some of my business on the Web, and in the
future will be doing more.  The Internet has allowed me to do things I
could not have done in the small town I live in.

I did spend a small fortune on my computer, but have done so over the
past 3 years.  Because I don\'t have a lot of money to spend I have
painstakenly put together my system using my tax returns.  So to me,
"only the rich" is not a silly arguement.  If they do make it charge by
the minute, I\'ll have to stop using the Internet.
As you say, "(and if they are they should\'ve spent their couple grand on
food instead of a computer)."

Very true.

Well so many on this list have been adamant about this being a hoax, and
all things being equal, Occam\'s Razor is in full effect here.  The only
reason I give the rumour any credence is, as you say, "but capitalism,
i.e., "Free" trade, is based on charging as much as you can get.".  This
is most certainly true, and GREED will always play a big part in
commerce.  That seems only \'human\'.

Thank you for your informative message.  I wasn\'t aware of some of that
stuff.

I use the net ofr commerce as well, but that\'s a business expense
and either comes out of the revenues or you don\'t have a real
business (I\'m dancing on the edge of this myself :-). In any case
unless you really need to be online a lot, your web site can still
collect orders, or tell clients about what you do regardless of the
phone rates (some cheaper solution would appear anyway, so this is
moot :-). In that case all you need to do is dump your mail a few
times a day----shouldn\'t cost very much even long-distance.

Based on a trip to my local AAB for consultation with Ancient Mysteries of
Past Imperiums (viz Peter\'s *sob* complete-but-for-Hivers collection of
Aliens modules), this was more-or-less what happened with the Darrians, the
Sword Worlders and the area that later became the Julian
Confederation/League of Antares, except that it was Solomani corporate
interests, rather than nobles per se.

If they do improve their RoM TL from 12 up to 13, then there are Canon
problems IMO, because this technology would "leak" back into the 3rd
Imperium, which contacted all these societies at a fairly early date (yeah,
yeah, I know the Darrians made TL16, but then they blew up their sun by
accident and things went downhill for a long while). The Imperium would
then reverse-engineer or have a target to aim at, and thus raise their TL
faster. 

Generally, the RoM\'s TL of 12 was as good as it got anywhere until year 350
or so.

There are people, notably Leroy Gautney, who disagree and claim the RoM
achieved a higher level of technology (ie general 14, 15 in some fields).

A compromise position is the RoM had a general TL of 12, and a TL of 14 in
medicine, robotics and genetic engineering, while the Third Imperium was
one TL behind it\'s "norm" in these fields due to social pressures against
these technologies.

>What information is out there about the ROM? I have none of the MetaTrav
>books, how much and what books contain, information partaining to the fall
>of the ROM? Is there anyone else out there working in this millieu?

The "canon" description of why the RoM fell was economic collapse as the
Terrans stuffed up 8000 years of careful Vilani imperial management with
newfangled technologies, techniques and methods of orginisation. The
"keystone" event was in -1776 when the RoM central trasury disallowed on of
the subsiduary mint\'s currency issues. This caused a collapsed of
interstellar trade etc etc

Me, I dont think this would have been enough to explain the collapse. Even
also given a disintegration of the delicate Vilani web of trade and
maintainence relationships (anyone else think the Vilani Empire was a
feudal technocracy that maintained tight central control on starships and
fusion drive manufacture and maintainence ?), such a financial collapse
wont kick you into a Long Night.

It\'ll hurt, but as long as you have TL8/9 contragravity you can easily get
out of gravity wells, and a single TL9 A starport world can build enough
starships to keep quite a lot of trade going at a low level. Lo-tech
low-thrust drives and Hohmann transfer orbits will allow access to system
resources, even at TL8, assuming access to some contragravity.

I suspect that the historians and propagandists of the early Third Imperium
painted the Long Night as blacker than it actually was - I suspect that
whilst interstellar trade and contact would have fallen by 90-95%, it still
happened throughout the Long Night.

Assuming a jump-2 TL11 ship that needs maintainence every 52 weeks, that
means you can jump out for 26 weeks before having to come back to your base
for maintainence. At a jump every 12 days, this translates to about 30
parsecs. With a B starport at the other end, that means you can be 60
parsecs between depots.

What would do it is a secular increase in misjump chances to, say, 3% per
jump. This means a lethal misjump is a probability every 10 years which
leads to much shorter horizons for ship repayment and a higher salaries for
spacers to compensate them for this risk.

Neat theory, but Lucan was, in effect, both the third-string quarterback
and not that smart.

I doubt he had the contacts to do what Dulinor (an Imperial Archduke and
good mate of the Emperor) couldnt do.

Me, I\'d suspect the Imperial Chaimberlain, the Naval Chief of Staff and so
on. I wonder, were any of them in on it, and if so who was planning to
double-cross Dulinor ?

On the other hand, what if Dulinor had Varian as the inside man ?

In any case, Dulinor\'s flight was IMO an admission of illegitimacy. He had
to stay, and win a Moot vote by whatever means, or risk Lucan, Margaret or
whoever getting the Imperium-wide legitimacy that Moot ratification brings.

Once he fled, the coup had failed, and the Second Iliesh Revolt was on.

the civil war. What I need to know is what events must I include to avoid

What I am thinking of is bending the economics rules in the latest THUDD -
namely, do the route as written *but* have a trade station on each planet,
with the plan being the ship jumps in, meets up with the on-planet broker
who gives them the new speculative cargo, collects their old one, and then
spends a week selling it while the ship is doing it\'s job travelling
between the stars.

The cycle then repeats at each planet, with the idea being to avoid having
this big expensive asset sitting on the tarmac/in orbit as much as possible.

I figure with such a system you would be able to have a 24 hour turnaround,
thus making the average trip time 10 days rather than 15.

This will do wonderful things to profitability.

I am figuring a on-planet Factor would get paid say Cr 5000 a month, and
the office and warehouse space would cost a similar amount - maybe twice
this at an A starport, 75% at a C starport, 50% at a D and at an E he is
the facility.

What do people think ?

I doubt it - the various sources on the Zhodani make it clear the Frontier

Aside from the manipulation aspect, why should the Hive get involved at
all? And why should the Solomani risk provoking them especially as they
control at least double the space of the Confederation.

>       That\'s how i\'d see it going, anyways.

I\'d disagree with some of your conclusions - eg Daibei. Dulinor will take
time to crush but he will be crushed. If Strephon survived (or there was a
legitimate heir backed by the Moot) the Solomani would probably terminate
their offensive after retaking Terra as the moderates in the Council would
not want to go toe to toe.

Additionally, the Old Expanses fleet may well have been left in place by a
sane heir who listened to military advisers. Daibei can be resupplied
through Diaspora, especially as I assume that Margaret would not split off
from the Imperium if there was a legitimate heir backed by the Moot. You
are talking a period of years to contain the revolt but the Industrial
might of the Imperium should win.

Incidentally, what if the Imperium trades Terra for Solomani peace?

I\'ve just been going through the Core sector data in M0 in detail, and

(Note there is a second Keshi at 0816 but this seems to correspond to the
heart of the Interstellar Confederacy)

The problem worlds are Santry and Cordova...

Interstellar Confederacy (-684 to -1)

Location	World
0622	Sketola (Capital)
0812	Protalus
0714	Marsus
1524	Fr\'now (I assume this is the F\'now refered to on page 10)

1317	Belicose
0916	Heraldia
1316	Shibasiim
1120	Eorvin
0112	Ye-Lu

I could not find Velpare in the sector listing.

Note the IC should contain 32 worlds by -623

Note the position of Sketola compared to the other powerhouses of the IC
(Marsus and Protalus) 9 parsecs as the crow flys(!!!!) and 12 or 14 by
fastest J2 route (and 6 jumps). A more logical location for the capital
would be obtained if Sketola was in 0612.

The Santry/Cordova cluster

1736	Santry
1836	Cordova

These are in the middle of the Chanestin Kingdom\'s cluster, which I would
argue means that it would be swamped and fall during the Chanestin/Sylean
wars.

So has anyone come up with fixes to match the text to the data?

I\'m sure I read *somewhere* in the MT material (be it TD/MTJ or a DGP/GDW
book) that Dulinor had requested a private audience and the Aslan
ambassador was asked to stay behind by Strephon. I may be wrong though.

I agree with that - different evolutionary backgrounds, different
biochemistry. Biochem is that complex, I know that, I studied some of it.
But some similarities have to be kept: All life as we know it in the
Traveller Universe uses biochemistry. And, as found in the Astrochemistry,
some amino and nucleic acids have a) been found in space and b) could be
made by only choosing the proposed conditions on pre-age earth.
So those little molecules should exist on quite a lot of worlds.
So even Aslan, K\'Kree and Hiver could use parts of the same nucleic acids
for their DNA and make proteins from amino acids, only the transkriptase
will work in an other way. Who knows if Yaskoydray took aout some of his
DNA and put it into human- (and vargr-)kind?
So, what I want to say, as those little molecules are likely to exist on
other worlds, and life is based on little ones as on the macromolecules,
they will also have effects on alien life. That these effects are very
different, I agree, will be right. Think again of the shown molecules:

> >> Coffee - coffeine
> >> Tea    - teine
> >> Cacao  - theobromine
> >> Chocl. - theophylline

If you examine their chemical structure, you will find similarities, as
these are derivatives of one another. The alkaloids are such a big class
of molecules that all have effects on human life. So why wouldn\'t they on
aliens, too?

Ok, we can discuss that on and on. That\'s why I asked for more molecules.

L.A.

P.S. The resemblance of Aslan - Cats I think comes from the oftern used
feline aliens in the SF. You don\'t want to say you didn\'t think of lions,
when you invented this race for Traveller, did you?

On another subject from a while back. There was discussion about the
effects
of a black globe used while in Jump. If I remember, it was decided that
something terrible would happen to the ship (destruction, misjump, etc.)
After re-reading my CT books I came across a paragraph describing black
globes. (I believe it was in starship book #3) Anyways, it mentioned ships
coming out of jump with their black globes on. Is this an oversight in the
writing of the book or is it actually possible to have a black globe on
while in jump?
>>

Black globes didn\'t appear in CT until Book 5 (OK, Adventure 1 if you want
to get picky). There\'s a reference in some later work (TNE Regency
Sourcebook?) to black globed ships emerging from jump, coasting up on an
unsuspecting planet which could only detect them by stellar occultation,
and frying them with meson fire. Can\'t remember if they had to exit jump
before switching the globes on.

Sounds like a *bad* porn novel I kept because it was *so* bad. They
rather obviously took a story that was hetero and converted it to
"lesbian" by using global search and replace. With *no* further
editing... This makes for stuff that has to be seen to be believed!

On the other hand, it has been shown that the *incremental* cost* of
added usage is just about nil. That is, since we are mostly (ab)using
the lines *outside* business hours, we aren\'t affecting the required
amount of equipment.

Remember, the line between your computer and the phone switch is
*dedicated (except in a *very* small number of cases). So it costs the
same whether you use it or not.

The resources in the switch tend to either be essentially dedicated
(like your line) or to be dependent on the *rate* at which calls are
made (line finders, for example). That is, they get used for a bit at
the start and end of a call, and not at all *during* it. We certainly
aren\'t hurting *those*. And there are resources that depend on the
number of *simultaneous* calls, that is, the number of calls currently
in progress. These are mostly line cards and interoffice trunks.

But, as I noted above, the peak number of calls is still during the
business day, not "after hours" when we are essentially using the
"spare" capacity required to handle the *peak* call volume during the
day.

Our "long calls" *aren\'t* costing extra. But the LECs sure would like
to be able to *charge* extra.

The system I\'m using at the moment has exactly *three* parts that I paid
*any* money for. One is the keyboard, it\'s from a system I bought back
when I made more money. I could easily swap it out for one of the ones
I\'ve been given. The second is the SCSI card. I paid about $50 for it
in 1992. The third is the modem. It\'s a 14.4 and I paid $20 for it a
couple of years back. 

I\'m running a 386DX40, 20 meg of RAM, with a 640meg HD and 350 meg HD,
VGA (VGA mono monitor). 

And the *software* I\'m using at the moment was free as well. I\'m
running OpenDOS, and some freeware uucp software and a freeware
newsreader. 

I know a *lot* of folks with mail/news access to the net who couldn\'t
*begin* to afford a grand from their computer. One of the reasons I
have so much donated stuff is because I help put systems together for
low income folks. So I get given a lot of "obsolete" computer gear.

And most of those low income folks get their access via a BBS I help
run. The uucp link for that system is donated by an ISP I know. 

"Per minute" charges would kill *all* of that.

that could be *confused* with that. 

One is letting the LECs (local phone companies) charge ISPs the same
fees that are charged IXCs (long distance carriers) for connecting to
them. This is something like 3.5 cents a minute per line. (That\'s why
you don\'t see LD rates dropping much anymore, the IXC has to pay the
LEC at *each* end of the call 3.5 cents a minute. Which means that if
they charged *nothing* the bill would be 7 cents/minute).

I can\'t recall the details of the other, but it has to do with applying
some regulations that normally only apply to phone companies to ISPs.

Ask the FCC for info about the "public comments being solicited
regarding regulations regasrding ISPs". 

Note that they are *not* even at the rule making stage. They are jusat
trying to find out what the public thinks about the subject. In other
words, doing some "fact finding" before deciding *if* they want to
write some rules.

The four color theorem was proven sometime in the last two decades of
the 20th century (Solomani reckoning). I don\'t have the references
handy to pin it down any closer than probably being in the period 1985
to 1995.

Uhhh the Mercury News has been known to be wrong before...IIRC that\'s the
paper that published the now-discredited CIA-Contras-Crack story.

The per-minute charges that the telcos wanted were essentially a
bargaining ploy to get the favorable stuff they got in the 1996
Telecommunications Bill, like being able to get into the long distance
business, while still maintaining their local monopolies. That one\'s up in
front of the Supreme Court real soon now.

There are constant rumblings from the telcos to the FCC that they want
ISP\'s declared common carriers, like the Long Distance companies, which
brings ISP\'s into a whole new ballgame of regulation and fees such as the 
universal access rules (one reason the Govt allows those  filthy telco
monopolies in the first place).

Unfortunately, they\'ll have a REALLY hard time with this argument in front
of the FCC because, unlike long distance companies, who tie into the local
telcos at the customer level, all an ISP is is a business line customer.
They rent phone lines from the telcos like any other business. If the
telcos get ISPs declared common carriers, _any_ business that rents a
bunch of lines to provide end user services to us suckers  errr.. local
 telco customers could be declared such. 

It doesn\'t matter if the company is providing me digital access, camping
gear from LL Bean or phone sex, all of them operate on the same business
model. I have to call their number to get anything, unlike long distance
service which is a network that uses the entire local telco network to
provide service (all I do is dial the end number I want to reach). 

The telcos are whining as usual about how  ISP\'s put excess loads on thier
networks, but tough sh*t...that\'s part of the cost of doing business.
Since they\'re the only game in town, I really can\'t muster any sympathy
for them. Neither, I suspect, will the FCC. The telcos pet
congresscritters, OTOH, will sell us out in a heartbeat.

Living that blighted land known as the US West (US Pest) service area may
have affected my views of these companies, however. 

I feel the same way about outher legalized monopolies, like cable systems.
It\'s odd, the great cable deregulation of two years ago, which everyone
claimed would result in lower costs and better service, have gotten us
three price increases and fewer channels Grrrr....

One thing you may want to keep in mind: By the time the Solomani takes
Terra THEY are the invaders. In 1105 Terra is about to become a fully
fledged member of the Imperium, all relationships normal. This should
have been accomplished by 1116. Now, do you imagine that the Solomani
leadership is going to \'liberate\' Terra and turn over the Confederation
to the Mother World? Not on your life. They\'re going to start hunting
down "collaborators" and generally behave like invaders throughout time
and space. Except for a tiny minority of fanatics, everybody on Terra
is going to long for the Good Old Days of the Imperium. If the Imperium
gets its act together quickly enough, they may be able to perforn a
genuine liberation of Earth, backed by a massive local support...

Interesting.  I\'m in the planning stages for a CT campaign (using MT
rules) set in Glisten/District 268/Five Sisters on the eve of the FFW. 
I\'ve decided that the PCs will crew a Far Trader, and will be members of
a \'Trade Cooperative\' with several other ships.  This will give them
several advantages:
1. Warehouse and office space in several of their ports.
2. Brokers on retainers in several ports.
3. Better freight availability.  They can depend on the other ships in
the cooperative for a source of freight.  They will be able to make
better deals with freight originators ("We can carry your freight all
the way to the destination on our ships.")
4. Better able to compete against the larger shippers, such as Al Moria.

Frankly, I don\'t see why your typical PC traders always have to \'go it
alone\'.  Economically, it doesn\'t make sense.

Partly, yes. Aslan were also partly inspired by Japanese and Muslim warrior
societies, and partly from a few other things.

I apologize if I am over-reacting, but I get a litle tired of people
concluding that Aslan (or other SF feline aliens) behave like cats because
they look like cats. We used to get questions all the time about this. One
JTAS submission lo these many years ago described the most popular Aslan
childrens\' toy as being a large ball of yarn. 

I agree with the comments that the various compounds _may_ have similar
effects on humans, aslan, etc. I simply disagree with the notion that they
_must_ have nearly identical effects. 

Part of the fun is coming up with reasons why each race is slightly unique --
I think we all agree on that?

   The Internet Service Providers are already paying for access.  Since I
already pay my ISP for access, what you are advocating is in essence double
billing.  No thanks.

>They should charge us all _more_ and charge people who use the phone
>as a phone _less_ IMHO.

   I don\'t recall my cable TV company offering me a rebate because I don\'t
watch as much TV as the family down the street, or I don\'t watch all the
channels they provide me.  It is an access issue, not a bandwidth issue.
Those who would like to turn it into a bandwidth issue stand to make huge
profits (far beyond the cost of necessary upgrades to the existing system)
if there were a change here in the US.

   As for grandma, no offense (in fact we\'ll make a generic grandmother),
but people such as her are a dying breed (and no pun intended).  Access to
phone and data lines is increasing with each generation and shows no sign of
slowing down.

   Ultimately however, you can go ahead and raise the tax to $10.00 a minute
for all I care--soon everyone will have the ability to switch their method
of accessing the Internet and phone service to cable, and when the phone
companies are dying off and begging people to come back, I\'ll smile and wish
them luck in the unemployment line.

   You don\'t, but chances are your children will, and without question your
grandchildren will wonder how you lived without it.

   Real world example: Here at the University of Kentucky, if you want a
copy of the Employee Handbook or Human Resources updates, don\'t expect that
a paper copy will find its way into your inbox.  All of that kind of stuff
is posted on a Web site.  Our new library, which opens in a few months, will
have power outlets and dataports at 50 percent of all the seats.  I could go
on...

   With computer prices crashing through the US$1,000 barrier, telling
someone that they have to then pay hundreds of extra dollars a year just
because they use the Internet to do more than just quickly download e-mail
each day and look up the weather and sports scores is truly silly, and so is
charging people extra just because you can.

as possible.

Ian,
	This subject hits my hot button.  I\'m from the \'orbital
segregation\' school of thought.  In the universe you have Spacers and
you have Groundhogs.  Although there are exceptions, the two generally
don\'t mix.

	The question comes down to can you trust your factor? There are
displacement tons of adventure ideas right there!

	So, who\'s going to be the factor?  

- --A local?  You\'re just asking to get hung out to dry.  If they aren\'t
some undercover treasury agent or a bomb-building counter-clockwise
radical, they will get called by thier sick Aunt Mnbwa to rake Zobian
tasty-root on the Southern Continent.  The only thing you\'ll have to
fill your cargo bay with is air with whatever local taint they can\'t get
rid of.

- --A Spacer?  If the locals don\'t castigate him, and if he stays sober,
AND if he doesn\'t blow all the money at the track/aquarium.

Face it, the only way to make a profit out in the Imperium is to do it
face-to-face.  Stay Alert, Trust no one, Keep your Sandcaster handy.

I recall reading that telephone companies want ISPs declared common

With that food for thought, can we _PLEASE_ drop the topic and return

By all means let us split hairs...
     
Valerian (shrub), common name for a family of plants of the teasel order, 
and especially for any of various perennial shrubs or herbs of the 
representative genus, native to mainly cool, northern temperate regions.
     
Valerians vary in height from 0.6 to 1.5 m (2 to 5 ft) and have thick, 
acrid-smelling roots and either simple or lobed leaves. The small pink or 
white flowers grow in dense clusters and are often highly fragrant. The 
common valerian, or garden heliotrope, native to Europe and northern Asia, is 
cultivated as an ornamental; its roots are the source of a sedative drug. It 
is unrelated to true heliotropes.
     
Scientific classification: Valerians make up the family Valerianaceae. The 
representative genus is Valeriana. The common valerian, or garden 
heliotrope, is classified as Valeriana officinalis.

    'body' => '	I have been reading an old series of books called "Foundation" written by
Isaac Asimov around 1952.  It high lights the effects of a galactic empire
that is brought down by rebellion, slowing economics, and a general
distrust of the impersonal Imperial government.  The series highlights the
foreshadowed knowledge of such an occurrence which under \'normal\'
circumstances would have left the galaxy in ruins for well over 30,000
years.  But one man\'s psycohistoric examination and projections would lead
a small group of scientists to \'preserve\' knowledge through the Long night
following the collapse of the interstellar Imperium.  (Sound a little
traveller like yet?)
	The point to the preservation of this knowledge would be to greatly
shorten the period of time that the galaxy would remain in a state of
barbarism.  The projected period of time would only last 1000 years rather
than the 30k that was first assumed. (Sound any more like traveller yet?)

	As I read through each of the novels it corresponds loosely with the idea
of ROM and the long night.  I thought to myself that this series would make
for an excellent background for a Pocket Empire campaign as well as
Traveller or Imperial Squadrons, but I lean more towards the idea of Pocket
Empires.  The series is a good source for additional mileu ideas for the
period of time spanning the end of ROM to the beginning of the Mileu 0
campaign.  Who knows, maybe the Foundation was a Jump Start Cache left by
one of the governments who foresaw the end of the ROM and the beginning of
the Long night.  Maybe even Cleon had "discovered" the Foundation\'s hiding
spot and utilized their knowledge to help start the Third Imperium...


	I highly recommend the series for those of you who keep an open mind in
regards to the \'grey area\' caused by holes in the Traveller background.  I
also recommend the series for those of you who are interested in intrigue
and \'Empire Building\' type literature than the \'hack and slash\' first
person approach at stories.

When the modem tax "hoax" started, it wasn\'t a hoax at the time.  The whole
thing was shot down by the federal government in short order.  The fact that
the letters persisted into the early 90s made it a hoax.

Although, in the same vein, I miss those halcyon days when BBSes roamed the
earth freely (*sigh*)...  There\'s under a dozen BBSes in the Philadelphia area
now, and the activity level is extremely low.

I agree with you wholeheartedly. If you haven\'t read C.J.Cherryh I suggest
you check her out. (Particularly "Merchanter\'s Luck", in this instance.) I
generally follow her economic model/setting. She has "trade combines"
which are collections of ships. They don\'t so much have facilities on the
different worlds but rather bank accounts. It is more important in her
universe.

My players decided they wanted to play "Han and Chewie wannabies". So
they are skut crew on Tramp Freighter. They spend most of their time
locked into their area of the ship by the senior (permanent) crew. The ship
isn\'t a Pirate, rather it services pirates. A smuggler, or fencer, etc,
etc.

I\'ll be keeping location notes and so forth in Jim Vassilikos\'s Galactic.
If
you like we (anyone else running something here right now?) can share
write-ups though this.

I would LOVE to share notes.  I too am using Galactic, and while the
world writeups that come with the 2.3 distribution are a great start, I
noticed that many of the writeups are for the TNE error (uhm... make
that \'era\' :o), and there are no writeups for the Five Sisters subsector
at all.  Do you have a source of such writeups that I can use as a
jumpstart?

I\'ve read Cherryh, but not that particular book.  I read the Chanur
series, and a couple others.  Yeah, it\'s great source material for
Traveller.

As I said, I\'d love to.  Let me know how I can help, and what specific
info you\'re looking for.

If anyone on TML can give either of us pointers to world writeups for
Glisten/District 268/Five Sisters, we\'d appreciate it.

Marc, I think you\'re missing a great opportunity here..  Getting people to
sign away their souls for first crack at the Traveller CD would seem to be
an excellent way to garner playtesters and booth slaves for IG.

On the topic of booth slaves, is IG going to have a presence at GenCon this
year?  I\'ll be there in my Marine Force Leader\'s uniform (0-3).. I just got
the rough of my MCG back from the guy who is casting it; This costume

I can\'t imagine that happening, especially with Iphengia on the throne.
Iphengia would have been unready for the seat, and might have been
manipulated by senior Naval officers away from any appeasement of the
Solomani.  The Confederation is the only real threat faced by the Imperium
in the early 12th Century.. The Zhodani make contact with the Imperial
border on a very narrow front (one Subsector, basically), and seem to be
fighting wars only to keep the Imperium at bay.  The Vargr are too
disorganized to present a credible threat, the Aslan and Imperium are
separated by Reaver\'s Deep sector, as are the K\'Kree, who also are a full
sector away.  Who knows what the Hivers are doing.  No, it\'s the Solomani
who are in the Admiralty\'s mind.

Once the Second Illeish Revolt is suppressed, I wouldn\'t put it past the
Navy to manufacture an incident to provoke a war with the Solomani to
settle the question once and for all.  These Admirals all grew up on
stories of the Solomani Rim War, and are eager to cover themselves with glory.

Strephon had just finished greeting the Aslan ambssador, and was to meet
with him privately after recieving Dulinor.  On impulse, the Emperor
invited the Ambassador to remain in the Octogon with him for what was to be
a brief meeting.

TD#9 has Dulinor stripping Strephon of the crown before a horrified

What are peoples views on how much it would cost to rent office
and warehouse space in a starport ?

What I am thinking of is bending the economics rules in the
latest THUDD -namely, do the route as written *but* have a trade station 
oneach planet, with the plan being the ship jumps in, meets up with the 
on-planet broker who gives them the new speculative cargo, collects 
their old one, and then spends a week selling it while the ship is doing 
it\'s job travelling between the stars.

The cycle then repeats at each planet, with the idea being to
avoid having this big expensive asset sitting on the tarmac/in orbit as 
much as possible.

I figure with such a system you would be able to have a 24 hour 
turnaround, thus making the average trip time 10 days rather than 15.

This will do wonderful things to profitability.

I am figuring a on-planet Factor would get paid say Cr 5000 a month, and 
the office and warehouse space would cost a similar amount - maybe twice 
this at an A starport, 75% at a C starport, 50% at a D and at an
E he is the facility.

What do people think ?>>

<<<This subject hits my hot button.  I\'m from the \'orbital segregation\'

Ian:

Your idea is exactly what one of my trading groups does.  The benefactor 
is a count in the Lunion System, who put up the capital for the initial 
downpayments....  His goal is to build a Sector-Wide trading firm, with 
eventual goals of spanning the empire (might take a few generations, but 
hey, it\'ll run in the family).

The group has grown to 5 ships already, with the captains aboard (mostly 
people he knew from career days) becoming part owners in the company.  
We are working on the factor issue right now (do they become owners 
too?)  

This is how I see the other Subsector and Sector wide lines beginning.  
Your theories of keeping your productive assets producing and your back 
office support supporting is what business is all about.  Besides, if 
you are running speculative business activities too, you may need to 
store some cargo for a while in one of your own warehouses for further 
transfer to another ship going down another "route".  

Keep it up!  Now, where we don\'t really agree, the group has also 
purchased a patrol cruiser for defense against pirates/corporate 
raiders.  Having the count\'s deep pockets has helped too.

Question.  I remember reading somewhere in published material about how 
much a royal\'s holdings should provide him/her on an annual basis, and 
the problems of taxes, and whether or not he is away from the fiefdom, 
etc.  Anybody else remember that?

I\'d guess about Cr20/m3 for office space, Cr10/m3 for \'plain\' warehouse
space -- but that\'s off the top of my head.  A smallish office (like, say,
a typical minimall real estate office, for example) occupies about 3x10x5
m = 150 m3, for a monthly rent of Cr3000, which seems reasonable.  This
figure would be much higher at low TLs, when volume aboard space
facilities is at a premium, but is probably reasonable for TL 10+ or so.

I\'ve long taken for granted that this is the natural next step in the
evolution of a trading company.  Free traders operate in marginal niches,
covering no fixed route, without local support at the worlds they visit,
relying on luck with speculative trade to get buy.  Many go bankrupt.

Those free traders that make a healthy profit (and are both smart and
business-inclined enough) plow the money back into developing a trade
infrastructure such as you describe, maintaining brokers on each planet
they routinely visit to have cargoes ready for them when they arrive.
Frequently the warehouse area near the starport is full of tiny, run-down
offices run by contract brokers, each holding accounts with ten or more
small (1 to 3 ship) trading companies which visit the world.

The next stage beyond this is becoming a full-fledged independent shipping
company, with a small fleet of vessels and separate, company-owned
offices and full-time brokers at each major port.

Needless to say, each step along this ladder decreases the scope of
adventure opportunities.  A lone free trader can wander around at will,
taking on odd jobs and \'special cargoes\' to stay one jump ahead of the
creditors.  A larger trade company, however, will have fixed routes and
schedules in order to fulfill contractual obligations and meet wider
company goals.  (Lando Calrissian\'s conversation with Han Solo from
\'The Empire Strikes Back\' comes to mind.)  That\'s why many GMs skew events
to keep free traders \'hungry\', never letting them accumulate enough cash
to \'settle down\' and become respectable.

> This will do wonderful things to profitability.

Yep.  It\'s yet another example of the old maxim, "It takes money to make
money."

I came up with my figures without reading yours, and it seems we\'re in
rough agreement.  I like making the price depend on starport quality in
addition to TL.  Note also that I was assuming orbital facilities; for
on-planet facilities, halve my numbers and eliminate the TL dependency.

Los Alamos develops microsatellites

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 8, 1997 - How small can you make a satellite?

About half an ounce is the startling answer from a team of Los Alamos
National Laboratory researchers who are designing cheap microsatellites with
control systems based on the simplest "twitches" of animal neurons.

These insect-like space vehicles could open up important new space missions,
said Kurt Moore and co-authors Janette Frigo and Mark Tilden in a paper
presented today at the American Geophysical Union\'s semi-annual meeting. The
paper was part of a session entitled "Science Closure and Enabling
Technologies for Magnetospheric Constellation Missions."

The Los Alamos control systems are designed first and foremost to survive,
then to do useful work.

"Instead of designing systems that withstand their environment, we are
engineering systems that rely on their environment," Moore said.

Among potential missions are measuring solar wind or capturing more precise
images of Earth\'s features.

From the earliest days of space exploration, engineers made vehicles whose
primary function was to anticipate and overcome the harsh environment of
space. The Los Alamos team has built tiny robotic controllers that survive
in almost any environment.

Nearly half of costly, complex satellites have failed recently due to loss
of their links with Earth control stations, often a result of space
radiation wiping out delicate on-board microprocessors. Satellites increase
in vulnerability as they increase in rigidity and complexity of design,
Moore said.

"We\'re working on satellites that have no microprocessors or fixed
algorithmic behaviors," Moore said. "Instead, these satellites are survivors
- - designed from the bottom up and domesticated by their sensors and control
payloads into performing high-reliability tasks."

These robust microsatellites represent the logical end of one evolutionary
trend in space exploration - toward clusters of small, cheap satellites that
can achieve results even when some of them fail, Moore said. Microsatellites
are so robust that they even could be used to investigate the Van Allen
radiation belts, which most Earth-orbiting satellites avoid.

The control systems are based on simple "nervous nets," an instinct-like
neural net in which a single electronic neuron is sufficient to produce a
control pulse, or twitch, in a robotic creature lacking an advanced
processor or computer commands.

Tilden, a robotics engineer, found that with just two neurons he could
create a walking, insect-like robot with remarkable survival skills. With
larger arrays of a few neurons, Tilden made larger, more sophisticated
walkers controlled by central pattern generators that were directly coupled
to the environment.

Nervous nets work like the neurons in animal nervous systems, which put out
spiked pulses that hold useful information in the timing between the pulses.
In computer terms, the information needed to do work lives in the firing
rate, not in a coded voltage level.

The more than 200 types of legged robots Tilden built with these central
pattern generators - which work like the simple independent control loop
that sends
messages from one insect leg to the next to keep the creature moving - have
proven reliable, nearly impervious to electrical and mechanical fault and
surprisingly capable of self assembly and collective behavior.

The Los Alamos model demonstrated at AGU is a microsatellite controller
whose primary mission is to orient itself in Earth\'s magnetic field. Using
only a few
transistors, these space \'bots seek the brightest available light source,
the sun, and set themselves precisely toward it.

Acting like a delay line, electronic pulses from photodetectors travel first
to one neuron, then the next. By adjusting the timing relationship between
the pulses, the control system seeks the light and uses the reaction of the
controller\'s magnetic field against Earth\'s magnetic field for the torque
needed to orient the satellite.

With six neurons on three axes, the controller can move or examine different
points in three-dimensional space.

Hundreds of microsatellites could relay simple streams of data to a
communications microsatellite, which could integrate the data and pass it on
to a ground station.

Measuring Earth\'s magnetosphere is one potential mission. By locating a
swarm of microsatellites on the sunward side of the magnetopause, scientists
could take
real-time measurements of the energy transferred to Earth\'s magnetic field
by the turbulent solar wind.

"We\'ve never really been able to do real-time monitoring of the position of
the magnetopause as the solar wind pushes it around," Moore explained. "With
hundreds of these microsatellites, we should be able to do that."

Another experiment might place on each microsatellite a single imager
sufficient to gather just one high-resolution piece of an image. By
collecting all the pieces, researchers on the ground could obtain highly
accurate pictures of Earth features.

A half-ounce microsatellite, about three inches in diameter, would be small
enough to orient itself within a single fluctuation in space plasma, Moore said.

"These microsatellites can go where expensive, big satellites can\'t go and
they can perform a class of business and science missions that no other
platform can do," Moore said.

"Nobody knows how little you can go," he said. "That\'s what we aim to find out."

I do not agree that (true) Communism has proven not to work. Where in
the world have we ever had (true) Communism. It goes against the grain
of Capitalism and so must be obliterated by whatever means or so the
feeling goes. No, I,m not a sympathyser.
May I suggest a book - Looking Backward 2000-1887 by Edward Bellamy -
which has a vaque similarity as to how it could be made to work - such
that everyone benefits - equally - but alas it was all just a dream.

I haven\'t been tracking the info on the Chanestin Kingdom. I was going to
get around to placing Santry and Cordova a week or so ago which is when I
noticed that someone had already placed them. Maybe I should just go ahead
a find a place for them and ignore what is in First Survey. After all, it

I didn\'t get the feeling that Kenji believes this either. The smilie -->

	I think robots on board had been quite common in the late 3I,

Starships was Book 2, but now you come to mention it I remember that 
comment. I suggest changing it to activating the BG as the ship re-enters 
real space, or shortly after. Actually, engaging the BG too soon doesn\'t 
give the intruder long enough to check where they are, where they\'re going, 
or what\'s out there, so it\'s a bit pointless.

It\'s going to depend on the Class of port, TL of the world, and the
population.

At a low-TL world, a trader is going to need an office to do business.
A static comm net (the telephone system of the pre-90\'s) will hamper any
kind of non-static place of business.  Records and data access will be
another big factor mandating office space.  Dropping in a high-TL computer
and communications system may not solve this problem either, as the local
government may require (shudder) hardcopy forms and documentation for tax
and business records.

As the TL of the world goes up, the importance of a \'office\' per se, goes
down.  (however, the status of \'having\' an office may go up?)  Eventually,
at TL A or B, the equipment necessary to communicate, transact business,
research information will be small and light enough to be carried on the
person.  The infrastructure of the world will permit mobile
communications, data and currency exchanges, etc....

Location of the office you have is important.  Getting a office near the
landing pads of the downport, or by the docking ring of the highport, will
attract a certain percentage of \'walk-in\' business.  While, I\'m sure, most
traders have specific brokers they do business with in each port, there
will always be the odd trader that needs a broker.  Having an office in a
cut-rate building may save money, but will cut down on the walk-in
business.  (As will not having an office!)

Location is important in other ways.  A broker that does not have some
representation (either personnel or at least advertising) in both the
highport and the downport will miss business.  (Just a side note - IMC, if
the trader is looking for cargo to carry - she/he gets it at either the
highport or the downport.  If they are looking for speculative cargo, they
_must_ go to the downport, or even out onto the planet!)

So far as the highport goes, permanent offices there will be expensive.
Very.  I can see several brokers, specializing in non-competative (or \'not
very\'-competative) fields going in together to rent decent high-port
space.

Finally, population.  I think that it would be safe to say that the higher
the population density, the more office space is going to cost.  At Pop
9+, it may actually be cheaper to get office space in the highport....

Warehousing the cargo...

Hmmm...

The building that houses the cargo containers would be pretty standard.
The incoming cargo could be housed in the temporary facilities provided by
the starport (part of the cr100 you pay) for a week before you would have
to move \'em (hopefully you have sold them by then).  For the goods being
amassed by the on-planet factor, it would be cheaper to use warehousing
off-port (since it\'s from the planet anyway, extra-territoriality should
not be an issue, for transient goods, a bonded warehouse may be
necessary), but if security is an issue then a warehouse in the downport,
or even the highport may be preferred.

Security will be a major cost issue.  The least secure facilies will range
from painted lines on the ground, to a shack with a lock.  More secure
facilities will offer on-site guards.  A step up will include some
electronic protection (to be sure the guards are making their rounds, if
nothing else).  Top of the line security will remove human guardians and
replace them with robots, monitored security, touchpad entry, etc...

The only other thing I would have to say here is that you will lease
either a portion of a warehouse, or an entire warehouse.  If you lease or
buy your own warehouse, you have much more control over it, but you only
have as much space as you have bought.  If you find a great deal on 200
Dtons of cargo, but only have 100 Dtons of warehouse, you are going to be
on the market for more space in a hurry (can you say, expensive?).  On the
other hand, if you lease a portion of someone else\'s warehouse, your
security is going to suffer to a certain extent.  In either case, if you
end up with more space than _you_ need, you can always try and rent that
space out.

Again, this is just a personal campaign issue, but I\'ve always maintained
that consecutive jumps impose a high chance of misjump.  The week between
jumps is time that the engineers use for minor work on the drives, allows
time for the components of the drive to \'cool off\' and stabilize, etc.

Long-term Warehousing:  cr10/ton per month

Substandard: Painted lines or fenced area when sub-leasing in a larger
facility.  Poorly constructed, or weather protection only, if you have
exclusive use of the building. -  base x .5

Standard: Some form of physical separation when sub-leasing in a larger
facility.  Well-constructed building if you have exclusive use of the
building.  Security is provided in the form of locks and the presence of a
(usually unarmed) shared (i.e. several buildings) security patrol. - base

Well, I was wrong about book 3. It was in the MT:Referee\'s Manual. Having
re-read my CT books I had read through MT as well. I just didn\'t remember
right.

Page 96, MT: Referee\'s Manual:
"Suppose, for instance, that a fleet were to jump into a system with its
black globes on and its velocity set upon a predetermined course."

Sounds to me like they can be on while in jump...

I have a question about starship combat in MT concerning the To Hit and To
Pen tables in the Ref\'s Manual.

It says that to hit a target: Difficult, OFF=Computer size, Weapon table DM,
range DM; Def = Def dm (Confrontation)

To Pen: Difficult, Off = computer size, Penetration table DM; Def =computer
size (confrontation)

Does this seem right?

It seems awfully easy to hit and penetrate.

I\'ll use a far trader for example:

Computer model = 1
DefDM +3
Assume triple turret missile launcher TL-13 Factor 3
Sand Caster TL-10 Factor 4

To Hit another ship (same config) It would be difficult, 1 (computer size)
+5 (to hit table); -3 (defDM)
Result: roll 11+ with a DM of +3 (net roll of 8+) 42% chance to hit.

To Pen Sand difficult, 1 (computer size + 5 (to pen table); -1 (computer
size)
Result 11+ with a DM of +5 (net roll of 6+) 72% chance to penetrate.

It seems awfully easy to penetrate. I would have thought it would be easier
to hit and harder to penetrate.

Also, The Ref\'s Manual says that for each Factor the weapon is over the UCP
size of the craft causes a critical hit. (-1 crit for every 3 levels of
armor over 40)

In the above example, the missiles would automatically cause a critical hit.

Does this seem wrong?

I haven\'t seen TNE or T4. Is the starship combat much better? Our group here
play a mix of CT and MT.

And not coincidentally, either.

If I recall correctly, Foundation was one of the main contributing
inspirations for the Imperium and its historical background...

Who of us hasn\'t said something fasicioulsy, only to find in hindsight it
was not that funny.  In fact find that the cute/clever/ironic/sarcastic/etc.
little saying, may have seemed somewhat hateful?  I know I have.  So, I
would like to publicly accept Mr. Golden\'s apology and ask everyone who was
upset over the incident to allow it to die a peaceful death by inattention.

As a newbie, I am somewhat susseptable to the type of hoaxing that may have
been involved in the letter I forwarded to the TML.  However, I am still not
convinced that it was a hoax.  It dovetails with some things I heard on the
news, and is in keeping with some of the things I know about the way
telephone service providers work.  And, I still have not heard anything from
the FCC regarding my first letter of inquiry.  Since I have been having some
trouble with my mail (asside from the TML), it may have simply got lost.  If
someone else out there checked and found out something concrete, I would
appreciate a private forward of the communication.

There is one more thing that may need to be cleared up.  The subject in
question does not seem to be an "FCC Modem Tax", but a proposal to allow
TSP\'s to charge a per minute rate on internet connections.

I have left the above portion of Mr. Golden\'s signature because I, like Mr
Golden^, am proud of the words of the founding fathers of our nation.  No
truer words have been spoken than those of Mr. Paine quoted above.  I hope
that Mr. Golden will consider himself my friend and not my enemy, and I hope
that the animosity will end with his apology and my acceptance of same.

I guess I missed the original of this one.  We have over 100 dial-up BBS\'s

get and/or exchange freeware and shareware.

I used to think that the journalists were responsible, I even wanted to be
one at one time.  In my classes at a well known (for producing qualified
journalists) university here in the heartland, we were taught that making
sure of information was a big part of the journalist\'s job.  However, it
seems that like a lot of other jobs that people go to school for, what you
learn in journalism school may not be applied in real life.

I don\'t know about CT, but in T4, the jump drives require .018 megawatts of
energy per cubic meter of ship in order to keep the bubble of normal space
in tact.  Would it be possible to get that energy to the "jump bubble" with

This is sort of an aside, but it seems to me that a part of this sort of
problem lies in the customary use (shared by lots of other sci-fi) of the
term "race" to describe separate species.  To me, it definitely adds to the
atmosphere of "humans in furry/scaly suits playing at _Daimyos & Damsels_"
(etc.)  Terming these populations as "alien races" suggests that their
difference from us (however "us" might be construed) is of the same degree
as the differences among the pseudobiological social categories within our
species.  Like I Loren says, Aslan have as much in common with humans as
eggplants do; why not call eggplants and lichen "Terran races"?  Because
they\'re not "intelligent" (unlike, for example, elected officials), or
because they\'re harder to dress up actors/NPCs in suits to look like?

This is maybe an efficient way of handling the dearth of intentional
butch/femme porn^H^H^H^H erotica.  (Yes, my un-PC soul will be probably be
darned to the deepest pits of heck for saying such a thing.  See y\'all

I\'m entertaining myself by doing global search-and-replaces on the etext of
"Varney, the Vampyre; or, the Feast of Blood."  It\'s becoming "Varney, the
Bunny Rabbit; or, the Feast of Carrots".

     "The bunny hopped forward into the moonlight, its hideous floppetty
     ears gleaming in the silvery rays, tiding no smurfiness to poor Flora!"

On a similar topic...  I helped proofread a little handbook for the
Japanese sex tour circuit back in the mid-80s.  Japanese-English-Thai.  It
was apparently written by someone living in the early Victorian period.
"Pardon me, madam: are you a harlot?"  "I want to view your bosom.  How
much?"  "Please have a pair of catamites brought to my chambers."  The job
of fashioning it into good modern English was entrusted, in all good but
misplaced faith, to a pair of well-disguised Anglophone pervs, who chortled
evilly over it in their office and emerged to solemnly announce that it
looked fine and fluent just as it was.  ISTR that we did insist that they
offer "lady of the night" as a more genteel alternative to "harlot",
however.

So, I guess, the moral of the story is that human translators aren\'t
intrinsically more reliable than the machines.

I know how you feel, Semo.  I used to run a COMMODORE BBS, and we were
all linked thru our CBASE software to each other all over the USA.  Of
course, unlike fidonet, all us sysops had to pay our own long distance
fees, which got really expensive with all the packet downloading we did.

I haven\'t ran my BBS in 3 years.  Sigh.  The good ole days, eh?  :)

The operative word is _made_, in the sense of _forced_. I think the

Perhaps Aslan children play with things that human children would find

   This is one of those off-topic conversations I *do not* mind being on the
list, since it is something that can effect a large percentage of us, and it
is better to get rumors of pending action (or doom) squashed as quickly as
possible.

   **However**, I will say that it should probably be kept to rumor control
only, not discussions of larger issues, something I\'m going to have call a
\'mea culpa\' on.  Thanks for the reminder.

   Ah yes, I\'d forgotten about that one.  Certainly that provides some canon
explanation as to \'why\'.  My bit comes from Marc, unless of course he\'s
changed his mind since Gencon a year and a half ago.  :-)

   Well *automation* certainly (in "T4" FF&S terms, \'high\' automation versus
\'normal\' automation), and late in the Rebellion that might have included
robots as trained crew became increasingly harder to find.

   You have to remember as well that those crew requirements were driven by
game mechanics, and like thruster plates, subject to change without notice.

Interesting how many times (not just on this list) somebody adds their two
cents to an off-topic discussion, and then a paragraph later says, "Okay,
that\'s enough, we\'re done with that now!"

Hmmm...

Just an observation.  However, just because I feel like being on topic right
now I present a new item I had uploaded onto the list a few months ago.  It
has since been prettied up a bit and the description is a little more
coherent.  But, before I go on, would anyone be interested in a web-site
devoted to Traveller devices/items/tools that steer away from the "Boom and
Vroom" technologies.  No weapons, some small personal vehicles if appropriate.
Sort of like a Sears Catalog or a "whole realms" catalog like the one TSR
produced for the Forgotten Realms.

Microfoil:

Starship crews, surface teams, military and mercenary units, and those in the
civilian sector all have a need to join metals at one time or another.  Tanks
of fuel and oxygen require a good deal of volume and can be quite heavy.

Microfoil is the solution to this problem.  Microfoil is made up of a number
of extremely thin layers consisting of boron, carbon, silica or aluminum
combined with a transition metal.  The different components are selected
carefully to ensure a self-propagating, high temperature exothermic reaction
when exposed to a small amount of heat (such as the spark from a battery, or a
match or lighter, for example).  The temperature is high enough to melt a
filler to make a weld.  The thinner the layer, the less time the reaction
takes, and the less time oxygen has to mix with the metals, so the joints are
stronger then those welded with more traditional welding equipment.  The
layers of foil are generally between 20 atoms and 2,000 nanometers across.

The technology is introduced at TL9, but it is prohibitively expensive due to
the exacting specifications the foils must be made to.  At TL10, the
production process is refined, but still rather expensive.  By TL12, microfoil
can be made cheaply and easily.

Microfoil welding kits will vary in mass and price, due mostly to the
availability of the filler metals and the strength of the joints required.
Most members of a starship engineering crew, as well as combat engineers and
many mechanics will have thick pen-sized electrical "sparkers" to perform on
the spot welds when required.  The foils themselves mass very little (the
average packet weighs about as much as a small notepad, and contains several
hundred applications).

TL9     Cr2,000 per application.  (About 25-50% more for starship hull grade)
TL10    Cr500 per application.  (About 10-25% more for starship hull grade)
TL11    Cr25 per application.  (No extra change for starship hull grade)

Although probably incorrect, I\'d thought that Foundation was a huge influence
on Traveller.  So much of the Foundation series made it into Traveller that I
believed that the Foundation series is to Traveller as the Lord of the Rings
was to D&D.

Of course, seeing as the Foundation series was one of the earliest major "hard
sci-fi" works, it may be that alot of the ideas filtered down through other
sci-fi to eventually end up in Traveller.

	There\'s no animosity on my part to end, frankly, not even for
your ... determined ... defender (although the flames were flying
high). I\'m glad to hear there\'s none on yours, as I never
intended to make an enemy.

	Incidentally, the CIAC provided the following URL as a
reference: http://www.fcc.gov/isp.html. Quoting: 

The NOI seeks comment on whether the FCC should, in addition to
access charge reform, consider actions relating to the
implications of information service and Internet access provider
usage of the public switched network. In particular, in light of
concerns raised over congestion on the public switched network,
the Commission seeks comment on how it can most effectively
create incentives for the deployment of services and facilities
to allow more efficient transport of data traffic to and from end
users.
The Commission made no specific proposals, but tentatively
concluded that providers of information services (including
Internet
service providers) should not be subject to the interstate access
charges that local telephone companies currently assess on
long-distance carriers.

	And honestly, every time I see the original message again (about
once a year or so), I have to check AGAIN to see if it\'s still a
hoax. Like many, I firmly believe in the propensity of American
business to lean towards legislative solutions to problems
competing. I wouldn\'t trust the phone companies (especially
Useless West) as far as I can throw them. But given the
bureaucratic nature of the FCC, anything without a docket or case
number is immediately eliminated as most likely being a hoax.
Plus, I\'m sure my ISP and yours would immediately provide you
with as much information as necessary if it were really serious.
Then I\'d be concerned.

Yep.  The good ol\' days.  I guess its a trade off.  I can communicate with
Traveller people all over the world in a timely fashion, but talking to local
folk is quite a bit harder...

The internet tears down borders, but that\'s not always a good thing.

OK, how about...
tobbacco-nicotine
cannabis-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
opium poppy-morphine
                        codine
peyote-mescaline ==> lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
coca-cocaine
belladonna and other night shades

IIRC, in one of the sources, the Aslan were supposed to be descendants of
Terran cats.  They were captured by the ancients and  transported elsewhere.
After genetic manipulation, the neo-cats were released to develop on their
own.

I got much the same as you, but some differences.
First, I take 25 systems to mean roughly 25.
Second, I didn\'t count barren systems against the 25 (although I count them as
part of the empire, as refuelling depots, and such)

(Both of these are arguably non-canon).

Third, because the home world is TL8 compared to Sylea just reaching TL12 at
Year 0,
I required all the systems to be on a Jump-1 main from 1938-Keshi, due to low
jump tech levels.


This gives the following:
31 systems total (all within 5 parsecs of Keshi) (one at 2001 in Massilia, the
rest Core)
- -2 Santry (1736) and Cordova (1836)
- -2 systems spinward of Santry and Cordova
27 remain.
- -3 barren systems (1738, 2135, 2136) (up to you, but works for me)
24 remain.
Close enough for government work.

Santry/Cordova
Take these systems out of the equation, as well as the 2 systems spinward.
After all, the book didn\'t say *all* the systems within 5 parsecs.So heres
what I get:1437,

That drove me nuts until I noticed the second one.

Happen to know the page references to the Santry/Cordova deal?  I\'m probably
staring right at it, but I can\'t find it.
