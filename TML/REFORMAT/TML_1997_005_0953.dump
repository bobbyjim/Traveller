They were not only trying to escape in space, but also in time. The mission sponsor figured that even if 
the Villani discovered the existance of the mission, they\'d be far enough away in space and time that 
they wouldn\'t bother chasing them.

It doesn\'t say you can\'t, but it doesn\'t specifically say you can 
either. I\'m familiar with ArsMagica, cool system. At 90 000 tonnes I

Does the world generation system create an entire solar system like 
T2300, or does it key on the primary planet like CT?
I\'d like to see a system for the creation of alien races, a set of 
rules to develop their biology, and culture. Guildlines for the 
creation of alliances, and wars. In short the politcal makeup of the 
empires, and republics that make up a universe. Sure I can develop 
this myself, but It would be a ton of work making my own guidlines 
and I pay gamedesigners to make that job easier.

I\'m not saying that I don\'t like the traveller setting I think it\'s 
great, but I haven\'t liked recent developements. The Empress 
Wave, and the virus are not my cup of tea. It\'s like the creators 
painted themselves into a corner, and could only escape it by 
travelling back in time.

I\'m a great fan of Space Navy science fiction, I can\'t get enough of 
the stuff.  I\'d like to have an easy, and good system to simulate it.
I\'m curious as to whether the latest version of traveller is the 
system that I\'m looking for. I don\'t like the tech 12 limit it seems 
a step backward. I wouldn\'t mind playing in the eariler eras, but 
think the game mechanics should still handle higher tech levels.
Does the latest version handle clones, robots, androids,cybernetics, 
biological engineered organisms, or does it leave it all up to the GM.

Teraforming rules, and a writeup would be cool, to bring in another 
thread.

I live in a small city, our game stores aren\'t all that hot. Thanks 
for the leads though. I have an friend near detroit who can get me 
stuff, like a copy of FF&S hey, hey. Just ordered it. Sorry, he only works 
for friends.

After I get a copy of FF&S I\'ll try my hand at designing some ships, 
I loved travellers ship construction.

	A more effective approach is a nastygram to the originator, his/her
postmaster, and any other email addresses mentioned. First check for
"vanity domains" using whois, and address it to the REAL postmaster. Most
postmasters take these complaints seriously, in my experience. Here\'s the
my stock reply, as modified, that I fired off.

Dear submoronic cretin (not you, Postmaster),

	This mail was unsolicited, unwanted, uninteresting, and I consider it
harassment. You\'re using my bandwidth, my mailbox, my paid online time, my
download time, my hard disk and my personal time to screen an unwelcome,
worthless piece of junk. Remove my name at once from your mailing lists,
and do not ever bother me again. There are many places on the Internet to
advertise your services, but my mailbox isn\'t one of them. If I wanted a
service I\'d go where ads are appropriate and search for it. I will never
utilize a service nor a product from a company which uses spam to solicit
business.

Dear Postmaster,

	Can you please help stop this growing cancer across the Internet?
Unsolicited commercial mail is going to be the ruin of another potentially
useful technology if it isn\'t solved by the users. Further more, this pile
of cow dung was posted to a dedicated mailing list, where it is ABSOLUTELY
unappropriate. This crap is really getting out of hand, and I ask your help
in stomping out the jackasses such as the original author of the bilge
below. Thank you.

 Pittsburgh, Scranton, New York, Buda-Pesht (Budapest), Dresden,

	*SIGH* The original intent was that CONTRAGRAVITY=ANTIGRAVITY and
THRUSTERS (_not_ antigravity) were two different things, but

		CONTRAGRAVITY in T4 was NOT supposed to be the same as CG in TNE. It
_was_ intended to provide both thrust and lift.

	The difference between CG and Thrusters lay in their cost, mass, and
performance outside a gravity field.

	Huh? Who wrote you can\'t play in the service? I\'ve always interpreted
"mustering out" or "failing" survival roll as the end of character
generation. Doesn\'t mean the character actually left, that\'s just where the
game starts. When I needed a navy crew, I generated them until they were at
the appropriate rank and experience for their position, and then started
playing. So if you want to play a Naval Commander, generate the character,
and go for it!

These were either enemy warships or enemy merchantmen which were sold by
the Navy, with a certain share of the proceeds going to the captain and
crew of the capturing ship.

This was a good system for encouraging captains to energetically pursue
enemy shipping without blowing everything out of the water, and it was a
good source of warships, since most of those captured would be repaired and
put back to sea under the capturing flag.

This would seem to be a natural addition to Traveller:  PCs with Scoutships
or other mercenary craft could seek and be given letters of Marque, and
those in active duty would be encouraged to fight more strenuously for
promotion and their increased share of prizes.  Then too there could easily
be other parallels: just as the French had better-built ships (but not as
well-sailed early on), maybe the Solomani build great ships in the 1000-ton
range, so that any sector Admiral would do anything she could to get ahold
of one.

	The main reason General Aviation has been in such a slump is due to an
interaction between an unpleasant subspecies of lawyer and the typical
American desire to blame others for one\'s own problem. Cessna got out of
the GA aircraft market because, until recently, it was possible for an
idiot to buy a 20-year old poorly maintained plane, not bother to maintain
it, crash it, and sue the original manufacturer for megabucks.

Regarding my total skepticism of all oriental martial arts:
I have yet to see a training studio that does not have at least twenty trophies in its front 
window (and it has usually been open for 2 months. This indicates to me that it is largely 
malarkey.

Regarding effectiveness of martial artists:
the actual fighting skill is secondary to the discipline. Unless it is from a studio with 40+ 
trophies after being open for a month, a person highly ranked is probably in VERY good 
condition. I am currently not. Right now, a determined 12 year old would probably mop the 
floor with my face.

Regarding the effectiveness of real martial arts:
I believe you have forgotten several of the basic rules
1) bigger IS stronger
2) do not fight unarmed against armed and
3) ninja-schminja, ya can\'t karate chop a bullet

I believe in the art of ching-chunk (sound of SMG being cocked)

I have question, not just for Dr. Clark, but for others. Why does every like the modular cutters for
this ship? Is it becuase the happy fun ball uses them? Or is the the modular multi-mission aspect?

I personally don\'t like the cutter in this situation - because I want to get all of the troops and gear
on the ground quick and safe. While the cutters can transport some 60 people (and gear, if
you play with the numbers), it does so in two ships. Thus, two shots - and all your troops are
gone. Plus, all your troops have to be deployed in one location, or your ships have got to 
hopscotch around the LZ.

I prefer (and this is just my opinion - my preference is more expensive) a larger group of
smaller landing craft - in my case, one landing craft for each squad, capable of carrying
the squad and its APC. By giving each squad their own ship, I increase survivability plus allow
simultaneous deployment to distant areas.

Just curious about peoples opinions about this...or am I taking this way too seriously? :)

As far as I know, there aren\'t any "Antigravity thrusters" in T4.  I\'ll
assume you are referring to Contra-Gravity Lifters ("CG Lifters") and 
thrust plates ("T-Plates"), both of which operate on gravitic principles. 
The rest of my answer is based on that assumption.

Your conception of the two types of drive doesn\'t match my conception of
CG Lifters or T-Plates.  This is not, in itself, a problem; but I think
I\'d beter explain how I concieve of T-plates and CG Lifters.  Hopefully then
things will make more sense.


Contragravity lifters produce "lift" (counteracting the weight of a ship or
vehicle) by interacting with the local gravity field.  CG Lifters have a
surface area requirement, and (by extension) some type of "lift panel" or
"gravitic module" on the outer surface of the hull.  By providing additional
CG Lifters (and configuring them appropriately), it is possible to more than
cancel the weight of the ship or vehicle.  This extra lift can be vectored
(perhaps by moving the panels, or perhaps electronically using differential
thrust on a number of small panels) to provide propulsion.

Because CG Lifters provide lift and propulsion by direct interaction with a
world\'s gravity field, the actual performance of a CG Lifter equipped craft
will change depending on the world\'s gravity.  The rated performance will
only be achieved in a 1.00G field.  Performance is proportionally higher in
a high gravity field, or lower in a low gravity field.  In addition, there
is a critical gravitational field strength below which the CG Lifters are
unable to function.  Thrust drops beginning approximately 1 planetary
diameter from the surface of a world, and falls to nearly nothing
beyond 10 diameters.

Because the craft\'s aparrent weight also varies in proportion to the local
gravity, the CG Lifters are always able to cancel a craft\'s weight.  The
additional thrust (and therefore the vehicle\'s performance) will vary with
the local gravity - a CG Lifter propelled air/raft that has 1.5G
accelleration on Earth will only have 0.75G acelleration on a world with a
gravity of 0.5G, but would be capable of 3G on a 2G world.

Because of the distance limit for CG Lifters (within 10 diameters of a
world, and ideally within one diameter), and because performance varies from
world to world, CG Lifters are totally unsuitable as the main drive for a
spaceship (but are extremely useful for take-offs, landings, and skimming
runs).  CG Lifters have more utility as a lift and drive mechanism for
gravitic vehicles.

A bit of history: while QSDS and SSDS were being designed, Dave Golden
specifically wanted to avoid a situation where gravitic vehicles had to have
a separate thrust agency (such as HEPlaR).  Thrust-plates are unsuitable for
many vehicles due to the large minimum size requirement (and for other good
reasons, we couldn\'t eliminate the minimum size of T-plates).  Therefore, the
concept of contragravity lifters was extended to include the ability to
produce thrust as well as lift.


Thrust Plates are a type of maneuver drive, and provide a ship with thrust.
Like all of the other types of maneuver drives, this thrust is a force which
acts on the drive, and is transmitted to the ship via the drive mountings.

Like the other maneuver drives, T-plates produce thrust along a single
vector.  The drive must be moved (gimballed) to alter the thrust\'s vector.
Alternately, multiple drive units may be installed; by varying the power to
each unit, a limited amount of thrust vectoring may be produced (this is
vectoring by differential thrust).

Unlike the other maneuver drives, T-plates are often termed "reactionless",
because they do not consume fuel and don\'t eject reaction mass from the
ship.  The drive operates on gravitic principles, but the thrust produced is
independent of the strength of the local gravity field.  Thrust plates do
require a nearby large mass (such as a star or planet) in order to work
effectively ("nearby" in this case is in astronomical terms - approximately
1000 solar diameters)

This is still true.

This is not true.  If the grav vehicle was built with additional lift (or
thrust) over and above its weight, the contragravity system can provide
thrust.  The CG-derived thrust will vary with the local gravity field.  Some
grav vehicles will want other methods of propulsion.

This is no longer quite true, since (at least in my conception) the field is
mostly contained within or very close to the grav module(s).

Most ships will have a T-plate drive of 1G (or more, up to 6G or so)
capacity.  Such ships would have to use contragravity systems to hover over
worlds with higher gravities.

Airframe vehicles without CG Lifters can take off vertically if the thrust
plates are arranged such to allow this.  In cases where no CG Lifters are
installed and  the thrust plates are arranged for forward flight, the
vehicle will require a takeoff roll to achieve flying velocity (at which
point it can be kept aloft by wing lift).

Most VTOL (Vertical Take-Off/Landing) vehicles at TL-9+ would probably
include CG Lifters, and could perform as you describe (slow-speed vertical
take-off, followed by high-speed cruise on HEPlaR or T-Plate thrust).

Yes.  CG Lifter vehicles would take a long time to reach high orbit, and
would be practically useless for interplanetary travel.

This sound like Thrusters provide both lift and thrust.

This sound like Thruster provide only thrust.  
So I have a few questions.
1) Do Thruster produce only thrust or lift and thrust?
2) Does Contra-Grav provide lift and thrust, or like any other maneuver drive
only thrust?
3) Assuming Thruster produce only thrust will it really be so hard in the far
future to make gimbal mounted Thrusters that instead you install Contra-Grav?

Since my ship was capable of making planetfall and it had Grav APCs I didn\'t
see the need for cutters.  Most arguments as to why cutters are better than
the ship can be used for why the APCs are better than cutters and most
arguments for why cutters are better than APCs can be used for why the ship
is better than cutters.  The thing that cutters do allow is performing
multiple missions in space.  I not sure if this added flexibility is needed
in a Merc Cruiser or not.

question the usefulness of the distinction between "starports" and

available regardless of whether it\'s called a "starport" or "spaceport".
The classification system does not seem useful because installations which
are practically identical (C and F, D and G, E and Y) are given different
designations while ports which are significantly different (highports
present/absent, bases present/absent) are given the same designation. I
realize this was used in older material but I had hoped T4 would be able to
keep the best from previous rules and discard the rest.

Consider a system with a dozen shipbuilding ports, 3 orbital space
colonies, and space stations able to refuel and build ships in orbit around
the main world, the asteroid belt, and a gas giant. Consider another system
which only has one shipbuilding port and no space stations or highports.
The rules give both these systems an A classification, though they are
totally different. Consider another two systems which both have no
facilities whatsoever. Yet there are two different designations for these
systems.

Part of the problem, I feel, is the notion that every system will have
exactly one \'main\' port. What about systems with several inhabited planets,
or ones with competing governments or port corporations, or ones with
starports at several planets and by gas giants? Even if the rules don\'t
generate this automatically there should be some way to describe this.

The descriptions of the starport services and facilities is very good.
There should be some mention of the costs and resources concerned with
actually operating a starport.

Mike, I\'ve been promoting this idea for a long time.  You\'re going to hear
that it won\'t work in Traveller, because the weapon systems in the game
will turn a defeated ship into a cloud or vapor...or a hunk of useless
junk...not worth capturing or refitting.  

I obviously don\'t agree.  ;-> I want Letter\'s of Marque, boarding actions,
and Prize Ships in my games!

I think the trick is to arrange things so that ship systems can be "knocked
out" without being destroyed.  If you can temporarily silence a ship\'s guns
and maneuver drive, you can call on your victim to surrender...or board,
and take her if she refuses.

Like I said, the trick is arranging things so you can *temporarily* knock
out a ship\'s systems.  This has been something I\'ve been working toward for
sometime.  One thing I\'m playing with is putting pieces of all the weapon
systems, maneuver and jump drives *outside* the ship\'s armor where they can
be taken out by smaller weapons at long range.  I\'m postulating that these
outside pieces are easily and cheaply replaced...once the fighting is over,
but hard to
repair/replace during combat.  The expensive parts stay behind thick,
multiple armored hulls that the long range weapons don\'t often penetrate.

Ship battles become a contest of blowing off highly redundent
surface features with the occasional critical hit penetrating into the
interior and causing great damage.  Damage control crews rush to repair or
replace damaged surface units and bring weapons and drive units back online
while gunnery crews continue to blast away at each other with remaining
weaponry.  If the damage control crews can\'t keep up, their ship will
become toothless and unmaneuverable, and her Captain will have the
unenviable choice of surrendering, facing a boarding action, or being
destroyed as the attacker closes into the range of his more powerful (but
*very* short range) weapons.

I\'m still scratching my head on what to do about sandblaster surface
attacks from massed fighters.  They can\'t penetrate a hull or destroy a
ship, but with their numbers can blast the surface features off knocking
weapons and drives offline temporarily.  Of course, that might not be so
bad.  Big ships would still have to close to knock the enemy out, and given
*time* the weapons and drives could be brought back online...still thinking
about this one.

Anyway here are the conditions I think we have to met in order to make
"taking prizes" work:

1.  Weapon and Drive components can be easily damaged at long range,
    but given time can be easily and cheaply repaired.  Ships carry
    multiple replacement parts and given time a Prize Crew can get a
    ship moving.
    
2.  Ships normally duel at long ranges with weapons that don\'t
    usually penetrate hull armor, but do damage surface components.
    Occasionally, these weapons *do* penetrate doing critical damage.
    
3.  Ships also pack ship killer weapons that can punch through a
    ship\'s armor, but these weapons have *extremely* short ranges.
    This means if you can\'t keep your opponent at a distance, you\'re
    choices are surrender or die.  It also means ship\'s *won\'t*
    close until they\'re reasonably sure they\'ve silenced the other
    sides shortrange weapons.
    
4.  The idea of surrendering is culturally acceptable.  Crews that
    surrender aren\'t summarily executed or routinely mistreated.
    Pardons and prisoner exchanges are accepted as normal under the
    rules of war.  Captains that have surrendered still have a
    career, a damaged one perhaps, but they *can* get another
    ship..maybe.
    
5.  Boarding is possible, and can succeed without completely
    wreaking a ship.

We can get 1 by going to two part systems (complex, expensive,
irreplaceable parts inside the armor and simple, cheap, easily replaceable
parts outside the armor) for weapons and drives.  We can get 4 from the
culture.  I think we have 5 if we have the other 4. It\'s 2 and 3 that are
the sticking point!

I think something needs to be done about the weapons. 

Lastly, this only really applies to ships of similar classes.  A 100td
scout gets *creamed* by a 1000td destroyer, that gets *creamed* by a
10,000td cruiser, that gets *creamed* by a 100,000td dreadnaught, that gets
*creamed* by a 500,000td superdreadnaught.

Now, do you have any thoughts on all this? ;->

Too true!  I was going to post something about this, but RL kept me too
busy this week.  The technology is probably here to produce inexpensive and
not too hard to fly "aircars" for general use, but who in their right mind
would manufacture them commercially?  The first time somebody crashed one
the manufacturer would be sued into the poor house.  Sued by the guy that
bought it, by the families of anyone injured by the crash, by anybody with
damaged property, and by anybody else that thought they could get something
out of it! 

I know it doesn\'t seem reasonable that someone could sue the
manufacturer for crashing their own airplace, but this is the
USA (Usual to Sue All)...unfortunately.  I guess the Imperium has more
reasonable product liability laws? ;->

Actually it does. T4, pg 22, "Mustering Out":

"If the player chose a target age at the beginning of the process, the
character may end the process at exactly this age. If this falls in the
middle of an educational or career term, he begins the adventure portion of
the game still attending that school or involved in that occupation."

But it\'s true, the focus of the rules is on characters who have left active
service. I think this is appropriate for the basic rules. Books that focus
in great detail on the military services are likely to follow at some
point.

Starships, plus my own errors. 

The correction (x14) to the life support values resulted in 4.4 MCr
increase in cost and a 5 Std reduction in cargo space. The armor value USP
is now correctly entered as 30 (80 numerical value). The one year fuel
supply for the power plants is now properly indicated (it was previously
included in the volume calculation). The USP for the Heavy Laser Battery
(two 251J TL12 turret mounted lasers) is now properly calculated. I also
entered the two 60 Std dismountable tanks for the jump fuel in the USP.

I think I\'ve made the corrections properly. Any further corrections,
suggestions, and/or comments would be most welcome. I did quickly look at
increasing the maneuver capability to 3 G\'s. This could be done, but, with
the additional volume needed for the drive, power plant, and fuel, the
cargo space would be reduced to a very minimal value. Some of that space
could be regained by sacrificing some of the ruggedness of the ship by
reducing the armor and changing from low to standard automation (i.e.,
reducing the crew).

Any such research would be a darn sight more than "arguably unethical"

I believe that there have been recorded cases of mating between
humans and orangoutangs (Simia satyrus). I seem to recall that the
resulting offspring are infertile and severely mentally retarded
(in so far as such a term could be applied to such a hybrid), but
given that orangoutangs are further from us than chimps, it does
give one pause to think. I believe there is currently a move on to
reclassify chimps and bonobos <sp> (which are even closer to humans
than chimps) part of genus Homo.

One point which all this has missed, given that the population of
Homo sapien and Homo erectus 300,000 years ago was probably on the
order of one to two million, just what was the impact of the ancients
genetic sampling (assuming at least 2000 individuals for each sample,
some 40+ human races, thats a fairly significant slice of the
population at the time). Or did the ancients just sample once and then
develop all the other human races from that single sample? In which
case the other human races are a lot closer genetically than it would
appear. This of course assumes the ancients actually physically took
individuals for their genetic samples, not something strictly
neccessary; they could hav just taken genetic material.

I agree totally which is why i went for 4 Maverick APC\'s that could get 2

4 locations at the same time with (in my design) 20 troops and 2 crew of
the APC\'s, what i would like to have done was include another 2 Grav
fighters so that each APC has air support. As for the Argument that Cutters
can get from jump point to surface quicker, since my Mavericks were totally
space worthy and 6G capable with Thrusters, they could do exactly the same
job with the Ship turning up at 3G (3J 4M in original spec for the Cobra,

this is only partially true, it all depends on the surface of which the
grenade is lying when it explodes, if a grenade is lying on or in a very
soft surface such as a Rice paddy field the effective damage range will
only be a few feet out from ground Zero as most of the blast just goes
upwards, on soft ground such as turf, it would be a few meters with most of
the blast still going upwards, on a hard surface such as concrete it could
be as much as 150 meters because the blast can go in all directions, this
is all due to wierd and wonderfull science that i didn\'t have explained to
me when i was a squadie, i was just told if a grenade lands next to you in
very soft or soft ground, dive a way from it and hit the deck the likely
hood of you being hit is minimal, if on the other hand you are in an urban
situation and the grenade lands on the road get behind a wall quick or you

No point. If they are close enough to critical to have a noticeable

One thing to check is the distribution of stars. For example, while
Alpha Centauri may be the closest star to Sol, the reverse is *not*
true. 

So it\'s possible that colonization headed off in the direction with
more J-1 routes, and only spread in other directions much later.

Short for "fabricator". Basicly a black box into which you feed specs
(say a set of CAD/CAM "drawings") and which outputs the finished item. 

A true "faber" requires molecular level fabrication technology. That
is, the ability to say "I want a molecule of *this*, there, and a
moecule of *that* over *here*..."

We come close with some semiconductor production technology, but we
can\'t yet combined the "fine control" with the ability to deal with
"large" (inches to feet) items.

Closest we have at the moment are some items that can produce 3-d
models of parts out of plastics.

So? Do like an old Christopher Anvil story. Have the "low tech" natives
have a "religious" caste of "mystics". When the players try to
exterminate them, the "mystics" (actually high powered psis) mop the
place up with them.

In the story I refer to, the Terrans were trying to get a treaty signed
so they can "protect" the planet against some nasty aliens who are
planning to conquer the place. 

When the dust clears, we have aliens cowering in the ruins of ships
that\'ve been hit by tornadoes, tidal waves, earthquakes, etc, etc. And
the "Elders" of the native "mystics" are wandering around making
comments to the younger "mystics"" "So this is the \'self-control\'
you\'ve been bragging about. Look at this mess! ...."

Because of speed of light lag. Assuming that sensors have the
resolution, you can "stabilize" the image. But that won\'t tell you a
damn thing about where the target will be several seconds later. And
*that* is what you need to be able to hit it. Because the image you are
viewing is where the ship *was* several seconds ago, and it will be
that many seconds *later* when your laser beam goes thru the point
you\'ve aimed it at. 

The problem is that while you may be able to "exactly" hit the point
you are aiming at, that has nothing to do with aiming at an evading
target at multiple light second ranges. There, the trick is trying to
*guess* where the target will be when your beam arrives. If it is
moving at a steady velo0city, or even a constant acceleration (both
amount *and* direction), the solution is easily calculated. 

But if the velocity/acceleration are varying *unpredictably*, then you
can\'t determine *where* the target will be when your shot arrives. At
best, you can determine the *likelihood* of it being in various
positions relative to the most recent one you know about.

This is an effect that doesn\'t occur at ranges encountered on Earth. So
it\'s not something people are used to.

It\'s "Hohmann" orbit.

And you have to balance the "breakup" a bit. Make the chunks too small
and you get a bunch of ionized hydrogen and oxygen in the upper
atmosphere. And most of the hydrogen will *leave*.

Make them a bit bigger and you put a lot of heat into the atmosphere,
which could interfere in the terraforming process. And you increase the
amount of water and gasses lost.

The best solution is to crash *big* chunks into the ground. You don\'t
*want* significant amounts evaporating on the way down.

The tricky part is making the approach path one that minimizes the
impact velocity. For that, you want to have the iceberg approach the
"trailing" side of the planet. And do so in a path that\'d "just miss"
if the planet\'s gravity didn\'t pull it down. 

One way of getting the "low,thin" atmosphere type is to use controlled
bombardment to create a chain of deep, overlapping craters. This gives
a valley made up of interlocking circular segments. I\'ve seen a
proposal for terraforming a "one-face" world (ie one that has the same
side always towards the star, due to tidal locking) this way. The chain
of craters extends completely around the world at the terminator
(day/night line), and has a river flowing from the poles to the
equator. 

The "valley" is miles wide, and a mile or so deep. That makes it
habitable, even if the rest of the planet isn\'t.

Nice urban legend but it don\'t wash. Salutes of various forms go back as far
as one wishes to look into history, long before visored helmets were used.
It is also VERY poly-cultural, a good example would be Japan where small
flags were worn by each combatant which identified them and their clans. The
Romans used the raised stiff arm as well as the chest-thump as salutes which
obviously has nothing to do with visors since they didn\'t use them.

Salutes of various forms are an expression of the \'pack-animal\' aspects of
human psychology not an expression of mechanics.

	OK. When we were creating SSDS in one mad sleepless week last year, the
consensus was to ditch the "Spherical 90% Weight Cancellation Field" stuff
from TNE, and go back to the MT conception of CG/AG/whatever you want to
call it: the whozits creates a field which interacts with the local gravity
field, producing a force. There\'s no difference between "lift" and
"thrust"--thrust is a force in the direction you want to move, lift is a
force opposing the gravity vector.

	Thrusters, instead of interacting with the "local gravity field"
interacted with the "gravitational substructure of the universe," or some
such malarkey. It was just handwaving to allow CG/AG/Whatever to drop off
sharply with distance from a planet, and hence make it unuseable for
spacecraft. Thrusters function into the outer reaches of a solar system,
while CG/AG/WE only works near planets.

	The reason many ships carry both CG and thrusters is cost/power/idunno.

I think that QSDS & SSDS are ok but I cant bring myself to putting much
effort into designing ships when there is so much limitation in both
systems.  The design sequence in MegaTraveller was even better!  

I have read that you \'can\' use FFS to some degree but there is no
definitive answer.

Of all the material that has been produced for T4, ship generation has been
on the back burner as far as I can see.  

If I am way off base here Please let me know.  I\'m not trying to rain on
anyone\'s parade, I just would like to see something worthwhile done.

The rest of T4, so far, I can live with basically.  As soon as something
other than Mileu 0 is promoted.  Ive played for over 10 years at TL14-15
and it is hard to limit yourself to TL12.

Soapbox mode off.

Comments? Questions? I will be looking forward to reading them, both
positive and negative.

Well, there aren\'t competitions in aikido (not strictly true - one school
has competitions).  Our club has been going for 15 years without tropies).
I can see why some MAs have sparring and competitions (it helps hone your
reflexes, and probably control your adrenaline, if someone else is *really*
trying to hurt you), but it can also lead to a MA being turned into a
sport, rather than a practical defense.

>

I disagree with this.  Whilst fitness and body condition can help you, the
most important things are spirit (I don\'t mean mystic mumbo-jumbo here),
balance, basic technique (fancy moves don\'t tend to work in real situations
- - simple ones do) and perception.  "Well, you could say the same thing
about a boxer." I hear you cry.  That\'s exactly right.  They are both
martial arts.  Just because oriental MAs have a sprinkling of
religion/philosophy, and have cool films made about them doesn\'t make them
unbeatable,... or worthless.

Yep.  I found it much more difficult to put wrist-locks on a rower, or to
move someone *big*, but as my technique improved I found it easier, and I
wasn\'t getting much stronger.

Absolutely.  Don\'t bring a cutlass to a plasma-fight, or something like that.

When questioned by a class as to what was the best technique, a high grade
aikidoka turned and ran to the other side of the room.  If you don\'t need
to fight (as in defending someone else), then the best defense is to not be
there.

	1. My site has moved to www.pcisys.net/~goldendj/Traveller. Much of it
hasn\'t been edited and uploaded yet, but I\'m working on it.

	2. The NAH stuff hasn\'t been moved, and I don\'t know what the status of
NAH/FF&S2 is. I\'m still trying to find out from IG what involvement I\'m
going to have. While I\'m still interested, I\'m getting more and more down
on T4/IG. I may wind up just starting a project to fix FF&S for TNE, and
stick with that.

>I have read that you \'can\' use FFS to some degree but there is no
>definitive answer.

	Both QSDS and SSDS are based on FF&S, that it, all the parts were designed
with FF&S. The only differences are:

		1. Fusion plants below TL12 have their minimum size multiplied by 12
		2. Thruster plates cost 25% of what they did in FF&S.
		3. Jump fuel is now 10%xJn
		4. CG provides lift and thrust instead of just "cancelling" part of the
weight of the ship. Divide the numbers in FF&S for CG for one ton
displacement by 15, and that\'s how much is needed to provide 1 tonne thrust.

Well, he\'s using his off hand to fire one, dealing with recoil from two
different sources, and firing pistols one-handed.  I\'d add one level of
difficulty to his good hand pistol, and two to his off-hand pistol.. first
Spectacular Failure he gets, give him a jammed gun, he\'ll have to

Take a close look.. usually those trophies belong to the sensei.. who\'s been

I should introduce you to Johannes, the Swedish Ninja from Hell.  He is a
nice guy, who regularly throws people over walls for fun.

The aforementioned Swede stands about 5\'4".  I am 6\', and a former soldier.
He could drop me in a heartbeat.  He has.

Well, DUH.  The trick is to catch your opponent unarmed.  Or do you alwayas
carry a firearm?  Every minute of the day?  Remember, most forms of martial
arts were developed by societies that were forbidden the use of weapons.
Many forms include very useful disarm moves.

>3) ninja-schminja, ya can\'t karate chop a bullet

Why would a ninja use karate?  Taijutsu is their preferred art.. anyway, try
shooting someone who doesn\'t attack until they are within two feet of you,
with your weapon slung or holstered.  That\'s how you win against an armed
man.. surprise.

>I believe in the art of ching-chunk (sound of SMG being cocked)

You have 30 rounds.  I can wait and hide.

Thanks Glenn I believe I was mislead. A friend of mine said that T4 
didn\'t have any rules for in service play. I don\'t own a copy of T4 but 
i\'m thinking of buying one. I have owned CT, and do own T2300. I\'m 
trying to check T4 out before investing cash into a system I\'m not 
happy with.

	Well, although this may seem surprising, no.  It might help channel
things a little, but that\'s it.  If I\'d given them nothing but a cargo of
refrigerators, pianos, safes, and anvils they probably would have just

in all fairness to Glenn I\'ve got to say that he was the only one who
didn\'t show any genocidal tendencies).  I can just see them doing this in
fact; they\'d have turned it into a competition, and anyone who developed a
lead would have been slung out the cargo bay doors by the rest of the crew,
and so forth...

How about the players gets to roll two shots, but each shot is made at one
task difficulty higher (average to difficult...) I imagine you could do
the same thing by firing one gun more often, but this way looks cooler. 

Also, I\'d only let the PC fire twice at the same target.  If the player
wants to shot at two targets at once (one gun at each) I\'d have each shot
at *two* task levels higher (average to formidable).  I\'d only let this
trick be performed by a PC using two guns at once. 

Other ideas?

I think the original poster was referring to the *specific* type of

eyebrow)

Obviously, salutes of different types are used the world over. The roman 
salute (palm outward) I\'m sure began as a way of showing one\'s hands 
don\'t conceal a dagger...

It is best of course, to face the person doing the saluting...

So Basically your saying a Thruster is like CG it just interacts with the
"gravitational substructure of the universe" instead of the "local gravity
field".  This is pretty much what I had thought, however what is confusing me
is why is that a Thruster only produces thrust in one direction while CG can
produce thrust in many directions?  I mean If they are pretty much the same
thing with the exception of what they interact with shouldn\'t they act the
same?  I realize this is all based on a bunch of handwaving but I would like
the handwaving to be consistent.

You know, the visor origin is *probably* more right than wrong. OTOH, some
of it might go back to tipping/removing your hat/helment. The salute isn\'t
exactly to the eyebrow after all, it\'s above it..up toward the hairline
where a cap bill would be located.  Then again, how about the old practice
of peasents showing their respect by tugging their forelock.  Now explain
the logic of *that* one!  ;->

Yeah, and then they bring the arm back to their chest symbolicly stabbing
themselves, huh?  ;->

On a Traveller note, would the salute survive into the 43rd century? I\'d
bet yes, Militaries being what they are.  It might not be the hand to the
forehead we\'re use to.  With visored Battlesuits and Vacsuits being so
common, maybe it\'s back to an open palm or something.  

OTOH, I wouldn\'t expect Scouts to salute much of anything! ;->

Chris, this is why I ran screaming away from Gravitic Thrusters.  My hands
just wouldn\'t wave that fast.  ;->

I changed the fundamental physics behind Thrusters from gravity to jump.  I
use stutterjump for in-system travel.  Ok, my hands have to wave just as
fast, but in a different direction. ;-p

My stutterjump is limited to a pseudo-velocity that is a small fraction of
c.  The stutterjump works by instantaneously jumping you a few centimeters
forward several hundred thousands of times a second.  Because you aren\'t
injecting "jump fuel" with each stutterjump a jump bubble isn\'t created and
you aren\'t isolated for a week.  OTOH, without the jump bubble you can\'t
jump further than a few centimeters per jump.  There is no actual
acceleration or velocity change, just positional change, so you don\'t have
to worry about turning into jelly from the several thousand g pseudo
accelerations either.

Movement is along the axis of the ship\'s backbone from the forward coils
that generates the jump to aft ring that completes the circuit. In order to
change direction of movement you have to slew the entire ship.  Spheres
allow the fastest slew rate, but because of the geometry of the jump (the
curve coming off the coil is too wide for the aft ring to grab) are *very*
inefficient.  Potential ship pseudo-speed increases with the length to
width ratio up to about 10 to 1, and then rapidly falls off because the
field induced by the coil is too far forward of the ring, and begins to
break down. Tradeoffs between agility (slew rate) and pseudo-speed keep
length to width ratios in the 3 - 6 to 1 range.  

Then when you want to go interstellar, you inject your jump fuel into
hyperspace though your forward jump coils, a jump bubble surrounds your
ship closing behind the aft ring, you lock your sensors onto a gravity
source several light years away, you fire a grav pulse to reel in your
ship, and you jump several parsecs instantaneously. The jump bubble keeps
you isolated from the rest of the universe for the time it takes to
dissipate..approximately one week.  So, even though the jump was
instantaneous you can\'t get out of the bubble and back into normal space
for the week.

Gravitic drives are used to land, lift and match orbits.  Your stutterjump
maneuver drives can\'t do that.  They *are*
omni-directional, but only work by pushing or pulling on a nearby gravity
source.  This is why ships have both..in my game.  ;-> Oh, tractor and
repulsor beams fall into this category somehow too, but I\'m still
cognitating on that one.

Inertial compensators and internal gravity control are a third technology. 
They *should* be related to the physics behind Grav drives somehow, but I
don\'t have them rationalized too well yet. Any ideas you want to
contribute?

Um, I have to take exception to this.  Anyone playing with any of my 
characters on IRC or PBeM can vouch that I do not play military 
characters.  My characters are fully developed and playable.  One is 
an entertainer/agent, she is mustered out and has joined a diplomatic 
team. One is a scholar specializing in xenobiology, she booked 
passage on a ship and is now lost and making The Long Way Home. One   
is a diplomat (MT), she is *not mustered out* and is investigating an 
assassination, having been present when it happened. One is a Noble 
*and is still active* as mustering out of the Nobles made no sense to 
me, especially since she has been assigned to her current duty 
(Imperial Liaison to the ISBA) by dear old Uncle Cleon (see the ISBA 
mailing list for the further adventures of the Duchess Rose).

There is no reason any of these careers have to be "mustered out".  
An entertainer could be on tour and using whatever ship is in use 
during the game to tour.  Depending on the level of achievement of 
the entertainer, that tour could be pre-arranged, or take the 
entertainer wherever the ship is headed. What happens after the 
entertainer joins the ship, well, thats another story entirely.

The same method can be set to other character types:  An agent on 
route to an assignment; a scholar booking passage (on a non-military 
ship) or brought in as a civilian expert ( on a military ship with 
proper security clearance, of course); a Noble dealing with family 
business matters of whatever form, etc.

There are no limits to the game, beyond those that we impose.

    'body' => 'I recall someone complaining a while ago about rolling 2- for misjump given
in the T4 rules. I never paid much attention to any discussion about this
since I assumed the rule was a misprint; all existing rules made a misjump
possible only with negative DMs and the rules in T4 are phrased confusingly
since positive DMs are bad and it doesn\'t explain what "using unrefined
fuel when not equipped to do so" means. However, someone from IG recently
told me that, yes, this is correct and it does mean that even a perfectly
maintained and operated ship has a 1/36 chance of misjumping. Unless I
misunderstand something, this is bad.

Since practically no ships carry enough fuel for a second jump, since the
probability of misjumping to within maneuver drive range of a fuel source
is nil, and since most ships don\'t have the power or supplies for
interstellar travel with maneuver drives, ships that misjump are
effectively lost. As a player, rules which kill an entire party with one
dice roll with no possibility of influencing or recovering from the roll
are unacceptable. From TML postings, it seems most referees creatively
interpret the roll to spare the players. As a referee, rules which demand
that the laws of physics work differently for players than for NPCs are
unacceptable. Even if we do assume the players are somehow immune, the
stated misjump rules make the Imperium, or any multi-sector-spanning
interstellar government, impossible. Not 7-dice-impossible; really
impossible.

From the rules, a starship has a 35/36 probability of surviving each jump,
and commercial ships make two jumps per month. This means a commercial ship
has a (35/36)^2, or about 95% probability of surviving each month. This
works out to about 50% per year, or less than 7% for a four-year term. This
applies to both starships and crew; almost nothing that uses jump drive
will last a single term.

It gets worse. If we assume each jump averages 2 parsecs, a ship can go
about 25 jumps, or 50 parsecs, before its chance of survival is less than
50%. The same applies if it ever wants to go back. If you launch a fleet of
1000 ships to the spinward marches (around 200 parsecs, as I recall),
assuming no mishaps, perfect maintenance, straight-line travel with no
short jumps or zig-zags, only about 50 would make it there. Maybe 2 would
make it back. This is assuming absolutely perfect conditions; with
realistic conditions likely no ships would make it.

The consequences are pretty staggering: No interstellar commerce; any cargo
that would make enough profit to pay for the constant loss in ships would
bankrupt the shipping firm the first time the cargo itself is lost. No
interstellar tourists, except for suicidal multi-millionaires and I don\'t
think you could build an entire industry on them. No Zhodani core
expedition. No scout service; the ships would never come back. No
megacorporations or Imperial navy for the same reason. No retired starships
or crews, unless they retire after a few months in service. No ships more
than a few years old. No vast fleets roaming space, no battles over
sector-wide borders. No Xboats. No Imperium.

Obviously this will not do. My ruling is to add one more DM for misjump: -1
if the ship has the required number of engineers (remember negative misjump
DMs are good). This makes jump drives merely dangerous instead of suicidal,
and gives the crew something to do while the ship is in jump. Any comments
are welcome, especially if I am missing something in the misjump rules. I
can hardly believe this has gone unnoticed.

And if you had each man go to the surface with a grav belt it would be safer still.
I think the case could be argued for cutters based on military necessity. It is cheaper to 
maintain two cutters than 60+ grav belts

Very true. the idea of diving to "mother earth" for protection is good because the elastic 
nature of soil absorbs shock and fragments well. However, hard surfaces (infantry in WW2

Very well then. I will rephrase it. The MODERN version of the salute come from the raising

The military are currently developing something very similar, for fitting in

Well, in that case I\'m not even going to bother arguing about it. I\'ve
always thought that that was the definition. What is the proper word then?
In any case, my argument still stands, even if the terms I used are
technically incorrect: If Solomani can interbreed with Darrinas, Vilani, 
etc. then they would be able to breed with Homo antiquitus, should any of
them turn up.

Well, it makes me wonder what term that apply to groups that are distinguished
by failing that test. And what the definition of species is. The other
definition always made a lot of sense to me. Ah well... scientists... ;-(

But in that case isn\'t my great-grandmother of a different species than me?
In fact, aren\'t most people in the world of different species (And, yes, I\'m
being facecious, but I really don\'t see the sense in that distinction).

Whereas now it seems to me that we need some sort of super-species 
designation. What\'s the difference? (Waitaminute, is that the "Homo"
part of the species name? (What is it it is called? Genus?)

Careful with your terms; the Vilani _explored_ as far out as the Spinward 
Marches (as evidenced by the First Empire colony on Banegen (Vanejen to
non-Vilani ;-) and possibly much further. They just didn\'t _settle_ more
than halfway into Corridor. And you\'re right, that is very strange (Almost
as strange as getting to within a few parsecs of Terra around 1000 AD and
then not finding it despite settling most of the neighboring Dingir subsector 
_after_ that.)

Anyway, it certainly wasn\'t because the Vargr stopped them. In Year Zero
the Vargr of Corridor are unable to prevent an extremely rapid expansion
into Deneb, indicating (at least to me) that any Vargr worlds in Corridor
at the time are weak and propably low-tech.

One possible solution is that the Vilani used native human races for labor
a lot more than their history mentions and that there were an abundance of 
those to rimward and trailing but very few to Spinward (If that is the case 
then Deneb is propably a First Empire outpost and not a native human race).

fooling around with some System Defense Boat designs.  I took as a
starting point the Classic Traveller SDB from Supplement 7 - Traders and
Gunboats.  Based on a 400T hull, the CT SDB has 6G performance, mounts two
triple laser turrets and two triple missile turrets, and carries a crew of
10.  There is extra cargo space for missiles.  The ship uses TL12
technology.  Cost is about 775MCr.

  I fooled around with some lower tech designs using QSDS 1.5 and
Wildstars Big List of Hulls.  At TL9 it looks like a 400T SDB designed
with this system would carry only missiles, since no lasers are available,
and the smallest QSDS PA-Gun (CT N-PAWS) weighs in at 200T.  SSDS would
probably do a better job.  I\'d probably go with a mix of two types of
ships.  One type would have a larger hull, maybe 600T, with a PA-Gun,
a couple of missile batterys, and some sandcasters.  The second type would
be smaller, 200 or 300T, with missiles and sandcasters only.

  At TL10 QSDS gives you a laser bay weapon, though aside from power
consumption it\'s pretty much inferior to the TL-9 PA-Gun, especially in
terms of range. Again, missiles are still the best bet.  I put together a
nice 400T 6G SDB at TL10 with 2 laser bays, two missile turrets, two
sandcasters, and small military sensors, plus a big cargo bay for extra
missiles, all for about 610MCr.  Adding the medium military sensors would
run about 200MCr more.

  At TL11, the QSDS system gives you a nicer PA-Gun - half the tonnage
(100T), cheaper, and slightly less crew.  Looks good, so a SDB would
likely mount one of these, plus some laser turrets (finally available at
TL-11) and missile turrets.

  So that\'s the threat - consider it!

The misjump rules are an example of a dumb rule.  I ignore it in my 
campaigns, unless there are negative modifiers.  There are several 
rules like this in T4, that make the game as written illogically and 
unplayable.  I ignore or modify for playability sake.

Well, what do you want for the campaign?  I\'m using a battleship, since I
want to experiment with troupe play.  I played an MT game where we were the
entire crew of a 400-ton Missle Boat.  This is one of those things where the
Referee simply has to make a decision!  If the T4 rules included rules for
every possible situation and campaign style, they\'d be the size of the
Oxford dictionary.

Greg Porter has already done this work in the latest edition of Guns! Guns!

numbers, and are generally more useful.

At the risk of being soundly hissed, I\'m picturing the parade Imperial
military salute as something akin to the facist salute.  Right arm held
straight, raised slightly, about 45 degrees to the right.  For more
"informal" occasions (passing a lieutenant on the street, for example) a
Roman-like hand to the chest.

Raised fist, palm facing the scout, middle finger extended.  ;)

  As already pointed out, useful grav vehicles start at

You\'ll have civilian aviation that\'s relatively

  From the game Imperium;  remove the fourth ring (N.Z., and the
tips of Africa and S.A.), remove the laurels, add eight five pointed
stars around the bottom half, and put a slightly larger eight pointed
star at the top (Terra and the rest of the system).  Add as many star

Actually, the US Army is fielding this data link system -- they\'re out here at
the National Training Center doing the Advanced Warfighting Experiment with a
brigade-sized force equipped with interlinked data systems.  They\'re not only
putting this equipment on the AFVs, though.  The poor foot soldier is getting a
pile of electronics to carry around -- a heads-up data display, a camera mounted
on the helmet (a la Aliens), and some other commo gear.  As if they don\'t have

in a system, and may not automatically choose that green, lush, garden

1. The Imperial colonists arriving at the system are Belters. Although 
there is a perfectly good agricultural world in the system, they choose 
to make the asteroid belt their home. Farms etc are of course established 
on the planet, but the starport and major population centres remain in 
the Belt. 
2. The planet is interdicted because it has a developing race. Rather 
than abandon the system entirely, the Imperium chooses to set up a base 
on the airless moon of the planet for observation. Over time, the base 
becomes strategically important, and the starport expands to Type A. 
3. Continuing unrest on a world leads to the destruction of the planet\'s 
downport. The starport authority leases a heavy lifter ship to move the 
highport out of orbit and elsewhere in the system for safety. They choose 
to establish operations around the local gas giant, and support 
refuelling operations. 
4. A star is discovered that lies on a strategic chokepoint (ie, difficult 
or uneconomical to bypass it; unfortunately, the star has no planets at 
all. The Imperium subsidises a corporation to build a starport orbiting 
the star, to sell imported fuel at enormously inflated prices. The starport 
effectively becomes the system \'mainworld\'. 

Summary: Slavish devotion to concepts of \'mainworld\' and \'starport\' has 
the potential to eliminate a number of very interesting SF possibilities.

Sure.  It would take a lot of effort to do with standard Grav
Thrusters, because they don\'t work out that far.  If/when you get out
there, though, you just start the chuck moving and a few years later do a
course correction in the outer system, and so on.

But, you don\'t have to go all the way out to the Oort for icebergs. They
should be all over outer systems, in the rings of outer planets and as icy
asteriod belts.  In the Sol system there\'s the Kupier Belt <sp> out
between...Uranus and Neptune (??)...that should be composed of nice big icy
chunks, and it\'s a *lot* closer than the Oort Cloud.

Suz, is absolutely correct.  You can do just about anything you want.  Find
out what kind of characters your players want to play and customize your
adventures accordingly.  

Many years ago, while I was taking an anthropology course in
college, I was in an interesting game.  The GM and I got to talking one
afternoon and developed an "academic interest Traveller game". I played an
anthropologist employed by an NPC corporation to study the cultures of
various planets.  The rest of the players were crewmen on an
Merchant-Explorer:  one studied the economy and markets (guess what she was
studying <g>), one was a military
specialist (ROTC), and the other two were strictly spacemen.  All of us
could (or had to learn how to) pilot, astrogate, engineer, gun, etc as we
went.  We were assigned the mission of finding potential markets in an
unexplored subsector for the corporation.
Unfortunately, the GM graduated and got a job elsewhere and the game died
out long before my interest in it did.  Hum, I might take a shot at
recycling it one of these days.

In a game I ran last year, I started with a couple of people that wanted to
do puzzle solving type things...so at first it featured an
technological-archaeologist and a scientist.  The archaeologist was
involved in a dig at the ruin of an old base, there she found a data
crystal that she couldn\'t decode.  This brought the scientist into play,
building a data reader to play and decode the data on the crystal.

At this point 3 more players joined, but they wanted more combat oriented
stuff, so I put them in the local space Navy as the officers of a small
frigate, in the doghouse for some infraction and banished to the frontier. 
I integrated them into the game by having the scientist need help from the
local Navy commander to get some resources he needed.

When the data was finally decoded it pointed to a treasure store located on
a planet in the Briawl system (2 subsectors away), so the Naval commander
detached a small frigate (guess which one <g>) to transport and assist the
scientist and archaeologist.  Needless to say the journey involved several
adventures involving all concerned, culminating in the investigation on
Briawl in the middle of a local civil war.

I intended to have the results point the adventurers to another system and
another and...well you get the idea.  <g> However, the game died there when
3 of the players were transferred.  [That\'s what I get for playing with
active-duty Navy guys. <g>]

As an aside, I\'ve been known to recycle everything.  <g> Foex, Briawl is
being featured in a PBEM I\'m running right now, as a primitive Vrgar world
fighting occupation by the bad guys (the Zeristu Empire) and the
destination of a group of PC\'s seeking to salvage a 600ton cargo ship
hidden in a lake.  The PC\'s are good guys (the CSA), and mortal enemies of
the Zeristu so I imagine they\'ll eventually be getting involved with the
Vrgar freedom fighters.  In addition, one PC is an Agent type so she\'s on a
secret mission to make a delivery to someone on Briawl, and "just along for
the ride" as far as the salvage mission is concerned...yeah right! She
actually doesn\'t know what her mission really is, and won\'t until all the
pieces come together and *IT* happens, then I\'ll have fun seeing if she and
her "ride" survive.  <G>

I\'ve never had an entertainer in one of my games, but Suz is proving that
it\'s an interesting choice.  As for Nobel careers...well, I\'m reminded of
Lord Byron, Lord Kelvin, Lord Nelson, and the Duke of Wellington, sure they
are nobels, but their careers weren\'t *just* being nobels..until somebody
convinces me different I think nobel PC\'s also need some other career to
make them more interesting.

I can see that.  I know it has bad RW connotations, but 4300 years from now
it would be plenty of time to rehibilitate it. ;->  It sure would look and
sound *regal*, especially if you included the stomp and heel clicks from
heavy boots.

question about sensors.  Under QSDS, there are major cost differences
between the "Small Military" and "Medium Military" sensor packages prior

in MCr.


TL	Cost	Performance	Cost	Performance	% Cost Premium

12	63	A10 P4 J10	93	A16 P5 J16	147%


  In fact, the above underestimates cost differences, since the Medium
package needs more power and more crew (though power is not as much of an
issue at TL9, since you are buying it in such big chunks).

  My question for those who play space combat regularly (my campaigns
center on trade and individual combat) is about the value of buying the
better sensors, especially for small warships like SDBs.  At TL10 in
particular, the additional sensor cost is considerable for a small warship
like an SDB - as much as one-third more (600 vs 800 MCr for a design
identical in every way otherwise).  

  Would, for example, three warships at TL10 with the better sensors be as
good as, or better than, four identical ships with the shorter-range
sensors?  Would it make any difference if the ships were SDBs, which spend
much of their time running silent and using passive sensors?

  Thanks much - I look forward to your comments.

Given traveller tech, it is close enough.  With the time scale terraforming
projects are likely to be working on (centuries) it\'s not like you really
care if it takes a couple or 5 years for the iceball to make it to the
target.

My old astronomy text has a rough diagram of the Milky Way galaxy. It\'s
hard to give exact numbers because stellar regions don\'t form borders like
countries, but the solar system (and the entire Imperium) is on the order
of 1000 parsecs from where the Orion Arm thins out. The gap between the
Orion and Sagittarius Arms, on a line from Sol to the galactic core, is
roughly 900 parsecs wide. The galactic core is about 7000 parsecs away,
getting there would require crossing over 1000 parsecs of rifts.

The rifts in Traveller\'s stellar maps are so tiny as to be invisible on all
but the most detailed galactic maps. I don\'t think most Traveller players
appreciate the size of the galaxy. The Milky Way is roughly 30000 parsecs
across, and is over 20000 times the size of the Imperium at it\'s peak.

By the "game" you mean the t4 rulebook or the actual board game imperium?

There could be different salutes for different uniforms.  After all, in today\'s army a

The "h" is silent in the French haut.  Also, it\'s "haute cuisine"; cuisine is a feminine 
noun, so the modifying adjective has to agree in gender, which means add an e and 
pronounce it like "oat", but not with our English dipthongization of the vowel.  

I pronouce "hault" "o", and "haut" "howt", and "von" "fon".  "Haut" is intentionally 
wrong -- it\'s meant to show the blending of European pronounciations over thousands of 
years.

Sensei was talking to the class about practical stuff, and someone asked, "what would 
you do if six men with knives attacked?"  Sensei said, "I\'d run away."  A few people 
laughed.  Sensei said, "I\'m serious.  Don\'t be stupid.  Run away."  It\'s a true story, 
but in my friend\'s class, not mine.  My sensei would have agreed.

The Imperium probably doesn\'t have any product liability laws, but individual worlds do. 
Ling Standard Products probably doesn\'t sell air/rafts on certain worlds for that 
reason.  Products liability law is really a political decision made in the light of 
historical experience.  In the USA, for a variety of reasons, we allocate compensation 
to persons injured by defective products on a strict liability basis, enforced by 
private civil actions in the courts.  There at least a zillion other ways to handle the 
problem that have been, are being, or will be tried.  For example, we could say that the 
injured person has no recourse.  We could have an insurance fund to which all 
manufacturers contribute, and which would pay claims through a simple, abbreviated 
process (unlike common law litigation).  Someone else will have to come up with some 
adventure hooks for exploiting this problem.  (Smuggling a product to a planet where the 
manufacturer refuses to sell it?)

Y\'know, if the ship building rules were more accurate, you\'d get
*exactly this effect!

Why? Because the ships would need large radiators! Knock them out and
the ship *has* to cut power usage to match the reduced radiator area or
fry.

Even if we assume "magic" technology that allows using smaller (and
hotter) radiators at higher tech levels, all that does is reduce the
chance of damaging them with a given shot. If you *do* damage one of
the "more efficient" radiators, then the ship has to cut power use
*more* than if you\'d taken out an equal amount of "less efficient"
radiators. 

If we were to go this way, we\'d need to have an "efficiency" rating for
all ship components that use power or produce it. A 90% efficient power
plant would produce 1 MJ of heat for every 9 MJ of power it produced.
Likewise, a 90% efficient system would produce 9 MJ of "useful" output
and 1 MJ of heat for every 10 MJ of power it used. The more efficient
the system the higher the tech level required. And at a given tech
level, lower efficiency systems are cheaper to buy. 

And we\'d need radiators of various efficiencies/operating temps. The
radiators would be rated in MJ/m^2 (ie each square meter of surface
devoted to them radiates so many MJ of energy). There\'d also have to be
a table giving the effective temp of such radiators (based again on
MJ/m^2). This would affect detection.

You\'d be required to have enough radiator area to get rid of the waste
heat from all the systems you "normally" run. And it\'d be a good idea
to have enough for all the systems you *might* run at the same time.

If you don\'t have enough radiator area, then the excess heat is
radiated from the rest of the surface area, and the ship is assumed to
reach the required temp by the end of the turn (in other words, the
whole ship has to get a *lot* hotter). If the temp is above 400k, the
crew will die. If it\'s above 500k, the crew will die and various
systems fail. If it\'s above 1000k, the ship is ruined. 

So the general result of loss of radiator area would be to try pumping
more heat out the remaining radiators (until you hit their limit). And
trying to repair the damaged radiators. If you cn\'t get rid of all the
heat, and *don\'t* want to use the "the ship gets hotter" rule, then you
have to turn things off. 

I think that\'d be *very* realistic. The captain has to choose between
sensors, weapons, life support, and drive. And he may discover that his
choices are reduced to run like hell or surrender. And one more hit
could reduce them to surrender.

BTW, for similar reasons, jumpspace *cannot* be "bright swirling
colors". The "background temp" has to be *lower* than the ship\'s temp,
or the ship will get hotter by absorbing radiation (light) from the
surroundings.

I\'ve done this before, though I was approaching it from the viewpoint
of max velocity from a "mass driver" of various lengths.

         D=.5AT^2
        2D=AT^2
      2D/A=T^2
sqrt(2D/A)=T

V=AT, so

	 V=A*sqrt(2D/A)
         V=sqrt(2DA^2/A)
         V=sqrt(2DA)

> 3) finally, base muzzle energy and required energy based on that figure.

Isn\'t muzzle energy merely E=.5MV^2 ??

For your "pistol" we have D=15 cm (.15 m), V=5000 m/s.

    5000 = sqrt(2*.15*A)
    5000 = sqrt(.3*A)
    25e6 = .3*A
    83.333e6 = A

So you need 83 1/3 million m/s^2 of acceleration, or about 8.5 million
Gs. 

7.06 gram (btw, that is a very *light* dart. About 1/4 ounce!) at
5000 m/s gives 88.25e3 joules of kinetic energy at the muzzle.

As a crosscheck, let\'s use E=F*D instead of E=.5*M*V^2.

  F= 7.06 gm times 83.33e6 m/s^2 or 588.33e3 Newtons
  D= .15 m

Again we get 88.25e3 J. Which is the equivalent of about 21 grams of TNT.

Now comes the "ouch" part. It takes the round all of 60 *microseconds*
to travel the length of that barrel. So the 88.25 kJ have to be
delivered in that short a period. Which means your weapon is using 1.5
*gigawatts* during that time!

So the real trick is finding a way to deliver enough power fast enough.

They settled much less than half of Corridor.  In Vilani & Vargr (pg 11)
the map labeled The First Imperium at its height  (circa -3500) indictes
that  the First Empire did not  even include all of subsector D but went
only as far as hexes 2701, 2801, 2804, 2806 and all of hex rows 29,
30,31 and 32. (They also settled subsectors O & P) At the spinward edge
of the First Empire Uughrae (2806) is Jump 2 from the start of a 45
system Jump 1 main (at Nuplae 2606) which covers most of subsectors B
and C.  The rest of the coreward half of Corridor (Amshagi to the
Vilani) is all accessable by Jump 2 except for 1 world.  Therefore it
should be obvious that it was not the limitations of Jump 1 and 2 ships
that prevented Vilani settlement beyond a very small part of corridor
but political/social limitations.

Vilani settlements in Corridor, Provence, Windhorn, Meeshan, Mendan, and
Amduken sectors were dominated by the Vilani bureau Makhidkarun which
dominated a total equal to about 2.5 full sectors.  The Vilani bureau
Naasirka also dominated an area equal to about 2.5 full sectors.  The
Vilani bureau Sharurshid on the other hand dominated an area equal to
about _6_  full sectors.

The Imperial Encyclopedia says (pg 46) "Each of the three bureaux was
effectively identical, but they initally espoused different
philosophies, which were based on their origins....Sharurshid,
originating with the merchant class, emphasized interstellar trade.
Makhidkarun, originating with the aristocracy, emphasized interstellat
government.  Naasirka, originating with the shugiliis, floundered after
it found that it could not control food supplies on most of the worlds
it dealt with, but it ultimately became a broad-line organization which
emphasized energy, transport, and luxury goods."

I believe that these sentances and the map of which bureaux controlled
which sector (Vilani & Vargr pg 11) contain _ALL_ the evidence we need
to understand why the Vilani Empire expanded the way it did.  

The First Empire expanded primarily to rimward because that was the
direction of space controlled by Sharurshid, the only bureaux which
emphasized interstellar trade.  The Ziru Sirka did not expand very much
to spinward or coreward because those directions were controlled by
Makhidkarun which was comparitively uninterested in expansion.  Remember
to think like a Vilani. Why would we want to explore new planets when
we\'re doing fine with the planets we have ?  Trading in subsector D of
Amshagi was good enough for my grandfather and it\'s good enough for me.

Of course the "real" reason the Vilani did not expand to spinward and
coreward was so to explain why the Spinward Marches had a vibrant
Solomani descended culture.

There aren\'t enough minor human races for this to matter, usually only a
few per sector.

We know (Droyne Alien module) that Droyne and Chirper populations are
densest in the Spinward Marches and are less common as you move out from
that central point.  We also know that Grandfather checked up on his
Droyne descendants between circa -100,000 and the present time and that
he helped them to survive. The Imperium (circa 1113) contained about 40
minor human races (Grand Census pg 28).  The Spinward Marches contain
only 1 minor human race, the Darrians.  There also do not seem to be
many minor human races in Deneb or Corridor. Given the size of the
Imperium we should expect 2 or 3 minor human races per sector, perhaps
Grandfather exterminated some of them to protect his descendants. 
Remember that we know that Humans were left on about 100 worlds but on
some they "died out".  Now many of these extinctions would have occured
at or shortly after -300,000 as human populations were unable to survive
without the technology of their ancient masters but some may have been
"ethnic cleansing" on the part of Yaskosdray.

Now Dave, don\'t you think you should stop beating around the bush and

All this subtle innuendo is really not as effective.

	In the RW of the time Captians, especially of the Royal Navy, fought to
remain in the Frigates because that\'s where the Prize Money was to be made.
And given a choice tended to avoid engaging enemy warships if there were
merchantmen to be had for the taking.  Point in fact one of the missions of the
American Frigates durring the War of 1812 was to engage enemy Frigates so as to
allow the Privateers to sieze merchant shipping with easy.
	BTW eventually the real money was to be made in Privateering, civilian
merchant adventurers with Letters of Marque, who had the right to sieze enemy
vessels on the high seas.  The Americans made Privateering into a truly
frightening weapon of economic warfare in the Revolutionary War, the
undeclaired war of the XYZ Affair and the War of 1812.  Loosing hundreds of
Privateers against their enemies and almost sweeping the seas clear of
commerce.

	The problem is one of Technology.  Durring the Age of Fighting Sail the
technology of shipbuilding was functionally identical for the various
combatants.  Therefore any vessel built by any of the combatants could be
seemlessly used by any of the others.  In Traveller, and any industrial (or
better) technological power this is no longer the case.  FoEx imagine the
difficulties of capturing a couple of old Soviet Destroyers (presuming you
could) and then maintaining them and rearming them.  Nightmare time!
	Navies design ships to fulfill the functions of their tactical doctrine
and different navies have different doctrines.  Cultures and priorities effect
the design and functions of warships too.  Not to mention the expectations of
what the Navy is going to have to fight during time of War.
	FoEx; the Royal Navy has a tremenous anti-submarine warfare capability,
this is a legacy of the Cold War when it was expected that they would need it
to hold off Soviet submarines.  The United States OTOH has a Navy designed for
power projection as we throw our weight around a lot STS on the International
stage.  It\'s not for nothing that Clinton (<GAG> at typing the name) admits
that in a crisis the first thing he asks is where is the nearest Carrier.
	Now the US and Royal Navies have been cooperative Naval partners for
almost a century now and our ships are "relatively" similar.  They are not
similar enough however that you could toss a British crew onto an American
ship, or visa versa, and expect them to function properly without a LOT of
fumbling around and mistakes being made.  Sure the Detroyers of both powers are
driven by gasoline fired turbines, but one uses metric measurements and the
other uses pounds and inches!  And that\'s just one example of thousands!
	Perhaps durring a Civil War Prizes and Prize taking might come into
vogue, essentially because the ships and doctrine on both sides is identical.
But I doubt it.

   The original point of this thread was the very silly concept of an
unarmed person attacking a ABD equiped foe.
   While unarmed combat has it\'s place in Traveller (such as on worlds with 
very high law levels), attacking folks in Battle Dress, Augmented is not
one of them.  Even if a bunch of tried to swarm just one Imperial Marine in
BDA, he would just have to touch off that chest mounted claymore... :-)

That explains a lot, I was always hearing certain players refer to
(usually female) NPCs as "Ho\'s" (as in "Oh that Arianne, she\'s such a ho",
they must mean "hault" and be referring to her noble characteristics.

Well the star trek rpg had ship assignments as part of it\'s character 
generation process. This was one aspect of the system I liked. 
Unfortunately I got rid of ST THE RPG, so I can\'t remember the ship 
assignments. I\'m a fan of systems that provide as much assistance for 
the GM as possible. Anything that can give me ideas, or make my job 
easier is welcome.

An other problem with the method stated I have to pick who\'s going 
to be the captain, helmsman, etc. I think it would be neat to have 
the dice determine this by chance.

No problems, I\'m just getting a feel for T4, to see if they\'ve 
corrected a couple of problems I\'ve had with the Traveller series.

A book I picked up at "buck-a-book" (translation for non-locals; place old
books that don\'t sell go to die, or at least be sold at serious
discounts") called "the Aquatic Ape" had a neat but kind of wacky theory
about human development. This theory said that humans had developed from
simians who had been marine mammals for a brief time.  It had a lot of
good arguments, but pretty much ignored the major arguments against.  

The picture they painted was of floating colonies of humanoids living off
of aquatic life and moving on and off of land as food supplies and safety 
permitted.

Perhaps the stock the ancients took would be more at home in water?

T4 does allow for many non-military careers.  However, as I said before,
they still seem to be less well-defined than those from the military.  I
think this is legacy design, reaching all the way back into the mists of
GDW-time, and I hope IG can shake it off eventually.  As you say, there are
no limits other than those we impose, and yet by its design the game
enables military-style characters and adventures more than it does traders
or scholars, say.  

As a further indication of this legacy, just look at the process and
terminology used in character generation: as you said, why would it make
sense for a Noble (or Agent or Entertainer or Scholar or Merchant or...) to
"muster out"?  _That_ is something that should be peculiar to the military,
not something that should be a basic part of every character\'s creation.

And, as they found in Aliens -- and in the intelligence community in real
life (remember the Soviet carrier Kiev?) -- sometimes having too much info
is worse than not having enough.  Some method of effectively filtering

Depending on the gun anywhere from Space Combat ROF 10 to ROF 100.  That\'s
in shots per (30-minute) space combat turn.  For battlefield use, that
translates into one shot per 3 minutes (ROF 10) to one shot per 18 seconds
(ROF 100).  The higher ROF is more common.

Dave and I have a difference of opinion on this matter.  ;-)

> 1) Do Thruster produce only thrust or lift and thrust?

If you\'re asking me, thrust only.  Making them provide both lift and thrust
was something that DGP added in their starship operators\' book, and it\'s 
something I don\'t agree with (for reasons that I outlined earlier).

Lift and Thrust.  Dave and I can both agree on that one, no problem.
Dave added the ability for CG to produce thrust (again, for reasons I
outlined earlier) for T4.

You could do that; the disadvantage is that it would involve a lot of heavy
machinery that has to move, and whatever it saved you (in the sense of not
having to install contra-grav), would be most than balanced out by the big,
heavy machinery that requires frequent maintainance to keep it working
properly.

You could also install multiple thrust-plate drives, only one of which was
powered at any one time.  Contra-grav is cheaper, though, and requires less
surface area on many ships.

Even so (no matter how you arranged to have the T-plates produce lift), you
still have the problem of lifting a 1G T-plate ship off of a 1.2G world, and
of providing enough lift to skim a gas giant against a gravity of 1+G.


IMHO, the cheapest, simplest solution is to install contra-grav in everything
that\'s intended for planetary landings or for fuel skimming.  I can, however,
imagine using the gimballed T-plates, or multiple T-plates to make High-Tech
equivalents to the Harrier and Yakolev "jump-jets" (special-purpose military
fighters; the Harrier uses gimballed nozzles, while the Yak has a special
vertically-oriented jet engine that\'s started up for vertical maneuvers).

Ship Combat
I have developed a basic/simple ship to ship combat system using a mix
of several rules. However, the best part is what I borrowed from the
miniatures game "Harpoon." Damage that builds over time and critical
hits that knock major systems out. You get more critical hits depending
on the amount of damage taken in one turn. (I use the "Harpoon"
calculations to figure out damage points for my Traveller ships). One
good hit on a small ship can drop everything off line for a few-many
rounds... away boarding parities!! I envision space combat to be very
fast=85 after a few rounds the general space around the combat zone is
filled with drifting ships attempting to repair systems, stop runaway
radiation damage and/or fires (yes, it is space, but the O2 has to come
from someplace) or getting the hell out.=20

In one battle, many years ago, the Imperium player was able to repair
(due to better training) several BBs that reentered the battle zone and
crushed the Sword World fleet. This means that crew quality and damage
control has a major roll in my combat. Part of Ship Tactics is setting
up the DC on board your ship. The PC that forgets this, or to drill
his/her crew will not last long. The SW fleet went for more weapons and
less crew due to lower technology.=20

Captured Ships=20
Someplace a old Challenge or Journal talks about fleet prizes. I do not
remember where I read it and do not have access to my files. If someone
can help and review the rules it may help this discussion. In my game
this the reason for joining the IN. Else all you have to look forward to
is being away from home for a VERY long time. One good capture and you
are set for life. Recruting for the IN is very easy now.

My reason for captured ships is that the hull (my rule) is practically
indestructible. The winning side will capture the ships and tow them
back to the yard to be refitted.  Several famous ships have fought in
wars on both sides =96 captured, refit, captured, etc=85 The 5 wars with =
the
Zhodani offers all type of possibilities. =20

Hope this helps.

Very true.  My Drill Sergeant at Ft. Benning could spend 15 minutes

redesigned our House Rules for Education.  Let me know what you think,
please (jpg@langley.mitre.org).

Note that these rules accomplish three things:
1) Sets a standard as to what the numerical values of EDU mean.
2) Reduces the amount of EDU awarded from Advanced Education.
3) Reduces the effect of EDU on tasks that are unrelated to a major.

- ----

Education in Marc Miller\'s Traveller
- ----

Education measures the amount of schooling that a character has.  Whether
that schooling is formal, thus awarding a degree, or is informal does not
matter.  Education is not a measure of an ability to think or reason (which
is Intelligence), nor is it a measure of domain knowledge (which are
skills).  It does, however, imply that one has learned how to learn.

Education is absolute (almost) and can be related to the following scale.

EDU  Equivalent Formal Training
- ----  ----
5    Junior High School
7    Senior High School
8    Associate/Technical
9    Undergraduate
B    Graduate
D    Doctorate
F    Post-doctorate


Education House Rules
- ----

1) Anyone pursuing an advanced education (which is defined as any education
beyond senior high school) must declare a major.

2) The player completely chooses which skills he receives during his
advanced education.  For an undergraduate degree, at least two skills must
be applied to the major.  For each graduate degree, at lease one skill must
be applied to the major.

3) EDU is increased once for every two years of schooling; three skills are
added for every two years of schooling.  Honors programs remain unchanged
At the completion of a formal degree, a character will always get *at
least* the minimum education value.  For example, all characters with an
undergraduate degree will have at least a 9 EDU.

4) Graduate work would have to be in a field that is in the same genre as
the undergrad degree (see Undergraduate/Graduate Genres and their Skills
below), or the character would have to re-attend college for a certain
number of years to meet all pre-requisites (See Mike\'s Continuum Idea below).

5) The EDU stat DM will be applied to skills depending on the genre (See
Determining EDU Stat Bonuses below).

6) One of the options for Grad School must be the Criminology cluster
(either replace Jack-of-all-Trades or a Science/Performance).


Undergraduate/Graduate Genres and their Skills
- ----

Technical - armory, astrogation, communications, computer, craftsman, 
  electronics, engineering, gravitics, mechanics, robotics, sensors. 
Physical Sciences - biology, chemistry, forensics, geology, medical, 
  physics.
Social Sciences - archeology, history, interrogation, investigation, law, 
  linguistics, philosophy, psionicology, psychology. 
Performance - art, acting, dance, music, writing.


Mike\'s Continuum Idea (MCI)
- ----

In order to determine how many years of pre-requisites a character needs in
order to switch genres between undergrad and grad school, consider the
following continuum which relates genres from "techie" to "artsy".

Technical <--> Physical Sciences <--> Social Sciences <--> Performance

Each "hop" through the continuum costs a character a year of pre-requisite
study (see house rule #4 above).  So, going from an Engineering
Undergraduate to a Music Graduate takes an extra 3 years of Undergraduate
work, but going from History to Archeology takes no extra years.


Determining EDU Stat Bonuses
- ----

If a character uses a skill that is in the same genre as his degree, then
all of his EDU is used to determine the task roll.

If a character uses a skill that is in an adjacent genre as his degree is
in, then one-half his EDU is used to determine the task roll.

If a character uses a skill that is two genres away from the one his degree
is in, then one-fourth his EDU is used to determine the task roll.

If a character uses a skill that in more than two genres away from the one
his degree is in, then none of his EDU is used to determine the task roll.

/What the referee giveth, the referee can taketh away/.  

If you want to leave out the psionics do so, but this Christopher Anvil
story can be molded into something more appealing.  Your defenseless TL-0\'s
are governed by a protector race with big ships and bigger guns, they get
miffed rather easily if someone else muscles in on the slavery act.  

Whilst approaching a planet getting ready to waste millions of TL-0\'s the
players run into this protector race who blasts them out of the sky.  The
players ship is crippled and crashes on the planet.  The players drift in
and out of conciousness, to weak and beat up to remove themselves from the
wreckage and salvage their powerful weapons they so casually used in the
past.  Just as they fade into unconciousness they see some curious TL-0
aliens peer through the gash in the side of the ship and move menacingly
towards the players.

The players wake to find themselves held captive by the TL-0\'s,
tribal/ceremonial preperations are underway for a big feast, the aliens are
of course Vilani throwbacks, they\'ve grown tired of eating each other and
would like the taste of fresh meat ;-).  There you have it, the shoe is on
the other foot, the players are without their beloved weapons and must
escape through miles of hostile wilderness to an encampment of the protector
race to steal a ship (you could let them recover some weapons from their
shipwreck - like a body pistol or a dagger :-).

If the players act like genocidal headcases let the rest of the galaxy treat
them as such, they\'ll soon start to run out of life (and just think of all
the fun you\'ll have!).

like to hear from anyone interested, particularly from David Golden and
Derek Wildstar who\'ve both been very helpful to me in the past.  Most of
my traveller experience is with CT - our group is converting to T4.

1. Sandcasters - The combat system in T4 is a little fuzzy on the use of
sandcasters.  It says they may be used against missles as well lasers,
but it does not say just how sand affects a missle - I mean it\'s just sand! 
SSDS mentiones a beam reduction value, but no info on what this means,
and it is not mentioned in QSDS.  The sandcasters have a capacity (i.e.
30 at TL12), but how much sand may be launched from one caster in
one turn?  Do you group them into batterys and assign a MFD?  Does the
sand go away after each turn?  If it\'s a high tech sand caster with a
control module to gravitically control a "shield" of sand, can the
sandcaster gunner control them like missles after they\'re launched?

2. Missles - why is the number of missles a MFD can control an issue? 
Can\'t you have missles that aquire a target and then follow it on their
own?

3. Computer Program "Select" - this program was useful in CT for taking
out drives or weapon systems.  Why was this omitted in T4?  How do
you still shoot out specific systems, and does armor then apply?

4. If a weapon hit is scorred in combat, T4 indicates that the battery is
destroyed.  Wouldn\'t this result is a bunch of batterys with just a few
turrets each being much bettter than a few batterys with many turrets? 
Perhaps it is better to have each such hit destroy one turret or one turret
per point of damage scorred.

5. The recent "Numeric Armor vs. Armor USP Rating" discussions on the
TML have me wondering if we\'ve been using the right numbers in our
games.  If, say, 80 points of armor results in an armor USP of 30, which
number is used in combat?  For the ship presented in T4 and Starships,
the listed armor is which number?

6. Mass of Starships - Why is volume used to determine thrust rather
than mass?  This means that any 400 dt ship requires the same drive to
achieve 4G of thrust, regardless of the armor or systems on the ship.

	Why not simply put the T-plates on the bottom?  Have it operate
like a helicopter while in a gravity well.  A low, flat configuration like
a disc or slab, and a 2G+ M-drive (or two/three independent 1G T-plate
drives with multiple small power plants for redundancy) would probably work
really well with this...  and it would take a lot of strain off the IC/AG
system.  You could do away entirely with the contragrav, and save credits,
volume, power, maintenance time and costs, and so forth.  And, ship\'s down
would be aligned with local down, and you wouldn\'t have nasty long
corridors that would suddenly turn into vertical shafts if the inertial
comps failed.

    If memory serves, Homo Cro-magnon (sp?) our forebearers litterally appear
out of nowhere in the geological record and take control of the planet STS in
the blink of an eye even in anthropological terms.  But more on this later.
    This and other things have lead me to speculate that when Grandfather &
Children showed up they winnowed down the native proto-human stock here on
Earth and conducted their alterations here, on Earth.  Therefore the Humans
that were left behind were doubtless the ones that didn\'t make the "cut" to be
taken with Grandfather & Children when they left.
    Now that kind of takes the wind out of the Solomani sails now doesn\'t it!

    OC it\'s entirely possible that Humans were retransplanted on Earth.  I
believe Cro-magnon (sp?) pops up in the geological record about 50,000 years
ago?  What if some robotic collector simply sampled, or moved, some of the
dwindling survivors of failed colonies of Humans back to Earth back then.
Remember, Grandfather\'s been in and out of that little pocket universe of his
couple of times in the past 50,000 years. ;)

    Ever take the time to look at the NAME on the trophey of who won it?  Often
those trophies were won by the founder of the studio.  Even in older studios
with WALLS of trophies if you look closely you\'ll see that majority of them
have been won by a handful of students.  Does this mean that the rest of the

    Trophies are a marketing tool, a short hand that shows the founder of the
Studio knows what he or she is doing without having to beat up every potential
student that comes in through the front door.

    Another thing here, you seem to thing the ability to Kick Ass is the sole
reason to study the Martial Arts.  In reality it\'s only one of MANY reasons,
most having to do with avoiding fighting in the first place. ;) As any

Your astronomy text is definitely getting old. The \'rifts\' between the
galactic spiral arms turn out not to be rifts at all. Yes, the gas and dust
lanes are concentrated in the spiral arms, hence the star formation regions
are concentrated in the arms, hence there are a lot of young stars there -
huge associations of O and B type stars are mostly what delineate the
spiral arms of other galaxies we can see. 

But the inter-arm \'rifts\' are full of stars like our own. As I understand
it, these zones are not much less dense than our local region, in terms of
older Population I stars. So in theory you could jump from star to star
across the inter-arm zones just as easily as across the Orion arm.

But your point about the incredible scale of the Galaxy is worth noting.
Given canonical Traveller jump drives, it would be a very long time indeed
before any obsessive explorer managed to get beyond the Orion Arm.

For really incredible, up-to-date maps of the Galaxy, check out the Local
Interstellar Medium website [skip this if you\'ve heard me rave about it
before]. I don\'t have the URL handy, but if you search for "Local
Interstellar Medium" you will find it. There\'s also a link to it from the
3-D Starmap site (also a must-see):
<http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html>

The maps on the LISM site were scanned from a very good book, _The Guide to
the Galaxy_ by Nigel Henbest and Heather Couper (Cambridge, 1994). It\'s
packed with gorgeous color astrophotography, but it has the best, most
detailed maps of various regions of the galaxy I\'ve ever seen. An
entertaining, in-depth description of the galaxy\'s structure as it is
currently understood. Highly recommended.

Here\'s some of the galactic data I cribbed from _The Guide to the Galaxy_:

Galactic Disc: ~100,000 light years across. In cross-section, can be
divided into three nested regions:
   Thick Disc: Intermediate-age stars between Pop\'n I & II: ~4000 ly thick.
   Main Disc: contains most of the stars. ~2000 ly thick.
   Thin Disc: central plane, ~500 ly thick, contains Sol & most of the gas
& dust.

Sun is ~6.1 kiloparsecs (20,000 ly) from Galactic centre.
   Suns\'s orbit about Galactic centre: ~240 million years.
   Sun\'s \'apogalacticon\' (farthest point): 107% of current distance.
   Sun\'s \'perigalacticon\' (nearest point): 99.5% of current distance; the
Sun will reach this point in ~15 million years.

Sun is now ~50 ly (15.34 pc) above Galactic midplane.
   Maximum height: 250 ly above, in ~14 million years.
   Maximum depth: 250 ly below.
   Crosses midplane every 33 million years.

It\'s a shame the Sun isn\'t at its maximum height now, because that would
put us above the densest dust lanes and give us a grandstand view of
things. As it is, we have a hard time seeing the forest for the trees, as
it were.

Thank you! Not bad for one big gun. But is one meson gun enough ground
support for a Merc Cruiser? As an old grunt 18 seconds b/w shots is a
very long time. If you have multiple targets, and are attempting to
figure out the fire control solutions, etc ...  the time is even longer.
In 18 sec the entire battlefield can change.=20

While the meson gun is a great STS weapon, and can move some mud if you
have numbers (i.e. the IN), I still like dead fall ordnance for local
support. I seem to remember a SF story about a ship in low orbit
dropping some type of steel bars (specially designed for that) over the
target. What type of effect would that have? And would be the time on
target?=20

In arty with a 155 we had flight times up to 50-60 sec, and that could
be dangerous depending on how fast the battle was moving. Of course once
we were on target we could pump out a sustained 3 rpm per gun with 8
guns for a round every 2.5 sec. With a max. rate of fire for about 6-10
rounds per min, depending on the gun crew and how many safety procedures
you followed. Each one of these rounds could, depending on the type,
burst open above the target and drop about 88 HEAP grenades. This gives
you about 2000 - 20,000 explosions on target per min. We found out that
this would stop about anything on the field, including tanks.=20

Now I figure that your average merc is going to be outnumbered, and will
have to rely on superior tactics, C3I, and technology.  Most of your
mercs will not want, nor be able to, fight a local military of equal or
greater technology. This means many targets =85 do not think of it is
being outnumbered, think of it as having a large target selection=85 and
many of these targets will be soft.  A meson gun would be great if I
wanted to remove some bunkers, or dug in positions. But if I have two
companies looking at some militia division that intel forgot to mention
moving into my supply area, I want/need many explosions.

I could see it now, the Great Ball, fitted out like Puff, the Magic
Dragon, swooping over the battlefield with many guns blazing away,
leaving a trail of destruction. =20

Ideas?

I ask for one simple reason=85 I may start up the old game and my cast
want to be mercs!? and I need a good ship. So can I get the new revised
ships to examine. I may be interested in buying.=20

As I said in my first sentence of the above quote "actual fighting skill is secondary to the 
discipline" 
Martial arts afficinadoes get so defensive when someone questions the effectiveness of their 
Art. I simply regard them as overrated.

Agreed. I have seen bouncers who are 5\'4" stare down huge brutes. But, the truth is stilll 
the bigger they are the harder they hit, and all else being equal (or not even) bigger is 
stronger. A friend of mine (fairly big guy, 6\'2", 260 lbs) stated he preferrred kicking when 
he was involved in Martial Arts because "it doesn\'t matter if you block or not, I am big

In general, you want the best sensors you can afford.  If you can\'t 
detect the enemy, you can\'t shoot at them.  Period.

In Joe Heck\'s Role-Playing Space Combat System (RPSC), the unofficial but
highly-recommended combat system for T4, the sensor rating is a favorable DM
to the sensors task.

For example, a SDB with the TL-10 "small" package would have a +4 DM on the
sensor task using passive sensors,  If an intruder ship was at Long range
(within the very edge of weapon range) the task Staggering.  Upgrading to
the "medium" package increases the DM to +5 (for passive attempts), and if
the captain decides to "light up the night" with his active sensors, a +16 DM.

OPINIONS and OBSERVATIONS:

Not all ships in the fleet have to have the same sensor suite.  Ships that
are in contact (by tight-beam maser communicator, or by comm laser) can
share sensor data - so that one ship equipped with the good sensor package
can feed targetting data to the rest of the squadron.  Sensor drones or
purpose-designed sensor ships can also be used for this purpose.

The accepted modus operandi for SDBs calls for them to make surprise attacks
against targets of opportunity (support or supply vessels, cripples, and
ships conducting fuel scooping runs), ideally employing hit-and-run and
wolf-pack tactics.  A good communications and sensor suite is essential to
this mission (ideally, SDBs should detect their targets well before they are
themselves detected).  Long "legs" (high maneuver drive rating) is also
needed in this model, so that SDBs can break off by acelleration at will.

Different tactical doctrines will call for different sensor fits.  SDBs that
are intended to work in concert with orbital weapon/sensor platforms for the
close-in defense of a world can probably dispense with an extensive sensor
suite.  These ships would recieve targetting data from the orbital platforms
and the planetary sensor network (which could achieve locks on inbound ships
far more effectively than any sensor that would fit on the SDB).  As a
backup system, an a short-ranged active sensor might be desirable (so the
SDB could acquire locks on its own if the planetary defense network were
damaged).

I think that QSDS & SSDS are ok but I cant bring myself to putting much
effort into designing ships when there is so much limitation in both
systems. 5000 ton max, am I to believe that the Imperium does not have a
ship bigger than that, even at TL12? Get serious!?! The design sequence in
MegaTraveller was even better!  

Of all the material that has been produced for T4, ship generation has been
given secondary consideration as far as I can see.  

If I am way off base here Please let me know.  I\'m not trying to rain on

   I don\'t know, sorry.  Historically, Trav has always put limits on the
   number of missiles a ship can fire at once, and made those missiles
   fairly cheap, which is just the opposite of modern navies, where cost
   is the most important limiting factor (for cruise missiles, anyway).

   "High Guard" had a last-battery rule: if the battery that was hit was

   The numbers in T4 and Starships are USP\'s.  In other words, use 30.

   Because mass-based design systems are a major pain in the butt, and
   for all the added complication they cause, they add very little in
   the way of realism or playability.  Volume-based design systems do,
   howver, need to have their armor subsytems tweaked to avoid abuse,
   as you point out.

Ah, "Thor\'s Hammer"--1 gross ablative tipped/ceramic finned crowbars
with guidence packages.  Not necessarily very accurate, but extremely
devastating.  I played a prototype combat wargame (Armor:2050) where
this was brought onto the field -- everyone scattered to no effect.  

whisTLE BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM -- not a pretty sight.  No amount of top
armor is going to save you in that situation--only pure speed.  I can\'t
recall the time to deploy the weapon system, but it wasn\'t very
substantial. The main limitation was where your platform was in orbit--
it could take a while for the satillite to get into position-- the
actual flight time, with the package fired at a couple kps was only
about a couple of minutes.

I second that--I purchased "Guide to the Galaxy" a few years ago--worth
every last centicredit too.  I actually saw the maps in "GtoG" a few
years earlier in and issue of "The New Scientist."

I\'d love to have a 3-D map one of these days that shows the various
nebulae and dust clouds, along with the stars (It\'s hard to use some of
these VRML maps--no real reference to the plane of the galaxy or the
ecliptic...)

   Definately in the Falklands.  The Gurkas were also present.  The sight
of them with those large curved knives (Kuri) probably set more than one 17
year old conscript to quivering at the bottom of their foxhole.

   It\'s actually a matter of range.  At close range, cold steel is
terrifing.  Grenades, shotguns, and smgs are more efficent though.

A 2G thruster drive is a *lot* more expensive than a 1G thruster drive +
standard CG. Most merchant ships only need a 1G drive in space - the
reduced time-to-100-diameters from 2G is negligible. The only time they need
extra acceleration is taking off and landing; for those purposes, a CG
set is a good cost-effective buy.

Some designers might chose to underpower their ship - leaving only enough 
power to run the CG when something else (sensors, weapons, or even
grav-comp) is shut down, since you\'ll rarely need both at once.

Military ships will want to have 2G+ thrust, and some will go for the
vertically-oriented-thrusters approach with no CG; but there are still
advantages to having seperate CG and thrusters - it lets you land if your
thrusters are destroyed, or hover while using very little power (good for
ambushes in gas giants), etc.

Also, if you want to have an Airframe hull - which gives you better 
maneuverability than a Streamlined one, and lets you make landings
even with all power out - and have vertical takeoff capability, you need a
second set of engines - which might as well be CG, since it\'s cheap.

(Yes, the real reason is that we wanted to keep all the classic 
Traveller deckplans with the engines at the back...sometimes I envy 2300AD,
which wasn\'t saddled with quite so much baggage.)

Another example of this and a couple of other interesting weapon systems
using extensive guidance systems is _David\'s Sling_ by Marc Stiegler.

Well, I have found one thing...the T4 weapons damage scale is way too
coarse to make subtle distinctions between handguns. In terms of game
stats, this is no different that the Magnum Revolver listed in the game
book, except it\'s somewhat heavier, and the only difference I see between
the three guns here are the weights, and the range for the shortest barrel
version (and that\'s only if I\'m reading the conversion between 

          Damage    TL   Range     Shots     Mass Cost
Dire Wolf 25   3    8    Short     6    1.9  876
Dire Wolf 15   3    8    Short     6    1.5  738
Dire Wolf 10   3    8    VShort    6    1.3  675

     Still, this a a heck of a \'retro\' weapon to lug around, It will
make a hell of a BOOM when you fire it. I envision it styled somewhat
along the lines of a Colt Walker, rather than a Peacemaker style;
distinctive nonetheless.

     Also, in a field or scout situation, the ability to make your own
reloads in the field could come in really handy. In a really primitive
situation this gun could probably even fire black powder if you had to,
and reloading cartridges with black is incredibly easy...my Dixie Gunworks
catalog shows how to do it; all you need is a nail of the right diameter
to pop out the primer, a properly drilled out chunk of wood to hold the
shell while you put in the new primer (the catalog shows a small slab of
tree branch, about 4" in diameter). Then you just stuff the shell with
black, and hand press a round ball in.

It will have nowhere NEAR the damage value of the original, and
reliability will suffer really fast if you don\'t clean it out after every
few rounds, but it\'s entirely doable, and an incredibly cheap way to make
small game or plinking rounds, expecially for old guns that may not be
able to handle the higher loads of modern ammo. 

BTW, the round they\'re showing being reloaded in the catalog is a .50 cal
roound with a case approximately 1/2 -3/4 " long, for a Remington rolling
block single shot pistol.

   I love this idea.  It would even be possible to make this "protector
   race" more ubiquitous by turning it into a holy order of knights
   similar to Fred Saberhagen\'s Templars.  These Templars, or whatever
   you want to call them, have bases everywhere.  Since the Imperium
   doesn\'t have extradition, this order has taken it on itself to haul
   those guilty of crimes against humanity back to the worlds they
   ravaged to face charges, sort of like a cross between Amnesty
   International and a mobile Nuremburg court.  Their activities will be
   less restricted on low-law-level worlds, the same worlds where
   murderous players are likely to hang out, where they are free to
   apprehend criminals, or kill them them trying.  These protector
   orders will be popular among idealistic, violent, and young nobles
   who enjoy nothing more than wasting bad guys; they are a serious

(forthcoming) Traveller page. Any Comments?

T4 is a simple game, and I think that even when we try to add diversity to
the game we must strive not to bog the system down
with unnecessary complications.
Keeping this in mind, I\'d like to differentiate the game a little. In real
life, the various systems of unarmed combat tend to focus
on a definite set of maneuvers. I propose to let the player choose an
abstract "style" which gives a bonus on some kind of
maneuvers.
In order to preserve play balance, the system must have some drawbacks, if
this was not the case, everybody would
automatically choose the "best" style and nobody would choose straight
Brawling any more. 

During chargen, whenever the character gets a level in Brawling he may
decide which of the three main styles he wants to
study. 

Unarmed Combat: 
     Generic unarmed combat style, pragmatic and without a particular focus.
It works exactly like Brawling. 
Soft Style: 
     Similar to Judo or Aikido. These types of MA favours defense and the
use of locks/throws instead of direct strikes. This
     style bestows a +1 bonus when using grapples and throws, and gives a -1
for punching and kicking. It gives an
     additional +1 bonus when used to defend against unarmed attacks (i.e.
gives an additional -1 to the attacker).
     Example: A Judo-3 character uses Dex+2 for strikes and Dex (or Str) +4
for Grapple/Throw. Opponents using
     unarmed attacks against the character will suffer a -4 negative DM. 
Hard Style: 
     Similar to Karate. It adds +1 modifier to skill and a +1 damage bonus
when Punching and Kicking only. Apply a -1
     penalty when using throws and grapple. 
     Example: A Karate-2 character uses Dex+1 for throws and grappling
attacks, Dex+3 for punches and kicks. If the blow
     connects, s/he will inflict 1D6+1 damage.

    'body' => 'House Rule:  Multiple Actions During Combat

(Optimized For Use With Glenn Grant\'s D66 Task System)

RULE 1:  A character can perform multiple aimed fire shots up to (but not
exceeding) his skill level with a semi-automatic weapon without incurring
the multiple actions penalty.  In doing so, however, he forfets the
positive DM for aimed fire.  All shots must be fired at the same target.
The max rate of fire per round with this rule is 3.  If more than 3 shots
are fired, all shots incur the multiple actions penalty.

Here\'s an example (assume a cP003, DEX=7, and very short range):

                 ---- Skill Level ----
Total Shots Fire   1        2        3        4
- ----
1st aimed shot   43(59%)  46(67%)  53(75%)  56(83%)
2nd aimed shot   23(25%)  46(67%)  53(75%)  56(83%)
3rd aimed shot   --       26(34%)  53(75%)  56(83%)

From this we see that if a skill level 1 person fires 1 shot, it\'s at
normal values.  If he fires additional shots, they suffer the penalty.

If a skill level 2 person fires 1 or 2 shots, they are both at normal
values.  If he fires additional shots, they suffer the penalty.

If a skill level 3 or higher person fires 1, 2, or 3 shots, they are all at
normal values.  If he fires additional shots, they suffer the penalty.

*****

RULE 2:  A character can move and autofire in the same round, but the
autofire incurs an additional -12 DM.

Note:  This assumes that T4 does not allow movement while autofiring.  The
rules don\'t state one way or the other.  But even if the rules do allow it,
I wouldn\'t.  It\'s just not realistic believable.

*****

RULE 3:  A character can move and fire multiple snapfire shots with a
semi-automatic weapon in a round, but the shots incur the multiple actions
penalty.  So firing two shots has a -12 DM for each shot, firing three
shots has a -24 DM, and so on. 

Let\'s try that same example (assume a cP003, DEX=7, skill level 3, and very
short range):

autofire/move   - 26 33%
snapfire/1 shot - 53 74%
snapfire/2 shots- 33 42%
snapfire/3 shots- 13  8%

Someone in HIWG put a very nice galactic map on a web site.  It prints out as an 8.5in x 
11in sheet of paper.  The galactic core is at the top of the page, and the rim is at the 
bottom.  Known space is a very, very small square in the bottom third of the page.  The 
Zhodani core expeditions are a very, very thin line running up to just above the center 
of the page.  I\'m sorry, I don\'t have the URL, but maybe someone from HIWG (where I\'m 
cross-posting this) will post it.

You can try the same explanation when they\'re referring to a female player, and see how

I agree strongly. In both Karate and Kung fu, the most basic tenet I have
been taught (and which I try to pass on to students) is that a good student
is one who avoids getting into a fight in the first place.

If only I could convince my gun-toting Traveller players of this... :-)

bigger is nothing if the opponent knows the right nerve points. Sorry, but
brute strength can easily be overcome by appropriate active (nerve point) or
passive (e.g. many Aikido) techniques.

Again, my players will try this. And their characters aren\'t even martial
artists. They\'re just... er, over confident? Comes of watching too many
Schwarzenegger films. ;-)

Ah ha! Found the next reply too, from Mused <marz@HotStar.net>:

>Martial arts afficinadoes get so defensive when someone questions the
effectiveness of their Art. I simply regard them as overrated.

Depends very much upon which branch, style, etc. For example, much of modern
day Shotokan karate has been altered from its original (Okinawan) lethality
because the forms which reached the US and Europe after WWII were often
based upon the exercises for school children created by Gichin Funakoshi in
the 1920s. Naturally he didn\'t leave in all the nasty bits for the
children!!! :-)

>the bigger they are the harder they hit,

Depends if you\'re silly enough to stay in the way of the punch!

>A friend of mine (fairly big guy, 6\'2", 260 lbs) stated he preferrred
kicking when 
>he was involved in Martial Arts because "it doesn\'t matter if you block or

Except that kicks are generally slower than hand attacks, plus you have to
have sufficient range between you and the opponent to use a kick
effectively, plus the "you can block it if you want" theory supposes that
you don\'t get out of the way of the kick at the same time.

>> I believe in the art of ching-chunk (sound of SMG being cocked)

There is an appropriate time and place for almost any type of combat. The
value is in having as many different options open as possible, and knowing
when to use which technique. :-)

(He says, trying to fit one paragraph into this e-mail which justifies
posting this to the TRAVELLER mailing list...) :-)

In the Falklands War, the Gurkha kukri blade was also a psychological operation.  The 
Argentine troops at one point expressed their concern over facing the Gurkhas, and the 
locals started telling them stories of how the Gurkhas would typically infiltrate an 
encampment at night and behead every sleeping enemy:  "It\'s easy to tell if a Gurkha has 
paid a visit.  When you get up in the morning, turn your head.  If your head falls off, 
you\'ve had a Gurkha."  I read about this in Newsweek or Time soon after the war.

Where do you get the impression that the Imperium is an essentially egalitarian 
democratic society?  It is ruled at the top by a hereditary autocrat, aided by 
entrenched bureaucracies and a naval and military (and internal intelligence) apparatus 
dominated by a hereditary noble class. The Imperial officials downstream, in charge of 
various regions of the Imperium, are all nobles, from the Archdukes who control several 
sectors to the Barons who control only a small part of a single world.  

All political power in the Imperium (as opposed to the member states) is held by the 
nobility, as is all significant wealth -- and when you\'re talking about an entity of the 
Imperium\'s size, "significant wealth" is such that the Sultan of Brunei is a pauper.  

Nevertheless, the Imperium is a self-limited government.  It basically lets its member 
states handle their own internal affairs.  Thus a member state can be as egalitarian and 
democratic -- or whatever -- as it wants.  

It\'s true that Imperial citizens have signifiant freedom of movement.  That supports the 
Imperium\'s policy of enhancing interstellar trade -- not least because the movement of 
labor is an essential part of interstellar trade (and of course the interstellar 
movement of goods requires people to move them).  Likewise, exploration within and 
outside the Imperium ultimately serves commercial purposes.  There is no reason for the 
Imperium to place many restrictions on freedom of movement.  

On the other hand, freedom of information doesn\'t really exist.  The Imperium wants to 
give the impression that information flows freely, and a lot of information does, of 
course -- otherwise commerce and society would grind to a halt.  Nevertheless, Imperial 
and corporate manipulation of the news is widespread -- look at the Psionics 
Suppressions for an example of spun news spinning a situation out of control.  Any 
entity strives to control information to the extent that it needs to do so for its own 
security (indeed, the law today even recognizes that communications between a husband 
and wife are confidential, and their disclosure cannot be forced).  The Imperium, as a 
tool for keeping wealth and power in the hands of the wealthy and powerful, certainly 
exerts substantial control over the flow of information in the Imperium.  

So, to turn to your first question, what are the rights and privileges -- and 
obligations -- of Imperial nobility (as opposed to local nobility, whose situations vary 
too much for discussion here)?  In brief, they are wealth, power, and a measure of 
security, offset or balanced by duty to serve the Imperium, the Emperor, and possibly 
the Archduke and other upstream lieges (depending on your particular oaths of fealty).  
Specifically, each patent of nobility will spell out what the holder of the patent gets 
and has to do; there are probably some Imperial edicts on point as well.

Sure!  

First, you (or your referee) may want to go and pick up a copy of Joe Heck\'s
Role-Playing Space Combat System.  Although it\'s unofficial, I think you\'ll
find that it\'s a lot better than the combat system that comes with the basic
T4 rulebook.  At least, I think so - and I highly recommend it (however, I
did contribute to it, so I may be slighly biased).  You can retrieve a copy
over the Web, from:
     http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/rpsc/
It\'s available as an Adobe Acrobat document, so you can download it and
print it for reference during play.

T4 includes "detonation laser" missiles.  These are missiles that use a
small nuclear charge to power (single use!) X-ray lasers.  Sand protects
against these kind of missiles, just like it protects against other laser
attacks.  Sand doesn\'t help against other types of missiles.

> and it is not mentioned in QSDS. 

QSDS is designed to the level of detail that\'s used by the T4 basic rules
and the RPSC.  At this level of detail, each sand cannister reduces the
strength of the incoming laser attack by 1 point.

One cannister.

To ease the flow of game play, RPSC (and T4 basic rules) have the sandcaster
gunner perform the scandcaster task in reaction to a laser hit.  Obviously,
there\'s no way that a cannister is actually launched after a hit; instead,
this simulates events on the target ship.  By detecting the attacker\'s
targetting sensors and/or near misses by the attacker\'s weapons, the
defending sandcaster gunner launches a cannister of sand.  This sand is
gravitically or electromagnetically controlled by the sandcaster gunner.

> Do you group them into batterys and assign a MFD?

Not under the present rules.

> Does the sand go away after each turn?

One cannister lasts about a turn; as the ship maneuvers and evades, the sand
is slowly dissipated (no matter how well the gunner controls it).

> If it\'s a high tech sand caster with a control module to gravitically

> missles after they\'re launched?

I prefer to think of it more like the asteriod ring defense system used by
the Argo (Yamato) in Starblazers (Space Cruiser Yamato).  ;-)

> 2. Missles - why is the number of missles a MFD can control an issue? 

The default missiles in Traveller are guided from the firing ship.  These
are called "controlled" missiles, since they\'re operated by remote control
from the MFD.  Each MFD can control a certain number of missiles
(higher-tech MFDs have better computers, and can control a larger number).

> Can\'t you have missles that aquire a target and then follow it on their
> own?

Yes.  These would be FIMs (Fully-Indepenedent Missiles) or SIMs
(Semi-Independent Missiles).  Rules for them are not included in the basic
game.

> 3. Computer Program "Select" - this program was useful in CT for taking
> out drives or weapon systems.  Why was this omitted in T4?

The combat model used in T4 assumes extremely long ranges (up to several
light-seconds); at these ranges, hitting an enemy ship is a probabilistic
thing.  Over the course of a combat turn you fire many (anywhere from 10 to
800, depending on the weapon) shots at the enemy\'s possible future position,
in the hopes that one (or maybe more) of them will connect.

> How do you still shoot out specific systems, and does armor then apply?

Unless you can get very, very close to the enemy, you can\'t target specific
systems.  If you do manage to get this close, it\'ll be up to the referee to
determine how to resolve the fire.  In general idea is that there are
"surface" hit locations (things like weapon firing ports, sensor arrays, and
maneuver drive ports) that can\'t be armored.  "Internal" locations are
behind armor.

> 4. If a weapon hit is scorred in combat, T4 indicates that the battery is
> destroyed.

In RPSC, there are two types of weapon hits: a Weapon Mount hit, which
destroys a single weapon mount (after damage control bypasses the mount, the
battery can return to combat at reduced capacity), or Weapon Battery (an
internal hit), that knocks out the central machinery for the battery.

>  Wouldn\'t this result is a bunch of batterys with just a few
> turrets each being much bettter than a few batterys with many turrets? 

A few batteries with many turrets are better at hitting the target, and do
more damage when they do hit.

> per point of damage scorred.

RPSC does this; the T4 basic rules don\'t.

> 5. The recent "Numeric Armor vs. Armor USP Rating" discussions on the

The USP value (30) is what\'s used in T4 basic combat.  RPSC uses a different
armor value (based on the USP value), and it\'s explained in the RPSC rules.

>  For the ship presented in T4 and Starships, the listed armor is which number?

The listed value _should_ be the USP value, and this is the one you want to
use for starship combat.  The other ("SSDS value") is used only when
designing the ship with SSDS.

> 6. Mass of Starships - Why is volume used to determine thrust rather
> than mass?

Because computing the drives based on mass is a pain, and mass would be
one more column to keep track of during ship design.  SSDS (the ship design
system in the starships book) does require the designer to keep track of
a ship\'s mass.

> This means that any 400 dt ship requires the same drive to
> achieve 4G of thrust, regardless of the armor or systems on the ship.

It\'s assumed that the ship will mass no more than 15 metric tons per
displacement ton, and will average 10 metric tons per displacement ton.  The
drives are computed from volume based on this assumption, and if you round
thrust to the nearest whole G, the volume-based method will achieve the same
results as the detailed mass-based computation.

QSDS has been designed so that (unless you fill the cargo hold with steel
ingots or gold bars) you have to really try hard to build a design that
exceeds 15 metric tons mass per displacement ton of volume.

No.  A sandcaster launches a cannister of "sand" (actually prismatic
crystals) that dissipate the energy of laser beams.  Some T4 missiles fire
lasers at their targets, so sand can be used against these missiles.

Striker was referring to the effect of a cannister of sand (which is
launched at a fairly high velocity) on unarmored or lightly-armored ground
troops.  The effect is rather like a full-body sandblaster (or, as Striker
mentioned, a giant shotgun shell).

Couldn\'t you just nudge them (Iceburgs in the Oort cloud) making them into
comets, and catch them later? Yes it\'s a drag hanging out there at the edge

I have lost my Solomani Alien module, and since i cant buy a T4 equivalent

First terran Jump?
Date of the first war?
Date of the last war (that took out the imperium)?

Well, that depends on what you\'re trying to do doesn\'t it?

Karate chop.... well it\'s two steps worse than an "Impossible" task, so
if you can hit at all it\'s going to be an SS.  So: you managed to jam a
servo - one joint on the DB locks, slowing him down some but not much
else.

Knife... See Karate chop.

Hand gun... OK, you can hit, but it doesn\'t DO anything normally.  So:
You hit a joint, joint no longer works, and does half damage to the
person inside.

Big gun... Well it normally isn\'t going to do much, but... So: you
caught a weak spot (joint, place hit before, natural fracture, external
system pod)  one system on the DB ceases to function, depending on the
item broken anywhere from double damage (minus armor) to nothing occurs
to the person inside.

Claymore... Well, without a SS you don\'t hit anyway, so nothing special,
you just get to hit.

FGMP... You\'re WORRIED about DB?

May be a matter of semantics. Sandcasters could be considered a form of
shields in that the sand is manipulated and shaped by the ejecting ship to
stop inbound energy weapons. It works best on lasers, but the assumption
(per TNE) of missle warheads acutally being disposable high intensity X-ray
lasers, makes it effective against missiles as well.

Meson \'screens\' are also shields, highly specialized shields for a specific
form of attack, but shields all the same.

Black and White Globe generators also function as shields, in a more classic
sense, but with special considerations and potential penalties.

Traveller doesn\'t have a generic stops everything and it\'s cousin with no
cost shields that some Sci-Fi uses.  After all, when Spock says that the
deflectors are down to 50%, what is it 50% of? In Traveller, we can use 50%
of the sandcaster cannisters; the mesons screens may have only 5 megawatts
of power input instead of the normal 10, or the Black/White globe energy
sinks (capacitors) may be 50% loaded.

Our handwaving explanations may be be of any higher quality, but we do have
a wider variety of movemets to use.

     Traveller never had shields like Star Trek because Traveller is not Star
Trek.

     Seriously, different imaginary universes behave differently. Your
assumption that Traveller is more of a "hard" science fiction universe than
Star Trek or Star Wars is probably correct. That\'s what attracted me to it
originally, and is why it\'s the only game I\'ve kept an interest in for a
decade and a half. Traveller has always _tried_ to have some kind of
explanation for most of its futuristic things, anti-gravity and jump drives
aside.

It\'s worth noting that a 2G T-Plate drive is larger, more expensive, and
uses more power than a 1G T-Plate drive and CG Lifters (CG Lifters are about
a third the cost and power consumption of equivalent T-Plates).  A military
fighter might be designed this way, for the additional maneuverability.
In this case, the cost premium would be worth it.

Oriflamme subsectors and cut-and-pasted them together.  (I added the four
additional subsectors from _Smash_and_Grab_ when I got that.)  I also
included the 17xx column for So Skire subsector (based on an old issue of
the Keith Brothers\' _High_Passage_ magazine), for reasons that will become
apparent below.  

A cursory analysis of the astrography and Tech Levels of the RC will lead
one to the assumption that jump-2 (not jump-1) is the default capability
of starships in the RC, for the following reasons:

1.  Jump-1 is insufficient for a starship to be able to go from any one
system in the RC to any other system in the RC, however long a path the
ship\'s captain is willing to traverse.  (FWIW: Almost every J-1 free
trader IMC has an additional 20 tons of fuel tankage installed in the
cargo hold to give them a 2-parsec range.)

2.  Jump-3 is a luxury.  TL-12 J-3 ships can be given their annual
maintenance *only* at Aubaine, whereas TL-11 J-2 ships can be maintained
at Aurora or Kruyter, possibly even Eos, as well as at Aubaine.

With this assumption in mind, I took a copy of my cut-and-pasted map, and
I used a yellow highlighter to trace every J-1 and J-2 connection possible
for every star system on the map.  I then colored in with blue highlighter 
the "gulfs" or "voids" that were left behind.  The resulting colorized map
vividly illustrated the weakness inherent to the astrography of the RC;
namely, that even with J-2, a ship could take an enormous number of jumps
to go from one system in the RC to another, regardless of the true
distance between the systems.  

I also mentioned this weakness in a paper I posted to the TML ("Relic IISS
Ships and Deep-Space Refueling" or some such title).  In this paper, I
came to the following conclusions:

1.  Relic Xboats would be valuable reserves of spare high-performance
jump drive components.

2.  Relic Xboat Tenders would be modified for use as tankers, and could
be used by the RC to support a series of deep-space fueling stations.  A
squadron based at Baldur would support the d/s sites at 0833 and 1034.
Another squadron based at Shenandoah would support the d/s sites at 0938
and 1137.  (BTW: The publicly stated reason for these stations is "to
promote interstellar commerce within the RC"; the fact that these stations
expedite *official* [i.e., non-civilian] traffic is not entirely a
coincidence.  :-)

My reasoning for the location of these d/s sites was based on the "gulfs"
I discovered by my colored map.  For a campaign *not* using the d/s sites,
these gulfs would force starships to make a longer circuit around the
perimeter of a gulf, depending on where the captain was and where he
wanted to go.  In other words, these gulfs *cannot* be crossed by J-2
ships; they can only be *circumnavigated*.  

The first gulf is circuited as follows:  Helios connects to L\'steich
(1333) which connects to Junak (1432) which connects to Nimz (1633) which
connects to Lamnath (1735/So Skire) which connects to Tuer (1636) which
connects to Teldora (1437) which connects to Spencer which connects to
Shenandoah which connects to Lucifer which connects to Conner (0840) which
connects to Seliga (0640) which connects to Schall which connects to
Aubaine and/or Phoebus; Phoebus connects to Spires which connects to Zloga
which connects to Oriflamme and/or Helios.  

The second of the two large gulfs is circuited as follows:  Helios
connects to L\'steich (1333) which connects to Corrig (1331) which connects
to Bestor (1131) which connects to Ra, Enkidu, and/or Baldur; both Ra and
Enkidu connect to Nike Nimbus which connects to Eos which connects to
Adrian (0432) which connects to Fija which connects to Aurora which
connects to Kruyter which connects to Spires which connects to Zlogha
which connects to Oriflamme and/or Helios.

There is a third, smaller gulf circuited by Aurora, Kruyter, Phoebus,
Aubaine, Schall, Vezina, and Apollo; however, as any system on this
circuit is three jumps away or less from any other, this isn\'t nearly as
serious a problem.  

The d/s sites at 0833 and 1034 take care of the first gulf, and the d/s
sites at 0938 and 1137 take care of the second gulf.  The d/s sites at
1034 and 1137 are so important to Oriflamme that the Oriflamme system navy
has a squadron of its own to give additional support to these sites (and
to help cover up their support of the secret d/s sites some Oriflammen
technarchs have built at 1434, 1435, and 1535, but that\'s /another/
story...  :-)

Even with the d/s sites, Adrian (0432) is still the best (i.e., shortest)
path for traffic between Fija and either Eos or Nike Nimbus.  Thus, IMC,
Adrian is the site a small facility that makes some of its money refueling
these ships.  (*Most* of its money is made from scavenging the TL-14 relic
equipment.)  

Also, some crazy misanthrope of a belter (i.e., a retired PC :-)
discovered a cometary body in deep space at 0636 which he\'s converted into
a d/s site to expedite high-priority traffic between Aurora (HQ RCN) and
Aubaine (RC capital).  As the character in question is already filthy rich
and a loner besides, this suits him just fine (it takes all kinds, I
guess...).  This takes care of any high-priority traffic around the third
gulf wanting to trim one or two weeks off their transit time.  

*******************************************************************************

CIN/Aurora, 1/X/1202:

An official spokesman from the Public Affairs Office of the RC Navy issued
a press statement today announcing the establishment of four deep-space
refueling stations within the RC borders.  This doesn\'t come as much of a
surprise, as the existence of these four d/s stations has been one of the
worst-kept secrets in the history of the RC.  The four stations are
located at 0833/Aubaine, 0938/Oriflamme, 1034/Oriflamme, and
1137/Oriflamme.  These stations are being supported by two squadrons of
Oasis-class tankers (modified relic Xboat tenders).  Sahara squadron is
based out of Baldur and services the stations at 0833 and 1034.  Gobi
squadron is based out of Shenandoah and services the stations at 0938 and
1137.  

These stations are open to the general starfaring public (in fact, these
stations were supposedly established "to promote interstellar commerce
within the RC"), but be advised that the stations themselves and the
surrounding "airspace" within a radius of 300,000 kilometers are under
martial law due to the hazardous environment.  Be sure to follow *all*
established protocols for these situations.  

Also included in this press release was an announcement that the RCN is
accepting bids from civilian enterprises to assume responsibility for
maintaining these stations.  

*******************************************************************************

CIN/Aubaine, 1/IV, 1202:

McKenzie Holdings, a salvage company registered out of Aubaine, has
formally established a legal claim to Adrian (0432/Aubaine; new UWP is
D426112-9).  The new starport is class D, and was expanded from a former
class G spaceport.  The new starport has a few repair bays capable of
handling small ships (200 tons or less).  Refined fuel is available at the
starport, as well as lodging and food.  Currently, about 30 sentients 
permanently live at McKenzie Station.  

McKenzie Holdings has provided RCES with a small facility for use as a
scout base, at no cost to RCES.  They have also formally petitioned for
status as a client-state of the RC.  

McKenzie Holdings makes most of its money at Adrian by salvaging the relic
TL-14 equipment.  They also make some money servicing the ships going
between Fija and Eos and Nike Nimbus (as the shortest route from Fija to
either of these worlds is by way of Adrian).

*******************************************************************************

CIN/Phoebus, 4/VII/1202:

A cometary body has been found in deep-space at astrographical coordinate
0636/Aubaine, and a fueling station will be established there by Singh,
Singh, and Co., a recently formed corporation registered here in Phoebus.
The comet was discovered by James (Jimmy) Singh, a belter originally from
Aurora.  

The rights to this comet were supposedly leased to the RC Navy at Aurora 
just a few weeks ago for an undislosed sum of money, but apparently there
was a loophole written into the contract by his sister, Lilith (Lily)
Singh.  The contract forbid Mr. Singh from reselling these rights "to any
party not mentioned in this contract."  As Ms. Singh was listed in the
contract as her brother\'s agent, he was legally able to sell mining rights
to her even after leasing these rights to the RCN.  

The fueling station being built by Singh, Singh, and Co. will supposedly
be open to the general starfaring public and will have refined fuel
available for the standard price.  

There has been no offical comment by the Public Affairs Office of the RCN
on this matter.  An anonymous source is quoted as saying "I\'m angrier at 
the [bureaucrat] who signed the contract than I am at [Ms. Singh].
[Laywers] can\'t help they way they are.  It\'s genetic or something, like
being a microbe."

*******************************************************************************

CIN/Aurora, 27/VII/1202:

An official spokesman from the Public Affairs Office of the RC Navy issued
a press statement today announcing that unlicensed, unregulated mining by
the general starfaring public will be permitted at the deep-soace
cometary body located at astrographical coordinate 0636/Aubaine.  Thus,
the crew of a ship jumping to this coordinate in deep-space will be able
to refuel their ship at no cost (other than time).  This is obviously in
response to the action initiated by Singh, Singh, and Co. reported by
CIN/Phoebus on 4/VII/1202.

I pictured sandcasters like thse used by attack choppers, a sand looking

You\'re thinking of chaff (radar spoofing) or flares (IR spoofing).
 
Sand will, however also work in the shotgun mode in a way.  Remember
that it doesn\'t matter if the shotgun blast moves, or if the target
moves into a "stationary" cloud of sand.

So plain old missiles that have to contact the target have to move
through the sand cloud.  At the one or two hundred kilometers per
second that the missile is moving, the unmoving sand is far nastier 
than any shotgun blast (which is more like 0.3km/s).

As I recall, modern heavy artillery manages 2 to 3 rounds per minute per

How many troops does that particular one carry?  It\'s a heck of a lot better
than nothing, but ideally you\'d want 8 or a dozen of the things to act as a
battery of artillery.

True, but 18 seconds is a lot better than 30 seconds to a minute for
modern-day artillery to correct fire.  There\'s no "time-to-target", because
the "rounds" travel at nearly the speed of light.  As soon as the ship has
the fire order in the gunnery computer, shots begin to arrive.

The Merc Cruiser\'s forward observer will certainly have a surface-to-orbit
commo, so fire orders and corrections will go in as fast as he can talk.

> And would be the time on target?

Well, let\'s do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.  Beginning with an
iron rod the size of a crowbar (let\'s call it 5kg, including a small
laser-spot-seeker in the nose, and some small fins on the back for terminal
guidance).  I seem to remember that the laser-seeker conversion kits for
modern-day bombs are pretty cheap, so let\'s call the guidance package around
Cr 1000.

Since this will be used in close orbit around a world, we can equip it with
a Contra-Grav unit (4 cubic meters and 2.4Mw, and 13 tons thrust at TL-9),
and a 1 cubic meter storage bank (this will run the CG for 10 minutes).
This is all at TL-9; it gets smaller and cheaper at highter TLs.

A standard starship missile is 7 cubic meters; we\'ll fill the rest of the
space with penetrators (1 cubic meters and about 7 tons; that\'s some 1,400
"crowbars") and reserve a cubic meter for packaging, guidance, and other
stuff.  The end result should do about 1G, cost around Cr 18,000 (plus
the cost of the penetrators, which could easily exceed MCr 1, if they cost
Cr 1000 each).

This device can achieve a delta-vee (change in velocity) of about 6,000 m/s
which should be sufficient to de-orbit the crowbars with extreme prejudice,
and the entire thing can be launched from a standard starship missile
launcher.  Assuming that the "crowbars" will hit at about 5,000 m/s, each
one has the energy of 125Mj (about 30kg of high explosive).  And each one is
(at least potentially) homing in on a target designated by your troops.

The only major problem is the time-to-target.  A ship in low orbit isn\'t
always in the right area to launch one of these; the worst case involves
nearly an entire orbit (about an hour and a half) before the crowbars
arrive; even under the best case, it\'s about 10 minutes.  And fire
correction takes about the same.  These things are more useful for taking
out rear-area targets that don\'t move around much.

On the other hand, they can be _very_ useful for that.  If you can observe
the enemy\'s command posts, supply dumps, and other static targets from
orbit, then a single ship with four missile turrets can have a total of a
dozen of these things (almost 17 thousand crowbars) fall on targets anywhere
on the world within a couple of hours.

You can have larger chunks of metal; if you assume that the main cost of a
"crowbar" is the guidance unit, a device with six 150kg "anvils" would be
much cheaper (around Cr 24,000 all told), and would deliver the rough
equivalent of a 2000-pound armor-piercing bomb (3,750Mj) per anvil.  A volley
of these (a dozen devices, and a total of 72 "anvils") is the rough equivalent
of an airstrike.  Anywhere you want, time-to-target of 2 hours or less.

The ship\'s meson gun is your artillery; the deadfall ordinace is your air
force.  The only problem now is re-supply, particularly of deadfall
ordinance.

     Well, basically, as you already know (but the list doesn\'t), the
voting scheme as you proposed it basically involved thought and
deliberation: basically, voters had to go over the entire set of entries
multiple times, which was rather timeconsuming.

     The 1-10 rating system goes a lot faster; voters just bang in their
impressions of each ship and then move onto the next one.  It\'s easier on
the voters that way, although the guy running the THUDDD has to do more
work.

     Overall, though, I\'m really pleased by how the THUDDD concept seems
to be working; we\'ve got a slew of Far Trader variants, and a bunch of Merc
Cruisers with enough variety to really add flavour to a campaign.

     So what\'s the next ship class, O THUDDDMeister :)?

I can\'t resist: the Millenium Falcon also has shields. They were

The reason Traveller never had the standard run of the mill shields is that
nobody has described what they are or what they do ie <"not serious" sci-fi
technology>

Deathstar in Jedi had a shield powered from the Endor moon that Han and
those cute little Ewooks (hate, hate, hate) blew up to enable the good guys
to fly into the reactor and blow it up again.

I have a series of rules for random generation of the entire facilities of a
starport, down to the level of what sort of docks are used, descriptions of
starport regulations, etc. It allows you to have more than one port per
system and uses a UWP-style code to record the size, level of traffic,
quality, facilities, etc. of each port. It is hoped that it will form part
of a future IG product (from the CORE group). It is currently undergoing a
period of testing; at the conclusion of this period I shall be looking for a
few playtesters from the TML to give their comments.

I\'ve always imagined "Nobles" (as in the career) as being akin to the
British Empire UCT (Upper Class Twit). Gentleman (and woman) adventurers who
set off with firm jaws, a classical education, and a belief in manifest
destany and Noblese Oblige to build an empire despite the best attempts of
the British government to avoid it. Clive of India, Cecil Rhodes,
TC Lawerence, Stanley Livingstone et al.

The characteristic of a noble are (IMHO): independent means, a wide based
liberal education, well conected friends, a sense of history and destiny,
and a desire to do something "worthwhile" without exactly what being clearly
defined.

Not exactly true. In ninjutsu (I have to take this example, because I
know it best), there is a part of the training, called kajutsu, which
deals with firearms, there use, defense against them, as well as various
matters of explosives.
In modern ninjutsu (bujinkan dojos) there are seminars of combat
shooting and similar things.

So if not in other MA, in ninjutsu firearms PLAY an important roll.

The British have a long tradition of effective use of cold steel, as well
as an equally long one of scaring their opponents by "horror" stories about
"colonial native troops". During the 2nd WW the effectiveness of the 28th
Maori bn was greatly increased by rumours that they were still cannibals.
The one about the Kukri and heads falling off later dates back to the
1st WW (along with the myth that the Kukri can\'t be reseathed until its
drawn blood - unture BTW). The British have long understood that the concept
that your opponents are trained to and enjoy sticking you with sharp objects
has a profound pyschological effect.

The really great advantage of cold steel is silence. If you want to take out
a lone sentry, anything else will make too much noise.

Interesting idea, but in the interest of game balance, make it extremely
short range (1-10 meters maybe) and easily shielded against.  Otherwise
there should be a Maser Rifle in the T4 main weapons page.

A bit unrealistic, but a missile (more likely a rocket) which is
specifically designed to deploy mines is a present day reality.  Designing
a missile which becomes a mine has many cons I wont go into, but the one
I\'ll point out is that the two missilns are not usually compatible (area
denial vs. surgical or area strike).

This robot better have a TL12 or better brain.  The technical problems
are; 1) Identifying friend or foe, 2) anti-spoofing IFF, 3) adapting to
tactical changes intelligently.  Basically you need a pretty smart robot
brain except in specific circumstances (maybe all the creatures on the
planet are targets?).  You will need to overcome or avoid the problem
behind these limitations at TL10, which won\'t be easy, but could be a fun
adventure to deal with some "armageddon robot" left to kill a whole planet
by a vengeful losing side (Bolo anyone?).

Skip the target recognition.  Too easy to spoof and too easy to identify a
friend as foe.  The tripwire laser can travel a few hundred meters in 4-5
directions and, when tripped, a full power laser with targetting optics is
triggered along the same path.  These should be deployed in overlapping  
fields of fire.  Even with this, I can think of several ways to
short-circuit the mines.  Making them explosive with certain conditions
helps a bit.

A HEAP round (High Explosive Armor Piercing) does precisely what you are
describing.  A block of explosive is shaped to form a cone with some
explosion reflecting material behind it and the opening of the cone facing
the target (its more complicated than this, but that\'s as much as I know
about it).  This has the effect of forming a jet of superheated gas, aka
plasma, directed at the target, which literally vaporizes the surface the
material of vehicle hulls and such.

You can bet that future development of armor piercing rounds will require
the jet to be hotter, last longer, have followup charges of the same
nature (which exists currently I think), use other type of technlogies
(like lasers or direct plasma "beams"), etc. etc.  So your on the right
track.

No canon answer, but why use  a beam weapon in this manner?  Beam
weapons, unlike rockets, do not use up most of the components of the
weapon system in their firing.  In fact only energy is used up (unless you
somehow "overpower" the components, which would likely result in the
weapon blowing up). 

I think trying to design a beam weapon that is disposable like the LAW
would result in a just-as-effective weapon at a much higher cost.

There was a rocket gun in (I think) Megatraveller.  It used ammo that had
tiny jets in the nose which propelled it instead of a charge behind.  It
was more effective than a conventional rifle, but not much.  Higher
damage, lower accuraccy, more reliability (no real parts in the rifle; it
was basically just a tube and aiming mechanism), higher signature.

Now the weapon I think you\'re looking for is the 40mm rapid fire grenade
launcher.  You saw these on some of the Hummers in Desert Storm.  It
looked like a fat stubby barrelled blocky machine gun.  It fires 40mm
grenades in either direct fire or indirect fire mode.  i got to tour the
USS Boulder (an LST) when they were recruiting in Chicago once, the
marines on board were showing off their toys.  My often faulty memory
tells me the guy with the  GL thought he could pretty
much "clense" a "hillside" from a couple miles away.

Someone else will answer your G3G specific questions, but as far as being
compatible, it is.  For may things like explosives you may want to come up
with more "role-playing" type results.  If a bad guy has plastic explosive
go off while stuck to his forehead, he dies, no rolls needed.  Likewise
I\'ve usually decided ahead of time whether a certain door or wall will be
way tougher than the explosive being used against it can penetrate, or
collapse easily under its influence (and perhaps taking the ceiling too).

Agreed.  Traveller presents a sharp-edged technological universe in which
any logical positivist would be happy.  Logical positivists are also known
to like the cha-chunk sound made when cocking an SMG. :)

Given this, psionics in Traveller always seemed to me to be a useful
oddity; the exception that proves the rule in a way.  I\'m fooling around
now with some plot devices (and physical devices) that could make a form of
psionics much more prevalent in a Traveller campaign.  I want to do this in
a way that is completely explainable (at least to the same level of detail
and veracity as anything else in a futuristic game), and that yet comes
across as somewhat mystical -- though the players could easily react to
this mystical view with derision or reverance (okay, think Han Solo\'s vs
Obi Wan\'s attitude in Star Wars).  In other words, I don\'t intend to make
it clear right off whether these psionics are for real, are _truly_
inexplicable from a technological point of view, or whether they\'re just
another application of known physical laws.  That may be one thing the
players have to find out on their own, if they think it\'s relevant.  

So what are your thoughts on this?  Have you fooled around much with
psionics in your games other than as a rare NPC-used device?  Do you think
it\'s better to leave Traveller "unsullied by such claptrap" (that\'s a quote
from an old ref of mine :) )?  Or is it possible to include systematic
psionics in a way that adds new dimensions to the game without removing its
technologically inspired clarity?  This last is what I\'m going for, but I\'d
like to hear others\' thoughts.

Thanks.

I _third_ that!

"The Guide to the Galaxy" is an excellent book on astronomy. The book
provides a brief history of astronomy followed by several chapters that
deal with each of the Milky Way\'s stellar arms and what you might find
there.

The maps are fantastic. You\'ll see a lot of familiar names among the stars
and see that the founding fathers of Traveller at least _attempted_ to pay
some obeisance to astronomical reality (even if they did misplace Alpha
Crucis and Deneb!).

Very inspiring for a Traveller player and not dry in tone as you might
expect from a scientific book.

I\'ll post the publisher info tomorrow for those of you who may be
interested. If a former English major like myself can get such great
enjoyment from a scientific tome, even the most non-gearhead among us
should be able to enjoy this book!

Best,

Chris

   may want to join them up with the Templars to keep them out of
   trouble!<<<

Wow.  Great idea! If anyone wants to develop material for this order I
would love to add this to my universe. I have some basic thoughts:

Ships: In addition to their noble yachts I figure that the Templars
would have something like the Merc Crusers, but with fewer troops and
more specialist. Possably something like the ships from TNE that are
doing bootstrap operations. Multipurpose (modular?) ships that conduct
operations from helping with national distaters to crushing pirate bases
to rebuilding after a raid. 

Troops: Nobles with guards, hired mercanaries in the best armor money
can buy (Daddy wants jr. to come home alive). Often the Templars will do
more damage saving a community then the raid, what with all the fusion
gun fire.

Bases: Only on the best, most conformable planets. They want to be able
to R&R in the lap of luxury.Well equiped, and full of PR and lawers to
pull jr. out of the fire. 

Official Imperium view: More of a nuisance, but can do little to stop
them. Will sometimes step in with overwhelming force if they get out of
hand. The locals will love or hate depending past experience.  

Internal Politics: Two or three different factions. The purest who truly
believe and have a religious zeal to how they go about their business.
The militants who are only in for the blood.  And the power hungry, who
only want to control and make money.

Thoughts, ideas?

Agreed, but what are the inplications of a microwave gun?  Why is a laser

lasers are more efficient than masers?

I remember a while back in TNE & FF&S days we invented the particle 
detonator.  It used an explosive energy cartidge(like the ones used for 
P/FGMP\'s) to power a grenade which would discarge a Particle Wave Field, 
basicaly a particle beam with a spherical area of efect.  We also invented 
the \'thermal detinator\'  this was done by accident when the first 
experiments our scientist did with explosive cartidges when one  went off. 
 the result was a plasma explosion.  So I would have to say yes, you can 
make these things.  Basicaly make a plasma thrower with no exit hole, 
ka-blammo!

logical: It is an innate ability that exists in rare individuals; under
the right conditions it can be brought out and trained. the Zhodani have

course they know a lot more about it than the Impies.

Human history is replete with tales of prophets, wizards and fantastically
lucky gamblers; most tales are untrue or exaggerated, but there\'s a grain
of truth in most tales.

Given the rarity of the trait, and the difficulty of controlling or
identifying it before it\'s accepted as real, works against accepting it as
real. It\'s really hard to develop a truly statitistically significant
sample when a significant numbr of people claim what you\'re trying to
study doesn\'t exist, and you can\'t consistently find proof otherwise.

I think, at least in terms of Traveller history, not much reputable,
supported work will be done on psionics until contact with the Zhodani.
Then there will be a huge covert Imperial \'arms race\' to develop it. an
outgrowth of that covert research could easily be the disastrous effects
of the Psionics supressions...they were simply trying to keep large number
of people not under the direct control of the Imperial intelligence
apparatus from learning the techniques. When the Supressions flared from
public disapproval of psionics to the outright pogroms that did occur,
Imperial policy could have easily been \'Cut our losses, and take the
official research even deeper underground...until then, we\'re conveniently
rid of a possible fifth column for the Zho\'s\' Whether or not that was the
official policy, that was the actual effect.

universe.  Although I play in a pretty standard setting (current year 
is 1105), I don\'t like to see things that I\'ve bought for other games 
go to waste--especially if I don\'t plan to play that game again.

One of the things that I\'m using in my Traveller campaign are the 
Kafers from T2300.  You may have some of the same T2300 supplements 
collecting dust in your game closet.  In this post, I\'m going to show 
you how I incorporated this enemy into my current Trav game.  Maybe 
it will give you some ideas for your own game.



My Campaign:  The Grand Adventure.

I\'m running a pretty detailed and involved campaign.  For those of 
you who have seen some of my Grand Adventure posts, you\'ll already 
know a little about this thing.  If you haven\'t seen them, I know 
that Peter Miller has taken some of my posts from here on the TML and 
put them on his web site.  If you are interested, you can link there 
from the Imperium Games link page.

For those of you who don\'t know much about my campaign--you don\'t 
need to know much.  This is a good thing, because explaining all of 
the intricacies involved in this campaign, which has been going on 
for a year, is much like trying to explain all of the details of 
Babylon 5 in just a few sentences.  

Everything you need to know about how I integrated the Kafers into my 
game is posted here.

WARNING:  TRAVELLER ADVENTURE SPOILER INFORMATION BELOW.    

I am currently playing the Traveller Adventure, although I have 
changed it considerably.  Still, if you are playing the TA, you might 
not want to read beyond this point.  There\'s not a lot here that will 
spoil another GMs game, but just in case, this is your warning.

Here\'s a quick run down on how I got my players involved.  For a more 
detailed notes on what the characters have been through (and how I\'ve 
run the Traveller Adventure), see the post entitled "How I\'m running 
the Traveller Adventure."

The road to the Kafers is a winding one, but stay with me.  You may 
get some good ideas out of this stuff.  What the characters consider 
to be not related often turns out to be related.

This is a political intrigue campaign--filled with instances that 
effect the entire Imperium, although it doesn\'t seem like it at 
first.  I eventually tie in the Kafer with the missing meson guns 
from the first episode of the Traveller Adventure.

The Traveller Adventure:

From the start, I used the TA as the back bone of my campaign, but I 
added to it liberally.  The March Harrier is owned by a dirty 
noble--an ex-mafia type--who is on the run from another "mafia type 
family" in what is called a noble blood fued.  These things can get 
pretty nasty.

This noble, Baron Vaan Praygor, has taken a pseudonym to hide his 
identity and now goes by the name Luke Drake.  He figures that the 
Harrier is the best place for him to be at the moment--hopping from 
planet to planet and not staying in one place too long--until he can 
come up with an idea to strike back at the other noble family and 
rebuild his own.

He\'s put together a crew for the Harrier--one that he thinks will be 
a bit different from your average free trader crew.  His idea is to 
try to make some money in freight and speculative trade, but to also 
hire the ship out as a mercenary vessel.  In running a "mafia type" 
family, he\'s had a lot of experience with this.

Several of the same things happen in my campaign that happen in the 
Traveller Adventure.  The Mammoth crashes to the surface, and it 
is discovered that two Type J meson guns were aboard.  The 
characters, two of them having just musterd out from the Aramis 
Naval base, use their contacts to find out more.  They discover 
that the analysis shows that the meson guns were never aboard the 
ship, and the controversy ensues about how would steal such 
destructive weapons.  Little do my players suspect, at this point, 
they are becoming involved in the events leading up to the Fifth 
Frontier War.

 The crew finds Roet Bannerji\'s wallet, and they are 
approached by a dude named Eneri Giilaan.  In the module, this is a 
minor npc designed to be a red herring.  In my campaign, he\'s a major 
player--one of the guys pulling the crew\'s strings.

The characters become involved in intrigue set against the backdrop 
of the approaching Fifth Frontier War.  Eneri, as far as the 
characters know, is with Naval Intelligence.  He\'s watching Roet 
Bannerji, for a reason not yet determined, when the characters come 
to his attention when they try to return the wallet.

Eneri is also watching Gvoudzon--the vargr with the mysterious 
brooch, and he knows that the the Tukera covert security force, the 
Vemene, is also watching the vargr.

The characters are desperate to get off planet because Praygor\'s 
persuers are right on his heels, but they need a navigator first to 
fill out the crew.  They stumble upon Gvoudzon, a navigator of 
course, being beaten to death by some humans in a dark corner of 
startown.  The vargr agrees to help them get off planet if they will 
help him get back his brooch (which is in the museum--sold by the 
pawn shop where Gvoudzon went as he was desperate for cash), and this 
is the second time that the crew comes to Eneri\'s attention.

Eneri approaches the crew, identifies himself as Naval Intelligence, 
and convinces them to break into the museum and take the brooch.  All 
goes well, that is until they are caught, but Eneri pulls some 
strings with the local authorities and helps them out of the Leedor 
jail and off planet.  The catch is that Eneri cannot get the charges 
dropped (at least, he says he can\'t), and it looks like the 
characters are on the run from the law.  They blast off, with the 
brooch, just ahead of the police cruiser.

At Natoko, they are still faced with the problem of the law catching 
up, but Eneri is prepared for this.  Natoko is an undeveloped world 
wholly owned by Tukera, and the only thing on the planet is a large 
starport and ship construction/maintenance facility.  Eneri\'s got a 
deep cover operative there, Jod Sarkin.  Jod approaches the group and 
directs them to the Communications tower on the base.  It is here 
that he has buried the xboat message from Aramis calling for the 
detention of the Harrier and her crew.  Jod has put the message in a 
"red tape" file, but he can\'t risk his cover to delete it.  If the 
characters want to destroy the message in order to throw of the 
authorities for a while, they are going to have to do it themselves.

This was the adventure on Natoko, and at Patinir, we had a 
non-related adventure (see the short story I wrote on this called 
"Daeus Jacks at OSIRIS Base" on Peter Miller\'s web site).

They get the lead about howood, and following that, they jump into 
the Pysadi system.  When they land, they are surprised as they are 
taken into custody by a detachment of Imperial Marines.

The marines have been sent to extradite the Harrier\'s crew back to 
Aramis.  They caught up with them at Patinir, but leading the mission 
is one of the Harrier\'s crew (Frank) good friends.  Frank Fornne (a 
PC), before he mustered out, was the Sargent Major in charge of 
Support at the Aramis Base.  He served under Captain Chall Sturm, the 
base Marine commander, for 12 years.  Sturm knew Frank too well, and 
if he was involved with running from the law on Aramis, Sturm knew 
that Frank must have a good reason.  Sturm decided, although he got 
flack from the marine squad commander and the system defense boat 
captain (they used a jump shuttle on the SDB), to jump ahead of the 
Harrier and confront them at Pysadi.

But when the Marine detachment got to Pysadi, they were faced with 
the unexpected.  There\'s a high tech manned survey satellite deep 
outsystem in orbit around one of the Pysadian planets.  A comm-torp 
(a communication torpedo used for emergencies when radio 
communications are out) just came within range of Pysadi.  The 
autodrone (as the station is called) was under attack by some unknown 
alien force.

The story behind the autodrone starts with one of the more prominent 
Mother Church converts (Pysadi is ruled by the Mother Church, and all 
Pysadians worship with the cult-like, druidical religion).  This was 
Professor Vlamin Mir.  He was a renown Imperial planetologist who 
made head lines when he converted to the Pysadian religion, resigned 
from his position, changed his name, and travelled to Pysadi to live. 
 
Mir became involved with the Pysadian government, and based on his 
investigations, he proposed a way to improve the Pysadian economic 
condition.  Using his former clout with the Imperium, he was granted 
a TL 15 survey satellite with all the bells and whistles from the 
Imperial Government.  Then, he set about surveying the Pysadi 
planets, looking for a find that could put Pysadi on the map, provide 
an export, and attract commercial concerns.

So, this autodrone is one of the most important things going--to the 
Pysadi government.  When the distress call comes in, it is paramount 
that help is sent.  Pysadi is a poor, low tech world with virtually 
no army or space fleet.  There is no Imperial base here.  The 
visiting Imperial Marines are forced to defend the Imperial citizens 
and abandon their first mission of capturing the Harrier crew.

But, there are only 6 marines--a squad of 4, the Captain, and a 
medic.  There\'s the SDB boat crew, which could double this number, 
but they are not combat personnel.

Captian Sturm, after confering with his old friends among the Harrier 
crew, offers them a solution to their problems.  He\'ll grant them a 
full pardon for their crimes on Aramis if they will bolster the 
marine\'s numbers and help them investigate the disturbance on the 
autodrone.

They all agree, and this brings us to the crew\'s first encounter with 
the Kafers...

It takes them 2.7 days at 6 G\'s aboard the SDB.  The autodrone comes 
into sight, and the sensors pick up hundreds--that\'s right, 
hundreds--of things swarmed around the autodrone.

Closer inspection reveals that they are not moving.  They are bipedal 
aliens in space suits, and they all seem to be dead.  They\'re just 
swarmed around the station--floating there.

The station looks like hell.  It\'s definitely seen some action, but 
still looks intact.  The SDB moves through the cloud of aliens, and 
at this close vantage point, the ship can see that there is nothing 
but slush inside the suits.

Pulling along side the autodrone, the air lock is opened, and the 
crew exits the ship.  Power is minimal on the station, so they hard 
link the power from the SDB to get the outer docking bay door open.  
The place is dark and in zero G.

Inspecting the inside of the docking bay, the Harrier crewmembers 
notice that the Marines\' attention is attracted to something they are 
being told on another comm line.  Then the SDB, snuggled up against 
the mouth of the docking bay, begins to move.

The player characters rush to the lip of the bay to try to get an 
idea of what is going on, and in the distance, they see a large 
object moving toward the station.

It becomes huge--a 40,000 ton ship streaming by the autodrone.  The 
SDB is off at full throttle in an attempt at retreat.  Several 
circular doors open from the hull of the large ship, and hundreds of 
shiney, black, oblong objects are ejected out.  The ship never stops 
its motion, and in a minute, it is off after the SDB.

The black objects slow themselves and swarm around the station.  
Then, explosive bolts blow the objects into two curved, long ways 
halves.  Emerging from within are more of the alien type creatures 
like the dead ones surrounding the station--except these are 
definitely alive and carrying weapons.

Captain Sturm turned to the group and said, "Lock and load!  We\'ve 
got company!"



I literally put the PCs up agains 832 Kafers in this scenario, and 
you know what?  They made it!

All but one of the Marines were killed, Captain Sturm included, but 
the players learned quick to capitalize on the advantage they had 
over the Kafer intelligence and in the autodrone\'s tight enclosure 
and defensive position.

I played the Kafers pretty dumb but ruthless.  They just kept coming. 
 It was like the Aliens movie, but the Kafers were not as smart.

The players barricaded themselves up the elevator shaft on the 
station\'s third floor.  The Kafers, for all thier numbers, couldn\'t 
send more than one or two up the shaft at a time.  The players just 
hung over the side and let it rip with their marine issue gauss 
rifles.  They\'d kill a couple, and this would pose an even worse 
problem for the Kafers--they had obstacles to overcome with the dead 
bodies in the shaft.

But, the players knew that they couldn\'t stay up there forever.  The 
lifesupport on their suits would expire and they would eventually run 
out of ammo--not to mention needing food in a day or so.  And, they 
need to effect repairs on the station to get it moving (the autodrone 
is acutally a cross between a ship and a space station) before the 
Kafer battleship came back.

So they used their noggins.  They took the laser torch from the 
station\'s mechanical tools and cut out pieces from the deck.  With 
these peices, they formed a zero-G tank--and enclosure with a kill 
hole to stick their weapons out.  Since the station was in zero-G, 
the weight of the thing didn\'t matter, and they could push it down 
the shaft protecting themselves.

This kind of thinking helped them secure the station and get the 
majority of the Kafers locked out in space.  They effected repairs 
on the ship, and while doing this, noticed that the Kafers outside 
were dying--the 15 hr. life support on their suits having expired.

I wrote a behind the scenes story between one of the player 
characters and the surviving marine to answer some of the questions 
my players had about the role the Kafers had in the overall story.

You may want to read this story, if you are interested in what I\'ve 
done with the Kafers.  It will elude to many details concerning this 
alien race and their involvement in the upcoming Fifth Frontier War.

The surviving marine\'s name was Lance Sargent Tiko Larrel.  The post 
to look for is called "The Real Tiko".

Check it out.  If anything, it\'s a neat Traveller short story.

In this post, I detail the broad strokes of my campaign.  As 
indicated, I\'m running the Traveller Adventure, so if you are looking 
for ideas for running this great adventure, I\'m sharing my thoughts 
on that here.

WARNING:  TRAVELLER ADVENTURE SPOILERS

I can\'t talk about my Traveller Adventure campaign without giving 
some of the mysterys away from the TA.  If you are playing this right 
now, THEN DON\'T READ THIS.  You GM will thank you.

As I said above, this is the broad overview of how things have gone 
so far in my game.  We\'ve been playing a year, but we are only to 
Pysadi in the module.  If you are familiar with the TA, you\'d 
probably think that we don\'t play that much because Pysadi is not 
that far into the module.  But the truth is that I\'ve added a lot to 
the story.

We had an extensive time on Aramis before we lifted off, and there 
were long adventures on each of the next stops at Natoko, Patinir, 
and Pysadi.

What did I do to change the adventure as written?  Plenty.  Read on.

Check out the Using Kafer post for more info on how I laid out this 
campaign, and see the Tiko short story for more plot twists and 
turns.

Enjoy!

PRELUDES...

1093
Tureded, home of the great Houses, is racked with conflict.  House
Jade, a long time rival of Tureded\'s premier House--House Praygor,
merges with House London to form the largest Family the planet has
ever seen.

In an effort to establish their new position of power, the new House
Jade-London begins an all out strike against their closest competitor.
 When the dust clears, House Praygor has lost many of its top
officials--among them Vaan\'s uncle.  A Blood War, the worst type of
clash between noble Houses, begins.

Baron Marq, Vaan\'s father and head of House Praygor, sends Vaan away
to serve on one of the Family\'s smuggling ships in an effort to begin
Vaan\'s tutelage for the position he must eventually take in the
Family\'s leadership, but Vaan is sure that the larger reasoning behind
this decision is his protection from the Jade-Londonists and the Blood
War.

In the next 20 months, Vaan learns the ins and outs of running a
starship and gains experience as a starship engineer.  

He also begins to collect things from the many ports he visits during
his travels, and this collection will eventually grow in size to over
42 tons with incalculable value.



1096
Having graduated to learning the ropes of the core Family business
based from the Tureded starport, Vaan sends word that he will not be
returning to space and orders that his collection be shipped to him at
his homeworld.

In acknowledgment of this, the smuggling ship, unable to return itself
due to its schedule, sends the collection back to Tureded as general
cargo on a free trader in sealed, unmarked containers.  

The ship they choose is the March Harrier, and the cargo never
arrives.



1097
All of Vaan\'s efforts to locate the cargo have been futile, even with
the considerable resources of House Praygor.  The official story is
that his cargo was lost in an attack when the Harrier was hit by
pirates, but Vaan doesn\'t believe this--after all, it is his line of
work.  He knows that he would have found something in the intervening
eight months if a pirate group had taken it, so his attention has been
concentrated on one man--the Harrier\'s lone survivor, Shawn Grey.

Discovering that the Harrier has been dry docked in one of Aramis\'
long term hangar facilities, Vaan has relegates himself to waiting for
the ship\'s new owner to return from duty in the Imperial Army four
years down the road.  

Vaan adds up the clues to his missing fortune:  a dry-docked ship, one
survivor, a new owner, and the survivor\'s sudden, albeit unlikely,
enlistment in the Army at age 33.  All of these clues lead back to one
person--again, Shawn Grey.

Vaan didn\'t need it any clearer.  The authorities may be fooled, but
Vaan could read a book written this clearly.  He hires an agent on
Aramis to keep an eye on the dry docked ship.  When the owner returns
to collect his prize, Vaan will be informed.



1104
Fast forward seven years.  The Blood War has taken its toll on House
Praygor, and Vaan, now a Baron at the death of his father, is faced
with questions of survival for his House.

The Jade-Londonists have been ruthless.  House Praygor is all but
decimated.  Mass defections from Praygor to Jade-London have occurred,
and those who were too loyal to go were executed.  Baron Vaan knows
that his own death is just a matter of time.  Desperate, he is out of
options.

Then a nightmare from his past surfaces as today\'s savior--his only
chance.  An agent on Aramis, one he had forgotten about long ago,
sends word that Shawn Grey has returned and is outfitting the March
Harrier for its return to space.

It is the exact bit of luck that Vaan needs.  That night, he leaves
for Aramis.  

And he knows that in spite of the precautions he has taken, the
Jade-Londonists will not be far behind.




1105

EPISODE I:  ARAMIS
Immediately Vaan locates the Harrier and discovers that the vessel is
subsidized by Oberlindes Lines.  With the subsidy agent right here on
Aramis, the task is easy.  To Vaan\'s surprise, the agent, Ulric
Harrisani, is more than helpful--he becomes Vaan\'s partner.  

A check with the authorities confirms that they still suspect Grey for
the capital murder of the Harrier\'s crew eight years ago, but they
have dropped the case due to lack of evidence.  Vaan provides them
with some, and Grey is arrested.

Harrisani helps Vaan obtain licenses under his pseudonym, Luke Drake,
and the two take possession of the Harrier as it\'s third set of
owners.  Grey had been busy putting together a crew for the ship, and,
since they had no loyalty to Grey whom they had just met, it is an
easy job for Praygor to convince them to stay aboard.  Most of them
are happy that they still had the job they thought they had.  Some of
them had come a long distance to serve aboard the Harrier.

This gave Praygor almost a whole ship compliment.  Frank Fornne, and
ex-marine, would take up station as the ship\'s gunner.  His friend,
Too Neimerani, stayed on as the ship\'s doctor.  Then there was Glynn
Connal, officially the ship\'s steward, he also had connections and
knew his way around a startown district.  Praygor knew he could use
him in more ways than one.

Daeus Jacks, and ex-naval officer, would continue as the ship\'s pilot.
 These four individuals, plus Ulric acting as the ship\'s
administrative officer, would give Vaan just about all the crew he
would need to get started.  Although he would of liked to have another
gunner for the ship\'s second weapon--especially with the threat of a
run in with the Jade-Londonists, all he really needed at this time was
a navigator.  Praygor, himself, would fall back on the training he had
as a kid and be the ship\'s engineer.

Ulric makes a few calls to the local starport looking for a lead on a
navigator.  Praygor keeps busy overseeing the refitting of the
ship--being in dry dock for eight years can increase the chance of
unexpected problems.  You didn\'t want unexpected problems like that
when you were in space.

With the men that Ulric had dug up, Praygor scheduled interviews for
the next day.  Today being the New Year, most of the applicants would
be hung over for their bright and early interview the next morning. 
He needed men he could count on, and this seemed the first step in the
weeding process.

6:00 AM, local time, the next morning, Praygor and crew wait at the
Happy Spacer at the edge of startown for the interviewees Ulric had
set up.  Three applicants are no-shows, and Praygor wonders if the
choice of setting makes the applicants think the job is not worth
while.  But, that can\'t be.  Plenty of free-traders like himself do
business in a bar.  Besides, this was the only place Praygor could
find in which to conduct his business.  Most other establishments will
not open until 8:00 AM.  The Happy Spacer is open because it never
closed.

Looking up to greet the man moving towards him, Vaan thinks that one
has finally shown up but quickly realizes that it is Shawn Grey.

Praygor thinks he is dead, unable to react in time.  Shawn Grey has
come to exact his revenge on Vaan for stealing his ship.  But just as
soon as that thought races through his mind, Vaan is surprised again
as men in cloaks step up, in unison, from the varied tables in the
bar, catch Grey in some sort of lasso, and begin to stab him to death.

Hmm.  Praygor and the authorities are not the only enemies that his
man has.

The ship is ready in a week or so, but that week turns out to be much
more than business as usual--strange days, indeed.  (This is about
where we started the game.  Since we\'ve played this, I\'ll just refresh
your memory instead of writing the whole thing down in prose.)

A run down of events...

*    Grey\'s attackers, the Kai-lek as they are called, turn their
attention towards Praygor and the crew.  When it is understood that
Grey had stolen a religious artifact from then, a golden urn, Vaan
arranges for its return to handle the situation.

*    Too finds a card for Urkinu Gamenga in Shawn\'s pocket while he is
treating him.  It is guessed that this is Shawn\'s fence as he has an
antiques shop in town and is known as a rare item broker.

*    A ship bearing two meson guns plows into the Aramis surface after
its fall from orbit.  A massive investigation follows coordinating the
efforts of the Imperial Navy, the Imperial Marines, the Leedor
Starport Authority, Akerut Lines (owner of the ship), Tukera Lines
(owner of Akerut), and the Aramis government.

*    Jelika Chan, chief engineer of the Mammoth (the ship that went
down), is under investigation for incompetence.  Currently, she is
being treated for wounds sustained in the crash at the Leedor
Hospital--the same place Shawn Grey was taken after his attack.

*    From the city news monitors, it is clear that the relations between
the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate are deteriorating.  This is big
news in the Spinward Marches because the last four Frontier Wars,
conflicts between the two governments, have been fought in this
sector.

*    Glynn finds a wallet in the Leedor startown district.  Upon
returning the wallet to the captain of a ship in port at the starport,
the captain invites Glynn to dine with him at the TAS.  But, as Glynn
arrives, he finds out that this captain, Roet Bannerji, left port
within a few hours of talking to him.

*    Outside the Happy Spacer, the crew happens upon a beaten vargr. 
Nearly beaten to 
 death, Too provides medical care.  As it turns out, this vargr is
 also a navigator.  Increasingly wary of the threat the Jade-Londonist
 pose, Praygor decides to hire him short term just to get them off
 planet.

 But this vargr comes with a price.  He is being followed.  He has
 noticed men watching both his workplace and apartment.  He is sure
 that they are after the brooch, of that he is sure because they just
 beat him for it.

 Gvoudzon, the vargr, will gladly join the crew and leave planet.  It
 is in his best interest too, but he first needs to retrieve the
 brooch from the museum.  The guy at the pawn shop told him that\'s who
 he sold it to.  

 If Praygor will agree to help him get his brooch back, Gvoudzon will
 agree to join the ship and help them get off planet.

 Faced with little and no choice, if he wants to leave Aramis ahead of
 the Jade-Londonists, Praygor agrees.

*    Vaan uses Glynn\'s contacts to have Shawn Grey killed.  A call to the
hospital confirms that Shawn "is no longer a patient of the hospital."

*    Frank is approached by Eneri Giilaan, a man revealing himself to be
with Naval Intelligence.  
 He asks questions concerning Roet Bannerji and Gvoudzon\'s brooch, and
 when Frank tells him of the planned break-in at the Leedor museum, he
 approves and provides support.

*    Glynn contacts Rutger Bloch, an arms dealer he has done business
with before here on Aramis.  Rutger sends an agent of his, Majhara
Kristen, to see the group\'s needs.  

 Frank later finds out that Eneri Giilaan used Rutger for the
 equipment Eneri offered for 
assistance in the break in.  

*    The crew attempts the break in, but Frank and Ulric are caught. 
Eneri is able to have the 
 charges against Frank dropped but does not have the pull to free
 Ulric as well.  He pulls a favor from the Leedor Police Department,
 but it looks like Ulric has run.  

*    As Eneri delivers Ulric to the starport hotel, Daeus tries for
clearance to lift off.  But the 
 answer comes back negative due to the incidents at the museum and
 police station.  It is a race to lift off before the authorities
 arrive.

 Eneri helps out again with a bribe to the starport controller.  The
 Harrier lifts off and enters jump before the authorities can catch
 up. 



EPISODE II:  NATOKO 
*    The jump into Natoko is uneventful, if you can call Glynn
threatening to destroy the ship by detaching the launch and sending it
through the field bubble while in jump uneventful.  

 Yes, command is turning out to be much more than Praygor had
 anticipated.  It is one thing 
to run an organization like he had done back on Tureded, and it is
totally another to deal with the intimate details involved with
running a starship.

 But, they got off Aramis with their skins one step ahead of the law
 so things are not that bad 
after all.

*    Planetside, in the Tukera facility, an effort is made to contact
Gyles Honsen.  Ulric pulled the name out of the ship\'s library
computer.  Honsen was the broker that used to service the ship way
back when it was owned by the vargr.  Praygor hoped that Honsen would
be easy to deal with based on that prior relationship.

*    Gyles Honsen, on the other hand, felt no ties to the current Harrier
crew at all.  In fact, he was a long time associate of the ship\'s
previous owners, though he wouldn\'t go so far as to call them friends,
but that didn\'t stop him from being angry about their murders.

 As far as Gyles is concerned, he could care less if the new owners
 ever got a cargo, and 
when Praygor and company came calling, he tells them that.

*    Back to square one, the crews begins a search for another broker to
help them.  Normally, Ulric, whose suite a skilled broker, would take
care of the ship\'s needs.  But because of the trouble that was started
back on Aramis, Praygor decides to keep a low profile.  A casual ship
listing on the starport comm-net just wouldn\'t do.  The captain wanted
to put some distance between himself and the authorities--and the Jade
Londonists.  The goal here was to leave as little a trail as possible.
 When the Aramis police or the Jade Londonists tracked them here,
Praygor wasn\'t going to make it easy for them to pick up the trail
again.

*    Glynn finds another broker, or rather the broker found him, in one
of the starport bars.  Ulrich Baseru is a rival of Honsen\'s, and he
keeps tabs on his business.  Ulrich is a relative newcomer to Natoko,
trying to establish himself, and any of the fish that Honsen throws
back into the sea, Baseru catches.  The Harrier crew is one of these
catches.

 And Ulrich had done his homework.  He knew the Harrier was a jump-1
 vessel, stranding it in 
the Aramis Trace.  Any free trader captain in his right mind would
give his eye-teeth to obtain  a way out of the Trace and into new
markets.  Even if the ship was held to the Trace due to it\'s subsidy
agreement, which Ulrich knew the Harrier was (a little piece of
information that he had found out from the investigation of his
rival), there are always clauses in those agreements allowing the ship
to leave its subsidy route for some specified length of time.  

 Baseru had an answer to this problem--one that is less expensive than
 purchasing a new set 
of drop tanks or upgrading the jump drive.

 When Ulrich first bought his brokership, he inherited some equipment
 from the previous 
owner.  This was odds and ends mostly, but one piece of this equipment
suited the needs of the Harrier\'s crew perfectly--used demountable
drop tanks.  Since they hadn\'t cost Ulrich anything, all he needed to
cover was the storage fees he had incurred over the last year.

 The broker figured that this might be enough incentive to persuade
 the ship to take a cargo 
out of the Trace and into the Scatters to Patinir.  Normally, this
wouldn\'t have been a big deal, but with Natoko\'s primary industry
being starship repair, the planet attracted a lot of large starships. 
Very few free traders called here, and the larger ships could rarely
be persuaded to leave the primary trade routes.  It just wasn\'t
profitable to do so.

 The Harrier was exactly what he needed to get a consignment of cargo
 to his partner in the 
Patinir Belt.  It was a perfect opportunity that fell into his lap,
and he wanted to make the pot sweet enough so that the Harrier\'s
captain would take the deal.

 Baseru couldn\'t have known that the deal was exactly what Praygor
 needed.

*    Praygor OK\'s the deal, and the crew sets to work installing the
tanks.  The starport has a week long back log before they can get
started, and he is confident that he, along with the others, can
install the tanks themselves.

 The deal involves taking some mining supplies to Baseru\'s contact in
 the Patinir Belt.  No 
problem there--straight freight run.  Baseru also introduces Praygor
to a client of his looking for a ship.  Her name is Andrea Rygoff,
working for OSIRIS Mining Corporation.  She\'s chaperoning a cold sleep
module with the family members of OSIRIS\'s deep belt facility at
Patinir.

 Praygor is a little skeptical at first, but he agrees to take the
 module.  They might as well 
make a little money on the trip.

*    As the installation of the tanks proceeds, a Tukera communications
officer contacts the ship.  He identifies himself as Jod Sarkin, an
agent of Eneri Giilaan.  He says that the message from the authorities
on Aramis ordering Tukera Security to detain the ship has already
arrived.  Evidently, the Aramis people knew where the ship was headed,
but that was not hard to find out.  The Harrier had been posted to
this destination with the freight they picked up on Aramis.  Praygor
was actually surprised that they weren\'t already here on Natoko
waiting for them.  

 Jod says that a message arrived from Eneri by Xboat just before the
 Harrier arrived.  Gillaan 
had ordered Jod to help the ship and crew to get off planet before
they were detained.  Installing these jump tanks complicated matters. 
Sarkin had been able to suppress the message in the red tape of the
communication system in the base operations center, but it was a
priority message.  At any time, it could be discovered.

 Jod\'s original plan was to suppress the message long enough for the
 ship to lift off, but a 
week was just too long.  He could suppress it for only so long before
he jeopardized his cover.  Knowing this, he dumped the message into
what he called no man\'s land--a special glitch he had set up in the
base comm computer.

 It made sense for the Harrier to obtain the tanks.  If they could
 conceal their next destination, 
it would buy them some time in the run from the authorities.  The
Aramis officials would not think to look outside the Aramis Trace at
first.  They\'d go to Reacher, the next planet within the Harrier\'s
range.  The tanks wouldn\'t buy them much time, but they would buy them
some.

 If time to install the tanks was to be taken, then something would
 have to be done about the 
message.  Jod would help them, but he had to be careful not to blow
his cover.  He\'d give them the equipment they needed to find and
destroy the message, but Praygor and his crew would be on their own. 
If they got caught, Jod couldn\'t help them.

*    What Sarkin had said made sense to the Captain.  Praygor assembled a
team, put Frank in charge, and sent them to delete the message.  Jod
provided high tech, top secret, Imperial  computer equipment to get
the job done.  All they had to do was infiltrate the Tukera Ops
Center, find a link to the comm computer, and let the machine do its
thing.

 Easier said than done.

*    The job went off with out a hitch.  Well, almost without a hitch.  A
few guard were killed, but so what, they were Tukera.  Frank froze up
on killing some innocents, but Jod stepped in at the last moment and
finished the job like the professional he was.

 It was much cleaner than the Aramis museum thing--mainly because they
 got away with it.

*    With Baseru\'s cargo loaded, the tanks installed, and Rygoff and her
cold berth unit aboard, the Harrier received clearance and lifted off
for Patinir.

 Just as they approached jump point, a message came in from the
 planet.  Frank asks 
Praygor to turn the ship around.

 Why?  Frank\'s friend, Gyr Lurkhurdaadaagige, arrived from Aramis and
 just missed the 
Harrier\'s lift off by a few hours.  

 Gyr had been in the Corps with Frank, and was in charge of the recon
 party that first 
investigated the crash of the Mammoth.  Just in the last two weeks,
Gyr had been mustered out of the service four months early.

 There was something strange about that.  Nobody got out of the
 Imperial Marine Corps early.  
Gyr knew that there was something strange going on too, and since he
has spoken to his best friend about it before Frank left with the
Harrier back on Aramis, he came looking for Frank to sort things out. 
Frank had told Gyr about Eneri Giilaan, and, well, here he was.

 Besides, Sandy was a good turret gunner.  From what they had been
 through so far, Praygor 
knew that a second gunner would be needed.  He ordered the launch back
to the planet to pick up the ex-Marine.

 Praygor thought his story would be interesting.



 EPISODE III:  PATINIR 
*    Two weeks later, the ship calls at OSIRIS base to drop off Rygoff
and her very cold passengers.  Again, there was no word from the
Aramis authorities, but during the jump, Rygoff gave Praygor a scare. 
She said that the cold passengers were put into their units by London
Mining.  Vaan knew that London Mining was one of the corporations
owned by the Jade-London Family.

 Was it coincidence?  Or was is something else?

*    It wasn\'t long before Praygor knew the answer.  Automatic weapon
fire ripped from the cargo hold were Too was helping the station
doctor bring the passengers out of cold sleep.

 Within minutes, the androids had swept over the base.  Half his crew
 on the other side of the 
base, there wasn\'t much Vaan could do.

*    Forty five minutes later, the Harrier was lifting off from the base
as it exploded.  Daeus had made it in from the other side of the base
to pilot the ship, but he didn\'t know the fate of the others.  Ulric,
Glynn, and Sandy were still missing.

 As the reactors in the base blew, Gvoudzon established contact with
 the OSIRIS escape 
pod.  All three crew members were alive along with one base survivor,
Shuul Vicker.

*    Praygor contacts the local OSIRIS manager, Katherine Martin, and
tows the escape pod with them to one of Patinir\'s two belt colonies,
Joyston Colony.

 Although the relationship between Katherine and the Captain is
 strained, she offers to repair 
the damage done to the Harrier and reward the ship\'s crew for saving
two of the OSIRIS workers.  She tells them of the rivalry between her
company and London Mining and how this rivalry has escalated lately
due to the government price ceiling placed on Lanthanum.

*    This subject is heard again when the Harrier drops off it\'s cargo to
Ghan Siverns, Ulrich Baseru\'s counterpart here in the Patinir Belt. 
Ghan tells them that, due to the escalated tensions with the Zhodani,
the Navy lobbied for and was granted Imperial price ceilings placed on
Lanthanum and a few other precious metals.  

 Praygor already knew Lanthanum\'s worth.  It was one of the few metals
 used to construct the 
starship jump grids and the inner coils of jump drives.  It made
sense, that if the Navy was to build more ships in an arms race with
the Zhodani, the price of this metal was controlled by the government.
 Cheaper material meant more ships.

 But this didn\'t sit well with mining colonies like the ones in the
 Patinir Belt.  The price ceiling 
meant that the price was set artificially low.  With Lanthanum being
the primary export from the Patinir system, this had done a number on
the local economics.

 This would be find, Ghan told them, if everybody played by the same
 rules, but this was not 
the case.  Being close to the border with the Vargr Extents, the vargr
had increased merchant traffic lately into the subsector after the
recent diplomatic overtures made by the Marquis of Aramis.

 The Marquis had established several vargr trading stations on planets
 throughout the 
subsector designed to promote trade with the Imperium\'s hairy brothers
coreward.  All in all, this was working in most areas of the
subsector, but it actually hurt trade in the Patinir system.  

 The problem had to do, again, with Lanthanum.  The Lanthanum mined
 here at Patinir had a 
price ceiling--not encouraging to trade.  Processing has slowed and
prospecting has all but stopped.

 The Vargr Extents, on the other hand, has no such provision, and due
 to the recent trade 
agreements made with certain worlds within the Vargr territories,
Imperial law does not regulate imported Lanthanum.  

 Just over the border lays Scangen, home to one of the biggest
 Lanthanum mines ever 
created.  Vargr traders venture into the Imperium with loads of
Lanthanum, and due to the decreased production of Imperial Lanthanum,
receive higher prices for their imported ore.

 The Navy\'s plan has backfired in this section of space due to the law
 and Vargr imports.  The 
local bases and Naval ship construction facilities can\'t get enough
Lanthanum for ship production, and the Navy is paying the higher price
anyway.

 This has gone on for two years now, but Ghan informs the crew that
 the local mining 
companies have banded together to lobby to get the price ceiling
removed.  They haven\'t been successful because the law is
Imperium-wide, and the vargr trade issue is not an issue in other
parts of the Imperium.

 The Imperium is a very large place, and galactic politics can be
 brutal.  A direct result of that 
brutality is the recent aggressiveness between mining companies.  What
the Harrier\'s crew stumbled upon at the OSIRIS base was an extreme
case of this increased aggressiveness.

*    Ghan promised to look for additional cargoes and passengers, and
Ulric told him the direction that they wanted to go--away from the
Aramis Trace, deeper into the Scatters.

 In the mean time, Ghan had needed supplies shipped out to a few
 supply stations in the belt.  
Normally, Ghan had a shuttle delivering these supplies, but it had not
returned from its last trip yet and was three days behind schedule. 
Since the trip took about a week to complete, Ghan wanted to know if
the Harrier was available to take these supplies in-system for him. 
Siverns would pay them what he pays the shuttle pilots, and in return
for them helping him in this jam, he would wave his fee for any
cargoes or passengers he might locate for them.

 It seemed a good deal, and the Harrier was off on its run.

*    The three stops done, the ship came across a distress signal, and
upon investigation, the missing shuttle.  Daeus went across to
investigate and found the pilot barely alive.  He was dying from
radiation poisoning, and the ship\'s sensors reported that the shuttle
had been hit by tight zone nuclear missile.

 Later aboard the Harrier, Too tried to save the pilot, but it was too
 late.  The pilot had been 
exposed for too long.

 He did manage to say one interesting word, though--Wolblutn.  The
 Wolblutn was Captain 
Bannerji\'s ship--the one that had lifted off just hours after Glynn
had returned Bannerji\'s wallet back on Aramis, the same Wolblutn that
Eneri Giilaan was interested in.

*    Calling Ghan Siverns on the tight beam, Siverns instructed them to
take the pilot\'s body to Palantir, a planet just outsystem from the
belt.  There, he had also located passengers and cargo for the
Harrier\'s next jump.

 At Palantir, Dev Landrel, a weird scientific type was picked up,
 along with the president of a 
local entertainment company, his wife, two films they had just
completed, the films\' director, and a vargr investor.

 All were headed for Aramanx, while the freight was to be shipped to
 Pysadi.  Ghan had 
informed them of a speculative tip about the price of howood on
Aramanx, and Pysadi was one of the few planets in the subsector where
the wood could be found.

 Ghan turned out to know his stuff.  He\'d let them in on the howood,
 gave them work, found a 
cargo headed for the direction they wanted to go, and informed them
about the Lanthanum price ceiling in case they thought of speculating
on the ore.  Unless they got it from the Vargr Extents,  that was not
a good idea.

*    With the stop in the Patinir Belt, the ship is able, for the first
time, to take on some semblance of a regular free trading vessel. 
Jumping out farther into the Scatters, to Pysadi, Praygor is confident
that he is putting some distance between the ship, the
Jade-Londonists, and the Aramis authorities.  This will make the
second jump the Harrier has made taking precautions to minimize the
tracks she leaves.  Ghan Siverns, without knowing it, is instrumental
in keeping the ship off the regular merchant comm-banks.

 Normalcy entering their lives for the first time aboard this ship,
 Gvoudzon begins a routine of 
downloading files from the central news agency into the Harrier\'s
Library banks.

*    Since the Harrier\'s subsidy is granted through Oberlindes Lines,
Praygor makes note of the company\'s name popping up in recent news. 
Its large warship, the Emissary, is attacked by vargr corsairs during
operations in the Vargr Extents.  What\'s interesting is that the ship
was purchased surplus from the Imperial Navy with its weapon systems
intact!  

 Although Oberlindes has boasted that the weapons have never been
 fired--that just the 
threat of such a warship is deterrent enough to corsair bands who look
to less defended prizes, the ship is equipped with a spinal mount
weapon.

 With the recent disappearance of the two meson guns from Aramis,
 Praygor knows that he 
can\'t have been the only one to make a connection.

*    One of the big stories is about Akidda Laagiir, a senior editor for
the Mora World Review, who has won the prestigious Traveller\'s Digest
Touring Award, akin to Terra\'s Nobel Prize for news reporting. 
Laagiir won the prize on the merits of his recent series of
investigative reports into the tensions between the Zhodani Consulate
and the Imperium.  Some have hailed him a doomsayer because of his
negative views of the situation and prediction of another Frontier
War.

*    There are two patients missing from the Leedor Hospital on Aramis. 
One has made big news, as it was Jelika Chan, the engineer charged
with incompetence in the crash of the Mammoth.

 The second is a side note in the story, but of more importance to
 Praygor.  Shawn Grey is 
missing from his hospital bed as well.  Although this could be a
natural result of the hit Praygor placed on Grey before the Harrier
left Aramis, Vaan noticed that the dates didn\'t match up.







EPISODE IV:  PYSADI
*    Pysadi, what a rock, Praygor thought--tainted atmosphere, technology
so low that they\'re still pulling carts around with oxygen, and a
tyrannical government run by the Church.  It would take a religious
fanatic to want to live here.

 As they taxied into the decrepit starport, the most modern structure
 on the planet, Daeus 
look over his shoulder as Praygor was peering out the bow ports.

 The Captain was pointing at three Pysadians, crawling around the port
 in their filter masks 
and cold weather clothing.  "I\'m glad I\'m not you.  I\'m glad I\'m not
you, and I\'m glad I\'m not you."

*    While the cargo was being unloaded, both Frank and Gvoudzon managed
to get themselves into trouble.

 Gvoudzon matched chests with the crew of a vargr trading ship in
 port.  To Praygor\'s 
surprise, Gvoudzon managed to come out on top, and because he won, the
other vargr\'s respected him.  The Captain never would understand vargr
psychology.

 Frank, on the other hand, decided to pick a fight with the entire
 crew of the Tukera vessel in 
port.  This thing almost turned into the biggest incident Pysadi had
ever seen.  You should have seen their faces.

*    Captain Chall Sturm, the Marine base commander on Aramis, came out
with his marine detachment to detain the Harrier\'s crew members. 
Praygor wasn\'t as far ahead of the authorities as he thought.

 Sturm had picked up the ship a couple of weeks ago in the Patinir
 system.  Since Sturm had 
worked with both Frank and Sandy for the better part of 12 years, he
had a good idea that they wouldn\'t just go back into the Aramis Trace
when they left Natoko.  He knew they\'d find a way to loose themselves
out into the Scatters.  

 Besides, Sturm had a tip.  Jod Sarkin informed Eneri Giilaan which
 way the Harrier had 
gone.  This was communicated to the Marine detachment assigned to
Sturm, who then, without telling Sturm where the information came
from, pushed for the pursuit in the direction of Patinir.

 Sure enough, when they reached Patinir, it was not hard to pick up
 the trail of the Harrier.  
They were all over the local news due to the incident at OSIRIS base.

 Chall could have picked them up there in the belt, but he decided to
 wait.  He knew Frank 
and Sandy well--even called them friends.  They wouldn\'t be mixed up
in some petty museum break in if it wasn\'t important to do so.

*    But, as Chall and company set up to trap the Harrier, they got a
surprise.  A distress call came in from the orbital research facility
outsystem from Pysadi.  Since this was the hope of Pysadi\'s future,
and the system had no real defenses of its own, it was up to Chall to
take his Marines out to the location and save the day.

*    Having interviewed Frank, Sandy, and the rest of the Harrier crew,
Sturm pieced together what was happening.  Talking with Frank and
Sandy alone, the emergency situation with the research lab posed a
unique opportunity to get them out of this mess.  If the crew would
agree to help Sturm and his four man marine squad investigate the
problem on the lab, Sturm would exercise his Imperial command
authority and give them an official pardon for the marginal crimes
committed on Aramis.

 The distress message described attacking alien lifeforms.  Sturm had
 himself, his doctor, the 
four man marine squad, and the five man crew of the gunboat.  The
message reported thousands of aliens.

 Three members of the Harrier crew were recent retirees from the
 military base at Aramis, 
and Sturm had worked closely with two of them.  It only made sense to
supplement their numbers with any who were willing to participate from
the Harrier.

*    To a man, Praygor and the rest of his crew agreed to help Sturm. 
The autolab was Pysadi\'s hope of the future.  A TL 15 piece of
equipment, the drone was constructed to survey the planets in the
Pysadian system, searching for minerals to exploit.  

*    Pysadi needed an export to encourage trade into the system.  A
recent convert to the Pysadian religion, Professor Vlamin Mir had been
a planetologist of some renown in the Imperium.  In fact, he had been
knighted for his work.

*    It was a shock to the scientific community when Mir announced his
conversion, changed his name, and moved to Pysadi.  A year and a half
ago, he petitioned the Imperial government, on behalf of Pysadi, for
the autodrone.  He had already made some observations from his lab on
Pysadi, and if his assumptions were correct, at least one of the
system\'s bodies contained Lanthanum.

 Mir wanted to boost Pysadi\'s economy by capitalizing on this
 discovery.  The Imperium 
wanted the Lanthanum for the Navy.  Both agreed, and the autodrone was
sent.

*    From the news files obtained at Pysadi, Praygor noticed that the
Count he owed fealty to by right of his title of Baron, Count Knowln
of Celepina in the Rhylanor subsector, had a recent assassination
attempt made on his life.

*    There was also a story about a kidnapped little girl, from Aramis,
found on Zila.  It was your regular news story except for one of the
names that Praygor recognized.

*    Aramanx, the ship\'s ultimate destination for both passengers and
howood cargo, also popped up.  Aramanx has been called the "powder keg
of the Towers Cluster", and this report of more hostilities between
the nations of Aramanx told Praygor that the politics were not getting
any calmer on that planet.

*    On the other side of the sector, there was a report of Imperial
Marines skirmishing with the TFL, a terrorist organization based on
Garda-Villis.

*    Breathtaking news came in the form of the technological advancement
General Shipyards has made with L-Hyd drop tanks for use with high
capacity commercial shipping.  This advancement promises to increase
the range of large freighters.  Tukera signed a deal with General to
upgrade its fleet of large freighters, while Oberlindes Lines,
comprised mostly of smaller vessels, had their stock drop 27 points in
one day on the heels of this announcement.

 The Imperial Scout Service issued a statement complimenting General
 for its innovation and 
signed a deal with them for the manufacture of L-Hyd drop tanks for
the Xboat system.  The IISS claims that this innovation will increase
the average jump time to Jump-5.5 across the Imperium.  This would do
wonders for communication, both official, commercial, and private.  A
program is to be implemented that promises to have the new jump
network operational in this sector of space within the next 10 years.

*    And, with the recent report of the vargr attack against the
Oberlindes ship, Emissary, Praygor spots another entry detailing
increased corsair activity.  This time, the attack point lies within
Imperial space, not too far from Pysadi, at Focaline.



And this brings us to the recent short story I wrote--The Real Tiko.  
That will clear up some of the mysteries surrounding the aliens and 
the autodrone.

Also check out the Using Kafers post-- this has some info in it about 
how I integrated the Kafers in the overall story.

- - The Templars should operate sort of like a TL15 Lone Ranger, but not
_entirely_ lily-white either.  Finding them should not be easy, as you\'d
have to go through any number of false corporate fronts, administrative
people, etc., just to get an audience with someone who might be able to
discreetly pass on your information.  Oh, and they make no guarantees, but
get their expensive payment up-front, just for considering your situation.
OTOH, gaining the notice of the Templars should be very easy, if you do the
right (wrong :) ) things.  The PCs should live in dread of seeing a Templar
cruiser appear on their screens unless they\'ve been very, very good.

- - Officially, the Imperial government puts the Templars down as a rumor
based on overactive imaginations.  Very quietly they will admit that they
exist, but are no more than a minor nuisance.  _Very_ unofficially, the
highest levels of the Imperial government have been known to work closely
with the Templar leadership on especially thorny problems where the
Imperial Sun might not be a welcome sight.  The Templars are not precisely
mercenaries, but if Imperial goals and their own intersect, why should they
not act?  And since so many (all?) of the Templars are of noble birth,
their aims and the Imperial Aristocracy\'s are not often far apart.  Oh, and
Templars love nothing quite so much as teaching some young braggart Noble a
clear lesson about the way the Universe _really_ works.  

- - I\'d say that rather than giving the Templars cushy bases on only the best
planets (though I\'d guess they have a couple of those :) ), that their main
bases should be on very-low albedo hardened asteroids, often in otherwise
deserted systems -- maybe one or two are on moons orbiting worlds with TL0
natives on them, thus giving rise to the Protector semi-myth?

>Internal Politics: Two or three different factions. The purest who truly

And of course there are rumors, difficult to pin down even in the halls of
the Templar Citadels, that some among them are deeply placed Zhodani spies,
while others are said to have dark designs on the Iridium Throne itself...

Oooh, I like this. :)

The Real Tiko      

by Kenneth D. Bearden

 

Frank jammed his foot up against the reactor housing to get some
leverage.  That damn access plate just wouldn\'t come off.  With a
tight grip on the handle of the multi-tool, he pushed with his leg,
straining to get the nut to turn.

Wham!  The multi-tool slipped, flew into the air, and popped into
Frank\'s forehead.

"Shit!"  Rubbing his forehead, he checked for blood.  Yep, sure
enough.  The damn thing had broken skin.  "You\'re about to piss me
off, you fuckin\' thing." 

The blood from his wound started to flow more evenly, and this was all
he could stand.  Using all his might, he kicked the reactor as hard as
he could.  Pain shot up his leg, and he was sure he had, on top of
everything else he had been through in the last 24 hours, bruised his
heel.  

"FUCK!"

Laughter erupted from the open hatch that led up to the command deck. 
Tiko had stopped his decent into the room, and he clung there, frozen
on the ladder by the involuntary belly laugh.  "What\'d you think you
would do, punch a hole through half a meter of shielding with your
foot?"

Frank peered at the marine over the top of the reactor.  "Laugh,
laugh, laugh.  Ha, ha."

Tiko couldn\'t take it, and one arm slipped to hold his gut.  He looked
weak--like the contractions from his laugh would make him fall.  In
between gaps of breath, he said, "You\'re...you\'re like the Kafers! 
That\'s how they thought they were going to get in here too!"  He
bounced up and down on the ladder, using his legs to swing with the
laugh.

Frank put on his best blank face.  "I\'m glad you are having so much
fun at my expense."

Tiko howled.  "I\'ve got to get down before you make me fall."  Sliding
to the deck, he popped his thumb towards the hatch in the ceiling. 
Innocent, he said, "So, you want me to go get Too to treat your
wound?"

Frank\'s blank face turned to a smirk, and he prodded his forehead with
his finger.  "Laugh it up, marine.  Ya know if I was still in command
back on Aramis, you wouldn\'t think this is that funny."

Tiko\'s large smile tightened, but he couldn\'t help but grin.  It
struck Frank as strange, like Tiko\'s whole mood had just now abruptly
swung.  Searching the marine\'s features, the playful face was still
there, but Frank could sense that something was different.

"I wouldn\'t be under your command we were still on Aramis."  Tiko\'s
tone was a little more serious than it had been before.

Frank played it off.  "Well, you know what I mean--me being your
superior in rank and all.  You know--me E-9 you E-4."

Tiko gave an agreeing motion with his head and looked down.  He didn\'t
say anything in response.  The conversation was dying.  There was
definitely something up.

Frank, bewildered and uncomfortable with the silence that just fell,
tried to recover with a question.  "...but, since I\'m not a sergeant
major anymore, you out rank me, don\'t you lance sergeant?"

Tiko looked up from his feet.  His tone was serious.  "That would be
true if I were a lance sergeant."

"What do you mean?"  

"Just what I said.  Like you, I once was a marine, but no longer and
not for a while."

Frank just stared.  He couldn\'t think of anything to say, nor could he
figure Tiko\'s angle.

Tiko picked up on the cue, and politely, he continued.  "I really
don\'t know how to put this.  In my line of work, you never speak the
truth--at least not directly.  But you are a fellow marine."

Frank listened.

"I\'m going to give it to you straight.  I work for Eneri Giilaan."

Not a muscle moved on Frank\'s face.  He didn\'t say anything in
response either.  Tiko searched for clues to tell him how Frank was
taking this news, but Fornne looked like he was caste in granite. 
Frank could play the game with the best of them.  

Tiko nodded his head in appraisal.  "Now I know why they call you the
Rock.  You\'re a natural.  Eneri picked you well."

"I don\'t work for Eneri Giilaan."  Frank was careful not to give
anything away that he didn\'t want given away.  He had seen what kind
of people Eneri had working for him.  Thoughts of innocent people
being murdered just because they forgot to call in sick the day Frank
was on Natoko flashed through his head.  

A quick glance to the floor told him where the multitool was.  It was
the closest weapon Frank had at hand.  Then he darted his eyes back up
to Tiko, searching to see if the ex-marine was on to him.

Tiko\'s face became warm with practiced ease.  He pretended not to
notice, but, yes, he knew what Frank was thinking.  The man was a
professional--one just like another Frank had met recently, Jod
Sarkin.

Tiko went on like they were talking about the weather.  "You might not
think you are working for Eneri, but you are."

Frank stood ready, his body stiff.  He had seen Tiko fight with a
weapon, and he knew that the man in front of him was probably better
with his bare hands.  In this man\'s line of work, Frank was sure that
loud guns were not used that often.

"Look, I know what you are thinking."  Tiko kept the nonchalant tone. 
"It\'s that moment of indecision for you isn\'t it?  Do I go for he
multitool now, or do I wait for a better opportunity?"

The ex-marine seemed almost playful.  "Or has the best time to make
your move already passed?"

Tiko began, slowly, to bend down.  It gave Frank a start. 
Automatically, his fists came up to defend himself.

Taking a step backwards, Tiko raised his hands, still bending at the
waist, palms open.  "Hold on there big shooter.  I\'m not here to hurt
you."  He lowered one arm, ever so slowly, and scooped up the
multitool.  Throughout the whole motion, he kept his head up, locking
eyes with Frank.

Frank saw the multitool in Tiko\'s hand.  His biceps strained as he
clenched his fists tight, ready to fight for his life.  The bastard
had maneuvered himself closer to the weapon.  He just bent down and
grabbed it.  Frank could try a kick, but given the distance, he was
sure that Tiko would be able to act first.

Slowly bending back up, the multitool held by only a couple of fingers
in his left hand, Tiko brought it towards Frank.

Frank remembered from the combat that Tiko was right handed, and now
the multitool was offered to him, lying in Tiko\'s open left hand.

"Go ahead, take it."

Frank hesitated.

"No tricks, I promise you."  Tiko moved and jerked the tool closer
towards Frank.

Silence.

"TAKE IT."

Frank lowered his fists to his sides.  "I\'m done working on the
reactor at this time."

The tense moment that seemed to overcome Tiko swiftly faded.  His face
relaxing in that practiced grin again, he tossed the tool to the
floor.

Frank looked up to see if anybody heard the multitool strike the metal
deck, but nobody came to the open ceiling hatch.  It was strange,
Frank thought, for such a small station, and for so many people
aboard--all on one deck, he felt completely isolated.  There was no
where for him to turn.

Tiko\'s demeanor became even more casual.  Frank knew not to trust this
guy--not one millimeter.

There was an almost instantaneous movement contrasting itself from
Tiko\'s smooth, even motions up until then.  A short zip, a jerked arm,
the sound of metal on leather, and all of a sudden Tiko stood there
with a gleaming gauss pistol in his hand.  

Frank noticed that it was his right hand.  Back to the slow, casual
movements, Tiko used his left to re-zip the front of his coverall. 

"Shit."  Frank was surprised he had said it.

This made Tiko chuckle.  "What, this Frank?"  He motioned to the
weapon in his hands and shook his head.  "You shouldn\'t be afraid of
this."

Expertly, the ex-marine clicked the magazine release on the weapon,
catching the falling clip in his left hand.  He tilted it toward
Frank.  The high explosive round shined at the top of the clip from
the light in the low ceiling.

"This is a tech level 13 gauss pistol--standard marine issue.  I\'m
sure you are familiar with them."

Frank watched as Tiko\'s hands slid delicately across the weapon like a
16 year old\'s hands across young, milky white tits.  He slapped the
clip back into the handle, pulled the slide back to chamber a round
and activate the magnetic barrel, and clicked the safety off.

Frank noticed that his own brow had begun to sweat.

"It\'s a beautiful weapon, Frank.  The Imperium sure knows what it is
doing issuing these."  Tiko measured the weight the hand gun.  "It\'s
well balanced, albeit a bit heavy for a hand gun."  He winked at
Frank.  "It\'s that battery that charges the frictionless barrel. 
Those little 4 gram needle- like puppies fly out of this thing at 1500
meters per second."

He studied the gun\'s profile and motioned towards Frank.  "At this
range, with this ammo, it will put a little hole in the front of a man
but blow out his backside.  Nasty business, those HE rounds--and all
that power in a little, light weight, 4mm round."

Tiko locked on to Frank\'s face.  He didn\'t blink.  The gun tossed into
the air, end over end, and slapped back into Tiko\'s hand, who used
only his peripheral vision when he caught the weapon.

Frank looked at Tiko\'s hand and saw that he was holding the gun by the
barrel.

"The purpose of all this, Frank, is to cut through all the bullshit. 
I know you don\'t trust me, so I\'m going to have to take a risk."  He
shoved the gun out towards Frank, handle first.

Frank glanced at the weapon, but did not take it.

"Go ahead, Frank.  The gun\'s yours.  You take it."

Frank stood there.  He wasn\'t sure what to do.

Tiko took a step forward.  Gently he touched Frank\'s wrist and put the
weapon into Frank\'s hand.  Nose to nose, he whispered, "Take the damn
thing."

Frank gripped the weapon, and Tiko stepped back, slowly.

"Now, you\'ve got the upper hand, Frank.  I don\'t have any other
weapons."  Tiko raised his hands.  "You can call your friends.  You
can kill me.  Or, you can listen to what I have to say.  What\'ll it
be?"

Frank raised the weapon at Tiko.  "There may only be one round in this
thing, but it looked real enough to me."

Tiko kept his hands in the air, careful not to make any motions.  "It
fully loaded, I assure you."

Frank raised one hand to the communicator on his belt.  His finger
hovered over the transmit control.  The gun he kept aimed at Tiko\'s
chest, dead center, where the man\'s heart was.  "Pull your arms out of
your coverall and drop the garment to your knees."

Tiko cracked that grin again.  "Smart cookie.  Yep, Eneri did a good
job in picking you."  He glanced to the open hatch.  "If somebody
happens in, they\'re gonna think that we are butt monkeys."

Frank didn\'t smile.  "Do it."

Tiko did as Fornne asked.  First one arm came out, then the other,
before the whole garment was wadded up around his ankles.

Tiko had a marine issue green tank on but nothing more than that other
than a pair of skivvies and his shoulder holster.

"Are you satisfied?"  Tiko asked.   "You see, no other weapons.  Can I
pull my pants up now?"

"Yeah, I\'m satisfied, and no you can\'t,"  Frank said.  "I like the
idea of your legs being hindered."

Frank\'s comm crackled to life.  "Frank, Drake here.  What\'s the
progress on the reactor."

For once, Tiko\'s practiced expression faded as he looked to Frank for
his reply.

Fornne studied the ex-marine, then made his decision.  The finger
pressed transmit control.  "Frank here, Captain.  Everything\'s under
control."

"Do you want me to send you down some help?"

"Negative.  It\'s a one man job here.  The panel is too narrow for more
than one to work.  Besides, I\'m almost done.  I\'ll see you topside in
a bit."

"Roger.  Drake out."

A genuine smile crossed Tiko\'s face.  It was one of admiration.  "For
a raw recruit, you sure are a natural.  That was deftly handled.  You
keep things under control here by keeping the others out of the
picture, but you put in a saving grace in case you get into trouble. 
If it is too long before somebody sees you, the Captain will come
looking.  Deftly handled, yes."

Frank ignored Tiko\'s praise.  "Well, before that time runs out, you\'d
better start talking."

"All right.  As I said, I work for Eneri Giilaan.  As you can guess,
I\'m here to get the brooch."

"Why?"

"Because Eneri wants it.  I don\'t usually ask those kinds of
questions."

"Why does Eneri want the brooch?"

"I told you.  I don\'t know.  I just follow orders."

Frank was unhappy with that.  He\'d have to come back to it.  "Go on."

"I\'m Naval Intelligence."  Tiko said.  "You were wanted back on
Aramis.  It wasn\'t anything big-- just the break in at the museum and
the illegal run outsystem.  The locals were dragging their feet with
catching up with you.  Eneri pulled some strings to get a Marine
detachment after you.  The plan was to capture you and the rest of
your crewmates then cart you off back to Aramis."

"But,"  Frank queried, "Eneri helped us get off Natoko--Jod Sarkin."

"Yes, I know.  But think about it.  He wasn\'t helping you.  You were
helping him get the brooch out and away from Aramis.  You are a
channel that nobody knows about.  Eneri\'s plan was to get you off,
with the brooch..."

"...and turn the brooch back over to him,"  Frank finished.  "When I
didn\'t try to contact him at Patinir, he got worried that I was going
to disappear with the thing."

Tiko shook his head.  "Correct.  You were wanted by the Aramis
authorities, so it should have been a simple matter of capturing you
and shipping you back to Aramis.  My orders were to get you back there
safe and sound."

"Sans the brooch."  Frank said.

"Right,"  Tiko agreed, "without the brooch.  We were going to get it
when we searched you.  But, we never got around to that.  This
emergency is real."

"What about Captain Sturm?"

"The good Captain was a pain in the ass.  Given Eneri\'s position in
Imperial NI, it was real easy to get the Marine squad and the SD boat
to go after you.  Because of the recent personnel changes at the
Aramis base--something I\'m sure Gyr told you about, it was also easy
to substitute my team, the four aces, in place of a real Marine
detachment.

Your Captain gave us a problem, though.  Eneri hadn\'t reckoned on just
how tight your relationship was with the base commander, and Sturm
pushed his weight around to get a seat on the SD boat.  He even
obtained command of the mission.  Sturm was bound and determined to
find out why you were wanted and what you were mixed up in.

Eneri could have pushed to remove Sturm\'s command, but not without
attracting too much attention.  Instead, we were to ensure that the
brooch was recovered whether or not you were extradited to Aramis.

Eneri could care less about the charges back there.  He only wants the
brooch."

"So, Sturm knew nothing of your real mission?"  Frank asked.

"Hell no.  All he was concerned with there was making sure that you
were looked after.  He always wanted to know why.  He just couldn\'t
believe that you could be mixed up in something without good reason."

Tiko was sincere.  "You lost a good friend in Sturm.  We could have
taken you at Patinir, but Sturm fought my team leader and the boat
commander when he decided to follow you to Pysadi."

Now was not the time to be sentimental, Frank knew.  He pushed on. 
"What\'s so damn important about this brooch?"

"I told you, I just don\'t know--on my honor."

"You work for Eneri Giilaan.  What do you know of honor?"

Tiko was silent for a moment.  "I know a great deal about honor.  Your
friend wasn\'t the only good man that died this day.  Three of my
closest friends lie dead down there too.  These were men that saved my
life, and I\'ve saved theirs.  We were a team, and closer than most
lovers or best friends will ever be.

What do I know of honor?  I know enough not to kill those who have
fought beside me.  I gave you a loaded gun, didn\'t I?  And I\'m talking
to you about my top secret mission, aren\'t I?  Haven\'t you asked
yourself why I haven\'t taken the brooch already and spaced the rest of
you?"

Frank looked at him hard.  "I can only guess that you still need us."

"Sure,"  said Tiko, "but why am I talking to you now?  Why don\'t I
just wait until we are close to orbit at Pysadi, kill the rest of you,
and take the brooch?  Why?"

"Tell me."  Frank said.

Tiko was dead serious.  "It\'s because I\'m one of the good guys.  I\'m
Imperial Naval Intelligence.  I don\'t kill Imperial citizens without a
good reason."

"Wasn\'t Jod Sarkin NI also?"

Tiko shook his head.  "Yes, Jod is deep cover for NI inside Tukera on
Natoko.  I\'m sure whatever he did, he did in the line of duty.  Jod\'s
a good man."

"That good man, as you call him,"  Frank snarled, "killed several
Imperial citizens, men and women, whose only crime was to go to work
on the wrong day."

Tiko moved his hands for the first time since Frank has had the gun on
him.  "I\'m sure he had his reasons.  I don\'t know.  I wasn\'t there. 
But, I am here."

At Tiko\'s movement, Frank twitched the gun to let him know that it was
still trained on him.  Tiko seemed not to notice.

"Frank,  I\'m not sure you realize what\'s going on here.  The brooch is
important, yes.  It was my primary mission."

Frank could see that Tiko had caught his interest in the buzz phrase.

"That\'s right, Frank.  I said was.  I really don\'t know what this
brooch thing is all about, but I do know that we\'ve stumbled onto
preliminary staging for a Zhodani invasion and another Frontier War.

You\'ve got to be putting this all together by now.  I\'ve been briefed
on the Kafer.  I\'ve told you all I know about their combat
capabilities, but I haven\'t told you everything I know about them.  We
have reason to believe that they are the puppets of the Zhodani
Consulate."

Frank was letting this all sink in.

"Think about it."  Tiko continued,  "How could a race of
semi-intelligent bugs have the technology that they possess?"

"I don\'t know enough about them."  Frank answered.

"Well, I\'ll answer that for you,"  Tiko said.  "The Zhodani control
them by giving them the technology.  That\'s right.  The Zhodani
control Kafer technology."

Frank began to realize, "And, the Zhodani don\'t want to risk an
incident before they are ready.  All of the saber rattling and the
news reports...they\'re true.  That reporter that predicted another war
between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate--he was right on the
mark."

"That\'s right."   Tiko agreed.  "We\'ve been on alert for some time in
NI.  I\'m probably the first agent with real proof.  I\'ve got to get
back to Aramis to report."

"But I don\'t understand,"  Continued Frank.  "What do the Kafer, or
the Zhodani, want in this system?"

"It\'s pre-invasion planning,"  Tiko went on.  "They\'re confirming
their intelligence about Imperial space."

Frank protested, "But, we\'re eight parsecs into Imperial space.  This
system has no military value.  It\'s undeveloped.  If their was
something important here, then the Imperium would already have a base
here."

"That\'s where you are wrong, Frank.  Sure, Pysadi is too far into the
interior of Imperial space to be valuable for the first strike, but
we\'re only two parsecs from Aramis, the subsector Capitol, and the
Aramis Trace.  Pysadi is also within striking distance of the Rhylanor
subsector."

"They\'re planning on using Pysadi as a staging point to continue the
war after the invasion?  Why--when there are ship building facilities
capable of supporting that type of war effort on Natoko and Aramis?" 
Frank asked.

The Real Tiko (cont)

By Kenneth D. Bearden



"There are also Imperial Naval bases at L\' oeul d\' Dieu, Aramis, and
Natoko."  Tiko responded.  "It\'s my guess that the Zho\'s are planning
a blitzkrieg type invasion, swooping deep into Imperial territory,
bypassing any major point of resistance.  Once they get there, it\'s
easy to cut supply lines and secure the whole subsector.  Then, they
will be in a much better position to deal with those bases and strike
further into Imperial territory in the Rhylanor subsector."

"But, Tiko, why pick Pysadi?  I mean, I know that the system has no
defenses to speak of, but the system is also undeveloped.  There\'s
simply nothing here.  It seems that one of the other worlds in the
Scatters would be a better choice."

"Yes, that would be true, Frank, but you are forgetting what this
autodrone was given to Pysadi to do.  It\'s true that Pysadi has no
defenses.  That\'s a plus for an invasion.  There\'s also large gas
giant present in the system to provide unlimited fuel to run a fleet
on.  That\'s plus number two.  But the biggest plus is in that
information that Professor Mir has been so concerned about
protecting."

"Yes."  Frank interjected at Tiko\'s pause.

"Frank, the planet below is full of Lanthanum.  It\'s the motherload
that the professor thought was here.  It\'s exactly the type of load
that can put Pysadi on the map.  The Zho\'s have probably gotten wind
of this.  They\'ve sent the Kafers forward, probably through Vargr
space, sneaking from system to system, into Imperial space, with the
supreme goal of confirming their intelligence."

"I see,"  Frank said.  "The Kafers are here to get Professor Mir\'s
data.  If they\'re caught, it will be the unintelligible bug like race
that we know nothing about.  If they are successful, the Zho\'s confirm
that Lanthanum is here, and Pysadi goes into their battle plans as a
primary target when the invasion starts.  Then, they build a base here
from which to continue the invasion deeper into Imperial territory. 
There\'s no initial resistance, so the attack can be assured, and there
is a gas giant here to fuel the fleet while the base facilities are
being built."

Tiko nodded.  "That\'s how I see it.  Except the Zho\'s don\'t know at
this point that we\'ve put two and two together from our previous
encounters with the Kafers.  We know that they are working with the
Zhodani."

"Why are you telling me all of this?"

Tiko held up two fingers.  "Two reasons.  First, somebody else has to
know the importance of what is happening here and get that information
back to Aramis.  Right now, that\'s my job, but if something happens to
me--we\'re not out of the danger yet, it will be up to you.  If I\'m
taken out, you will need to get this information back to Eneri.

The second reason is that I cannot find a way to complete my first
mission in light of what has happened.  Whether you and your friends
know it or not, you may have just saved the Imperium from an invasion.
 You\'ve definitely just helped to defend it.  If it was easy to get
the brooch, I\'d take it with me, but that vargr always has it around
his neck.  Besides that, up until a few hours ago, we were in vac
suits all the time.  The only way to get the brooch, as far as I can
see, is to kill him."

"I am not going to kill him."  Frank interjected right there.  "And,
neither are you.  If he dies, you die."

Tiko\'s hands flew back up to the \'hands up\' position.  "Take it easy! 
That\'s what I\'ve been trying to tell you.  I\'ve fought beside you
people, and you\'ve just done your government a great service.  I\'m not
going to kill anyone.  You\'ve all earned my respect.  That\'s why I\'m
talking to you now."

Tiko sounded sincere.  "I\'ve resigned myself to going back without it.
 This news of the Kafers takes precedence.  But, I can\'t pretend that
I didn\'t have a primary mission.  I\'m transferring that mission to
you.  You can get it--if not now then sometime in the future, and
forward it to Giilaan.  When we get back to Pysadi, I\'ll need
transport back to Aramis.  I\'ll take the boat if it survived the run
in with the Kafer battleship."

Tiko shrugged.  "Of course, I sincerely doubt that.  I\'ll get passage
on a ship, if there\'s one in port.  If not, I\'ll have to commandeer
the Harrier.  The information reaching Aramis is paramount."

"Why didn\'t you just keep all this to yourself, and then commandeer
the ship back to Aramis?"  Frank asked.  "It seems that way you\'d get
the info back and return with the brooch."

Tiko looked at Frank.  Frank was sure that he was seeing honesty in
the man\'s face.  "Like I said, Frank, there needed to be at least two
of us who knew the importance of what is going on here."  The
ex-marine paused.  "And I\'d like to see no harm come to any of you. 
Any of you would have given your lives for the others.  I said that I
respect that.  Trust me when I say that I don\'t have respect like this
very often.  I\'d like to see the brooch returned to Eneri.  If that
can be done without hurting anyone, then I\'ll do it.  If it can\'t,
then it is up to you.  You can get it at some opportune time in the
future.  Do you still have the locator card for Eneri on Junidy?"

"Yes."  Frank spoke.

"Well, then.  Get the brooch and get it to him on Junidy.  I\'ve got to
get back to Aramis with this information."

Frank lowered the gun.

"I take it this means that you believe me."  Tiko said.

"I believe you."

"Well, then,"  Tiko continued, "can I pull up my pants then?"

Frank motioned \'up\' with the gun.  Tiko laughed at the situation and
pulled his coverall over his shoulders.

Before he could zip, there was the sound of a boot on the metal rung
of the ladder.  Frank shot a glance that way to see Praygor stepping
down from the higher deck.  "Frank, I just thought I\'d come check on
you to see how yo..."

The Captain stopped in mid-sentence.  Tiko stood there with an open
coverall, but Frank could see that the gun in his hand is what caught
the Captain\'s attention.  "What\'s going on here, Frank?"

Frank stumbled for words, but Tiko, the professional that he is, took
the line smooth as silk.  "I was just showing Frank here my military
issue pistol, Luke."  

Tiko reached out to grip the gun in Frank\'s hand.  Their eyes met, and
Frank became nonchalant.  "Yes, Captain,"  Frank agreed, "it\'s been a
while since I held one of these."  He released the weapon to Tiko and
looked him straight in the eye as he finished addressing the Captain. 
"We were just talking about old times."

Praygor, paused halfway down the ladder where he had stopped when he
saw the gun and the peculiar situation, said, "What do you think this
is, man, show and tell hour?  We\'ve got work to do, and we\'ve got to
get out of here before that Kafer battleship shows back up.  Are you
too going vac-crazy on me?"

"No sir."  This time it was Tiko.  "We just took a short break."

"That\'s right."  Frank agreed.  "I\'m almost done with the reactor."

Praygor looked down on them.  "That\'s what you told me last time. 
We\'ve got live Kafers trying to get out of the front bay.  There\'s a
battleship out there that could show up at any time and blow us to
bits, and we haven\'t got the station fully functional yet.  Are you
two out of your minds?"

Frank walked over to the multi-tool, still laying on the deck.  "I\'ll
be done in a jiffy."

"You\'d better."  With that, Praygor plunked back up the hatch.

Frank addressed Tiko.  "And what about that battleship?"

"Yes, that."  Tiko said.  "I don\'t think we\'ll see it again if we get
this bucket moving."

Frank raised an eyebrow.  "Why\'s that?"

"Because I know where the battleship is."

Frank couldn\'t help but scoff. "You wanna let me in on that?"

"Sure."  Tiko agreed.  "It\'s running outsystem."

"And how do you know that?"  

"Well,"  Tiko said, "it took about three days for the commtorp to
reach Pysadi when we picked up the distress call.  I figure that was
the first time the battleship appeared.  Since it was a 40,000 ton
ship, it\'s easy to spot.  Pysadi is not any well traveled star course
by any means, but it does see its share of tramp freighters like the
Harrier.  My guess is that the Kafer ship has orders for minimal
contact and silent running to keep its secrecy.  They reached the
autodrone, dropped off a thousand or so Kafers, which they thought
would do the trick, to attack the station and get the planetary data. 
Not wanting to stay around to minimize detection, especially while an
attack was going on, the ship headed for deep space out system.  The
plan was to swing back and pick up the data."

"But we\'ve already figured out that their life support in their suits
only lasts 15 standard hours."  Frank posited.  "How did they expect
to get the data?"

"They probably have some sort of homing system.  Maybe the leaders
were instructed to do something with the data so that the ship could
find the information."

"So when the ship reappeared when we got here,"  Frank continued,
"they were not surprised to see all of their troops dead because the
life support is only 15 hours?  What kind of intelligent race sends a
thousand of its own kind out to certain death just to obtain some
information?"

"The kind that we are dealing with here."

"Damn."  

"Yeah, that\'s right,"  Tiko agreed, "damn."

Frank calculated.  "So, given that the ship showed up and dropped the
first load of Kafers...that\'s three days transit time for the commtorp
and about three days travel time for us to get here...then the ship
reappeared to drop another load to get the info once they saw that the
first group was unsuccessful and, apparently, the Imperium was not
notified.  That\'s six days in between drops."

"Right."  Tiko nodded, "I\'m thinking that the ship is taking six days
to swing out system and return.  We\'ve been here a day, so the ship
will probably be here in another five days.  Given our repairs, we
should be almost to Pysadi by then."

"What if the battleship attacks Pysadi looking for the data?"

"They won\'t do that,"  said Tiko.  "It will tip their hand.  This is a
covert information gathering mission for them.  They\'ll go back
without it first, and if I can get back to Aramis in time, I might be
able to set some Imperial cruisers on their trail.  Maybe they can
catch up with them before they leave Imperial space."

Frank thought about the Kafer and their tactics.  "I just don\'t get
them.  They\'d kill two thousand of their own kind for intelligence."

"Intelligence is the key word here,"  Tiko answered.  "From our
previous contacts with them, that\'s how they operate.  There is some
sort of chemical imbalance in their brains.  I\'m not an expert on
their brains so I don\'t know all the specifics, but I do know that the
information transferring system in their brains is naturally hindered.
 From what I\'ve been told, the theory is that their brain swells, much
like most matter does in heat, and this constricts information
transfer.  This is their normal state.  When they are in danger or
otherwise aroused, however, nature takes over with a built in defense
system.  The brain shrinks, like it is cold or something, and the
information transfer process is no longer hindered.  In reality, they
are just as intelligent as any other sentient race."

"We think,"  Tiko continued, "that the Kafer are not natural to their
homeworld.  There\'s reason to believe that they were transplanted from
some other place sometime during their evolution-- maybe by the
Ancients, maybe by somebody else.

Postulating, we believe that the Zhodani happened upon the Kafer--who
had only a rudimentary stone age technology.  They were probably not
much more than semi-intelligent cattle, but the Zho\'s figured out that
the race was intelligent.  I\'m sure the Zhodani advanced psionics had
something to do with this."

"Besides,"  Tiko said, "not all of the Kafer are effected equally by
their brain processes.  Notice that the ones that are used as leaders
seem to have a higher intelligence than the others.  We think that the
planet they evolved on, where the Zho\'s found them, had something to
do with their brain hindrance.  Maybe it was the gravity.  Maybe it
was something they ate.  Maybe it was something in the air.  I don\'t
know.

The Zhodani found them and trained them.  They capitalized on their
tribal-like war-party tactics and gave them higher technology.  This
is what we\'ve just been up against."

"Uh-hmm," Frank said.  "So they hit something hard, with a bunch of
might, and be damned with tactics.  If they are going in the front
door, they\'re just going to keep sending men in until the task is
accomplished."

"Exactly,"  agreed Tiko.  "The battleship dropped off about a thousand
men.  Given their low intelligence in this new situation, that is very
confusing to them.  The first group was not successful in gaining
access to the station."

Tiko made a circling motion with his finger.  "The battleship swung
around its trip outsystem, saw that the first group had not
accomplished its goal, and dropped off another thousand or so--but
this time, the Kafer have learned from the first\'s actions.  This
second group, the one we encountered, was even more deadly.  But as
you have seen, we have defeated them using our noggins."

Frank was quiet, thinking about the whole situation.

Tiko went on.  "Every time we have come across them in space, the
story is the same.  From what we\'ve seen, they have several large
ships, and when they attack a target in space, they hit it with a
large fleet of ships.  We may be able to destroy them 5 to 1, but they
hit us with 10 to 1 odds."

Frank blew a whistle.  "Geez, man.  There must be an incredible number
of these Kafers at the disposal of the Zhodani."

"That\'s what we\'ve been thinking.  The Zho\'s have an incredible war
resource in them.  They\'re dumb, follow orders to the \'T\', and
exceptionally loyal.  Danger actually increases their thinking.  It\'s
like a drug--the more you are successful in repelling them, the more
dangerous they become."

"And, the Zho\'s have given modern day weapons to a race with a cave
man mentality."  Frank said.

"That\'s right,"  said Tiko.

"An unstoppable force that just keeps coming,"  Frank continued.  "You
kill one and nine more take his place--with their moral higher than
before you killed him."

"Now you see the importance of getting this information back to
Aramis?"  Tiko asked.  "This is why I\'ve let you in on it.  I need
your help to ensure that the information reaches Eneri and the others
at the Aramis Naval Base."

"I agree 100%,"  Frank answered.  "What do you want me to do about the
brooch?"

"Stick with it.  Take it if you can.  Get it back to Eneri on Junidy."

Frank asked, "What are you going to tell Eneri about it?"

"I don\'t know,"  Tiko said, "I\'ll think of something.  I\'ll just tell
him I couldn\'t get it and that you are keeping an eye on it.  I\'ll
tell him we\'ve reverted to plan A."

"I\'m not going to betray Gvoudzon,"  Frank told him again.

"I understand that,"  Tiko said.  "I don\'t expect you to.  Use your
own discretion--tell him if you think it will help.  Like it or not,
you\'re working for Eneri now."  Tiko paused to underscore the
seriousness.  "You\'re working for your government."

"I\'ll do it."  Frank shook his head affirmative.

"Just keep up business as usual,"  Tiko directed.  "We\'ll keep up with
where the Harrier is.  When the time comes, you\'ll be contacted.  And,
be careful.  Tukera\'s on to you too."

"Tukera?"  Frank said with a start, "What do they have to do with
this?"

"We\'re not sure,"  Tiko answered.  "But we do know that they are
involved.  That\'s part of Jod\'s job on Natoko--to find out what their
involvement is.  And they can be dangerous.  Remember the people who
attacked Gvoudzon wanting the brooch back on Aramis?"

"I thought that was you guys."  Frank countered.

"Hell no,"  Tiko came back.  "Eneri\'s confirmed that was the
Vemene--Tukera\'s covert security agency.  They\'re just as equipped as
any of the Imperium\'s intelligence agencies, and they can be nasty
customers."

Frank caught on.  "The ones who Gvoudzon said was watching him at
work--and watching his apartment?"

"Right."  Tiko said.  "They had tracked the brooch to Gvoudzon and
Aramis.  As far as we can tell, they had him under surveillance
looking for a clue to the location of the brooch.  When that didn\'t
work, they decided to get a little more direct information, so they
attacked him--figuring the brooch was on him somewhere.  Luckily, he
had already pawned it, and this was not yet discovered by the Vemene."

"That\'s when Too and I happened upon him outside the Happy Spacer in
Startown."  Frank saw some of the pieces falling into place.

"Yes, that\'s right.  And besides that, this was the second time you
and the Harrier crew had shown up in our investigation.  Eneri had
already taken notice of you when Glynn approached Roet Bannerji, who
we had under surveillance.  After contacting you, Eneri found out
where the brooch was.  This connected you a second time to Imperial
intelligence.  Instead of officially going to the museum at taking it,
he saw an opportunity to use you to get it for him--keeping the agency
out of it.  We didn\'t want to tip off that we were on to the brooch. 
The situation, as it presented itself, was perfect for our purposes."

Frank\'s look turned hard.  "Oh, it\'s crystal now.  We\'re bait.  Eneri
is watching where the brooch will take him."

Tiko looked at his feet.  "That\'s right.  If there is an opportunity
to get the brooch without tipping our hand to the other side, like we
had when we were going to capture you and send you back to Aramis,
we\'ll take it.  But, we\'re not going to risk alerting the other side
that we\'re on to the brooch.  Of course, we\'re taking a risk not
having the brooch in our actual possession.  Hell, it could have been
lost back on the OSIRIS base as you fought those androids, but given
the current arrangement, I\'m taking it upon myself to let it stay with
you.  If you can get it--great.  If you can\'t, we\'ll be watching.  At
some point, we\'ll meet up at Junidy."

Tiko continued,  "You realize that I\'m going out on a limb
here--bringing you into the fold."

Frank looked back at him.

"You\'re not a trained operative.  You\'re not sworn to uphold the
integrity of the Imperium, like I am."

"I\'m a Marine."  Frank said it proud.

Tiko agreed.  "As was I.  And, I\'m a good judge of character.  It\'s
kinda a job requirement.  You\'ll do what is right for your government.
 I know it."

Frank looked down at Tiko\'s outstretched hand.

"You may not trust me yet, Frank, but believe me, we\'re on the same
side."

Frank clasped the man\'s hand.  "We\'ll see."

Tiko couldn\'t help but laugh.  "Yes, you\'re going to do fine.  One of
the other job requirements is to trust no one."  He looked at Frank
appraisingly.  "Yes, my boss picked you well."

Frank released Tiko\'s hand.  "So I\'m supposed to keep an eye on the
brooch, but go about business as usual.  If I find an opportunity,
I\'ll get the brooch, but if not, I\'ll hear from you."

"Probably somebody else."  Tiko corrected.

"What if Drake poses a problem?"

Tiko dismissed that.  "Don\'t worry about your Captain.  We know all
about him.  If it comes time to let him in--that is, we let Baron Vaan
Praygor in, on what is happening with the brooch or any other official
secret, we\'ve got a leash on him.  If he poses too much of a problem,
we\'ll make sure that the Jade-Londonists find out where he is."

Frank\'s eyes widened with the mention of the Captain\'s real name. 
These people seemed to have every angle fixed.  He\'d do well to stay
on their good side.

"We\'ll not talk of this again."

"Understood,"  Frank said.  "We\'d better get this tub moving before
that Kafer battleship comes back."



                         l         l          l



Praygor eased back from the floor hatch.  He could hear that Frank and
Tiko had turned their attention back to repairing the reactor.  He had
just heard all that was important to him.

Sweat began to form on his brow.  Slowly easing back on his hands and
knees, careful not to make a sound that would alert the two below, and

Fun stuff. I have also used something similar for boarding actions.
Marines use it for cutting through walls, etc. Picture a glue gun that
rolls out a thick bead of some type of shaped charge, roll it out in a
large circle, stand back, BANG, instant door.=20

I would love to see more of these ideas, as well as some archaic toys

Well, BD has a view slit, joints that have to be flexible, and other weak
points.. perhaps your shot hit one of them.  The point of spectacular sucess
is that not only does the character suceed, he does so in an amazing manner.
My first thought would be that the round hit the Marine\'s plasma weapon,
causing it to explode when fired, severly wounding the Marine..

White globes are black globes that \'flicker\'. Normal black globe lets
nothing in or out, you are safe, but you can\'t shoot, either. \'Flickering\'
the field would be timed to weapons/sensors so that you could get a shot off
between times the field was up. And hoped no one else had gotten the timing
down on your \'flicker\' rate to hit you when you were trying to shoot.

I believe all such devices were ancient artifacts only in CT. FF&S changed
the definition so that black & white were different, and could be
manufactured at tech level 15+.

I\'ve never assumed that. To me a flickering Black Globe is just that: a 
Flickering Black Globe. A White Globe has always been a "one way" Black 
Globe. Energy can leave when it\'s on, but never enter. Black Globes are 
introduced at TL-15, White Globes at TL-20.

Quoth MegaTraveller Referee\'s Manual, page 80:
"White globes restrict any projectile or beam from contacting the craft 
while still allowing the occupants to see out and to use sensors without 
restriction."

>I believe all such devices were ancient artifacts only in CT. FF&S changed
>the definition so that black & white were different, and could be
>manufactured at tech level 15+.

Quoth Book 5: High Guard, page 31:

"Black globe generators are not available commercially; they are 
recovered artifacts installed on a makeshift basis or experimental 
versions installed on tech level 15 Imperial warships."

So, even in CT, there are *experimental* TL 15 manufactured black globes, 
presumably based on tinkering with recovered ancient artifacts and 
copying them.

And White Globes were introduced in MT. (I can\'t find and don\'t recall 
earlier references to White Globes). The definition certainly didn\'t 
change in FF&S.

Is this to say that a character who rolled boxcars during chargen, giving
EDU = C by age 18 is gifted?  I wonder, because, given yr (snipped)
equivalencies, that\'s equiv. to a master\'s degree, and, even using the
strictest attribute assignment (i.e., cast 2D6 for STR, 2D6 for END, etc.,
in a given order), 2.8% of all characters would wind up that way, and that\'s
BEFORE any higher education.

I\'ve fooled a bit with giving +1 EDU (NOT +4) for college completion, +1 for
advanced education completion (presumably, though in many situations not the
case, grad school is harder and more concentrated than undergrad), and +1
for honors (creme de la creme...)  This, at least, makes it less likely that
characters will have "wasted" several EDU points during chargen.  A starting
EDU of C, plus undergrad (+1), undergrad honors (+1), grad school (+1), and
grad honors (+1) will still waste a point of EDU (max = F, not F+1...), but
this reduces the problem (as perceived by me...) from a common one to a
relatively rare one I can generally ignore (and rationalize/argue when it
DOES occur!)...

What follows is my brief synopsis of Black/White Globe technology.


Effects:

    Black Globe: No matter/energy can penetrate or leave.
    Flickering Black Globe: Partial matter/energy transmission.
    White Globe: Matter/energy can leave, no matter/energy can penetrate.


Limits:

    Black Globe: Amount of energy ship capacitors can store.
    White Globe: Amount of energy ship capacitors can store and reliably 
discharge through the energy field (the field glows white when capacitors 
discharge, hence the name) Energy "thoroughput"

Neither Black nor White Globes are "inpregnable". There are limits to the 
amount of energy they can absorb. These limits are set by the capacitors 
installed on the ship.

For Black Globes, energy can\'t be quickly discharged while the shield is 
on. For White globes, energy is discharged as it is absorbed, but there 
is a maximum rate at which this can occur.


Comments:

Black Globe:

Useless as cloaking device unless the ship jumps insystem with the globe 
"on". If the globe is switched "on" after it has already been tracked by 
enemy sensors, the trajectory of the ship is set in stone, since it can 
no longer maneuver (no energy can leave, remember). So a no-flicker 
black-globed ship is a sitting duck. Enemy ships lock sensors on 
projected position and fire all weapons, overload the ship\'s 
capacitors... and... ***boom***.

However, even if the ship jumps insystem with the Globe "on", it is still 
detectible. It will show up as a big "hole" in background radiation 
passive sensor readings.

White Globe:

I disagree with your comment about "closest thing to a sci-fi shield 
there is." Most Sci-fi shield\'s appear to be ablative things that have 
their effectiveness reduced with each hit. "Shields at 10%, one more hit 
and we\'re toast!" The Traveller White Globe, by contrast, is always rated 
at the same efficiency, but can only handle so much damage at a time. 
"Capacitors discharging, now at 90% capacity... 80%... oh sh*t! We\'ve 
been hit with another 2000 Megawatts of laser fire!" <sound of capacitors 
exploding>

I think Black Globes are closer to standard Sci-fi shield\'s in that 
regard, since they are not as easily discharged, and therefore each hit 
is cumulative.

Also remember that if a large enough object (asteroid, spacecraft) were 
to try to penetrate a Black or White Globe, the shield diverts the 
kinetic energy of the object to the capacitors which overload and explode.

Vargr First Mate: "Keptin! The ship has raised its Black Globe!"
Kamikazi Captain: "Rrrramming Speed!"

PS. One thing I just thought of. A ship with a White Globe might have a 
better "cloaking device" if it can control the radiation of energy from 
the shield to precisely match background radiation. Energy striking the 
White Globe would simply be radiated out the opposite side.

I once combined the Doomsday Weapon from the Star Trek episode of, I think, the same 
name (first series), with the monstrous machinery from Forbidden Planet, and a weapon in 
the comic book series Six from Sirius.  The Forbidden Planet weapon, as you will recall, 
released "the monsters of the id" -- I even had a dying NPC gasp that out to the PCs -- 
which then ravaged the planet.  The Six from Sirius weapon was similar.  In my game, the 
monsters of the id -- including latent psionic powers -- of a planetary population were 
enough to blow a planet into asteroids (like the Doomsday Weapon).  It was of course an 
Ancient weapon, and there were NPC Droyne out looking for it, as well as Imperial and 
Zhodani spies.  

In the same campaign, there is a drug that unlocks some latent psionic powers.  The 
problems with the drug are that the psionic powers are unpredictable and uncontrollable, 
and that the drug is highly addictive, with more drug being needed to achieve the same 
effects each time.  It nevertheless sells well among those members of the 
counter-culture who believe that the Psionics Suppressions were a bad thing.  

I\'ve also taken the position that psionics don\'t work well in laboratory-type settings, 
basically because of the Heisenberg Principle:  measurement affects the thing measured. 
The Zhodani, the Droyne, and the Psionics Institutes all teach psionics in non-clinical, 
non-rational -- but well-planned -- settings.  This does slow down the acquisition of 
knowledge about the subject, however.

Correction: It will show up as a SMALL "hole" in background radiation. At
space combat ranges it would presumably be very hard to detect this unless
occulting a star (which is quite unlikely) given the small angular radius
of the ship at space combat ranges.

actually if i remeber corectly... tl-16 was the highest in the imperium...
and tl-25
was ancients..... based on Mega Traveller... but yes i agree i miss alot of
those
cool things found in CT and MT likes weapons etc.... maybe one day when
the emperor\'s arsenal gets released will se some of our favorites...

I think that QSDS & SSDS are ok but I cant bring myself to putting much
effort into designing ships when there is so much limitation in both
systems. 5000 ton max, am I to believe that the Imperium does not have a
ship bigger than that, even at TL12? Get serious!?! The design sequence in
MegaTraveller was even better!  

Of all the material that has been produced for T4, ship generation has been
given secondary consideration as far as I can see.  

If I am way off base here Please let me know.  I\'m not trying to rain on

     Ah yes.  The great Sir Harry Flashman, Hero of Kabul, veteran of
the Charge of the Light Brigade, world traveller, cricketer, and all around
good egg.  Brilliant, old boy.  Excellent suggestion indeed.  An old chum
of mine, in one of the better regiments, once told me that in his regiment,
old Flash Harry is regarded as the epitome of military virtue; when
confronted with a sticky wicket, the better officers merely ask themselves
"What would Flashy do?". <harrumph>  An excellent line of reasoning, and
one I say should be encouraged.  Pass the port, there\'s a good chap...

//Victorian upper-class twit spoof mode=off

     For those poor TML\'ers who haven\'t read them, the Flashman books
are utter brilliance, and deadly funny.  The basic premise is that the
hero, the bully in the classic _Tom Brown\'s Schooldays_, a totally
degenerate cad without a spot of virtue (I mean, really; he\'s a liar,
cheat, bully, coward, whoremonger, and general sleazeball) is expelled from
Rugby, and goes into the military...  and through diligent application of
his abovementioned, er, qualities, rises through the ranks at breakneck
speed and over the course of several novels gets  involuntarily involved in
most of the great conflicts of the 19th century.

     Flashy would make a great Traveller noble.

     And incidentally, the story about my friend guiding his military
decisions by asking "What would Flashy do?" is true.

Not necessarily. Wavelength matters. Even a millimeter wavelength maser
would be a pain to fit into a rifle A centimeter wavelength one would
be impossible.

Sheilding is also affected by wavelength. The beam will diffract around
some types of shielding.

From: Mark Clark <clarkm@OIT.EDU>
Subject: System Defense Boat Design

  To provide context for the Mercenary Cruiser THUDD competition, I\'m
fooling around with some System Defense Boat designs.  I took as a
starting point the Classic Traveller SDB from Supplement 7 - Traders and
Gunboats.  Based on a 400T hull, the CT SDB has 6G performance, mounts two
triple laser turrets and two triple missile turrets, and carries a crew of
10.  There is extra cargo space for missiles.  The ship uses TL12
technology.  Cost is about 775MCr.

  I fooled around with some lower tech designs using QSDS 1.5 and
Wildstars Big List of Hulls.  At TL9 it looks like a 400T SDB designed
with this system would carry only missiles, since no lasers are available,
and the smallest QSDS PA-Gun (CT N-PAWS) weighs in at 200T.  SSDS would
probably do a better job.  I\'d probably go with a mix of two types of
ships.  One type would have a larger hull, maybe 600T, with a PA-Gun,
a couple of missile batterys, and some sandcasters.  The second type would
be smaller, 200 or 300T, with missiles and sandcasters only.

  At TL10 QSDS gives you a laser bay weapon, though aside from power
consumption it\'s pretty much inferior to the TL-9 PA-Gun, especially in
terms of range. Again, missiles are still the best bet.  I put together a
nice 400T 6G SDB at TL10 with 2 laser bays, two missile turrets, two
sandcasters, and small military sensors, plus a big cargo bay for extra
missiles, all for about 610MCr.  Adding the medium military sensors would
run about 200MCr more.

  At TL11, the QSDS system gives you a nicer PA-Gun - half the tonnage
(100T), cheaper, and slightly less crew.  Looks good, so a SDB would
likely mount one of these, plus some laser turrets (finally available at
TL-11) and missile turrets.

  So that\'s the threat - consider it!
>Quote Mode off<

Interesting, I like your run down of SDB\'s over various tech levels.
I just wanted to mention a SDB that i created using QSDS.

>Role Playing On<
Introducing X-TEK\'s "Wulfen" Class Planetary Defence Boat.
The Wulfen is a 100td Airframe hull that offers maxium speed 6g. It can 
quickly chase down its prey in both atmosphere and vacuum.  It has 2 
military grade quad-las turrets wich provide both power and range.  Both are 
slaved to a Master Fire Director on the bridge, so that one gunner can 
co-ordinate fire from both turrets.  Both the lasers and the Drive Plates 
suck up tremoendous power, do a 500MW fusion plant was installed.  There is 
no room on the PDB for jump capability, it doesn\'t need it as  its primary 
mission specs do not require jump capability.
Variants of the PDB will include the PDB-Msl  the Missile PDB
the PDB-PA, the Particle accelerator PDB
and the PDB-Me, the Meson PDB

This class gets its name from the ancient Solomani-German "Wulfen" Wolf or 
Wolves.  Indeed these craft are most effective when in a large wing or 
flight, also known as the "Wolf Pack"
>Role Playing Off<

The exact specs of the Planetary Defence Boat are at my site
(http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/trav.htm)
From the Loby, go to Promenade, and then go to Shipyards.

amazing what one can do with a 100ton hull eh? :)

T4 is starting with the *founding* of the Third Imperium. That puts it
1100-1200 years *before* CT and Megatraveller.

There will be source material for other "eras", they are just starting
out with this one.

Well, sort of. Population I stars will *only* have gas giants as
planets, and they\'ll be almost pure hydrogren/helium. This requires
skimming, and I\'m not all that sure that you\'d find GGs often enough to
refuel.

The "deadfall" ordinance is basicly in orbit, and then given a nudge
that results in a new orbit that intersects the ground near the target.
Terminal guidance changes the "near" to "on". 

For earth, we\'re talking about 7 km/sec, and a "reasonable" de-orbit
impulse, so the total path could be several hundred KM (150-200 km
orbital height, plus a substantial sideways component.

Note that "flying crowbars" of this sort will *definitely take out a
tank. For bunkers and large vessels you use "flying telephone poles".
:-)

At these velocities you are talking about every kilo of projectile
being equivalent to almost 6 kilos of TNT. But in the form of a
directed "jet".

Maybe because the icecaps don\'t have enough water to fill a decent
*lake*, much less supply water (and oxygen!) for a decent ecosphere?

Remember, Mars has icecaps. But they are mostly frozen CO2. The water
is just a trace. 

Unless the planet has *substantial* amounts of water, using bacteria
etc won\'t help. If it *does* have that much water, it\'s more likely to
already *have* a breathable atmosphere, unless life never evolved as
far as developing photsynthesis.

Also, another reason for the "iceburg" approach would be something like
Venus. They can help increase the rotation, and cool things a little. 

Also, you need the "iceburgs" (or at least the hydrogen from them) and
a whole *bunch* of carbonaceous chondritic material, and some "stony"
bodies for the raw material for those huge mirrors! Hydrogen and carbon
for the plastic, aluminum for the coating. 

At one mil (25 microns) thick, a 1 km square film has a volume of 25
cubic meters. And a mass of a few hundred tons. Get the picture?

On 18 March, Tiger asked for some comments on the THUDDD voting system and
what how we think it could be bettered.  Here is my 0.02 Cr worth. My
feeling is that some of the categories on previous ballots have been too
detailed for non-starship designer. The categories left the impression that
you had to redesign each entry to ensure that it followed the QSDS or SSDS
rules. I think the typical Traveller players may not always know detailed
starship design, but they know what they like. 

To get better participation, I would suggest having two ballot types for
THUDDD. One straightforward ballot with which you could vote for your
favorite, rank order your three favorites, or rate each design from one to
ten. No details, no justification necessary; and it could be completed
quickly. The second ballot type would be for us gear-heads. It would
include a vote for the favorite design(s) to be tallied with the rest, but
it would go on to include more detailed criteria such as compliance with
design rules, economic considerations, etc. Because it would not be for
general consumption, it could include much more detailed criteria than
previous ballots. You might not get many ballots of the second type, but,
as a designer, I know I would like to see even a few detailed evaluations
of my entry. 

One problem with this system would be entries that totally blow the design
rules, but have popular appeal, i.e., a spinal mount meson gun on a cutter.
My suggestion here would be to have the gear-head ballot include a "pass -
fail" vote on design rules at the eighty or ninety percent level. By that I
mean let minor design glitches pass, but fail really serious infractions;
we all make mistakes, even me. I\'m sure that serious design infractions
would also be identified on the TML soon after the entries were posted.

Isn\'t there some evidence of a 65 million year extinction cycle?  Here
we have 66 million years from peak to trough. Maybe there *is* something
about being too far from the galactic plane!

Most black globes can flicker, and are either recovered Ancient artifacts,

Incorrect.  Stellar populations are numbered in _reverse_ order, if only
because Population I stars (like our Sun) were the first discovered.  When
metal-poor stars were found, they were christened Population II before
they were found to be older.  The putative class of _extremely_ metal-poor
stars (probably only red dwarfs still survive) has been called "Population
III" in the literature, IIRC.

FWIW, I believe the closest Pop II star to Sol is Arcturus -- its space
velocity suggests it\'s a cometary halo object (lots of II\'s there),
"passing through" the galactic disk.

That\'s the kind of relationship I think they would have with the Imperium as
well.  If we are taking the model (you could say /template/ :-) ) of these
guys from the Templars of old earth I think they will like to remain quite
aloof from the rest of imperial society as much of the mainstream of
Imperial Society shuns their ways and finds nobles acting in this way rather
distasteful.  They act more like a religious sect or secret society with
several factions in existence.  What distinguishes the Templars from most
mercenary groups (apart from the noble connections) is their deep seated
beliefs in a particular cause, whether protecting favoured primative races,
promoting (enforcing) a particular religion, recovering ancient relics (the
holy grail of grandfather), etc.  Whatever the cause there is always an
element of self-sacrifice.  Imagine the Templars of old Earth.  They trapsed
for mile upon gruelling mile across Europe, taking what food they could,
laying siege to enemy strongholds, looting and pillageing the spoils of war
...and that was just Europe, it got a lot tougher when they crossed into the
holy land.  Our Imperial Templars are likely to be just as hardy and
dedicated to their cause.  Noble wealth isn\'t squandered as elsewhere in the
Imperium but used for secret underhand gains.  Whilst they truely believe
their cause is for the greater good of humaniti, their fanatisism prevents
them from understanding "the other side of the arguement", those on the
wrong side will be dealt with mercilessly.  

So far the Imperium has tolerated these fanatical excesses, however Cleon is
carefully monitoring the situation using his operatives within the various
factions to subvert the Templars goals to those of the Emperor.  Official
Imperial involvement is of course completely hushed up.  Romanticized
legendary / mythical stories spread through the Imperial "chattering
classes".

T>- - I\'d say that rather than giving the Templars cushy bases on only the

I agree their bases are not cushy.  These are hardened, driven people. 
Whilst they are not adverse to the occasional luxury they live relatively
spartan lives (for a noble).  Their citadels would be fairly small
emplacements but well defended and defensible.  A ground based Citadel may
have the look of Jabba\'s palace crossed with the rebel stronghold on Hoth
(OK minus the daft defense shield).  Orbital stations are another
possibiltiy.  Deserted systems are definately preferred (maybe in the
undetailed portion of First Survey).

Now that\'s an excellent idea, some templar factions may also be based on
psionic teachings.  There could be other alien Templars as well.  Aslan
Templars could also fit the picture (I haven\'t got any info on the Aslan so
don\'t slate me if I\'ve offended any of you Kat lovers :-) ).  

Prehaps these Aslan Templars are ihatei? (forgive the spelling).

T>Oooh, I like this. :)

It\'s definately got possibilities.  Has there been anything like this
discussed before on the list?, or published in previous adventures/JTAS
articles?.  Similarities might be drawn with those Star Viking types :-?

Recent papers by Zubrin, Fogg, et al. have suggested that Mars may contain
significant amounts of subsurface permafrost.  We simply don\'t know, since
Viking decided to look for life instead of investigate the planet itself.
Here\'s hoping the next series of probes answers the question....

Marty Fogg, in a c. 1991 paper in JBIS re: terraforming Venus, did the
math for speeding up a planet via asteroid/cometary impacts and found it
woefully impractical (not to mention a waste of thousands of good
nickel-iron asteroids).  He actually found himself having to rig the
entire planet with cables to turn it into a squirrel-cage motor which took
power input to speed up rotation over tens of millenia.
 
Your point about needing small bodies as industrial feed-stock, whether
for solettas or shades, is a good one.

Actually, we are talking about a weapon that was "power-built" using a
set of rules that many consider "broken" :)

While the tech may change, the physics will stay the same.  When
fired, the weapon (and therefore, the operator) would receive the same
amount of sudden kinetic energy as the projectile.  Most of the
applicable recoil compensators in the Traveller universe are designed
to vent the gases of traditional slug throwers, not reduce the
"electromagnetic recoil" created in gauss weapons (the stock recoil
systems cannot be used with this weapon, since it was designed to be
fired as a pistol).  The TL10 gyro stabilizer is designed to keep the
weapon steady (like the stabilization units on today\'s tanks), not
reduce felt recoil to any degree.  Even the TL14 inertial compensator
is designed to transfer the recoil (through a locked articulated arm)
to the user, not simply "make it go away".

What I see when someone designs a weapon such as this is one person\'s
need for a traditional slug thrower that can be fired one-handed and
makes a really BIG noise.  Someone like this is more interested in the
excitement of the sheer "power" or "energy" being harnessed and/or
manipulated, and less interested in designing an efficient weapon.  We
must assume some reasoning behind the progression to laser and
plasma/fusion weaponry in the Traveller universe.  While it may not be
as glamorous as the Dirty Harry "kicks like a mule" hand-cannon image,
there are far more efficient ways of using level 12 technology to kill
someone :)

Of course, the gauss projectile in FF&S isn\'t simply a solid piece of
superdense...  :)

We are also dealing with a conductor coil inside the projectile, which
completes the electrical circuit for the accelerator.  Pump too much
energy through these windings too quickly and the projectile will be
slag before it even starts to move.

Or, if you use a non-canon gauss weapon design (one that uses a set of
windings inside the barrel of the weapon instead of the projectile),
the heat build-up is now a severe problem within the weapon itself
(imagine the heat from your old slot car set hand controllers and
multiply it a thousand fold :)

     Secondly, the quick chart telling what each tech level means hasn\'t been 
changed from CT either. They list TL9 = 1990s. I don\'t know about you, but 
I still haven\'t seen any 80s era TL8 gravcars.

     Lastly, they listed hydrosphere as 2D-7+Atmosphere. I remembered it as 
- -7+size, and sure enough that is how it was in CT. Was this changed in MT 
or TNE (being too lazy to dig either out).


BTW, M0 and FS finally came to my really F FNGS. I had them trained so well 
that as soon as I waled in the door, they handed it to me so I\'d get off  
 their backs about when it would arrive.

ahhh yes. M0 is simply great.

     I\'ve been bashing a SDB design around in my head, and I think I\'ll
put it into the Famille Spofulam product pipeline right after I get this
multi-barrel 18mm auto shotgun riot control weapon design done.  Basically,
I\'m thinking about a cluster of 5 or so PA gun spinal mounts, a bunch of
lasers, a meson gun, and 6G; the sort of thing that you\'d have for hunting
capital ships :).  Tentative class name is "Cauchemar".

     I\'ve also been thinking about upgunning the Crescent-class customs
vessel I designed a while back into an SDB; leave in the 6G T-plates and 3G
HEPlaR auxiliary drive and just rip out the jump drive and put in more guns
(possibly a second PA gun if it can be made to fit >:)).  A wing of those
escorting a Cauchemar or two would give just about anybody a bad day, I
thinK :).

Wellll, maybe.  For my own purposes, I\'d keep any psionics in the Templars
a verrrry deep secret.  And if they were to have these abilities to any
real degree, I wouldn\'t make them as obviously polarized as the Star Wars
Jedis.  There would probably be a few guru-like ones (ala Obi Wan or Yoda),
but these would be viewed as somewhat eccentric wise men by most of the
Templars, while those on the opposite end of the spectrum would be only
rumors... at least until they\'ve amassed enough power to come out of
hiding. :)

Talk about a leading question, Mike. Sure it\'s "possible" to include
psionics in a hard SF setting, just very difficult. Larry Niven was able to
pull it off by including psionics very sparingly for only subtle effects,
like the mass indicator used in starships. Unfortunately, many referees
can\'t resist creating powerful psionic effects to force the campaign in a
certain direction or to threaten the players.

The members of the TML are a pretty elite group of Traveller players, IMHO,
yet I constantly see posts suggesting massive psionic overkill to deal with
problem players or adventure dead-ends. The same idea occurs even more
quickly to novice referees. The problem is that this idea unbalances the
game, puts the players and referee in an adversarial situation, and only
encourages players to become even more ruthless (by using preemptive
strikes, getting their own psionic powers, or figuring how to turn the
powerful psionics against their enemies). I\'m speaking from experience; my
first campaign in High School included a starship full of
radiation-induced-psionic mutants. I devised my own rules for psionics
which unbalanced the game so much that about half my players wanted to be
mutants. I\'m not saying it was a bad campaign, it just wasn\'t a Third
Imperium campaign.

Another problem is that the more psionics gets used the more trite and
cliche it becomes. For example, psionic monsters have been overused to a
ridiculous extent and I think IG should automatically reject any adventures
that include them. It also becomes a short-cut adventure; why bother
thinking of a plot when you can just throw the psionic monster of the week
against the players?

For an example of what I mean, consider the recent thread about the referee
complaining his genocidal players exterminated an entire TL 0 village
because the natives threw some spears at them or something. Sure enough,
right away someone posted suggesting the referee create some TL 0
mega-psionic-mages to toast the players. The most likely outcomes of this
tactic are:

1: Players exterminate any suspicious-looking TL 0 characters BEFORE they
get a chance to throw anything at them.

2: Players kidnap or extort psionic-mages as living weaponry, turning the
campaign into Dungeons & Travellers (R)(TM).

Later, someone else came up with the idea of a secret society of nobles
sworn to protect the galaxy from riff-raff, or so they claim. This idea has
far more dramatic and play-balance potential.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if you create a sourcebook for
"systematic psionics", referees are going to use it. This makes it
important to keep the new rules play-balanced and avoid the urge to
\'improve\' on the existing psionic powers, which are in my opinion already
quite powerful.

I am not against the idea of including psionics in a campaign, in fact I
have it in my campaign. However, its effects are very random and subtle.
For example, in one adventure the players had to figure out if a fire
team\'s surprising defeat was because of psionics, chemical attack, or just
bad leadership. Making psionic effects ambiguous and rare is the best way
of keeping them mysterious.

This is a great idea, though I\'d add one thing...  If you think that
a given task is normally done by a skill-4 person, bump it all up a
notch, 2 notches if it normally takes a skill-5 person, etc..

I wish they had supported Diff-Level changes in addition to DMs in
T4 since it gives you a lot more options, and makes on the fly task
assignment easier.

Old theory but it is not being far from the galactic plane that is
dangerous but being close to it. When inside the galactic plane there are
lots of stars that pass close and those stars may perturb comets in Oorts
cloud that will come crashing into the solar system and some may hit earth
and kill off dinosaurs et c.

If you have the Black Globe on, sucking in energy and shunting it into the

The main point involved using the Black Globe to shield the ship from a 
planet\'s gravity well, he argued that gravity is just another form of 
energy, so at 10-100 diams it could suck gravitons and power the j-grid and 
jump, and the ship would be safe from the effects of the gravity well.

I am confused, I like this idea, and yet game ballance tells me to say the 
gravitons are so many that it would overload the caps and make ship go boom, 
now a white globe might be able to pull this off :)

Also I have read something in the MT Starships O.M. that densitomiters are 
grav sheilded, is it possible to grav shield a ship and therefore allow safe 
jumping at closer than 100 diams?

I have never liked this suggestion that Thruster Plates can only thrust
in one direction.  This might be an assumption in QSDS, but it is not
in SSDS.  SSDS doesn\'t talk about this at all.  Its really annoying
that people are talking about basic definitions after the rules have
been published.  

Anyway, I don\'t buy the argument, if ships with thrusters can only
thrust in one direction, how do they evade in combat.  The entire
combat system assumes, that ships make small turns, and jinx around, to
decrease their chance of getting hit. If you suppose that ships have
small thruster plates installed around the ship to allow them to do
this, then they should be able to use them to fly around a planet.  If
you suggest that ships have some other sort of micro rockets, this is
never mentioned in any of the design sequences. 

I like the idea as presented in SSDS, that contra-grav and Thrusters
plates, do the same thing, just contra-grav doesn\'t work outside of a
planet\'s gravity well.

Slight problem. To "see out" whether with eyes or sensors requires that
the radiation being used be allowed to travell *in*. As an example, if
light can only go out, but not in, then you cannot *see* from the
inside, but if there\'s enough illumination of the ship inside the
globe, people outside can see it! But a laser won\'t hit.

So it *cannot* be possible to "see out of" a white globe. You can send
signals out, you just can\'t receive.

More efficient isn\'t *always* a good idea. I recall a story where the
protagonist was field testing a new weapon. It damn near got him killed
because it was *too* efficient.

It was a sort of disintegrator. That is, you point it at something and
everything in fair sized conical volume quietly goes away. How did this
almost get him killed? Easy. Animals didn\'t have any reason to connect
the stuff vanishing with the person. So they were spooked, but not
afraid of *him*. Not a good combo.

Actually, any man portabable "gauss" weapon is *not* going to be using
coils. They\'ll be "railguns" not linacs.

A linac (linear accelerator) has a set of coils that get energized in
sequence so that the coils ahead of the projectile pull it and the ones
behind it push it. They are siometimes also refferred to as "coil guns".

This works great for mass drivers, but works *lousy* for even light
artillery. That\'s why most real world designs are railguns.

A railgun has *no* coils. And no switching circuitry. That along
simplifies it greatly.

What it has is a magnetic field (which can be supplied by "permanent"
magnets, as it never needs to change polarity). The field lines run
"vertical". That is, the "north" pole is "above" the barrel and the
"south" pole is "below" it.

There are also a pair of "rails" running the length of the barrel. They
carry DC voltage and can carry a *very* high current. The projectile
shorts across the rails. The result is that the current flowing left to
right in the "up" magnetic field produces a reaction force pushing it
"out" (forward). 

The force is constant and depends solely on the current flow and the
intensity of the magnetic field. Thus you get a constant, high
acceleration. 

I\'ve seen a projectile intended for use in such a railgun. It was 2 cm
square by about half a cm thick. It was some sort of fiber reinforced
glass or plastic. The fibers were conductive. They couldn\'t use metal
because it deformed too much under the acceleration and jammed.

They were using superconducting magnets and a few meters of rail. I
suspect that for a "rifle" you\'d go for higher currents so as to be
able to use "regular" permanent magnets. This limits the acceleration,
but it ought to still be pretty good (If we can find a source for the
magnets, I and a friend may try building one using the sort of magenets
you see advertised as "lift 200 pounds").

As you can see, a railgun is so simple that the military would love it.
A couple of long, narrow magnetic plates with a solid seperator, a
barrel drilled through the seperator, a couple of metal rails embedded
in the sides of the barrel. Plus a projectile feed and a power source. 

Pull the trigger and it feeds a "dart" into the "receiver" and pushes
it forward until it engages the rails. At that point, the current
starts and "zap"! The projectile zooms down the barrel. once the
current stops, that unlocks things to allow another dart to feed.

The magnet/spacer/rail assembly that makes up the barrel is not going
to need any maintenance other than running something thru the barrel to
clean out anything that might make a dart "stick". And the feed &
trigger assembly ought to be pretty simple as well.

Well...this is a prime example of exactly WHY PC\'s shouldn\'t get ahold of
such powerful toys!

The problem is NOT the effect of gravity upon the ship, but of gravity
upon the space in the vicinity of the ship, ie: jumping out where space is
at the curvature produced at less than 100 diameters produces
unstabilizing effects upon the transition to jump space. Now if your PC\'s
have a black globe that, saaay is the 100 diameter radius, well, they
could do that.

      But this puts me in mind of some teenage D&D player
bragging about his 64th level fighter/magic user defeating a god in single
combat...the game isn\'t quite balanced any more ;-)

     If your PC\'s do this anyway, make up a rule, like the use of black
globes in such a fashion triggers Grandfathers sensors in this universe,
and he comes back out, and takes the dangerous toys away from the little
hairless apes he infested this universe with.

     Simple--you change the direction the ship is pointing using the attitude
control system, which, for simplicity, is ignored in the design sequence.

     Some people have been going with the Starship Operator\'s Manual
suggestion, which I kind of like, that thrust plates work 100% in the right
direction, but you can slew the thrust if you\'re willing to give up some
efficiency. In other words, if you thrust straight front-to-back, the
output is 100%. If you thrust perpendicular to that, you get only 25%
output. And if you put it into reverse, you only get 10% output.

     Along with that went the idea that you could "overdrive" the thrusters for
very short (seconds to minutes) periods of time. So if you want to land
your Free Trader without having to stand it on its tail, by hovering
laterally, your engineer is down there in the engine room babying the
drives to 400% output. He can only do this for a few minutes before it go
BOOM!, but now you can direct 1G worth of thrust down the belly to land.

This is a great idea, though I\'d add one thing...  If you think that
a given task is normally done by a skill-4 person, bump it all up a
notch, 2 notches if it normally takes a skill-5 person, etc..

     I don\'t want to get into assiging tasks to specific characters. That\'s
too much trouble for me.  They wanted the rule.  I included it, but I
wanted it to be simple and across the board.  The problem arose when one
character with an 8 EDU spent his careers focusing on computers and
spent 7 skill points on them giving him an asset of 15.  Another
character spent his careers in Under-grad and grad schools and ended up
with a 14 EDU.  Now if he learns a computer skill (which he hasn\'t taken
yet) he will be equal with the guy who spent 7 points on computers. 
They didn\'t think that this was a fair rule.  So we instituted the +1,
+2 rule.  Thanks for your insight.

I would just do it across the board on  a task by task basis, nothing
to keep track of.  So a surgery task of brain surgery might require
a skill of Medical-4 (or 5) for a normal task.  Your PC medic would
do such a task at a harder diff level as you suggested (say she\'s
med-1, the task would be 3 or 4 diff-levels harder than the PC who
is a surgeon).

This would work for any skills you care to use.  It\'s just a
guideline for  you to assign tasks with is all.

I just use something like that to get a feel for how hard a task
_should_ be.  I think we\'re on the same page here, actually :-)

 Huh? Who wrote you can\'t play in the service? I\'ve always interpreted
"mustering out" or "failing" survival roll as the end of character
generation. Doesn\'t mean the character actually left, that\'s just where the
game starts. When I needed a navy crew, I generated them until they were at
the appropriate rank and experience for their position, and then started
playing. So if you want to play a Naval Commander, generate the character,
and go for it! >>

Leonard, I\'m shocked. You\'re the last person I\'d expect to get the
nomenclature backwards. "Population I" stars are the younger,
second-generation stars - like our own, which contain heavier elements.
"Population II" stars are the ancient, red, first-generation stars, which
are almost pure hydrogen and helium.

It *is* confusing though; the astronomers named things the wrong way
\'round. But I suppose they came up with the terms before there was a
coherent theory of star evolution, so they didn\'t know that the Population
II stars were the first generation.

Of course, I made a mistake myself in the posting quoted above: I said the
inter-arm regions were not much less dense than the arms, in terms of
Population I stars - which is true; but I shouldn\'t have brought the
Population I/II distinction into it - it\'s really not relevant here. What I
meant to say was that the arms are dense with very young, bright, hot
stars, the O and B types, and it\'s these that are relatively rare in the
inter-arm zones. Because they don\'t survive long enough to orbit into those
areas; they tend to go supernova not long after they leave their birth
regions, well before they leave the spiral arms.

Ah well. Nobody\'s prefect!

Prehaps I should\'ve included that in my post.  Psionics are extremely rare
in the Traveller universe, I was maybe thinking of a handful of people with
psionic ability but certainly not Jedi\'s.  There is no all-powerful force,
just "simple tricks and nonsense".  These templars aren\'t good or evil and
they don\'t have to fear the dark side.  When it all boils down these
templars are just mercenaries with an added twist or two.  

They don\'t have to pound out of control players into the ground they just
follow there own agenda (which doesn\'t necessarily include protecting TL-0
races - that was just a suggestion as was psionics).  I like this Templar
idea, think of it as another vehicle towards differing the style of
adventure, instead of a military style game politics, espionage, or mystery
could be emphasised.

And someone replied:
Could you  please post this variant for the rest of us?

Here are the basics=85 as the rules are not on file, and I use my own
system to figure out task, I will not post all the details. I have read
the RPSC v0.9 rules posted by Wildstar & Co. Very good set of rules, and
I will be using some for my version 5.0.  I post this in the hopes that
someone will find something they like and can use.=20

Bobs Basic Ship Combat System v4.9
Assumptions: I like ease of play. And I like detail. And I am not a gear
head with time to redesign ships every time Traveller changes systems.
In my big book of ships I have designs from Starships through High Guard
through MT through TNE. I have not played around with any of the ships
from T4. Lack of time. What this means is that any ship design can work
if I take a little time to convert the design into some basic stats. My
ships have Hit Points and my weapons do damage.=20

Conversions:=20
Figure out a ships hit points:=20
I use spreadsheet to do all of my calculations for me, but here are the
basics:

Hit Points (HP) =3D Integer (Square root of ship tonnage)  X (base 10
logarithm of ship tonnage)
=20
I think that is right. Here is an example of the results for basic
tonnage values:
Tons      HP
100  20
200  32
400  52
800  82
1600 128
3200 198
6400 304
12800     464
25600     705
51200     1065
102400    1603
=20
Tonnage doubles each time just to show the difference in hit points. As
you can see this calulation flattens the curve.

Now we need to figure out the effects of TL, Armor and Structure. I add
or subtract % points depending on a base.=20

Technology: In my game I figure tech 11 is about average, so that equals
one. For every tech above add ~10% to the HP values, reduce  by ~10% for
each tech level below.=20

Armor: What ever the base value is (for MT that is a 40) I add 1% for
each value above.

Structure: +/- 10-15 percent based on  type of hull. For example a open
frame would be -15%, Buffered asteroid +15%.

More examples:
1000 ton 1000 ton
TL8-15    TL12
AV40 AV40-85
68   103
77   115
85   128
94   141
103  154
111  167
120  205
128  218

On the left is a 1000 ton ships hit point from TL 8-15. Hit points go
from 68 to almost double at 128. The armor on the right has more of an
impact. Feel free to play around with the percentages if you think they
are too high.=20

Build a quick spreadsheet and enter the values and, presto, you have
damage points. I break the hit points into separate categories: Light
damage: 25%  Medium: 50%  Heavy: 75%  Critical: 90%  and Destroyed:
100%. Maneuver and Jump capability is reduced as damage reaches each
level. I usually apply the same present to drive numbers and round to
nearest. In addition cost and timing factors for repair is tied to each
level.

Now we to figure out the weapon factors. Simple. I base it on the High
Guard figures. Factors ranging from 1-A and spinal mounts A - ??.

Game Play:

1. Determine Range: Any system will work. Here is an updated one I did
quickly. =20
=20
1D Roll   Range
0, or less     V. Short
1    Short
2    Short
3    Medium
4    Medium
5    Long
6    Long
7+   Very Long

Friendly Condition       Modifier
Active Sensors           +1
Passive Sensors               --
Running Cold             -1

Target Condition         Modifier
Active Sensors           +2
EM Masking               -1
Running Cold             -2
V. Small Target (1-99 tons)             -1
Small Target (100-999 tons)             --
Medium Target (1000-99Ktons)            +1
Large Target (100Ktons+)           +2

Black Globes:=09
Flickering     +3
Full on   +2

If only one ship detects the other, you may have suprize. Sometimes the
PC can change their status and escape detection.

After range I use task rolls to determine if a PC ship can open or close
range.=20
For example =20
Both want to open or close: Easy Task, move one range band.
Competitive roll if one wants to open vs close: Difficult.
If the roll fails range stays the same.
Modifiers are difference in maneuver drives used, sensor technology,
etc.

Some G points can be used for evasion if so desired. Agility acts as the
skill in my game.

I like to have more interaction in my games so I tend to use a open
ended system. This allows me to shape the results slightly and balance
play.

However, I like detail. And damage is where that comes in.=20
The RPSC system seems like a good place to figure out your to hit task.
I use my house system, but I am playing around with Kv2.0 for task
rolls. (keep up the good work Ken)

If you hit, roll 1D6 on the chart below. Weapon factor is across the
top.


1D6   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A+   Spinal

Modify the die role by the range and weapon type from the chart below:

Range     Beams     Missiles  Hi Energy Meson Gun Part. Acc.
Boarding  +2   +2   +4   +4   +2
Very Short     +1   +2   +4   +4   +2
Short     0    +2   +1   +4   +1
Medium    0    +2   -2   +4   -1
Long -2   +2   -4   +4   -2

Spinal mounts do their Factor * 10 in additional damage. Example: a
factor G =3D 160 additional points.

BOOM. The weapon hits, figure damage, and now we see if we got any
critical hits.

Figure out the damage ration:
Damage Ratio: Total Damage received in a turn is divided by the
remaining damage points.=09
Ratio =3D Damage received that turn divided by (Damage remaining - Damage
received that turn)

That gives you a ratio. Apply that ratio to the chart below:

Ratio\\Die 1    2    3    4    5    6
Less than .1   0    0    0    0    0    0

I\'ve been following this Templar discussion with some interest, as I am a
Grand Lodge officer of Ordo Templi Orientis, a group whose name and
symbolism derives from the Knights Templar.  Thus, I feel it incumbent on
me to set the record straight.

The Knights Templar were founded in the Holy Land, circa AD 1108, by a
group of 11 French knights and nobles.  Their stated purpose was to guard
pilgrims in the Holy Land.  The King of Outremer (Baldwin II, as I recall)
granted them quarters on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the site of King
Solomon\'s Temple (hence the name they chose for their order).

Throughout the 12th century the Templars gained numbers, power, and
influence.  They were renowned as extraoridnary fighters.  At a time when
most European \'armies\' were semi-organized mobs, they were a coordinated,
tightly drilled force of highly trained warriors, who knew how to employ
both tactical and strategic analysis to win encounters in which they were
massively outnumbered.

There are very persistent myths, which originated as the Templars gained
in prestige, that the knights of this order were secretly initiated into
Saracen (Arab) religious mysteries, perhaps even those of the Assassins. 
This was in all likelihood the sort of wild rumor that attaches to any
powerful and secretive group, but there are shreds of historical evidence
which support the idea.  By the way, the original Knights of the Grail
myth, Parsifal, was inspired when the author (blanking on the name, sorry)
saw Templars in action at a siege near Cairo.

When the Kingdom of Jerusalem was overrun by the Saracens, the Templars
found themselves without an (official) purpose.  They had massive wealth,
and well-fortified keeps near most major European trade centers.  They
became quasi-mercenaries, and also bankers(!), inventing the first crude
checking-account system (deposit gold at Templar fort A, get encoded
certificate, withdraw it at Templar fort B).

In time, the Templars became truly staggeringly wealthy, attracting the
avarice and fear of European nobility and high clergy.  King Phillip of
France finally crushed the Templars and siezed their assets in a sudden,
brutal campaign, killing many members of the Order (including the Grand
Master) and forcing the rest to flee or go into hiding.  Tracking where
these latter knights ended up has been one of the most popular conspiracy
theorist games for the last five centuries; the Masons and Rosicrucians
both rank high in most theories.

   I remember that message you sent; it got me to read Saberhagen\'s
   novel "Berserker Base", and was one of the reasons the name "Templar"
   jumped into my head when I started talking about a holy order of
   knights.  Sad to say, I know more about Saberhagen\'s Templars than I
   do about the historical ones.  I once heard of an order of knights
   that protected pilgrims who travelled about Europe in the middle
   ages and who were subject to horrible violence from well armed
   a**holes who were willing to exploit them.  I think they were called
   the hospitallers (please, anyone who knows any real midieval history,
   feel free to jump in).  The idea of defending the defenseless made me
   think of Traveller, and the damage that a bunch of well-armed players
   can do to a low-pop or low-tech world.

   It seems to me that in the absence of any protection from the state,
   semi-private organizations like this will always crop up to "keep the
   peace".  Their founding charisms will be either altruistic or
   "enlightened" self-interest, but like all powerful organisations,
   they will not be immune to corruption or abuse.  The more powerful
   they get, the more likely they are to attract power-hungry
   individuals.  Marc\'s comment about the Imperium\'s reluctance to
   pursue interstellar justice (in the "extradition" subject line) got
   me thinking that, if they\'re not doing it, someone else is.  And that
   sounded like a fun adventure hook to me!

   Note that, if the state is not enforcing some kind of monopoly on
   justice, then there will inevitably be more than one of these
   organisations.  Some of these orders will be on friendly terms with
   each other, others will not...

You want to sheild the ship from the source of the energy?  That takes all

Good point about the effect of gravity on the space around the ship,
  in addition to the effect on the ship.  But a 100 diameter black globe
  wouldn\'t absorb the energy directed at the ship from inside the sphere.

Actually, I\'d be more inclined to tell the player that the idea works, but
  not necessarily inform them (unless their player had some knowledge of
  the physics involved, or bothered to ask someone about the problem)
  what the effects on the jump drive would be.  This is Traveller, not
  D&D, so what the ref should have to enforce game balance is "physics".
  Sure, the black globe can absorb gravitons--but what happens when it
  does is the main point.

Of course, in the MT ref\'s book, the phrase is "If a ship absorbs enough
  energy to make a jump and is supplied with sufficient fuel...", so
  appearantly the gravitons would only be enough to jump start the jump 
  drive (no pun intended) and not actually complete the jump.  But then
  again, what happens to people with anti-matter power plants and jump
  drives?

The solution really is to let the players attempt to fill the capacitors
  in a gravity well, and then try to jump.  Since they\'re still inside
  the gravity well (and strictly speaking the ship would have to drop
  the black globe to release the energy to jump, probably), they\'d be
  in for a massive misjump.  This of course assumes that the capacitors
  didn\'t overload from the gravitons since there would be an incredible
  amount of energy being directed into the ship very rapidly.  So,
  you\'d have to time the moment of jump such that it started when the
  ship had enough energy, and complete the jump before the capacitors
  overloaded.  Nothing like a little excitement for the astrogator
  and engineering crew....and it doesn\'t have to stop even there.

And for really jaded players, what about ramming black globed ships into
  suns?  Even more energy to play with.  Oh, and if the players are jumping
  from a planet with an atmosphere, you might want to add in even more
  energy (greater time constraints) from pressure.

In short, don\'t tell them no, they can\'t do it.  Tell them yes, they can.
  And if you\'re feeling nice, or they\'re suspicious enough, then they\'ll
  find out what happened to the last person who tried it.  But don\'t stop
  them if they think they have it all worked out--just be prepared to
  explain to them the factors that their character forgot to compensate for.

Actually, what I meant by "efficient" was that the *design* of
the weapon was efficient, not the method by which that weapon
delivers damage.  For example, an incandescent lightbulb may be
an efficient way of providing cheap illumination to different
rooms of your house, but the design itself wastes a lot of energy
and is, therefore, inefficient.

Considering that recoil still has to be managed in some--
possibly energy consuming-- way, would such a design be a more or
less efficient method of delivering "damage" than a laser weapon
powered using the same power source?

  Many thanks Sir Gridlore for this fine trophy. I am very pleased to have
been awarded this prize. My thanks also to Dr Clark for his kind words. As
suggested we will be investigating the installation of meson technology for
any interested customers.

  One question I have to ask though, why does the rock have the inscription

So we make the detonator part of the strip inert until a small electic
charge or 
some such is ran through it....Say, slap the tape down and then press the 3I\'s
equivalent of a 9-volt battery against it.

We know that the Emperor used clones, as did the ranking nobles of the
Imperium. The use of clones by the Emperor and Norris is revealed in the MT
supplement "Arrival Vengeance" and the TNE/MT supplement "Survival Margin".
Neither have any rules on the use of clones.

I suspect that the Solomani are likely to be the source of most clones -
Solomani and Aslan mentions the edge that they have genetic engineering
(the profile of Terra gives a \'G\', ie tech level 16 rating in this
respect). It also mentions Wuan Technology association - "They studied,
modified and standardised human genotypes. Now, the Wuans can produce
specialised humans suited for any task or environment. A visitor to Wuan
factories will see long rows of identical workers performing the same
industrial task."

I think the key to clones is that they should have near identical STR, DEX,
END, and possibly INT. But EDU and SOC should vary with task and training.
Of course, if you are looking for the excessive abilities shown by
replicants in Bladerunner, why not generate using 2d6+3 or just pick the
stats.

I recommend the book "Cyteen" by CJ Cherryh. It goes into depth on cloning
like nothing else I\'ve read, and ties it to a excellent political Sci-Fi
thriller.

According to a Classic Traveller supplement entitled "Fighting Ships,"
however, the bulk of the Imperial navy seemed to consist of Tech Level 15
vessels - Tech Level 14 \'Azhanti High Lightning\' cruisers were described
as being "obsolete." I don\'t have the book with me as I type this, so that
may not be the exact word, but I definitely got the feeling that the
Imperium has more than enough Tech Level 15 warships to put all of its
Tech Level 14 ones in mothballs, or on safe, "backwater" patrol routes.
In short, Tech Level 15 isn\'t "cutting edge."  Personally, I\'d guess the
Third Imperium\'s ABSOLUTE upper technological limit was the borderline
between Tech Levels 16 and 17, but only on a hand-made, single-item,
hideously expensive, double top secret basis (and even then, probably not
in *every* area, hence the need for those Research Stations)

I\'ve always assumed that "battle dress" is a Tech Level 12 item because
that\'s when a tactical computer clever enough to feed the wearer the right
information at the right time becomes practical.  Presumably, "powered
armor," without much of the extensive sensors and communication equipment
that really makes real battle dress *worthwhile*, would be possible at
Tech Level 9 or 10.

Yes, I had thought the G-well was more space-time warping than an actual

Sounds like an interdiction field to me, but there are such things a

Well, to a point. But some ship systems and structures are "squishy" too;
computer systems (I don\'t know the current "canon" hardware design for a
holodynamic computer terminal but I\'d assume it\'s rather delicate), being the
most obvious. Imagine you drive your RW car with a PC, like Doom or sumpn. Now,
blast that PC with a shot gun a couple of times. Now, try and avoid that truck

sixteen inches. Wasn\'t much left for din-din... Given the normal range of rabbit
encounters, a 7.62 would be as dangerous to the user as the lapine, with the

limpet mines on battledress (like, pit of the back out of reach), and how easy
is it to knock out the power pack/computer system, leaving the battledress

We tend to deflect the first one (after a good laugh at the mental picture) with
the handwave of "cerametal" armour nicked from Julian May, but the second
continues to bother me. There\'s no given info to suggest how feasible it is.
Anyone got any take?

  Hmm, interesting point. To take the example of the TL15 Meson gun listed,
you ignore the VS range as it is too short. So in combat terms your damage
at range is

Range    VS  S   M  L
Damage   20  10  5  0
USP       1   0  0  0

Then looking at the ROF, a ROF of 10 should, according to a message supplied by
Wildstar, be subject to a -1 mod, so we get 0-0-0-0. Useless, as you say!

  Perhaps we need to have a look at FFS and check the designs of these. They
don\'t exactly strike fear into the hearts of the enemy do they!

Can _you_ be programmed?  Sorry, I guess all this cloning crap in
the news has it on my mind... a clone is a twin, that\'s it.  Not a
zombie, not property, a twin.  There is nothing otherwise wierd
about clones.  They\'ll look like the "parent" but that is it.  They
would have totally different personalities (though they would share
any genetically predisposed traits.

Is there a huge market for slaves that are self-breeding without
test tubes at TL16?  This makes no sense.  Who could possibly
imagine any system of law saying that a twin is a non-citizen to be
done with as you please.  Can you harvest your kid\'s organs at TL16
if you wish (from a legal standpoint)?

Cloning would be cheap, but then again so is making a human the old
fashioned way.  The only possible "market" for clones might be for
using their organs----and it would be as illegal as it would be to
take organs from somebody without permission now.

I\'d think that it\'s a total non-issue by high TLs since they might
be able to clone just the organ without making a person (which would
make it impossible to take away without assaulting a human).

Recoil depends on the mass of the dart, and the muzzle velocity. So
it\'s no harder to manage than for a firearm with the same mass*velocity
of the projectile. Note that this is *momentum, *not* "muzzle energy"!

It\'s likely *more* efficient than a laser, as a laser needs several MJ
to do much damage to a human. And it has one *big* advantage over a
rifle at Traveller tech levels. The darts merely have to be metal and
somewhat conductive. So as long as you stick to performance in the same
league as a good military rifle, you can make them of any old hunks of
scrap metal you have handy.

Powercells recharge from vehicle power supplies. So the "logistics
train" for a gauss rifle amounts to a "truck" (modified grav APC?) with
an armorer\'s workroom in it. *Simple* RUGGED tools will turn scrap
metal into darts (if you run low) and power is there as long as the
fusion plant runs.

So a platoon (that\'s the unit between squad and company isn\'t it?)
should be able to operate independently for a *long* time. Which
mercenaries and special forces types will *love*. The guns are rugged,
very little that can\'t be fixed by the armorer, and ammo is effectively
free. 

Lasers would be better except that when dealing with man portable
units, you get more damage to a human by using a projectile with 1 MJ
than a 1 MJ pulse from a laser. And the projectile doesn\'t ionize the
air leaving a "here I am" pointer! Lasers *do* at weapons level power
outputs[1]. 

As heavy weapons the lasers beat projectile weapons. But for "small
arms" the projectile is king.

1. someday I have to dig out an article on lasers and scan in the
picture of a laser beam ionizing the air. It looks like a cheap special
effect!

A certain teleporting Droyne in my campaign loves using the first option
against enemy targets: teleport behind them, stick on a shaped charge,
teleport away, and telekinetically "flick" the detonator (which is inside
the totally sealed bomb). Ouch. BTW, doesn\'t matter if the armour isn\'t
metal (although "canon" suggests that it is superdense or bd): just use some
instant glue. If you are mean, roll to see if the Droyne sticks himself to
the armour _as well_; he may want to teleport away with no clothes (so much
for the triply-expensive Droyne battledress he was wearing).

As for the second, my vague memory says that the Trav Digest article
mentioned that suits could "freeze up" (especially moving parts such as
joints) after being hit by fire. However, this was in the descriptive part
of the article - no rules were ever given. Why not say that a major
penetration (in whatever system you are using) requires a roll on the Robot
tables to see what was damaged, and therefore a roll to make that limb
useless, or the hearing dead, or cause a malfunction in a vital system such
as waste recycling. For example, I know I wouldn\'t want to be in one of
those things if the computer went haywire - although a picture of
battledress doing a marionette-like dance might be funny to watch. "Close
the door, Virgil". "FAB, Dad!"

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well, citing back to \'Cyteen\' (which isn\'t Traveller canon, but is one of
the best treatments of cloning I\'ve seen in a novel), you can create near
identical clones, but they do that by controlling all the stimulation and
training that they get during training (\'tape training\'). It\'s more of a
brainwashed conditioning. Arguably, that\'s what you see with Deckard and
Rachel in Bladerunner. Once you have the clone out of a controlled
environment, they will change. (Another novel by Cherryh springs to mind
\'40000 on Gehenna\'). IMO, this is what the Wuans have done. (NB - may
references to Cyteen are done with through the mist of three years - I\'ve
yet to replace it since one of my house mates (a biochemist!) dropped it in
the bath!)

<<The best cloning that can be had is "generic" humans
at TL-16.>>

No, you can clone specific humans - Seldarian (a female clone of Archduke
Norris) is an example. I suspect that cloning starts at lower tech levels,
particularly as the Wuans are noted as developing the technology during the
Long Night. Additionally (**MT background spoiler warning - don\'t read the
rest of para if you don\'t want to risk it**) we know from Survival Margin
that some pretty good clones must exist, as Strephon\'s was assassinated by
Dulinor *and very few people knew the truth of the matter.

<< I may have to write my own rules on this, because we, in
1997, have already developed cloning to a degree.  I would think that by
TL-16 there would be a huge market for clones, even they would be
incredibly expensive (somewhere in the 10\'s of MCr\'s).>>

Cloning comes up against the Imperiums endorsement of the rights of all
sentient life forms to be considered Imperial citizens. Now if that is the
case, a clone is enslaved. Article VI of the Warrant of Restoration cites
this a prohibited. However, this is canon Third Imperium, and doesn\'t stop
your own version of Traveller having cloning as legal. Otherwise, the
market is going to be restricted. It is one of those things that the Vilani
(boo! hiss!) are going to use to condemn the Solomani.

I agree on the high cost - they should be the preserve of mega-corps, high
nobles and governments, much like top end synaptic processing robots.

When I\'ve had clones in a scenario (yes, a bladerunner clone some years
ago) I just maxed out the physical characteristics at F (15) in MT. Hope
that helps...

    'body' => 'In response to recent posts stating there\'s no future for cloning in the
far future:


Cloning has many interesting uses in the Traveller universe...and not just
from the Boys-from-Brazil-Adolph-Hitler clone perspective.

1.  One may breed or genetically engineer an exceptional adaptable plant or
animal and then clone it to produce mass populations.

For example, it\'s not easy to breed wolves into dogs or to make seedless
orange trees.  It\'s not easy to geneticallly engineer an animal that can
live in highly corrosive atmospheres.  But once viable specimens are
produced, they can be cloned, reproduced and propagated en masse.
Remember:  it is indeed more difficult to genetically engineer an organism
than it is to clone it.

These techniques can be used to terraform a planet or to assist in its
colonization.

Adventure Hook:  The characters may be responsible for finding suitable
animals for the scientists to modify (a la CT Adventure Safari Ship) or
dealing with the genetic experiments gone awry (Aliens-meets-Frankenstein).

2.  Jurrasic Park scenario.  So you want to make a sixty-five million year
old animal from fragmentary DNA?  Once you get enough animal DNA from
mosquito blood trapped in amber and substitute frog DNA for the missing
stuff, you\'ll have enough to make your own velociraptor.  But you\'re going
to need to clone that \'raptor; it\'s unlikely that you unearthed enough DNA
to produce a viable population of individuals.

Why would you create and then clone a creature from fragemntary DNA?

Say you\'re trying to bring back extinct animal "B" that was the natural
predator of currently out-of-control animal "A."  (a la the CT adventure
"Horde").

Say you\'re trying to bring back animal "C," whose organs could be pulped
into the cure for space-ebola sickness.  (The scientist character finds a
clue to the current plague in a First Empire Exploration Record.  An animal
in another subsector, now extinct, provided a cure to a similar plague
9,000 years ago.  The party goes to find fossil of the animal (or museum
specimens) to clone).

Say you\'re trying to bring back animal "D" (for dinosaur) as part of your
"Six Flags Over Sylea Amusement Park."

Cloning would offer a good way to mass produce those animals.

3.  Colonization.

I think it reasonable that the totalitarian Solomani would take a genetic
smaple from each citizen (much like a fingerprint is done today).  With
that information, they can clone people (the "right" people) to their
hearts content.

During colonization efforts, cloned eggs will be kept in storage on mother
ships and "hatched" when the ship lands.   Twenty-years later you can have
a 1,000,000 person strong colony without the expense of shipping 1,000,000
people.

(Scenario is from the Solomani and Aslan Alien Module).

4.  Organs.

I am not suggested cloning people for their organs!

I\'ve read of this scenario being promulgated by scientists.  The pig\'s
immune system most closely mirrors the human\'s immune system.  Let\'s say
you genetically engineer a pig by adding the human genes for immunity.
Now, hypothetically, one can transplant the pig\'s organs to a human and
have the organ be accepted as a human organ due to the presence of human
immunoreceptors.  I clone the pig so everyone can have organ transplants.
I may have some of the sceince wrong, but you see the principle.

"Fire, Fusion and Steel" is just part of the advances in future technology.
There\'s room for biology, too!

<< In the Falklands War, the Gurkha kukri blade was also a psychological 
peration.  The Argentine troops at one point expressed their concern over 
facing the Gurkhas, and the locals started telling them stories of how the 
Gurkhas would typically infiltrate an encampment at night and behead every 
sleeping enemy:  "It\'s easy to tell if a Gurkha has paid a visit.  When you 
get up in the morning, turn your head.  If your head falls off, you\'ve had a 
Gurkha."  I read about this in Newsweek or Time soon after the war. >>

I *really* like the Gurkhas, they\'re just incredible (think terminators with a 
sense of humour...) I\'m gonna have to bring them into my campaign somehow.

No, SEPERATE.  As in not in contact with each other until it is time to go
boom.  The reason for this is to insure that there is no way for an
accidental detonation.

In my expereince, every care is taken to keep the detonator and explosive as
far as possible from each other until it is time for the demolition.  then,
and only then, are the two mated.

Question:  It\'s always been my understanding that a gauss rifle would have a
lower recoil due to the fact that the is accelerated over the length of the
barrel, not suddenly by the explosion of a powder charge.  Am I
misunderstanding something?

Based on my work with 3G3, I\'d have to agree.. Railguns out perform lasers
of the same power/weight.

Certainly makes logistics easier to handle.  I could imagine that a
point-defence unit equipped with VRF Gauss weapons would have one of these
shops for every three or four gun sleds.

Platoon is the step between squad and company.  Platoons, however, are
manuver units; they tend not have any sort of "support" vehicles attached.
You would probably find these armorers\' vehicles attached at the battalion
level, as part of the supply force.

I seem to recall that we discovered that the railgun version of the Intrepid
grav tank kicked ass over the fusion version... have to look up the comparison.

FF&S, page 59:
"...white globes were tuned to allow certain narrow wavelengths through.
These are usually wavelengths which are not particularly useful for
weaponry, particularly space-based weaponry.  White globe-equiped ships
thus tend to rely heavily on infrared wavelength radiation for sensors and
make extensive use of masers for tight beam communications."

I hear ya. I started running T4, but at the time I had no background, so I was forced to 
bump my players to an era where I did have info. And since I was already using the MT 
task system, I rarely even look at the books now.

Actually, I think the problem with cloning is the typical usage versus the
  narrow definition.  The simplest form of cloning is what we have now--
  the ability to create genetically identical organisms.  Unfortunately
  (or fortunately, depending on your perspective) the common usage of cloning
  is to create a copy which is not only genetically identical but which is
  of the desired physiological development and has already accumulated
  knowledge identical (or atleast equivalent) to the original.
After all, even if a scientist decides to create 500 genetically identical
  sheep in some laboratory somewhere, the scientist still has to wait for
  normal physiological development.  So, the standard sci-fi cloning issue
  would involve regular cloning, followed by accellerated development of the
  tissue, and topped off by either memory implantation or speed learning
  (take your pick).  Get all that accomplished, and then you have your
  "cloning" ability.  
But then again, its the same problem for mass producing artificial 
  intelligences as for mass producing clones.  There really are easier and
  better (not to mention less resource intensive) ways to do all this
  (not that it stops anyone).
Oh, and don\'t forget about the tissue development involved (after all,
  weight lifters don\'t get massive muscles by being born with them) to get
  the cloned invidivual prepared for its role.  So maybe the TL16 version
  is so advanced because it involves all of the above issues, and not
  simply out of designer errors.

No, they would become water vapor, one of the major problems with Venus now.
Venus would need some seriously hardy plant-like "thingys" to remove the

A few more reasons why I\'ve used space stations (of varying sizes, up to 
O\'Neil Colony LaGrange Point type sized worldlets...):

Service large solar-power collectors
Industry in space (smelting ores from the Belt)
Isolation of dangerous experiments...or dangerous transhipped cargo! 
(Alien, anyone?)
Because we **like living here**!

We know the Imperium of the Classic Trav period used space stations of 
fairly large sizes. Look at how many Downports had linked Upports! Or 
better yet, look at Glisten in the Spinward Marches...Type A Spaceport, 
Naval Base, Scout Base, nexus of four jump routes...

Sounds like my kind of place!

In working on my Classic Traveller Spinward Marches campaign, I\'ve been 
thinking about maps. Of course, I\'ve got the (in)famous map of the 
Marches--in Classic, Rebellion and New Era versions. However, I started 
fiddling with the maps in Supplement Three in order to be able to do some 
coding myself using colored pencils. I photocopied the maps, cut them out 
and taped them together. Interestingly, either the photocopier I used or 
the maps themselves are slightly distorted--as some sectors don\'t quite 
mesh! In any case, a few hours work with tape, scissors and pencils and 
I\'ve got a Spinward Marches map on my closet door that shows major groups 
(Imperium, Zhodani, SW, Darrians, etc.), Amber Zones, Red Zones, water 
worlds, etc...and trading routes. For example, the whole "Spinward Main" 
is outlined as are the Towers Cluster, the Kinorb Run, the Mainz Line and 
the Edenelt Cluster. 

I\'m now in the process of making a series of player maps, using the 
smaller 8.5x11 maps found in books like GDW\'s Spinward Marches Campaign 
(the post-FFW adventure). I\'m looking for ideas of what I should 
highlight on each. I figure one map per theme, e.g., one map showing all 
A class starports, one highlight jump routes, etc. This would work with 
my Trader-oriented Library Data to help the player\'s plan their routes. 
I\'m intentionally limiting them to a J1 ship--either one that only has J1 
engines or one with a higher class of drive that--through neglect--is 
limited to J1 (see Twilight\'s Peak for where I got this from). I want to 
start them "poor", but leave them an out so they can upgrade...either by 
replacing the engines or doing things like adding external tanks (and no, 
I don\'t want to start that debate again!). Maps I\'ve come up with so far 
have been:

Red Zones (interdicted...but the big question is: Do I let them know 
***why*** these worlds are interdicted??????)
Amber Zones
Jump Routes
Political boundries (Imperium, Imperium allied states, Sword Worlds, 
Vargr, Darrians, unaligned states)
Water worlds
A starports...B starports...through a map of worlds with E starports...
Imperial Navy Bases
Scout bases
Non-imperial navy/scout bases
Worlds over xxxx in pop
Worlds under xxxx in pop
Gas giants
Asteroid belts
Jump route map
"Official" trade route maps, e.g., which worlds Oberlides visits, the 
Aramis subsector lines, etc.
"Unoffical" trade route maps, e.g., all the J1 clusters like the Spinward 
Main
Legends...the only one I\'ve got so far is "The Abyss" from a Challenge 
article about the space around Victoria/Sonthert/Ylaven where...according 
to the author...the pirates may lurk...

As they get deeper into the Marches I may produce new maps to show the 
stages of various Frontier Wars, the extent of the old Darrian 
Confederation, the extent of the devastation caused by the Darrians, 
Chirper Worlds, Droyne Worlds, worlds where traces of Aslan or Varry or 
others have been found...

I\'m open to suggestion: Any other items I should highlight on these maps? 
Remember that we are dealing with the "Classic" era, so I can\'t go too 
far into the future...no viral pathways, for example...

I\'m working on my Classic Traveller campaign set in the Spinward =
Marches (hey...The Spinward Marches Campaign...). It\'s set to start =
in the early days (1105 onwards) so that I can have the players catch =
the Fifth Frontier War and all that good stuff.

Lately I\'ve been scouring various sources to build up the Library =
Data. Not only do I intend to use the canonical Library Data from =
GDW, but anything I can adapt from Travellers\' Digest, MegaTrav =
Journal, High Passage and others.

Another source, of course, is science fiction itself. For example, =

Interplanetary Expeditions. Those of you who follow B5 as closely as =
I do will recognize that corporation...(I\'m also trying to find the =

Written science fiction will also provide a wealth of ideas. Now, =
just because something is in my Library Data doesn\'t make it "real". =
Also stuffed in here will be rumors, legends and downright lies. =
Since I intend to run a merchant-oriented campaign, and my thinking =
on the merchants has been heavily influenced by Andre Norton, Poul =
Anderson and a few others, rumors and legends are mandatory! How else =
do you make that Big Strike that allows you to retire to Capital/Core =
and live in style.

I\'m currently re-reading Andre Norton\'s Sargasso of Space, the first =
in her series on the Free Trader Solar Queen (the other books in the =
series are Voodoo Planet--usually found in a double edition with Star =
Hunter--a book unconnected to the series, Postmarked the Stars, =
Plague Ship--one that I\'ve lost, if anybody ever comes across a =
second hand edition, please give me a shout!, and a new =
volume--co-written with P.M. Griffin, Redline the Stars...Griffin and =
Norton are coming out with a sequel to Redline sometime this year, =
called something like "Spaceship for Sale"). In re-reading this book, =
I\'m convinvced that the folks at GDW must of been influenced by =
Norton\'s writing as well. We have Free Traders, of roughly the same =
crew size as the ships we all know and love. A lot of Norton\'s books =
share common elements that would fit into Traveller--the Galactic =

my Library Data. I should have started doing this last year when I =

Well, easy enough to do, and accurate in the sense that the original
Templars were a group of crusading knights.  The only small correction was
that the Templars were founded and began their operations in Jerusalem
rather than Europe.

By the way, someone else mentioned the Hospitallers, another knightly
order of the time.  They were, as that post indicated, founded with a
similar goal to the Templars -- protecting pilgrims, in their case in
Europe.  The Hospitallers are thought to have absorbed many ex-Templars
following Phillip\'s treachery.

Oh, by all means!  If you have the Templars guarding against some specific
external threat (the Vargr, perhaps, or one of the pocket empires) as a
major part of their mission, spending large chunks of their time in
\'enemy\' territory during periods of uneasy truce, and if you set up some
religious or mystical system (a special brand of psionics?) as a known
part of this \'enemy\' culture...well, then it\'s easy to imagine our modern
Templars attracting the same sort of wild rumors as plagued the originals.

Additionally, when high-ranking Templar survivors were brought before
religious courts of inquiry following the destruction of the Order, they
are reputed to have confessed to worshipping a deity named \'Baphomet\' and
a relic called \'Caput LVIII M" (or possibly \'Virgo\' rather than \'M\'), a
metal rendering of a male human head.  The latter was never accounted for,
though all the bastions of the Order were looted by Phillip and others. 
This would make a fine Ancient artifact in the updated version.

Yes, this would make a lot of sense.  In a way, the Templars\' banking
system paved the way for the Renaissance, by making capital far more
liquid than previously.  Oddly enough, the Black Plague was probably the
other major trigger...but that\'s another story. :)

My thought exactly.  One lovely final twist to the tale, to help set this
tone:  When Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Templars, was
being prepared for burning at the stake in Paris, he is said to have
pronounced a terrible curse on the royal lineage of King Phillip.  Within
a year, Phillip and many influential members of his court were dead, along
with the Pope who had assisted in betraying the Templars.

However, the *really* cool part didn\'t happen until more than four
centuries later.  When King Louis XVIII of France (direct lineal
descendant of old Phillip) was guillotined, a voice from the crowd shouted
"Jacque de Molay, thou art avenged!"  It appears Templars have *long*
memories, and *lots* of patience...

In campaigns I\'ve played in, BD was a ceramic composite of a non-ferrous
nature. Magneticly placed mines wouldn\'t work in this case.  However, a
player in that campaign came up with the idea of an adhesive attached
explosive device.  Not very pratical as he wasn\'t able to get close
enough to attach the device.

As far as the power pack and such goes, these are protected.  So you
can\'t really take them out. Some sort of AP rounds were the preferred
methodology...

How, pray tell would this ever happen? :-)  I can\'t see that
happening, it isn\'t in the genes, so it won\'t express itself in the
clone.  I agreee with your first point, most people don\'t really
seem to know what a clone _is_.

Then you have something that is beyond cloning.  What we have now
_is_ cloning, any addition of memory or some such goofiness is not
cloning, it\'s something else.  Maybe psionics could do some kind of
memory implantation, that is a good bet for traveller since it
involves the least science nullification (since psi already
nullifies for us :-)

Speed learning will make a learned adult, but won\'t make a copy of a
"normal" person (though all the speed learned people would share
similar experiences so they\'d be sort of alike, even if they didn\'t
have their parent\'s personality.

That would be a good solution. But this solution would partially cleared

Actually, I don\'ty have any rule. But the recent explorations in the
cloange domaine in England show that\'s doesn\'t seem too hard to clone at
TL8. So we can easily imagine that at TL10 it is easy to clone someone.
Let\'s say as easy as in vitro fecondation today. 

The problem is not the is not the scientific difficulties. The main problem
should be ethics and by consequences _laws_.
Another question is "What are the clone for?". Is it a way to create new
people? Is it a way to create better troops (not pure clones but
modificated ADN)? Is it a way to have replacement organs for the orginal
(freezed organ bank)? Is it a way to get doubles for security? What would
be the social status for the clones? Does they have to be easily recognized?

Now if you want to know if it\'s possible to create a same age double in
several monthes (like accelerating grossing) I would say : choose as you want!

Some of those point could be authorized or well accepted on some planets of
totaly rejected on others. You can either legally forbid them or let the
player having 6 clones :-) (Oh no, don\'t shoot, I did\'t betray the yellow
accreditation guy, ...zblam!...)

What I was actually referring to is that conventional firearms
use muzzle brakes or gas actions to reduce recoil.  Since
railguns or mass drivers do not deal with expanding gases to
propel its ammunition, other methods would have to be utilized to
reduce recoil to a manageable level.  In a high tech society I
would imagine that some form of inertia-reduction technology
would need to be used, thereby increasing the energy requirements
for the weapon even more.

My initial point about recoil stemmed from the 9 pound TL12
linear accelerator pistol design (with a 15cm muzzle and a muzzle
velocity of 1,500 m/s) that was submitted to the list.  That\'s a
terrible amount of recoil to deal with all at once!  Since FF&S
only lists gyroscopic stabilization (not really recoil
management) and stock-mounted recoil pads (not applicable to a
pistol design), I began wondering what the recoil might be like.

If the technology were to exist to negate that recoil, it would
require *at least* the same energy used to propel the projectile.
And that\'s assuming 100% efficiency for both the weapon and the
recoil management mechanism.

Surely a QB sneak is more like "The enemy know we\'re here, they know

Total recoil would still be the same (\'for every action...").
Weapons with longer barrels DO build up that same energy over a
longer period of time, however, allowing your recoil management
devices more time to absorb that recoil (ie: more of a
squishy-squooshy kind of recoil, rather than the garden-variety
hit-over-the-head-with-a-sledgehammer kind of recoil).  The end
result is less recoil felt by the user.

Not entirely true.  As babies, we all apparently have the ability
to breath AND swallow at the same time, as well as a fundamental
ability to swim.  We seem to lose these abilities within the
first year or so, but they *are* genetic.

It\'s not a lot, but it\'s a start :)

DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual (for MT) was keen to point out that 
it\'s not just the energy pumped into a j-grid which causes a good 
jump, it\'s the "shape" of the energy profile: you have to charge up 
quickly and smoothly, and you can\'t hold that charge for long.  I 
think one reason for this was to imply that unusual means of charging 
jump capacitors were at least difficult.

Let\'s say j-capacitors are designed for very short-term storage and 
very fast release, and need to be charged all at once.  If normal 
capacitors can be used to charge the JD, it could take something like 
ten times the volume of the original capacitors (which works out at 
approximately 5% of ship volume per jump number, conveniently 
enough) to charge the j-caps intensely enough.  This would require 
less fuel volume than CT/T4 (or MT, slightly) but be insanely 
expensive. (Perhaps a factor 10 was too big.)

I think this might be "low-grade" energy, and require extra 
capacitors at the very least. That\'s if you turn the globe off to 
jump...

If you don\'t, I would rule that it\'s not unlike trying to jump from 
a craft already in j-space. (A globe\'d ship is not unlike a jumping 
one, cut off from the universe.) All that energy going off *inside* 
the field would just feed back into the capacitors, probably melting 
things via hysteresis before it atrophies away, leaving a rather hot 
ship (sans black globe and much other electronics).

OTOH, if characters want to try it, finding a black globe generator 
could take years of adventure while you work out what happens.

Even STR, DEX, and END are affected by training. We don\'t really have

Static electricity easily provides a *lot* more voltage than that. You
can get multiple thousand volt charges merely by unrolling part of a
roll of tape. (Gee, this stuff is in tape form... :-)

And conductive materials exposed to magnetic fields (or to EM radiation
such as radio waves) will get moderate voltages via induction effects.

This is *why* detonators are treated with such care in the real world.
Static from the wrong sort of clothes, or a stray radio broadcast can
set them off! So the detontators are kept with the wires *shorted* and
in shielded boxes.

Believe me, we\'ve got at least 150 years of "oops" type mistakes to
look back on. We\'ve learned the hard way that Murphy *likes* it when
you keep explosives and detonators close together.

Anything that can program a clone can program a non-clone. And would

for example). 

"Forced growth" *may* be possible. But you can use that along with ova
and sperm banks to "mass produce" workers without cloning. F.M. Busby\'s
"Rissa Kerguelen" books cover this as a side issue. It\'s *not* a "nice"
technology... not unless its use is rare.

And without forced growth and "programming", all a clone will be is a
identical twin that isn\'t the same age. 

That\'s the point. All that a clone ism is an identical twin generated
artificially. And twins aren\'t carbon copies. Ones raised years apart
are going to be even less so.

Where\'s the market? It\'d just be a different take on slavery. And
slaves are cheaper as you don\'t need skilled labor to produce them.

Now *if* certain traits can be *proven* to have a genetic basis, then
there\'d be some interest in clones. And a lot more in gene therapy to
add the traits to one\'s children.

No designer worth his salt will have the power leads exposed that way.
Precisely *because* of nasty people like you. :-)

My preffered surprise for boarders in BD is a special grenade. You
evacuate the atmosphere, kill the gravity and lob in one. It\'s a
thermal charge wrapped in sodium or potassium. The result is a stream
of metal vapor that will flash plate itself over any nearby surface. 

Sensors don\'t work well with an opaque layer of metal over them!
Neither do visors. Radio antennas are shorted to the suit (which will
*ruin* the transmitter if you key your mike). Also, your suit just
turned into a big thermos. It\'s gonna get *real* hot in there *real*
quick (seriously, loss of cooling in a spacesuit can render you
unconcious in *minutes*). 

This simple device should be a standard item anywhere that vacuum and
combat are together. Oh yes, anyone caught by the fringe of the effect
will get a nice surprise when they reach air. The coating may catch
fire...

They also make a nasty incendiary in most atmospheres. :-)

Nasty! But actually, won\'t the BD point-defence laser punch a hole in 
it? I assume in normal operation the thermal charge turns the metal 
into vapour, and the grenade bursts when the internal pressure 
becomes high.  A hole would mean a single stream of metal vapour, 
which would rapidly cool into small droplets anyway.

Having said which, the thought of one of these being thrown at me
if I were in a vac suit gives me the screaming heebie-geebies... just 
think of what the metal would do to almost any suit material you 
care to name: you\'d lose all the surface of the suit, tho\' probably 
not to any real depth.
 
Only real problem is that even if you win, you have a heck of a time 
cleaning up your ship, what with alkali metal painted all up the 
walls (and probably not doing them a power of good either).  The best 
thing to do would be to dissolve the stuff in absolutely dry 
ethanol, but shipboard all that\'s going to be available is water 8-).

[Sodium and potassium react slowly with ethanol to form sodium 
ethoxide and hydrogen, whereas water reacts quite dramatically to 
give metal hydroxide and H_2... and quite a lot of heat very quickly.]

Oh, and your stores chief is going to be a nervous individual.

I\'ve read in a book that Meson(quark-antiquark) particles have a life span
of 10^-16s before their degeneration in two gamma photons. This life span
is too short to do a very long distance of several hexes.

For example 10 hexes is 1s at light speed. 

But in the other hand, As the time slows with speed, is it correct to give
the next explaination :

I accelerate the Meson particle to the speed where the time flow is 10^-16s
per second of a static observator. In 1s (of the observator) the particle
would \'live\' its average life span. the particle degenerate 1s after its
creation in the observator scale. The particle which speed is realy near
lgith speed covers the 10 hexes is 1s

So to reach a specified range with a Meson gun you just have to calculate
the velocity of the particle (which has to be VERY VERY precise indeed)

Does it sound correct?


Graviton question ----

I\'m thinking of another quesiton, about graviton quesiton.

I am in a gravity field of a planet for example. Who radiates gravitons
?(me or the planets) and in which direction? (toward each other, or in
backward direction)

And the traveller related question is : how Contragrav devices interfere
with the graviton flow?

Unfortunately, the picture of a laser which pokes holes inthings is not
very accurate.  A laser will heat things and melt or incinerate them.  It
will not disintegrate or penetrate (except where it has melted or
vaporized stuff on the outer layer).

That said, it could be that at higher TLs the laser is fucussed or paired
with another beam (microwave laser? x-ray? florine?) which makes it\'s
effects more dramatic (this is the take I use) and more like star trek
phasers (tm).

So, using "real science" accellerated projectiles will transmit the energy
via kinetic impact better than a laser using the same energy (assuming
they are within an order of magnitude in efficiency of transmission to
target) simply because the kinetic delivery is more effectivethat the
heat-energy delivery.

But, using "speculative science" I would say that as TLs go up your laser
rifle/carbine becomes a more effective weapon relative to the gauss rifle.
with a (guessed at) "pivot point" of TL12 or TL13.

As a contrast, working a Boy Scout rifle range (Parker Mt. Scout
Reservation, Barnstead NH) when a chipmunk crossed the range.  As soon as
the thing arrived in the firing range area there was ....  complete
silence .... the range director said "cease fire" *after* everyone had
stopped to watch the cute little chipmunk swiftly cross to the other
side and go up over the embankment (although one person did a little
chipmunk imitation saying "ohshit! ohshit! ohshit!" over and over until he
left the range in a falsetto voice).

If a bunch of 12-17 year old \'scouts can listen to the instruction "If any
living thing enters the range, cease fire immediately", Why can\'t a bunch
of pros?

Of course, maybe if they\'d had automatic weapons...

Because things like instinct could be decoded by your neural hardware
which is encoded genetically, but your alphabet isn\'t, so you can
access that knowledge.  It\'s just a theory of course. :)

Except that they\'ll choose the same color of shirts/tie, the same name for

Ok, Lets get this straight.  The idea (IMHO) behind "gravitons" is similar
in concept to the idea of "photons"; a word to describe something which,
sometimes, acts like a particle, while it is acting like a particle.

Keep in mind that 1). this is all handwaving and 2). we are trying to
describe the behavior of an invisible, undetectable, theoretical particle
that isn\'t always a particle.

When you are in the "gravity field" of a planet the planet is emmitting
a gravitic effect not on you, but on the space around you, which distorts
that space such that you are drawn towards the planet.  Your ship (and,
for that matter, you) are also distorting the space around *you*.

Contragrav prevents the gravitons emitted from nearby sources from
affecting the space in the area of effect of the contragrav by
\'refracting\' or bending the particles around the area of effect.  For this
reason there may be an area of marginally increased gravity immediately
around the contragrav area of effect (really, I\'m making this up as I go
along!).  It is marginal because the graviton waves are all displaced for
a large area by one another.  

Basically, gravitic technology centers around making an "immunity zone"
where gravity is nullified, or (in the case of inertial compensators and
grav floor plates) creating a small scale distortion by emitting \'fake
gravitons\' in a limited area.  Please, don\'t ask me to elaborate.

Again, this is all handwaving.  I do not think that the materials in
traveller go into it too deeply.  These are props to be used in the
performance that is roleplaying, not things to be explained or described
in too much detail ("Pay no attention to the referee behind the
curtain.").  The mechanics are sometimes an important plot device.  Of
course, if you have fun doing so, please do.

Under CT, specifically High Guard, this was allowed more or less by the
rules.  So you had exploration ships, used in pairs, with no Jump Fuel,
but lots of extra capacitors and PP fuel - still less massive than the
Jump Fuel - and J6 drives.  They would use their lasers to charge up their
capaciters and jump 6 along.  They didn\'t need to refuel for about a year.
Instant super explorers.

When DGP retconned in the explanation for the Starship Operaters Manual,
it always seemed to me that it was just to stop this kind of silliness (I
never did like the explanation, but it was better than the alternative).

Gravity is different from electromagnetic radiation (light, radio,
micrwaves, etc.).  I was always under the impression that black globes
stopped Electromagnetic radiation.  Besides, given the level of Gravity
control available in Traveller, wouldn\'t the 3rd Imperium have figured out
how to do this if it was possible??

of course, my response to players who try to munchkinize like this is to
say "try it and find out", and then kill them.

Yep.  The reason that a rifle attains higher muzzle velocities than a
pistol is that the long barrel allows expanding gasses to continue
accelerating the round through a greater distance.  In fact, one of the
central optimization problems involved in rifle and rifle ammo design is
putting in exactly enough propellant that the combustion-product
overpressure behind the bullet is just approaching zero as the round
leaves the barrel.  Too little propellant, and friction from the
additional barrel length slows the round more than the tiny remaining
pressure accelerates it over the last part of the barrel.  Too much
propellant, and some of it is wasted as a puff of gas as the bullet leaves
the barrel.

A gauss weapon of muzzle velocity V and length L, firing rounds of mass M,
will have less kick than a chemical rifle of the same parameters, because
for a gauss weapon the acceleration is (nearly) constant over the length
of the barrel, while for a chemical rifle the acceleration is slewed
toward the near end of the barrel.  But in both cases the same net
momentum (M*V) is transfered to the rifle (and thence to whoever is
holding it), and as the total transit time down the barrel is measured in
milliseconds, the difference will be hard to notice.

    'body' => 'Dear Fellow Clonies:

Have been reading with some interest the discussion of 
cloning in the current news and the TNL.  Here are my
thoughts.

First, let me speak from my experiences as a biologist.
In 1973-1974, I learned in basic and advanced high
school biology the process of one natural cloning
method and one artificial cloning method.  I won\'t
discuss twins just yet.

The first natural method was known as parthenogenisis,
"virgin birth."  It occurs in several species, the one
we studied was a lizard, the Genus species escapes me,
but the clone produced was only female because the
source DNA was female.  This species only produced
females.  What hormone caused the process escapes
me but I recall that there was a definite lack of
any male hormone in the species.  Any biologist out
there, please confirm.  The joke in class was that
there was only one recorded "virgin birth" in humans.

The next exposure to cloning was through the simulated
fertilization of, I believe, the pickeral frog.  The
G.s. escapes me again.  Here we took a fertile female,
ready to release her eggs.  When she let go, we pricked
each egg with a glass needle, simulating the penetration
of the sperm.  The eggs began to divide after several
hours.  Noticeable changes occurred within 24 hrs.  The
results, again, all females.  Approximately 50% success.
We used the surviving frogs for fish bait as musky,
pickeral and pike were always in season.

A quick flash forward to 1997.  Dolly, as she is known,
makes the news.  A ewe....female sheep for you...awe
never mind.  Anyways...I haven\'t read the recent journals,
but I am sure the fact that she is female has some bearing
on the above discussions.  There may be some predisposition
involving the female sex and cloning....If I recall its
the presence of the XX pair of chromosomes and
their natural propensitiy for replication.  If you have
read the news, she was the one success out of 300
attempts.  A rate of 0.3%.  Notice how the success rate
has fallen in artificial cloning as the complexity
of the organism has increased.  I don\'t know the
ratio of the chromosome pairs between the two
species.  Anybody know?

Now race to TL 15/16....The clone in question is
female compared to the source of the DNA.  Did we
perpetuate the female clone?  Was this result
on purpose?  Knowing the predisposition of
the female chromosome for replication, maybe the
former result is expected and predisposed.  Okay,
so you\'re asking where are we going.

Cloning should be difficult, even at TL 15/16, and
maybe the results can only be female.  Oh gosh, I
can here the comments from the ladies now. The
production of a male clone might be exorbitant.

With lower organisms, there is an assumed imprinting
of "knowledge" we call instincts.  These do not vary
from subject to subject animal in the same Genus
species. These instints cause the animal to act in
a fairly predictable manner.

Consider basic instints in the human.  Having raised
three children and assisting with four grandchildren...
now you really know how old I am..I don\'t think
any scientist, psycologist or nanny for that matter,
can prepare a cloned human to act in a predictable
manner.  Knowledge is not inate nor can it be
imprinted in the current technology.  Basic reactions
to hunger, thirst, cold or heat may be imprinted
due to neurological design.  Emotions...fear, anxiety,
etc are learned and developed.  From that stand point,
I can see implantation of knowledge but not emotions.
Basically I see the human clone as a semi-robot,
knowledge without emotion.

The question begging to be answered...Can the
human body adapt to huge amounts of data dumps
in a matter of seconds, hours, days.  IMO, I
think not.

Let\'s consider what I was told in 1976, in an
anatomy class.  The human brain had the capacity
of storing information that would be held in
a mainframe computer that would cover around
2 million square feet with racks of seven to
eight feet tall.  That\'s like taking a
single story 2000 sq ft ranch style house and
building it 100 stories tall.  Not considering
the advancements in computer technology, cloning
and installing basic knowledge then becomes an
expensive proposition.  Please consider the fact
that I have not brought up advances in artificial
intelligence (AI) or the creation of robots,
cyborgs and androids.  Anybody have details or want
to expand on this?

So...what\'s my vision?

I agree with some of Christian Razukas scenarios
for clones except #4.  Don\'t take me wrong.  I
believe in using animals for experiments and the assisting
of human kind.  I\'m a biologist, remember?...I can
see I\'ll have angered the Animal Rights Lobby.  The
conflict I see is in organ compatability, the
increases in infection and rejection, and biological
mismatching.  Okay, I didn\'t consider advancements
in antibiotics and other drugs.  While Christain
did not consider writing about cloning humans for
organ donation, maybe that is a scenario for a war
over the rights of clones.  Maybe a thought provoking
scenario for the player characters.

SOAPBOX:
Whether humans are ever cloned or not, I think each
clone should be considered an individual.  When we
look at multiple, identical births...Nature\'s 
other cloning method...each individual, while
predisposed in many ways, has experiences that
are treated differently by the individual, and
knowledge gained is a little different between
individuals.  Attitudes, opinions, etc are
formulated differently.  I won\'t step into
the area of mental or sensory perception links
between these types of individuals even though
I\'ve witnessed the connection.
OFF SOAPBOX

I agree with Merrick.  Clones are basically twins.
See above.  But consider at what stage of life
they are created from the source individual and
what level of knowledge needs to be developed.

Is the clone created from an adult?  Then the
knowledge base of the clone would be far removed
from the source individual.  The emotional base
would similarly be far removed.

Is the clone created close to the birth of the
source individual?  The knowledge base and the
emotional base should be close, maybe varying
only by 15%.  At this point we\'re near the realm
of twins.

Is the clone created before the birth of the
source individual?  Now we have entered the
realm oof twins.  Knowledge and emotional
base are about the same, differing by maybe
5%.

Then consider physiology.  A clone, if properly
cared for should develop into a _similar_ like-
ness of the source individual.  Neglect or
Supercare could create a totally different
individual.

Knowledge, as Jeff Harvey stated, could be the
product of AI implants.  Then why worry about
schools, training and EDU?  I point back to the
expenses of AI and implants.  High cost and
low return for the value.  The cost of the 
human clone becomes too high to consider
unless you\'re in the shoes of Strephon,
Cleon or the like.

Clones then become an agricultural method for
producing high quality food at low cost.  Think
of my experiences with the frogs and a cheap
source of bait for my pike fishing.   Consider
the creation of the hypercow and the hypersheep
producing huge quantities of milk, beef, wool or
mutton...nuttin but muttin??..Oops, my fantasy
mode.  Consider the hypergrain stuff, producing
protein laced carbohydrates.  High quantities,
of high quality food at reasonable prices.

BTW, one GDW game had battalions of clones
supported by a company that used the battalions
as a peacekeeping force on their planet, keeping
the natives and the trade unions at bay.  These
battalions were called "MyKin" battalions, based
upon the fact that all the members of the batallions
were clones of the commander.  My copy is under
boxes since we\'re renovating in the house.  Can
anybody confirm my summation of this game, as
well as its title?

See ya later.

I always assumed that with knowledge of gravatics, the technology to
manipulate the strong and weak nuclear forces was developed.  With
mesons, it\'s a matter of manipulating it so they won\'t decay until you
want them to.

Actually it\'s a bit easier to think of gravity in terms of the geometery
of space/time.  Gravitational fields are just \'dents\' in the 4-d space
geometery (imagine a 2-d space--like a rubber sheet--in 3-d hyperspace;
a gravity field is a warp/dent in the 2-d universe--objects simply slide
down the slope)  Contra gravity either creates an \'equal/opposite\' warp
on the \'lee\' side of the mass, or nulls the slope that its on (like
poking the rubber sheet so that there\'s a flat area on the slope)

     Well, according to FF&S the recoil on it was minimal; approx 1.54.
I\'ve just rechecked it, and it would seem that I was right the first time.
Without the gyroscopic compensation it was 6.175, which seems a little more
in line; it\'s almost all an average human can do to handle the recoil from
one shot.  So basically, I think that the recoil compensation part of the
FF&S gauss gun sequence must be a little bust.

Oh great.  I see your psionic conditioning is breaking down, and the

Some interesting work along these lines was done in early 1980s, and could
be extended for a Traveller campaign. There\'s good evidence that activity
in a neuron is coded in proteins held in the Golgi complex inside the cell
(obfuscation: send the players on a wild goose chase based on fragmentary
information about "the Golgi complex", only to find out it\'s not a set of
buildings or a psychosis after all :) ).  Whether these proteins code for
specific experience or something else isn\'t known, but as I recall
experiments with fairly simple animals (planaria and aplysia) show some
knowledge transfer from just these proteins.  

So (hand-waving on) you might be able to posit a non-invasive MRI-like scan
(personal opinion: MRI scanning is really TL10! :) ) that picks up on and
records the patterns of enough of these proteins stored in enough of the
neurons that they can be reproduced in a clone.  This would give you a
rough starting set of experiences and memories; the better, longer, and
more detailed the original scan, the better the behavioral match in the
clone.  Of course, as the brain is a nonlinear system, the clone would be
almost certain to demonstrate odd or even aberrant behaviors from time to
time ranging from gaps in knowledge to sudden changes in mood or action.
Thus, a doppleganger clone could never be _totally_ trusted, and would need
to have knowledgeable handlers nearby (faux-Cleon and his most inner circle
of advisors?).

Well, the main difference is that they were Boy Scouts, and we\'re Soldiers.
We *like* shooting a dumb animals that wander onto live ranges like deer,
chipmunks, and 2nd Lieutenats.  

I could tell about the time I fired a Barrett Light .50 and hit a squirrel..

vaporized squirrel floated off into the trees...

Hmmm... another take on this:

The Templars were a Rule of Man organization, acting much as the Earthly
Templars did, guarding trade routes, etc., but secretly investigating the
reasons for all these human races, and the mysterious Ancients.  Near the
end of the RoM, an Emperor became jealous/fearful of their power, and
destoyed them.  Or so he thought.  The organization went underground.

It\'s possible that the Long Night was a Templar retaliation against the RoM!

Now, fast foward to the dawn of the Imperium.. Why is Cleon so determined to
expand to Spinward?  Could he, or his advisors, be Templars who belive that
they at last have the secret of the Ancients, and that it lies somewhers
beyond Deneb?

What exzctly did the Templars learn?  What artifacts did they carry off
during the crusade against them?  What if the Third Imperium is just a
Templar plot, to unknown ends.

A campaign set with this backround could be quite paranoid, with the PCs
slowly learning about this group, and discovering their shadowy hand
maniuplating affairs throughout known space...

BTW: A good read on the conspiracy side of the Templars is "Holy Blood, Holy
Grail."

This is the cannonical explanation, in fact.

There are two main problems with it which have to be waved away with
indistinguishable-from-magic technology:

(1) Boosting a pi-0 meson to have a lifetime of 1 second takes a tremendous
amount of energy per particle - probably beyond even theoretically
practical particle accelerator design. You\'re somewhat better off using
other mesons, like the K-0, which have somewhat more moderate lifetimes.

(2) The lifetime of a meson isn\'t a little ticking clock guaranteed to
always go off at 10^-16s; it\'s a half-life - a statistical average. Mesons
start decaying immediately; by 10^-16s half of them are gone, by
2x10^-16 seconds 75% are gone, etc. A meson beam would have a continous
stream of decays all along the length of the beam - and always more
decays the closer to the firing ship.

This latter gets handwaved away by assuming that miraculous damper 
technology lets you set the internal clock so that each meson *does* have
a definite lifetime. From a QM standpoint this is illegal, of course, but
it lets meson guns work.

(The cancer-treatment experiments that Miller et al were almost certainly
thinking of when they invented the meson gun - which deposit almost all their
energy in brain tumors without depositing much in the intervening tissue -
work because they use charged mesons, which (like all charged particles)
initially deposity little energy as they pass through a solid,
only dumping most of their energy after they\'ve slowed down a little.
The decay of the meson after it stops provides an extra burst of energy
at the end. This only works for charged particles travelling through moderate
amounts of solid matter...)

[Craig Berry] >> After much pondering, I\'m going to stand 
by my statements.  On the whole,  with the exception of a

Well, to a point. However, consider history. In the early 
industrial period (early 1800s to WW I), people generally 
lived within walking distance of their workplace, at most a 
train ride; or at them, as with farmworkers. As time has 
progressed, however, we have people commuting further and 
further to their places of work - in large part because 
living nearer is becoming either prohibitivelty expensive 
or dangerous or unpleasant. So I drive from Warrington to 
Stockport every day - 20 miles - where a hundred years ago 
folk in Stockport might have gone to Liverpool once a 
_month_. In t\'south of England, people I know commute a 
hundred miles or more to work every day. In Japan the crazy 
salarymen ride the Hokkaido for _hours_ every day to get to 
work. 

Now expand this to the 57th century, where interface 
transport is dirt cheap, either by grav vehicles or 
beanstalks. Maybe not every day, but I can see people 
commuting to orbit to work each week and coming home - to 
the ground - at the weekend.

That is precisely how it would work.  Of course, one must do some
additional handwaving, as the meson lifetime is a random quantum decay
process, not a sharp single lifetime; in other words, half of all mesons
produced will decay before 10^-16 seconds (in their own rest frame), half
after.  But some will decay much sooner, and some much later; you get a
slightly skewed Bell curve centered on the mean lifetime.  Thus, using
physics as we know them, it seems impossible to put more than an
insignficant fraction of your mesons inside the target at the moment they
decay; the vast majority will go off early or late, and be pretty
harmless.

Thus, a practical meson gun would need to somehow tinker with the quantum
nature of meson decay itself (paging Mr. Greg Bear...) to \'focus\' the
decay into an unnaturally tight \'window\'.

Gravitons are the mediating particles of gravity; you and the planet
exchange them, sort of.  Be aware that this is a terrible
oversimplification; it\'s equally valid to say that the planet and you both
warp the four-dimensional structure of spacetime such that geodesics curve
in fourspace in a manner which manifests as an attractive force between
you and the planet.  Coupling the geometric view of gravitation to the
quantum mechanical view is one of the Holy Grails of physics, the unsolved
portion of the Grand Unified Theory.

Even STR, DEX, and END are affected by training. We don\'t really have

I was thinking more of a way to bias the stats high to represent specific
training/genetic manipulation. The clones (replicants) in Bladerunner are
more really geneticlly engineered human replacements? They are designed to

OK, you don\'t get to be navigator on *my* ship. :)  Orion is almost
exactly in the opposite direction from the Galactic Core.  The latter is
in Sagittarius, while as anyone who\'s been under dark skies in late winter
knows, Orion is just south of Gemini and Taurus, way over on the other
side of the zodiac.  By the way, a nice piece of sky orientation to know
is that Orion\'s belt stars lie almost precisely on the celestial equator.

According to Henbest & Couper\'s _Guide to the Galaxy_ (Cambridge, 1994),
this isn\'t too accurate, D.K. I\'ve never heard of a "Pegasus Arm" - usually
our region is known as the Local Arm or the Orion Arm. The Orion complex
itself lies to rimward and trailing of the Sun, not coreward.

If you draw a map with the Orion Arm running left to right, angling
slightly downward to the right, the Core is very far off the top of the
page, spinward is towards the left, trailing to the right. On this map, the
Orion Nebula, the Orion Molecular Cloud, and the Orion OB1 Association are
all down and to the right of the Sun, roughly 1600 light years away. The
Belt stars are a bit closer, having recently emerged from the star-birth
factory inside the Nebula.

The Perseus arm is farther out to rimward. The Sagittarius Arm swings past
us to coreward. It\'s bigger than the other arms, a \'grand design\' spiral
that wraps right around the Galaxy.

Astronomers used to think that the Orion Arm stretched from Cygnus (to
spinward) to Orion, and thus some suggested that it was only a minor
offshoot of the Perseus Arm, called the "Orion Spur". But more recent
measurements have revealed that the Orion complex actually lies somewhat to
rimward of the main path of arm named for it. The Orion Arm is not so
minor, and stretches from Cygnus to Vela.

It is (I\'m guessing) very roughly 1500 to 3000 light years across,
depending on where and how you measure it. The Sun lies roughly in the
\'middle\', but closer to the coreward edge than the rimward edge. Speaking
of \'edges\' is not really appropriate, though, because the Arms are very
ragged, clumpy, and hard to define. They\'re mostly defined by their loose
\'dust lanes\', patchy chains of giant molecular clouds (GMC\'s) and gaseous
nebulae, and also by the bright star-birth regions associated with these
clouds. Other than the young, bright, massive O and B type stars, which
don\'t burn long enough to wander out of the spiral arms, the star
distribution is pretty much uniform, in and between the arms. The gaps
between the arms have less dust and gas, but the about the same density of
long-lived stars. The gaps between the arms are between 1000 and 2000 light
years across, but in some places the arms seem to merge. In other spots,
one arm seems to split into two.

From _Biology_ (2nd Edition), Neil A. Campbell (Benjamin/Cummings, 1990) -
a really terrific basic biology text I stole from one of my roomies - page
932:

   "Parthenogenesis has a role in the social organization of certain
species of bees, wasps, and ants. Male honeybees, or drones, are produced
parthenogenetically, whereas females, both sterile workers and reproductive
females (queens), develop from fertilized eggs.
   "Among vertebrates, several genera of fishes, amphibians, and lizards
reproduce exclusively by a complex form of parthenogenesis requiring
doubling of chromosomes after meiosis to create diploid \'zygotes\'. For
example, there are about 15 species of whiptail lizards (Genus
Cnemidophorus") that reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis. There are no
males in these species, but the lizards imitate courtship and mating
behavior typical of sexual species of the same genus. During the breeding
season, one female of each \'mating\' pair impersonates a male. The roles
change two or three times during the season... In fact, ovulation is more
likely to occur if an individual is mounted by a pseudomale during the
critical time of the hormone cycle; isolated lizards lay fewer eggs than
individuals that are allowed to go through the motions of sex. Apparently,
these parthenogenetic lizards, which evolved from species having two sexes,
still require certain sexual stimuli for maxiumum reproductive success."

I\'m designing one of the sophont species for my campaign based on this
pattern. Also, I\'ve developed a genetically-engineered all-female Clade
(variant species) of humans known as "Parthens" who reproduce this way.

>The joke in class was that
>there was only one recorded "virgin birth" in humans.

Joking aside, I suspect that it is possible, and it might well be happening
all the time. Some of the books I\'ve read on twins and on reproductive
genetics suggest that there may be rare conceptions in which the sperm
triggers cell division, but for some reason none of the male\'s genes are
taken up. This would result in a daughter who is a genetic twin of her
mother. Ever meet a girl who looks so much like her mother\'s old photos
that it\'s spooky?

When we invent technology capable of quickly and cheaply sequencing a
person\'s genes, I suspect we are going to find that a surprising number of
women (maybe 1 in 100,000, say) are genetically identical to their mothers.
But this is pure wild speculation on my part.

Well, all this talk about clones should motivate me to finally finish that
article about clone societies in Traveller, which I\'ve been promising to do
for months now...

    'topic' => ' Ship to Ship Combat (Long)',
    'body' => 'I have received several comments and questions on the ship combat rules
I posted awhile back. Here is a few more thoughts and explanations:

Hit Points:=20
I did not tie the hit points directly to tonnage in some sort of 1:1
ratio because the ships in Traveller range from a 10 ton fighter to a
million ton dreadnought. The problem is ether small ships that are
vaporized with one hit, or hundreds of thousands of hit points for the
big ships. I wanted small ships that could survive, and I hate lots of
unwieldy numbers. So I had to find a way to flatten the curve.=20

The formula, Hit Points (HP) =3D Integer (Square root of ship tonnage)  X
(base 10 logarithm of ship tonnage), seems to do it and provides
manageable numbers at all sizes:
Tons HP   %
100  20   20.0%
200  32   16.0%
400  52   13.0%
(snip)
12800     464  3.6%
25600     705  2.8%
(snip)
800000    5279 0.7%
1000000   6000 0.6%

Big ships are weaker as far as the HP ratio goes. But the upper limit on
damage caused by my weapons reduces the impact of that problem. In other
words, a big ship is still more survivable. See example below more a
better understanding.

The actual hit points would be ~20% or higher then above for some
technology, hull design and/or armor bonuses.

Critical Hits:=20
I never liked the High Guard / Traveller
one-critical-hit-and-you\'re-out-of-the-game rule. No reason to spend
trillions on big ships, as they are just too weak. If you have to fight
a base, or planet, forget it. One good whack, and most of the invasion
fleet is nothing but critically hit hulls crashing on the ground.=20

I feel that big ships should be able to take lots of damage before
losing any combat effectiveness. And the really big ships will have to
be ganged up on, or they will crush the enemy fleet. Only after the ship
has absorbed several rounds of punishing fire will it start to effect
operations. I think of Traveller capital ships as close relatives to the
old WWI and WWII Battleships.  Most of the time they took HUGE amounts
of damage before losing any of their punch. Very survivable. (Until
damage passed a certain point, then it was goodbye: they would turn
turtle and sink, sometimes with guns still firing!)=20

Until Traveller comes up with a effective ship killing weapon that can
be carried by small craft (never happen in my game!) the Big Battleship
Fleet will rule space. The little boys are like the old biplanes:
scouts, forward observers or running around picking off critically
damaged ships.=20

And for PC=92s in small ships it was just too quick.=20
BANG! "Uh, your fuel tanks just got vaporized. Sorry."
No progression, no building of suspense. I didn=92t like it at all.

That is why I base the chance of getting a critical hit on the ratio of
damage received to damage left. Or the formula:
=09
Damage Ratio =3D Damage received that turn divided by (Damage remaining -
Damage received that turn)

By having the critical hit chance be entirely part of how much damage
the ship has taken, a ship can survive the first few hits. Or even many
little hits with little trouble. It may be a little faster during the
game to base critical hits on some total number of points or on a roll,
but that is not how I envision ship damage. This system requires only
one quick calculation, and provides me with the results I was looking
for. Damage that gets worse as the game goes on.

Also, my critical hits are not the ship killing results (unless you get
hit enough, then the damage passes your damage controls ability to fix)
of HG or T4. Once more, that is unfair to the big ships, and I like big
ships in my game. :-)

For Example:
Here is a 50,000 ton TL 14 ship. It gets pounded each turn by a spinal
mount (Type J or K or something) doing about 200 points per turn. (Until
the last few turns when they stop firing the big gun and switch to bay
and turrets, or other small ships to close in for the kill)=20

HP      Damage  Total   Hp      ratio   Avg.    Avg.=20
                Damage                  CriticalNumber
1336    200     200     1136    0.2     33%     0.5
1136    200     400     936     0.2     33%     0.5
936     200     600     736     0.3     50%     1.0
736     200     800     536     0.4     67%     1.7
536     200     1000    336     0.6     100%    3.5
336     200     1200    136     1.5     100%    10.5
136     100     1300    36      2.8     100%    10.5
36      36      1336    0       DX             =20

The Average Critical is the percent chance of actually getting a
critical hit on the ship. =20
The Average Number shows the average number of critical hits the ship
will take that turn, if any. =20

So on the first turn the 50K ship has about a 1/3 chance of recieving a
critical if it gets hit with 200 points. That is probably only one
critical hit, if any. Like I said, this is TEMPARARY damage. If the crew
has any type of DC (Damage Control) the critical hit will be fixed,
fast. But the system will NOT be at 100%. In other words, if the drives
get hit, they will drop off-line. In the same turn (it is 30 minutes
after all) the DC crew can try to fix it. If they succeed, the ship is
back, but at -1 to the drive.=20

By the 5th hit the crew is getting swamped. Bad things are happening all
over the ship and the crew has to pick their fights. The ship has
probably suffered 7-10 critical hits by now and is will not be moving
very fast (if at all).=20

The next 200 point hit probably puts the ship out of the fight. 8-13
more critical hits, (average of 10.5) in one turn! Time to start
thinking about survival. =20

Example 2:
Now here is a TL 14 100,000 ton ship, outfitted the exact same way. It
takes exactly the same amount of  damage as the 50k ton ship above in
the exact same order:
HP      Damage  Total   Hp      ratio   Avg.    Avg.=20
                Damage                  CriticalNumber
2012 200  200  1812 0.1  17%  0.2
1812 200  400  936  0.1  17%  0.2
1612 200  600  1412 0.1  17%  0.2
1412 200  800  1212 0.2  33%  0.5
1212 200  1000 1012 0.2  33%  0.5
1012 200  1200 812  0.2  33%  0.5
812  100  1300 712  0.1  17%  0.2
712  36   1336 676  0.1  17%  0.2
676                      Total     2.3

Not bad. Only has 676 points of damage left, but has only suffered about
2.3 critical hits! Compare that to the 20 or so on the 50k ship.

Damage Control can easily keep up. It may be moving a little slower, and
the hull will look like it has been through a shredder, but who cares!
It can still fight!! Yes, it will require a major refit to repair all of
those hit points, but hey, which ship would you want to be on in a
battle.=20

Lets look at what happens if that ship gets hit with ALL those points in
one turn:
HP      Damage  Total   Hp      ratio   Avg.    Avg.=20
                Damage                  CriticalNumber
2012 1336 1336 676  2.0  100% 10.5

Major hit! That ship just received 8-13 critical hits (average of 10.5)
verses the 2.3 from above. DC will have trouble keeping up, but that is
still not the 20 plus that the smaller 50k ship received above. It may
be able to still fight! ("I have not yet begun to fight!!" The Capt.
cries out!)

Now I can explain why the Imperium has all of those 500,000 ton
Dreadnoughts and 100,000 ton Battleriders hanging around. With the HG
rules I would have just built as many small cheap ships wrapped around a
meson gun as possible. No fun for the big ship fan.

By the way, I allow more than one Spinal Mount per ship in my game. So
for example the TL-15 500,000 ton Tigress Class has 6 big Meson Guns,
7500+ Hit Points and 6 of those were a holy terror to the Zhodani 40th
fleet during the FFW! I did this to get rid of the thousands of turrets
carried by big ships. Took way too many rolls and too much time. Now I
can have a really fun big ship slugging contest, with a role for all the
escorts and fighters; picking off the easy targets or protecting the
crippled ships attempting to pull back from the line to save the ship.

This ratio works just as good at the 100-800 ton level as well. Factor
1-6 weapons do about 1-20 points of damage and the ships have about
20-150 Hit Points. Perfect for player characters! They can get hit a few
times without too much critical damage, but they know that unless they
do something fast, their ship is going to be slag due to all the
critical hits in the next turn or two. This is exactly the results I was
looking for. Something that works across the entire spectrum of ships in
the Traveller universe, is quick, solves the "why big ships question",
and offers good role playing potential with plenty of suspense for the
PC\'s.

I hope this helps, and I appreciate any and all feed back.

are jumbled together with others. After a period of adjustment, this 
condition is no longer debilitating, just weird ("Hey, quit shouting red 
daggers at me!" 
Synaesthesia is occasionally also associated with particular advantages 
such as photographic memory, artistic or musical ability. 
5. Other mild neurological conditions such as attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, Tourette\'s syndrome, dyslexia on either a 
temporary or permanent basis. 
6. Glandular malfunction. The traveller\'s glandular system reacts very 
badly towards the physics of jumpspace. This may trigger mood swings, 
depression, hyperactivity, diabetes, or even glandular obesity. Effects 
may be temporary or permanent; traveller may require hormone therapy or 
gland transplants in order to function normally.

It\'s possible that the Long Night was a Templar retaliation against the
RoM!

Now, fast foward to the dawn of the Imperium.. Why is Cleon so
determined to expand to Spinward?  Could he, or his advisors, be
Templars who belive that they at last have the secret of the Ancients,
and that it lies somewhers beyond Deneb?

What exzctly did the Templars learn?  What artifacts did they carry off
during the crusade against them?  What if the Third Imperium is just a
Templar plot, to unknown ends.

A campaign set with this backround could be quite paranoid, with the PCs
slowly learning about this group, and discovering their shadowy hand
maniuplating affairs throughout known space...>>>



Ah yes... now we are getting to the real reasons for:
Why the Third Imperium never expanded past the Spiward Marches!
Why the Third Imperium has the highest tech!
The "real" reasons the Zhodani were always attacking! (none of this
silly stuff about "slowing the 3I down...")

Its all getting very clear now, ... (did they find something?...)

Or is it just a Hiver plot?

     Well, actually, I think that roasting the K\'kree is a very good
thing to do;

     a) they\'re vegetarians (and really obnoxious about it to boot),

      b) cooking meat prior to eating it generally makes for a
better-tasting meal, permitting among other things marinades and other
culinary frills, and

     c) lowers the risk of disease or parasite infestation.

Amazing coincidence!  I drive from Pace to Warrington every day to work -
21 miles -, of course my Warrington is about 6,000 miles from your
Warrington. ;->

My parents lived 5 to 10 miles from their jobs..depending on the job..and
my grandparents were farmers, they lived where they worked.

It\'s common for people to commute much longer distances these days,
spending hours..literally..on the road morning and evening.  OTOH, the way
traffic is getting you can spend hours travelling and still only be
covering a few dozen miles. ;->

This is exactly what I used in a beginning session last weekend.  The PC\'s
began as criminals (well, some were, some were falsely accused) in
cryosleep on an exile ship.  The local dictator is rather twisted (read:
insane) and enjoys sending traitors into exile on a nearby rock that used
to be a research base (research for what...? you might ask) before the
Collapse (yes, TNE).  One of the real criminals on board \'had and angle\'
and had inserted an agent onto the crew, who then proceeded to botch a
recalibration of the jump as the drives were charging.  Misjump was
inevitable.  Part of the jump field collapsed and tore off a fuel module
and a cryo module (not the one the PCs were in, of course).  The rickety
old pre-Collapse crate couldn\'t deal with it and all hell broke loose...
electrical systems shorted, AG went haywire... and all the remaining
cryotubes failed.  Some actually had working safeties, and cycled down to
release the occupants.  Five in fact, coincidentally the number of PCs.
Thus began our adventure.

The moral of the story: Interesting misjumps can be fun.

You want to get real paranoid?  What if this has something to do with why
the FIRST Imperium never expanded in Corridor, and why the Zhodani stopped
where they did.  What do the Darriens know, being the closest race to the
Ancient\'s homeworld(s).

What was the real cause of the Psionic Supressions... were the Institutes on
the verge of something?  Something the secret masters weren\'t ready to allow.

A conspiracy extending back over 5000 years.. now who could be behind this?

(Hint: He\'s scaly, has wings, is real smart, and has a real dysfunctional
family...)

As for the Hivers.. Perhaps the reason Hivers and Solomani never really
interacted was a shadow war between the Templars and the Hiver Manipulators.

I like where this is going...

Beathing and swallowing ceases to be possible as the neck grows.  I

     The Real History of Manipulations of the K\'kree Race

(a transcript of a speech by M. Seldon to the Manipulations Club of Guaran, 
date: 032-1105)

     Greetings to my old friends this evening, and especially to our new 
colleagues, who have just tonight been granted their Manipulators status. 
Again, congratulations. I hope you have enjoyed the corndogs graciously 
provided by the Glethax Nest.

     But now that dinner is over, I urge you to all get comfortable and relax 
on all your limbs, as I will tell you of the Hive Federation\'s second 
largest ongoing manipulation.

     As you were all taught when you were yearlings, we Hivers first contacted 
the K\'kree in -2045. Although we had long guessed that other races might 
have discovered jump drive, we were astonished to find that our first 
contact was with such a violent and uncivilized race as the K\'kree.

     You have all been taught the details of the war that followed. Seven years 
after our first contact, K\'kree vessels made suprise attacks on 12 of our 
worlds. By -2023, they had penetrated into Extolian Sector, and were 
threatening to capture Tryylin, the Ithklur homeworld.

     All of our past contacts with alien races had been solved by 
manipulations, so naturally enough the Manipulations Club was frantically 
studying the situation. Our most optimistic estimates were that it would 
take 850 years of constant manipulation for the K\'kree to reach full 
civilization and be welcomed into our society. Unfortunately, our computer 
simulations of the war were that despite the formation of the Hive 
Federation and our new Hiver Navy, Guaran would fall within 25 years, Glea 
within 75, and the last Hiver world would be conquered in 125 years. We had 
to buy more time.

     You were all taught in your nests that M. Lentuli came up with a plan 
whereby several Hiver ships penetrated deep into the Kilong sector and over 
a period of five years successfully manipulated four worlds to deviate from 
normal K\'kree culture by aberrations such as meat sauces for food and 
isolation as recreation. Then, after entering into negotiations with the 
K\'kree and revealing our manipulations to them and threatening to change 
their entire society, they agreed to sign an armistice and withdraw to 
their pre-war boundaries.

     Since you all are now acknowledged master manipulators, you should now see 
the flaws with this story we tell our yearlings. Those five years are 
simply not enough time to perform a true manipulation on even four worlds. 
What was performed on those four worlds was nothing like a classic Hiver 
manipulation. Instead, a variety of psychoactive drugs and other 
mind-altering techniques were used to mentally "re-program" select 
K\'kreer!. Our implied threat to the entire K\'kree race was a bluff.

     M. Lentuli however realized that the K\'kree would not realize the 
crudeness of our techniques, or that it was simply impossible for us to 
alter their society to any appreciable degree before we were trampled under 
their hooves. He realized that what we were doing is threatening the K\'kree 
sense of superiority by attacking their very sense of themselves, of what 
made them superior.

     The K\'kree acted exactly as M. Lentuli predicted. In addition to ending 
the war and withdrawing to antebellum boundaries (the last was a complete 
surprise to us, we only expected an end to hostilities), the K\'kree 
immediately started a process of ensuring their cultural homogenity and 
stability. AND THIS IS WHAT M. LENTULI\'S REAL MANIPULATION WAS.

     While the K\'kree had always been a very conservative race, once they began 
these cultural pogroms they became a completely stagnant race. By being 
constantly on the lookout for \'Hiver-induced deviations\', they completely 
stamped out what little creativity and initiative did exist. It is no 
accident that, with the exception of the short-lived K\'kree-Vargr conflict 
of 1100 years ago, the K\'kree borders have been completely stable.

     So, after M. Lentuli\'s initial manipulation, and constant but subtle 
reminders by various manipulators over the centuries, the K\'kree have 
become a race completely afraid that any innovation or expansion is a sign 
of  "Hiver contamination". As long as we constantly maintain the quiet 
reminders, and don\'t let the K\'kree learn of the true nature of our 
manipulation, they will never again threaten our Federation.

     Yes, I see a question from the back. "So, since well more than 850 years 
have passed since our first contact, why haven\'t the K\'kree been 
civilized?". Good question. Well, studies have shown that the K\'kree would 
have been one of the easiest major races to manipulate, because of their 
proximity and cultural continuity. Unfortunately, M. Lentuli\'s 
manipulation, by locking the K\'kree into a single stagnant cultural model, 
has made the K\'kree almost possible to manipulate.

     Well thank you for your time. I hope you will all join me for next week\'s 
banquet and our keynote speech, "Ongoing Manipulations of the Third 
Imperium".

   Yes.

   Actually, you don\'t need to be so very precise.  You accelerate the
   meson until its lifetime becomes long enough to travel to the target
   with ease.  Once striking the target, the meson decelerates to
   non-relativistic speeds, where its lifetime reduces to normal (which
   is less than 30 nanoseconds, depending on the type of meson).  It
   thus decays almost instantly once it has stopped inside the target. 
   This is how meson "guns" work in reality, where they are used for
   brain surgery.

   A weapon needs even less precision than a meson scalpel.  The only
   real concern of the gunnery officer will be not to supply so much
   energy to the mesons that they punch through the target without
   stopping.

   Well, in a static gravitic (or electric) field, the charges do not
   radiate gravitons (or photons), so there is no graviton flow (or
   light).  Gravitational radiation only occurs when you have an
   expanding or contracting mass, as in the case of a supernova.  This
   is somewhat analogous to the fact that electromagnetic radiation only
   occurs when you have an oscilating electric charge, as in the case of
   an antenna or a hot gas molecule.

   If you are refering to /virtual/ graviton exchange, then the
   gravitons are passed back and forth between you and the planet.  Be
   warned, though, that neither I nor anybody else really understand
   quantum gravity.  Treating gravity like quantum electrodynamics
   inevitably results in violating general relativity.

   If I knew, I\'d be rich. 8^)  But carrying the analogy with
   electromagnetism a little further, one can imagine a type of "Faraday
   cage", a gravitic "conductor" that routes the gravitic field lines
   around your vehicle.  Fun stuff!

   Thnaks for asking physics questions; they are fun to think about.

     Ahh, now you\'re getting close to the truth. Why start digging up 
moldy-oldy conspiracy theories like the Templars or the Bavarian Illuminati 
when we already have the Hivers.

<plug> and see my previous post for tantalizing hints about Hiver 
manipulations of the Third Imperium </plug>

     Oh, while I\'m on the topic, if anyone of you have the time or inclination, 
doing a little bit of research on conspiracy theories is simply 
fascinating. A few suggestions:

GURPS Illuminati (still a terrible system, but a GREAT sourcebook),
Holy Blood, Holy Grail (mentioned by someone else, but worth another plug)
http://www.jbs.org (the John Birch Society online - read about how the 
Macarthy hearings really did discover commie spies in America),

and last, but definitely not least...

World Revolution, by Nesta Webster. A tremendously difficult book to find 
(I eventually got it through an inter-library loan from U of Pennsylvania), 
written in the 20s by some crazy woman who proceeds to explain how every 
event in the past 200 years is part of a Jewish-communist plot launched by 
Adam Weishaupt and the Bavarian Illuminati. AND SHE BELIEVED EVERY WORD OF 
IT!

     Why did I spend so much time and effort researching this stuff?

     You\'re not cleared for that.

Actually, how about a TL 6 squeeze bore ATR with tungsten ammo?

False. It is possible to make rigid joints at TL 8, as in the NewtSuit. At
higher TLs it may be possible to make microscopic-accordion joints or
shape-changing metals.

Moreover, even TL 8 flexible ballistic cloth resists impact as well as
several mm of steel. When you can karate-chop a tank in half, you will be
able to do the same to battle dress, but not before.

Why not then make an "immunity zone" around a jump drive so you can jump
cargo and passengers directly from planet to planet and not bother with all
this space travel stuff?

Why not make this distortion in front of the ship so the ship constantly
\'falls\' forward, with no need for reaction mass? Ta daa, Newton\'s laws
repealed!

Seriously, the hard part in explaining Traveller technology rationally is
not coming up with technobabble describing what happens, it\'s preventing
this technobabble from predicting all kinds of things which are NOT
Traveller technology.

    'from' => 'Jeff Harvey jharvey@nlci.com',
    'body' => 'I would like to thank everyone for debating the issue of cloning, that I
initiated.  It has certainly given me a lot to think about.  I am not
looking for a "Paranoia" type situation.  However, I was thinking of
cloning as being a "fountain of youth", to a degree, for the extremely
wealthy.  At this point, I\'m not certain how feasible this will be in
our futures, but RPG\'s are based on imagination and creativity, so I\'m
gonna run with mine.  No one ever said that Traveller was a
"hard-science" RPG.  Here are some ideas that I have for cloning "rules"
in Traveller.

1)  The cloning of sentient life forms is highly illegal.  Because
clones have a "blank slate" for a brain, is irrelevant.  "Humanity would
not allow a person to be kept unwillingly in stasis.  (I percieve that
clones would be kept in "improved low-berths".)  It would be akin to
slavery.  (Obviously this rule will require a great deal of expounding,
but this is a brief overview.)

2) Cloning by tech-level:

     TL-11:  Cloning of "food sources" is legal, and readily used
on                 many worlds.  Especially on high-population worlds.

     TL-12:  Illegal experimentation with cloning of "humans"
begins.                 Although, experimentation is based on cloning
"human"                   embryos, in an effort to justify this
experimentation as                 a way to fight infertility, several
clones are advanced                 to "full term".  99.6% of these
clones die within the                   first year.  It is unknown how
many of thes clones lived                 full lives.

     TL-13:  Cloning of human embryos becomes standard practice,
yet                 still illegal.  There is a high black-market
value                      placed on these embryos.  Somewhere around 10
MCr\'s.                    Experimentation on genetically enhanced clones
begins.  

     TL-14:  Various worlds begin allowing embryo cloning
for                        infertility patients.  A great deal of legal
and medical                 documentation must be filed and approved. 
This would be                 considered a "last chance".  These worlds
allowed this                  in an effort to fight the black-market,
allow taxation,                 prevent "unsavory" medical practices,
reduce cost, and                  for regulatory reasons.  Illegal
experimentation still                  takes place in "full term"
cloning.  Success depends                    upon the rate of growth,
length of growth, and final age                 of the clone. (i.e. a
"full-term" clone "grown" for one                 year to the age of one
year would have an 85% chance of                 survival) There is a 4%
reduction in success based on                   rate/length ratio. 
(i.e. A "full-term" clone "grown"                   FOR one year TO the
age of two years would have an 81%                  chance of survival. 
A "full-term" clone "grown" FOR one
                year to the age of 20 years would have a 5% chance
of                   survival.  A "full-term" clone "grown" FOR five
years                   TO the age of twenty years would have a 69%
chance of                   survival.)  Genetic enhancement of clones
reaches a                     success rate of 40%.

     TL-15:  The Imperium begins cracking down on cloning "labs",
but                 illegal experimentation continues.  The 4%
success                      reduction in the rate/length ratio is
reduced to 1%.                    Genetic enhancement success rates
increase to 65%.                      Experimentation begins in memory
recording, implantation                 and transfer (from one person to
another). Success rate                 is .05%.  This experimentation is
not illegal, but is                   still questionable in many
societies.  (They realize                    where this research is
heading.)

     TL-16:  The reduction in the rate/length ratio is reduced to
.1%                 with a one to one ratio equaling 97% success. 
Genetic                  enhancement success is increased to 88%. 
Memory                        Recording and Implantation (MRI) is
increased to 15%.                   With the inability to stop
experimentation regarding                    cloning, clone "mules" are
legalized on various worlds.                 "Mules" may not be held for
any reason once they have                   been given "instruction"
into the tasks that they were                  created to perform.  The
price of a clone "mule" is                     15 MCr\'s.  "Mules" are
owned by the purchaser, but the                  owner MUST treat a
"mule" the same as he would any other                 employee, with
regard to pay, working time, and resting                 time.  All
"mules" have full civilian rights with the                   exception
that they MUST work for their owners for a                    minimum of
30 years.  They are also granted the right to                 purchase
themselves from their owners at ANY time.                      (Yes, I
realize that some slavery issues pop up here,                   it could
make for some interesting conflict/scenarios.)

     TL-17:  MRI increases to 40%.  Genetic enhancement increases
to                 95%.

     TL-18:  MRI increases to 65%.


3)  Finding a lab that is willing to make a "personal replacement" clone
will be an Impossible Task of Streetwise (-2 DM).  An enabling skill of
Bribery: Impossible (.05 MCr base) will reduce Streetwise to formidable
(-1 DM).

These are a few thought I have right now.  Obviously this will be VERY
lengthy before it is finished.  These are a few minor thoughts that I
have right now, but it\'s late, and I\'m tired.  Many definitions will
need to be included as well as many, many rules regarding various
issues.  I am considering what attribute modifiers I should use and how
they could be "worked off" once the clone ages in the real world. 
Again, all thoughts are welcome.  Thank you in advance.

So all this talk on cloning (both here in in society in general) got me 
thinking...Strephon\'s "double" (that may not have been a double...that

the start of the Rebellion: Was he a clone, a robot/android or a person 
altered by plastic surgery (see Akira Kurosawa\'s brilliant film Kagemusha 
for a good backdrop to this aspect...).

The reason for asking: In working out possible plot threads for my

Actually they worked very well against the early panzers (marks I and II)   
and armoured cars. However, once armour plate got thicker the only place   
to apply the sticky bombs to any effect became the base of the tank (and   
you find someone willing to crawl under a moving enemy tank and attach a   
bomb!).

As I recall, the American paratroops mocked up something similar at   
Bastogne against tanks as they rose up to go over earthworks.

Unless the weapon is a shotgun or LAG, if the shot misses the intended   
target I just have the player roll the to-hit roll again once for each   
character around the target (closest character outwards) until the shot   
hits someone or we run out of characters to roll for.

Some of my friends apply minuses to the roll, increasing the minuses the   
further they get from the aiming point.

Of course, if the weapon is a shotgun or a LAG the damage gets shared out   
amongst everyone in the vicinity (including the intended target). Let   
no-one say I\'m not generous! ;-)

I have heard of people making each possible target roll against Dex to   
get out of the way of the round, but I always assumed it was more a case   
of luck than dexterity.

Hope this helps you Pierre.

So if a player ask you how the contrgrav works, you just answer "It works,
that\'s all! It\'s Traveller technology!"

Personnaly I much prefer give a \'Pseudo Science\' explaination even if it\'s
a bit stupid or really far from the reality. Truth, reality (whatever we
can call it) can only be seen or understood through an image of it
(theory). As we are playing in anther environment we can have the reality
we want. That doesn\'t mean that we don\'t have to find a image
(pseudo-thoeory in theis case ) to understand it.

Those explainations generate many roleplaying even more when I play my
engineer character than when I am the GM. 

Personnaly I find the Peter Brenton\'s explaination interesting, even if I
don\'t use it. He has an image of the process in his mind and that\'s the
main point. 

And I don\'t care if it\'s not Traveller. In fact if we are 200 on this list,
there are 200 different Traveller games.

    'topic' => 'Air superiority',
    'body' => 'I was wondering something about SL + Contra grav vs AF dogfight

The question is which configuration would have the best manoeuvrability and
by consequence the air superiority (assuming that the weapons are quite the
same type of course)

I\'m detailing a little bit what i mean.

A SL+CG (without CG it would fly like an iron...) move in athmosphere as it
would do in space, assuming it uses a part of it\'s propulsion to maintain
speed because of the surrounded air.=20
It\' acceleration is only given by it\'s propulsors. So if the ship/raft has
a G-rating of 3 he can only give a 3G burst in one direction.=20

Now for a AF plane. A simple 1G plane can use it\'s portance (I hope that\'s
the correct translation) to give a bigger acceleration than 1G in another
direction. I think (but I\'m not sure of the numbers _at all_) that a
fighter like the F16 can handle from 6 to 9G depending of the mass it
carries. Regarding it\'s speed it might not have a thrust higher than 1G.=20

The AF configuration seems to be more efficient in dogfight maneuvers. More
than that, the SL+CG ship have to turn himself to provide thrust in one
direction. Although not stated in FFS, we can assume that the propulsor can
be oriented from +/-10=B0 to help manoeuvers, This ship wouldn\'t have a high
dexterity.=20
That\'s remembers me the old Astero=EFds video game, where you had a ship
(actually just a triangle) which provides thrust in only one direction and
can turn on himself. It was very hard to manoever and usually the course
was finishing in a rock (the other players a very glad that I\'m not the
pilot of our starship :-)).=20
Assuming the flight computer is more than necessary in a SL+CG ship, the
trajectory corrections would usually mean that the ship is spinning in all
directions.=20
To overcome this problem, the ship would be equiped with mutiple propulsors
not only devoted to help the spin but also for regular thrust. The ship
don\'t have to turn on himself before providing main thrust. BTW I assume
that small propulsors are part of the hull and help the ship to rotate
before it can provide the main thrust which will slow down the ship itself.


So there are two quesitons :

1- What is your point of view on the air superiority of the AF
configuration on the SL+CG?

2- Would the AF+CG have a great advantage in manoevrability on standard AF
configuration?


P.S. All this thinking is build around a "regular propulsor" as Helpar or
propellors which provide thrust in only one direction. I don\'t know if
there is a orientable thuster agent (even in T4) which would reduces
partially the problem of spinning of the ship (thuster plates?)=20

        Indeed. I still haven\'t received M0. What has happened to the
planets with D,E,F atmospheres? Have they been changed? Could anybody check
e.g. Ar Chaa (Massilia 0932). In 1120, it had type D atmosphere.

        Yep. The MT TL table is much better. And, certainly, the detailed
tech level descriptions in the Referee\'s companion is not compatible with
the T4/CT TL table.

        No, it was also 2D-7+size in MT.

        There is something more. In T$, the descriptions of type A and B
starports are identical!. For instance, it says that a type B starport can
build starships. In CT/MT, type B starports could only build non-jump
spaceships. This would be a major change in the Traveller universe. Is it a
typo?

        So, OFFICIAL QUESTION(s): Is the world generation going to be
reworked in the Deluxe Edition? Are the type B starport description and the
rule for creating hydrosphere typos?

Hold it. If you\'re referring to the planaria experiments from the \'60\'s
(which lead Larry Niven to speculate about "RNA Injection Learning" in his
Tales of Known Space), you should know they were shown to be quite bogus. 

Experimenters repeatedly ran a bunch of planaria through a little T-shaped
\'maze\'; there was food at the left end of the \'T\' but not at the right end.
Soon the flatworms learned to go toward the left each time. Then the
scientists extracted RNA from the trained flatworms\' ganglia and injected
into the nerves of untrained flatworms. And what d\'ya know - in the T-maze,
the untrained flatworms now turned left more often than right!

Clearly the RNA encoded some form of learned behavior. And this behavior
could be passed on to others simply by injecting RNA into a creatures
nervous system. Hence Larry Niven\'s characters learning languages and such
by RNA-injection. Seemed logical enough at the time.

But sometime in the early \'80\'s (if I\'m not mistaken), someone took a good
look at these experiments and found a major flaw in the methodology.
Re-doing the experiments with proper controls showed that planaria injected
with *any* RNA, whether from \'trained\' planaria or even from *untrained*
planaria, tended to turn left more often than right. They weren\'t learning
from RNA-encoded knowledge at all - they were just messed up by the RNA
injections!

If this is not what you\'re referring to, do let us know. The closest thing
to molecular encoded learned behaviors I\'ve ever read about was a study
that showed that certain sensory stimuli could cause certain genes to be
switched on and off in birds - but it\'s a huge leap from there to
biomolecular memory storage.

Anybody out there have more information on this?

I don\'t think you read very carefully.  The problem causing misjumps is
the area *around* the ship, not the area the ship itself occupies.  So the
explanation goes like this; since you cannot nullify the effects of
gravity in an area the size of a small gas giant, you cannot use this
device to make jumping from the surface safe.

The distortion can only be placed directly above the gravitic device, and
has a certain mass limitation such that in order to power the thing
properly would require more power than a power plant it could affect could
produce.

did that make sense?

   Sounds good, but I suspect that they would commute to orbit every

Why do you include the LAG in with a shotgun?

And for that matter, why did the 3I spend so very much effort holding Five
Sisters/SM?  It\'s beyond a Sword Worlds chokepoint, *past* unincorporated
District 268 (in the CT era), strategically all but useless...but Andor
and Candory, the purported Droyne homeworlds, are smack dab in the middle
of it.  And right next door are those Darrians with their relic TL17 toys.
The plot thickens.  Was the push toward the Marches a race to Five
Sisters?  Was the Darrien Star Trigger disaster a piece of sabotage by
Grandfather...or someone else?  Why aren\'t the Zhos more interested in
pushing rimward?  The truth is out there...

Exactly.  Suddenly the Darrians become the key to it all...they\'re
starting to take on a tinge of Asimov\'s Foundation, small, weak...but
maybe running everything in SM and Corridor and perhaps beyond, subtly,
from behind the scenes.  Of course, their own puppet masters may well be
just one subsector to trailing...

Imagine if the Darrians really prop up the Sword Worlds as a buffer
against too much Imperial and Zhodani prying.  Now *there* is a conspiracy
theory!

Oh, undoubtedly.  I would guess that they were on the verge of keying in
on Grandfather\'s interstellar data grid, still perhaps in use by Droyne
and other operatives.  Something had to be done to smack \'em down.

Oh, *shit*.

Hivers: Five-fold symmetric, shadowy manipulators, creators of countless
tiny spawn.
Great Old Ones: Ditto.

Droyne: Hunched, winged, ancient beyond calculation, working secretly to
bring about unknown ends.
Cthulhu: Ditto.

Perhaps the Necronomicon preserves a racial memory of the great conflict
in which Grandfather and his minions kicked a colony of Hivers off ancient
Earth, replacing their program of manipulation with his own?  How long
have the Hivers been spacefarers, anyway?  And can we trust the official
answer to this question?

The planaria studies were flawed.  Others have been done with aplysia
(sea-hares, considerably more complex with brains having ~10,000 neurons --
still a walk in the park compared to mammalian brains) and mantle-opening
behavior that were not, I believe, similarly flawed.  Ugh, it\'s been
_years_ since I looked at this stuff; I think my old Kandel & Schwartz
(Principles of Neural Science?) talks about this.  

I don\'t know that there is any strong evidence for the molecular memory
hypotheses.  CNS neurons do have many more Golgi complexes than do other
cells; they manufacture and store proteins like crazy.  There\'s also
excellent evidence that microtubules in the axons of nerve cells actively
transport specific proteins depending on the activity of the cell.  Now,
whether this manufacture, storage, and transport is indicative of some sort
of memory mechanism or is merely the result of cellular wear-and-tear is
not at all clear (to say the least).  In the scope of a TL15+ Traveller
game though, I think you _could_ posit some local molecular memory storage
within each cell and the scanning technique I described earlier.  The
proteins (every bit as informationally dense, more durable, and often more
compact than the DNA that codes for them, btw) are essentially a sort of
synaptic map for each neuron: so, given a similar brain, semi-magically
re-creating the proteins in each cell (again, on an aggregate probabilistic
basis; you\'re not going to get every neuron right!) could cause the CNS
neurons to create very similar synapic mappings, thus recreating very
similar memories and behavior patterns.

Well, that\'s probably more goopy neuroscience stuff than most folks here
wanted to know. :)

     Good question...this was never clearly elucidated, at least in the
sources I have (I\'m missing the \'Arrival Vengeance\' adventure which
apparently has some things about what Strephon was doing out there so far
from core, just what the heck Longbow was, and why they were doing it, and
maybe some stuff about his \'doubles\')

     Reading between the lines in survival margin (where ALL the
good info is, in that book), though, I would tend to think that they were
clones, not robots or surgically altered doubles. Several mentions are
made throughout Traveller canon about cloning humans being highly illegal,
as well as highly intelligent robots and/or AI\'s.  That the Strephon that
appeared after the assasination being the \'real\' one is made pretty clear,
imo by the excerpts from his writings in SM.

     There\'s a Robert Heinlein novel about an actor taking over for
another politician, I think it\'s called Double Star.  For a humorous look
at this sort of thing, check out the movie \'Moon over Parador\'; Richard
Dreyfuss takes over for some bananna republic \'Presidente for Life\' and
wreaks havok with the country.

Nope, this trick only works for charged mesons.  The whole beauty of
Traveller\'s neutral-meson guns is that they don\'t interact *at all* (well,
a vanishingly small amount, really) until the decay happens.  If passing
into solid matter slowed the mesons (as is the case with charged ones),
then armor would be a defense against meson guns.

As part of our work on Pocket Empires, it was necessary for us to know 
the answer to these questions, too.  Are A and B starports the same now?  
What about the high atmosphere types?  The high government types?  What 
happened to Standard, Tainted atmospheres?

Tim Brown told me that T4 deluxe would include the right info on all 
these things - i.e., A and B are not the same, Standard, Tainted 
atmospheres will be there, etc.

Chalk it all up to errata, in other words.

At least, that\'s what Tim said.  Hopefully that is what Marc has planned 
as well.

The rules mention no problem with using a BG in a gravity well - which is

(There *are* problems with BGs and gravity, but I try not to think about

Issue of semantics, as I see it. Whether the actual detonator is seperate,
or the 
substance that must be in
physical contact with the detonator for it to be primed is kept seperate, no
difference.
If it makes you feel better, just call the "detonator strip" we keep
referring to "C4/TNT/
whatever" and call the little "9-volt" the "blasting cap/fuse/whatever". I
see no difference
between having a seperate detonator, and having a built-in detonator that
must be
"primed" by a seperate object brought into physical (if brief) contact.
Especially when
the person carrying it is totin\' a FGMP, for crissakes. <g> 

And has probably disabled the safety, as well <g>

Actually, he\'s right.  Pions still interact far more than traveller
gives them credit for.  In order to have them penetrate even a meter
of matter we\'d have to invoke some kind of control over them aside
from accelerating them to reletivistic velocities.  Luckily by meson
gun TLs we have strong and weak force control to use as magic for
this.

   Well, firing a heavy, decaying particle into a ship is like firing an
   armor-piercing, exploding bullet at a vehicle.  Of course armor
   affects charged mesons, but not as much as it affects light particles
   (electron accelerators) or slow particles (heavy ion accelerators,
   like the AHL has) or stable particles (like plasma guns) or, most
   particularly, neutral bosons (like lasers and neutral meson
   accelerators).

   Neutral mesons will interact with matter /more/ readily than charged
   mesons, because charged mesons are stable with respect to
   electromagnetic fields, while neutral mesons are not.  In fact, early
   meson researchers used to call many neutrals "heavy photons" because
   of their propensity for electromagnetic interactions.  To keep a
   neutral from interacting with matter, you\'d have to damp the
   electromagnetic fields in the matter.  Since a definition of matter
   is "electrons and nuclei interacting with each other via
   electromagnetism", this is a pretty tall order.  If you could damp
   electromagnetism in your opponant\'s armor, you would have a
   devastating weapon without needing "no stinkin\' mesons!"

   Neutral mesons have extraordinarily short lifetimes, again due to
   their succeptability to electromagnetic decay. A neutral meson gun
   will need to accelerate its particles to about 2 million times the
   energy of a charged meson gun to get the same range.  This is a
   lesser objection, since even the lightest charged mesons will need a
   ridiculously high energy to travel for ship-combat distances (but
   neutral mesons will need two million times the aforementioned
   ridiculous energy).  On the other hand, if you believe that Trav
   engineers can control the Weak Nuclear Force, then they could make
   /charged/ mesons as stable as they please, but /neutral/ mesons would
   still decay via the Electromagnetic Force.

   Without some sort of magic, a neutral meson accelerator will be
   nothing more than a /very/ short wavelength laser-like weapon. IMHO,
   the charged meson is a better canditate for an armor piercing weapon.

   Of course, if you like magic guns, there\'s no reason not to have them
   in a game!  This has been just another unsolicited physics lesson
   from...

Actually, it\'ll only have 2 G\'s as one G is required to keep it in the air
at a constant altitude.  (Actually, the amount required to maintain altitude
will equal to the local surface gravity value.)

Not quite.

The F-16 can produce up to 9g of instantaneous acceleration due to it\'s
speed and turning radius.  The acceleration often refered to is the conbined
effect of gravity and centriputal acceleration of the aircraft.  It is not a
function of the mass of the aircraft.  However the mass of the aircraft do
have an effect of the energy disspation rate of the aircraft (more on this
later.)

That is actually a fair model of newtonian movement.  This is what can be
expected from a space ship to ship combat scenario where both ships have the
same starting vector.  In an atmosphere you\'ll be constantly decelerating if
you do not maintain thrust in the direction you\'re travelling, either
linearly or radially (i.e. spinning).

Both are just as good if designed properly.

>2- Would the AF+CG have a great advantage in manoevrability on standard AF
>configuration?

Maybe.

If all else were keep the same (weight, endurance, maintance, cost, warload,
etc) the AF+CG will not have to fight gravity.  If real fighters do not have
to use any of the lift from their wings to keep the aircraft in the air,
then they can maintain a 90 degree bank angle all day long in a dogfight.
Today, if an aircraft did this, it\'ll stall and crash if it\'s kinetic energy
fell too low.

If the CG model you\'re using is actually a thrust medium, then there are
other maneuvering advantages that can be exploited in a close in fight.

>P.S. All this thinking is build around a "regular propulsor" as Helpar or

Control that can reduce spin can be found on Hovercraft or Air Cushioned
Vehicles.  A rudder is used to control the spin/drift before it gets out of
control if you\'re using a "regular propulsor."  If you\'re using the
"thruster plate," you can always mount small TP\'s around the vehicle in
arrangement similar to what\'s used on spacecrafts.  Then you just fire them
as need to correct course deviation.

 How about a wealthy Psionic family that doesn\'t want to risk losing their
power by diluting the Psi gene with common stock? Extensive gene therapy
could combine \'talents\' to create a more powerful heir. Weird, but possible.

     Ahh, you poor, ignorant soul. My collection of all 7 Alien Modules are 
like children to me- they are simply that useful.

     In a nutshell, manipulation is psychohistory. Dig out a copy of Asimov\'s 
Foundation series, and that\'ll give you the idea. 
Manipulation/psychohistory is the art of performing one single, solitary 
act and thereby influencing an entire society.

     Oh, despite their names, the Hivers do not live in hives, and are not at 
all what that name might imply (bringing to mind bees and other mindless 
insects). Also, the Hivers are completly, 100% non-spionic. They can 
neither learn psionics, nor be affected by psionic powers.

Some mapping ideas I\'ve found useful:

1) A normal map, except that where a system exists, 
shade in the ENTIRE hex. It immediatly makes mains,
clusters, scatters, voids, etc. stand out, to give
the players (and ref) a better sense of the astrographic
character of a region. Works best on a large-scale (sector)
map.

2) As (1), but color-coding for tech level, or at least tech-category
(i.e. High-stellar, low-stellar, preindustrial, etc.).

3) A time-propagation map (this is more of a GM tool).
To help provide atmosphere, when my players came out of jump
and into port, I gave them an update of the latest
TNS bulletins (handwritten or retyped, so that it wouldn\'t
be obvious which ones were mine and which had been 
published in JTAS). Remember, "latest" didn\'t mean by 
calender date, but by the most recent ones to arrive at
this world. That means accounting for message travel time
from its world of origin. Since your sig quotes the Traveller 
Adventure, I\'m guessing you have it -- you\'ll find the
propagation system I used in there.  For frequent news
systems-of-origin (e.g., Regina, Rhylanor), you can make
maps with concentric bands showing to which systems a
message has travelled in X-many weeks. For less
frequent sources you can do the same, or just fudge it
based on what you\'ve established for the frequent sources.

4) Off-dimension maps, to remind people that space doesn\'t
end where the map does. Make maps on hexpaper that doesn\'t
follow the standard 8x10 hex/subsector, 32x40 hex/sector
grid. For my several campaigns based around the Traveller
Adventure (with different groups, naturally) I custom-made
a map that centered on Aramis subsector, but also showed
about 12 parsecs in every direction around it. This means 
all the neighboring subsectors were shown -- not just
Regina and Rhylanor, but also the nearby space in Deneb
and Gvurrdon sectors (if you don\'t have the info, just
roll up your own). This way there was no artificial 
map-edge border, just the broad front of the Imperial
border and the small vargr states beyond it; worlds that
looked isolated were actually part of a small cluster 
or even a main in the neighboring subsector; etc.
Even if the PCs always went where I was prodding them to go
(via charters, rumors, fudging the rolls on where their
best cargos were bound for, the ususal GM tricks),
they had much more of a sense of the space around them
and that they could go anywhere in it than with the 
standard sector/subsector maps.

Hope this helps,

JB

     According to the MDI, it didn\'t work that well <g>.  The No. 74
grenade was originally devloped privately, and it had a host of safety
problems.  The adhesive was similar in appearance to bird-lime.  It had a
charge of 1lb 4oz. of nitro.

     The grenade was prone to misfires and the explosive to leaking and
breakage.  It was forced on the Ordnance Board (long story), who were
utterly unimpressed with it.

     It was used by partisans for demolition in Europe.  There are no
records of it having been used in combat.  It lasted until 1951 (on
paper), but no one saw one after 1944.  They had better anti-tank and
anti-personel grenades after 1941.

     Laterish!

This is a misinterpretation of the CT rules. Or rather a selective reading.
The rule you\'re talking about does allow a starship to power it\'s capacitors
through black globe energy absorbsion and to jump when the capacitors has
been charged that way PROVIDED THE SHIP HAS A FULL LOAD OF JUMP FUEL!
(Emphasis mine). So your instant super explorers are not possible even under
CT. You need the fuel in any case.

What is interesting about that rule is that apparently _none_ of the jump fuel 
is used to fuel the jump (Ta-dah!). My favorite explanation is that the 
various jump dimensions are a lot denser than empty space and that a ship
can\'t just break through the interdimensional barrier into it (that would
be kinda like slaming into a water surface at high velocity: the usually
pliant water suddenly behaves like solid rock). Instead, the "fuel" is 
actually used to create a small "bubble" in jump-space that allows the
ship to slip into it. The bubble only stays open for a few seconds, so the
capacitors must be carefully syncronized to discharge the moment the bubble
is ready. And the reason why more "fuel" is needed to make higher jumps is
that higher jump dimensions are denser. And refined fuel is better than
unrefined because the exact [physical property] of the bubble must be known
to tune the jump field properly. Fuel contaminants introduce random
variations in the [whatever] and increase the risk of misjump.

So why call it fuel if it isn\'t used as fuel? Because is is also used as
fuel for the power plant. Only technicians and nitpickers call it "access
mass".

I don\'t claim that this explanation is totally compatible with everything
that\'s previously been said about jump drives (especially in MT), but I do
think it maintains the idiocyncrasies of the CT jump drive while preventing
most of the obvious problems with the standard explanation.

Simple. What happens when you only have X joules pof capacity left, but
get hit by something with an energy of 2X? :-)

*You* have to decide *before it hits* whether the next shot will kick

You must be misreading something. Everyone treats the Darrians with kid
gloves because they think the Darrians *do* have Star Triggers (yes,
multiple!) and don\'t want to be on the receiving end of a demonstration.

Work out the acceleration, and the time in barrel implied by it. You
get a time so short that it really doesn\'t make any difference.

For example, let\'s assume 5000 m/s, from a 1 meter barrel. 
 D=.5AT^2         V=AT
 1=.5*A*T^2         5000=AT
 2=AT^2             5000/T=A
           2=(5000/T)T^2
           2=5000T^2/T
           2=5000T
           4e-4=T

The dart takes 400 *microseconds* to traverse the barrel.

That\'s close enough to "instantaneous" for humans.

I still think that it\'d be a damn good idea for IG or *somebody* to get
Norton to approve a "sourcebook" for SF RPGs based on her SF books. I\'d

Only trouble is, IR is one of the most popular areas for weapons grade
lasers. And high powered masers can ruin your day. Pump enough power
into *any* wavelength and it is dangerous. And anything from the
microwaves on up can be made into a beam weapon suitable for use in space.

I suggest that you read "DeathKiller" by Spider Robinson. He brings up
a lot of the drawbacks of memory read/write technology.

For one thing, this would have to include the ability to *erase*
memories. And that brings up a very important point regarding
identity. What are you without your memories, the memories
(experiences) that have shaped your personality. There\'s a reason why
the nastiest punishment SF has ever come up with is considered to be
mindwipe. 

And as far as feeding in memories, that can be a boon for education, or
it can be the end of all *possible* freedom. Consider a dictatorship
where they can drag you in and read your memories to find out if you\'re
realy loyal. And where if you aren\'t, they can re-write you until you
*are*. 

That\'s why mindwrite/mindwipe technology is *not* something to be
casually introduced into Traveller.

And then there\'s the fact that once you have realtime memory read
technology and realtime (or better) memory write technology, you have
"mechanical telepathy" for all intents and purposes. 

That\'s a technology *crucial* to Vernor Vinge\'s "Singularity". And we
need to keep Traveller well *away* from any such technology. Or else we
need to adopt something like Vinge\'s background for "A Fire Upon the
Deep", where the laws of physics restrict tech levels!

No, it emits a steady stream of vapor in lots of directions through
lots of holes. Or perhaps it just emits a burst of vapor (it take some
tests to find out which works best).

But what makes you think the vapour would cool into drops? Sure, it\'ll
eventually condense, but in a vacuum, the vapor cover cover a *lot* of
distance before running into anything.

Point defense lasers only make things *worse*, as they\'ll do a *better*
job of vaporizing the metal, and thus getting everything in line of
sight plated.

It\'s unlikely to react much with the suit. Sodium *is* reactive, but
most suit materials aren\'t terribly reactive. However, now that you
mention it, I recall that hot akali metals *do* react with
fluorocarbons (they replace the *carbon*, NOTHING will replace the
fluorine!) 

So fluorocarbons would become carbon plus KF/NaF. But the actual heat
energy of the atoms impacting the suit would be low. So most likely
result is just "plating".

Another possibility, for the really fool-hardy is a sodium vapor "gun".
Sort of like a paint sprayer. A couple of "bursts. and the enemy looks
like a Christmas ornament. :-)

Actually just repressurize with water vapor, wait an hour or two for
the shine to go away, and add nitrogen. Then hose down the walls while
wearing suits. The (dilute!) hydroxide solution can easily be handled
by the reclamation system.

Remember, we\'re dealing with a film a few atoms thick in most places.

> Oh, and your stores chief is going to be a nervous individual.

Not *too* nervous. You keep them in vacuum sealed containers, natually.

You *could* try the same thing with things like titanium, except that
it wastes a lot of energy vaporizing it, and it\'s a royal pain to clean
up.

It\'s like the Subspace concept which is defined as an alternative
possibility for FTL travel. The subspace concept also suggest that waves
can travel though it, which is a enormous change to the Traveller background.

You are right. This explaination isn\'t the cannon but what is the cannon?.
Maybe several different technologies can coexists in a Traveller univers

   "Zhodani" comes from "Zhdant", the name of the homeworld.

   "Vilani" comes from "Vland".

   By extension, "Solomani" comes from a word like "Solmant".  

   I don\'t know what solmant means, but I would guess that it originally
   meant something like "peace" or "unity", because Hiroshi used the
   word Solomani to mean "all men" when he was addressing his new,
   second Imperium.  Later, racists introduced folk etymologies that
   claimed that the word came from "men of Sol" or "sole men"; by 1100,
   the word refered to men of Terran ancestry, or to members of a racist
   political party founded on Capital after the civil war.  The true
   etymology of "Solomani" is just another one of those intriguing
   mysteries that Marc has left scattered about his universe. 8^)

   (If you tried to coin a word from "Terra", our homeworld, it would be
   something like "Terora\'i" or "Terirani".  "Sol" would go to "Osoli"
   or "So\'oli" or "Sosoli" or something; I don\'t really have enough
   examples to deduce the grammatical rule for such "odd" place names!)

I\'m guessing this is a reply to Bob Sanders post.  His ship combat system
is remarkably close to mine, so for starters you can visit

  http://www.cs.odu.edu/~garriss

and look for the Simple Space Combat System (SSCS).  It\'s well organized
and should be easy to follow.  Bob and are starting a project to integrate
our systems together and create a new one designed especially for groups
who don\'t want to mess with hex maps and such (ie PBeM games).  We\'ll let
TML know when we\'re ready for a peer review.

And the system will be built around T4 damage values.  You\'ll have to
supply the conversion to TNE yourself.

Here I thought Solomani was derived from "Sol", the Latin name for
Earth\'s sun. Thus Solomani means "man from the Sol system".

        As usual, comments are extremely welcome.

================================================================================
HISTORY OF THE GEONEE

From Ancient Times to Year Zero (Part 1)

     The following historical summary of the Geonee race was written by Eneri
Garirmishaa, History Ph.D., and published by the University of Garency
(Massilia 1133) in the imperial year 14.
================================================================================

     The Geonee are frequently considered arrogant by the average sophont in
Massilia sector. This impression frequently comes from the misunderstanding
of their culture. And this culture arises from a distinctive history. One
should not forget that the Geonee have inhabited all their worlds since more
than ten thousand years ago, being the only human race with an interstellar
culture when the Vilani explorers first adventured in the sector.

Early History

     Despite the fact that the Geonee claim to be the Ancients themselves, the
most widely accepted theory states that, as all other human races, they were
brought  from humanity\'s original homeworld by the Ancients around 300,000
years ago.
     Their destination world was Shiwonee (Massilia 1430), today geologically
unstable, with a large quantity of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.
     Some geological evidences have given rise to suggestive historical
theories, which essentially state that Shiwonee\'s current geological
instability is the result of Ancient\'s manipulation during the Final War
that destroyed them. Nevertheless, these theories have failed to gather
enough evidences to be seriously considered.
     Regardless of its origin, it seems proven that Shiwonee\'s instability has
had a great impact on the Shiwonee culture, and, specially, on their
inclination towards technology. Early Geonee tribal communities were
frequently affected by natural disasters, a situation which gave high value
to technical skills and technological advantages.
     On the other hand, Shiwonee\'s climatic cycles forced the Geonee to adopt a
nomadic lifestyle that has also shaped their culture.
     Paleoantropologists place the date of the rise of the modern Homo Geonensis
around -15,000. Scripture first appeared thousand years after that. The
first written record is The Chronicle of the Fall, a text which apparently
gathers legends transmitted via oral transmission. According to these
legends, the Geonee were survivors of a civilization "from the stars" that
was destroyed in a Great War.
     Other conserved texts allow us to establish the existence of a small
network of agricultural communities around the year -13,900. The plains of
Nardaloo, the biggest continent, were the place where the first cities were
built... and destroyed by a great earthquake which geologists have dated in
- -13,660.

The Trillian Empire

     For a long period after that, only minor archaeological evidences of the
primitive Geonee cultures have been found. Then, starting around the year
- -12,700, a seminomad civilization left extensive written records with which
true history starts.
     This civilization, known as the "Trillian Empire", constructed hundreds of
villages and developed a communication and exploration network which
eventually encompassed the whole continent of Nardaloo.
     The Trillian Empire based its development on the possibility to move
relatively large amounts of population between villages as the climatic
conditions changed. This was possible thanks to the construction, upkeeping
and defense of a network of roads.
     A set of five "cities" formed the capital of the Empire. As the temperate
zone moved, the population also moved to the next city, leaving the others
under the protection of minimal garrisons.
     The "capital" population has been estimated in 50,000 people around the
year -12,500.
     The Trillian Empire lasted more than thousand years, but eventually
collapsed after a bloody civil war.

     Around the year -11,500, half a dozen of seminomad nations, rapidly
approaching TL 3, disputed the temperate zones of Nardaloo. These nations
showed most of the features of the current Geonee, including the dominant
role of the Geonee males. The tradition of "kidnapping marriages" can be
traced back to this era, as it is thought that some of the minor
tribe-nations had the custom of raiding others to capture women.
     Population pressures led to long range exploration, and the second
continent, Grandaal, was discovered. Explorers were shocked to discover a
group of primitive cultures based on a matriarchic system, and living in
communities with strange winged creatures with the capability of becoming
invisible: the Chirpers.
     Grandaal was colonized by the Nardaloo nations, and the primitive cultures
were defeated after a series of wars. Nevertheless, the discovery of the
Chirpers and the absortion of the matriarcal cultures had the effect of
creating new rituals and customs, which are probably the origin of the
modern "bond-maker" role of Chirpers.

The Volcanic Winter

     After several centuries of exploration, a small number of TL 4 nations
covered Shiwonee\'s surface. Some wars took place, but in the overall the
nations concentrated on their own development. Around year -10,700, Shiwonee
could be qualified as TL 5. Then, progress was deterred by an increase in
the geological activity: the explosion of at least six volcanoes in
different locations of the world caused the pollution of the atmosphere with
huge amounts of ashes. This had the effect of blocking solar light and heat,
producing a "nuclear winter" effect. Temperatures decreased below zero
degrees and most of the local flora and fauna died out. Civilization almost
collapsed.
     Fifty years later, when the effects of this volcanic winter diminished, the
survivors started once again to reconstruct their culture. Technical
knowledge had been crucial for survival, and was even more important for
reconstruction. Technicians were the most important members of society, a
position that they still hold.
     After the volcanic winter, Shiwonee population was scarce, and it took a
long time to establish again large communities.

The Meeralo Council

     In year -9,940, according to written reports, the representatives of the 18
largest communities of Shiwonee met at Meeralo, then a prosper city. They
agreed to establish the basis for world government and form a central body
capable of settling disputes among communities and enforcing some world-wide
laws: the Meeralo Council.
     This Council started as the meeting of the representatives of the
communities, but, in the following millennium, evolved towards a form of
coordination organism, formed by 18 distinguished married men. The different
communities retained their independence and disctintive indentity, but the
Meeralo Council handled common affairs. Among these common affairs was the
analysis of recovered antique technology, in fact Ancient artifacts.

        Again, comments are extremely welcome.

================================================================================
HISTORY OF THE GEONEE

From Ancient Times to Year Zero (Part 2)

     The following historical summary of the Geonee race was written by Eneri
Garirmishaa, History Ph.D., and published by the University of Garency
(Massilia 1133) in the imperial year 14.
================================================================================

The Space Era

     In year -9,300, Shiwonee was a TL 9 world, and the Meeralo Council
sponsored the Space Service, which explored much of the Shiwonee system. The
declared goal was to "travel again among the stars".
     In -9,270, a space mission met a derelict, an Ancient Starship, in one of
the planetoid belts of the system. After 30 years of research, the Geonee
were able to copy the Jump Drive technology and build the first starships.
     The only world at Jump-1 distance from Shiwonee was visited and named
Prindee (1330), which means "promise". Despite the unappealing conditions
(low gravity, tainted atmosphere), a small colony was established.
     Taking Prindee as an intermediate stop, a small fleet of Jump-1 starships,
capable of making two consecutive jumps, explored the Stenardee Cluster.
Starting with a small base at Stenardee (1130), the whole cluster was
promptly colonized.
     At Lagna (1029), the first colonists discovered remnants of Ancient/Geonee
origin, including Geonee skulls, finally proving the interstellar origin of
the Geonee race. These evidences have been disregarded by non-Geonee
scholars. The Lagna Archaeology Museum holds part of the rests even today.

The Geonee Empire

     In -9,100, following a strong debate on the future of the colonies, a
member of the Meraloo Council was able to gain enough support to force a
more centralized form of government and declared the Geonee Empire. He was
confirmed Emperor Bradasee I by the Meraloo Council, which survived as a
consultative organism.
     The empire emphasized space exploration, and, 20 years later, most of the
Shiwonee and Shokee subsectors had been explored. Most of the worlds were
empty, but a few held some surprises for the Geonee.
     Among these surprises was the presence of Chirpers at Theradway (Massilia
1534), the remnants of an extinguished human (non-Geonee) race at Tanny
(1238), and the presence of an intelligent minor alien race at Llyrn (0931),
then at TL 3.

Contact with the Vilani

     In year -9,000, an even bigger surprise shocked the Geonee, when they were
contacted by scouts of a starfaring human race: the Vilani. The meeting was
also a shock to the Vilani, as they had supposed to be the only race with
Jump Drive.
     The first contacts with the Vilani were full of misunderstandings and
suspicacies. The Vilani legends of fearful God-rulers in the distant past
made the Geonee think that the Vilani were a slave race of their own
ancestors. On the other hand, the Geonee legends about their origins
reminded the Geonee precisely of those feared God-rulers.
     When the cultural exchange was more advanced, the strange views that the
Vilani had about technology (the patent system, the restrictions on
research) led the Geonee to think that the Vilani were a stagnating society.
     Even after contact with the Vilani, the Massilia sector was full of empty
worlds, and the Geonee expansion continued. In -8,700, a colony was
established as far as Forquee (1719), 13 parsecs coreward from Shiwonee.
     In -8,600, the Massilia sector was under the formal supervision of the
Sharushid Vilani bureau. Traders from this bureau discovered that the first
Geonee Jump Drive had been copied from a derelict of unknown origin, and,
after that, the Vilani ceased to consider the Geonee an important race. The
Geonee argued that the vessel was not of unknown origin, but rather an
antique ship of the time the Geonee themselves travelled among the stars.
     But the Geonee were not very much worried about the Vilani beliefs. In the
year -8,500, they had an interstellar society at TL 10, with some TL 11
achievements, and got their hands full with exploration, trade, and
technical research.
     Parahee (2934), 15 parsecs trailing from Shiwonee, was settled in -8,400 as
an outpost to coordinate long range exploration of the Delphi sector. At the
moment, the Geonee had twenty colonies and around thirty outposts.

The First Confederation

     In -8,300, the Geonee Empire was oversized. The centralized structure was
inefficient and the more distant colonies payed little attention to the
Emperor\'s orders. When Emperor Sadahee III denied an autonomy request from
Forquee, the colonies revolted. The fleets loyal to the Emperor fighted the
rebel colonies for ten years, with little ground combat, and finally Sadahee
III renounced the throne. The Geonee Confederation was born.
     The Meeralo Council assumed the government in Shiwonee, and Sadahee was
granted life membership.
     During the Colonial Revolt, the Vilani remained neutral, but Sharurshid
increased commercial activity in Massilia, which resulted in heavy losses to
the Geonee.
     The Confederation granted almost total autonomy to the most distant
colonies as Forquee. The Vilani pressed the Confederation to join the Ziru
Sirka, but the request was never seriously taken into account by the Geonee.
Both the Vilani and the Geonee were heavily involved in the exploration,
settlement and development of worlds in Massilia sector and close subsectors
in Zarushagar, Core, Diaspora, and Delphi. Rivalries were primarily centered
on trade, and, although occasional skirmishes occurred, the relationship
between the two starfaring races were peaceful.
     In -7,100, the Geonee were a TL 11 society, although the technology for
Jump-2 had not been developed yet. When the Vilani acquired it, they kept
the knowledge strictly in Vilani hands, much to the Geonee dismay.
     Some Geonee scholars defend the theory that undercover Vilani agents
prevented the discovery of Jump-2 by the Geonee by kidnapping certain
researchers and sabotaging key experiments, but this theory has little base.
     Although the nomadic nature of the Geonee made possible that Geonee
communities settled as far as Lishun, the Confederation maintained loose
ties with these settlements and its true territory never encompassed more
than the equivalent of four subsectors in Massilia.
     In -5,100, the Vilani started the Consolidation Wars to force all the
"minor" races to join the Ziru Sirka. The Geonee Confederation resisted by
all means, starting what is known as "The Two Hundred Years War". The Geonee
mobilized as a whole against the Vilani, causing them heavy casualties and
even forcing them to retreat from central Massilia for decades, but,
finally, Vilani war tactics (that included nuking whole worlds) and the
Jump-2 were decisive. The Geonee were defeated in -4,900, and their worlds
incorporated into the Ziru Sirka.

Even with grav focus, diffraction effects will cause far-IR (100 micron) lasers
to have too much beam spread to do damage at space combat ranges; mm or cm-wave
masers will be even worse off, unl;ess the emitter is
100s of m in diameter.

And, of course, if you can change the allowed wavelength range rapidly,
you can scan it around at random over a wide range (You only need a channel
a few MHz wide for active sensors or commo), and speed-of-light-lag
will prevent the enemy from telling what wavelength you\'re allowing through
in time to hit you. 

Passive sensors should probably suffer a moderately severe penalty through
a white globe, though, since limiting them to only far-IR wavelengths 
cuts down on signal-to-noise and information...

Incorrect (i think, depending on your definition) The solomani had a

Now, back to your regular TML question:

What are some more ideas for how to handle The Protectors / Templars, 
in M0? 

Strong/weak?
Open/closed?
Active/passive?

Based on their history, how would the resident voice (Craig;))for the
Templars like to see them handled?  Nobles with a mission, or ... what?

Looking for ideas!

Hi Bruce,

When the Gov/LL errors are corrected, the data will indeed be posted to 
IG\'s web site. Of that much I have been assured.

However, I haven\'t heard any projected dates for when this is to be done. 
I know Marc is currently working on T4 Deluxe, as well as working with 
every designer who is producing supplements for Traveller, to ensure a 
consistency of vision. I don\'t know when he has the FS correction work 
scheduled for.

But, as soon as I am told a projected date, I\'ll let you know.

Okay, I\'ll talk...

The STar Trigger was not even a weapon. It was a probe that used liquid tungsten to cool 
itself and a meson communicator to report on the inside of the sun as the probe dove 
deeper. Then something happened; the mesons reacted or something and suddenly the star 
sloughed off some matter and a heap of radiation.
It was not a weapon (nor was it a cookbook)

I beleive that Carlos is refeering to Massila Sector.  The Geonee indeed
were the only human race "native" to that area to have FTL travel (even if
they got it from Ancient artifacts.)

The Solomani met the Vilani on their *first* interstellar jump. so you
really can\'t say that they had an interstellar community.  as for the
Zhodani, I\'m unaware of any canonical source indicating that they even knew
of each other\'s existance, let alone met.

Even better.. we have a fiercely independant, exceedingly Solomani culture
pushed right up against the center of the Droyne/Ancients riddle.. Could the
SW be a hotbed of Templar activity in the Classic Era?  Picture it.. The
Darrians, who possibly know that secrets of the Ancients, and the Sword
Worlds, the result of of 2000 years of trying to piece together the mystery!
They both now the legendary homeworld must be nearby, but are too wary of
the other to make an overt move.. then the Imperium comes in and makes a mad
dash for the contested region!  

Take a look at Five Sisters.. Andor and Candory are ringed by Imperial Navy
bases sitting on Amber Zone worlds.  In fact, 8 of the subsector\'s 27 worlds
are Amber!  What is so dangerous to earn these levels of Naval staffing and
travel codes.. Not even the Sword Worlds or the Zhodani Consulate itself
rates this kind of attention.  (There are seven Navy bases in Five Sisters,
compared to *two* in Jewell, and Jewell faces a far more obvious threat.

Oh shit indeed!  

Perhaps the Mad Arab wandered into a Hiver *archelogy* team excavating an
Ancient site on the Arabian pennisula.. If he was exposed to some sort of
telepathic "logbook", his mind would have been filled with unfathomable
images of monsters doing inexplicable things, and over all of them, the
image of one great god, immortal and utterly alien. The Hivers might have
explained (somehow, that the "god" in the images was gone, and Abdul mistook
that for sleeping.  Add in his SAN loss (oops, jumped systems for a sec)
*ahem*, trauma from being examined by Hivers, and you\'ve got one bestseller!

He might have even had his inate psionic potential kicked into overdrive,
making him believe he could work magic...

Grandfather isn\'t a major player anymore.. IMTU (In My Traveller Universe)
Virus was a Mule.. a singular event that caught the shadow organizations by
surprise.  Note however that the Domain of Deneb, including the Darrians,
Sword Worlds, and Five Sisters subsector survived almost intact.

>Were they able to stop his network across known space? 

Since Grandfather\'s network is either TL25+ or telepathic in nature, I doubt
that the Hivers are even aware that it exists.  As Craig suggested, the
Psionic supressions may have been a Templar action to keep the mass of
humanity from being able to access the Network.

Which make you wonder.. have the Zhodani accesses the Net, and could that be
the cause of the social breakdown we\'re seeing in the early 1200s?

The are a shadowy force, moving behind the scenes, directing things to their
own ends.  An Illuminati, if you will.

IMTU, the Templars have been working since the dawn of Solomani spaceflight
to unravel the secrets of the Ancients, and later, to protect mankind from
what they\'ve discovered.

>Based on their history, how would the resident voice (Craig;))for the

Don\'t trust Craig.. he\'s one of *them*, I\'m one of *us*  :)

The existence of the Templars should be considered a myth, on par with the
belief that Hitler is alive and well in the secret Nazi base in Antartica.
Only considerable digging will reveal that something is going on.

The Templars won\'t blow up a Starship to silence someone, they\'ll drive him
crazy, methodically destroy his life, and do it all in the absolute belief
that they are right.

The short lived UPN series "Nowhere Man" had a good plot for this.. A
photographer takes a picture he shouldn\'t have, and overnight his life
disappers.

Do we have any evidence that psionics are linked to genetics in any way?  I don\'t think 
so -- especially in light of 8,000 years of Zhodani culture, in which testing for 
psionics can be an entree into the ruling class for proles.

I think that these are regions reserved (for now) for referee development.  So if you 
want "boldly to go where no sophonts from known space have gone before" (precise writing 
is often not grand, I\'m afraid), you have to (or get to) create it yourself.  

The Zhodani have gone extremely far toward the core in their somewhat famous Core 
Expeditions.

A mind is a terrible thing to waste.  The unfortunate Mr. Berry has obviously joined the 
ranks of occult investigators who have gone insane.  His paranoia can be charted ahead 
with some precision.  Soon he\'ll be seeing perverse geometries in Keith Brothers\' art, 
drawing allusions between obscure Contact! races and obscure Mythos minions, and 
accusing me of being a pawn, or worse, of the unholy Elder Gods.  Sigh.

He has good company in his madness, to be sure, but still, we\'ll miss his presence on 
the TML.  He often had good things to say.  We\'ll still see postings with his signature, 
of course, but we all know that they won\'t be from him.  They\'ll be from whatever his 
cracked mind has become.  He may even be lucid from time to time.  Who knows.

In a word: yes.

The latest edition of Traveller does not change the familiar Traveller 
universe, although it will eventually look at it in many different eras 
(in the series of Milieu books that are planned). The alien races still 
exist, although we will learn of new ones (we\'ve already learned of some 
through _Alien\'s Archive_).  

Imperium Games currently plans to release a series of Alien Hardbound 
Volumes. At this point, each is planned to include two or three major 
races, and between two and four minor races. The first one is planned for 
release in August, and will provide a great deal of detail about Aslan 
and Vargr. Not only will the familiar material be included, it will also 
provide typical Aslan and Vargr cities, special equipment used by those 
races, and so on. The minor races to be included haven\'t been revealed at 
this time.


> What is to become of the Solomani Rim Campaign?

Once we return to the period in which that occurred, there may be a 
supplement on it.  But that\'ll be quite a while from now. :)  1997 is 
dedicated to Milieu 0 support material (as well as efforts to undo the 
errors of the first releases in the T4 line). 1998 will probably 
concentrate on Milieu 200.  Beyond that, we\'re getting too far in the 
future for anything more than theoretical discussion. =)

Hmmm, would\'nt the term \'interstellar\' include the Colonies earth had
within the Sol system?

Maybe not, i dont have a dictionary handy. 

Also, technically, this is correct, the Terrans meet the Vilani on there
first jump, but they meet Vilani Miners, no official contact.  Official
contact occured sometime after this first jump and the first interstellar
war.

Between first contact and the first intersteller war the Solomani had
estabblished (and claimed) Barnarb and the Cenaturi twins (A and B), as
well as 6 outpost worlds.  Im bassing this assertion on the game
\'Imperium\' which begins during the 2nd intersteller war, The confederation
had three Home World systems (not including Terra) and 6 outpost worlds.

But im just playing with words:)

True, but the Darrians Alien Module includes an adventure in which the
Darrians are able to figure out what really happened and, thereby, be
able to recreate the effect. Ergo, the Darrians really *do* have a
working solar flare inducer.

It\'s things like these that make me soooooo happy to own a copy of every
single traveller book produced (well, almost every one - I exclude T4 from my
list since I don\'t buy anything (sorry Mark, this has nothing to do with you
and everything to do with the cost of the books).

The Darrians book (the only minor race to have its own book)was one of the best
(I didn\'t care too much for the pointed ears though.  I liked the Hiver book
very much 
also and the Solomani book next (our descendants are assholes...:-)).

>peacefull, is this manipulation psionic?

Absolutely not. Hivers have no psionic talent whatsoever. A Hiver would 
be absolutely appaled  at your suggestion. Psionics is far too crude and 
obvious to be used as the stimulus to a manipulation.

What follows is a brief quote from the Alien Module 7: Hivers (CT)

"Manipulation is a uniquely Hiver phenomenon. It is an accepted activity 
which accords the successful manipulator respect and admiration from the 
population in general. It is a way for individuals to achieve a lasting 
sort of fame in their society.

Manipulation is rigidly defined by the Hivers to include four components: 
the deed, the manipulator, the consequences, and the claim of credit. 
Each component has been carefully refined and defined, and its 
requirements must be carefully met for it to be accepted."

Here\'s a brief synopsis of the four components of a successful 
manipulation:

1. Deed: Stimulus that sets the manipulation into motion. The stimulus 
must be premeditated by the manipulator, and carefully recorded. The 
Hiver is awarded "bonus points" for finesse if the deed is judged small 
and innocuous.

2. Manipulator: Hiver who performs the deed. That person may be open and 
direct, or work behind the scenes. In all cases, a true manipulation 
calls for the manipulator to be working alone and totally responsible for 
the act.

3. Consequences: Results of the initial act. There are obvious results to 
any Deed, and the evaluation of any manipulation ignores them. The 
unobvious effects are the true effects of a manipulation. The manipulator 
must predict them correctly.

4. Claim of credit: The manipulator must reveal the manipulation and 
present its evidence of responsibility and prediction of the 
consequences. Upon evaluation, the event is acknowledged as a 
manipulation (or not) and proper records are made.

Acknowledged manipulators are accorded a courtesy title of Manipulator 
(abbreviated M.) in respect for their deeds.

Yes. No hit location. But critical damage calculation tables, etc... It
is in the middle of a CT/MT -> T4 conversion. The reason for the post
was to see if anyone was interested in the system. If the response was
too low, I was going to just keep the old system for my use and not
bother with T4.

> Are those rules usable with TNE starships?
I am sure they can be. Let me explain. During the time that I played
Traveller I used ships from all games. Traveller, MT, StarTrek,
Battlestar G., Starwars. I would convert the ships into a base set of
values: Metric Tons, Armor Class, Drives, Jump Cap, Weapon Factors,
Crew, Boats, etc... Then I would plug these numbers into a spreadsheet
and Presto, I had a Ship Layout for my game. I would do a little
research as to the size, tonnage, crew, weapons, etc. and if I did not
have "real" numbers, I would make them up based on what I guessed the
capabilities were. I could then use this ship, and any deck plans,
without trouble. Nothing like seeing several old Cylon (SP?) ships face
off with several Star Destroyers and the PC in a Viper trying to explain
to Darth just who these guys chasing him were. Yes, It sounds a little
space opera now, but at the time (early 80\'s), what fun! 

> Are the damage points to the hull applied after penetration of armor?
No, Armor adds hull points as a percentage. example: If Armor is 20%
over average, then the ship gets 20% more hull hits. Simple.

No problem, I may stick with MT with some CT stuff and LOTS of house
rules. The best reason for staying with Traveller is the depth of
history and information available. Otherwise, I think the rules have
suffered, IMHO.

One of the best campaigns I ran involved a Powerful Warlord in the
Beyond who had spies running around kidnapping people (along with other
apparently evil stuff). =20

The PC\'s had a couple of encounters with some of his minions, but did
not have a clue what this guy was up to, nor did they really care. Live
and let live they figured. They only got involved when some of their
NPC\'s turned up missing. They tracked them down to this guy, so they
tried to kill him. But he was way too powerful. They escaped, but only
after losing two more PC\'s in the fighting (and a bunch of NPC=92s: of th=

40 people who went in, only two got away, and they were to warn=20
everyone else to stay away!). They still did not have a clue what this
guy was doing, only that he kidnapped people throughout the Beyond,
would strip their skills, then use those skills to program his clone
warriors for some supposedly evil purpose, leaving behind nothing but a
useless body.

The PC\'s were pissed! (and a little wigged out!) So they hired on some
more PC\'s (for the two players who were finding out just how much fun it
is to role-play a vegetable), and got together with an army of Mercs and
went after this guy. After fighting down to the strong hold, and
confronting the evil warlord, they asked him; "WHY?! Why are you doing
this?"=20

His answer;
"Fools, you are about to destroy everyone! If you kill me, you will
release this onto the universe!" and he revealed a portal onto another
planet with evil incarnate swarming toward them. Only the steady stream
of Clone Warriors were keeping the race at bay.=20

After awhile the Skills in the clone machine would have to be
replenished with some "Fresh" skills. The only place to get them was to
steal them. From living bodies.

That stopped the PC\'s in their tracks. What was the more evil: Leaving
this guy to strip friends and families minds, or this horrible unknown
race on the other side of the portal. You could hear the wheels
grinding.

I\'ve one word for you EMULATION!  I don\'t know about the PC, but there is
an Atari ST emulater for the Macintosh available at
http://www.emulation.net/ the bad news is it\'s a demo with a 15 minute
timer.  The good news is even on a lot of 68k Macs it\'s supposed to be
faster than the real thing.

So where can the atlas viewer be found?

In my CT campaign, this was the ultimate punishment, and occurred only 
on Hi-Law, Hi-Tech worlds.  The players were _usually_ very careful 
on these worlds.  

I did have one new PC who opened up with an auto-pistol in public on 
one of these worlds.  He got off lightly.  The party hired a local 
lawyer who managed to have the sentence reduced to mental 
conditioning.  The marine was conditioned so that the thought of 
physical violence made him physically ill.  The conditioning could be 
removed at any Higher-Tech, Hi-Pop world, but the player just 
couldn\'t deal with it long enough to get to one.

no restrictions on any further careers, military or otherwise. Why would an
injured character be discharged anyway? I know people who have been badly
injured and they didn\'t get fired immediately. Injuries which would result
in amputation a century ago can now be handled with antibiotics, and I
would assume medicine as higher TLs would be even more effective. Yet there
is no injury DM for tech level. The entire rule is vague and
military-oriented.

However, I like the game effect the roll has; characters can involuntarily
change careers mid-way through a term. The way I handle this is to simply
rename the "Injury" roll the "Unemployment" roll; it means that for some
reason the character was dismissed from his or her career prematurely; the
player has to come up with the reason. Possibilities include injury,
layoffs, incompetence, personality conflicts, bankruptcy, moving to another
planet, a criminal conviction, insubordination, a corporate buyout, even
religious conversion. The rules are the same, but this method lets the
player help create the character\'s background and provides some more plot
threads.

   Given how notoriously underfunded the British military is, I\'m sure
the fine was imposed not so much to save the lives of animals as it was
to save ammunition.

   At least we know a flank is not just a cut of meat.  :-)

   In general in the US Army, you can get in *big* trouble for
continuing to discharge your weapon after the signal is given to cease
fire.  I say in general, because the punishment inflicted upon any one
soldier or unit will vary depending upon the circumstances and the mood
of the range control officer.  No weapon should ever be considered
incapable of accidentally discharging, which is why you keep them
pointed *down range* at a range in the first place.

Well, that\'s what they _want_ you to think.

Either a) they theatrically produced another inert device (filled with old
pinball parts, probably) and dumped it into a star they knew was about to
flare anyway, or...

b) It wasn\'t a weapon, nor was it was a simple recording device.  It did
not malfunction.  The "meson communicator" may have been a form of exhaust
or a navigational stabilizer; in any event there is fragmentary but strong
evidence that the liquid tungsten was merely a jacket that shielded a
short-lived unstable reactor that generated far too many mesons and
tachyons, among other exotic particles.  The intent was to get the device
as deep as possible into a star so that when the shielding failed, the
escaping reaction would cause the star to flare, or better, go nova.  This,
as I\'m sure you see clearly now, could only have been a signal, or a
beacon, to some unthinkably ancient malefic beings searching for upstart
sentients with just the right technology level.  Fnord.

Nope.  It was really part of the Phoenix Project.  But that\'s another

No chance.  The net is psionic, and that\'s a major weak spot for the

Based both on the historical Templars, and on the way a big conspiracy has
to operate, I\'d lay odds that there\'s a visible, accessible front
organization...call it the "Knights of the Temple of Light," nice
innocuous name, or whatever...that has a public, well-defined mission --
guarding the spaceways, protecting minor races, heck, running youth soccer
teams and charity hospitals.  Like, oh, say, just f\'rinstance, the Octagon
Society, to pull in a name at random.

Membership may be severely restricted (by social rank, or recommendation
requirements, or whatnot), and is considered highly prestigious -- like
the Masons about 50 years ago.  Most members stop there, using the
organization as a business club and social arena.  They go through some
initiations, learn some secret words, get some good solid spiritual
advice, and there it stops.

All of this is merely a veil for the *real* Templars -- who will all deny
to their last breath that such an organization exists, much less that they
are members -- chosen carefully from the ranks of the outer order for
further initiation and training, based on the needs of the inner order and
the merits of each individual.  Part of this level of involvement is
acceptance of death as the penalty for betraying the order, and the
Templars have historically been ruthlessly efficient at carrying this out. 

As has been suggested, the Templars -- the *real* Templars -- will always
operate in secret, eschewing direct confrontation unless there are no
witnesses.  If a ship needs to be eliminated, it won\'t be confronted by a
Templar cruiser with lasers blazing -- instead, a mechanic a starport
somehow forgets to realign the jump grid stabilizer properly, and the ship
disappears forever on its next jump.

The innermost circle of the Templars -- perhaps a few hundred sophonts
throughout the Imperium -- are all psionics, trained to previously
unsuspected heights of acuity and power.  A few of these can (unreliably,
at great cost in pain and short-term sanity) tap into Grandfather\'s
communication grid and send messages instantly across the parsecs. 

Preliminary contact has been made via this channel with a group of Zhodani
researchers investigating the same phenomenon.  Note that this contact
preceded physical meeting with the Zhodani, and helped influence the
expansion and commercial patterns of the growing Empire -- though whether
Cleon himself was directly informed or not remains a mystery.

The Templars are not strong in numbers or resources, but rather in
information and influence.  These latter are often far more dangerous than
the former two.

That good enough for y\'all? :)

And of course neither of them can kick up *too* much of a fuss without
tipping their hands.

You know, the more I think about it, the more Five Sisters looks like a
big magnet, pulling in every culture in this part of the galaxy.  A bunch
of Solomani went *way* out of their way to colonize next door, when their
must have been a gazillion worlds closer to home; the Darrians grew up
next door, and of course rocketed up the TLs until that tragic \'accident\'; 
the 3I and Zhos pushed for the Marches as fast as they could get there; 
hell, a bunch of Solomani got within a few dozen parsecs using *slower
than light travel from Earth!* (see the Islands Cluster).  Then Aslan
ihatei start spilling into this very region from rimward, despite the
difficulties of crossing the Great Rift.  What *is* it about the
rim-wpinward corner of the Marches that makes everyone want to go there,
hmmmm?

And I\'d lay odds on a covert military presence on most of the other worlds

I am in awe.  This is all starting to fit.  Anybody recall what Grandpa

Yeah, not Grandpa\'s fault, but our Friends of Yadroskay do pretty well by
themselves in keeping Virus away.  One wonders if Granddad didn\'t do a
little covert vampire removal work to help out, before the Regency got its
defenses in order.

That part is looking more and more solid to me.  The interesting question
now is whether they did it at Grandfather\'s behest (knowingly or
unknowingly) or simply to reserve it for themselves.

Absolutely, positively.  And (as I mentioned in another post), the
Templars have been in direct zero-transit-time contact with Zhodani psi
researchers since around year 0 -- so the Templars find out about the
whole Empress Wave mess before *anyone* else in the 3I does.

Yes, the existence of the \'inner order\' will be like this.  Equivalent to
the "Freemasons run the world" line of conspiracy theories; everyone knows
the Masons *exist*, just most people view them as balding businessmen who
occasionally wear funny hats, rather than an elite force of secret
masters.  My view of the Templars has secret masters hiding behind the
balding sophonts in funny hats. :)

Actually, the fact that your name is Eris was a coincidence.
I was referring to the Illuminatus greeting in reference to the Fnord in
the header.
Is that synchronocity or what?

Begin Paranoid Mode

Oh sure The Darrians Module says that The Star Trigger was not a weapon
but do you _believe_ this story ? Obviously the pro Darrian writers were
just trying to portray these evil being in a favorable light for a
mostly Solomani audience.  The Darrians were obviously trying to achieve
just what they got, a star trigger. They clearly intended to use this
ultimate weapon as a part of their ethnic cleansing project to rid the
universe of other races.  At the time they developed the Star Trigger
they did not even _have_ any neighbors but they knew, from the Solomani
colonists, that other humans were out there & they were determined to be
able to wipe them out.  Naturally even in their most secret documents
(on which the Alien Module was based) they perpetuated the fiction that
the Maghriz was the fluke result of two unrelated programs and not the
fault of over zealous members of the military industrial complex.

     We need to be aware of the vast danger that threatens us in the form of
Darrian infiltrators plotting to destroy our culture from within.  We
must exterminate the race before it is too late.  As a further proof of
the Darrians evil I would like to point out that Darrians never have to
diet or watch their weight, their metabolisms just burn off the extra
calories (and where do these calories go, I ask you, but towards
powering their plot against us).

     Did you ever wonder _why_ The Darrians are the only minor race to get
their own Alien Module - obviously the brave and heroic Marc Miller as
part of his program to save the universe for its true heirs caused the
document to be published to warn us about the extent of the Darrian
plot.  Even someone so wise & powerfull as Marc hesitated to go up
against The Darrian Plot so the clues to the Darrians evil are cleverly
hidden throughout the module but a carefull reading of its text will
reveal the plot to you.

Too small to see. Seriously!

The rules swiped the idea from proposals for a emergency escape system
from the Shuttle/Space Station.

If you\'ve ever seen a full size mockup of a Mercury capsule, you\'d know
that you don\'t "get into" it, as much as you *wear* the silly thing.
And with the advances in both knowledge and materials we could do better.

The real problems are keeping acceleration low, keeping the RV from
tumbling, and the ability to choose a landing point.

The Regency Sourcebook says (pg 48) "The subsector had not been heavily
settled throughout the pr-Collapse era. Serious colonization only began
in 740, but was cut short with the start of the Psionic Suppressions in
800 [ ! ! ! ], and the frontier wars made it clear that major Imperial
development would not be practical in this area.....in the new friendly
climate between the Zhodani and Domain/Regency, development and
migration long-postponed began in earnest in the 1130\'s..." 

     Why did the frontier wars make it clear ? Does this sentance just have
its apparent surface meaning that the Imperium did not have the
resources to develop this area and fight the Zhodani at the same time ? 
Was this all part of the Zhodhani (who have a precognative Ancients
Artifact don\'t forget) plans from the beginning ? Was it really a
coincidence that Olav hault_Plankwell who, as Grand Admiral of the
Marches, defeated the Out-World Coalition in the First Frontier War
later went on to become the first of the Emporers of the Flag ?  If
_that_ was a coincidence how can we explain Arbatrella who, as Grand
Admiral of the Marches, defeated the Out-World Coalition in the Second
Frontier War later went on to become the last Emporer of the Flag and
the first of the reigning Alkhalikoi dynasty ?  Did the Zhodani loose
the Frontier wars on purpose to help make these people into heros as
part of their psychohistorical manipulation of the Third Imperium ? 

     Was the failure of the secret Imperial psychohistory project that
attempted to turn public opinion against psionics and failed when it
worked _too_ well really a failure, or was it part of a SORAG plot ? Was
stopping development of this area part of the secret Zhodani peace
conference agendas during the Frontier Wars ? Is it really a coincidence
that Archduke of the Domain of Deneb Norris Aella Aledon had a psionic
\'seneschal\' (I believe the phrase I\'m really looking for is longtime
companion) ? Was it really a coincidence that Norris\'s father & brother
died so close to the same time under mysterious circumstances ?  What is
the significance of Norris\'s background in Naval Intelligence ? Was
Norris a Templar ?  How did Norris know to seal off the Domain from the
Virus ?

The answers to these and other exciting questions can be yours next week
on As The Imperium Turns.

Yes but obviously 69 million TL 8 and 9 Droyne are 4 times the threat
that trillions of TL 14 Zhodhani are. :)

But you are assuming that the Vilani met the Geonee and the Solomani at
roughly about the same time.  You should look at Carlos\' timeline on my
site.  If I remember from that and Carlos\' recent article, the Vilani
meet the Geonee around -8700 Imperial or thereabout.  At that time, the
Solomani haven\'t even invented writing to record history yet (although I
could be wrong).  I don\'t think we even had civilization yet.  By the
time the Geonee are incorporated in the Ziru Sirka forcibly and the
Vilani stop expansion, Terrans have barely discovered civilization.  By
the time the Terrans visit Barnard\'s Star in the late 21st century Terran
(in the  -2600s Imperial, if I remember correctly.  I don\'t have my books
onhand), The Geonee have been members of the Ziru Sirka for almost 2000
years.

So the term interstellar WOULD include Terra and the colonies, but not
for almost 7 millenia after the first meeting of the Geonee and the
Vilani.

Carlos, please correct me if I\'m wrong.

BTW, you can see Carlos\' timeline in the Geonee Online Sourcebook at

    'body' => 'Dear Nicolas,

The term you are looking for is "specific heat capacity", I believe,
which is defined either at constant volume or constant pressure.
Since you\'re an engineer, you might recognise it as C_p or C_V,
i.e. dH/dT at constant pressure p or dU/dT at constant volume V.

It can be shown that for an ideal gas, C_V = 3/2 R and C_p = C_V + R, 
so C_p = 5/2 R.  Here R is the gas constant; R = 8.314 kJ /mol /K
These are *molar* heat capacities; 1 mol of an ideal gas takes up 
22.4 litres at 273K and 24 litres at 298K, both for 1 atmosphere 
pressure. (Molar volume of ideal gas V_m = RT/p.)

Given an appropriate relative molar mass, we can calculate C.
M_r for H2 is 2 g /mol (OK, 2.016 or so), and for air roughly 29 g 
/mol.

H2: C_p = 5/2 * 8.314 J /mol /K  * (1 / 2 g /mol)
        = 10 J /g /K
    C_V = 6 J /g /K

Air: C_p = 0.67 J /g /K
    C_V = 0.4 J /g /K

These are not dissimilar to Rob Flammang\'s values (which are probably 
measurements, and correct) so the method is OK, and generalises.

Please note that in H2 gas below 80K and (I\'m morally certain) in 
liquid H2 as well, there are quantum effects which reduce the heat 
capacity below the expected value. (It\'s to do with ortho and para 
hydrogen not interconverting very quickly, since you ask.)

What, not even if it\'s been recording the amount of energy per hit? 
If the cutoff is set to the highest energy received so far, or an 
(educated) estimate of the most energetic hit possible, then surely 
that would save some globe failures. And it could be over-ridden, 
of course.

Alkali metals have very low heat capacities, and so will cool after 
only a few collisions, forming small clusters of metal. Mind you, 
they\'re quite shiny (in vacuum) so they won\'t radiate heat quickly,
and might last long enough to splatter-plate BD. My guess is that at 
thermal energies almost every collision will lead to a cluster.

Hmm. I suspect that even at very low temperatures you\'d get a lot of 
electron transfer from Na to F, weakening the surface layers of C-F 
bonds, and then some reaction with the subsurface. You could get a 
nice layer of sodium fluoride insulator over your suit.

Not sure how practical repressurising with water vapour is, in terms 
of ship\'s lifesupport systems. Your main problem is the H2 gas, which 
gets everywhere. Adding N2 will prevent explosive mixing of air and 
H2 (well, maybe... you might want to try and vent the lot) but the H2 
will get everywhere -- into the walls of the room, etc.. 250g of Na 
would provide 130-odd litres of H2 gas, which is not a lot but hardly 
trivial.

work tomorrow, I figured I\'d better do the weekend update now.  I\'ve been

little) research and cam up with a guideline.  Remember this is JUST A
GUIDELINE!!

1.  All prices are considered to include postage to the continental USA.

     MORE INFO ON POSTAGE:
          US POSTAGE:  Parcel Post will be used for all shipping of one item.
                       Priority Mail will be used for more than 1 item.
                       For Priority Mail for single item orders, add $1.00.
                       For Express Mail (Second Day to Post Office) add $10.00.
          CANADA:  Canada postage is Standard Letter Rate (Add $1.00 per item)
          OTHER:  Postage is not included and will be approximately
                   $5.00 for the first item and $2.00 per item after the first.

For more than 5 items, postage will be figured more precisely.
Other postage options will be considered and possibly used at the bidders
decision.


Any item that received more than one bid for the same amount, I put all
bidders at the highest amount down.  Please check and see that you bid is
right, and if you haven\'t bid yet, check to see what you need to fill out
your collection.  Also, I will be sending responses to everyone who places a

missions? And how small could such a vehicle be? >>

Let a frmr "Conehead" help you.  The Mark 12 re-entry vehicle
of the Minuteman III ICBM is roughly "man-sized", able
to perform minor inertial guidance manuvers and weighs
about a tonne with its telemetry.  The ablative material
is a combination of foam and teflon.  The Mark 5
re-entry vehicle for the Titan missile was about five
times the size of the Mark 12.  The abaltive foam
system you speak of, was described in the early sixties
predating the Apollo program and was not truly instituted
TTBOMK.  I\'ve used "systems" akin to the Mark 12/Mark 5 in
describing "drop capsules" for my Shipboard Marines.  They
weigh close to 2 tonnes.

Just a freindly reminder that the Imperial Online University will be having 
Sociology 101 (aka SOC-ONE) tonight at 8:30pm EST.  Your Professor this 
evening is none other than Count Commander Prof. Emeritus. \'X\'

Although the Commanders main expertise is in Shipbuilding and Engineering, 
he has agreed under the request of Z. Roze Cardell (Suz Dollar) to do a 
discussion of sociology.

The Commander has only a basic outline, based mainly on the last 4 digits of 
the IISS UPP plus the starport type:

Population
Government
Law Level
Technology Level
Starport type will be also factored in as an indication of outworld trade 
and contact.

There will be some examples of \'how would you interpret "X" society with 
this UPP.  Here are 3 examples I will use to start you thinking.

I\'ve always assumed so; surely the Zhodani don\'t want the 
largest interstellar empire around to be developing anything 
that would remove the Zhodani\'s only edge.

>Was stopping development of this area part of the secret Zhodani peace
>conference agendas during the Frontier Wars ? 

Most likely -- I hadn\'t considered this angle before, but it 
makes sense.  Isn\'t there a psionics institute on Wypoc or 
Yori or somewhere near the border?  Hmmm.

>Is it really a coincidence that Archduke of the Domain of Deneb Norris

The psionic seneschal angle arises in Survival Margin; it\'s an 
interesting developement.  He was probably a Zhodani 
political officer assigned to maintain Norris\' stability.  
The seneschal is somewhat analogous to the mentat from Dune (and doesn\'t 
have any connotations of longtime companionship).  He serves 
as an information filter, digesting the huge volumes of information 
that come to the ducal office and presenting it in useable form 
to the Duke.

It varies from weapon to weapon, but from the FN FAL it is 823 m/s.

As a point of reference, a 5.56x45mm fired from a M16A1 has a muzzle
velocity of 1000 m/s.

That would be "interplanetary."  Interstellar means "between the stars."

Contact is contact.  That UN crew must have had a series of shocks.. first
the meet aliens, then the aliens turn out to be human, then they find out
how large the Zir Sirka is!

ISTR they were originally going to be insects. Marc?

They can be affected (maybe not tp).

We\'ve been assuming the existence of a known space spanning telepathic
"net", yes?  Perhaps the broadcast machine is on Andor or Candory.  Perhaps
the emissions cause a subtle attraction in sentient races.  It might even be
behind the desire to go to the stars!

We could just be moths, flying towards the Ancients flame.  This is why the
Templars have tried to supress the open use of psionics, they know we\'ll get
burned (more about this below.)

Well, there is Research Station Zeta on Froin/Five Sisters (0539); it\'s only
Jump 4 from the two Droyne worlds.

Or maybe the Templars gave Norris\' seneschal/long time companion an advance
warning over the network?  Being the aide and lover of a powerful Duke,
later Archduke would be just the thing that the Templars would aspire to,
especially in the Spinward Marches.

As I think about the Psionic Supressions/Zhodani reluctance to advance
closer to the Droyne worlds/Network; I\'ve come to believe that the Network
is an iherently dangerous thing.  Hook up 100 human telepaths, and 99 of
them will die screaming, while the other will spend the rest of days
screaming at the walls.  1 in a 1000 may be able to use it, but that
individual will get *weird*.

My reason for this belief is that the Network was designed for the 421
super-intellegent ancients (Grandfather and the kids and grandkids.)  The
human (or Vargr or Aslan) brain isn\'t capable of handling the overload of
information, or the alien thought processes that it\'s carried in.  I\'d
imagine that even modern Droyne would have difficulty using the net.

I imagine a there is no "psionic gene" just as there is no gene for long
legs. Perhaps a group of recessives or a rare dominant. (I believe that I
read that the genes for six fingers is a dominant, just rare.)  So a test for
psionics would be a test for expressed genes, not just the prescence of the
gene.

Arrival Vengeance doesn\'t really go into a lot of detail about above.
However, it would be a good scenario for the troupe play from Ars Magica
that someone mentioned a while ago. It is an adventure tinged with sadness
and regret, preceding the final death blow to the 3I. However, the Regency
Sourcebook does supply much of what you are looking for- Longbow is a very
sophisticated  observation system (IIRC, it also involved psionics, or was
that Longbow II?). Between AV, the Regency Sourcebook and MT you can get
most of the details.

Hi,

For the past few weeks, I\'d being having trouble sending 
to the TML, and decided to, last week, unsubscribe and then 
resubscribe to see if that would correct the problem.

Now,  when I try to resusbscirbe, I can\'t get on.  If 
soemone could help me, I\'d appreciate it.  I\'ve been on 
the list for about a year, and am an irregular poster, 
and I want to get on.

I\'ve tried e-mail Rob Miracle, but he never replied.

Thanks,

In the Zhodani module they have a system for running characters thru an
area that hasn\'t been mapped yet (the idea being that they\'ve stolen a
ship in Zhodani space and they are trying to get home). And the thing
is, it\'s randomly placing stars in such a way that it\'s clear that you
can detect stars AND GAS GIANTS at 3 parsecs. The gas giant detection
isn\'t perfect, but but the star detection is ok.

Funny you should ask. I just dug out the alien modules for something
else. 

- -4698 Imperial is the date of the first jump to another system. But
*supposedly* this was a drive that melted down after about 10 uses.
They got the standard Jump-1 drive in -4212. So say the histories...

Well, while I know that you are talking about Galanglic grammar, I just
*have* to point out that "Terra" being *Latin*, you use Latin
grammatical rules. This "sort of" gives Terran. I say "sort of" because
if you go by Latin rules for *naming*, the pair should be "Tellus" and

Oh yeah, "Sol" gives "Solarian".

Like I told Bruce, I have to spread the agony around. I walked in one
day, and spotted a *first edition* of The Hunt for Red October (the
Naval Institute Press edition!) and I couldn\'t afford it. And of
course, it was gone by the time I had money... Wah!

At 5000 m/s, it *won\'t* "drill holes". The dart will *explode* on
impact, with an energy equal to 2.7 times its weight in TNT. 

Admittedly, that\'s the *high* end for what I\'d consider. There are
varmint rifles with 5000 *feet* per second muzzle velocities. Hit a
crow with a 22 bullet and it turns into a cloud of feathers. A
watermelon becomes several large chunks and a lot of
"watermelon-sauce".

No, that\'s more in the varmint gun range.

A "coil gun" could do that, but it\'d make a complicated weapon even
more complex. A rail gun *could* but you\'d have to have a way to either
change the strength of the magnetic field (not likely for a rifle) or
be able to limit the current (not easy at the level involved).

No, no, that\'s *far* too obscure. You need a group with branches at
most starports, a *strong* news gathering arm (actually a cover for
intel ops), and lots of members who roam around with the organization
supplying funds every so often. And some banking facilities in most
branches as well as a rep for helping people who have been "stranded"
or "wrongly" accused of things by the locals. Of course, 99% of the
group is "cover" for the secret goings on.

Only group like *that* is the Traveller\'s Aid Society....

Again, Traveller\'s Aid Society (which is a lot like the old "Explorer\'s
Club" was, with added traces of the local American Express office or
American/British Embassy) fits the bill very nicely.

So? In a vacuum, the thermal energy is mostly tied up in moving in a
straight line. Once out of the grenade, the *first* collision is likely
to be a wall or the BD. And the low heat capacity means that once it
hits, it\'ll stay. 

Think of it as speeded up "vapor deposition". It takes *very* little to
plate things in a vacuum.

Shouldn\'t be too hard. Carry a bucket of water into the sealed off
section, and take off the lid. It\'ll boil dry *fast*. Repeat until you
reach a few psi.

Ship\'s using LH2 fuel *have* to have *good* scrubbers for getting H2
out of the air. Otherwise the first fuel leak would be a disaster. 

Hmmm. It just occured to me that you could use a small fusion pack to
salt into Sodium and Chlorine plasma. The chlorine gets cooled into a
gas, (and used later to react with the H2). The sodium plasma gets
sprayed at the attackers.

Assumtions:
The difficulty in hitting a ship with a laser is not due to random spread of
beams while firing but rather timelag from when you get the sensordata and the
time the beam/pulse arrives. This means that if a ship is accelerating straight
with no variance in accleration value nor direction a shot always hits as long
as it is within sensor resolving range. This means that what a ship defends
with is it\'s evasive acceleration and in order for such maneuvering to be
effective it has to accelerate a distance at least as long as the ships radius.
(Note that all (I hope) equations follow mathematical operator precedence to
avoid unneccessary parentheses)

The formula for accelerated distance is:
(1) s = at^2/2
a = acceleration in m/s^2, 1G = 9.81 m/s^2

The timelag for sensor/beamtravel is target to sensor and back again with
lightspeed. We need to make two measurements to get a velocity value and three
for acceleration value of the target. Assume we need to know the location,
velocity and acceleration of the target, this gives us:
(2) t = 6R/c where
R = range to target, c = 3E8 m/s (slightly less actually, I know)

The distance the target needs to accelerate to be effective is about a ships
radius which if assuming the ship is a cube is aproximately:
(3) r = v^(1/3)/2
v = ships volume in m^3

Now, plug (2) into (1) gives us:
(4) s = a(6R/c)^2/2 which becomes s = a18R^2/c^2

The range at which a certain shipsize with a certain evasion acceleration gets
effective we\'ll find by assuming (4) equals (3):
(5) v^(1/3)/2 = a18R^2/c^2

Shuffle the terms about to get R as a function of the other terms:
(6) R = (c^2*v^(1/3)/(36a))^(1/2) which looks better like:
(6) R = c(v^(1/3)/(36a))^(1/2)

Now, plug some numbers into (6) to see what we get. Assume a type S scout which
in your universe is 1400 m^3 and definately not a sphere but we leave that
aside for now. It evades with all its acceleration of 2G. This gives us:
c = 3E8, v = 1400, a = 2*9.81 and from (6) R = 37.8 thousand kilometers or
about one hex in space combat.

What does this tell us? That given the above assumtions a ship that fires on a
100 dTon ship that evades with 2G will be automatically hit if the range is
less than a hex. That\'s OK in the current system as most space combat will be
at 1 hex or more. How about an Azhanti High lightning?
According to Fighting Ships it is 60 000 dTons agility = 0(?) so we use 2G for
our calculations. This gives us:
c = 3E8, v = 840 000, a = 2*9.81 and R = 109.6 thousand kilometers or 3 hexes
or less. You cannot miss an Azhanti if it is within 3 hexes and evades at 2G.

I like these figures but you may not. We can handwave in the computer DM from
High Guard with this assumtion. The timelag calculation ignores the time
required to analyze sensordata in equation (2). If we assume a base time for
computation denoted p (for processing) and add this to (2)
(2b) t = p + 6R/c
Plug (2b) into (1) gives us:
(4b) s = a(p + 6R/c)^2/2 which becomes s = a(p^2+12pR/c+36R^2/c^2)
Equalling with (3) gives us
(5b) v^(1/3)/2 = a(p^2+12pR/c+36R^2/c^2)

What this leaves us is left as an exercise for the reader but basically it
works as the processing time adds a fixed range to the actual shooting range
R+ = pc/6 and for a 1 second processing time (too long to be realistic but
remember
that this is for handwaving purposes) R+ = 50 thousand kilometers or about 2
hexes. Note that processing is taking place while the 3 measurements to get
location, velocity and acceleration is done so I only add p once.

I\'ll be back with more on passive/active sensors, beam pointers et c.

Comments are welcome.

OK, I\'ll show my ignorance... how again is this explosion happening? 
A lexan dart with steel rails (and maybe a needle inside for AP) is 
going to *explode* when it contacts flesh? I would have thought it 
would punch through anything in its way, unless the target were hard 
enough to deflect it. I don\'t see why you postulate an explosion 
here...

Again, I guess I am not clear on the issues involved here. Why 
couldn\'t you just rig a potentiometer or some such to regulate the 
current being fed to the rails? It seems simple to me...

   I was assuming that the word came from Vilani, since it was coined by
   Hiroshi in an address to the empire, and it\'s analogous to "Zhodani"
   and "Vilani", which are obviously not anglic or latin constructions. 
   If it\'s Latin, then "Solomani" means "guys from Solomo/Soloma/Solom"
   (or "followers of Solomon").  Do these roots mean anything in Latin?

   It occurs to me that the name "Solomon" comes from a hebrew root
   meaning "peace".  This was one of my guesses as to the meaning of the
   root that originally produced "Solomani".  One might imagine, though,
   that this reference may have been a little obscure to Hiroshi\'s
   target audience.  (Although I\'m sure that a good conspiracist can find
   an imaginative connection! 8^)

Yes, MagicMac - IIRC a \'040 Mac runs up to 10-16 times faster! I\'ll try to
download it and try once I find the disk. You can get an emulator for the

I got it off the STClub, a UK PD library. Have to dig out the reference -
most things are packed away as I\'m about to move. They did have an address

On my hard disk? The author is David Burden - I don\'t have an email address 
for him, but he can probably be reached through BITS. My copy is (c) 1990, so 
there may be a more recent (maybe even Mac or PC) version. The whole thing is 
about a meg, but most of that is sector data so it should zip up smaller. If 
there\'s a demand, I\'ll stick it on my web page, but I\'m busy atm, so don\'t

I am new to the string but a long time traveller player.  I was wondering if
anyone has a High Guard for sale.  I lost mine several years ago and have not
been able to find one.

I don\'t know if I\'m the only one but I still think it is the definitive book
for ship building....especially bigger ships.  Does anyone still do the
Trillion Credit Squadron thing?

Marc\'s original notion was for them to be avian (to put it simply), but he
told me, John Harshman and Bill Keith to do whatever we wanted as long as
they were _not_ insect-like.

Yes!  A siren song, luring sophonts from afar...what a lovely image!  Does
anyone happen to know what\'s immediately to spinward and rim-spinward of
Darrian subsector, canonically speaking?  One would expect some
interesting things through there, if this theory really works.

My guess is that Grandfather\'s psi-net isn\'t much of a threat to
individuals, unless you try to force yourself onto it (which only the most
adept psions can even think of attempting).  Lesser psis who accidentally
operate \'near\' it get a strong queasy-repulsion reaction (without knowing
why) and do something different almost reflexively.  Paradoxically, the
broader and more important effect is to attract psi-capable races *toward*
Andor/Candory.  Douglas\'s moths-to-the-flame analogy is very apt.

My model exactly.  Most psions will be utterly incapable of mustering
either the psychic power or the willpower to \'connect\' enough to even get
hurt; a person able to really use the psinet will be a little weird to
start with, and get progressively more warped as time goes by.

I imagine that when the war between Grandpa and his clan erupted, control
of the psinet became an important object of battle.  One may imagine that
it\'s filled with the equivalent of \'mines\' to keep out unwelcome users.
These may well be tuned specifically to Droyne minds, since those were the
only hostiles at the time of the war; as a result, modern Droyne may be
*least capable* of all psionic sophonts of using the psinet.

I\'d like to see \'em in those little cars even more... :)

It\'s all been there, staring us in the face, from the beginning.  How Marc
must have laughed...membership in the ultimate secret society ruling all
of known space from behind the scenes is handed out on the friggin\'

And to make matters worse, my copy of Milleu Zero has walked out on me.
So, the real interesting stuff will have to wait (unless someone was
real nice and sent me the info, while I raise the capital to buy another
copy, sigh...)

So, here\'s the need info list:

CLASSIC TRAVELLER:
Adventure 13   Signal GK
Doub Adv 3     The Argon Gambit/Death Station
Alien Module 5 Droyne
Alien Module 8 Darrians (mostly page numbers - lots of ????)
Rules Set The Traveller Book/Starter Traveller
Game 4         Fifth Frontier War (esp. the TNS stuff, or was this reprinted in JTAS)
Game 5         Invasion Earth
Module 1  Tarsus (mostly page numbers - lots of ????)
Module 2  Beltstrike (mostly page numbers - lots of ????)
JTAS issues 1-5, 7, 9, 10 and 21 (BTW, send me TNS items as well...)

In addition, I need stuff from old TRAVELLER licensees - Judges Guild,
FASA, Group One, Marischal Adventures, Paranoia Press, and DGP (esp.
TD #5 and #18, which an old "friend" borrowed and then moved away)...

MEGATRAVELLER:
I need a list of products released by DGP and GDW - the only lists I\'ve been
able to find are largely "CT".

And, any other licensees who produced MegaTraveller stuff (all I know about
is Seeker\'s deck plans).

THE NEXT ERA:
I never bought anything in this area, so someone who is a real big TNE fan
could really help me out.  Also, Harold Hale, I\'ll be adding your "Children
of Earth" material here, thanks for that (I hadn\'t forgotten!).

MILLEU ZERO:
See above.  Why couldn\'t they walked off with Starships, which was sitting
right under it?

Actually, I suppose any Traveller Chronicle information would be useful.
Also, I\'m wanting to compile other fanzine material into this at some point...

Thanks for the help, and PLEASE respond.  Also, if you maintain a timeline
on the web, contact me, even if it\'s non-official.  I\'m going to start 
incorporating that material shortly...

In campaigns I\'ve played in, BD was a ceramic composite of a non-ferrous
nature. Magneticly placed mines wouldn\'t work in this case.  However, a
player in that campaign came up with the idea of an adhesive attached
explosive device.  Not very pratical as he wasn\'t able to get close
enough to attach the device.

As far as the power pack and such goes, these are protected.  So you
can\'t really take them out. Some sort of AP rounds were the preferred
methodology...

I\'m probably the only person in the world that would consider a good
bookstore (new or used) a tourist spot, but I\'d rather tour a bookstore
than a canyon any day.

So, where is "the biggest and best used bookstore in th world" located? And
does it have a web site?

1) Name
2) Publisher
3) Approximate price
4) Address, Both snail and electronic.

Thanks in advance,

A recent post asked about the ship design systems, what is being done, 
and so on and so forth.

1)  Marc Miller and Guy "Wildstar" Garnett are currently working on a 
revised QSDS, to be included in T4 Deluxe.  This will be the central ship 
design system for Traveller.

2)  Marc Miller is also working on a ship combat system, to be included 
in T4 Deluxe, that actually works and uses the ship features allowed 
under the QSDS. 

3)  After the new QSDS is finished, Marc, Guy, and David Golden will be 
crafting the "full-up" design system, Fire, Fusion, and Steel.  It will 
be fully compatible with, but much more flexible than, the new QSDS.

4)  As I mentioned a few times previously, the "Naval Archetect\'s Manual" 
listed on IG\'s site is NOT the same as the "Naval Archetect\'s Handbook" 
that was under discussion on GDW-Beta.  Naval Archetect\'s Manual will 
provide rules for designing deck plans, how starships operate, and 
all that good stuff.


And, just for the record, I\'ll state once again what the current design 
process is, and how it differs from the old (books 1-6) design process:

Old Design Process:  Designer(s) work from previously published materials 
to craft the book they\'re working on. It then goes into editing, 
typsetting, etc.

New Design Process:  Marc Miller comes up with an outline and general 
guidelines for what is to be included in the work.  Designer(s) work from 
that outline to create the tables to be used in the book.  Those tables 
are sent to Marc, who reviews them and requests any changes he feels are 
necessary.  The designers make those changes, then start writing the 
text.  As the text is completed, it is sent to Marc.  He may ask for 
additional changes, to ensure that everything conforms to his vision of 
Traveller.  Any final changes are made, then it goes into editing, 
typsetting, etc.

T4 is Marc Miller\'s Traveller.  He calls the shots.  It\'s not a bunch of 
people doing their own thing.  It\'s a team of game designers working

Oh, and one more thing: I can\'t say for sure why Emperor\'s Arsenal isn\'t 
on the web site anymore.  I can only guess it was supposed to have been 
moved from "future products" to "present products," but the web site 
maintainer only got half-way through that process.  But, again, I don\'t 
really know.  All I know is, if it was scuttled, then IG\'s out a lot of 
money since the books have, to the best of my knowledge, already been 
printed.

The subsectors immediately to spinward and rim spinward of the Darrian
subsector are Reidan (subsector L of Foreven) and Urnian (subsector P of
Foreven)  Imperial Lines #1 says (pg 2), in an article by Greg Videll
and Mark Mikesh,  "Marc Miller has officially set Foreven Sector aside
for MegaTraveller players and referees....The individual worlds and
systems of the sector have an official location within the MegaTraveller
universe but will not be named or have a UWP.  With only a few
exceptions...."

Reidan subsector contains 3 of the 5 worlds in the sector given UWP\'s

Hollis     2523  A370642-C A De Ni 303 Cs M3V

Hollis is a key Imperial client state within the region

Alenzar    3229  C000414-9   As Ni 513 Cs G0V
Raschev      3230  C8697C4-6       123 Cs M9V

for more details on these two worlds see Double Adventure 5 Charmax
Plague/Horde

Of the 22 worlds in Reidan subsector 4 are members of the Avalar
Consulate an ally of & client to the Zhodani Consulate

Urnian subsector contains 27 worlds none of which have detailed UWP\'s
provided , 3 worlds in the subsector are members of the Avalar
Consulate.

The Avalar Consulate, whose Capital is:
Avalar 1636 Foreven A75599C-C J Cp      904 Ac M0V
 occupies parts of subsectors J (Titan), K (Xenough), L (Reidan), M
(Harem), N (Piah) of Foreven.  Cannonically it continues rimward into
the Beyond Sector.  Unfortunately Parania Presses Beyond Sector does not
contain the Avalar Consulate and is therfore no longer canonical.  (I
still plan to use it anyway if players ever get that far as it is a good
product.) Intersetingly enough most of the Avalar Consulate is a fairly
narrow straight "up and down" (coreward/rimward) line but it has a
branch that reaches out to trailing towards the Spinward Marches.  This
branch is (surprise/surprise) at its closest to the Marches at 2829
(jump 5 from the sector border & jump 7 from the Darrian Confederation
(at Ektron)and at 2731 (jump 6 from the sector border & jump 6 from the
nearest imperial world Emape (which has a Naval base)  It looks to me as
if the Avalar Consulate is trying (no doubt on the secret orders of
their hidden masters, the Zhodani) to get as close as they dare to the
Five Sisters subsector but the Imperial Navy is not letting them.

As an interesting point for those of you whose conspiracies and signs
include numerology (total garbage in the real world but amusing in an
Illuminated one), a clever player might notice that the Five Sisters
subsector was originally named District 267, and 2+6+7=15 and 1+5=6
therfore we "know" that the number 6 is highly significant for the Five
Sisters subsector. The Five Sisters Subsector was named (Regency
Sourcebook pg 48) by "the merchant captain Ignaz Rufferlan who was the
first Imperial to explore this area. He founnd a cluster of five
inhabitable worls which he laid claim for and named for his
daughters...."  Five daughters and one merchant captain father: 5+1 = 6
more proof that 6 is numerologically significant.  Now what races does
the number six make you think of - maybe the Droyne (6 castes) and the
Hivers (6 limbs).  Even more interestingly the Hivers themselves have a
fascination for the number 7, could this represent the 6 types of Droyne
and the Hivers as the 7th type ? 

Hivers & Ithulkur for TNE implies that the assasination of Emporer
Strephon and the subsequent collapse of the Third Imperium was caused by
a Hiver Manipulation (Ever wonder _why_ Dulinor was unhappy with the
status quo ?).  Maybe the Hivers needed the Third Imperium out of the
way so that they could reach The Five Sisters subsector themselves. 
This would make the Hiver encouragement of their New Era client state,
THe Reformation Coalition, highly significant, especially since we know
that The Regency and The Reformation Coalition were supposed to meet one
day....

We have always assumed that he is not only a Zhodani trained psionicist
but is in fact a Zhodani national of Imperial descent.  Biologically he
is a Solomani/Vilani mix, like most Imperials, but he is culturally
Zhodhani & comes from a planet in the Spinward Marches (probably in the
Chronar Subsector) that was Imperial before the First Frontier War but
is now Zhodani.

This optional background already makes him fairly interesting and would
tend to preclude his being a Templar but if you wanted to make Branj
Dilgaadin a really complicated charecter you could make him a Templar as
well.

Possibly his Special psionics includes some form of Advanced Telepathy
that gives him a compartmentalized mind, so even a mind scan that gets
past his shields would reveal a "shell" mind. :)

Calling them "Templars" may sound cool but is not very smart; many sophonts
(especially PCs) will know about the historical Templars and will be
instantly suspicious of any group using the name. Even calling the \'front\'
organization the Templars would be too obvious and arouse suspicions. More
likely, "Templar" would be an epithet used by their political opponents.

I am very reluctant to make any of the innermost circle psionic; adding yet
another psionic society after the Zhodani, Psionics Institute, Psionic
Knights, and Droyne is risking overuse. It is also inconsistent; according
to canon most Imperial society is very suspicious of psionic individuals.
Why would a secret society be less suspicious than the rest of the
populace? More likely, they would be even more vigilant agains psionic
takeovers. Plot-wise, it is totally unnecessary to make any of the Templars
psionic. A group of nobles with connections to the throne,
megacorporations, military, and TAS is already plenty powerful enough.

Nor do I have any intention of adding a galaxy-wide instantaneous psionic
communication grid. This is completely non-canon and unbalances the game.
Limited speed of communication is a fundamental aspect of the Traveller
universe, and so far as I am aware even the Ancients did not have
instantaneous communication. The Ancient base in Twilight\'s Peak certainly
did not. The economic advantage of instantaneous interstellar communication
is so overwhelming I cannot believe the Templars would not use it regularly
with enormous charges. Even the knowledge that instantaneous communication
is theoretically possible will affect research and commerce.

The original Templar idea, that of a secret society which would protect
weaker groups from rapacious PCs, seems to have grown into a gargantuan
conspiracy so powerful there is little probability, and even less reason,
that it remain secret. The proposed group could knock over the Third
Imperium in an evening if it wanted to. Since it is so powerful any group
of PCs would be little threat, it is also uninteresting drama-wise.
Consider some of the established societies in Traveller; the Traveller\'s
Aid Society and the Octagon Society. Are they interesting because they
rival the Third Imperium in might? No. They are interesting because they
have a well-described background with plenty of hooks for players to
interact with them. I feel the Templars would be more interesting if they
were more like the Octagon society and less like Lensmen.

It is my experience that any secret organization that has a name is a pretty poor secret 
organization. The best secret organization is named after the fact, and does not, under any 
circumstances, call themselves Illuminati, Templars, Hospitallers, Star Chamber or such.
If they have a name it is probably something like the CEO\'s Glee Club or The Municipal 
Committee for Progress

Cults website)

Order of the Solar Temple 

Among the members of the Solar Temple who were found dead in Switzerland last October 
was a mayor, a journalist, a civil servant and a sales manager. Computer records seized by 
Canadian police in Montreal showed that some members had personally donated over $1 
million to the cult\'s leader Joseph Di Mambro. But the respectability of these followers\' 
public lives was in massive contrast to the bizarre small cult they had joined. 

The cult believed that Di Mambro had in a previous life been a member of the Knight\'s 
Temple (during the Crusades, naturally) and that he would lead them, through death, to the 
planet of Sirius. During ceremonies, they wore Crusade-type robes and held in awe a 
sword Di Mambro said had been given to him 1,000 years ago. He claimed that his 
daughter Emanuelle was \'the cosmic child\' and had been conceived without sex. When a 
couple in the cult called their own son Emmanuel, Di Mambro declared it the Antichrist and 
ordered the family\'s murder. This was carried out ceremonially, shortly before the whole 
cult decamped from Canada to Switzerland. (The boy\'s mother, Nicky Dutoit, was from 
East Sussex.) 

Later investigation revealed that 69-year-old Di Mambro had moved to Canada following 
tax problems in his native France. He had convictions there for practising psychology 
without a licence and for bouncing cheques. He had also founded a school near the Swiss 
boarder called the Centre For The Preparation For The New Age, the proceeds of which 
had enabled him to buy a 15-room mansion in the Haute Savoie. 

It has been rumoured that Di Mambro in fact disguised his own death at one of the two 
Swiss mass suicides, both of which were destroyed by fire. In all, 53 members of the cult 
died. 

Reason to join: You might meet someone who fought in the Crusades. 

Reason not to join: Suicide pacts can ruin your week. 

Bottom line: \'Liberation is not where human beings think it is. Death can represent an 
essential stage of life.\' - Luc Jouret, deputy leader of the Order of the Solar Temple.

Powell\'s is no mere tourist spot; it\'s more like a pilgrimage destination.
I know many people who have gone to Portland, Oregon for a conference or
something, only to come away raving about Powell\'s. :)

What\'s worse, there are now, what, four or five Powells locations in and
around PDX?   Siiiiigh.

I, too, consider the idea of calling this organization "the Templars" 
questionable, but for a different reason: the historical Order was active
thousands of years before "the present," even in Year 0.  At Imperium\'s
core, students of ancient Terran history might know who the Templars were,
but there would be so much Vilani and Sylean history to keep track of that
the Crusades wouldn\'t shine quite so brightly.  Would a group of 20th
century Americans name a secret society after some ancient Assyrian group? 
In Solomani space, the historical Templars might still have a claim on the
imaginations of would-be conspirators and armchair historians, but at the
Imperial core?  I really doubt it.

However...
Here\'s an alternative "Templar history" for the group\'s consideration:

I can easily envision a very "Templar-esque" Order developing during the
Long Night, dedicated to keeping the shipping lanes free of pirates.  Such
a group (the "Ur-Templars") probably weren\'t very noble...indeed, they
might have been little better than pirates themselves (charging
exhorbitant rates for convoy escorts, and muscling out competition). As
the Sylean Federation grew and restored Law and Order, the "Ur-Templars" 
would have become unnecessary, and might have faded into the background
(or dropped their militaristic tendencies to avoid getting Purged, and,
like the historical Templars of Terra, gone into business, perhaps
becoming some kind of long-distance shipping line, a courier company, an
arms manufacturing firm, or some such thing, adapting the "military
infrastructure" to commerical ends).

But the "Ur-Templars", at their militaristic prime, during the Long Night,
would be swashbuckling figures of romance in Year O.  The "Ur-Templar
Order" might have squabbled and SPLIT as the Sylean Federation grew.  One
branch decided to "go into business," and turned into some kind of
Federation-spanning corporation (which probably got gobbled up by one of
those incredibly durable big Vilani corporations, but might still exist as
a name and a few strange traditions, just as several extinct car companies
still exist within General Motors).  The OTHER branch of the "Ur-Templars" 
decided to go, in an informal and very covert way, into politics.  This
branch of the organization would be VERY strong in the Federation\'s Navy
and the Scout Service, and might have gained influence in the circles
which would become the Imperial nobility, via "old naval families."
Restoring the Rule of Man, under an Emperor of Solomani descent, was
probably one of the goals of the "secret, political branch" of the
officially-extinct "Ur-Templar Order." 

Whaddya think?

Of course, Emperors are seldom know for their gratitude.  Cleon himself
might be happy with those King-Making descendants of the "Ur-Templars," 
but I can easily see him (or one of his descendants) becoming VERY nervous
about "Templars" in the Imperial Navy, and certain aristocratic circles. 
Perhaps "the Great Templar Purge" is something for around "Milleu 200" 
This is where my theory regarding "Imperial Marine commanders as
unofficial political officers" comes into play...(to keep an eye on all
those unreliable "Temp-symp" blue-blood naval officers). 

Yes, they need a new NAME - I agree, calling \'em "Templars" is silly - but
I think a "Templar-esque Order" dating back to the Fall of the Rule of
Man, or the bleakest times of the Long Night, is entirely plausible,
provides enough of a "swashbuckling romanic aura"

There\'s "membership" and there\'s MEMBERSHIP. You won\'t get anything but

Uh, Craig? 

When skulking, I\'ve found that it helps to pay attention to what may be

How many points are there on a Mnaran star-stone?

I *did* post it. Probably in the same message after a "spoiler space".

Anyway, it\'s quite simple. The windows look out on interstellar space
(which has a radiation temp of 3K). Since the crumbs aren\'t terribly
conductive thermally, and they have a low mass the side facing the
window cools off quite a bit. 

Now the crumbs are being bombarded ion all sides by air molecules.
These average out as fas as which side they bounce off of. But when
they hit and rebound, the speed of the rebound depends on the temp of
the surface they are rebounding from. So they rebound slower from the
"cold" side of the crumb. Which means that it gets a net momentum
*towards* the window. 

As I said in the original, I have no doubt that *someone* will find a
way to use this to set up a practical joke....

It also means that on ships with big observation windows, you *will*
get chilled on the side facing them. (Which is why you take your date
up to the observation deck. She gets "chilled" and you are there to
warm her up. :-)

The dart is moving at a fair fraction of *orbital velocity*. It\'ll
explode on contact with *anything* that is remotely solid. As noted the
kinetic energy of an object moving at 5000 m/s (5 km/s) is equal to the
energy released by detonating a piece of TNT that weighs 2.7 times as
much.

Even at velocities as low as 1500-2000 m/s you start getting the
"explode on impact" effect. 

Look at it this way, the dart has *so much* kinetic energy that the
energy release caused by something solid/liquid starting to slow it
down will *vaporize* it. 

BTW, the dart *must* be conductive, but it doesn\'t need to be magnetic.
The "rails" are inside the barrel. They act as contacts for the dart.
It slides along them while conducting lots of amps from one rail to the
other.

The potentiometer required would have to have windings of wire *thicker*
than the rails. Otherwise you\'d lose to much current (or just plain
*melt* them). We\'re talking about something like 100 amps (probably
*more*). The wires from the powerpack to the rails are going to be
about as thick as a pencil.

Consider, if the dart weighs 20 grams, at 5000 m/s it has a KE of 500
kJ. And I already figured in a previous message that it takes 400
*microseconds* to travel the length of the barrel. Which means that we
need 1.25e9 *gigawatts* of power during those 400 microseconds. Getting
that without arcing over the rails requires some *very* high currents.

The Auroro Aglo class Support Cruiser was first built for the RaTanie Def=
ense
Forces (RDF) by Starkin Shipyards.  The RDF needed a ship capable of
transporting and supporting a full company of troops.  Despite the Auroro
Aglo\'s cost, it was selected by the RDF because of its depth of systems a=
nd
facilitates.  At first the Auroro Aglo class were all built with a Meson =
Gun,
but with time the RDF requested a second version built, with the Meson Gu=
n
omitted.  Eventually a total 209 Auroro Aglos were built for the RDF, 143
Meson Gun ship and 66 others.  After the production of ships for the RDF
ceased, Starkin Shipyards still continued building the Auroro Aglo class =
for
other planetary governments and private parties.  In this fashion Starkin
Shipyards produced 42 more ships, with about half of them being the fully
stripped-down version.  Today only two Auroro Aglos are in service with t=
he
RDF, however, many other Auroro Aglo Cruisers can be found around in use =
by
independent mercenary companies and lower tech planetary navies.

Random thoughts:  When designing the ship I really liked the idea of havi=
ng
the ship tricked out with all the goodies.  This of course resulted in a
design that may be too expensive for some, so, I included a version of th=
e
ship with many of the goodies removed.  It seems that SSDS requires
sandcasters to have a MFD.  This is inconsistent with QSDS and results in
sandcasters not being the inexpensive defense that they should be, so I
ignored this requirement.

Yes, but to those of us that live there it\'s a curse!  I ought to know,
considering what I just spent there yesterday!

>around PDX?   Siiiiigh.

Yes, but only three count.  The main store in downtown, the technical
bookstore, and the Washington Square store.  A good example of size, the
Technical book store probably has more books than the average Barnes &
Noble, and about half are on Computers!  There is also a cookbook store, a
travel store, and a shop at the airport.  The downtown store is where they
started they\'ve been there for years, but the rest have mainly shown up in
the last ten years.  It\'s a case of the downtown store being an entire city
block (about half multi-story), and not large enough to hold all the books!

To get on topic, both the main store in downtown, and the Washington Square
store have a few (very few) Traveller items.  However, the classic stuff is
on the HIGH side, price wise.  I really wish they would carry more RPG
stuff, the downtown store just seems to stock used.  The Washington Square
store has a good selection of new, in fact that\'s where I got my copy of
"Delta Green".

The airport store has saved me more than once; it\'s not often you can pick
up a good SF novel or (especially!) a Patrick O\'Brian novel while on the

Off Off Topic.

The month before Red October was published, I met Tom Clancy at a game
convention (he was therewith Larry Bond). Tom passed out bound galleys of Red
October (that, I guess, is a pre-first edition).

We played a Harpoon scenario trying to get the Red October past and Alpha and
into port. Afterwards, he inscribed my copy to the character / role I
played.. Marko Ramius.

The Templars and Hospitallers didn\'t start out as secret organisations.
It\'s pretty plausible that organisations resembling them will have some
high-sounding names.

_GURPS Illuminati_ has a sample secret organisation called TRI, which stands
for "Three Random Initials".

I see nothing inherently strange about that notion. Provided they were
setting out to be a pseudo-secret (a "let\'s pretend" sort of) organisation
to start with. If they grew into one, they\'d propably have some utterly
mundane name.

If organized as an order of knights dedicated to keeping open the starlanes, 
they might\'ve called themselves the "Knights Stellar".

There is a five story warehouse in Detroit called John King Books.  I
don\'t know if this is the largest or best, but I go there and enjoy
being surrounded by five stories of antiquity.  Ahh, the smell alone is
worth the trip.  Nothing like many old books under one roof.

I always thought that it came from the hit single of the 1960s C.E. that was enjoying a 
revival:  "Soul Man".  ("I\'m just a souuul man...." or something like that.)

Thus the images that Hiroshi was seeking to convey were several:  (1) the Solomani have 
soul -- they\'re not heartless corporate automatons like the Vilani; (2) the Solomani 
have roots -- their theme song is really old; and (3) the Solomani are up to date -- 
their ancient theme song is really popular right now.  Maybe a fourth point is that the 
Solomani are men (and women), not sexless corporate automatons like the Vilani.

an excerpt from the QSDS charts (draft):

     QSDS
     The Quick Ship Design System (QSDS) provides the ability to design
spacecraft, starships and small craft for Traveller quickly (a typical design
takes less than 30 minutes) and easily. The system is based on standardized
components which are selected from lists. So long as the components selected
do not exceed the capacity of the hull, the ship design is acceptable.
     QSDS provides for design of craft and ships of 10 tons or more, and up to
5,000 tons. It does not allow for customized ship components.
     QSCS. Ships designed using QSDS resolve combat based on the Quick Ship
Combat System (QSCS).

STARSHIPS AND SPACECRAFT 
     A craft is any space vehicle. A ship is at least 100 tons. A small craft is
any craft under 100 tons.
A spacecraft is any craft capable of travelling between worlds.A starship is
any ship fitted with a jump drive.
All starships are spaceships; not all spacecraft are starships.

<snip>

SPACE COMBAT RANGES
Range     Name Value
     6    Distant / Boarding  5 km
     7    VDistant  50 km
     8    Regional  500 km
     9    Continental    5,000 km
     10   Planetary 50,000 km
     11   Far Orbit 500,000 km
     12   Interplanetary 1 AU
     13   Outsystem 10 AU
     14   Oort 100 AU
     Subtract 6 from range number to determine the number of range bands between
two ships.

<snip>

STANDARD COMPONENTS
     The QSDS design sequence uses standard components. Only the specific prices
and details can be used (components cannot normally be purchased
fractionally). 
Tech Level: Ships and ship components are assigned tech levels (which reflect
the level of technology required for repair). Standardized components are
available regardless of the tech level of the world on which the building
shipyard is located. Similarly, replacement standardized components are
available regardless of the tech level of the world on which the repair
facility is located.

QSDS standard components up to TL 12 are typically available for repair
installation at any class A or B starport, or for construction at any class A
starport. QSDS components above TL 12 are available only at the appropriate
level starport with an appropriate TL.

STANDARD MISSIONS
     The mission of the ship being designed is the primary purpose for which it
is constructed. Typical missions and their requirements are:
     Passenger. Carries passengers.
     Trade. Carries speculative cargoes.
     Transport. Carries freight for profit.
     Survey. Surveys unknown systems.
     Scout. Explores unknown systems.
     Patrol. Conducts military missions.
     Tramp. Outfitted for a variety of trade missions.
     Yacht. Outfitted for luxury voyages.

I would use the rules for making a Mass Driver and place it in a ship with
no jump drive, no crew, a good sized computer and next-to-no manuver
drive.  I\'m not sure how big a \'rock dropper\' you want, but if you
accellerate it to the likely terminal velocity in atmosphere, and make it
a 2 ton piece of molybdenum coated iron ("relativistic crowbar"...well,
far from relativistic, but fast anyway), ou can do some serious damage to
anything on the ground (building sized, not city sized).

Canonically - I believe - no.  In practice, if you know the range of the
vessel you can make good guesses.  If you are the GM I\'m sure you can come
up with something.  In my Traveller Universe there is a way; The ship has
to point in the direction of the destination.  Quite simple really.

I\'ll let Joe Walsh answer that one.

I do not mean to imply, in the rest of my response to your Rant, that
ranting is not allowed.  That said;

Well, you ask if we should debate or discuss game mechanics, but the
implied question that you are ranting over is whether IG will ever get its
act together.  Of course we should discuss game mechanics, but to the
other question;

Is it time to pick up this thread again already?

I think not.

We faced the same question about 3-4 months ago on this list.  At that
time, a few souls suggested that ranting about the game as published and
IG was taking up the entire productive time of the list, and they were
quite right.  I believe you were here then and perhaps had the experience
I did of deleting 90% of the list traffic without reading it.

From that or after that, came the THUDDD Contests, possibly (IMHO) the
most productive ship building time of the list (aside from Rob Prior\'s
single handed MT design plethora).  Many other interestin rules and
designs also came up.  The Ken Whitman bashing and IG bashing was, by
mutual agreement, put off \'til later. 

It was thought that Courtney Soloman and crew needed some time.  Time to
take over, time to put out a few products and prove their worth.

Since then we\'ve had only 4 products.  There has yet to be a major
overhaul of the basic systems.  Folks, its only been *4 Months*.  If we
really want to give them time to get their ducks in a row I think we\'ll
need to wait some more.  They must deal with what has been published
before them, and that ain\'t no picnic.

In the meantime they have given us what I think are three out of four good
products (the fourth being First Survey, which arrived decidly broken).
This gives me hope and buys them more time on my account.    

I encourage working with the game mechanics and posting alternate rules.
this may in fact work its way into some second edition basic rulebook
(there is one of those coming out though, right?).  I think this list is
and continues to be an incubator and source for material in the game.  It
requires quite a bit of fixing and adapting before being published (which
I am not certain all the book publishers/editors know at IG) but if that
weren\'t true, why would we need a publisher?

So a gauss weapon (specialized) that fires at this velocity keeps its ammo

T4 Deluxe is being prepared by Marc Miller, with assistance from Guy
Garnett on the revised QSDS rules.  

In preparing T4 Deluxe, Marc is taking the original T4 book as a basis.
He is then ensuring that all the typographical and grammatical errors
are fixed. Also, on a system-by-system basis, he is making sure
everything works properly, is clearly written, and is optimally liad out
(i.e., if you read the text once, you should be able to follow the
tables with ease every time thereafter).  

Specific systems to be changed include:

Character Generation:  Pre-career options, such as college and military
academies are being changed to make more sense, offer more
differentiation, and so on.  Careers will each take up one full page,
and will include all the information necessary to creating a character. 
The "homeworld generation" tables will be changed completely; you will
roll up the homeworld\'s *trade codes*, and work with the referee from
there to determine which specific world the character came from (there
will be assistance provided for this in the tables - i.e., it won\'t
leave you with a character that must have come from a world out in the
Massilia Sector when your campaign is in the Core sector). 

Tasks:  We\'ve all seen the new task system by now.  The progression is
2D/2.5D/3D/4D/5D.  Tasks are expressed in a specific format.  And so on,
as given in Marc\'s post from a few weeks ago.

Skills:  The skill tables will be restated to also show skills grouped
by which characteristic each is related to.  That is, there will be a
column showing all skills that use Strength as a basis, then another
column showing all skills that use Dexterity as a basis, and so on. 
Also, Marc will ensure that no one characteristic has significantly more
skills than the others (i.e., Edu in the current T4 edition).

Personal Combat: I don\'t know what changes will be made to this, but
given some of the changes in the task system, this will have to be
changed at least slightly as well.  Also, we know Marc will have better,
more complete, tables for combat.

Vehicles:  Lots more vehicles.  You saw the list Marc posted to the
list.  There will be vehicle cards included in the volume (like the ones
included in Belters and Tarsus) that will work as handouts, providing
all the data necessary for each vehicle.

QSDS:  You\'ve seen what he\'s doing here.  Making it work better, make
more sense, and so on.

QSCS:  You\'ve also seen some of this.  He\'s making a rational combat
system that allows players to quickly resolve space combat.

Psionics:  There will be a restatement of this chapter as well.  Also,
the arbitrary limit of 6 on psionic discipline skills will be abolished.

Animal Encounters: Marc will restate this chapter to include rules for
animals attacking humans.  The original T4 volume provides no rules for
this.

Every Adventure Begins and Ends at a Starport: you\'ve seen a draft of
this chapter; it was posted a couple of weeks ago.  Essentially, it
states that the starport is the starting line and finish line of every
adventure.  It also provides details on what sort of facilities are in
existence on starports.

That\'s all I know about T4 Deluxe at this point.  Look for additional
rules draft postings by Marc Miller - and be sure to comment on them!


Emperor\'s Arsenal, Game Screen
- ----

Both of these products shipped at the end of last week.  These are the
first two products produced entirely under the new management and game
design process. You\'ll see lots of changes to the presentation of the
material, especially tables.


Pocket Empires, JTAS 26
- ----

The final changes to Pocket Empires are being completed today (i.e., the
last few things Marc wanted changed).  Tomorrow it will go off to get a
final copy edit, then into typesetting, layout, and finally to the
printer. It will be shipped in April.

JTAS 26 is complete except for the cover art. It will be shipping in
April as well.


On the Horizon

Anomalies is very close to being completed (the writing stage anyway). 
Psionic Institutes is more than 1/3 written.

- ----Sylea   090-21----

The tallying of the votes for future ship designs has taken somewhat longer
than we had originally anticipated, but I\'m proud to announce that we are
ready for the next design competition.

For the next two weeks (until 103-21) we will accept designs that are
submitted for the next competition.  After that time, all entries will be
posted and the voting will begin for another two weeks (until 117-21) at
which time the winner will be tabulated and announced.

We have determined that a new voting system will be more appropriate and we
will be announceing more about that in the future as the time for votes gets
closer.  As always, it is expected that designs will follow the format
listed by the Wildstar Foundation for Standards in Imperial Shipbuilding.
If anyone is unaware of these standards, QuipTech is able to provide them at
no charge, simply send a request to tiger@goldinc.com and the information
will be forwarded.

Now, for the moment you have been waiting for, the next design parameters.
The next ship design will be for a standard patrol cruiser.  Design
parameters are:

# Must be capeable of standing alone against groups of pirate/raiding vessels.

# Must be able to work in conjunction with larger fleet actions.

# Must be capeable of wilderness refueling (Either directly or small craft)

# Must be cost effective (not necessarily cheap or inexpensive).

# Must be under 600 disp tons.  This requirement has been placed on the
designs in order to facilitate rapid construction of this vessel to help
assist in quenching piracy in the rapidly expanding imperium.  (ie. smaller
vessels can be built faster.)

# Required Minimums:
      Jump:  2                     Maneuver:  2
     Cargo:  Minimal          Carried Craft:  As Needed
   Offense:  Above Average          Defense:  Superior
      Crew:  Must have full medical facility.
             Must provide quarters for additional command personnell.  
                   (For inspections, and transport)

Well, there it is folks.  I think it is pretty self evident when you get
through the role-playing.  The 600-dt limit makes sense to me, if everyone
else hates it, well, you are the voters.

Also, I read VERY VERY few TML\'s any more, so please direct questions
directly to me.  I cannot promise that they will be answered otherwise.

Wasn\'t this list administered from Tektronix for many years?  That\'s where
I first encountered it back in the late \'80s I think.  Anyway, that might
explain the high proportion of Portland people (or ex-Portland people).

Finally!  I\'m going to vent to the list now, if this book has *any* errors,

continue to spend money on books that need revison immediately!

That feels much better, thank you.

I hope he includes a bit about the creative use of different characteristics
with skills.. i.e. using Using INT with Heavy Weapons to figure out how to
fire the Zhodani plasma gun.

Two words: Greg Porter.  Let Greg at the system, and we\'ll have something to
be proud of.  What combat needs is a quick-kill rule, deterioration of
wounds, and a basic hit location system.  We can always write some advanced
combat rules later, but these are the minimums.

Good, especially with all the talk of Conspiracy telepaths going around...

I wonder iof my adventure got into it.. I know they bought it, and I could

You could try reverse engineering the MT to TNE characters rules in

Yeah. Unclaimed resources! The Confederation has the

Something that all the major empires _except_ the Imperium

A great place to set scouting/first contact adventures. You

They\'re a snap to convert, though. We never "upgraded" to

remaining with a melange of CT, MT and house rules. When 
TNE came out and I bought it, one of the things I didn\'t

Modifying them into Basic MT generation sequences was no

You\'re going to hear  that it won\'t work in Traveller,

junk...not worth capturing or refitting.      I obviously 
don\'t agree.  ;-> I want Letter\'s of Marque, boarding

is to arrange things so that ship systems can be "knocked  
out" without being destroyed.  If you can temporarily 
silence a ship\'s guns  and maneuver drive, you can call on 
your victim to surrender...or board,  and take her if she 
refuses. <<

Well, the combat rules we use (this bit comes from MT IIRC) 
have the notes that (I forget the details) damaged systems 
can be repaired in one (ship) combat round if you have a 
full damage control team. So it must be possible to repair 
ship systems "in the field". 

The only two that _have_ to be fixed in order to get a 
prize home are the M and J drives. Life support can be 
replaced by having your prize crew live in vacc suits for 
the trip home - hefty bonuses make it tolerable! The 
computer can be swapped for one of your spares, or even one 
from an auxiliary vessel; or the jump co-ords can be worked 
out by the capturing vessel and fed over to the J-drive. 
Guns won\'t be needed before you reach a shipyard.

And even after a few critical hits, a starship 
hull-and-surviving bits is still worth a smegging fortune 
if you can get it home!

Hey, Loren, does this mean you got the GDW AOL account as a 
mustering-out benefit from the old mob? :)

>> However, someone from IG recently  told me that, yes, 
this is correct and it does mean that even a perfectly  
maintained and operated ship has a 1/36 chance of 
misjumping. Unless I  misunderstand something, this is bad. 
   Since practically no ships carry enough fuel for a 
second jump, since the  probability of misjumping to within 
maneuver drive range of a fuel source  is nil, and since 
most ships don\'t have the power or supplies for  
interstellar travel with maneuver drives, ships that 
misjump are  effectively lost. <<

Not entirely true. Human ingenuity has a lot of ways to get 
round this. 1) The ship\'s auxiliaries will all have fuel 
which can be siphoned into the jump tank. 2) The 
maneuver/plant fuel will be seperately stored to J fuel and 
can have some transferred - you don\'t need the power plant 
capacity your weapons require if you\'re doing an emergency 
jump. I design my ships with two Durations - one armed and 
one with weapons and screens.  3) There are many sources of 
water aboard a ship in emergencies. Apart from the LS 
complement of water, there are cargoes and there is the 
inevitable crates of beer for the PCs. Dump all that 
straight in the purifier. Tank of fish in the captain\'s 
cabin (a la Jean-Luc Picard)? In the purifier. Bowls of 
fruit? Juice \'em and strain \'em.

Sooner or later, you can rustle up enough fuel for one jump 
to safety. 

Added to all this, given the known properties of misjump, I 
refuse to believe that Jump fuel isn\'t sectioned into 
seperate Jump-1 tanks. So unless you\'re at maximum jump, 
there will be more fuel available.

Most of the "excitement" of misjumps should come from the 
"where the hell are we?" bit and the "how badly damaged are 
the J drives?" bit.

Having said all this I still agree that properly maintained 
ships running purified fuel should only misjump about 1 in 
100 or so. Then again, what\'s the chance of an accident and 
injury in a car journey today? Yet we still use cars!

I downloaded the ST emulator for the Mac as suggested. Takes about 15 min

Burden\'s Atlas v0.3 in the floppy drive in ST High mod. Worked fine.
Transfered the files to the Hard disk - had a slight problem with that -
the version of the program I have assumes that it\'s running on a floppy so
you have to manually redirect it to the sector files on the HD.

Anyway - it ran fine, and following checks *appears* to work great in up to
256 colours on a 68LC040 Powerbook @ 66 MHz. Can\'t say how it\'ll work on a
PPC Mac or a slower machine, but it was significantly faster than an ST. If
you\'ve got a Mac it\'s worth looking at... IMO, although IIRC there are some
better programmes around that do the same thing. (If you find one, let me
know!)

Only other minor problem is that the software I downloaded is in German,
but if you experiment (or have used any modern ST programmes) you can
muddle through easily enough once you work out that apple-W gets you to the
finder (for setting changes) and that you have to select a \'shutdown\'
command to exit.

Have fun! Dom

Greetings All,

First let me say until 9 months ago I hadn\'t even thought Traveller in over
ten years. In fact (sob) I sold my complete (Yes complete) original
collection at one point for the money. Nine months back a friend introduced
be to TNE, and an old friendship came back.

Now that aside, my questions are regarding Boarding actions inside Ship to
Ship combat. Roughly as stated in TNE, you may attempt to board once a
ship\'s maneuver drives are off line. This is all that is discussed regarding
the actual boarding section, as opposed to the taking of the ship.

My questions purpose, is to start a discussion about possible ways to board
a still moving ship.

Theory 2: If a missile can hit a moving ship, then a skilled pilot could
with work could get close enough to a ship to grapple (Mag grapples,
adhesive, old fashioned, whatever).

Theory 2: If you cannot see it, you cannot hit it, ergo you cannot dodge it.
Missiles are very fast moving no stealth applied spacecraft, that use some
manner of exhaust based thrust. It is possible to create rather fast moving
grav based space vehicles, this combined with stealth gear could create a
small enough profile to be unnoticed in a larger ship to ship combat. 

Given these theories it may be possible to get from one to five highly
trained troops onto the hull of an opposing starship. From there it is not a
mean feet to cause havoc of nearly any nature, given the right training and
equipment.


I am very interested in comments and tactical nukes. My goal is to devise as
realistic a scenario as possible. The best way is to shoot it full of holes
and patch it back to together with the leftovers.

Best,

I beleive that the name is just what we\'ve been calling them.  It makes it
easy to refer to a common point.  since we are discussing a *secret*
society, I doubt that their enemies will be making many public calls against
them.

The Templars were behind the Psionic Institutes; they served as a training
ground to identify the rare telepath who might be able to access the
Ancient\'s network.  Not that the prospect would know this.. his life would
be subtley manipulated and guided until he was ready to accept the risks of
connection.

The Droyne/Chirpers are naturally psionic, but remember that this fact isn\'t
well known even near the Imperium\'s fall!  Adventure 2 treats it as a
surprise that the Chirpers can turn invisible, and never mentions other
Chirper worlds.

There is no better way to hide your true power than to make it look like you
dislike the source of that power.  The Templars/Conspiracy use psionics for
a specific reason: discovering the secrets of the Ancients.  Their plots all
center around this, even if the connection isn\'t immediately clear.  At the
same time, they were probably behind the Psionic Supressions, simply because
the Institutes were getting to big to control, and the chance of a "rogue"
telepath connecting to the network and revealing its existance were rising.
Solution?  Make psionics anathema to Imperials.  Method?  Pull strings at
various levels to set the psychohistorical experiment that led to the
supressions in motion.. set up a few Institutes for a hard fall.. make sure
that a few unbalnced fanatics recieved training, and set them loose as
terrorists.  Bingo; withing 30 years the image of the psion will be the same
as a communist during the McCarthy era.

While any group can form a conspiracy, the point of the Templars, as Craig
and I have been developing them, is a conspiracy of historical scope.  If
you read the theories about the historical Templars and the Prieure du Sion,
and Scottish Rite Freemasons, etc; you see that it goes deep into many
strange stories and coinceidences.  The legend (or truth) is frightening to
behold, for the basic reason that it makes much of history a lie.  This is
the hook in the Traveller Templars.. this grand history reaching back over
2000 years, back to Old Earth, and a mysterious silver head..

Well, first I feel compelled to point out that no one has said it is easy to
use the network.  I gave a figure of 1 in 1000 telepaths being able to even
access it without immediately going mad, and that thousand will chosen from
the top 1% of trained telepaths.

Also, it is clearly stated that every Ancient site used different
technology, down to simple things like fasteners.  Given that 421 different
Ancients created thousands of bases, I don\'t find it difficult to beleive
that Yaskodray at one point created a network to communicate with his kids,
even if they didn\'t bother building FTL commo of their own.

Let\'s say that you found an alien artifact.. an antimater powerplant.
simple to use, easy to maintain.  If you were to put it on the open market,
you\'d be a billonaire in weeks; able to look down on Bill Gates as a pauper.
BUT.. this device is easily converted to a bomb.  A total converstion
weapon, hand grenades in the kiloton yield range.  Are you willing to risk
the devistation simply to get rich?

On the other hand, what do you think your life expectancy will be when Big
Oil learns you\'re about to put them out of business?

There are three reasons why the Templars aren\'t selling access to the network:

1> Network capable telepaths are rare, and burn out quickly.  The net is
used only for dire emergencies.

2> The network causes some of it\'s users to become quite powerful, and very
unstable.  The possibilty for wide scale destruction and death outweighs the
possible financial gains.

3> The loss of secrecy would destoy the Templars, something they find
unacceptable.

That must explain why the X-Files got cancelled after half a season.  

Seriously, there are times when secret societies remain quiet.  You seem to
believe that the Conspiracy could "knock over" the Third Imperium.  Who\'s to
say it didn\'t?  Olav hault-Plankwell was from the Spinward Marches.. what
possessed him to spend three years flying to Capital to take over the
Imperium?  Was he a pawn?  Might Dulinor have been a Templar, or a pawn,
when he shot the Stephon clone?  What if the Conspiracy knew that Strephon
was away, and deliberately timed the assassination for when it would cause
the most unrest?  The survival, and coronation, of Lucan put quite a crimp
in their plans, leading to the creation of the Brothers of Varian to try to
sl;ow down the pace of things while the Secret masters tried to salvage
something.

You want to know how easy it is to keep a secret?  In 1987, the 197th
Infantry Bde (my old unit), was scheduled to go to the National Training
Center at Ft. Irwin, Ca, for a regular training rotation.  During that
rotation, there was a vehicle accident that resulted in 7 deaths.

Sounds normal, right?  dig a little..  during the training cycle in
question, the OPFOR at Ft. Irwin had close to 35% of it\'s personnel on
leave.. hardly enough to run a 30 day cycle!  Also, at the same time, the El
Salvadoran Army launched an offensive against the FMLN.  A BBC camera crew,
covering the fighting, shot footage of a M1 tank moving up a road.  The
Salvadoran Army doesn\'t have M1s.  At the time, we were the only Army in the
world that did.

Those seven troops who died in the vehicle accident?  All were sent home in
sealed coffins, due to the alleged nature of the bodies.  The odd thing is,
all seven were from different units.  It\'s rare for an odd mix of troops
from different battalions and different ranks to end up in one vehicle together.

It seems that the US Army moved a brigade of mechanized infantry to Cental
America where it provided direct combat assitance to the Salvadoran Army in
their offensive.  I will not comment on the number of laws and treaties we
broke.

This story broke in 1993, during the debate over wether to award the Special
Forces who served in ES the Combat Infantry Badge.  It was promptly ignored.

If that can happen, I believe that the Templars are more than plausible.

As a side note, i have noticed someone creating an "order" for traveller
based on the Templars.  I think it would make more sense if it was based
on the Hospitaliers, because the Templars were disbanded during the 1300
and most of there wealth/propety was given to the Hospitaliers.

It makes even more sense if the order operates with (or has its roots in)
the solomani rim.

The emulator works just fine on my 604e/180 PowerMac.  I haven\'t tried
running anything, for the simple reason all I\'ve got is the emulator (I
collect them for some wierd reason, never know when you might need to run a
piece of VIC-20 software).

I\'ve got to agree about the German menu\'s being annoying, one of these
day\'s I\'m going to have to break down and learn German.  I keep running
into software or documentation that is only available in it.

Dont know complete details but i know Nuclear subs are completely self
sufficient in every aspect execept food and ammo.  They recycle air, and
the power supply works like a car, goes on for ever until you run out of
fuel, but there fuel is nuclear energy which lasts so long that the vessel
will rust before they run out of energy.

All the food is prepackaged.

    Unless it\'s requisite that they have a public identity, the CIA springs to

Marc,

I agree with Ken about the task system.  Yes, I have my own version of the
task system, but it doesn\'t look like you\'re interested in a slightly more
complicated system that includes an aptitide with each skill, so....the
simple alternative is Ken\'s KBv2.0.

For insects, there\'s a fairly obvious reason: the square-cube law
(structural area increases with the square of scaling (2x size means
4x support size) but volume to support increases with the cube (2x size
means _8x_ the mass to hold up!)) prohibits large (sentient-size) beings
equipped with exoskeletons.

As for "tree-like" beings, what about the much-discussed Hresh from ALIENS
ARCHIVE?  And the often-overlooked Ahetaowa from, er, some issue of
Challenge magazine in the mid- to late- 20\'s.

Since a potentiometer is a *variable resistor*, superconductors need

    'body' => 'I suppose it\'s time to report how Ken Bearden\'s version 2.0 task system has
been doing in my campaign. Overall, very well. It handles a variety of
tasks at both large and small target numbers far better than the original
task system in the book. You may be interested to hear some of the effects
and rulings I have made using the system.

One thing I worried about that turned out not to be a problem was the
effect of using more dice with the published DMs. I thought the effect of a
1 DM would be diluted when using 4 or 5 dice instead of 2 or 3, but this
did not seem to happen. Perhaps because using more dice tends to favor
average rolls over the extremes, a DM of 1 seemed to have just as much
effect with many dice as with only a few. Or perhaps it\'s because players
always try to get favorable DMs no matter how many dice they roll against.

I considered using the tripled skill target number for DMs (like Leadership
for initiative rolls, Brawling for unarmed strikes, et al) and opposed
tasks, but this seemed to unbalance the results. This is probably for the
same reason that more dice did not dilute the effect of DMs significantly.
Whenever the rules suggest a DM based on a skill level, use the skill level
and not the tripled target number.

I don\'t recommend modifying the attribute or difficulty when using a skill
level of 0. KBv2.0 handles skill-0 fine without special rules, just roll
the normal number of dice against the relevant characteristic alone.

I strongly suggest using 2 dice for Easy tasks and not just assume the
character automatically succeeds. Wounded or handicapped characters should
have a chance to fail even Easy tasks. This is another example where the
existing T4 task system breaks down; a character with a characteristic and
skill of 2 will always succeed an Easy task with the T4 rules and
practically never succeed an Average task. In KBv2.0 the same character may
fail an Easy task but occasionally suceeds an Average task.

I suggest dividing each target number by the number of actions when
characters attempt multiple actions. The existing rule, which say to divide
only the characteristic, was workable when characteristics almost entirely
determine success, but with KBv2.0 the skill contribution must be divided
also. This gives better balance and is easier to calculate.

One problem I did run into is with spectacular results. The current rules
make spectacular success too unlikely and spectacular failure far too
common with a large number of dice. Also, there must be a higher chance to
spectacularly fail the more dice you roll, otherwise an Impossible task is
no harder than a  Difficult task for characters with high target numbers.
The rule I have been using is that rolling 3 or more ones on a task roll is
a spectacular success and rolling 3 or more sixes is a spectacular failure,
rolling more than 3 increases the effects of the success or failure.
Rolling the same number of ones as sixes does not give a spectacular result
(the two effects cancel each other out). One problem with this method is
that if a weak character ever succeeds a formidable task he does so
spectacularly. Similarly, a superior character only fails average tasks
spectacularly. I find this unrealistic, and clever players can use these
effects to figure out target numbers I want to keep secret. Lately I have
ruled that you must miss your target number in addition to rolling 3 or
more sixes to spectacularly fail; if you roll 3 sixes but the total is
below your target number it results in an ordinary failure.

Another rule I have been using is to increase a skill\'s target number and
not its level when a character succeeds an experience check. This provides
some variation in characters who otherwise have the same skills, and
reduces the effect of skill increase through experience, which is too
generous in my opinion. When the target number exceeds a multiple of 3, the
skill level is increased by 1.

IMHO, KBv2.0 is a vast improvement over the existing task system. Marc and
IG should seriously consider it for Traveller Deluxe.

I also agree.  Although I seem to have missed Marc\'s posting for the
new task system (and can\'t comment fully), I see little reason to
cling to those pesky half dice when so many list members have voiced
their opinions against them.  Ken\'s KBv2.0 works.

        Sorry, but you need to re-check your timelines. By the time the
Geonee and the Vilani met, the Solomani have not ventured out of the Terra
system. The Vilani was the first human race to use J-drive, and the Geonee
race was the second. The Solomani developed J-1 in -2,431, and the
Vilani/Geonee meeting took place in -9,000. The difference is of six and a
half MILLENNIA (I do not recall the exact dates in Terran calendar, but,
roughly, the Geonee were already starfaring around four millennia before
Christ). As for the Zhodani, they discovered J-1 in -5,415, so it is a
difference of three and a hlaf millennia.

        The Solomani are just newcomers into interstellar travelling. The
Vilani and the Geonee are the only true "old ones"... as the word Geonee
indicates ;-)

Yes, it is called "flushing the bilges." The open the bilges to the outside
seawater (which is at a higher pressure) and flush it out. Apparantly you can
do some really nasty swirlies at this time, since if you flush a toilet when
it is going on it kind of works in reverse.

The missiles in TNE never hit moving ships, the use Nuclear pumped X-ray
lasers to damage it. But that is really neither here nor there.
Vector-matching isn\'t that difficult, especially with computer assistance:
disabling the targets maneuver drives would make it a snap. Otherwise I would
say it would be a Formidable task resisted by an Easy one (on the part of the
defender, much easier to dodge away then it is to match someone elses
movement). Of course, once locked on (mag grapples or whatEVER), the combined
mass will really slow down any attempt to get away, depending on relative
masses. If the attacking ship is considerably bigger, you might not even have
to board any troops (ala Star Wars, suck it inside). Of course, any failure
(much less catastrophic) on that Formidable/Easy roll, can you say consult
the Ramming rules?

There is a problem compared with a missile interception----you have
to match courses.  So you need to end up in the same place at the
same time, _and_ you have to share the target\'s vector.  Basically
this means intercepting the target with a very low closing velocity.

If you could do this, you end up allowing really nasty missiles
(since they could "dock" with a relative velocity of a few hundred
km/s if they chose to :-)

    'body' => 'Hey-

        Someone on the list asked about ship boarding scenarios (forgive me,
but I forgot your name, and the digest got deleted), and I wanted to share
some observations from my CT campaign, which included privateers and
boarding actions.
        In my Spinward Marches campaign, it was Imperial Naval Policy to
allow Regional Commanders (i.e. Grand Admiral Santanocheev, and later Norris
during the 5FW) the option of issuing Letters of Marque and Reprisal to
civilian ships during the course of open hostilities.  These letters had to
indicate specifically which types of shipping were valid targets (i.e.
Zhodani commercial transports, Zhodani troop transports, Sword World
merchant ships, etc.), and the Office of the Admiralty had to indemnify
themselves in the event that the privateers caused damage to Imperial
property.  The letters also specified a set duration, usually stating "until
the end of the present emergency, that is the State of War existing between
the Zhodani Consulate and the Third Imperium".  The intention of all this
was to keep the Letters of Marque from becoming a license to kill for
anybody with an armed starship.  During the Fifth Frontier War, Norris
actually persuaded Santanocheev to issue Letters of Marque during the early
stages of the war, largely by assuming the necessary  indemnification
himself, and quite a number of ex-Navy men became enthusiastic privateers.
Their efforts disrupted enemy supply lines and tied down valuable Zhodani
front line squadrons, and their largely unsung efforts were lauded by Norris
in a number of speeches at the conclusion of hostilities.  Once peace was
restored, the letters became invalid, and the surviving privateers (some
quite rich) went back to their civilian lives.
        The use of privateers was by no means limited to the Imperium during
the war.  The Sword Worlds have a long tradition of privateering during war
(and peacetime as well), and nobles are allowed to purchase Letters of
Marque from their governments at any time.  This arrangement stipulates that
all prize vessels must be sold directly to the government at a cut rate, and
the privateers are forbidden to hunt within the jurisdiction of the current
government and its allies.  During the war, enterprising young nobles from
Gram, Sacnoth, and Flamberge organized themselves into "joint ventures" and
gave birth to the infamous Privateer Squadrons of the period, some of whom
were still operating as of 1121.
        Privateer strategies were simple- attack soft targets, force their
surrender, board them and escape.  The bravest of the Imperial privateers
were fond of penetrating deep behind Zhodani lines and lurking around a busy
system\'s gas giant.  When a valid target arrived (like a lumbering Zho
merchantman), they would fire a number of warning shots and force the ship
to surrender.  This tactic worked best after the target had made orbital
insertion, which greatly limited its options as to maneuvering.  A prize
crew would board the ship, offload the crew (leaving them in disabled ship\'s
boats, pressurized cargo containers, or sometimes floating in vac suits),
complete refueling, and leave.  In the event that the target put up a fight,
the privateer was forced to exchange shots until the enemy lost the will to
fight, or was disabled.  Since the target was usually a merchant or supply
ship, this usually didn\'t take long.  Successful privateers were the ones
who knew how to pick their targets- large ships with minimal combat
potential were ideal.  Extended combat was to be avoided at all costs
because a.) you were shooting holes in your prize money, b.) they were
shooting holes in you, and you were a long way from a friendly port, and c.)
it was hard to form a prize crew if half your men were dead.  The rule of
thumb was that the privateer had to have at least twice the firepower of his
target, or else he was taking a huge risk.  The target either had to be
immediately convinced that battle was a foregone conclusion, or else the
attacker had to be able to do significant damage to the target ship
immediately.  Attacking enemy warships was foolhardy in the extreme, unless
a privateer was lucky enough to stumble across one already damaged in battle.
        Military boarding actions were common during the war, but rarely
intentional- that is to say, enemy ships who were unable to escape the
combat area due to damage found themselves boarded and captured, as opposed
to planned capture attempts.  Imperial Navy boarding drill worked in the
following manner:

1. Order the ship to surrender, hold their current course, and shut down
their power plant.  (The "hands up" call.  Imperial Captains are instructed
to attempt this first, as it removes the enemy ship\'s ability to fight and
maneuver.  It almost never happens, unless the enemy knows it hasn\'t a
chance of getting away.)

2. If the ship will not heave to, it must be disabled.  This means
eliminating weapons systems and maneuver potential.  As long as an enemy
ship can fire its weapons and make even small maneuvers, a boarding craft
cannot approach it and grapple effectively.  Boarding is handled by ship\'s
boats because no Captain in his right mind would run the risk of bringing
his ship into point-blank range of an enemy who could be playing possum.  Of
course, when firing on the enemy ship, there is always the very real
possibility of blowing it up- which, in my campaign, happened about a third
of the time.

3. Away boarders- Marine boarding teams are formed and led by a Naval
lieutenant (tradition), who use ship\'s boats to match velocity and attitude,
and grapple with the target.  This is an extremely difficult maneuver, and
all but impossible if the enemy ship is capable of maneuvering (see above).
Even a small miscalculation can result in a collision, with catastrophic
results.  Now comes the hard part.

4. Take the ship.  Boarders have only four options of getting inside the
ship:  the airlocks, supplementary accessways (e.g. cargo hatches, hangar
bays), holes made by battle damage, or breaching charges.  Airlocks are the
obvious entryways, and provide a choke point where the defenders can tie
down boarding parties at will, so they are generally avoided.  Supplementary
accessways are a better bet, as the defenders have to guess where the attack
will come from, and must disperse their forces to deal with every
possibility.  Holes already made by combat can be greatly advantageous
depending on their location, but if the adjoining sections of the ship are
pressurized, getting into the rest of the ship is problematic.  Breaching
charges are a last resort, because while it would allow you to enter the
ship at any location you desire, the act of blowing yet another hole in the
hull can cause damage to vital ship systems (all those power conduits, data
feeds, and life support lines have to run somehwere, after all).  This, by
the way, is one reason why a Naval officer leads the boarders- if they have
to make a breach, he presumably will know the best place to put the charge
to cause minimal damage.

        Once inside, Marine teams immediately drive for main engineering,
also establishing blocking positions to keep enemy crew in the forward
sections from sending reinforcements.  Once engineering is secure, the
bridge becomes the next objective.  From there the remaining spaces are
systematically cleared out, provided the defenders haven\'t already surrendered.
        Shipboard combat in my game centered on melee combat.  The rationale
(as has already been discussed in depth in earlier posts) is that a ship has
a lot of vital components that don\'t take too well to gunfire- control
consoles, screens, conduits, oxygen feed lines, etc.  As a result, most
shipboard fighting is done with blades or firearms using low-velocity
"safety slugs" (e.g. Glaser rounds).  The typical composition for a Marine
boarding squad of twelve men  would be four soldiers armed with six-foot
glaives (basically a long-bladed knife on the end of a wooden shaft), four
men with sabres (a combat duty sabre weighs 2.5 pounds, is 2.5 inches wide
at the hilt, and tapers to a sharp thrusting point), three sharpshooters
with semiautomatic carbines, and a sergeant armed with a sabre and a pistol.
Boarding armor is cerametal plate with a kevlar inner lining,  covering the
torso, shoulders, upper arms and thighs, and is worn over a lightweight vac
suit.  These squads work as coordinated teams, and used properly are very
formidable opponents.  The glaives are employed to clear out passageways,
while the sabre men do the close-quarters work in rooms.  The boarding armor
will stop nearly all low-velocity small arms fire, and in the event that the
defenders bring anything heavier to bear, the sharpshooters are called on to
take care of it.  In some cases the sergeant is entrusted with a number of
grenades for use in dire emergencies.
        In conclusion, boarding actions are often grim, bloody affairs, and
casualties on both sides are often high if the defender is determined to
make a fight of it.  One of my player groups decided to become privateers
during a 5FW campaign that I ran, and made a considerable fortune capturing
enemy merchant shipping.  They picked large, weak targets and generally
captured them without much struggle- the challenging part was getting the
prize back to an Imperial port!  Only once did they attempt to board a
heavily damaged Zhodani cruiser, which they caught trying to make repairs in
an isolated system.  It took three gaming sessions to resolve the boarding
action, and it was one hell of a fight.  When all was said and done, the
Zhodani crew fought to the last man, and the players had barely enough
manpower left to crew their own ship, much less claim their prize!  By the
time the war was over, they had developed boarding tactics to an art form.
        Sorry to take up so much bandwidth.  I hope this provides some grist
for the mill.

Good.  Then perhaps you can enlighten us regarding that pesky "falcon" that
people have been looking for, but which no one seems to have in their

up in California a few years ago, covered nicely by saying they were "just

Bet the cooks on board the boomers (reputed to be among the best in the
Navy) are surprised to hear that.

Also, IIRC, the fuel loading in a nuclear ship only lasts something
like 3-4 years....this is one of the big problems that the Soviet fleet is
having; what to do with all the spent fuel cores. They had been just
dumping it at sea, until they got caught.

On another, more off topic note, last month, a bunch of Columbian drug
smugglers were busted trying to purchase a used Soviet submarine,
presumably for smuggling purposes.

Just how close to the American coast did they expect to get, in an
ex-Soviet submarine??? Hasn\'t Hunt for Red October been translated to
Spanish yet? I think it would be a race between the attack subs, surface
ships and Navy aircraft to see who got to blow it up first!

Finally, COMPLETELY off topic, but I gotta say it:-)

In my universe there is a distinct difference between the ship\'s
maneuver drives (responsible for thrust in the forward direction)
and the ship\'s steering jets. The latter handle any close maneuvering
like docking. The number and size of the jets comes from the ship\'s
agility rating and reflect the ship\'s ability to "jiggle" around
to avoid incoming shots.

Thus, even with the maneuver drive totally disabled, you\'d still have
a hard time grappling. Think of it as two airplanes attempting the
same thing. If one airplane\'s engines are off (so it\'s gliding), it
can still steer and avoid grappling attempts. Of course, this example
can only be carried so far -- who\'d be stupid enough to grapple an
airplane?

In my universe, to effectively grapple, you\'d have to knock out the
bridge or computer so that nobody\'s steering the ship.

Why don\'t you just use the number from Central supply catalog as the basis
for space combat ranges:

subregional(10km)   
regional(30km) 
subcontinent(300km) 
continent(3,000km)

Could it be because everyone thinks bugs are icky? And trees don\'t run very

I have an insect-like sophont in the preliminary stages of writeup, which I
will be submitting to the Journal in the near future. I am not designing any
trees, at least not at the moment.

IMHO, the problem with large insects is not so much exoskeleton (although
that is a factor) as circulation. There is no reason why a non-Terran
lifeform with an exoskeleton could not have a better circulatory system than
terrestrial arthropods (did I spell that right?), so there is no reason _not_
to have intelligent insect-like critters.

KBv2.0 is the task system I designed to get rid of the problems with 
the T4 system.  One of these problems was those pesky little half 
die.

KBv2.0 is simple.  Here\'s the two steps to using it:

          Step 1)  Difficulty Codes.

          Change the difficulty codes you use to these--         Easy      2D/Auto
                                                                 
Average        3D
                                                                 
Difficult      4D
                                                                 
Formidable     5D
                                                                 
Staggering     6D
                                                                 
Impossible     7D


          Step 2)  Target Number Calculation.

          Change the way you calculate target numbers to this--

          Experience + Attribute

          (How do you come up with a character\'s experience?  3 x skill 
          level.  Record this number next to the character\'s skill for 
          easy reference during play.)



And that\'s it.  Make those two changes, and you are using KBv2.0.

I was concerned about this too when designing KBv2.0.  That, and the 
fact that 7 dice seems to be a bit much (but it sure makes the player 
think the task is VERY difficult, doesn\'t it?).  

Using the higher number of dice, the rolls do favor the middle of the 
distribution, but comparing the percentages to KBv1.1 and the T4 
system, KBv2.0 stands up nicely against anything else I\'ve seen for 
Traveller.

I agree again about rolling Easy tasks.  Depending on what the task 
is, I\'ll sometimes let my players automatically succeed, but in 
combat, they always roll for the Easy to hits.

This was my opinion about that rule as well.  I\'ve been using it 
since KBv1.1, and it works great.

I never intended the SS and SF rules written in T4 to be used with 
KBv2.0.  

I\'m working on a logical, simple rule for this, but I haven\'t had 
time to nail it down lately (thus, my lack of involvement on the TML 
of late.).

I\'ll post this as soon as I get it fininshed.

This implies that a ship designed with QSDS will be incompatible with any

Does this mean no more ships < 100 tons?

Well, I was actually thinking one would not need a "super" conductor, only
a really good one.  Also the choice of materials is dictated by how hard
that material is.  So if we found that the best room temperature
superconductor was, say, kiwi jello, we still would not want to use it as
a projectile, being as messy as it is ineffective.

Yes - the Order still exists - they operate one of the biggest 1st aid
training organisations in the UK - and seem to be based on, or near most
hospitals. They provide voluntary cover for many events....

That\'s where my company sent me for first aid training - I was surprised
when I noticed the \'order of St John\' placard on the will, mentioning
hospitals in Jersualem etc.

It wasn\'t.  There was much speculation that the Stuarts were supported
during their exile by Templars seeking to insure that Scotland would be a
safe haven.

that\'s what they *wanted* you to think.  there is considerable evidence that
the Templars existed, in one form or another, well beyond their
dismemberment at the hands of Philip II.

For a look at the sort of grand conspiracy we\'re considering, read "Holy
Blood, Holy Grail".. It talks a great deal about the Templars, the Prieure
du sion, and other shadowy groups.

Note:  If you are a devout Christian, some of the authors\' theories may
offend you deeply.  Be warned.

>It makes even more sense if the order operates with (or has its roots in)
>the solomani rim.

In my view, the Templars began as a group investigating why there were so
Many human races.  When they stumbled onto some Ancient artifacts, they went
deep underground to keep the Rule of Man from interfering with their
studies.  By the end of the Long Night, they realized that the center of the
mystery lay to Spinward, so the manipulated the Sylean federation into a
dynamic Empire, with a strong desire expand to Spinward.  BTW:  My vote for
Templar in Cleon\'s court is Artemsus Lentuli, who became Emperor himself in
54 and reigned for 92 years!

[I know, i know, a lot of agility in that sentence.]

The computer should be able to be set to read any and all velocity changes in
the target, and then compensate using the attitude jets of the more agile
ship. Pilot input for the bording ship could then be isolated and apply only
to relativistic course changes. In other words, the computer could
effectively hault the target ship as long as the Agility of the attacker was
higher.

The attacking ship would, of course, have to be able to generate enough
forward thrust as well.

Okay, to steer this back on topic somewhat, why don\'t we have small
submarine fighters, perhaps deployable from a attack sub or a boomer?
These could be small manned subs or even drones; presumably even a small
number of these would make normal tactics difficult for the opposing sub.

And given that for some reason we _don\'t_ have these, what (if anything)
does that say about the viability of small space fighters?  Thoughts?

Hear!  Hear!

It was a tough sell to my gaming group to switch our CT Campaign over
to T4, and not knowing any better, I just passed on the propaganda
surrounding the new system.  Everything went fine, until we tried to use
the QSDS, and then the ship combat system.  Now I just try to keep up
with fixes as they appear on the TML to pacify the group and keep them
from scrapping the whole thing and go back to the little black books.

Since all those who bought the T4 book(s) have served (largely via the
TML) as the test group for a gaming system sold to us complete and
intact, it seems appropriate that such a discount be offered when
purchasing the "Deluxe Version".

OK....I\'m done whining.

As far as i know the Templers cease to exists during the 1300 (sorry cant
give you a date).  The Hosiptaliers still exist to this day.  The current
Grandmaster is a scotsmen.

Well, no. The ship with the greater agility can out-maneuver the
other ship. To match vectors, however, requires that the "victim"
ship not be "jiggling" at all relative to the "captor" ship. 

If my car chases your car and my car can out-maneuver yours, I
still won\'t be able to pull up alongside and pass you something 
through the window if you\'re trying to evade me. I\'ll either not
be able to get close or I\'ll hit you.

I disagree. The computer of the pirate ship can\'t match random moves.
It can\'t anticipate the moves of the other ship.

I think we have a difference in wording here.  All the food is
"prepackaged" in the sense that none is grown/raised during the trip;
i.e., there is no livestock nor food plants on board.  BTW, during the Age
of Sail, both were routinely carried on long journeys.

And yes, an uncle of mine served on a boomer, and says the food and
general living conditions were astonishingly good.  The US Navy wants to
keep the people on board ships carrying a few hundred Hiroshimas *happy*.

Not necessarily.  There\'s not a huge amount of active ASW patrolling going
on during peacetime -- it\'s an expensive, labor- and equipment-intensive
process.  There is some, of course, but the net is more porous than you
might think.  Also, a lot of ASW tactics in the USN scheme depend on your
own vessels and threat vessels being (almost) the only things in the
water; during The Big One, the model was that merchant shipping would be
in USN-organized convoys, or idle in port.

With a zillion vessels of all sizes chugging around in offshore waters
(themselves a tricky sonar environment), it can get *very* hard to find
that Alpha crawling north just under the thermocline.  If the sub captain
knows a few tricks, it can get even harder.  For example, find a noisy
freighter headed more or less your direction, and cruise underneath it,
matching your blade rate to his. 

A full-tilt ASW operation, starting with approximate knowledge of the
sub\'s position, could still locate the sub within a few hours at most, of
course.  But we have neither the funding nor the staffing nor the
equipment to run ASW over our entire coastline 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year.  I\'d guess we\'d be lucky to hit 1% coverage, with the all USN ASW
assets devoted solely to coastal defense.  It\'s a big, noisy ocean, folks,
with many thousands of miles of US coastline. 

Remember, in _Red October_, they picked up Ramius at a chokepoint, and
tracked him continuously from there.

Heres the story,

The Island of Malta was given to the Hospitaliers in 1401 (or so) by the
Holy Roman Emperor, who was the King of Spain.  He only had two
conditions, a) the knights wouldnt raise in arms against his domain (which
was redundent because one of the knights vows was not to attack Christian
nations) and b) They were to give two Falcons a year as tribute to the
King.

The first Year of Tribute (1402) the Hospitaliers sent two Jewel Encrusted
solid gold Falcons.  Thats where the truth is at the heart of the Legend.

Rumour and conjecture now follow:)

One Falcon was lost, the other falcon some how made its way back into the
hands of the Hospitaliers centuries later.  The second falcon was stolen
by Napaleon when he sacked Malta in 1805 on his way to Egypt (the maltese
promptly ejected the French Garrison and joined the British Empire). 

This second Falcon resides in France (cant remember the name of the
museum) with the other sacked items.  The first falcon is lost, or is in
calfornia, one of the two :)

Your wish has been granted. [G]

IG has offered a discount on T4 Deluxe to those who purchased the 
original volume from the start.  See the web site for details (I believe 
it\'s under "news"), but basically you let them know you have a copy of T4 
(and when you purchased it, etc.), and place your order in advance (they 
don\'t charge you until they ship, though).  Then you get the discount. 
$10.00 I believe.

Get in touch with IG.

Hmmm, this may be the case, but for all intents and purposes they do not
exist, and they were dismembered.  The reason they were disbanded was
because they had past there time, and, as an orginisation they were no
longer useful.

My only point is, if your going to create an equivalent furturistic
military order, based on an Earth Religious/Military order it would make
more sense to base them on (or make them an extenstion of) the
Hospitaliers as opposed to the Templars, since teh Hospitaliers were NOT
disbanded, exist today, and have left a lasting testament to there beliefs
- - the hospital.

Then again, I havnt read much of the Templar thread, so cant say this is
what the creator wants.

So why are they called \'Templars\'?  They dont seem to reflect there

I received both the Emperor\'s Arsenal and the Game Screen today.  They 
are the first products handled entirely under the new management.  

Most of the interior art is by Bryan Gibson.  It looks quite good, IMO.  
I hope they use him a lot more.

As for the text, it\'s Greg Porter.  \'Nuff said.

Quick summary of what\'s included:  TL 0 through 16 weapons (the bulk of 
the book); Imperial Procurement Practices; New Weapon Rules 
(Malfunctions, Environmental Hazards, Special Weapon Effects); Weapon 
Technologies essay; Tactical Roles of Weapons essay; Chemical Weapons 
essay; No Nukes essay; Ammunition Costs essay; Law Levels essay.  

Every chapter has a summary table of the contents for the TL in 
question.  At the end of the book is a master set of tables, showing all 
weapons, organized by TL.

Looks good.  Very good.  I expect to use this a lot. :)


The Game Screen includes the "Memory Alpha" adventure which some of us 
may be familiar with. It\'s been altered to occur in M0. The screen itself 
is very nicely done.

Wow... this basically means that all the sections need to be rewritten
from scratch.  I\'m really curious whether this time it works out (and
again I was stupid enough to pre-order to copies of the Deluxe edition...
it\'s really his last chance as far as I am concerned).

Hopefully there *also* will be a table listing the skills sorted by topic
(e.g. military skills, scientific skills, wilderness skills, whatever),
since it\'s very annoying having to sift a large table if you just want to
quickly design a mercenary or whatever.

I also hope that the skill list will be more complete.

How about designing a realistic and fast combat system without requiring
(many) additional tables?  That would be a good design.  More tables don\'t
make for a better combat system.

Personally I\'d rather like to see a more extensive section on many
different ways of handling a Traveller campaign.  The starport plot might
work for some people but I find it too limiting if it\'s used as the sole
hook to start adventures (it somehow feels like dungeon-crawling in
space... "You meet at Starport XCVII and suddenly a stranger with a long
white beard approaches you...").

Soory for being suspicious, but the past failures really make me a little
jumpy :-)

We do have these...they\'re called \'torpedoes\' ;-)

Actually, The Hunt for Red October implied, somewhere I think, that we do
have \'decoys\' of some sort that go off to fool enemy sensors, much like
the old Quail drones that B-52\'s used to carry to fool SAM\'s. (or maybe I
saw or read it somewhere else...

     We may well not have them because so much of submarine warfare is
finding out where your enemy is, and blowing him up, hopefully without
making enough noise to let them know where you are. 

     The use of space fighters against capital ships is based more on
the paradigm of fighter aircraft attacking bombers or, more accurately,
dive bombers and torpedo planes attacking capital ships, a la the Pacific
fighting during WWII.

Okay,

To throw some variables into the mix.

A star fighter, or small vehicle is immensely more maneuverable that a
Starship. 

A small craft attempting to hit a nearby object with grapples, does not need
it to hold still to hit it.

While dangerous, jumping between vehicles is possible (Biplane to Biplane,
Truck to Truck, Boat to Boat).

With these variables in mind how would this modify the arguments.

Example- A small 5 ton grav driven spacecraft intercepts and matches
relative velocity with a 200 ton free trader. Using multiple grapples the
small craft latches onto the larger ship and reals itself in.

Different Variable Arguments

If you cannot see it, how can you dodge it?

How low a signature does a Grav craft have, how low if it is stealthed?

How capable our Starship sensor at detecting a very small craft when it is
less than a half klick away, a 100 yards, a 100 feet?

Even if a Starship can detect at short range, how much is directly available
to the pilot? At some point this data is so fast that a sensor tech has to
pass the info along.

Example-

A small low signature craft (use the same 5 ton example) Matches course with
a starship and gets with in its sensor coverage before ever trying to grapple.

They exist in the *US*. A couple of people on an SCA mailing list I get
are also Hospitallers, and there\'s a Templar or two as well!

The orders are around. Whether they are "properly" descended from the
originals or not is another matter, and one on which I am not foolish

Contrary to all the bad SF movies (and not a few bad books), the laws
of physics don\'t allow giant insects. And once you get rid of the
exoskeleton, and add lungs and a "real" circulatory system, the result
doesn\'t look anything like an insect.

Intelligent "trees" has both been overdone, and pretty well shown to be
really unlikely. Non-mobile lifeforms don\'t have any *need* for
intelligence. And intelligence requires a lot of energy, something that
photosynthetic lifeforms can\'t easily spare.

The point is that they are taking the conspiracy theory that
the Templars didn\'t disband, but instead became a secret
organization, and using it as a secret organization in
Traveller (You can\'t have an illuminate campaign if you
don\'t have any secrect conspiracies :-).

Leonard, Im foolish enougth :)

The Hospitaliers do exist, you can actually still join them.  They
maintain an Embassy in the Vatican and there Headquarters are in the
Bastion of St.John, Valletta, Malta.  

They drive around in Black jaguars with the white Cross of St.John
Emblazoned on the side of the number plates.  Which is the traditional
colour of the Tunic that the Knights wear/wore.

Now, im willing to believe that you know some hospitaliers, but Templars?
Just because someone says there a Templar, doesnt mean they are.
Templars DO NOT EXIST as an order.  

Since these two orders were both religious (Christian) orders, then the
final say comes from the Vatican.  The oldest, and only remaining order of
knighthood (by order i mean an organised group with representation) are
the Hospitaliers.  Conspiarcy or not, they dont technically exist, so i
would doubt anyone who says there a Templar, desceded from that Prussian
order.

Naturally. Although, MT rules state that the maximum agility you
can have is 6. This implies (although a bit unbelievable) that my
Imperial Star Destroyer, if designed with agility-6, is just as
maneuverable as the TIE fighters it launches.

However, in general fighters are more maneuverable than larger ships.

Are you using some specialized grappling equipment? I was assuming
you\'re simply trying to link airlocks or something similar. What
you\'re saying makes sense if you have specialized equipment for this
purpose (which most ships, I\'d argue, don\'t carry). If you do have
this stuff designed, I\'d like to see it! I\'ll probably end up 
using it in my campaign.

Not if one of the vehicles is trying to avoid exactly that sort of
maneuver. Evading such a move makes that move extremely risky.

In MT, 25000 is considered visual range. Thus, you can see it.

See above. You simply look out the window.

In starship combat, each turn is 20 minutes. That\'s plenty of time
for the pilot to react. Sorry, I don\'t own T4 yet so I don\'t know
if its turns are different.

Katherine Kurtz (of Dyrni fame) has written a book on this subject it\'s a
collection of short stories that range from the founding of the order
through modern, and maybe into the future.  I\'m not sure where my copy is,
storage I think, so I can\'t go into specifics.  The book also ties into
"the Adept" series, with one of the short stories staring Adam Sinclair.

There still exists a "Templar Order", I\'ve no idea if they have anything to
do with the original order or not.  I can\'t even remember if they claim
such ties.
I think Katherine Kurtz gives some information on them in the forward.  I
think they are some sort of charitable organization that\'s actually based
in the US.

Simply put it\'s a case of Pressure versus Vacuum.  Note that the Space
Shuttle is capable of launching other smaller space craft, as exibited by
satellites.

Think of a Sub\'s torpedo tubes.  You would have to have a simular device
for recovery of the craft for a sub to handle fighters.  About the only
thing I can think of that would handle it right now would be a Typhoon, or
possibly a Ohio class.  Even then I don\'t think they are big enough.  You
would have to totally remove the missle silo\'s, and use that space for the
launch recoverly machinery.  This modification would then most likely mean
the sub wouldn\'t be able to go as deep.

BTW we\'ve already got drones, they are called torpedoes.  Modern torpedoes
are far distant from the clockwork gadget of WWII.

Also I think the Seal\'s have some sort of Mini-sub that is deployed from
our sub\'s.  Same with the old Soviet special forces (whose name escapes
me).  Of course this could make my above stated opinions invalid.  What can
I say, I was a "blackshoe", not a "bubblehead", and always thought the
surface Navy was a better guide for Space based warfare.

Personally I think spacecraft that would be best able to handle fighters
wouldn\'t be atmosphere capable.  But there is nothing saying they couldn\'t
be built that way.

Thats intresting, so something to do with the weight of the exoskeleton i

The Templar Knights were disbanded because they had way more wealth than
was good for them.  The King of France, and others wanted to get that
wealth.  That is why they were disbanded.  The Templars were more than a
fighting order, they were also bankers and controlled much of the wealth in
Europe.

Interestingly most of the wealth supposedly disappeared along with
some/most of the order when they were shut down.

What if the target is rotating along its long axis (a typical

The target is rotating and reels the 5 ton ship in instead.  Because
of this the 5 ton ship ends up next door, but pointing the wrong
way.  The troops have to crawl onto the target and cut through (and
shoulfd they slip they go zinging off since the target is
spinning).

Evasion isn\'t the same as dodging.  Dodging does imply you know
where they other guy is, evasion tries to be random to avoid
prediction.

They can count the pores on the troops faces.

Let the computer evade/shoot/whatever (point defense does this

It\'s detected a long way before (remember that if a 5 ton ship can
get that close, for real warfare 5 ton missiles will kill
battleships).

In that I think you\'re wrong. Space warfare will resemble sub warfare more
than surface action. Run silent and if detected you\'re dead. The problem is
that Traveller space coombat and mythology is based on large fleets
clashing a la surface ships of WWII.

There\'s an ancient site open to the public in the Corridor sector I think.
An old Traveller Digest (I\'ll dig it up and post it) covered a nice
adventure there. The ultimate IMHO adventure dealing with old cryptic
books, long searches and "dungeon" crawling into an undiscovered ancient
site was Twilights Peak. It is a CT adventure and probably hard to find but
definately the best. The "Secret of the Ancients" is another CT adventure
that tells the "real" story of the ancients. Boring and shallow adventure
but interesting facts.

My early rebellion era Traveller campaign has been running on what came off
after the Twilights peak adventure for almost three years now.

The last I heard the seal didn\'t have a mini-sub the swimmer delievery
vehicle is a converted attack sub. Some spc.war and the sub fleet is the
reason behind this. Spetnaz does have them thou. That cool and cool

That depends, if your nice, leed them around for a few years, then let
them find something. Oooorrrrr,, You could let them find something right
of the bat that totally yanks them around when ever the whimm strikes 
you. (Had group of players find a teleporter that was in code and base
21, bounced them around for 10 game years with that.

We got one, too.  Docked at the quay in neighbouring New Westminster.
The current owners bought the Russian diesel boat for $100,000 (I
think) and have opened it up as a tourist attraction :)

No, they were "disbanded" (such an innocent word, to cover what happened)
by Philip II of France, in collaboration with other nobles and the Pope,
when they became too great a power in Europe, under too little control,
with too much wealth.

One could argue that the Templars survived their persecution by going
undercover (in the Hospitalers, among the Teutonic Knights, in Scotland,
and so forth) for a time and re-emerging as the Rosicrucians, the Masons,
and so forth.  And they too left a lasting testament to their beliefs --
the bank. :)  Interestingly, the best book ever written about the US
Federal Reserve system is title "Secrets of the Temple"...

There\'s no one \'creator\' on this thread...it\'s been a synergistic group
effort.  Or so it would appear, in any case.

The name could be a common slang shorthand, originating inside or outside
the group, triggered by their many similarities with the old Terran
Templars, and encouraged (perhaps consciously fostered) by their unproven
roots (among other sources) in these very Templars.

The attitude jets does NOT make the ship jiggle around and thus making it
harder to hit. It changes the ships facing and thus its maneuver drives
acceleration vector making it harder to hit. Also note that on larger ships
you\'d need quite a lot of manuever acc variation to affect hit probability
at all (see my earlier post ["Spacecombat assumptions"] with formulaes for
this).

My comment is that superconductivity in high T_c materials tends to 
break down at high currents. (Perhaps the order of 1A? Not enormous, 
anyway.)  Superconductors aren\'t necessarily the way to make a 
railgun.

Having said which, I also believe that crystalliron could be turned 
into normal iron by a couple of taps with a hammer, so maybe a little 
suspension of disbelief is called for here.

My suggestion for varying muzzle velocity is to vary the power 
applied to the dart by changing the number of power cells applied to 
it.  (Use 3 batteries, not 4, whatever.)  This is a simple 
mechanical connection problem; it could be fixed so a button press 
will select between muzzle velocities.

And the vast majority of ships use thrusters and Fusion+, and have

And where is this LS complement of water? Yes, I know that it
has to exist in order for everyone to survive, but I assume it takes 
up an insignificant amout of space on board ship, or it would have
to be accounted for in the design process. You can say that it is
part of the tonnage for staterooms/bunks/etc., but do you really 
think a ton per person of cabin space is devoted to water? Didn\'t
some of this get discussed during the great Fresher vs. Showers
Debate of \'96? <g> 

In addition, I think the part of the argument against the 1/36 chance 
of misjump has to do with the huge passenger liners that WILL NOT
exist under such a rule. How many of the Imperial Elite are going to
care to travel about when they know that odds are they will be forced
to pour their Dom Cleon \'05 into the fuel tank, along with their
perfume, lava lamps, spit, etc? Puts a whole new meaning into 
"Make sure you go to the bathroom before we get started!" <g>
And if you do use up the LS allotment, what the heck are they
supposed to use for the week in jump getting back?

Even dumping the Captain\'s fish tank and milady\'s feminine wash

jump-6 out of some Rift somewhere. And if you make some rule 
about emergency jumps needing less fuel, no one would ever make
a standard jump anymore. Why? You\'ve got a good chance of 
misjumping anyway!

Once again, this doesn\'t apply to the 99+% of ship designs that
carry fuel for ONE jump. And the [broken] economics of the 3I
doesn\'t allow any reasonable cargo or passenger ship carry fuel
for more than one jump and still make a minimal profit.

>Most of the "excitement" of misjumps should come from the

I think you\'ve hit on the crux of the matter here. IMHO this looks like
it was either a typo that slipped through (surprise <g>), or was a 
rule added to add a touch of "excitement" to travelling that 1) really
isn\'t needed (jumping from star to star isn\'t exciting enough? What
about ship board intrigue? Piracy? Hijacking? Zero-G sex?) and
2) wasn\'t though out at all about the subsequent effects on the

building if nearly 3% of them are going to misjump/disappear/explode
every 2 weeks?

Yes the Hospitallers (The Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jeruselem to give
them their full title) do still exist. With the fall of the Crusader states
they moved their base to the island of Rhodes, and acted as sort of
anti-Turkish stormtroopers. The Turks finally got more than a little peved at
this and Suleiman the Magnificent decided to do something about them. After a
rather epic seige the Turks took the island (1522), but not before the
Hospitallers had thourghly impressed the Turks and the rest of Europe (a quote
from Emperor Charles V "Nothing was as well lost as Rhodes"). The Emperor
Charles V then granted them the island of Malta as base, from where they
continued their anti-Turk activities. Naturally the Turks continued to be
peved and tried to take Malta (1565), but were defeated. In 1798 Napoleon
took the Island on his way to Egypt and the Knights moved their base to the
Vatican. By this time they had transformed themselves into the modern
charitable order of today (the Turks having become somewhat less of a threat
to Chrisendom by that time). They continue to exist as a charitable order,
running numerous hospitals and ambulance services (their speciality) through
out the world. Incidentally their headquarters (the second floor of a
building in the Vatican) is listed as the worlds smallest soveriegn state.

They feature in many of the great battles against the Turks (Lepanto 1571,
the Seige of Vienna 1683 etc.) during this period.

In 1308 King Edward II of England seized the possessions of the Knights
Templar in England and granted them to the Hospitallers. If memory serves me
right they picked up a lot more when the Templars were officially disbanded
in 1312.

Now there\'s some adventure hooks for a tired traveller umpire in there!

Well, to start with, the way drag works, a smaller vessel has problems.
Torpedoes manage by being nothing but powerplant and warhead and by
being *very* skinny (long, narrow has better drag factors).

In effect, modern wireguided torpedoes *are* remote controlled
fighters. Manned ones are out because the only *possible* rendevous and
docking procedures would let everyone for *miles* around know what was
going on.

The environment is just *too* different. You can\'t draw many (if any)
useful analogies between space and submarines.

The way I looked at it:

* if the PC is that skilled, they will usually hit what they aim for,
* failing that, the more skilled they are, the more likely they are to   
hit something (someone, somesophont, whatever).

I originally invented the rule to cover an incident where one lunatic was   
firing into a melee in a ship\'s corridor (March Harrier as it happens -   
although that\'s hardly relevant) and attempting to hit the person they   
were aiming at. In the crowd and the confusion, it seemed likely that the   
character would hit someone close to the aiming point.

In answer to your last point, assuming that the crowd includes the same   
numbers of friends and enemies, the firing character is no more or less   
likely to hit a friend as they are to hit an enemy.

However, I should say that I have had occasion to use this \'rule\' less   
than a dozen times in the last ten years or so (my gun-bunnies prefer not   
to get too close to their enemies!).

Various Kings and Princes had been suppressing the Templars for a while.
King Edward II suppressed them in 1308 in England, The Emperor had suppressed
them in Germany in 1305. The writing had been on the wall for them for quite
some time before 1312. The root cause was that they were a pan-national
group which posed a serious threat to the power of the emerging nation states.
Their wealth was only perphial, sort of the cherry that prompted their
suppression at that moment, but their time had passed and they were going
to go sooner or later. No King could allow them to exist as they were beyond
their control. It was the same thing that eventually lead to the fall of
Catholic power in northern Europe.

>Interestingly most of the wealth supposedly disappeared along with
>some/most of the order when they were shut down.

Most of the Templar\'s wealth was in the form of land, which is rather hard
to disappear with :*). Most of their liquid capital was seized by the Pope
and King of France (and various other monarchs who knew a good thing when
they saw one); but a portion of it (still a very sizable sum) did disappear
when the order was suppressed. I\'d suspect that the order did go underground
when it was suppressed, but it probably didn\'t last too long. The social
climate in Europe of that time was just not condusive to the long term
survival of such a secret order (too many powerful forces arranged against
it, too many social changes occuring). The 14th and 15th centuries mark the
death of feudal Europe and the birth of the nation state. It just wasn\'t the
right time for such a pan-national group. If the Templars had survived they
would probably have reemerged in Germany during the reformation (when the
time was right for them), but they didn\'t. Still why let probability get in
the way of a good conspiracy :*)

establishing an interstellar empire. We know that Cleon (or at least 
Artemsus) divvied the First Imperium up into domains, which was probably 
as good a way as any. 
But what would have happened with the Rule of Man? How would the 
expansion have been organised to minimise blue-on-blues? And above all, 
what would have been the best way to keep the ravening b*stards\' 
attention well away from the homeworld? 

I have a suggestion: 
Constellations. A noble house is given the rights to colonise any system 
within a particular constellation, as seen from the homeworld (Terra, in 
this case). The advantages of this: 
1. So long as the \'boundaries\' between the constellations are fairly well 
defined, there is no argument as to who owns what. In theory, at least. 
Everything becomes a lot more fuzzy the further out you get...which is 
great for the Emperor, because the Emperor wants all the fighting to 
happen out on the frontiers rather than around the homeworld. 
2. There is a very strong incentive for each noble house to expand 
*outwards*, because the \'wedge\' defined by a particular constellation 
becomes wider the further away you get from the homeworld. 
3. Some constellations will be much more valuable than others. Centaurus, 
having the nearby Centauri stars, will obviously be a plum pick of the 
constellations. Other constellations: Ursa Major, Crucis, Sagittarius, 
Orion and so on, are more or less valuable depending on how close the 
stars are to home and how much of the sky they cover. Large 
constellations may be shared or divided between smaller houses. 
4. This system gives some really nice names for nobles and their houses. The 
Barony of Crucis (Southern Cross), the Duke Sagittarius, Marquis of 
Taurus etc.

Of course, if you *weren\'t* a noble house, you could still find yourself 
somewhere to settle - a long way out. Or else you could lease the right 
to settle a system that the nobles didn\'t find particularly attractive. 
 
I suggest that this might have been the system used during the Rule of 
Man, which helps explain why the Solomani diaspora spread out so far in 
*every* direction, including towards the Rim. 

Comments? 

PS am I the only TMLer with any interest in the Rule of Man (ROM)? I 
realise this sort of places me a long way from any support in the Milieu

The problem with dividing space by constellations is the difference in
distance between stars in a particular constillation. Stars in one
constellation can be over 500 parsecs apart, their only connection is
their closeness as seen in direction from Earth. There is seldom a 
constellation where the stars actually are close enough to make up 
a domain.

I agree with your last two sentences. Attitude jets do change the ship\'s
facing. However, they can be used in combat situations to jiggle the
ship, making boarding more difficult. Sure, on larger ships you need
more jets. That\'s why larger ships have lower agilities, in general.

Probably because of the raw number of people needed currently to man systems
such as Sonar, work out firing solutions, perform maintenance, etc. What
would the roll of a small sumbarine fighter?

If it was supposed to be ASW then we have helicopters for that (and small
planes). Small fighter-subs would not be able to even approach the efficiency
of the helicopter in this role.

If the roll of the small sub-fighter is to attack surface convoys then again
it would seem to be a failure, in order to stick sufficient torpedo and
sensor systems, you would have yourself an attack sub (which may not be as
big as you are thinking, they are definately considerably smaller than
boomers).

One needs to remeber that no war can be won at sea, nor in the air, and by
extension none could be won in space. Wars are over land, and the basic unit
for land combat is the infantryman. Everything else is simply support. This
is unlikely to ever change.

All you say is very true, but the real kicker is that _even_ if you assume
that a ship carries enough fuel to make a second jump (or even that a 
misjump will always place you in a system with access to fuel) such a
misjump will place the ship somewhere far away from where they are
supposed to be with the inevetable loss of, on the average, 1/3rd of a
year\'s revenue. If you think ordinary starship economics are tough, just
imagine what a such a loss roughly once per year (a regular freighter or 
liner ought to be able to do 35 jumps per year) will do to your bottom
line.

That\'s what I thought, but IIRC someone asked Imperium Games and they

what I\'ve been told. (Joe, could you find out for sure?).

Number one: it doesn\'t have to anticipate, it simply has to be able to react
to the moves. If it can react fast enough (and a tech level 15 computer
should be able to react fast enough) then the adjustments would come
milliseconds after the evasion attempts, effectively making them
instantaneous. Since you can\'t apply instant changes to the vector of a 100s
of ton starship travelling with significant velocity along any set course
anyway, all "jiggleing" could only consist of small changes to the forward
velocity and course. Even though most space combats would occur at relatively
slow speeds (being near a planet), the forward momentum of the ship would be
far greater then any "jiggleling" that could be done with attitude jets.
Brilliant Lances actually illustrated how difficult it is to dogfight at high
vectors. Thus any docking maneouvers would still be mostly a matter of
matching vectors. The biggest problem that I see has more to do with the TNE
statement that ships are constantly spinnning about their axis, this makes
the only points readily available for docking/bording at either end of that
axis, and one end is certainly not going to be very good to board if the
maneuver drives are still putting out thrust. Thus the only point for bording
is from bow to bow. An actual dock or grapple would be difficult to
impossible on a spinning ship, unless you had some sort of mechanical grasper
that could grab the nose of the other ship (and each end would have to be
capable of spinning). Perhaps this "arm" has a corridor inside it to
facilitate the movement of troops.

Number two: even if the computer had to anticipate, the existance of programs
like Predict-1 through Predict-4 in Classic Traveller, as well as the
Anti-Hijack program show that anticipation is not beyond the high-tech
computers of Traveller.

This is not necessarily true, believe it or not. Spaceship maneuverability is
a matter of applying Gs of thrust in different directions to affect and
change vector, the greater the Gs that can be applied, the greater the
maneuverability. There is no reason a large ship cannot have large enough
drives to apply 6G, 8G, 10G or even more. This is not normally the case,
since such drives take up so much room (and surface area), and a large ship
normally needs this room for jump drives and such. The small fighter, being
purpose-built, would normally have greater maneuverability then a larger
ship, simply because there isn\'t much point in giving a carrier 12Gs worth of
thrust.

Joel continues:

No, but if you hit a spinning ship with a grapple you\'re in for a wild ride,
especially if you\'re much smaller.

<<While dangerous, jumping between vehicles is possible (Biplane to Biplane,
Truck to Truck, Boat to Boat).>>

Again, the spinning could cause probelms, making the bow the only reasonable
jump point.

<<With these variables in mind how would this modify the arguments.

Example- A small 5 ton grav driven spacecraft intercepts and matches
relative velocity with a 200 ton free trader. Using multiple grapples the

Well, in TNE both craft would be spinning, so as soon as the multiple
grapples are latched on, the small craft would be wipped into an orbit around
it. Depending on how rapidly the free trader is spinning, the grapple lines
might be snapped instantly (what material are they made of? what\'s their
tensile strength?). If the cables are strong enough, then the small craft
should be able to reel itself in. Of course, there are G forces to consider
here. It is unlikely that either craft would be spinning any faster then its
internal grav compensators could handle, since doing so would hinder the
crew.

Okay, this goes back to my original question: _assuming_ that Anders is
correct and that space combat will resemble sub combat more than surface
combat (not unreasonable, IMO), then that would seem to argue against small
manned fighters, and in favor of fairly large, slow, not-too-manueverable
vehicles (compared to a modern airplane, for example).  It might also argue
against boarding actions.  And no, I don\'t think torpedos are the
equivalent of manned fighters.

To look at this the other way, which is where I started, are there good
reasons why we don\'t have small manned submarine fighters?  Someone
mentioned that it\'d take most or all of the missile space in a boomer.  I\'m
not sure I agree with that, but even so, is there some reason beyond
military tradition why we don\'t have the submarine equivalent of an
aircraft carrier?

"Ivy League" college education

In any educational system in which homogeneity is not
rigidly enforced, some institutions will be judged as better
than others.  Prestige will accrue to these colleges, as will
money as their fame spreads: industries will wish to be associated
with a successful university, and students will pay extra in order
to study there.  This allows the college to select between a large
number of potential applicants, admit the brightest of those able to
pay the fees, and to a limited extent subsidise highly able 
scholarship
candidates from poorer backgrounds.  Its quality increases still
further, and its competition is on average poorer.

The first-rate, "Ivy League" institutions naturally attract the
highest echelons of society, leavened with highly able young people
from all walks of life.  They therefore contribute to the
stratification of Imperial society on the basis of nobility, ability,
and liquidity -- social class, intellectual and educational level,
and financial resources, in other words.  The Ivy League college
concentrates a huge fraction of the future leaders of the Imperium
under one roof, which adds enormously to the Imperium\'s cohesion
and smooth running.  It also makes the university as much a social
organisation as an educational one.

Honours:            9-; an honours graduate may apply for medical
          school, law school or (if NOTC) flight school.


Comments: The model institutions for this process are the University
of Cambridge, MIT, Heidelberg and other such. (I know less about Yale
and Harvard than I might.)  Specifically, the idea of a university
awarding only one degree is based on Cambridge\'s BA, although here
the focus is explicitly on science (whether \'hard\' or \'soft\').  The
rationale for this is the technocratic nature of the Imperium, plus
the idea that an Ivy League college is about general education and
social contact rather than learning specific skills.  The social
contact element is reflected in the Soc bonus for "low" Soc 
characters
which simulates mixing with individuals of higher social status on
a fairly level footing.  (Having said this, not fitting in makes it
more likely a character will drop out of college, hence the bonus for
high Soc on the roll for perseverance.)  OTC/NOTC might be easier for
Ivy League students, but I have not made it so.  The honours roll is
much easier than usual to simulate the much higher level of academic
achievement in such colleges. (Cambridge awards an MA on the basis of
having survived the BA, and living another 3 1/3 years afterwards, 
for example.)  Fencing skill as a social achievement is pure Heidelberg,
but fits beautifully with the Third Imperium.

Cui bono?  Ivy League colleges allow characters with Soc 9 to enter
the ranks of the nobility (+1 Soc from college = A, the minimum to
enter the Noble career), which represents the meritocratic nature of
Imperial nobility.  They also provide a disproportionate number of
doctors, lawyers and Scholars.  However, they do not teach 
performance skills at all; nor do they provide a good technical education.
These skills are acquired either indirectly, as in learning electronics
while a physics student or understanding pyschology through art,
or as hobbies, such as amateur dramatics or extra-curricular computer
work.



Law School

The art and practice of law is somewhat different from normal
graduate work.  As a result, dedicated law schools are common,
dealing with both planetary and Imperial law.  Lawyers can be
found in most Imperial services, as well as merchant organisations.

   Ooh, oo-oo-ooh!  What you want to to do is send them on the
   "Twilight\'s Peak" series of adventures (Shadows ---- Research Station
   Gamma ---- Twilight\'s Peak),  one of the best adventure series ever
   written.  Each adventure can also be played as stand-alone, if you
   can\'t get all three, but the climax is the third, "Twilight\'s Peak".

   "Secret of the Ancients" is the adventure with the most information. 
   It lays bare all of the mysteries and resolves the enigmas.  It also
   essentially puts an end to using the Ancients as an /enigmatic/ plot
   device; they become just another powerful alien race, ala the Borg,
   the Organians, or the Q continuum.

   The Japanese used small, 1-man submarines in WWII.  They were not
   generally successful.  Perhaps a military historian can tell us why.
   To get the conversation moving, let me contribute a few thoughts by
   someone who has no idea what he\'s talking about (me):

   1) Communication: The sub\'s greatest asset is its stealth.  When subs
   begin communicating with one another enough to organize into wings
   and groups (necessary for effective fighter combat) they give away
   their position.

   2) Visibility: Even when fighters are maintaining radio silence, they
   keep in formation by observing where their wingmen are, but
   underwater, you really can\'t see anything.  Again, this prevents
   effective use of group tactics by fighter subs.

   3) Logistics:  Another sub asset is the ability of the the sub to hang
   around near enemy strongholds until it sees its chance to do damage.
   Small craft simply do not have the supplies necessary for staying far
   from home for a long time.  As for rendez-vous with mother ships or
   resupply vessels, see (1) and (2) above.

   It seems I once heard something about Russian tactics for using subs
   in squadrons.  This means they have overcome obstacles (1) and (2)
   somehow.  How do they do it?  Does it work well?

I think you *could* use attitude jets to "jiggle" your ship enough to make
boarding difficult.  Suppose a vessel has cluster of attitude jets at the
bow, and another cluster at the stern.  To turn the bow to starboard, you
could either fire the port-side forward jets, or the starboard-side aft
jets.  To tip the bow "down," you could fire the dorsal forward jets, or
the ventral aft jets.

If, however, you wanted your ship to "side-slip" to starboard, you could
fire BOTH the port-side forward jets, AND the port-side aft jets.

Here\'s an interesting possibility: are attitude jets mounted rigidly, in
clusters, on the hull (like the ones on the cylindrical "service module" 
of the "Apollo" spacecraft) or are they flexibly-mounted?  If attitude
jets can be "aimed," couldn\'t they also be used a *weapons*, to drive off
would-be boarders?  Presumably, the safety-interlocks that ordinarily
prevent the jets\' exhaust from scorching the ship\'s hull would have to be
turned off, but that wouldn\'t be hard.  Boarders would have to be very
careful to "land" on patches of hull far from the jets...

Actually, that\'s not why larger ships would have lower agilities.
There are 2 reasons why this would be true:

1.  G-compensation.  Changing facing rapidly involves an angular
acceleration.  The radial component, a, is: a = v^2/r.  a can
rapidly far exceed the g-compensation rating of the ship with just
little thrusters at the tips of the ship to start it spinning.

2.  Crew.  If you have a single crew member at the center of
rotation, the radial "a" term above makes little difference (since 
v = 2*Pi*r/period and period is the same regardless of the r since
the two points on the ship are attached to each other).  As a result
larger ships with more crew need to have crew members at various
places around the ship which limits them to g-comp radial
accelerations.

So what?  I can brainstorm for a couple of days to come up with a
_really_
alien race, or use something that is just as icky and alien, but very
short on
time to create:
("You see something that looks like a giant spider.. ah, it must be the

Well, a few million years ago there were dragonflys with wingspans in
excess 
of a meter -- as I understand, there is evidence that the Earth\'s
atmosphere
contained more Oxygen.  Also, what if this insectoid race _did_  have a
reasonable circulatory system?  Would you know it if you met one on the 
street (and didn\'t shoot it -- the bleeding would give it away, I
suppose).  As
for an okay stab at this, look at Star Frontiers\' Vrusk -- insectoid,
has both an 
internal and exoskeleton; has a circulatory system.

Again, the thing about aliens is that they are alien.  They might look
like 
trees and use some amount of photosynthesis, but have tools and such.
They don\'t even have to be mobile... what if the entire forest you\'ve
just crashed
your starship into is a sophont being (uses tools, fire, agriculture,
psionics, 
stonework, metals, genetics, etc.  Just not terribly interested in
spaceflight until the planet
gets more crowded.  Take that idea, and some of Niven\'s Stage Trees....)

Why does all life have to be based on our chemistry; to some methane 
breather race out there we should all be nothing more than oxidized 
compounds -- \'gentlepods, life using oxygen is unlikely because of the 
temperatures that it would have to endure\'

If you want aliens, take some concept -- pincers, echolocation, slime,
larvae,
etc. and use that as a launching point.  How about an amphibious race
that 
looks a bit like 2 meter long sea slugs (with the frilly gill on the
back).  Add 
the attitudes that  you want them to have ("DIE LAND DWELLER SCUM!" or 
"wE wOULD lIKE tO sELL yOU sOME sECONDHAND kEYBOARDS") and 
you have your alien.

So they look like a tree or a spider or a dinosaur.  Big deal.  It\'s fun
to run 
into alien races you\'ve read about in SF books, it\'s also fun to deal
with 
completely new races.  You have your own imagination, and the books
aren\'t 
printed on vellum with rare inks.  Take Traveller and mutate it.  

- --Don\'t like Asimov?  Change the Imperium, give it a number of powerful
neighbors,
make Cleon more of a scamp

- --Like Asimov a lot?  Add in Hari Seldon (I\'m sure Issac wouldn\'t mind
you doing
that this one time)

- --Like Dean Foster a lot?  Add flying lizard/dragons and other beasties.

- --Buy other stuff <<making protection from fire rune>> get a bunch of
GURPS, 
TSR Star Frontiers/Buck Rodgers, and Space Master books and STEAL STEAL
STEAL.
(personally my favorite RPG is Paul Kidd\'s Albedo Anthropomorphics--it
was to create
background for that that I originally bought my first Traveller books.
Still is.)

Worried about stats and specifics?  My problem is I concentrate on those
too much
(stats for neighboring planets that the PCs won\'t see, etc) I\'d recommed
the two sentence method: get the centeral idea down in two sentences,
the stats and other details 
will come out of that.

     The occurrence of an automobile accident, for each individual driver,
is one accident every seven years.  I think that dying in an auto
accident would be the equivalent to a Major mis-jump.  One mis-jump per
36 jumps does seem ridiculously extreme.  I\'ve always believed that not
only should an Astrogation check be made, but that an Engineering check
be made as well, equal to the Astrogation difficulty.  Just a couple
thoughts.

Besides Cris\' valid point, I have another equally important reason
(imho).

Distances based on factors of three on the high end make it easy to
calculate "time lag" since 1 light-second = approx. 300,000 km

Another point: Big jump from your range 11 to 12 (factor of 300). Rest
of the range table uses a factor of 10. There should be another range
band or two (or three) between "Far Orbit" and "Interplanetary".

Distances beyond 1 light-sec should use propogation of light as a basis.
What\'s important at these great distances is *speed of communication*.
It so happens that 1 AU approximates 500 light-seconds. 

So... Here\'s my suggestion for ranges:

 6 subregional          10 km     
 7 regional             30 km
 8 subcontinent        300 km      
 9 continent         3,000 km     
10 orbital          30,000 km   0.1 light-sec
11 far orbit       300,000 km     1 light-sec
12 satellite           3e6 km    10 light-sec
13 far satellite?      9e6 km    30 light-sec
14 interplanetary        1 AU   500 light-sec 
15 outsystem          10.8 AU   1.5 light-hour
16 deeepspace          108 AU    15 light-hour

Having satellite and far satellite range bands allows for more
granularity at typical space combat distances.

Keeping ranges for far orbit/satellite in divisions of light-seconds
would be an advantage for an advanced space combat system ala Mayday or
Brilliant Lances/Battle Rider, where 1 hex = 1 light-second.

It would be a Good Thing to allow for compatability and convertability
between the simple "range band" system and a more advanced "hex based"
system.

Others:

Tender. Refuels or repairs other craft.
Escort. Defends other craft.

I think that
Liner. Carries passengers.
is the more common designation for that particular mission in Traveller.

I am reminded of CT two-letter designators for spacecraft. I don\'t have
the list right now, but I recall other nifty missions. Maybe the
designators could be brought back? Might make for easily recognized ship
lists and missions:

Type L 400 ton Tukera class
Type T 200 ton Garu
Type S 100 ton Magellan
Type P 300 ton Templar
Type Y 200 ton Opulent

or even

L-400 Tukera
T-200 Garu
S-100 Magellan
P-300 Templar
Y-200 Opulent

I can see a player scrolling through a _Jane\'s All the Galaxy\'s
Spacecraft_ summary listing: "That T-200 Garu class looks like a size we
can afford to operate, pull up the spec\'s on it."

Maybe the jump number could follow the designator, since it\'s usually an
important criterion for narrowing the search.

"Don\'t bother checking the T1-200 Garu, we need Jump-2... Look at the
T2-200 Marco Polo..."

But this is why they expand out in wedges...you don\'t necessarily colonize
all or _any_ of the stars that make the constellation, as seen from terra,
but that is the cone of space you get to claim as yours...

other ships or space stations to fight starships there are no reason for 
them to enter atmospheres, COACC has own special ships for that. Fighters 
do not hide in to gas giants to ambush other ships re-fueling there, it is 
work for SDBs. Because fighters enemies are usually bigger ships, there 
need every edge they can get. And extra weight and lost volume don\'t help.

Fighter planes are able to go much faster than their carrier.  So they can cover
more ground, and can keep the expensive carrier away from the enemy, while
only letting cheap (relative to a carrier) planes get near the enemy.

But one manned submarines wouldn\'t be able to go any faster than a normal sub.
Due to drag and to noise restrictions.  So you don\'t have the same enhancment
of your forces, as you do with airplanes.  

That\'s what I think.

I can see that the "blackshoe" (i.e. old and out of date) Navy is still
smarting from the fact that they have been reduced to just escorting the
new AIR POWER elements. ;-)

As an ex "brownshoe" (i.e. new and more effective) I just wanted to set
the record straight.

Traveller Mode On
However, IMHO Sub war is much closer to space combat during the
detection and strategic movement phases. The opening, as it were. 
(Ships moving silently, everyone on edge as they attempt to detect the
enemy fleet or ship)

Once the detected, range closes and combat starts, it shifts to more
Battleship style combat. 
(Everyone knows where you are and you slug it out until one side has had
enough, then you have to get away)

Bob;
Ex Brownshoe and damm proud of it.
Marine, and even more proud of that.

I agree completely.  This makes scaling for different combat systems
easy, and it has a nice conversion to english descriptions since
nobody would say "There\'s a pirate ship far orbital distance from
us!"  They\'d say "There\'s a pirate ship about a light second away!"

Hear hear!

It also makes talking about ranges in english make more sense as
well as having the right feel (IMHO).

I don\'t like the lable placement, however.  I\'d say:

6  subregional      10km
7  regional         30
8  subcont./low orbital  300
9  cont./orbital    3,000
10 far orbital      30,000
11 natural sat.          300,000
12 far nat. sat.    3e6
13 dunno about the others :-)

The problem is that 30,000km is GEO for earth, and LEO is closer to
300km.

Or a tenth of a ls.  Still, a great idea.

True.  I like this best of all proposed.

back in 1984-5 when i was still a member of Her Majesties forces in Cyprus,
we had a range day at akatiri, the range there fires out over the sea, you
have an observer in a tower either side of the range watching for shipping

we had finished doing the shoot and were popping off the excess ammo when a
harrier jumpjet came across the bottom of the range at about 20-30mph and i
have to admit that along with everybody else i took a few potshots at its

across our line of fire before going into hyperdrive, i\'d love to have been
a fly on the wall of the office when the pilot tried to explain to his CO
why he had bullet holes in his fusalage, especially since you have to book
those ranges 6 months in advance, and the RED danger flags were flying, so
he couldn\'t use the excuse that he didn\'t know we were firing that day.

Well, the problem is that the starts you see in a contellation may
be separated by several hundred light-years along the depth axis,
as seen from Earth. 

I think that the RoM would have been pretty messy... lots of sub-lieutenants,
lieutenants, commanders, etc, suddenly in charge of whole systems,
gigantic highports bigger than anything Terra\'s ever built, etc. Most of
them would be scrambling to keep things running, much less worrying about 
how to divide up space.

Not at all! I\'d love to write up tons of stuff about the RoM...I think
it would be the most appealing environment to game in, for lots of reasons!
(I\'m at work though, so I can\'t expond on it right now...)

Anyways, Michael and anyone else interested in the Rule of Man, we should
talk...

Because fighters would not have the same role in submarine combat. Everything
in a military has certain roles. A jet fighter\'s primary role is air
supremecy, that is: denying airspace to enemy aircraft, specifically bombers.
Area denial is not a valid maritime role. The ocean is just too darn big.
That is why we have things like the SOSUS network to detect subs when they
cross into and out of an area. Then, if we want to deny the area to a
submarine, we have a location to start with, and we send in ASW operations.
These consist of carriers, picket ships, and most importantly; aircraft. Small
 one-man subs still would not be fast enough to function in an intercept
role, while ASW aircraft are.

This is the main reason that submarines are not a good analogy to space
combat, there is nothing in space combat that is faster than another
spaceship (other than a faster spaceship), thus fighters useful for space
combat, but sub-fighters are not useful for ASW (but air fighters are).

In the C.T. scenario book, "Trillion Credit Squadron," there *was* a
fighter with a semi-streamlined ("close structure," I believe) hull.  I
would argue that fighters *are* designed with atmospheric missions in
mind - providing support for invading troops, for example.  Fighters might
be based on sparsely populated frontier planets which lack orbital
starport facilities, too.

Right, fine.  Listen, I\'m _not_ trying to argue for adding small submarine
fighters to anyone\'s sub force.  What interests me is that if we can come
up with all these good reasons why we don\'t have such small sub fighters,
why do we think we might have small space fighters?  I think for all the
reasons I\'ve heard so far as to why we don\'t have sub fighters, most can
generalize pretty well to an argument for not having small space fighters
too.  

Are small space fighters believable, or have we all seen Star Wars too many
times?

So, what does this say about area (volume?) denial in space?  If you think

Okay, so by hand-waving (not necessarily a bad thing), we\'ve posited that
small space fighters are automatically faster than large space ships.
Given that, we return to the aircraft analogy for space fighters, since
their greater speed and agility makes them effective against ships of the
line.  

If that\'s pretty much people\'s thinking, then I have another question...
one other advantage that airplanes have over surface craft is that they can
move in 3 dimensions instead of just 2 (plus their speed, agility, etc.).
So to extend this to space combat, has anyone ever thought of creating a
small micro-jump drive (TL16+) that enables a _small_ mass (<50 tons say)
to micro-jump to another location within about 0.1 light-second distance
virtually instantaneously, and much closer to a gravitational mass than is
normally possible for jump drives?  The image of a huge battle rider
surrounded by small fighters blinking in and out to avoid return fire,
etc., is pretty cool I think.  What do you all think of this?

For the same reason we don\'t have small attack speedboats carried by 
modern large surface warships - or at least for similar reasons. Small
"subfighters" would have no speed advantage over big submarines (as 
indicated elsewhere, they might well have a speed disadvantage.) Sub-vs-sub
weapons are sufficiently faster than subs or subfighters that agility
isn\'t a factor in dodging them, so subfighters would be just as easy to hit.
Sub sensors - especially good passive sensors - are *huge*; a subfighter would
be at a major disadvantage relative to a big sub. Effective weapons are
also pretty big. A subfighter could use short-ranged torpedoes, perhaps - but
it would be bigger (including the fighter) than the same amount of long-
range torpedo, so why bother?

Some might argue that similar reasoning would indicate that space fighters
are of limited use compared to big warships, but let\'s not re-open
that particular can of Hiver larvae.

   I had a little time today to look up some stuff on the real Templars
   and Hospitallers.  Interesting stuff!  What does this have to do with
   Traveller?  Well...

   Leonard Erikson raised the possibility that the word "Solomani" had a
   latin origin.  If it did, it might have meant "Followers of Solomon". 
   Why would emperor Hiroshi refer to some followers of Solomon in his
   regency address to the Imperium?  It turns out that the real,
   original name of the Templars was "The Poor Fellow-soldiers of Christ
   and the Temple of SOLOMON"! 

   OK, all you conspiracy theorists, get to work!

   Some more factoids about the Templars:

   They eschewed pomp and did not wear uniforms. They had greater income
   and military strength than Philip IV when he suppressed them. (Why
   did they submit, then?)  To avoid enriching Philip, all of their
   properties were handed over to the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem,
   the original military order, which inspired the Templars in the first
   place.  Philip IV made up outrageous lies about heretical, secret
   ceremonies which the Templars supposedly performed.  They were
   extra-national; no secular authority had any control over them.  Many
   Templars were former heretics or criminals, doing penance for their
   sins by joining the austere order.

   It\'s no wonder that conspiracists had a field day with these guys!

   About the Hospitallers:

   There have been scads of orders of Hospitallers over the centuries,
   the most prominent, by far, being various orders of Augustinians,
   Dominicans, and Franciscans, who still run many hospitals all over
   the world.  The important military order, "the Knights of St. John of
   Jerusalem, of Rhodes, and of Malta", was founded in Jerusalem before
   the first crusade and still exists today, and (like the Templars) is
   considered a sovereign nation.  Historically, they differed from the
   Templars by admitting women into their order and allowing Jews to
   hold high-ranking staff and medical positions; they were also rather
   less militaristic, leaving some of the fighting to the Templars, to
   Russia, and to Austria.  Because they weren\'t so well armed, they
   were less likely to frighten the local monarchs, and so fared better
   than the Templars after the crusades ended.  The hospitallers
   concentrated on helping pilgrims via hospitals and shelters, whereas
   the Templars put more effort into providing escorts on the road.

   Other than these aforementioned differences, the Hospitallers and
   Templars were very similar.  This is hardly surprising, since the
   Templars patterned themselves after the Hospitallers, even adopting
   the same patron saint, St. John.  Both orders were founded in
   Jerusalem, the Hospitallers before the crusade, the Templars after
   (which helps explain their militaristic, macho bent). Both emphasized
   the importance of chivalry and nobless oblige; both reserved certain
   important ceremonial and administrative positions for pedigreed
   nobles.  (Although in both orders, the highest officers were appointed by
   the pope.)

   All of this makes excellent fodder for adventures in a lawless,
   feudal society, like the interstellar community of M0.  Don\'t
   introduce just one holy order of knights into your campaign,
   introduce several rival and complementary orders!

Heck, the very first military submarines were one-man crank-driven jobbies
used during the War of 1812 to punch holes below the waterline in British
vessels in American harbors.  This was highly experimental and
staggeringly dangerous, but they did damage a few ships this way.

Yes, that\'s the number-one limitation on sub tactics -- there\'s no way to
communicate from a sub without giving away your position.  The one partial
exception is ELF communication, but that\'s of no tactical use.

If you know your own guys\' sonar signatures, you should be able to track
them well enough to stay in formation, especially given other clues (see
below).

I think we\'re all talking in terms of an aircraft-carrier model of
operations; "fighter" subs would be carried in a larger sub between battle
deployments.  Finding, communicating with, and docking with the "carrier"
would be relatively trivial, if not in a combat/stealth situation.  If you
*are* in such a situation, though, it gets *very* hard.

A problem with the "carrier" model is that submariners hate having any
more holes in their ships than strictly necessary.  Launch and recovery
ports for something fighter-sized would be big weak points in the carrier
sub.  In general, any new sub ordnance needs to be deployable through a
standard torpedo tube (40" diameter, if memory serves), because the Navy
is utterly unwilling to cut new holes in their ships -- and I can\'t say I
blame them!

The key to understanding the old Soviet military is to see the whole thing
as a giant distributed computer program.  Individual units and their
commanders were given very little discretion in how to fight; instead, you
evaluated the tactical situation, opened the ops book to the appropriate
page, and did what it told you to do.  Thus, the Soviet sub squadrons
could work because each skipper knew what he would do if he were
commanding any of the other boats -- which is almost as good as being in
communication with them.

And it works well in the sense that everybody does what they\'re supposed
to do, on time, in the right place, in tight coordination with everyone
else.  It doesn\'t work well if (a) the enemy does something the ops book
doesn\'t mention, or (b) the enemy has read or figured out your ops book. :)

One note, is maneuverability aside, a 5 ton craft has a lot less inertia to

Okay the purpose here is not to Actually connect to an airlock, that is pure
bonus the object is to connect to the ship. 

Grapples- Well I am sort a flying on this one so far. My vision would be of
a multi function grapple, that combined magnetic and old fashioned hook
design. This would allow for a lock over most of the ships hull. As I recall
a ship is ripe with, guns, antenae and such.

As to the rolling of a Starship. This could open a whole can of worms.
- -Does the ship turn continously?
- -Why would it need to turn continously?
- -If the ship did turn continously, how does it lock on guns, or turn a
damaged side to the enemy?

It is my understanding that a ship turns on it\'s axis to bring guns/sensor
to bear, or to turn a damaged hull away from your opponent. What would be
the benifit to turning all the time? I can think of the above two reasons
not too.

See my questions regarding spinning of starships above.

Even if the ship rotated a small craft with a strong flight computer and
design could handle the stress involved in such manuevers.

Yes at 25000 klick you can see a decent sized object if its white or gray.
If the craft is black then the visibility is strictly reduced.

Also yes you can see objects out your window. But how well can you pick out
a small object in a large area, especially if you are undergoing manuevers? 
Ever tried to spot a moving car in the parking lot while on the tilt a whirl
in the midway? Sure you can see the parking lot from that hieght, but can
you pick out a distinct object.

><My Comments>

><Erwin>
>Irrelevant, if you\'re in visual range.

I disagree, even in todays modern air and navel combat, you have to know
where an enemy is before looking with your naked eye. 
The AWAC will tell you there is a target in bound at 9 o\'clock. Only now do
you have a referance to look for it visually. Even then it will be your
copilot doing the looking while you fly the plane.

Sensors are the key to space combat. If the target cannot be detected than
fighting it is so much more difficult.

>> <My Comments>
>> How capable our Starship sensor at detecting a very small craft when it is
>> less than a half klick away, a 100 yards, a 100 feet?

Two sides to this


Visual- If you are flying a C-130 cargo plane, you have the cockpit windows
and maybe a half dozen others. If a plane gets right under you, you cannot
see it, because your field of vision is resrticted. If the Loadmaster yelss
out tat he sees the target, the pilot still must react.
(While I know it is pure fiction, who here saw the movie Executive decision?
There a plane connected with another without ever being spotted. Granted in
that case the pilots did not even know they were a target.)

Electronic-
In todays electronic battlefield, you run into the concept of clutter all
the time. If you were on the USS Enterprise at night, how would the bridge
know that there was a 20 foot boat 10 feet of the port? Wait I\'ll answer
that, a crewman would see it from the main deck. However if no one was on
deck there are no sensor to let you know its there.

Yes a turn is 20 minutes, that gives both pilots plenty of time to react.
Two edged sword.

Point Defense falls into the next comments.

A missile moving at 6G+ on a glowing trail of propulsion exhaust is darn
easy to spot. 
Compare that to a grav driven, radar absorbing hull, low EM signature craft.

I would attest that today an F-117 at night could get with in 20 feet of a
C-130, even if the C-130 knew it was out there and trying to get close.
When you move to the world of Starships, zero-g, armored hulls etc. That
"F-117" could not only get with in 20 feet of the "Cargo Plane", it could
potentially lock on.

Again, thanks so much for the feedback. You have all brought up great points
that are helping greatly to enhance my concept.

The Russians use subs in pairs. Generally for the advantage of one moving at

Fighters may be employed against surface targets, however, and for that they
would need to be AF. Remember that any warfleet\'s goal is going to be surface
bombardment, or at least interdiction, and if they have nothing they can land
then they are pretty useless.

Agreed!

For spaceship movement (and space combat) I use 2 scales:

Combat/Detailed  - .1 light-second (~30km)

Movement/General -  1 light-second (~300km)

It seems lately every time I post it\'s to present how what I do is
different, and I feel a rant coming on.  Would you allow me a little rant,
please?

I haven\'t participated much in this particular discussion, because my games
are very different from \'canon\' and will continue to be different from
whatever the new \'canon\' turns out to be!  For example, in my universe, the
normal in-system propulsion method is the Stutterjump Drive.  Pseudo-speeds
for ships range from below 2Mk to a little above 20Mk per hour, and we
measure their movement in ls (light-seconds) and dls (deci-light-seconds). 
Combat turns are 1 minute, and effective ranges top out at about 3ls
(900,000k).  FTL is jump with many of the standard Traveller features and
limitations, but when you get down to the details there are some major
differences.

The *feel* and general background of the games I run is close to standard
Traveller.  It\'s this *feel* that I define as Traveller, I\'ve run games in
the Imperium ficton, but I\'ve also run games in a number of variants of
that ficton, additionally I\'m running a game in a variant of the Trek
ficton, and am considering running one in a variant of the "Space 1889"
ficton, and in all these games I consider myself running Traveller!  It\'s
not a specific plot, history, or even technologies that makes Traveller..at
least not to me.

After reading Marc\'s and Joe\'s posts about the coming "Traveller
Deluxe"..T5.., I sat back and considered just how different the mechanics
of my games are from the *published* rules.  Much of my technology is
different.  Character Generation is different, and so are tasks.  Combat is
*very* different.  I generate planetary
systems differently.  Virtually every rule I use is a house rule. In most
cases the backstories are only similar, sometimes completely different. 
I\'d *really* like the ship/equipment/weapons design sequences to be able to
produce stuff that will work in my games, but they never have, and I\'ve
just about given up hope on that.

Lots of folks want vectored STL movement, I don\'t.  Lot\'s of people think
space combat should be "dogfights in space", I don\'t.  Other folks,
probably think boarding and prize taking is over the top space opera...well
maybe it is, but I want it anyway.  Some people want to set their games in
a "shared" universe, I want to create my own...so who\'s stopping me? 
Nobody!  However, I\'d *like* TRAVELLER to make it easy for any of me..for
any of us..to build our own universes with varied technologies,
assumptions, and backgrounds. Vain hope?  I\'m afraid so!

Last spring, I decided to spend the summer turning TNE/2300/Tw2k/FFS into a
unified system that would work in my kind of universe, then I heard about
T4 and waited to see if it would make all that work unnecessary.  It
didn\'t!

It\'s a year later, and I\'m back to creating my own system.  There are a
number of things in T4 I\'ll use, but I\'ll be pulling from *all* the other
sources too, and this time I\'m not waiting for T5. I\'ll buy it, and
shamelessly steal anything good from it, but I\'m not waiting anymore!

Ok, rant mode off.

Now, don\'t think I\'m preparing to disappear.  In my mind, I\'m really still
playing Traveller even if it only bares a passing resemblance to what the
\'canonists\' play.  <g>

I only know the history of templars as it crossed paths with the

The hospitaliers appreciated the gesture, and it was a substantial amount
(counting all the estates etc) but it didnt match there wealth, so unless
a hell of a lot of these monies disapeared, i would dispute they were the
wealthest order.

The Hospitaliers were pirates/police after they were ejected from
jerusalem, they maintained fleets as well as various Island fortress\'.
They also had estates and castles throughout christendom.   This seems to
imply a huge amount of wealth.   

So, if the only reason the french king (though i was sure it was the
spanish king, Phillip, not the french king) wanted to disband an order
because they wanted there wealth, why didnt they disband the
Hosipataliers?

Concurrently, why was most of the Templars holdings then handed over to
the Hospitaliers?  This doesnt make sense with your supposition of "they
wanted there wealth".

Also, both orders swore allegience to the Pope, and recognised no other
authority outside there own orginisations except for the Pope, so the king
of france can want all he likes, its the Pope who had the final say.

Besides this though, i dont know enougth about the Templars to argue
anything about them with any authority.  Im just comparing what you said
with what i know.  I think this is way off topic for the list, so i\'ll
stop ranting now.

1) Self-contained life-support habitats

4) Communication problems/lags require a high degree of 
autonomy
5) Both operate in a 3-D environment (though Traveller less so <g>)
6) Both conduct combat at non-visual ranges (if the Captains are 
smart) and nearly entirely via sensors of some sort

And that\'s what I can come up with just off the top of my head...

I had missed that point as well! You realize that this means most ship
owners will probably become "skippers" through no fault of their own; the
first THUDDD competition proved just how hard it is to make a profit under
*normal* circumstances...

If this rule is allowed to stand, I think Pan-Imperia may get out of the 
commercial ship business and start building bounty-hunters! <g>

In the MegaTraveller combat rules, both personal and ship-to-ship, they

pinpoint targeting, and if you miss the exceptional success, but still hit,
it hits as normal.  Why would anyone NOT attempt a pinpoint on every shot?

Also, is a version of the errata for MT available online somewhere?

You can send it to me, id like to see it.  Wish i knew about this, as i
already went to teh effort of creating one.  Im working on Traveller
plugin for a game, and as such, im working my way through the starship
manual and converting each ship into a lightwave object for rendering.

If anyone else has any traveller 3d objects, id appreciate them (i\'ll

The Japanese did indeed field one man submarines during the Second World
War but only to marginal effect, as detailed below.  Indeed, the Japanese
mini-subs (called kaiten) were *kamikaze* submarines.  And thus their
utility for player characters seems marginal to this author.

The effectiveness of the kaiten program is stated in a quote from Kamikaze
Submarine (subtitled "I was a human torpedo!"  The Fantastic Story of
Japan\'s Submarine Kamikazes) by Petty Officer Yutaka Yokota of the Imperial
Japanese Navy with Joseph D. Harrington.

"When World War II clsoed, the Japanese thought they had sunk some 40
Allied ships, including a British cruiser of the Leander class, through
their kaiten effort.  A check of all available respources reveals they sank
only two U.S. Navy ships, the tanker Mississinewa...and the destroyer
Underhill.  This ship was actually sunk by friendly (allied) forces on July
24, 1945, after being hit by a kaiten.  Only one U.S. merchant ship, SS
Canada Victory, was the victim of a kaiten, going down on April 27, 1945.
These three vessels, measured against the eight (regular) submarines (lost
deploying or testing the kaiten) and nearly 900 Japanese lives lost in the
kaiten program, make the enemy\'s sacrifice seem fruitless."

"Kamikaze Submarine" also states that the kaiten were 54 feet long and
carried a 3,000 pound high explosive warhead in its nose.  It was guided to
a direct hit (hypothetically) by a human pilot who\'d die in the blast.
Humans were used to provide more accurate guidance systems than available
in the 1940s, but the technology of the kaiten was not adequate and many
died in the testing phase of the device.

Its the British High Command in wwII all over again.

The only reason you wouldnt have Fighters in space is because of shields.
Shields can keep the little pee shooters away long enougth for each one to
be targeted and destryoed, thats why fighters dont exist in the Star Trek
world.  The smallest effective fighting ship was the Klingon Bird Of Prey,
and it would take 3 or 4 to evenly match the old Enterprise.

Now, in the REAL world (or a world like Traveller which is realistic  enougth)
The Fighter is a Highly effective strike weapon.  They can out maneuver
any large frontline ship, they can zoom in and target important systems
(engines, gun bays, the bridge) and if you have enougth of them, no ship,
no matter how much ant-aircraft they have, will be able to cope.

Add to this the fact that each fighter has Canons and, maybe even bombs
which it can hit the vessel with.  Remember, there are no shields, so each
bullet/laser/bomb does as much damage as if they came from an equally
large vessel.  Multiply this power by 50 times, or a hundred times (1 for
each fighter) and you have an effective, nigh, invincible weapon.  The
only defense is, you guessed it, fighters.

Since the invention of seabourne aircraft, the battleship has become an
auxilary weapon, and the dreadnaught is extinct.  The battleships value
lies in its ability to shore bombard, whos value is questionable as
opposed to massed air strikes.  Everything below the Battleship has been
relegated to protecting the Carrier.

So, in a world where you have large space vessels, who can be most easily
compared to seaships AND no shields (in the star trek sense) the fighter
is king :)

WHich is what i never liked about Starwars.  Each side had shields, which,
unless they were pathetically weak would make X-wings and Tie-Fighters
pretty useless.

My 2c  comments welcome.

No compromise, no regrets.

I like this idea.  Asimov had something similiar (but not exactly the
same) in Foundation.  In the late stages of the Foundation they were at
war with some larger, but not as advanced power.

Half the foundations fleet turned up for a final battle, as the more
numerous enemy advanced, the Foundation fleet slowly withdrew.  At a
predcribed time, the rest of the foundation fleet (mostly fighter class
ships) jumped into the combat amidst the larger enemy fleet where they
proceded to attack and cause chaos, as the main Foundation fleet also
engaged.

Ill-supplied, one shot weapons.  If im not mistaken, these one man subs
were "bicycle" powered, so there range was practically zero.

Does the term "Wolf Pack" ring a bell?  German U-Boats alway worked in
teams called wolf packs.  A wolf pack was about 7 ships large.  They would
disperse and leave about a 20 km gap between each of them.  Once a target
had been spotted the point sub would radio the rest of the pack, and they
would converge on there victim.  If the Convoy was a large one they may
even call in another wolf pack.  Once they had converged they would retain
radio silence and shadow the convoy untill it was dark.  They would then
surface and attack (old subs had to surface to attack).

Here is a prime example of "squadrons" of subs, which worked effectively.

Also, the giving away position by radioing wasnt a problem in wwII,
because they couldnt trianglete the subs position, nor could they crack
the
code quick enougth to stop the attack.  Also, in wwII once a pack
converged they didnt care much if there position was given away, because,
unless the convoy had ASW, they couldnt do jack.

You know it just hit me, and considering I was involved in ASW for the last
three years I should thought of it earlier.  Noise!  A sub\'s greatest asset
is stealth, and it\'s greatest enemy is noise!

I\'m fairly sure the launch/recovery gear would make a lot of noise.

Here is another reason.  Cost.  Any idea what a sub cost\'s compared to an
SH-60B or two?  Neither do I, but the choppers are cheaper by quite a lot.
In fact a Oliver Hazard Perry, which can hold 2 SH-60B\'s (3 if you left one
on deck), and is an ASW platform itself is considerably cheaper than a
Submarine.  That being said, the OHP might get the sub, but my money would
be on the sub.  But if you replace the frigate and helicopters with a
squadron of S-3B\'s launched from a carrier....

seems to fit for space combat. Small one crew ship can do 6gs and carry a
little fuel, Big, many crew ship can do 6gs and carry lots of fuel. What
advantage does the little ship have over the big one? Assume that little
ship\'s manuver drive is based on different technology, like wet navy vs
aircraft, and you give the little guy back his advantage. Could we place an
upper limit on what maximum displacement a thruster plate can shove around,
forcing bigger ships to use Heplar and make the little fighters scoot around
on more flexiable T-plates. 
Gives the little guy some reason to give up all that armor and extra weapons
to get a real manuverablity advantage.

The point about "less militaristic" can you give a date?  SInce the
Hospitaliers have a history of nearly a 1000 years, i think its important
to give a date.  From there times in Rhodes to the Battle of Lepanto, the
Hospitaliers were the most feared christian seamen/warriors in europe.

I dont know how many accounts ive read of single galleys (generally
housing 27 Knights) taking on and defeating 3 or more Moslem galleys. Each
moslem galley contained aproxiametely 100 Mean-at-arms. 

The highest count i have ever heard was of a british knight who with one
galley, and 3 previously captured moslem galleys, intercepted and
destroyed or captured a moslem pirate fleet heading for italy of 17
vessels.  He returned to rhodes with a fleet of 13 ships.

This is not so for the Hospitaliers.  The order had seven langues, each
langue had a Master Knight who sat on the council, the Council would vote
for the Grandmaster of the Order.  The Grandmaster served in the position
his entire life.

OOoops! My mistake! In BL/BR 1 hex does indead equal 0.1 light-second. 
Typo. As you indicate, the principle stays the same.

Thanks for your support. I hope Marc sees the advantages and incorporates

Despite your paragraph below, I\'m going to go ahead and ask the question:
doesn\'t it seem like there\'s a pretty straightforward analogy to space
vehicles along each of the lines you mention: speed, weapon power, and
sensor capabilities?  Do small space fighters _really_ make any sense?

Ewww.  That\'s what I was trying to do -- rather, I was hoping for some good
discussion, not (ugh) larvae in any form. :-)

I don\'t think that it works astrographically.  The stars in a constellation may be very, 
very far removed from one another.  Space is three dimensional, not two, so although 
stars in a constellation may appear close together from here, they may actually be very

I learned fencing at a Quaker "ivy" college, where I was also a German tutor.
One job interviewer, seeing these items on my resume, looked carefully at my

straight face that the Quaker tradition required us to wear masks when

     The stress ain\'t the whole problem, it\'s the relative masses. Go tie a

But to make a 100,000 ton carrier perform at an upper limit of 6g
acceleration would cost a hell of a lot more than to make a small 6g
fighter.  Also, space (someone correct me if im wrong) is not a complete
vacuem, therfore larger ships face more resistence then smaller fighters.

Also, i would assume that a fighter could get to its top speed a whole lot
faster than a large ship.

     You may be able to have more thrust in a straight direction, but I
guarantee a small fighter can apply those Gs in different directions MUCH
quicker. Centrifugal effects will either smear crews at the ends of the
large ship, or inertial effects will strain the hull, or the maneuvering
thrusters won\'t be able to impart enough torque, or (on and on).

     Actually, your attitude jet SHOULD be able to make you jiggle around. In
order for them to be able to ROTATE you properly, they should be paired,
otherwise you won\'t get just a rotational effect--see the diagram

   1                   2

     Normally, to rotate clockwise, you\'d fire thrusters 2 and 3. If you fire
only one, say #2, the net effect is BOTH a clockwise torque AND a downward
force. Simple mechanics.

     If I fire thrusters 1 and 2, however, I move down. Now I set up a random
sequence of firings from paired thrusters ... you\'d better be VERY careful
trying to dock, depending on the power of those thrusters.

     And even if I don\'t move laterally, see how you like it when I rotate my
ship like a club and smash your boarding party/vessel as they approach.

I think that this approach makes sense no matter whether we visualize a common law or 
civil law paradigm for the Imperium (I assume that the Vilani model will be analogous to 
civil law as practiced in Japan).

Lawyers can of course also be found working in law firms and as sole practitioners.

I don\'t see why anyone with a 4-year degree should be prohibited from applying to law 
school.  Certainly there are USNA ans USMA alumni in law school now.  Another wrinkle to 
add is sending a military officer through law school; afterwards, he or she must go into 
that branch\'s legal department (called in the U.S. services the Judge Advocate General 
department).

I totally agree with the +DM based on End; I certainly needed it.

That\'s not a bad summary.  I\'m not sure that Criminology would be available in law 
schools, but I need to check the skills list to see what it does.

You could do it that way.  In the U.S., you get a J.D. (Juris Doctor) as your first law 
degree, followed by the LL.M. as your second law degree -- but law is the only academic 
discipline to give the doctorate before the master\'s.  I would do it this way:

On graduation, receive law degree (type depends on law school attended and course of 
study).
To pass bar exam for bar below Imperial level, roll 9+; DM +1 if Int 9+; DM +1 if Edu 
9+; DM +1 if you took a bar review course (Cr2000)
To pass bar exam for admission to Imperial bar, roll 11+; DM+1 if Int 9+; DM +1 if Edu 
9+; DM +1 if you took a bar review course (Cr5000)

We could also write a character generation for lawyers.  I did one for CT a million 
years ago, but doubt that I have it.  I\'ll try to take a crack at it soon, if anyone is 
interested.

Sound problems with docking/launching operations and the already mentioned
problem with the square/cube-law ie the smaller a vehicle is the more power
per volume is required to reach the same speed given that the shape is the
same.

All this assumes the sub is supposed to be used as an archaic colw war
boomer. We Sedes have had the dubious pleasure of being visited from time
to tile by russioan minisubs that spy on our military installations.
They\'re launched from larger subs and after mission comleated they return
to their mothership. We have so far failed to catch any of them except the
large sub that drove up onto land some years ago to the embarassment of the
russians and even more so to our navy as this happened in a military zone
and the ones discovering the sub were some fishermen.

There are no attitude jets I think but rather attitude thrusterplates
inside the hull. Or one can use gyros as was tested on the US space station
they later dropped into the atmoshere.

All the above is true but there\'s a third reason that also affect the ships
max acceleration. The structure components volume in MT, T4 and GURPS is
proportional to surface area which is entirely wrong, linear would be
better but actually the structure component should be proportional to
volume^1.5 given density is fixed.
The reason for this is: Material strength is proportional to cross
sectional area while mass is proportional to volume. There it is, the
inverse square cube law that makes it harder to make large high G ships
than small high G ships. This is also the reason why you cannot build
infinitely high scyscrapers.

That\'s a risk. However, the space combat rules I\'ve seen (not T4 yet)
have no concept of a "side" that you can\'t hit. If I\'m firing on
you and hit that pesky laser turret, you can\'t claim that it was
on the other side of the ship. There is a difference here between
"reality" and the combat rules.

Yes. In MT, you automatically have a sensor lock on anything in 
visual range. This means that the sensors have already pinpointed it
for you. You need only look out the window in the direction the
sensors are indicating and you\'ll see it.

this scheme? Because it\'s already published or what?

Lets do!
One reason for fighters in space is that they can get much closer to the
enemy without being detected and also they can carry sensors and scout
ahead of the expensive spinal ships.

The reason I think is for the fighters to match the artist illustration
(invariably space fighters look like US Fighterplanes, the exception being
one of the Alien modules where they used a Swedish Viggen but erased the
fin. The worst one was in an earlier Challenge where they used a F-15
without wings exactly ;)

Fighters should be spherical for best turning (attitude) ability and also
as you don\'t know from where you\'ll be hit might as well have equal armor
all round.

Anology: You communicate through snailmail on Traveller and some letter

How about POVray?  I\'ve no idea what is available for editors now day\'s, I
havn\'t played with it for about four years.  Back then there was a fairly
good one, so I would assume there ought to be one or two editors that are
usable.
Of course this was all DOS based back then.  Back then the output was
really good, but it might take days to render an image.  I\'ve no idea how
it compares now.

Personally I\'d recommend getting a commercial package, but then they tend
to cost big bucks.  I\'m using Infini-D on the Mac, but it\'s also available
for Win95.

In the Navy it\'s because the Airdales don\'t know how to put together a
proper uniform.  Something about being afraid of black streaks on their
precious aircraft.  These aircraft, based on how clean a flightdeck has to
be, would probably crash if they had to use a normal runway.

Um, wouldn\'t this still take a weeks time in jump space?

This same trick was used in a series of six books that came out about 1980.
The series was called "Flash Gordon", but aside from the names of the main
three characters had nothing to do with Flash Gordon.  They got their hands
on this Huge Dreadnaught type ship that kept poping in and out of the
battle wreaking havoc!  It\'s actually a good series, and is a favorite of
mine.

Yes, but to make the comparison fair, you really must compare one
100,000t ship to two-thousand 50t fighters (ie: 50t x 2,000=3D100,000t).
The total cost for all those small 6G maneuver drives is about the
same as a single 6G maneuver drive aboard a lone vessel, as per QSDS.

By an *inconsequential* amount.  Were talking one or two molecules of
hydrogen per cubic centimetre... not nearly enough to cause any
noticeable deceleration in the time frame of such a scenario (or
probably even the lifetime of the ship :)

There is no "top speed" in a vacuum, until you reach relativistic
velocities, since there is no drag involved (see above).

Sigh. I\'m never allowed to forget it...Unfortunately, \'canon\' also gives 
us a 2-dimensional galaxy. There are a hell of a lot more stars within a 
few dozen parsecs than my Traveller map of the Solomani Rim suggests.

Yes, some of the other TMLers have made the same point. This is what I 
tried to bring in with discussion of the \'value\' of various 
constellations, eg Centaurus being valuable, others less so. And a 
\'constellation\' would not be limited to only the stars 
generally considered to belong, but other odd stars adjacent. 
The idea is to carve up the *entire galaxy* after all, not just some 
parts of it. Think about the Portugese and the Spanish - they divided the 
world in half, just chopped it right down the middle. 
The concept is of allotting \'wedges\' of space to various 
exploration/exploitation interests; these wedges are probably best marked 
off as constellations. Of course, the \'owners\' are then going to 
subdivide their own territory and flog off the useless bits...

Depends on the universe.  Star Fleet Battles has had fighters since

It\'s kinda hard to "zoom in and target important systems" in the
Traveller universe.  Since you are dealing with weapons that target
and engage at the speed of light, anything within a light second is
subject to being destroyed with remarkable ease.

To get that close, you would probably have to overwhelm the target
with *more* fighter tonnage than that of the target.  It would then be
unfair to compare 40 50t fighters to a lone 1,000t escort, either in
cost or combat effectiveness.

Capital ships don\'t just defend with offensive weaponry (ie: point
defence laser fire you consider anti-aircraft).  Active and passive
defences such as sandcasters and screens are also at their disposal--
defences that fighters usually lack.  Larger ships are also usually
more heavily armoured, with redundant back-ups.  The Frozen Watch can
also be used to quickly replace losses on a capital ship, while a
fighter without a pilot is pretty much out of the combat.

Additionally, it is hard to find pilots willing to go into a situation
where there is an extremely high likelihood of them being killed.  By
overwhelming the target, you are doing so knowing that many of your
pilots won\'t be coming back.  With both sides being *equally matched*,
morale is probably higher on the capital ship.

You seem to be forgetting that a large capital ship could have about
50 times (or 100 times) as many weapons as a single fighter, levelling
the playing field once again (well, maybe not perfectly level :)

My arguments is based on combat between fighters and capital ships,
where the total tonnage (or cost) on either side is the same.  If you
want to compare huge hoards of fighters fighting lone targets, you
could just as easily replace the fighters with a lesser number of
smaller ships.  If they out-mass their opponent, they probably will
win.

Actually, the entire Japanese use of submarines was quite ineffective =

    'body' => 'WW2 minisubs: the British had 2-man mini-subs, which I think were 
transportation for scuba-equipped divers as much as anything else.  
They made a real mess of the Italian navy on one occasion; perhaps 
the subs were a self-propelled explosive charge placed by the divers. 
I think this was at Taranto in 1941-2, but I could be very wrong.  
This argues for a Traveller minisub as being a manned stealth 
missile, which is an expensive alternative to a remote-controlled 
torpedo.

Space fighters: these do suffer from the same problems as mini-subs 
would in at least one respect, namely sensors.  I played with QSDS to 
see what a TL11 100-ton fighter would be like, and the answer was 
"expensive or blind" (roughly speaking).  Military grade sensors 
are too expensive and too big for 100 T_d ships, and hence for 
smaller ones at TL 11-12.  Thus, tight-beam commo from a 
fighter-control ship is needed, which is much easier than sub to sub 
communication but still a hassle.  Or you just have to let the 
fighters go, and wait for the radio to be jammed.

Spaceship physics: I once did some calculations on ship shape and 
size and how they would affect maneuverability (i.e. rate of change 
of orientation).  All things being equal, a needle design can turn 
faster for a given thrust, because it can place the thrusters further 
apart and thus generate a higher torque than e.g. a sphere.  This
effect is improved when the denser ship components are placed near 
the ship\'s centre of mass, shifting fuel and accommodation to the 
fringes of the ship (less dense).  Teardrop-shaped ships worked quite 
well, as I recall.  I think it also reduces the centrifugal force on 
the crew to have them nearer the centre of mass; correct me if I\'m 
wrong. (Need I ask on TML?)

This is substantially correct, although I should point out that 
larger ships need proportionally less thrust per m^3 to rotate at a 
given angular velocity than small ones.  Quite what the effect of 
inertial compensation would be on the centrifugal effect problem I\'m 
not sure, but it might well alleviate it for all but the largest 
ships.  (And since the G-compensation threshold increases with TL, so 
does the size of the largest agile warship.  Sylean TL 11-12 had 90 
kton battleships; late 3rd Imperium had 500 kton ships.  Hmmm.)
Have to do some more sums.

Once the T4 design formats settle down a bit, and the T4 FF&S is 
published, I might go back to some of this.  Thanks Dave for 
reminding me about centrifugal effects...

Thanks for the kind comments, Glenn. (Especially for the Ivy League

I figured that many of these would be tied to planetary law, or

Simply because the current generation tables didn\'t allow much scope 
for a lawyer in the military.  I would expect Marine legal affairs to 
be handled by the navy, like Marine medical officers are provided by 
the navy. (That\'s the Imperial ones, don\'t ask me about the USMC.)

Off-topic a little, it\'s possible to do USNA to second degree (on a 
scholarship) to medical school, \'cause I know someone who has.
(There\'s an engineering degree associated with the gent\'s past, I 
believe -- I met him when he was studying chemistry with me.)
This is equivalent to Naval Academy (or college NOTC) to MA to 
Medical School, to IN Medical branch I assume.

In the UK, Law is available as an undergraduate degree (3 years)
plus a year\'s Law Practice course (LPC) to qualify as a solicitor.
Postgraduate equivalents are 2 years.  There is also a probationary 
period in service.

I was trying to avoid creating a whole new career, but perhaps we 
need one.  Or would a general bureaucrat with Law as a possible skill 
be sufficient?  (Lawyers would be bureaucrats, just like civilian 
doctors are treated as scholars, but not all bureaucrats would be 
lawyers.)  With Imperial law so loose, and local laws so varied, I\'m 
sure most lawyers would be NPCs anyway.

If they are mobile, they won\'t look much like a tree....

18 inches long. And that was a limit because nowhere in the body can be
more than one or two cm from the outside due to the way insects
breathe.

Spiders aren\'t insects. :-)

And "insectoid" races can be justified with some work. It\'s just being
lazy to make them a "hive mind". 

Herbivore descended aliens are old hat, but the K\'Kree, Puppeteers, and
Fithp are all *very* deifferent races. The K\'Kree are a good design
because they don\'t act like the stereotypical "vegetarian alien" and
they do so for good reason.

Well, it\'d be built rather oddly for an insect. Because it\'d need
"lungs", and a lot "blood" flowing thru various joints, the joints
would need to be a lot bigger. And the head/thorax/abdomen divisions
would need to change in some major ways. On a real insect, all that has
to go thru those are nerve fibers, and a small tube that\'s part of the
digestive tract. Add in the effects of the square/cube law, and it\'d be
very hard to get an "insect". Spiders and scorpions are arthropods and
have a more advanced anatomy. They scale up somewhat better.

Form follows funtion. If they are mobile, they won\'t look like trees.
If they are immobile, then they aren\'t likely to be intelligent (as in
it takes a *lot* of handwaving to justify it).

*How* do it "use" these things. And how could an immobile intelligence
evolve? Untill it got *very* intelligent, it\'d be nothing but a drain
on the resources, returning nothing. For a *mobile* lifeform you can
justify *incremental* growth of intelligence, as it does something
useful at every stage.

It doesn\'t. But it *does* have to live on planets made of the elements
available. That kills a lot of the alternatives right there. Chlorine
and fluorine may be as active as oxygen (if not more so!) but they
aren\'t common enough to base a planetary ecology on unless it\'s a
*very* exceptional planet (as in maybe one in all of the "known space"
map. This is due to the laws of physics and chemistry. 

So even if such a planet evolved intelligent life, they\'d find a galaxy
*far* more hostile than what we see. Think of how we would look at the
stars and star travel if it was a virtual certainty that there couldn\'t
be more than a dozen worlds that *might* be terraformable in the entire
galaxy (ie it\'d be an average of 10,000 parsecs or so between them).

And they\'d have a lot harder time replenishing life support supplies
than we would even on "uninhabitable" worlds.

Methane breathers are possible, but now that we have a better idea of
just how *much* there is in Jupiter and Saturn, things don\'yt look as
good as they did (*way* too much hydrogen). Neptune and Uranus still
look ok, except that its *really* cold out there, which slows things
down a lot.

In any case, we would have nothing in common with methane breathers. We
don\'t want the same kind of planets, heck, we don\'t even want the same
*temperature range*. So aside for negotiating some "rules of the road
for the occasions when we both have spaceships near each other, and
argreements about skimming for fuel on each other\'s planets only
scientists would be interested, and not a lot of them.

My basic goal is to not have someone be able to punch a hole in my
alien/planet/whatever design just because I overlooked something about
the way the universe works.

It\'s also a three-year program, as opposed to the two years in the proposal.

And do you actually know any American nationals who have gotten an LL.M.
since, say, 1950?  The LL.M. thing appears to be a holdover from when the law
degree was an LL.B.  Then law schools decided that wasn\'t prestigious enough,
and renamed the basic law degree a J.D.  Now, the only people who get LL.M.s --
at least here at Michigan -- are foreign attorneys who take a one-year program
so they know US law as well.  (Looking through our faculty list, the only
LL.M.s appear to be emeriti, the oldest of the American profs, and foreign
nationals.)

I agree with the Endurance DM, too.  Might add an "Honors"-type option called
"Law Review;" no skill benefit, and it pushes the End requirement up by one.

Am I right?

Since I needed a 600dton hull with large armor value I designed
the hull using an old version of SSDS I got from the TML-list.
The values seems okay so thats no problem, put I have a question
about the armor value. I gave the hull an armor value of 250 (I 
think this is the FF&S value). To convert this to T4-values one 
uses the conversion chart which give 7 and multiplies this by

Small space fighters have none of the disadvantages small sub fighters do.

They can be made to be much faster then the carriers, their signature is much
smaller (rather then being noisier as in subs), and they can actually mount
weapons that would make a difference.

Nice to see that many people out there in TML land understand the tactical 
advantages of fighter swarms against large ships.  Indeed, i have seen many 
a stout frigate and destroyer come down to its knees because it was dogpiled 
on by fighter swarms.  This si why Cleon build the bloody things!  You don\'t 
become emperor by beging an enept tactician!  I just wish now Zhuhansu 
Industries could miniturize the j-drives so that we could jump the lil guys 
to the target, till then I guess we just have to rely on Assault Scouts and 
Fighter Carriers.

Fighters are wonderfull, but there\'s maybe 2 things to defend yourself with 
against fighters, more fighters(your own of course) and point defence 
systems like the ever so loved sandcaster, ever see a fighter do a 6G turn 
into a cloud of sand?  Its not pretty.  Tends to bung up the sensor arays 
and the optics on the laser, if not frag the thing, mind you fighters are 
rather tough.

They Boys in X-TEK r&d have come up with some new PD systems, basicaly we 
taken tank weapons and put them on a ship mount, range is limmited to 
Boarding (hex 0 or Point blank) but when fighters get that close....heh....

Also I\'ve noticed a major thread on boarding actions, a lot of you are 
discussing what to do if the ship is moving and evading.  I wouldnt worry 
too much \'bout that.  If the pilots worth his salt he can compensate, if the 
gunner is worth his salt he\'d knock out the danged drives.  What the little 
boarding launch should worry about is those danged point defence systems i 
mentioned ealier.  What are you poeple doing?  Launching your away team in 
the midst of combat?  Are ye daft?  The Imperial NAvy put a lot of time and 
lives into creating a wonderful system of dealing with pirates, smugglers 
and just plain scum.  Knock out the drives, blow off the weapon systems, 
inclunding the sandcasters, THEN launch the boarding team.  By that time the 
ship will have no defensive capability and will be drifiting.  Don\'t wory 
about degrading your \'prize\'.  The engineering crew can repair the systems 
later.

While your at it, might want to disable the j-dirve too, I\'ve seen despirate 
scum punch the j-drive right as the boarding team latched on to the hull. 
 That was NOT a plesant site to behold.

Okaaaay, but then why isn\'t this true in submarine warfare?  688s and
boomers are expensive, so why not lead with small stealthed mini-subs
towing passive arrays, for example?  These could put out a wide sensor net
and/or deliver decoys, mines, or torpedos from many different locations.
This would seem to greatly enhance the sensing capabilities of the big sub,
increase its effective offensive capabilities, and make detection of the
big sub almost impossible.

Again, the logic seems to hold for both subs and space -- and yet no one
has in fact done this for subs.  So is it really reasonable to say this
would be done for space?

No, notice I said this micro-jump was almost instantaneous (also TL 16+,
limited to small masses, and limited in how much real space it can
traverse).  I\'m positing this for game-play purposes; I can hand-wave about
surfing the first weave of hyperspace (as opposed to diving into it) later. :)

I would think that think that in order to work with larger fleets the patrol
cruiser would need to be capable of Jump 3 at TL-12.  With Jump 3 being one
of the big advantages for Cleon\'s Imperium I would imagine that most of the

Okay, but by analogy, ASW helos are effectively operating from hyperspace
(now _there\'s_ a neat TL16+ trick: have ships be able to control their stay
in hyperspace, and also be able to drop mines, "snorkles", etc. into 3space
when it pleases them!).

So, if you take ASW helos out of the picture, how does that change things
for sub-fighters?  Is there a space analogy for the noise problem you
mentioned wrt subs?  If not, if you could hand-wave away the noise problems
(loading/unloading done at a safe distance with all rubber parts, or
something), would that change things?

So, what does this say about area (volume?) denial in space?  If you think

Exactly. I don\'t think deeps space combats would occur, or at the very least
would be EXTREMELY rare. Let\'s take a look at what the Navy is for:

1. Planetary defense
2. Protection of trade routes
3. Projection of power

Of course, for planets on the conquest the order might be different.

So how would you defend a whole planet?

I would say detection is the key. Lay out sensor satellites around the planet
itself, and around any gas giants in-system. There isn\'t really much point in
worrying abut the rest. A ship can jump in-system at any point, and that is
way to much area to cover. However, for an enemy ship or fleet to make any
use of a system it has to take a useful planet or the gas giant (fuel being
one of the most important things strategically). Thus the only area denial
needed in space is of the planets that would be primary targets anyway.

How do you protect the trade routes?

Trade ships can jump in at 100 diameters, and jump out at 100 diameters. The
options for a Navy to defend trade ships include protecting the entire 100
diameter sphere, or just parts of it. Friendlies can be more easily defended
if they are required to jump in and out at certain points, so they can be
escorted, if necessary. The rest of the space can contain picket satellites
with overlapping sensors.

How do you project power?

That\'s a whole manual beyond the scope of this letter.

Okay, so by hand-waving (not necessarily a bad thing), we\'ve posited that
small space fighters are automatically faster than large space ships.
Given that, we return to the aircraft analogy for space fighters, since
their greater speed and agility makes them effective against ships of the
line.  

Not automatically faster, but in general. The absense of jump drives makes
them somewhat more cost effective, same as system defense boats.

If that\'s pretty much people\'s thinking, then I have another question...
one other advantage that airplanes have over surface craft is that they can
move in 3 dimensions instead of just 2 (plus their speed, agility, etc.).
So to extend this to space combat, has anyone ever thought of creating a
small micro-jump drive (TL16+) that enables a _small_ mass (<50 tons say)
to micro-jump to another location within about 0.1 light-second distance
virtually instantaneously, and much closer to a gravitational mass than is
normally possible for jump drives?  The image of a huge battle rider
surrounded by small fighters blinking in and out to avoid return fire,
etc., is pretty cool I think.  What do you all think of this?>>

It\'s a neat idea, but violates the basic tennants of Traveller Jump

Naturally. Although, MT rules state that the maximum agility you can have is
6. This implies (although a bit unbelievable) that my Imperial Star
Destroyer, if designed with agility-6, is just as maneuverable as the TIE
fighters it launches.
However, in general fighters are more maneuverable than larger ships.


My only comment on this is that I\'ve always despised arbitrary maximums, TNE
has no maximums, you can have a 12G ship if you want, but grav compensation
is limited by tech level and acceleration in excess of grav compensation
leads to problems for the crew.


Merrik(?):
One note, is maneuverability aside, a 5 ton craft has a lot less inertia to
move.


It may have less inertia to move, but a 6G ship is a 6G ship regardless of
it\'s mass. A 5 million ton ship rated at 6Gs can change its vector every bit
as quickly as a 5 ton ship rated at 6Gs. [Of course, it requires immense
amounts of thrust, and would probably turn night into day on any nearby
planets].

Joel:

As to the rolling of a Starship. This could open a whole can of worms.
- -Does the ship turn continously?
- -Why would it need to turn continously?
- -If the ship did turn continously, how does it lock on guns, or turn a
damaged side to the enemy?

It is my understanding that a ship turns on it\'s axis to bring guns/sensor
to bear, or to turn a damaged hull away from your opponent. What would be
the benifit to turning all the time? I can think of the above two reasons
not too.


TNE introduced the concept of ships constantly spinning on their access
during combat, the only explaination they give was to bring weapons to bear.
Other reasons could include: taking some of the load off the grav plates
(spin gravity), increasing linear stability (gyroscoping), reducing impact of
strikes by keeping surface area constantly moving (energy can\'t heat a moving
area as effectively, since it can\'t concentrate), making it more difficult to
re-target damaged areas. Also, since many ships are laid out with twin main
thrusters, rotating along the axis gives you an effectively infinite number
of thrusters, alowing changes of bearing/vector to be accomplished much more
easily in 3D space then could be accomplished if the ship is not spinning.
Attitude jets become almost unnecessary (other then to create the spin),
since a main thruster blast can be accomplished at any angle off-axis (I hope
I made this clear enough) to change bearing much more quickly then could be
accomplished with just attitude jets.

Regarding Electronic Detection:
It is my impression that electronic detection methods become very sensitive
at closer ranges, there is less clutter and less disperstion. Just look at
the electronic door openers at your supermarket, they are basically radar.

Untrue. According to TNE rules, anyway. A ship rotates about its

A ship rotates in order to bring _all_ of its guns to bear on a target.

The reason why space combat rules (again, I\'m referring to TNE rules,
since I\'m more familiar with those) don\'t differentiate between the port
and starboard sides is *because* the ship is rotating. One has an equal
chance of hitting either side.

BTW, TNE rules take fore and aft facing into account, since the ship
spins like a football, someone "in front" has no chance of hitting the
rear.

As for turning a damaged side to the enemy, why would you want to turn
the *damaged* side *to* the enemy. I assume you meant away from the
enemy. I\'ve always assumed the rotation to be relatively slow (1 or 2
rev\'s per combat round, just enough to bring all guns to bear). The
turrets are able to "swivel" themselves, in order to keep a lock on the
enemy.

Actually, that may not be right. I seem to recall something about each
weapon firing 10 times per combat round, so the rotation may be 10 rev\'s
per combat round. I don\'t have the rules in front of me. Can anyone
confirm?

TNE tried its best to model reality quite closely. (A little too closely
sometimes, I found certain rules a bit cumbersome, overwhelming and
swimming in too much detail...)

Oh, I can think of a few more...

Again, a ship with two laser turrets on port and starboard sides (ala
Far Trader) couldn\'t use both to hit a ship on one side *unless* the
ship is rotating.

Another very good reason: A laser does more damage the longer it is
trained on a particular spot. (My childhood experiments with plastic
toys, sunlight, and magnifying glasses proved this) If the ship rotates,
you force an attacking laser to distribute its energy over a greater
area, thus reducing penetration and hopefully, damage.

Reason #3: I think it would be advantagous for a ship to rotate in order
to cover more area with its sensors. Wouldn\'t a non-rotating ship "cast
a shadow" over some sensor area? eg. an active sensor on the port side
wouldn\'t be able to detect a ship on the starboard side.

And he\'s completely wrong.

Anyone who\'s mental image of space combat has fighters swooping along the
length of giant space dreadnaughts is completely wrong.

Let\'s compare 500x10-ton fighters to 1x50,000-ton battlerider 
(so that Jump drives don\'t get
in the way and mess things up.) The battlerider will be just as high-
acceleration as the fighters for a given amount of money spent on
maneuver drives. Since the battlerider has a much lower surface-to-volume
ratio, it will have *much* thicker armour for a given amount of mass/volume
devoted to armour. The fighters *don\'t* carry the same weapons as the 
battleriders, not really - to damage a heavily armoured target you need
a whopping great meson gun or PA spinal mount, which you can\'t fit in a 
ten-ton fighter. The fighter\'s weapons will bounce off the battlerider.

One might argue that the fighters are smaller, possibly more agile (since
they can rotate faster to change the angle of their thrust) and hence
harder to hit. However, such advantages only matter at moderate-to-long
ranges; at short ranges (<30,000km), no amount of agility can stop a good
closed-loop laser tracking system from hitting. A single hit from a
laser turret will destroy a fighter, so the fighters (to be effective)
have to stay at long ranges (not very exciting or heroic) plinking away
with lasers. You might as well put all the lasers on a battlerider where
you can protect them with some armour in the first place.

In the real world, aircraft won because they were orders of magnitude
faster than ships, and because they have access to weapons (torpedoes
and bombs) that have very short ranges - so ships can\'t use them
effectively against other ships - but do huge amounts of damage.
Neither of these are true in Traveller. Traveller fighters aren\'t aircraft;
they\'re speedboats with machine guns. Imagine attacking a dreadnaught
in a speedboat with a machine gun.

Even in the Real World, modern point defences have changed the roles of
aircraft - imagine trying to dive-bomb a modern CG; you\'d be eaten
for breakfast. To have any hope of dropping an actual iron bomb on a ship
you need to come in at very low level (like in the Falklands) at an
opponent with highly inadequate point defence (like in the Falklands.)
There\'s no analogy to "coming in low" in space...

In Traveller, fighters are useful (a) for patrol and space control
(b) scouting, (c) attacking and defending convoys, (d) attacking light
vessels like destroyers, (e) atmospheric operations (since lasers
don\'t work as well in atmosphere)
(f) sometimes scrubbing the sensors off 
particularly vulnerable capital ships but will never actually beat
their weight in capital ships - they\'re an important part of a combined-
arms fleet but not the ultimate weapon.

In T4, fighters do have a small advantage: fusion+, which big ships can\'t
effectively use due to the surface area requirement. This isn\'t enough to
make them the ultimate weapon, but might mean that fighters are more effective
than (say) their equivalent cost in 5000-ton destroyers - I\'m not sure.

That\'s all a matter of Gs of acceleration, "top speed" in space is fairly
close to the speed of light, so there isn\'t any real top speed. However,
beyond certain speeds it becomes difficult to engage in space combat, since
no matter how much accleration you can manage, you\'re still pretty much
traveling in a straight line.

There is a point that we are missing on the subject. A big difference between
subs and starships is communication. Submarines basically can NOT communicate
with one another while underwater, but starships can. Space fighters also
have the advantage of being able to use tight beam laser communication (laser
and maser), thus maintaining stealth capabilities. Sensor data can be handed
off to them from the carrier group, or even from a specialized sensor
frigate. Subs cannot use anythign similar, unless maybe they were all
connected via wires, and that seems impractical at best.

Try building a big ship with 6Gs, economics of scale work somewhat in
reverse. Once you get past a certain size, bridges start eating up space the

jump drives (and J-drive fuel). Thus they have added room for maneuver drive,
fuel and armor and weapons. Also, to use the aircraft/space fighter analogy,
I wouldn\'t put anything much in the way of sensors on a fighter anyway, maybe
just some active systems. Current aircraft radar is not used in the target
search role, a larger unit, notably an AWACs or ground-based radar unit (or
the Carrier\'s radar, in naval deployments) aquires the target, then hands off
coordinates to the fighter. This is the same for space fighters, using the
sensor hand-off rules and tight beam (laser or maser) communications. The
fighters don\'t even need transmitters to receive the data.

   Technically, the entire Templar order was found to be heretical by a
   church court, and then all of the Templar assets were turned over by
   the church to the Hospitallers.

   [snippage: Solomani points out that the Hospitallers were very

   Two reasons: (1) The Hospitallers were popular and still had a
   mission, running hospitals. After the crusades the Templars were
   merely an extraordinarily rich mercenary band that happened to run
   some hospices. (2) The Templars were based in France, and most of
   their properties were in France, so Philip IV of France (not Spain)
   thought he had a chance of grabbing it, since the property of
   "criminals" reverts to the crown.

   Yep. In order to make the Templars unpopular in France, Philip
   "uncovered" a ritual book of obscene practices which he attributed to
   the Templars.  BIG mistake.  Although the Templars were found
   innocent in their many heresy trials throughout Europe at this time,
   Pope Clement V, in an effort to totally hose Philip, suppressed the
   order as heretical.  The property of heretics, you see, reverts to
   the church, not the crown 8^).  Then, to add insult to injury,
   Clement handed all the property over to a nearly equivalent order,
   the Hospitallers.

   How right you are, and Clement really rubbed Philip\'s face in it. 
   Philip, however, produced a huge bill of alleged debts that the
   Templars\' estate supposedly owed to France.  So the French courts
   managed to aquire for Philip some of the properties that the church
   was about to seize.  Most, however, went to the Hospitallers, and
   France has consitantly been hostile to the Knights Hospitaller of St.
   John ever since.

I think there is some confusion as to what jiggling means. Here\'s
what I think it is.

Jiggling is a series of small accelerations in random directions over 
short periods of time. Over time, the accelerations cancel each other 
out (because they\'re random). Jiggling does not affect the actual 
course (direction-wise) of a ship when measured over a period of time.

Now, the combat round is 20 minutes. This is enough of a period for
the jiggling to have no effect on direction.

Jiggling is produced by the steering jets, not the maneuver drive.
The accelerations are small but are enough so that the ship is 
constantly changing its orientation.

If a pirate ship attempts to board a passenger liner, there are three
situations:

a) the passenger liner still has its maneuver drive
b) the liner\'s maneuver drive is disabled/off but it still has
   steering jet control (i.e. power and computer/pilot still function)
c) the liner has no power nor maneuver drive

In a) the pirate ship cannot board, period. The liner can simply 
alter its acceleration constantly so that there\'s no chance the pirate
can come alongside.

In b) the ship can jiggle around, making boarding attempts hazardous
if not impossible.

In c) the liner is dead meat. It is this situation that pirates try
to set up.

Yes but we\'re dealing with a 20 minute combat round. If I\'m the
pilot of the Free Trader, I fire with the laser on the enemy side,
flip the ship and fire with the other laser. I don\'t need to be
_constantly_ rotating.

Now, capital ships with guns everywhere need to rotate for the reason
you give. However, it\'s only necessary during combat.

The original question asked about rotating all the time. The above
paragraph IS a good reason to rotate, but only in combat. What about
when you\'re not in combat?

The placement of sensor arrays should be done in such a manner as to
eliminate the need for this sort of thing and to reduce the size of 
the shadow. And once that shadow extends to less than 25,000 km away
from the ship, it doesn\'t matter anymore because any approaching ship
is automatically detected (in MT rules).

It would be very bad design to have only one sensor array per sensor
device and have that device located in a place where most of the sky
can\'t be seen from it.

If you make it necessary to rotate the ship to make sensors able to
see all of the sky, then the complexity of the rotation varies as the
number of sensors you have. If I have only one sensor, I can just
rotate along a single axis and that sensor will see everything. If I
have five different sensors and each one is placed far from its 
neighbors (because you wouldn\'t want all of your sensors taken out with
one shot, would you?), what kind of rotation "circle" must I use to
get all the sensors able to see all of the sky within a reasonable
time frame?

The GURPS system handles missed shots very well in IMHO.

Instead of the skill roll again, or inverting, they go to the blind fire rule.

Gurps is like Traveller in that you roll under your skill. The Blind Fire
rules states "Roll under your skill with a skill cap of 9".

What this means is if you miss your target you roll again for everyone
around him. If you have a skill of 7 you roll under 7 to hit a new target.
If you have a skill of 10, 15, or even 22 you roll under 9 to hit a new target.
This rule is also used for shooting at a non visible target.

This takes skill and balances it with good old Murphy.

On a per-ton basis, it costs exactly the same amount.

This is not true, for two reasons.  First, space is close enough to a
perfect vacuum that drag effects are utterly negligible at the velocity,
distance, object size/density, and time scales relevant to Traveller space
combat.

Second, *smaller* vessels are more affected by drag then larger ones, all
other things being equal.  Surface area goes up as the square of size, but
volume (and hence mass) as the cube; since drag depends on surface area,
and inertia on mass, small objects experience more drag deceleration than
large ones (again, all other things being equal).

> Also, i would assume that a fighter could get to its top speed a whole lot
> faster than a large ship.

Wrong.  6 gees is 6 gees.  And spacecraft have no \'top speed\' in the sense
I think you\'re picturing.

We\'ve all been conditioned by watching war movies and modern carrier
operations to think of big ships as being slow, and small fighters as
being much faster.  This IS NOT TRUE in space!  A 100,000 dt battleship
with 3G acceleration is *just as \'fast\'* as a 10 dt fighter with 3G
acceleration.

The *only* way to make the figher more maneuverable involves arguments
about speed of rotation to bring the thruster to bear along a different
axis.  At the 20-minute-turn timescale of Traveller ship combat, this
makes absolutely no difference at all.  It might have a considerable
effect on close-in Star Wars-style dogfights, but that\'s not how canonical
Trav combat works; most fighting goes on over ranges on the order of a
light-second, or 300,000 km.  Being able to jink your nose around quickly
is of little use at ranges like that.

So, are fighters useful in Traveller?  Yes, possibly, but I\'d argue that
drones and missles perform almost all the same roles better.  The
advantages of multiple agile/fast small craft vs. the same cumulative
tonnage of bigger ships are:

* More targets for the enemy to deal with.  One lucky shot can destroy
  a 10,000 dt destroyer; the same isn\'t true of 1000 10-ton fighers.

* More operational flexibility.  1000 fighters can be in a lot more
  places at once than a single 10,000 dt destroyer.

The first job is clearly better handled by drones or missiles; the second
is a wash.  You can leave a drone on station without support a lot
longer than a crewed fighter, but conversely a drone won\'t react as
intelligently to targets of opportunity or other unexpected events.

Erwin,

Since I will freely admit to being out of the rules loop, help me out here.

Are there any provisions for "Silent Running", "Stealth", "EM Masking" etc.

Granted at a certain point rules have to be simplified, but. Is it logical
to say that if you could visually see it then your sensor know it is there?


My goal is to write a viable set of rules from performing an extremely
difficult operation. I by no means imagine that what I propose should be
easy. This kind of stunt should only be tried by the desperate, or insane
(where are those Marine Special Ops boys?) However, I think that there is an
open door that could be capitalized by an astute character. If nothing else,
the element of surprise goes to the crazy man in the grav fighter.

At this point it is a question of what is more important.
- -Bring weapons to bear on a Capital Target and defending damaged hull.
- -Avoiding a possible boarder craft in the middle of battle.

I would concede that if a ship knew it was the victim of an active board,
spinning may well out weigh the lack of targeting and defense. 
However if not, then why bother?

I would return with this:
The above example would translate across to a Scout Ship and a man in a
Spacesuit.

A more proper question is this:
A precision sports car throws a grapple on a flat bed truck. The Truck does
donuts. Will the Sports car be able to match speed to keep circling the

The same thing is operating in Traveller space combat.  The fastest fighter still has 
only Maneuver-6, the same as the fastest battleship.  It generally has better agility 
(under the High Guard system, anyway), but it can\'t accelerate any faster.  So submarine 
fighters are a good analogy for space fighters in this respect -- and that supports the 
argument that space fighters won\'t be an effective force in ship-to-ship actions.

I think that space fighters are more likely to be used in taking out COACC and 
supporting troops on the ground (we\'ll always have troops on the ground, because, no 
matter how big the heavy weapons and how advanced the technology, you aren\'t holding any 
piece of ground until you can keep a nineteen-year-old with a rifle on it) (I don\'t 
remember which founding father of Traveller I\'m paraphrasing there).

Yes, however that same door opener cannot detect a car moving in the parking
lot.

The big Radar dish mounted on top of a plane will not see the plane six feet
under the body of the plane. I suppose you could install door openers on the
bottom of all those planes, but at a certain point defense is offset by cost.

I am again reminded of the movie Executive Decision. They cover the docking

Okay, I can concede to these reasonings. However a ship turning 2-10 times
with in 20 minutes is not a very fast operation. I fire some guns, turn the
ship fire again, do a sensor check, make sure the targets still there, fire
the guns and then rotate. 

So the rotating is not ala a space station trying to create artificial
gravity, but more the slow role a whale might perform under water.

Traveller posits that interstellar communication is only as fast as the ships that 
travel from star to star.  This is analogous to the age of sail, before the advent of 
the telegraph (let alone the short-wave, or communications satellites).  

In those days, one of the major facets of naval warfare was finding the other side\'s 
fleet.  Small, fast, scout ships were used for that purpose, as were spies in ports.  
Nelson couldn\'t just ask the Admiralty\'s intelligence office to printout the satellite 
photos showing the location of the French fleet; his counterpart, on the other hand, 
could and did have up-to-the-minute information about the disposition of the Argentine 
fleet during the unpleasantness in the Falklands.  

Fifth Frontier War attempts to simulate this fog of war issue by requiring the fleets to 
plot their movements several turns in advance.  This probably matches the orders given 
to fleet commanders in real life, but, still, both players can see the map and actually 
know whether Jewell has fallen or not.  Other than having three maps, a referee, and two 
players with only their own forces and known enemy forces on the map, how have you 
handled this issue?  Even that is flawed, because a commander on Rhylanor won\'t know 
what\'s happened on Efate for a long time, even though the commander on Efate knows 
immediately.  Getting fifteen people together to play 5FW is a big scheduling problem; 
maybe there is computer network solution?

I thought about this a little more.  The penalty for failing the bar exam is that you 
have to take it again (and that\'s a real penalty).  In the US, the bar exam is 
offered twice a year; maybe we make it once a year for character generation.  Passing 
the bar exam entitles you to practice law in that jurisdiction; if you don\'t ever pass 
it, you can never legally practice law, and that should be reflected in your career 
path.  For example, an army JAG who can\'t pass the bar exam might have to serve in the 
infrantry, instead.  

The main advantages of passing the Imperial bar -- which entitles you to practice before 
the Imperial Courts, which generally handle more lucrative cases (although that\'s not 
the legal distinction between Imperial and local courts) -- are eligibility on mustering 
out for +Soc, TAS, and, of course, more money.

With all due respect to the Imperial Navy, sir! 

When fighting a Pirate Patrol Cruiser (400tons) with a Chrysanthemum Class
Destroyer (3000 tons), it is all well and good to apply the following actions.

What happens when the odds shift? Say you have four Patrol Cruiser gunning
for that Navy Can? At this point sending out the small craft to tie up the
pirates is a viable approach.

Next possibility: In a large fleet combat, say the fifth frontier war. You
have dozens of capital ships on each side with hundreds of small craft and
possibly thousands of munitions, satellites and other small objects. In this
situation, elite small craft sent out to cause as much damage as possible is
again viable.

Now, sir I\'m no squid, I\'m just a jarhead, so I\'m not up on these concepts
of overall strategy and such. However, isn\'t it my job to go out into the
teeth of a battle and risk it all. If a launch with 10 marines can disable a
single starship, then it has <censor> well paid for itself. 

A last note Sir. I myself would much rather be doing something while all
them Navy can\'s are duking it out. Sitting in a ready room waiting for
action is not why I joined the Imperial Marines.

The best reason is one of differing technologies.  If there is a technology
that allows a small ship to perform a certain mission better than a large
one, then the fighter can exist.

Given canon for M0, the only options are better propulsion, better power,
or better agility.

My personal design decisions were:
Small fighters can use F+ quite well.  This makes them capable of using
very small hulls.

CG is cheap, so there will be fighters within atmosphere.

Thrusters are expensive, which makes a space fighter a bit more expensive.
They can still be small.

A fighter can mount a weapon capable of punching through a civilian grade
hull pretty damn easily.

F+ needs lots of maintenance after a year or so, such that it is not a
great idea to use it on a large vessel.  Small vessels do not need
maintenance space, as they are maintained on a hanger, and thus this is
less of a problem.  (You only maintain a few at a time.)

Most pirates are not using military grade equipment.  They are toughened
enough that a civie will not usually fight, but they are going to be at
significant risk from a fighter with a good weapon.

So, the strike fighter is a great idea for attacking a soft target, like a
merchant or a pirate.  Against a battleship, it is not as good.

With my assumptions stated, I will address the points raised in previous
letters.

>> Are small space fighters believable, or have we all seen Star Wars too many
>> times?

They make sense, if there is something they can damage.  As above, I assume
they can damage soft targets.  This includes fuel shuttles, unarmored
sections of ships, thruster plates, etc.  They have a small chance of
damaging a hard target.  They also bring a sensor suite, admittedly a small
one, close to the enemy, and in my world, this is very handy.

...

>The only reason you wouldnt have Fighters in space is because of shields.

Or armor.  I rule that the large ships are capable of withstanding a few
shots by the largest weapons mountable on their class of hull, assuming
they are as tough as possible contingent on containing a weapon battery of
that class and the drives, etc. needed for that.

The square-cube law works in your favor for a large ship.  Assuming that
armor is primarily needed to cover the area of the ship, and that internal
bracing is a minor cost, a sphere twice as big has four times the area to
defend, and eight times the volume.  Thus, an 80Kt DN can have something
like twice as much armor thickness as a 10Kt vessel.

One will note, though, that armor twice as thick is not twice as good.
Greg Porter, I believe, has references that show something like a cube root
involved!

While this armor would suffice to stop a fighter cold, it means that I
cannot have my ship classes nearly as defendable.  (Quasi-modern ships get
something like n log n, as they are primarily interested in defending the
waterline.)

I hand waved at this point, and much like the gravitic focusing that makes
lasers reasonable, I decided that gravitics could degrade incoming weapons.

As an alternative, one could argue that critical systems make up a smaller
fraction of a large ship than a small one, as they have things of constant
size, or whose size grows with the area or length of a ship.

Call this whole mess the defenses.  Defenses are tough enough that a class
can withstand a heavy barrage from many ships of smaller classes for an
extended period.  They will get lucky eventually, but it is very unlikely
that a cruiser will be harmed by a destroyer\'s main weaponry for some time.

- ----start of rules digression----

I also decided that a tech level was a serious thing, somewhere between a
factor of 1.4 and 2.  A TL 12 ship would wipe the floor up with a TL 11
ship, but it would be dicey taking on two TL 11 ships.  It can take on 2-3
TL10 ships and win reliably, but four would be very bad.  As a result, 4-6
Sylean dreadnoughts would be a fair fight against a single 90Kt ship of the
late Imperium.  Note that the late Imperium called that class a cruiser.

I looked at the weapons, and decided that the technology curve of Traveller
was too flat.  Here was the setup I came up with:

Two tech levels after introduction, a spinal mount becomes a bay weapon.
Four tech levels after, it becomes a large turret weapon.  After five, it
becomes a small turret weapon.

A technology can be improved for about three tech levels, so the Meson guns
(named after Bob Meson, discoverer of the particle that decays at exactly
the same time every time.) that were used TL 13 became the spinal mounts
through TL 16, and bay weapons at TL 15, small bays at TL 16, and turret
weapons at 17.

I posit the following technologies: laser, Particle accelerator, meson,
disintegrator, gravitic beam.

I also claim that the X-laser is used for turrets instead of the particle
accelerator because of tunnel length limits.  Eventually, this is solved,
somehow.

TL   spinal         lay       say       turret
9    big laser big laser      laser     
10   big laser/PA   big laser big laser laser
11   PA        big laser big laser laser
12   PA        PA        big laser big laser
13   PA/Meson  PA        PA        big laser
14   Meson          PA        PA        X laser
15   Meson          Meson          PA        X laser
16   Meson/Dis Meson          Meson          PA
17   Dis       Meson          Meson          PA
18   Dis       Disintegrator  Meson          Meson
19   Dis/Gravitic   Disintegrator  Disintegrator  Meson

Note:

FWIW, my classes as of M0 are:
class - size - spinal weapon
Frigate/picket 100t-3000t - no
Destroyer - 3-15Kt - yes, in larger classes
Lt Cruiser 15-25Kt - yes
Cruiser 20-50Kt - yes
Dreadnought 50-100Kt - yes, often with battle riders

In my system, ships have external and internal system points for every
system.  A standard hit will take away primarily external points, and will
be degraded by armor.  A special hit will avoid much of the armor, and
damage both classes of system.  As a result, battle damage can cripple a
ship, but leave it repairable.  The systems are terribly tough, and very
well protected on a military vessel.

Yes and no - they can target important systems only at close range, because
they do not have the sensor suite that a large ship has.  They cannot
penetrate the armor typically, as they do not have the size to carry the
kind of weapon that can do that.

They are more agile, in that they can change facing quickly.  The weapons
tend to be aimed by turning the ship, which gives them larger punch than
something of this size could normally have, but slower slew.

They re not faster, and they cannot outrun the weapons systems of the
larger vessel.  Enough of them can overwhelm the ability of the gunners to
track the fighters, but that is what fleet escorts are for - mopping up
fighters.  On the other hand, such fleet escorts are what fighters can
usually hurt.

Given enough fighters, a dreadnought would be inconvenienced.

Not really.  A fighter does not have the energy resources or the space
resources to put into them.  What they can do is make a very large barrage
which is hard to stop.  Further, if the fifty lasers on the fighter were on
a bigger ship, they would be protected by proportionally more armor.  On
the other hand, the large ship has large guns.

You can make it go either way pretty easily, but it is not an open and shut
case.

Because the fighter is vastly faster, longer ranges, and carries very
powerful ordnance whose size is small compared to the destruction is
causes.  Traveller posits a lack of nuclear weapons in general, thus one
needs a lot of raw power to run the energy weapons.  To make the rules fit
the reality, all one needs is effective armor, and close in defenses that
can prevent most missiles/bombs from reaching their targets.  Since a
fighter is small, it cannot carry powerful weapons.

...

Yes, but they do not have the extremely fast fighter which we do today.
Further, they do not have the power packed destruction box that a modern
bomb represents.  The fighter may be king in large enough groups, but the
point can be made to go either way.

I have to assume that the sheilds had gaps of some kind that a close in
vessel could see and use, but that a large one could not.

   I have some idea.  Trav has always portrayed GG atmospheres as very
   dangerous places.  

   ************Spoiler***************************** In "Secret of the
   Ancients", an old CT adventure, part of the thrill was entering into
   one of these incredibly dangerous environments and finding, well, a
   floating city (built by the Ancients).  ("Secret of the Ancients" is
   the adventure that contained all the info about Grandfather and the
   final war which can now be found as a major spoiler in the
   introduction to T4.)
   ***********************************************

   CT also featured an alien race with an unpronouncible name
   (Jgd-il-jagd, or something) which lived in GG\'s and presumably had
   floating cities.

   So the subject of floating cities in GG\'s has always had a fairly
   exotic feel to it in Trav.

This tactic won\'t work unless the scouts are *significantly* further =
ahead
of the escorted vessel(s).  Since smaller ships are limited to possessing
smaller sensor suites with shorter detection ranges, they would have to =
be
located beyond the range of the sensors of the larger ships to be of any
use.  You will then need to spread these fighters out beyond this =
distance
across the forward half of the sensor sphere of the core ships.  You now
have individual-- possibly paired-- fighters light seconds apart with
minimal sensor ranges themselves (compared to larger ships).  Any larger
ships that they would happen to come across stand a pretty good chance of
detecting the fighters before being detected themselves.

Compared to modern day carrier actions, it isn\'t the fighters that do the
scouting... it is either the carrier, orbital satellites, or specially
equipped aircraft like Hawkeyes or Sentries.  Fighters don\'t generally =
even
normally assign their own targets, letting the AWACS or base carrier do
that for them using their superior radar, etc.

What do you mean by "not one of them"? If you\'re the referee, why
not create a few? They\'d be useful for refueling stations, for one
thing.

I suspect that such cities may simply not be worth mentioning. If
you know that a system has a couple of gas giants and the main
world UWP has a Tech Level of, say, 13, why not say that there are
some cities floating in the gas giants?

It\'s up to you; it\'s your universe!

This begs an interesting question.  Is there a Traveller equivalent to an
AWACS?  It would have to be a ship with a massive array of active sensors.
It would also have a suite full of controllers who are controlling the
movements of all the ships in the region.  It would have active, tight-beam
communication with all other ships in the region.  The tactical advantage
of such a ship would be huge.

My 2c  comments welcome.
<<<
I can=92t stand it. I have to argue your logic, sorry. :)
You argue that shields are the only reason for not having fighters. You
go on to argue that without shields fighters will pick off the big guys
without any trouble by combining fire and that each weapon does real
damage directly to the ship. And therefore fighters are the weapon of
choice for space fleets. =20
That doesn=92t work, and I don=92t buy it.=20
First:
IF you say that the weapons fighters use can damage a big ship, then why
can=92t the weapons damage a shield just as much? So I would remove that
argument and forget it. More importantly:
Second:
You also say that the fighter is invincible when in mass and that
everything has been reduced to protecting the carrier. Once again, I
have to argue. The only thing that stops fighters from being destroyed
in mass is cover. They have to fly VERY close to the ground and pop up
to fire weapons, or they would be destroyed. Wiped from the sky. Ask the
Israeli=92s during the 1967 war. They had total air supremacy, but ran
into the SAM net put into place by the Egyptians. Huge mess. In space,
you have nothing to hide behind. Weapon systems being just as deadly in
the future as now, I say any fighter my big ship can see, is gone. Poof.
Nothing. The closer it gets, the easier it is to destroy.=20
Third:=20
Everything is out there protecting the carrier? Wrong. They are out
there projecting force. Subs, SAG=92s, MAU=92s, Escorts, AND aircraft all=
 do
the same thing: Deny open waters and occupy zones of control. The
aircraft simply offers the Navy the ability to extend that zone. But
fighters/bombers do not, nor could they, attack an enemy fleet. Not
today.  They do extend the sensor range, collect information and feed
that information back to the big boys who carry big ship killing weapons
(i.e. missiles). Subs, bombers and ships all launch these missiles from
beyond sensor range of the enemy fleet and the missiles are your
invincible force. That is IF you have enough to peel back the defensive
layer. That same layer is VERY deadly to aircraft. Look at what we used
to teach Iraq a lesson; no aircraft, just Cruisers, Destroyers and Subs
launching cruise missiles from beyond his range. Aircraft are too
fragile to send to downtown Baghdad!=20
Forth:
Your argument also implies that small fighters carry weapons that will
cripple a large ship; cruise missile, torpedo, 1000 pound bomb,
whatever. The Traveller universe offers NO such weapon. The missiles are
more like the AIM-9 sidewinder. Kills a fighter, cripples a 30 foot
fishing boat, and ignored by the USS New Jersey. =20

So, let me paint a picture for you:
Two fleets meet in space. They both detect each other at some long
range.
Fleet A launches hundreds of fighters, each with a well trained
extremely valuable crew member at the controls, all from some very
expensive carrier.
Fleet B arms its meson guns and moves in.
Fighters get within range of lasers start to get destroyed.=20
Chance of survival for any crew: none.=20
Cost per ship: High.=20
Chance of replacing crew any time soon: Low (can anyone say Midway and
Japan)=20
Remaining fighters get with in range of their puny missiles and lasers
and start to scrape the hull, but do little real damage.=20
Remaining fighters are destroyed, picked off by direct line of sight
weapons and rapid firing weapons, e.g.  The Phalanx.
Fleet B opens up with meson gun and carrier gets cracked in half.

Sorry, Rant mode off.

>No compromise, no regrets.

I hope that is true.
Let me also say that I love the idea of fighters in space, BG, SW, etc.
Great shows and lots of fun for the PC\'s. And I think any ref who wants
to use them can hand wave them into any game. I have from time to time
because PC\'s want to play fighter jocks. I just do not think that they
have any chance of survival in space. LOS=3DKIA.

Only the newest ships will have J3 during the early M0 period.  Even
within this category, not all warships will; there\'s a lot to be said for
keeping another 12% of the ship free for powerplants and weapons, so any
ship that can succeed operationally at J2 will be built that way.

A patrol cruiser should be able to "work with" larger fleets, but I see
this more as a question of having good commo and sensors, and reasonable
jump and maneuver ratings.  It\'s not going to be in the line with the
latest, longest-range TL 12 warships during serious fighting.  At least,
not for long... :)

I\'m presuming that\'s the implicit case for all TML/ISBA activities unless

I didn\'t really want to start the discussion on the effectiveness of =

the reigning champions of space combat in Traveller.

To bring weapons to bear.  If you have 50% of your turrets on the
top of the hull, and 50% on the bottom, and you *don\'t* slowly
rotate, then you never use more than 50% at any given target.  It
almost always makes more sense to rotate.  In multi-ship battles,
hiding a facing from the enemy is moot since they are probably at a
few different facings.

Bad example, remember that the small one has to constantly change
facing and must thrust to keep in a circle in the (more or less)
frictionless environment.  It will reel you in, or break the cable.

Boarding a ship with any functional thrusters would be a major
hassle.  It wouldn\'t be easy if they were down, but it was rotating
(if I thought I was gonna be boarded I\'d _tumble_ the ship on all
axies.

To make the comparison between a single ship and a group of fighters

T::>I\'d be interested in seeing what tac-codes others have come up with...

 Well, one day when my party was "in a mood", as we describe it,
 we came up with the following:

 James "Paisley" Beam - Pilot; we never got around to naming the
                        ship.  They started out calling him
                        "Whiskey", but he always responded "Not
                        just _any_ whiskey, Royal Paisley!"

 Grey "Ageless" Doran - In spite of her Solomani name, she was
                        of pure Vilani stock.  At the time of
                        this adventure, she was 66 - and looked
                        about 30.  She was the leader of the
                        party.

 Leroy Reginald Fortescue "Icepick" Jones, III - Engineer,
                        except planetside, when he became an
                        assassin.  Named (naturally) after his
                        favorite weapon.  Started out as
                        "Reggie", because it annoyed him.

 Gashimaaru Edward "Hacker" Bryant-Shiikaradesh - Navigator and
                        Computers (Obviously).  Intrusion
                        Specialist.

 Z. K. "Flatfoot" Flanahan - ex-cop, tactician.  Refused to tell
                        anyone what "Z.K." was (Zebadiah
                        Kamehameha); when asked, would always
                        growl (literally) "I don\'t like what it
                        stands for; I don\'t use what it stands
                        for.  I\'d rather be called \'Flatfoot\'
                        than by those names."  So they did.
                        Frequently swore using the names
                        "Emmanuel" and "Miriam"; it later came
                        out that these were his parents\' names.

Yup.  That\'s it in a nutshell.  The missiles (with better rules (the
missile rules in JTAS-whatevere ages ago makes them fairly nasty,
though) could critical hit escorts I\'d think.   Larger ships would
get hull-scraped, but if they\'re in range of fighter direct fire
weapons, they\'re dead in large numbers.

If you want to use fighter effectively in space combat you will need 
to change the ship combat rules to a) allow the fighter as chance to 
survive and b) do serious damage to a ship of the line.

I have a couple of ideas.  New thread--Putting FIGHT back into 
Fighters.

1) Increase the (-) modifiers for small ships--this will increase 
fighters survival.

2) Develop ship to ship missiles that a fighter can carry that will 
serious hurt a capital ship.  The reason I lean towards missiles 
instead of strafing with lasers is that lasers are for 
self-protection and smaller targets (other fighters, ground strafing, 
etc.)

Why waste time and effort to stop rotating and start again all the
time?  But in in a rotational period of a couple minutes, and let it
spin.  Easy.

Makes sense for sensors as well.  That way you have some fixed broad
field scanning sensors----they get a bright source and point the
narrow beams at it.

When you\'re not in combat, boarding isn\'t a problem (but see sensor
point above).

One, this isn\'t MT :-)  Two, if you spin the ship, no single sensor
has a shadow perpendicular to the spin axis.  This is a great reason
for (military especially) ships to always spin.  As long a single
sensor works, you have coverage.

Most is Pi steradians (half a sphere) or so assuming the sensor is
on the hull.  That requires you to rotate to have full coverage.

The point is that it\'s always good to rotate, even if it isn\'t
always required.

I don\'t know how useful it would be, but I know I wouldn\'t want to be
anywhere near that sitting duck errr AWACS ship when it lights up it\'s
active sensors....then _everything_ will see it, unless you\'re also
positing that (like our AWACS aircraft) they also have significant jamming
capability.

Stealthy ships with huge passive arrays, now those are a horse of a
different color...I think we discussed THOSE to death a few months ago;-)

However, this DOES bring back smaller craft as fighters...if your AWAC\'s
are busy jamming all of their sensors, and they yours, smaller ships might
get in under the sensor \'snow\' and get a hit on those cap ships.

Well yes it was. I admit we rented it one night to watch. Kurt Russell is
great in the flick, Segal dies early. You did have to suspend some disbelief
considering how big the inside of the F-177 was supposed to be. 

As to the docking, with in the confines of the movie it was well explained.
Not to say it was totally believable, just parts of it.

True enough.  But one hit on a fighter is probably a mission kill
(though the 50 ton variety might be more survivable----\'cept the
enemy would likely have nastier PD weapons if the typical foe used
heavy fighters).  So each shot from the fighter has some chance of
hitting a surface feature (maybe 50% on a warship) that it will then
damage a little.  Each shot from the battlerider kills a fighter.
Even if missiles are made to seriously damage large ships, they
don\'t need the fighter at all, and in fact benefit from any
thing that helps fighters be so great themselves.

So if fighters can seriously damage large ships (with missiles, by
default) then they aren\'t needed since the missiles don\'t really
need to be carried to the target.  Note that this is less true with
TNE since the way the reaction drives worked, a typical 12g12
missile could benefit from the (reletively) endless maneuver
capability of the fighter.

     Something that might be worth considering is the fact that many
jurisdictions require an apprenticeship period either before or after bar
school.  In Ontario, it goes 3 years law school, 6-8 months articles,6-8
months bar school, loose on the streets with the power to sue.  The program
I\'m doing is 4 years at law school (the extra year gives you civil and
common law degrees), plus 8 months of bar school, plus a 6-month "stage",
before getting called to the bar.  It\'s kind of annoying to think that if I
were in California, I\'d already have been practicing for the past 6-8
months :\\...

     Maybe Volker can tell us how it works in Germany?

Agreed. I wasn\'t trying to point out how you could evade by rotating if
your main drive was out. I was trying to point out how, if you had
thrusters which could rotate your vessel, you had thrusters which would
allow you to evade laterally. Again, if you look at the original message,
firing thrusters #1 and #2 results in a net change in my course.

     A scout ship is SIGNIFICANTLY larger than a car, so the translation isn\'t

     Except we\'ve already established there\'s no inherent speed advantage in
space associated with being smaller. So the "flat bed truck" is just as
likely to be as fast as the sports car.

     And even so, given the facts of angular motion, a very small motion in
close to the center of rotation (where the truck is) results in a very
large motion further out (where your sportscar is).

True, space is not a perfect vaccum. Resistance to movement is not the main
problem with the material that is floating around it space. Energetic impact
damage is. The smaller ship may not survive higher speed impacts with random
space objects that a larger ship travelling at the same speed would barely
notice. So you shuck the armor, pick up speed, and go splat all over the
place on an equally fast moving piece of something a few millimeters in size
which would dent but not deter a bigger ship. Earlier postings mentioned the
idea of a defense mechanism that left out a cloud of ball bearing sized
objects. 100k capital ship could wade thru quite a few of these where a
fighter would vanish in the first instant.

As long as the same type of manuver drive is available to both the fighter
and the capital ship, I can not see a significant advantage. Unless the
fighter weights in at the same size as an SDB. Strip an SDB of it\'s long
term crew accomodations, replace them with added armor, fuel and munitions,
you are beginning to get a picture of what I see a space \'fighter\' as being.
X-wings, Vipers and such are just not viable.

Why bother with the fighter?  Any missile that can kill a ship costs
less than the fighter that carries it, and is expendible (unlike a
fighter pilot).

Referring to the "Lensman" series makes me wonder about the role (if any)
of telepaths and clairvoyants in the Zhodani fleet.  Although it probably
wouldn\'t happen, because the distances between vessels is so great, it\'s
very easy to envision a Zhodani admiral, snapping out orders to a crowd of
attentive telepaths, who then relay those orders to telepaths aboard other
vessels.  Meanwhile, aboard the Imperial warships that Zhodani fleet is
about to engage, the officers in charge of electronic warfare are audibly
grinding their teeth down with frustration, fully aware of what those
dirty brain-raping Zho-ies are up to, but powerless to stop them...

    'body' => 'Okay, here are all the fighter related email i have read compiled in one
big email.  Before i begin i would like to make a few things clear.  

A) Im using the ship/fighter-spaceship/Spacefighter anaology.  I think
this is the most appropriate, but it still has its flaws.  I think its the
best, unless someone has been in a real space battle and can tell us
otherwise.

b) Spacefighters are cool.  So im going to be biased anyways:)

c) Shields make a major difference in my opnion.  In a universe with
shields, fighters (10t pee-shooters) are useless unless the shields are
pathetic or the fighters have substantial fire power.  So the next premise
is that shields (Star Trek style) dont exist or are not very common.

So, the question is do Space Fighters make sense?

Economies
- ----
Unless economics are really different in the Imperium as opposed to earth
today, it will definetly be more cost effective to build a high speed,
well armed, highly maneuvrable 10t Fighter as  opposed to a Dreadnaught
with the same capabilities.  Also, lets not forget that worlds just
begining an interstellar empire would find it much easier switching an
already established industry of atmospheric fighters to space bourne
fighters, then building huge battleships from scratch.  Though i\'ll
concede the last point is not relevent to established empires like the
Imperium.

Effectiveness
- ----
How effective would a fighter be?  I think quite effective.  Militaraly a
10t fighter is more expendable then a 100,000t Battleship.  Also 10t
fighters would be easier to replace.

Fighters would be quite versatile as well.  Fighters could more easily
(and cheaply) be used for planetary warfare, so there dual role would be
valuable.

Some people have argued that they couldnt carry the firepower to effect a
Battleship.  I disagree.  Stick a fusion bomb or Fission torpedo on these
babies (the equavilent to a Torpedo) and they could wreck havoc on any
heavily armoured vessel.

Also, the ability to mass hundreds and maybe even thousands of these
babies would make them an irresistable force.  No matter how big a
battleship is or how heavily armed or armoured it is no way it would
have the Point Defense (AA) to handle such an onslaught.  No one could
conceivably argue (effectively) that a battleship could handle 100 or a
thousand fusion torpedos/missles.

After the battle, whos won both militaraly and economically?  The guy who
lost the 100,000t Battleship or the side that lost 100 fighters?  Dont
forget, lives are generally more expendable then hardware.

Another poster made the point that even in modern naval warfare planes are
not very effective against modern Point Defense.  I disagree.  If this
were so why was the last great Battleship engagement was France, 1940?
Also, why do modern Navies still rely on Carriers and land based aircraft
over battleships?  Because no matter how good or how massed your point
defense is, it wont hit everytime.  Fighters will get threw.

I disagree, your thinking in terms of 25th century offense vs 20th century
defense.  If a fighter can fly as fast as the "speed of light" (which it
cant) it is only logical to assume it would have the guidance, tracking
and maneuverability to cope with that speed, and the enemy (all things
being equal) would have the defense to match it.

Why do you say that?  What are you comparing it to? Have you flown in a
battleship?  All you can logically compare it to is a naval battle.  In a
naval battle the number of attacking craft are usually in the hundreds, if
there land based attacker, there in the thousands.  I can tell you now,
that the planes will come back with a lot less damage then the completely
destroyed capital ship.  The aircraft will fight again, but the ship will
not.

So they are cost effective.

During the battle of crete, the British sent the Meditaranian Fleet in to
withdraw commonwelth soldiers from greece as well as crete.  They had
practically zero air cover.  The germans had no naval power, only land
based aircraft.  Now British ships had been built with a dependecy on AA,
so they had thick anti-air fire.  

The Mediterranian fleet was 60% destroyed, and ever ship was damaged.  The
germans captured crete and had insignificant losses, mostly hardware, as
they were able to recover pilots.

So who won the battle both economically and militaraly?  The guy with the
air power.  Once again, im making an analogy between ships and space
vessels.

So, with all these frozen watchs and redundent systems, you still think
that fighters are not as econimical as Battleships?  Using ww2 squadron
sizes, i would say 1 carrier with 250 planes could take out that
battleship.  The planes would live to fight another day, the battleship
is permeantly lost.

I disagree, show me an historical example.  Name one naval battle where a
battleship with out aircover went into battle with a carrier and won? Show
me these high morale marines of yours?  From ww2 to modern times, a
battleship would be going on a suicide mission against the carrier.  And
your telling me the Battleship would have higher morale knowing they had
been sentenced to death.  Not likely.

Not to mention the fact that two sides are rarely evenly matched, so your
example is fraudelent.

Not really, since most of these weapons will be designed for larger ship
targeting.  I cant remember the last time a saw a spinal mounted Meson

This is an incorrect assumption.  Top speed is whatever a space craft has
been built to go upto.  Im sure light speed isnt one of them (mayb absurd
speed:).  Each tech level logically would have an upper limit of the
absolute fastest speed it can build engines to.

Wrong.  Its to simplistic.

Your assuming that theres no surprise, which is a major part of any naval
(space) battle.  If you can say "midway" you should also know that the
americans took the japanese by surprise, and both were carrier fleets.

Your also assuming that Turret mounted weapons can be used against
fighters.  This makes no sense.  A ship would have large weapons
(equivalent to a naval ships Canons) and AA (Point Defense) also a batch
of missles.  The large weapons would be useless against fighters, since
they are designed for Capital ship-to-ship battles.  So there only defense
is AA.  This means that a hell-of-a-lot more fighters are not supperessed
and make it threw to the target and unload there weapons.  They would
would then return to ther ESCORTED carriers to rearm while a second wave
of fighters approach.

Thirdly, your assuming that the fighters have pee-shooters for weaponry.
This also makes no sense because they would be useless.  They would be
carrying a barrage of missile/torpedo based weaponry, which would do much
more that just \'scrape the hull\'.

Why would anyone want to?  You\'re at the bottom of a huge gravity well,
making travel to and from your city expensive and dangerous; you need both
CG lifters to stay up, and grav comp to weigh less than 500 lbs.; if the
former fails for more than a minute or two, your whole city is dead and
crushed; the only important resource is hydrogen, which is more economical
to scoop (maintaining a good chunk of orbital velocity) than to export
from rest relative to the planet.  Not where *I* want to live!

In the Imperium, I\'m sure there are a few grav-cities on Jovians, for
specialized reasons -- trade with natives (where they exist) being one
interesting possibility.  But you won\'t find many of them.

After you hit an enemy ship do you set a timer so when the next "turn"
comes around 20 minutes you hurry to flip the ship over to target the enemy
with the other laser? "Turns" are abstractions for game purposes; in
reality all the targeting, maneuvering, recharging, sensor activity, and
flipping is going on constantly. A ship that flips over constantly is
spinning.

Why go to the expense of installing redundant sensor arrays when you can
just spin the ship so one array covers the entire sky?

I don\'t follow. If I install a second sensor the "complexity of rotation
varies"? How? If I install one sensor on the side of the ship and spin the
ship, the sensor can sweep the entire sky. If I install another sensor both
sweep the entire sky. Do you think sensors say "oops, I can\'t scan there
because some other sensor is looking there too"?

I beg to differ. Water, beer, fruit, cargo, passengers et al are all
unrefined. Extracting the hydrogen will yield less than 10% of its mass as
fuel. Even if the entire ship was a cargo bay of beer it wouldn\'t have
enough hydrogen for a jump-1.

Unfortunately practically every ship in the rule books is designed to
contain only enough fuel for 1 maximum jump. Ergo, the first time you
misjump, you die.

The chance of total loss of the entire ship, crew, and cargo is 1/36 for
every jump, minimum. This works out to about 50% chance of total loss per
year. If car travel had the same chance of accident then western
civilization would become extinct since no one on Earth who ever traveled
in a car would live to reproductive age. The same is true for starships
using the T4 misjump rules. The T4 misjump rules are totally, ridiculously,
broken.

Do missle carring fighters have a MFD?  The reason is that I though that
missle armed fighters where a one shot wonder and came up with a battle
plan to keep the useful.

The plan is that they are launched from the battlerider then close to
missle range.  Just as the fighters get into missle range and fires
there missiles, the battlerider fires long range missles in volleys and
passes control over to fighters when they are free to guide them onto
target.

The result is that the sensors will be flooded with incoming
missile/fighters, more so if the fighters are giving the same return as
a missile.

Why would turret be useless against fighters. Because they\'re designed that
way, so that space combat will be exactly like WWII? Sorry but Traveller
isn\'t StarWars. A fighter at 30 000 klicks will be pretty easy to track
with even a mesom gun spinal mount. Forget about your images of daring
fighter pilots dodging through the barrage to cripple the hapless Japanse
err Zhodani warships.

This is space combat with speed of light weapons that can hit at 30 000 km
or more. If we\'d like space combat to resemble WWII then why not introduce
a space analogy to sea state: "space state". And perhaps submarine
anologies: subspace fighters that silently lurk beneath the normal space
waves ;)

    Technology, Need and Neccessity.  To make a submarine fighter work you need
an extremely compact power plant, Fusion Plus would work. ;)  Though there has
been some interesting and ingenious work being done with submarines that "fly"
through the water, mostly at the experimental and concept demonstration stage
right now.  The Navy did some work on using lasers (blue-green if memory
serves) at depth to punch through submarine hulls.  Power requirements are a
bitch!  But they do work, power was the problem, and this was done back in the
late seventies, technology may well have caught up to make this practical in
the next few years.
    Which leads us to why do you Need one?  Durring the Cold War?  Yes and the
US Navy did some theoretical and experimental work on the idea.  But who out
there in the oceans do you need a submarine fighter against?  The US Navy has
the Los Angeles Attack boats, the best in the world without question.  Nobody
else has a big enough submarine fleet to bother the US.  There\'s no compelling
NEED for submarine fighters.
    Now neccessity is another matter, IF we see greater and greater development
of the underwater resources of the planet then submarine fighters may become a
neccessity.  In theory they would be cheaper to build, man and maintain.  But
the neccessity of their development is dependant on other factors.  Political,
economic, social and others.

    That\'s Real World/Real Life.  IMHO I suspect the development of "flying"
type submarines is inevitable and will eventually lead to a form of Submarine
fighter.  Already the rapid advances in technology are changing the character
and type of warfare the future generations of submariners will wage.  The
Oceans of the planet cover 3/4 of the surface, given how far Humanity has gone
with the 1/4 above water... you have to wonder how well we\'ll do with the
remaining 3/4!

Heck our own planet can\'t even agree to agree on standard arrival and

discussion here as to what types of standards might be used and how word gets

carriers and private use spacecraft).  

There was a pioneer aviator (true story), that went around the world and

he visited.  After many years he had quite a collection and aviators began
paying him for copies of them.  Word spread and he soon found himself in

every approach he got his hands on the see if it was safe or accurate.  But
this didn\'t become evidant until many years had passed and his little company

room for a myth to develop around a legendary star pilot that charted out the
common arrival procedures at the many hundreds of star systems.

This is not economical though, which is the whole point of fighters.  The
American navy could (theoritically) build a Battleship (HS) which could
travel as fast as a speed boat - but why would they?  Its redundent - no
military advantage - and above all else, its expensive, VERY expensive.

So your first supposition is unsupportable.  I hope your argument wasnt
based on it. Lets read on and find out.

This logic also doesnt follow in the real world.  Remember, none of us
have been on a Space battleship (Aurora class:) so we can only compare
our theories to real world examples (as close as possible any way).  How
were the Japanese able to destroy the Prince Of Wales and its
sister ship in ww2 just with naval based air power?  

The prince of wales and sister were the best Battleships the british had,
also the newest. most heavily armed and armoured, bristly with AA.  The
japanese lost no planes, the ships were sunk in a matter of hours.  

If a fighter has the right weaponry (For space combat i would say missiles
and space bombs with proxiamety charges) it just doesnt matter how thick
the armour is.  People seem to think fighters are one shot weapons, there
not.  They hit in waves, first waves drops there payload, returns to
carrier, refuels and rearms.  While this is going on the second and third
waves have hit.  A Battleship can only take so much damage from Nuclear
warheads and Fusion/Fission/Anti-Matter bombs.

Armour is a measure of endurance in these sort of battles, not a guarntee
of safety.

I dont think this is plausiable either.  Your assuming that fighters are
one-hit weapons and that they have no counter measures.  I also think its
absurd that you effectively state that a fighters agility is helpful at
medium to long ranges, but useless at short ranges.  At short ranges is
where it counts.

I would love to see an example of what you said in any modern battle.
Show a battle where a fighters agility works against them at short range.

Aircraft won because of speed and agility, and being able to deliver
high-powered explosives without being hit, and being able to do this
repeatedly. 

How wouldnt this hold true in Traveller?

Also, your speed boat analogy is good, but still wrong.  Its still
2-dimensional.

Thats why AC weaponry has increased in range and accuracy.  I also dont
believe point defense is as effective as you claim.  500 planes swoop down
on a ship, and its dead baby.  Point defense may take down a few, but
the rest are still going to deliver there payload.

  A couple of quick (if unpopular) observations about
the fighter and boarding debates.  Isn\'t it important
that solutions be internally consistent?

eg) if near-instantaneous micro-jumps are allowed,
 then what does this imply for unmanned "fighters"
(aka drones/torps) with huge fusion bombs?

eg) if my stealth bus can deliver a boarding party,
why not lead it with Ensign Robby the Robot and his
fusion bomb party favours?

  SFB banned ramming, _except_ for shuttles landing
boarding parties by crashing enemy hangar bays.  They
also allowed transporting boarding parties onto enemy
ships, or nukes into space as mines, but not nukes
onto the enemy ship.  Why?  Waiting for someone to
write it up as a brilliant new tactic?

  If an arbitrary rule (not tech hand-waving) is the
only way out of a seeming contradiction, then maybe
the idea isn\'t supportable to a sufficiently high
level.

  OTOH, they can simply publish the tech and let the
warmongers figure out what works best.  Jeune Ecole,
anyone?

I use a system comming from WhiteWof RPG (Vampire, Werewolf...)

Each adventure session
End : 1 automatic point
Learning curve : 1 point if the player can explain something he have learned
Heroic : 1 point if the player has takes significant known risks for the
sake of the adventure
Role playing : 1 point if the player has done a good roleplaying

Each Camapgn
End : 1 automatic point
Success : 1 point if the players had mastered their goal

You can multiply the number of point as you want, or adding new sources of
points. In fact there are two others but I don\'t remeber.

Another system easier to use at the begining is to award point directly
during the game. But no on dices results as many games do. Roleplaying
might be a good way of judgement. 
If a player have done good decisions in a gun fight and so were efficient
(not the dices results) award him immediatly a point in the skill YOU find
approriate to the situation. 
If a player have found a important clue for the adventure give him a point
for INT  (don\'t hessitate)
Beware of forgetting other players. IMO, the points awards have to be
intuitive and not programmed on the adventure (they go their they have a
point... no good)

Don\'t forget that our planet today is a balkanized TL 7 backwater slimy

they can dictate stuff such as approach procedures and the member worlds
will comply or their starport gets shut down.

Always remember that the Imperium is NOT like earth and the same could be
said to the guys advocating strict adherance to WWII naval tactis in space
combat.

All this IMHO and of course as ref you are free to decide how it is done in
your universe. there were some articles about this in High Passage under
the heading "Inward clearance" that could shed light on this topic.

Yup.  Worth every penny to see Steven Seagal get blown out of the docking

Possibly beyond the capabilities of the grappling vessel\'s maneuver drive
rating.  Depending on how far away the two ships are, trying to match the
target ship\'s movements could very well require that the grappling ship
expend more than 6Gs to keep up.

And the Americans had "radar"... and the Americans had "Magic" (ie: they
had broken the Japanese code ahead of time and Midway was basically an

How far away are these fighters when they fire their missiles?  How do =
they
even get that close without being shot down before hand?  Few fighters
would be able to get within 30,000km (0.1 light-second), since turreted =

of
the turreted weaponry (out to 300,000km, easy).  The turret itself isn\'t

Lasers would be pea-shooters only because the fighter\'s powerplant would
not be able to power the larger lasers necessary to punch through heavy
armour.

If their primary armament was missiles, it would make much more sense to
fire them from further away (where the fighter would be at less of a =
risk).
That is the whole point of missiles now-a-days, with some munitions =
having
stand-off ranges of over 100 kilometres.  By releasing its missiles from
further away, you would increase the odds of the fighter surviving by
giving the target more to shoot at.  If you delayed launching missiles
until the last possible moment, the enemy only has to fire at one target
instead of three or five to destroy all of your missiles.

Traveller simplification.  Like having a Master\'s degree as a 2 year

Not so.  It is cheaper to armour a dreadnaught that it is to armour a
fighter.  You are also forgetting that fighters need carriers, a
further expense that makes a fully loaded carrier *more* expensive
(and therefore, not nearly as cost effective).

Of course a 10t fighter is MORE expendable than a 100,000t battleship!
One costs *significantly* more than the other!

Granted.  But fighters cannot perform many of the roles that larger

actions, prolonged planetary bombardment, etc.).

Nuclear missiles are expensive, and easily defeated by nuclear dampers
(giving those nuclear damper turrets-- that were otherwise just
sitting there-- something to do).  And if used, the fighter would be
vapourized in the blast... this is based on one of your earlier
postings stating that fighters would release their missiles inside the
minimum effective ranges of the target\'s offensive and defensive
weaponry.

I\'m (we\'re?) not trying to.  I am trying to explain the effectiveness
of two *equally balanced* sides in a Traveller space combat, one
composed of fighters and one composed of a single Capital ship.  Only
under such circumstances can you determine how cost effective fighters
are when compared to a single larger ship.

By attacking a Capital ship with a swarm of fighters costing two or
three times as much, all you are stating is that "the side with the
bigger, more expensive fleet wins".  You could just as easily replace
the fighters by a half dozen Capital ships based on this argument.

Wrong!  It takes twenty years to breed a pilot, and only a few days to

You\'re arguing logic versus something you just said wasn\'t possible
(fighters travelling near the speed of light).  This doesn\'t make any
sense to me.

A fighter 30,000km away from a target is 1/10th of a light-second
away.  No amount of electronics or jinking will prevent a laser from
striking the fighter when it only takes a tenth of a second for the
beam to span the distance.

No you can\'t.  This is moot, since we have already concluded in other
posts that modern day naval/air combat is not a fair comparison to
Traveller-style space combat (ie: Traveller dreadnaughts can be built
to be just as "fast" as fighters).

Hundreds? Thousands? You seem to be saying that fighters would be the
"king" of Traveller space combat, yet your arguments only talk about
overwhelming the opponent with massive numbers.  In any situation,
this will most certainly be true.  By your own arguments, it is not
the effectiveness of the "fighter" itself, but the effectiveness of
their "massive deployment" that would result in such lop-sided
victories as you mention.

250 PLANES !?!  Check your history books again.

A modern carrier might have approximately 60 or 70 different aircraft
on board, but they are not all capable of performing the same mission.
You might have a dozen or so F-14s (air superiority), maybe two dozen
=46/A 18s (ground or air attack), a six-pack of Intruders (bombers),
Vikings (ASW), EW aircraft (jamming), and helicopters (ASW, search &
rescue), as well as one or two EWACS (early warning radar).

I specifically said *equally matched*, yet you reply with a scenario
that clearly isn\'t.  This whole thread started about the effectiveness
of fighters in the Traveller universe, yet your replies are mostly
based on latter 20th century air/naval combat, as well as massive
overkill attacks.  In an equally matched Traveller space combat, I\'d
rather be behind the Capital ship\'s substantial armour (within easy
access of a sickbay, if necessary) than in a small fighter less than
30,000 km away being fired upon by laser batteries with ROFs of 800
per Combat Round.

Using any of the official (and unofficial) space combat rule systems
for Traveller, fighters are not much more than target practice at
point blank range for the crew of a Capital ship.  These crews would
be shielded by the ship\'s heavier armour, while the incoming fighters
would be facing multiple laser batteries capable of firing nearly once
per second (with a single hit most likely causing a critical hit),
plus sandcasters and-- if you are still using CT-- repulsors.

You keep repeating that a fighter swarm could easily take out a
Traveller Capital ship if enough fighters are used.  This is no basis,
however, for your argument that states that the fighter (singular)
would be the dominant force in a Traveller-style space combat.  Again,
all you are really arguing is that "the better funded side wins".

Your *whole argument* is invalid, since you keep comparing Traveller
space combat with modern day air/naval combat.  They are not the same.
Stick to the Traveller universe.

According to Traveller rules, there is no distinction of weapons
specifically designed to target large or small vessels.  Actually, the
spinal mount is the *only* weapon that would be incapable of hitting
an enemy fighter (except by luck).

What upper limit?  In an atmosphere, vehicles have an upper limit on
the speeds that they can travel based on the fact that drag increases
with speed.  As speed increases, the vehicle requires more and more
energy to counter this drag.  Planes, trains, and automobiles all have
engines that are designed to provide a certain amount of acceleration.
You will eventually arrive at a point where the engine\'s power cannot
counter the drag.  This is that vehicle\'s maximum speed.

In space, however, we have no drag.  Thrust remains constant
throughout the spacecraft\'s acceleration (assuming an unlimited fuel
supply, of course).  Things only get interesting when the vessel
begins to approach the speed of light (where it would gain in mass--
thereby reducing its acceleration).

To conclude:

If you want to prove to me (using Traveller ship combat rules) that
fighter swarms are effective vs. lone Capital ships, stay away from
20th century air/naval combat comparisons and keep both forces equally
matched.  That way, the true effectiveness of the fighter will be made
clear (and not the effectiveness of an overwhelming number of
fighters).

I think fighters in traveller would be more analogous to FAC\'s. Small fast
maneuverable packing a big wallop. However one should be aware of the very
real disadvantages of such craft: virtualy no defences, very limited EW
capacity and very poor targeting.

Have to agree on that point :*) Fighters are way cool

You are making a good point. Many emerging worlds will choose to go
with fighters for economic reasons as well as tactical reasons. The
Juene Ecole of space :*).

>How effective would a fighter be?  I think quite effective.  Militaraly a

The fighter is, the pilot isn\'t. This one fact is a vital consideration.
To be effective a fighter would require a very well trained crew. They
just don\'t have the size to mount the sensors of a big ship and their
crews aren\'t large enough for any slack.

>Fighters would be quite versatile as well.  Fighters could more easily

>valuable.

So can a battleship, it sits up high with good defenses against planetry
based fire and shoots down. Very effective. A fighter on the other hand
has to go down to where atmospheric interceptors (more effective than
general purpose space fighters) can engage.

However I would agree that in interface work fighters would be in their
element. If your going to meet fighters anywhere it will be here.

Carrying a weapon is very different from being able to target with it.
The biggest weapon in the world is of little use if you can\'t hit with it.
In space combat the velocity are going to so great that you\'re going to
have very short engagement times. Therefore you are going to need some
very effective targeting and control; and there will be a minimum size craft
required to mount it.

A battleship (100,000Td+) could quite concievably handle several hundred
missile attacks and probably absorb quite a few that get through. Plus
battleships wouldn\'t operate individually, they\'d operate as part of an
intergrated task group with significant small escorts, greatly increasing
their survivability.

>After the battle, whos won both militaraly and economically?  The guy who

Most certainly not, especially for pilots! Hardware is expendable, lives
are not. Pilots are always an elite, you can\'t throw them away, if only
for the morale considerations. Remember in space the recovery rate for
pilots who\'s fighters are lost is going to be close to nil.

The hstorical reason for the supremacy of the carrier is very simple, it
can be summed up in one word: Range. A battleship is capable of absorbing
far more damage than a carrier, can carry far better defences and can
fight in conditions which will leave a carrier floundering. The only
advantage the carrier has is range. A battleship can engage targets maybe
40Km away, a carrier 400Km away. In space this advantage is much less.
Plus much of the aircrafts advantages depend on recoving a significant
number of lost crews, which isn\'t going to happen in space.

Oh and BTW the last classic battleship dual was in the Pacific in 1944.

A big ship can put its critical systems at its core. Making them all but
impossible to hit. You will be able to hurt a ship by hitting its vulnerable
surface systems, but your unlikely to kill it. What you can do however is
soften it up for an easy kill by a bigger ship.

The fighter/ship analogy is not a good one, a far better one is FAC/ship.
space fighters don\'t have the massive speed advantage. Throw 100+ Osa II
against a Iowa plus escorts and the Iowa wins. Space fighters won\'t be able
to do the hit and run that modern aircraft rely on against ships.


>So who won the battle both economically and militaraly?  The guy with the

Space fighters are not airpower, they just don\'t have the same advantages.
They are torpedo boats or FAC\'s. During the last years of the 19th and early
years of the 20th centuries the Germans and French both invested heavily in
this theory, it didn\'t work. The defence was too simple, bigger craft
designed to take them out (the destroyer).

Historical examples of surface ships vs carrier where the surface forces
won:
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau against Glorious
Japanese against the TF77 at Samar

Historically carriers lived in dread of being engaged by surface forces,
that\'s one of the main reasons why their escorts where heavy with cruisers
and battleships. The mere mention of a surface task force nearby was
enough to make even the most bull headed carrier commander (Halsey springs
to mind) pack up and run. When carriers are engaged by surface forces, the
carrier losses. Carriers rely almost entirely on their ability to engage
the enemy before they can be engaged.

>Not to mention the fact that two sides are rarely evenly matched, so your

"Be there firstest with the mostest" (I can\'t remember who said that, but
it does pretty much sum up warfare).

Yes, but battleships would carry comparitevly few big guns, most of their
weaponry would be smaller weapons to keep fighters and other smaller ships
at bay. The big guns would be truely impressive, but they would have a
very respectable secondary armarment.

>>Also, i would assume that a fighter could get to its top speed a whole
>>lot
>>faster than a large ship.>>

Not true. The acceleration will be similiar. The fighter\'s advantage will
be maneuverability. A smaller ship will turn better. In traveller space
combat is likely to be a series of high speed passes. The fighter\'s big
advantage is that it can pass and turn for it\'s next attack better.

Fighters have a place in space combat as part of an intergrated task force.
Your fighters can soften up a target for an easy kill or finish off cripples.
It is better to regard them as the rough equivelants of early 20th century
torpedo boats. But they wouldn\'t be the beloved 10Td single place fighter,
they\'d be much bigger (start at 50Td) and probably have a crew of 2-4. I\'d
call them missile boats.
