produce weapons with more powerful pulses than one with rapid amounts of
fire. I\'m assuming that if more than one shot can hit the same spot in a
short amount of time then their Mj outputs will combine, penetrating
further. Problem is you still need insane ROF\'s to do this. Eg counting 2
or more hits in the same spot within a second as cumulative it would take
a ROF of 300 to increase the power of hits against a perfectly still
object (FA diameter & target speed make things even worse).

	So my question was a bit stupid wasn\'t it? Oh well....

NB: Yes I do know what a homopolar generator is everyone!!! I just
    describe it as a battery in *game terms* - it stores rather than
    produces.

	I thought the person owning the copyright got the licensing fees ... i.e.
Marc Miller. Unless Sweetpea has an exclusive contract with him, that also
allows them to "sublicense."

    'body' => 'I\'ve constructed a series of informational posts for my players.  We\'re
playing the Traveller Adventure, and these posts are designed to
familiarize them with the March Harrier, a Type R Subsidized Merchant.

I re-engineered the Harrier according to QSDS v1.5, and I am drawing my
information from this, the Starship Operator\'s Manual, The Traveller
Adventure, backstories to my own campaign, the Seeker deck plans we are
using, and other sources.

After completing these for my own group, I thought that the information
may be useful to other GMs running their own version of the Traveller
Adventure.  

I am posting the series of posts I\'ve written about our ship for those
people.  You may be interested in making similar posts for your players,
or just take mine, eliminate the references to my game, and replace the
blanks with the names of the characters in your game.

I\'m not sure if anybody will find this useful, but if you are running
the same adventure, you might.  So, here it is.

This first post focuses on the hull.  You\'ll notice that I\'ve written
the posts in plain, layman\'s terms because only one of my players has
ever played Traveller before (and that was years and years ago in the CT
days).  Given their lack of knowledge of Traveller as a whole, I find it
is better for them to spell everything out.

For clarity with the dates below, my campaign started in 1105, in the
Aramis subsector of the Spinward Marches.  If you are running a M0
campaign and wish to use this information, you\'ll need to change some
things.

Kenneth.
=====================================================================================

(the following is the posted information from my game)

This is going to be a short series of posts designed to educate you on
The March Harrier.

These will be short, so take a few minutes to look over the information
contained herein.

If you have any questions, ask.

========================================================================
HULL

The Harrier was laid down on 363-1083 (22 years ago) at Naasirka
Shipyards in Leedor (Aramis/Aramis/Spinward Marches) as a part of the
March Subsidy Program.  This program is directed at serving
freight/passenger/mail needs for citizens of the Imperium whose home
planets lie off the main trade jump routes.

The Harrier was built to serve the 8 systems in the Aramis Trace, all
connected by Jump-1:  L\' oeul d\' Dieu, Aramis, Natoko, and Reacher in
the Aramis subsector;  Vinorian, Nutema, and Margesi in the Rhylanor
subsector;  Saarinen in the Sabine subsector of the Deneb sector.

The Harrier is subsidized, indirectly, by the Imperial government.  The
subsidy is administered by Oberlines Lines, a trade and freight company
based out of the nearby Regina subsector.  

She took a year and two months to build, having her first flight on
060-1085 (20 years ago).  The ship originally had a Vargr captain, and
this original Vargr crew ran the ship for 12 years until they were
killed (allegedly) by Shawn Grey (then, the communications officer
aboard the Harrier).

Grey fled prosection, and the ship lay in drydock at the Naasirka Yards
on Aramis, her home port, for 8 years.  Late in 1104, Grey pulled the
ship out of drydock for a refit and overhaul.  Just before the new year,
the ship\'s third captain, Luke Drake, took over and finished the
overhaul.  On 202-1105 (5 weeks ago), a message was sent to the
Oberlines subsector headquarters on Paya detailing ownership for the
Harrier\'s fourth owner, Captain Lance La Graus.

The ship was built from pre-fab, standardized, modular components, and a
standard set of architectural plans.  The standard design is that of the
Type R Subsidized Merchant, sometimes called the "Fat Trader", known
throughout the entire Imperium and beyond.

THIS INFORMATION FOCUSSES ON THE MARCH HARRIER\'S HULL:

The Harrier\'s hull is a TL 12 cylinder configuration.  It has been
modified as an airframe, allowing entry into any type of atmosphere.

The hull is 400 tons displacement (meaning you can fill it with 400
tons, or 5,600 cubic meters, of liquid hydrogen).

The internal structure of the hull is braced for 1G accelleration, and
if a faster M-Drive is ever installed, the hull will need to be braced
for the increased accelleration.

The hull costs Cr17,300,000, and as a standard hull, it comes complete
with life support systems, airlocks installed, control systems
installed, cargo hatches installed, artificial gravity systems
installed, inertial compensation systems installed, and contra-grav
lifters for landing and taking off.

All hull systems are TL 12.  The total power requirement for the hull
and it\'s systems is 109.4 Mw.

The hull is streamlined for atmospheric use, and fuel scoops have been
installed for skimming fuel at gas giants.

The hull is made out superdense material.  Referring to the Starship
Operator\'s Manual, superdense "begins by selecting the hull material
(usually crystaliron).  When the hull is formed, it is subjected to
massive gravitational fields.  The internal nuclear forces are
manipulated, and the atomic structure undergoes partial collapse.  As a
result, the density ofthe hull (and thus its durability) is greatly
enhanced while its thickness is minimized."

After all of the hull\'s systems are accounted for, there is 381.3 tons
of usable interior volume in which to place other ship\'s components
(which will be in other posts).  The usable surface area of the hull is
1684 square meters.  

The hull (and thus the ship) is 44 meters long.  The ship is 10 meters
high and 15 meters wide.  The wing span is 32 meters.

Finally, we look at the hull\'s Traveller combat statistics.

Armor:  0
Structure:  9

The hull is not armored.  The superdense material gives the hull a
structure of 9 (The ship has 9 hit points for space combat, so to
speak).

Next up?  A quick post on the Jump Drive.

Number:  1900  Name:  BLACK DUKE OUTLINE
Address:  J.FUGATE  Date: 02/24/90
Description:
This is a detailed working outline for would-be writers to peruse. If
anyone sees a section they would like to help write (perferably one
of the adventure scenarios), then E-mail j.Fugate and let him know
you would like to talk further.

BLACK DUKE WORKING OUTLINE (96-PAGE BOOK)
I. Introduction
  A. What\'s in this book?
    1. Background data & maps on Dulinor\'s factionary turf
    2. Campaign adventure material for extended play with interlinked
        small adventures
    3. New minor race information
    4. New starship information
  B. How do you use the material herein?
    1. PC type useable for this campaign
    2. Improved Cinematic nugget version of adventure material
       a. Scene & Action
    3. Use of the background material for further campaigning
II. The Campaign  A. Fiction/Introduction to the Campaign
    1. What the initial situation is and where it will lead
       a. Itinerary of the campaign (map of the route)
         i. variations possible in itinerary
    2. Description of the Lady Jo
       a. The Lady Jo will be an Alexandria class free trader
    3. Description of the Tukera Lines freighter
       a. The Tukera freighter is a type AT freighter
       b. Deckplans of the Tukera Lines freighter
       c. Description of freighter\'s layout/compartments
  B. Crew NPC\'s of the Tukera freighter
    1. NPC illos, stats, and descriptive blurb on each detailing
        background & status
    2. Another NPC (or 2 crew NPC\'s) might be an Ael Yael for alien fun
    3. Putting two Suerrat (mates?) on the ship might be good, too
  C. Scenario #1 - A Prequel: \'We love our ship\' (5 pages)
    1. This is designed to get the PC\'s attached to their ship so that
        when they have to leave it, they\'ll still want to get it
        back (therefore they\'ll go off to make money for repairs)
  D. Scenario #2 - \'Into the Drink on a Planet\'
    1. Players\' set-up info:
      a. Setting out on board their ship, the Lady Jo, the characters
          get hit by commerce raiders and must head for the nearest world
          in order to make repairs.  The ship doesn\'t quite make it to
          the spaceport, and instead lands in the shallows off-shore
          from the spaceport.  Ship needs to be pulled out and have
          major repairs done on it - all of which will cost major bucks
          that the PC\'s don\'t have.
    2. Referee\'s notes on this scenario:
      a. World description with spaceport map
      b. Need to provide notes on getting the PC\'s successfully into
          this pickle
         i. Notes on running the raider combat
        ii. Where the Lady Jo should/shouldn\'t get damage
       iii. Coming in for the landing
            (1). Power plant/thruster plates failure?
            (2). Navigation/attitude thrusters out of control?
            (3). Somehow, they should end up in the drink
  E. Scenario #3 - Gaining the Suspicions of Dulinor\'s or Lucan\'s
      intelligence branch (3 pages)
    1. Players\' set-up info:
      a. Somehow the PC\'s will get the attention of an intelligence
          officer of Dulinor\'s or Lucan\'s (not sure which to use;
          maybe both?).  Being on a Tukera ship in Ilelish will be
          bad enough (in the Dulinor\'s case), but something else
          should happen here to make them seem all the more suspicious.
    3. Referee\'s notes on this scenario:=20
      a. Some sort of location map for this scenario
      b. Background information on Tukera/Dulinor relationship at
          present
  F. Scenario #4 - Fun with Aliens (8 pages)
    1. This scenario should involve at least one of the new minor
        races of this sourcebook.  Perhaps a visit to the race\'s
        homeworld would be in order.  Ref\'s info should include alien
        NPC info, a map of the homeworld region visited (maybe a map of
        the whole world, too), and maybe some info/stats on some sort
        of alien vehicle/equipment used by the PC\'s.  The aliens
        should play a fairly major role here, and overall, the tone
        should be one of discovery (perhaps enigma) rather than peril.
    2. Having a planet where you must procure and wear a specific
        type of business garb in order to be taken seriously in
        trading could be fun
        a. These outfits would be ridiculous, uncomfortable and hard
            to move in - but if you don\'t wear them, no one takes
            you seriously as a business-sophont
    4. Something Suerratian might also be good here, perhaps with some
        other aliens also being prominent
  G. Scenario #5 - Something with a Mercenary Company (5 pages)
    1. What might happen here is some meeting-up with a mercenary
        company (maybe hired/commandeered to transport supplies/troops
        somewhere).  This is mainly to tie in with the Mercenary
        interview; it may also add some Rebellion shoot-out type
        excitement.  Perhaps the Unification Day raid (Unification
        Day=3DSoviet May Day) could be fit in here with the major attack
        force being mercenaries hired by an anti-Dulinor/pro-Lucan
        underground resistance on this world in the heart of Dulinor\'s
        Domain.  PC\'s would be caught in the crossfire action,
        maybe some captured by the mercenaries and held as prisoners
        for ransom of some sort (mistaken identity type thing?).
        Perhaps a passenger from the Tukera ship could be used as
        the catalyst here.
  H. Scenario #6 - Fun with Gas Giants (5 pages)
    1. The PC\'s come into a system known to have a fuel depot only
        to find when they arrive that the depot has been hit by
        commerce raiders and the fuel taken/destroyed
    2. An x-boat has been dispatched but it will be another week
        and a half for new supplies to reach the depot
    3. The depot is located on an airless world and was just a drop-off
        depot with no on-world fuel supplies
    4. PC\'s can wait around (no fun?) or can try fuel-skimming an
        in-system gas giant with their shuttle for fuel
    5. If they opt to skim:
      a. There are lifeforms in the atmosphere of the Jovian in-system
      b. These lifeforms are intelligent and know about humankind,
          but haven\'t been able to figure out any way to contact us
      c. They have finally found a method to communicate with humans
          and are dying to try it out
      d. Our PC\'s are the first ones to come along and end up being
          the \'guinea pigs\' for these aliens (it will happen during
          the fuel-skimming)
      e. PC\'s get to deal with the aliens and their \'method of
          communication\'
  I. Scenario #7 - \'Space-diving\' (8 pages)
    1. One of the NPC\'s aboard the Tukera ship is a member of the
        ISRA (Inter-Sector Re-entry Association), a club similar to
        today\'s parachuting clubs except these guys jump from space
        using atmospheric re-entry kits
     2. The PC\'s will be talked into participating in a jump by this NPC
      a. If they seem reluctant to try this, another NPC who just
          recently tried this for the first time (and who seems like
          a very rational sort of individual) can help in coaxing them
         i. Empasize the safety of the technique and equipment
            (1). Do up an equipment sheet on the re-entry kit
    3. Equipment can be rented at the ISRA club-house located near
        the spaceport
      a. The PC\'s equipment is designed and set-up for
          first-time/beginning space-jumpers and is equipped with
          numerous fail-safes/extra margins of safety
         i. These re-entry kits would be top-of-the-line, very
             expensive units if purchased, but the ISRA club makes
             good money off rentals with these so that the cost is
             made back easily
    4. This should be a fairly safe activity - potential problems
        might include:
       a. Equipment failure - should not be catatrophic
          i. minor burn-through in the heat shield
             (1). There is an extra thickness of foam on the PC\'s kits,
                   so chance of burn-through should be minimal
         ii. problem with initial de-orbit burn
            (1). burn of incorrect duration or magnitude: end up
                  back in orbit - can either try again (fuel permitting)
                  or get picked up by OTV from orbit
            (2). burn starts at wrong point in orbit: end up going
                  down in the wrong area on the planet
        iii. parachute troubles
            (1). tear in one of the chutes (pilot, drogue, or main)
            (2). shroud line gives way
            (3). pilot/drogue/main chute fails to deploy on first try
                 (a). have to use a manual release (indicator light
                       will inform you of the chute\'s failure to deploy
         iv. computer trouble
            (1). kit\'s controlling computer malfunctions and ends up
                  sending you down to the wrong landing spot
       b. motion sickness
          i. offer the PC\'s motion sickness prevention drugs before
              the trip down - if they refuse, get them to roll tasks
              on whether they get queasy or not
         ii. have an emergency vomit-vac suction tube within the
              vacc suit\'s helmet to prevent suffocation (standard
              equipment with rental re-entry kits)
       c. Weather/atmospheric conditions become unfavorable
          i. need to abort to a secondary site
         ii. need to make it through the weather conditions
             (1). will probably end up off-course and landing in an
                   un-planned location
                  (a). getting back to where they can be picked up
                        could pose some challenges (meet some new aliens
                        or alien critters?)
  J. Scenario #8 - The Major Confrontaion (12 pages)
    1. This should be the climactic scenario of the Campaign,
        with everything coming to a head....
    .**************************************************************
       ...well, now, we don\'t want to give away everything, now
           do we? If anyone wants to work on this project as a
          writer, we are interested in talking to you. You must,
          however, have practical experience as a Traveller referee
          and be able to address the problems the referee will have
          in administering a scenario with practical, helpful advice.

This is post #2 on getting to know the March Harrier better.
In this post, we focus on the ship\'s Jump Drive.

As usual, ask me any questions you might have.

Special Note to Steve:  Being the ship\'s engineer, you should have a
working knowledge of the information contained in this post.  I\'ve
written it as short as possible and made it as plain as I can.  Please
read it through once or twice.  If you give it an honest go, you\'ll have
a working knowledge of the most important piece of equipment on the
ship, the jump drive.

JUMP DRIVE

The Harrier\'s jump drive is located in two sections, port and starboard,
where the airwing attaches to the hull on the cargo deck.  Fore of each
drive section is the fuel scoop and purification plant machinery.  Aft
of each section is the maneuver drive.  Engineering personnel can access
this area, on each side of the ship, via maintenance hatches on the
cargo deck.

Although the Harrier is, overall, a TL 12 spacecraft, the jump drive is
of TL 9 manufacture.  This was done for many reasons, the biggest being
(at the time of the Harrier\'s manufacture) cost.  The base price, new,
for a TL 9 jump drive, like the one in the Harrier, is Cr33,600,000.

An added benefit, since the ship has jumped out of the Aramis Trace, is
that TL 9 drives can be worked on and maintained at many more starports
around the subsector.  Originally, this wasn\'t a problem, because the
ship was designed to be locked into the 8 solar systems making up the
Trace (Aramis has a TL 12 shipyard).  Now that the ship has used it\'s
dismountable fuel tank to allow for jumping out of the Trace, TL 12
facilities are more rare, especially in this fringe area of the
Imperium.

The jump drive is finiky, like all drives of this type, and it requires
constant maintenance and upkeep.  The Engineer\'s job is never done, and
he is always busy tinkering with this or fixing that.

Brand new, the drive requires 30% of the Engineer\'s time.  As the drive
gets older, more and more maintenance is required as parts wear out.
The Harrier\'s drive was just overhauled on Aramis about 8 months ago,
and many of the old, replaceable parts were indeed replaced.

Jump drives in general are insistent beasts, and they require this type
of maintenance and overhaul each year.  Without this overhaul, the drive
has a higher chance of misjumping (meaning it can send you where you
don\'t want to go, keep you in jump space longer than normal, or even
blow up).

The Harrier\'s annual maintenance is due again in about 4 months.  The
base price for this service, at an appropriate starport, is Cr101,030.

There is a fund set up to put money aside for this purpose, called the
Maintenance Fund, and the ship\'s steward is in charge of managing this
money (Gyr).  Unfortunately, all the money in this fund has been used
for other purposes, and the saving installments are 8 months behind.

This is no problem, for the fund is set up to lessen the blow of the
overhaul cost when it comes due.  It is strictly an internal fund, and
it can be maintained or not, depending on the Captain\'s instructions.

The drive itself, both sections, masses 8 tons.  The jump grid on the
hull covers an area of 37.3 square meters.

Remember from the Starship Operator\'s Manual that the jump drive works
like this:  "In order for a starship to be able to travel through
jumpspace, the ship\'s jump drive must first open a portal into the
desired jumpspace (plane, or level of jumpspace).  To accomplish this
feat, the drive energizes a lanthanum grid which has been incorporated
into the starship\'s hull.  The vast energy flow across this hull grid
net causes an \'unraveling\' to begin in the region of space the ship
occupies.  As the discharge of the drive energies to the hull grid
increases, the unraveling becomes great enough to open up a \'rift\' in
the weave of jumpspace.

"Once this rift has been made, the starship is able to make the
\'transition\' from normal space into jumpspace.  Transition is almost
instantaneous and must be carefully controlled, for the entire fate of
the voyage is determined at the critical transition instant.  Accidents
that occur before transition make the ship unable to enter jumpspace and
simply abort the jump.  After transition, nothing the crew can do (short
of destroying the ship) will prevent it from emerging at the point in
space specified by the precomputed jump vector.

"More specifically, controlling transition involves controlling the
\'tumble\' of the vessel during transition.  This \'figurative\' tumble is
what sets the exact course and duration of the jump.  Tumble is
controlled by careful manipulation of the lanthanum grid energizing
sequence.  This instant is the most critical in the entire split-second
jump transition-many jump mishaps are the result of a faulty tumble.

"As the rift closes, the protective jump field \'bubble\' around the ship
is also sealed.  This bubble keeps out the strange physics of jumpspace
(and you say "Event Horizon"?), and serves to provide a safe region for
the ship, where the normal physics of our universe operate.  The bubble
follows the contour of the jump grid exactly, and appears as a dull,
gray, undulating \'wall\' about a meter from the surface of the ship\'s
hull.

"After about 150-185 hours, the ship finally emerges from jumpspace back
into our own universe.  Regardless of the distance travelled, the
average duration of a jump is about 168 hours, plus or minus 10%.  This
normal deviation is caused primarily by minor errors in the jump vector.
In extreme cases, this error can be far greater and has proven fatal to
more than one group of Travellers."
In the quote above, there is reference to the "jumpspace weave" or

"jumpspace level".  These refer to the various jumps known to exist.  If
you are jumping with a Jump-1 drive, you go through one level or weave.
If you are jumping with a Jump-3 drive, you go through an entirely
different, and higher, level or weave.
Here\'s a quote from the Starship Operator\'s Manual that discusses this: 

"In understanding jump drive, one must first understand \'jumpspace\'.
Following the Big Bang (some 15 billion years ago) a multitude of
dimensions existed-far more than the four which we normally perceive.
Within seconds, however, most of these dimensions collapsed into
nothingness and were lost.  From that point on, we have the familiar
three dimensions of space (length, height, width) and one of time.

"However, the era of modern physics dawned with the realization that
more dimensions than the four we know survived the Big Bang.  Modern
cosmology places the number of existing dimensions at no fewer than 62.
The vast majority of these alternate dimensions do not effect our
everyday life in any way.  Beyond the first four dimensions, many of the
others are in force only at the subatomic level, while the remaining
three dozen are accessible only via jump drive.

"The various jumpspace dimensions are described by modern physicists as
\'levels\'.  Each jumpspace level has its own character, defined by the
physical laws which operate there:  these laws are known as the level\'s
\'weave\'.  A level\'s weave ranges from very \'loose\' (easily entered) to
very \'tight\' (difficult to enter).

"Currently, there are six jumpspace levels which the major races
routinely make use of.  Each jumpspace level is associated with an
approximate distance travelled in parsecs (a parsec is the average
distance between stars), and is normally identified by a number.

"A ship making a three-parsec jump, for example, is traveling through
\'level three jumpspace\' or more simply \'jump 3\' space. Since the weave
of each higher jumpspace level gets tighter, it is more difficult to
enter level six jumpspace than to enter level one.  To date, only
misjumps have entered jumpspace level seven or higher."



2 STEPS TO MAKING A JUMP:

Here is the basic two step process the March Harrier\'s engineer goes
through to make a jump.

1.      First, there is a special, high yield fusion power plant
(seperate from the ship\'s regular power plant) in each of the two jump
drive sections (port and starboard).  This is used to charge the energy
sinks (the Harrier uses zuchai crystals for it\'s energy sinks) with high
grade energy in preparation for the jump transition.

Basically, energy is generated, very quickly, by the fusion
power plant, and this energy is stored in the energy sinks for use in
the jump grid.  This operation requires a lot of fuel, used very fast.  

The Harrier\'s jump drive uses 40 tons of fuel to do this (40
tons: picture 280,000 two liter bottles of coke). 

An unavoidable by-product of the sudden conversion of so much
fuel to energy is waste low-grade heat energy.  This heat is vented via
a series of thermal transfer techinques:  superconducting hull radiators
built into the hull, and convection techniques using some of the liquid
hydrogen fuel as coolant and expelling it with the fusion by-products
out the rear of the ship.  (During the pre-jump power build up, the ship
presents a significant IR signature, particularly from the rear, in case
of other ships picking you up with their passive IR sensors, in space
combat.)

STEP ONE:  So, the fusion plant part of the jump drive burns
this fuel in a very efficient manner, and the energy produced is
immediately sent to the energy sinks (the zuchai crystals) for storage.


2.      The Energy Sinks.  Most ships found in the Imperium use a
network of zuchai crystals as the energy sink array.  No other known
sink construct can retain such high levels of energy without decomposing
as can zuchai crystals.  However, the crystals will begin to decompose
and breakdown after two or three hours if not discharged.  In extreme
cases, the crystals can explosively decompose and do significant damage
to the ship.

Zuchai crystals are also exceptionally efficient at storing a
near perfect "impression" of the energy generated, which has both an
advantage and a disadvantage.  The advantage is very little stored
energy is lost from leakage.  The disadvantage is the power input
charging the crystals must be consistent:  any fluctuations in the input
are mirrored in the output when the crystals are drained.  Thus both the
quantity and the quality of the charge are important.

STEP TWO: Step two in the jump process is this:  Once the energy
sinks are fully charged (which was accomplished in step one above), two
surges of this energy is released to the hull grid.  The first (also the
smaller) "warms up" the jump grid by establishing a base charge in the
hull net.  The second charge tears open a hole through normal space into
jumpspace, establishes the tumble, and sets up the protective jump field
around the ship.



Two other systems should be noted, the jump govenor and the hull grid.

When the command is given to jump, energy from the energy sinks is
directed into the jump govenor.  This device, which incorporates its own
highly accurate computer system, is linked to the ship\'s main computer
system for guidance and backup.  With utmost precision, the governor
applies initial bursts of energy (about 20% of the full capacity of the
energy sinks) in the proper sequence to the lanthanum net, thereby
"warming up" the grid as discussed above.  At this point, if anything
out of the ordinary is detected, it is possible to abort the jump.

The next step, the transition phase, begins when the jump governor feeds
the remaining protion of the energy stored in the energy sink (80% of
the total charge) to the hull grid, opening the weave of the desired
jumpspace level.  Once this opening is made, the craft tumbles into the
breach and leaves normal space.



The second item to talk about is the lanthanum hull grid.  The grid is
built into the hull (which is one of the reasons armor is not possible
without completely rebuilding the ship), and it is spaced out in about
one meter grid lines.

During transition, the power fed to the hull grid is routed to specific
sections of the grid by the jump governor.  By exactly controlling (to
within microseconds) the routing of he surges, the vessel\'s tumbe is
controlled, which properly directs the path of the ship through
jumpspace.

SIMPLE REVIEW OF THE JUMP PROCESS:      

OK, here\'s a quick review of the details just presented.

1.      The jump drive power plants generate a huge amount of energy by
consuming 40 tons of liquid hydrogen fuel in a very short amount of time
(seconds).

2.      This energy is immediately, as soon as it is generate, sent to a
storing location in the ship\'s energy sinks (zuchai crystals).

3.      The jump governor is then used to manage the energy in the
energy sinks.  Two pulses of energy from the energy sinks to the hull
grid are made.  The first pulse uses about 20% of the energy used in the
energy sinks to warm the grid.  This first pulse is also used as a
checking procedure to ensure the jump grid is properly maintained for
the jump.

The second pulse uses the rest of the charge in the energy
sinks.  The jump govenor sends energy to specific parts of the grid,
making a energy pattern that will open a rift into jumpspace.  This
specific pattern also determines the ship\'s tumble and weave (course and
jump level) through jumpspace.

The jump govenor also uses the jump grid to produce the
protective jump field bubble so that the ship will be protected by the
strange physics of the other dimension of jumpspace.

4.      The ship stays in jump space for about a week as the jump grid
cools down.  When the jump grid gets to a certain point in it\'s cooling
process, the ship will naturally tumble back into normal space, at the
coordinates specified before the jump.  This is why exiting jumpspace is
not exact.  The ship\'s crew goes on "jump alert" when it comes time, but
they wait for the ship to get to the point where it falls back into
normal space.  The jump trip takes anywhere from 150 to 185 hours.  At
about 140 hours into the trip, the Captain will put the crew on "jump
exit alert".  People cannot be involved with any long term projects that
would keep them away from their station.  At some point (and only nature
governs this), the ship falls back into normal space. The crew members
make it to their stations when this happens in case of emergency, but
they basically sit there as the ship emerges into normal space.

You\'re right, of course. Still, I thought I read in a recent (<5yrs)
National Geographic or Scientific American that while the use of glass
blades is old, there had been relatively recent developments in the
technology of shaping the blades. Have you ever heard of any such
thing?

In my campaign a device called a "jump boot" can prevent a ship from
jumping. They can be fastened on a ship by the authorities or be delivered
by missiles, though missiles require a contact hit and are only effective
on ships without point defence systems.

A jump boot is a large cannister containing chemicals which expand into a
hard foamed mass when mixed. The cannister fastens onto (or hits) the
ship\'s hull and triggeres on contact or by remote control. A single
cannister produces about 10 displacement tons of hard, low density,
lanthanum-laced, foam spread over the ship\'s hull. The foam makes contact
with the jump grid on the ship and increases the volume contained in the
jump grid above what the jump engines are capable of handling. Large ships
may require several boots to exceed the jump engine\'s safety margin.
Removing the boot requires repair at a class C starport or better, or in an
emergency a few blasts from a plasma cannon.

The Marches alone contain 400+ systems. 11,000 systems is right. (NB V&V
mentions the First Imperium having 15,000 systems IIRC!)

I thought of that as well, but you need a volume of fuel equal to a
percentage of the volume of the volume you are jumping. I am not sure
whether the oceans would be enough.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I think its 10% per jump 1?

Even on a waterworld I don\'t think the thin layer of water on the surface
would be enough!


Jumping a gas giant however...... :)

I see large sums of money being thrown around but it dosn\'t look like
any of the figures take into account what resources is needed to admin 
a hole fleet of this size. 

I beleave that given the cost of admin of the Imperial fleet the amount 
of ships available would be limited quite severly, making piracy possible.
Another element is the almost ridicilous amount of habited systems in the 
Imperium. All M size stars will probably not contain sentient life and
would quite well serve as pirat bases.

As far as I know they *still* use glass blades for dissecting *cells*. 

Yes, they use microscopic flakes of glass and micromanipulators to open
up cells and do thing like swap pieces around to see what happens.

Those lasers are less than kilowatt (much less!). And they need a
moderate amount of cooling. The losses from a megawatt laser are going
to be 1000 times as strong, all else being equal. Now a *gigawatt laser
will be a *million* times as bad.

The trick is, the generator *does* have a power rating. It discharges
over a *very* short time. Divide the MJ by that time to get the power
in MW. So if it\'s a microsecond (1 millionth of a sec), then the power
rating is one million *times* the MJ rating!

ps. capitalization is *very* important in abbreviations for units!

Sorry, but those super sharp blades are TL-0! Chipped obsidian blades
are as sharp as you can get. Which is why surgeons and micro-biologists
had to get together with antropologists back in the late 60s. 

Now they know how to "flake" the glass for blades and it gets passed
on without new students realizing that this "high tech" is actually
*old* tech.

This is probably *why* there were so many survivors of "primitive"
surgery (like trephanation). A freshly chipped glass or flint knife is
*sterile* (all the edges were part of the inside of a very *non*-porous
rock until you chipped away the rock). And since it was known that a
freshly chipped edge was sharper, naturally the person doing the
surgery would use a blade that\'d *just* been chipped. 

So there goes most post -op infection. Especially when you add in the
fact that pre-agricultural tribes have *very* few diseases, because
they live under conditions that aren\'t favorable to most infectious
agents. 

A nasty ref can use the above *two* ways. First, it means that if the
"doctor" scores high enough on a roll about what to do when he needs to
operate with no medical gear, he may realize that getting the
natives to chip him a flint knife would be better for the patient than
trying to "sterilze" somebody\'s combat knife in the fire. :-)

Second, it means that some players with "cloth" type armor may get some
nasty surprises when attacked by the "stone-age" natives. :-)

Anything that expands the power of you r local nobility is good. Owning
more than one planet is good.... and it doesn\'t actually interfere with the
authority of the Imperium. Worlds making alliances between themselves are
acknowledging that the Imperium has no real effective power over them, plus
the nobles get nothing out of it. Remeber that htis is an Empire, an
enlightened empire, but still an empire!

Except in my campaign, where they are not so enlightened <evil grin>

That should have been 11,000 worlds. Sorry.

I didn\'t use 36 worlds in my example because there are 36 worlds per
subsector, but because that allows the proper proportion of all the
different population levels. However, by coincidence many subsectors
will have 30+ systems. In a sparse area there will be an average of
26 systems (1/3rd of 80) and in a normal area there will be an average
of 40 (1/2 of 80).

According to _Rebellion_ there are 320 numbered fleets. Most subsectors
have one numbered fleet. 11 fleets are "doubled up" and two fleets appear
to be in areas where there are no Imperial planets (presumably there are
client states). So without having counted them I say there are 307
susectors with one or more Imperial systems (Some of them with _very_ few
Imperial systems, though).

Cr500 isnt too bad ... assuming naval spending at 5% of GDP, that puts per

Thats 27 *new* Kinuirs per year ... assuming crew costs etc are 10% of ship
costs per year, and maintainence etc is 20% per year (wayyyyy more than
merchants pay btw), then it means we can maintain about 70 Kinuirs with our
defense budget, and retire them when they get old.

Also, if they are fighting pirates, the pirates are fighting them. And I\'ll
bet the Navy gets repaired a lot easier and cheaper than pirates do.

My guess is that worlds in Corridor pay a bit more in Naval Taxes, and brash

get onto the fast track through a taste of fire.

Actually, it\'s the total Naval budget if I read the arguments correctly.
I mean, if there isnt a war on, you might as well do an anti-pirate sweep

Small worlds get fighter squadrons ... you only need to damage the pirate
to make them go away. Six twenty ton fighters can do a lot of damage to
a pirate.

And thats buy a new ship each year. How many ships was the USN commissioning
each year when they were trying for a 600 ship navy, anyway ? What was it,
thirty at most ?

Also, check out the small proportion of the cost of a starship - even a 
military starship - that the crew is. Your average military starship costs
a megacredit per displacement ton in rough numbers, and starship crews earn
call it KCr20 000 per annum. A 1000 person crew therefore costs MCr20
per year - chicken feed compared to the cost of the ship, even amortised
over a service life of 30 years.

Yes, but the hi-pop worlds engage in forward defense on the lo-pop ones ...
look at the network of coaling stations the Royal Navy put in the godforsaken
parts of the world during the heyday of empire. A pop nine world is also
ten times bigger than a size eight world etc etc ... the Imperium is
*dominated* economically by the pop 9 and A worlds.

Trust me. The numbers work. Where there is the Fleet, the pirates arent,
unless there is a safe haven just across the border, and then we arent
talking about piracy but War.

This makes sense to me. Smaller planets will have relatively larger
moons, if they have them at all. They\'re more likely to be "binary"
satellites, like Earth-Moon, orbitting each other. It takes a really
large planet to have a true moon (where both points of the semimajor
axis of the moon\'s orbit lie within the planet).

This guy\'s cool! I think I might use him as an NPC. My PC\'s are
in need of a good pirate, ever since a certain crime family boss
had their original pilot hung up as a wall trophy (and no telling me
where I stole that from!).

A type 6 government CAN mean that the Imperium controls the planet

You can\'t make planets jump. The reason being that a planet is always

When I had my laparotomy in \'95, the surgeon used glass scalples to cut the
tiny blood vessels arounf the spleen, and then sealed them with a laser.  I
think I was the first patient of his to inquire about the discharge energy
of the laser.

I actually agree with many of your general issues.

No, I\'m claiming that the Imperium of CT is such a setting.

I\'m perfectly aware of that, and that was why I started out by using a
figure (1/1000th of the available assets) that I felt everybody would
agree was within the scope of this particular big organisation and why
I try to go low on all the estimates that I feel are questionable. Not
quite a \'reduction ad absurdum\' argument, but something like that.

Bad analogy. The proper analogy is to look at a city who has a full-time
militia of 1000 (or perhaps only 500) times as many heavily armed guards 
than they have street corners.

True, but unlike some other aspects of the Traveller Universe, this one
actually makes its plausibility check. And though an analysis of the
Imperial Navy indicates that they may be using somewhat less than that,
it can be made to conform. (Let me clarify that: If I make the assumptions
that I think are the most plausible, then the size of the Imperial Navy
would indicate a naval tax of around Cr125-133, but if I make some
perfectly reasonable assumptions (about the size of the average Imperial
ship and that jump riders are classed as non-ships regardless of their
size) then I can make it come out Cr500.)

I feel it is stronger than that. IMO it is unreasonable to assume a much
lower average income than Cr9,600.

Only on one level, actually. That of the local admiral.

For the 10th or 11th time: _The decision to pay the cost of keeping dozens 
of patrol vessels on station continiously was made when the Imperium or
the planet decided to use a percentage of their income to build a navy_!
You may not think that using 5% of each system\'s GWP on warships are a
good idea, but that is just as canonical as the pirates. In short, we
have a contradiction. Since I _do_ think that 5% of GWP is a not
unreasonable figure then it follows that IMO the element that makes
least sense is the pirates, not the warships. 

>and decide that it would be cheaper to let the pirates take a cargo once
>in a while (it probably would be).  

Every Free Trader lost can keep five patrol ships running for a year. But
that would only be germane if the decision was whether to pay taxes to
the Imperium or use the money for domestic purposes. But it isn\'t. The
Imperium gets so-and-so much. Or if the decision lay in whether to buy
one big ship instead of a lot of small ones. That is a valid point, which
is why I only wanted to use a tiny slice of the budget. I don\'t think it
is reasonable to believe that either the Imperium or any world would buy
exclusively big ships.

That I agree with, but, once again: The resources will be used anyway. 
After all, patrol ships are useful for jobs other than piracy suppression.

Without prior intelligence, actually. Yes, I do believe that pirates need
both a source of supplies and a market.

OK, so what you are saying is that your normal pirate is an ordinary
merchant who is just trying to make ends meet. He happens to have
invested in weapons for his ship, because you never know who you will
run into out there. This is something that dosen\'t exited the curiosity
of the authorities, because all other merchants are similarily armed
(Btw. how many armed merchants do you have in the US at the moment?).
He has also invested in a fake transponder, because you never know when
you may run into a target of opportunity. He jumps into a system with
his fake transponder on, because he dosen\'t want to use his own in case
he finds a t-o-o. Unfortunately, he dosen\'t see one, so he switches his
transponder over to his true identity... no, wait a minute, that won\'t
work... OK, so he _keeps_ the fake transponder signal, lands on the
planet and is inspected by the Port Captain... no, wait a minute, that
dosen\'t work either. OK, so he has his _true_ transponder on when he 
jumps in an if he sees a t-o-o he changes to the fake... OK, so he jumps
into a system with his transponder off, and if he sees a t-o-o then he
dosen\'t turn it on but begins chasing the victim. The victim immidiately
starts to run away; whatever patrol ships there happen to be in the 
vicinity starts chasing you. Your victim is either on his way down to the
planet with empty tanks or he is on his way out, but still inside the jump 
limit, because otherwise he could just jump away. So you have to chase him 
down inside the jump limit too. Your own engines are no stronger than his, 
because you are just an ordinary merchant taking a golden opportunity to
get rich, but, hey, you have almost an hour to do so before any ship can
get to you from orbit around the planet. In that time you have to chase
down your victim, either disable him or convince him to surrender rather
than risk a jump from inside the 100-diameter limit but outside the 10-
diameter limit, match vectors with him, board him, transfer the cargo
(oh, you have to ditch your own, but that propably isn\'t going to give
anybody any clues to your identity), and jump away. But wait! You just
arrived so I suppose your tanks are empty? Oh, you keep an extra load of
fuel in collapsible tanks just in case you come across a t-o-o? No wonder
you have to pirate ships to make ends meet; you\'re certainly not going to
survive as a merchant...

So I said. I also said that it would take considerably less than what was
available. I still stand by that statement.

Alliances? Oh, you mean a _gang_ of lousy merchants teaming up! 

>and the enemy having initiative and surprise.  

You\'re arguing in rings here. One moment you want the pirates to look and
behave like ordinary merchants (which involves broadcasting their
identity, mind you) the next you want them to sneak up on patrol ships
and attack them from their non-existent blind side. In space you can\'t
sneak up on anyone except by jumping in near their position. Blind.

I don\'t think the enemy was obliged to walk into a US army post and have 
his fingerprints taken twice a month, was he?

No, it is based on the position that even playing at being a pirate is
an incredibly bad idea for a merchant and playing at being a merchant is
an almost impossible thing for a pirate to do. In the Traveller Universe
you can either make a living freighting stuff from port to port or you
can jump around looking for targets of opportunity; you cannot do both.

Are you saying that they have enough ships, but the choose not to use them,
or that they can\'t afford to build enough ships? Because unless it\'s the
first, this is not a parralel to the situation in the Imperium.

All those pirates have had one thing in common: they were able to hide
either in a place where the Empire in question couldn\'t find them or in
a place where the Empire didn\'t have the assets to dig them out. And all
those empires (well, I don\'t know about the Chinese) had periods where
they did, in fact, more or less stamp out pirates for decades.

>Actually, you are being optimistic.  

No, I\'m following the rules. The cost of maintaining a warship is 10% of its
initial purchase price (in my own campaign I add Cr100,000 per crewmember,
but that\'s not canon).

>Even in our high tech armed forces salaries are a bigger cost than equipment 

But that is not the case with starships in the Traveller Universe. A Kinunir 
costing MCr1,080 has a crew of 45 (not counting 35 marines). TCS maintenance 
runs to MCr108/year. IMO 1/5th of that goes to build a replacement some day,
but that is just an interpretation (TCS campaigns don\'t usually last long
enough for ships to wear out). Annual maintenance is MCr1,08/year. Normal 
salaries runs to MCr4.5, assuming Cr100,000 per crewmember. There remains 
more than MCr80 to pay for combat pay and supplies. Even paying the 
ridiculous standard costs for life support and jumping 50 time per year only 
comes to MCr4.5 more. Paying full price for refined fuel for 50 jumps comes 
to less than MCr15 (and if you want to talk unrealisitically large figures, 
the last two certainly qualifies). And we still have MCr60 to account for any
overhead. Are you beginning to get the picture? TCS maintenance figures
are so high that they cover everything you can come up with and then
some.

I do not have to. There are 95% more of the GWP unaccounted for.

Well, no. A pirate is just a merchant with itchy fingers, remember? Except,
apparently, when you want him to be able to outfight his prey and his
predator. You keep trying to have things two ways.

There\'s that catching by surprise again. Explain to me exactly how you
would go about ganging up and catching a patrol ship by surprise when
you are pretending to be an ordinary merchant.

And when you correct for the points I refuted we are up to 180 Kinunirs.

No, my naval budget is 7,500 MCr if i have 15 million inhabitants. As you
point out the proper average is 50 million, so the actual budget is
17,500 MCr. Which comes to 120 Kinunirs. Or 24 Kinunirs for a system
with 10 million inhabitants.

Not if I follow the rules. Now, if you can demonstrate that the rules are
implausible then I will be happy to use some other, more reasonable,
rules. But as far as I can see, the 10% of price maintenance rule err to
the other side by being quite a bit too high.

>You also have give some to the army and then the larger percentage of 
this is going to be grouped to form fleets of decent size, 

The larger percentage? That sounds like you\'ll allow me several percent
for my patrol ships. Gee, that will really allow me to cover all the
systems like a coat of paint. How big a percentage would you say was
reasonable?

>some of which will be sent to the front lines.  If you take your assumption

Well, i\'m not afraid to admit it when I have been too optimistic. I may
have to ask for another 1/1000th.

>goes to ships rather than salaries (which is optimistic) then your pop 7

All my money goes to fighting units in the sense that I get a fleet equal
to 10 times my yearly budget. I then pay 10% of purchase price per year
in maintenance. How much of that goes to maintain the ships and how much
to salaries I don\'t really know. There is plenty to go around, though.

No, they are supposed to be a main source of fuel, but unfortunately the
economic system and cold common sense shows that they would not be.

It would be a given if it made sense, but what I would have to change 
would be either the rules of economics or basic human nature, so this 
sort of traffic is not a given.

Sure, but a system with 3 or 30 or even 300 people are much less likely
to be spread out across it.

Traffic to and from the system will refuel at the starport if at all
possible. Traffic trough the system likewise (if nothing else less time
is spent flying down to a normal world than to a Gas Giant)..

Why? If the traffic is low very little time, if any, is lost and if traffic
is heavy it is also a very worthwhile place to have patrol ships.

Not really. As has been pointed out, even if the patrol is in orbit around
a world it can get out to help in less than an hour.

No, I assume that they can\'t jump in a long way from the patrol ship and
then sneak up on it. How would you sneak up on a ship in space? It can\'t
be done.

I agree 100% with you David. I, too, would prefer to have a Traveller
Universe with pirates. Unfortunately, when you reality-check the two
basic elements, the amount of resources a world can generate and the
difficulties of being a pirate in a universe with that amount of armed
warships, it\'s the pirates who fail the check and the taxes that makes 
it. So what I usually do is ignore the conflict and hope my players
won\'t object (they are pretty good about that sort of thing (though I
have my problems with them over the flat galaxy)). But the fact that
I ignore the discrepancy (and would, indeed, reccommend that you do too)
has nothing to do with my opinion that there is, in fact, a discrepancy.

MT Referee\'s Companion, pg 28, has mobile planets via jumpspace and

But buying 27 new Kinuirs means that the Imperial Navy has not used any of
the Naval Budget for admin. This is just plain silly. About half or more
of budget will go to paying admirals, officers, desk clerks, office
buildings, computer systems, computer experts, naval ports, naval depots
and so on. When I think of it I guess only about 5% to 10% would be
available for new investments into ships, buildings, camps, depots.
Much of this will be supply ships, troop carriers and so on. That leaves 
say 1 to 2% for fighting vessels. Now that isn;t a lot.

Cheap repairs means that you would need a yard, more money from the budget
to its employees, admin andso on. Less money is available for fighting the 
pirates.

But having a fighter squadron in a system means that they have to have a
base, base personell, refuel depots, sensor satellites and so on. Large
ships can operate more independently and therefor IMO will totally be the 
cheaper.

But the support crew is tremendous. Think of what it takes the US Navy in
admin personell to keep tabs on their fleet, compare this to 11.000
worlds. The personell needed to coordinate this is tremendous when you
take into consideration the one week lag in jump communications.
This is where most of the money is disappering. Admin!

But there is no way in hell that the fleet can be everywhere, because then
they need depots, ports, support lines, support personell, desk clerks and
on and on. This is going to drain the Imperial Navy Budget like a black
hole. I really think that large world will protect themself and the worlds
they consider important to trade and planetary security, the others are
out of luck.

What you missed is that the Emperor dosen\'t buy a new set of ship each
year. Initial TCS fleets are equal to 10 times the annual budget, not
to the budget.

Ehh... since starport capacity is proportional to population size and naval
budgets likewise, the exact figure is immaterial. The point is that the
starports available can handle more than twice the work its own naval budget 
generates.

And less than Regina alone. What\'s your point?

OK, and have you calculated the naval budget of the Marches and compared

On the average the three high-population systems in each 36 will account
for about 99% of the whole naval budget. Everything else is pretty much
irrelevant, except that the pop 7 and pop 8 worlds can propably defend
themselves against pirates.

Since there are canonical examples of 100 year old ships still in service,
I\'d say that the figure is too high, but even if you insist on replacing
ships every 40 years (that\'s how long a bank is _certain_ that a ship will
last (barring accidents)) you still don\'t get much more capacity used up.

Well, in my own campaign I cut down the figures as much as I can (my pop-9
worlds only use 1/2 or less and my pop 10 worlds only 1/4 or less), but 
going by canon these are the proper ones.

_Regency Sourcebook_ contains notes for some of the planets with gov 6
with information of which planet owns them. And there was planet in
Trin\'s Veil Subsector that used to be run by another planet and 
rebelled and joined the Imperium on its own.

Correct me if I\'m wrong but wouldn\'t the planet only have to travel to the 
stars 100 diameter limit. Any self gravitational pull is irrelevant to
jump or large wouldn\'t large ships have just the same problem.

Hm, OK - the -5 supports that interpretation - but then, why write 2D+3D

Never!  How could you SUGGEST such a thing?  DGP books were always

Well, you can always do that - but of course computers aren\'t very good
at it, and sometimes it\'s fun to just let chance decide.  Last time I
left it to Lady Luck, I got a religion with more than 100 billion
adherents...

Could be interesting.  Religions are a bit like Psionic Institutes to my
mind - a minor bit of background that can suddenly take on huge
implications for PC activity.

What additional details would a religion need apart from a name, the URP
and whether or not it was a state religion?  How about number of
variants, like Protestantism/Catholicism or Sunni/Shi\'ite)?  Each would
need it\'s own URP, of course, but could be similar in many places.

Perhaps the author of each religion could pick out a couple of details
to individualise it: a unique tradition or initiation ceremony, the fact
that it\'s sponsored by a major corporation...

No, I took income after taxes (Imperial and planetary) and assumed that 25%
in taxes wasn\'t unreasonable. The planet takes 25% in taxes of which 1/5th
will be used for naval purposes. Some of it (70% according to the rules)
is used by the planet; the planetary army may or may not come out of that.
30% goes to the Imperium. The remaining 4/5th of the taxes I don\'t know
about. The planet may use all of it or they may pay some more of it to the
Imperium to support the Imperial bureaucracy. The rules dosen\'t say.

Note that using PE I can come up with more precise figures for what goes to
what, but I haven\'t done the calculations yet.

I thought that all systems, ie stars with planets round them were mapped
in Travller. The ones not populated having UPP\'s of X...000-0 (insert
anything you like in the dots) which would mean that most systems in
Traveller are inhabited (1110 anyway).

IMHO, the planet\'s gravity field would not be the problem, as it is
generated _inside_ the jump field (as are Inertial Compensation and Floor
Fields on ships).  You\'d have to watch out for the solar gravity field
tho\'.  Additionally, I don\'t think fuel would be that big of a problem
for the first jump, as long as the planet had a hydrosphere of at 
least [intended jump].  Could be a problem for subsequent jumps tho\'...

mountain range will disrupt the primary field for J-space insertion -

But a smaller planet is less likely to *capture* a moon, and more likely to
be pulled apart over geological time by the stresses of the moon.

For moons formed from the parent planet, the smaller planet is more likely
form a smaller moon since the "leftover" materials circling the parent
equatorially would be proportional, therefore smaller in absolute terms.

There must be something basic I am missing here.

The MT Games 1 and 2 by Empire have character generation systems 
in them. I am not sure exactly which system they use (CT or MT) it is 
a while since I had them up but they can be picked up rather cheaply now 
that they are so old.  And on CD.  Maybe someone has them on the net 
but I have not seen them so far. 

If you do play the games be careful of the solar system movement system

The problem is not lack of places to put a base, but rather that to
operate, pirates would have to attack merchants in well-patrolled systems.
One of his main contentions that the Imperium easily has the resources
necessary to keep pretty much all member systems well patrolled.

I\'ll throw my opinion out. I think piracy would be possible within the
Imperium, but only in special circumstances. You will have isolated acts of
piracy. Not pirates living off the booty of raids, living the pirate
lifestyle. Rather, you would have singular incidents, more along the lines
of hijacking than the "heave to and prepare to be boarded" type. Actually,
it would seem to me to be easier to just steal the stuff on the ground ...

Of course, this is in the stable Imperium. The shattered Imperium, the post
Virus Imperium, the Long Night Imperium -- these are completely different
cases.

I think this has been pointed out in the original thread, but since it

is 2.7 Billion.

Again, the numbers here would be 2.7 new Kinuirs per year and maintain
about 7 Kinuirs with the defense budget, vice 27 and 70. Makes quite a
difference, eh?

Fighters have basic life support and no facilities.  That means an 8 hour
endurance, which really cuts back on patrolling.  Fighters, then, whould
be reactive and no proactive (ie, they respond to pleas for help, not
patrol to deter the pirate activity).  They would also be limited to a
sharply defined area of the system.

A U.S. warship has an effective life of 20 years.  In order to maintain
600 ship fleet, 30 new ships per year are required.  (For those of us in
the U.S., if you want a real look at the Navy of the future, just look at
the new ship construction figures [shudder])  With proper maintenance and
care, a ship\'s lifespan can be drawn out to @30 years.

Anything that expands the power base laterally is not good, at least not
from the view of the nobles above you.  The idea is to diffuse power at
the local level (i.e. you grant specific powers to specific people who
report to you), but not let the power get concentrated in any one area
(where it might come back to bite you).  So instead of giving one of your
barons authority over two worlds, you grant a fiefdom to a new baron.  As
a Duke, you still retain the power flow from both fiefdoms, but neither
Baron alone can challenge you.

Dave is correct.  According to Marc in a lately reposted message neither IG

IG has exclusive rights to the "Authoritative" printed rules.  Sweetpea has

   Just a quibble (I don\'t think it changes your argument much); the 
   Department of the Navy of the USA (a rather more militaristic than
   average civilized nation) spends about 1% of the USA\'s GNP.  Total
   military spending in the US is about 3%.  (Total federal spending
   is 22%; the state and local total spend somewhat less, 18% or so.)
   I think your 5% number is really high.

   And yet rationalizing j-torps is easy compared to rationalizing

   According to TCS, about 10% of the up-front cost of the Kinunirs
   per year goes to support.  Realistically, this number may be a little
   low, but it is not ridiculously so.

   US warships spend about 30% of their time at sea.  Trav merchant ships
   spend 50% of their time in space.  So your total fleet may need to be
   2 to 3 times larger than your `ready\' fleet.
   
   As for the cost of maintenance and support and bases and everything
   else, TCS uses a 10%-of-cost-per-year figure.  Compare to the modern
   day US: The cost of our fleet\'s ships is something like 400 to 800
   billion dollars.  The annual budget for the entire Department of the
   Navy is about 80 billion dollars (fiscal years 1996 and 1997).  So the
   modern US would use a 10% to 20% figure which is not necessarily
   incompatable with the TCS figure.
   
   Here are some stats that might interest you economics wonks if
   you\'re interested in comparing and contrasting to 20th century 
   America (which is not necessarily a good model of a 57th century
   feudal empire).

Could be.  But if I was interested in having a "main religion"
for a planet of gov\'t type not D/E, I basically just started
picking what I liked, rather than randoming.

Incidentally, Gov D/E aren\'t the only govs where you can have a
state religion; many European countries have state religions
(most notably the UK, with the official Church of England).  The
distinction between D/E and others is that in the case of D/E,
the church _is_ the state, whereas in others it may be the
official religion (for determining movable holidays, for
instance, or a required profession of faith for holders of
certain public offices) but not mandated among the populace as a
whole, and without the church interfering in secular affairs.
Iran is a D/E; England is not.

I like this idea!  Go for it, and start getting the other BITS
101 series available in the US.

Recommendations: (1) include URPs for some of the major Terran
religions of the 20th century.  (2) in addition to the URPs for
all n! religions, summarize in words, and describe specifics of
ritual/liturgy, organization, holy days, liturgical calendars,
and so on.

    'body' => 'Some addenda that didn\'t make it into the first draft, but ship designers
might be interested in:

Sensor Options:

High or Low-powered active sensors.

Active sensors may be designed to trade off required input power for size - 
achieving greater sensitivity in a small package by use of a higher-powered
beam, for example. High-power active sensors of a given sensitivity have
the price as a normal sensor of the same sensitivity, but the designer
may decrease the surface area
by any factor between 2 and 5, increasing the power consumption by the same 
factor.  High-power sensors have a volume of 10m3 per m2 of area.

Similarly, low-power active sensors decrease the input power by a factor of
2 to 5, increasing the surface area by the same amount. Low-power 
sensors have a volume of 2.5 m3 per m2 of area.


Continous sensor formula (handy for spreadsheets):



Mathematically inclined users can calculate the area of sensors of arbitrary
sensitivity by using the following formula:
Area = Base Area * 100 ^ (sensitivity-13)   (the ^ signifies exponentiation.)
The base area is found on the following table:

TL	PEMS base area	AEMS base area	
8			   50,000
9			    1,000
10-11 		2	    5,000
12-13		1	    2,500
14-15		0.5	    1,000

The minimum diameter and firing range (for PEMS) is taken from the nearest
PEMS on table 198. Sensors may not be constructed with greater or lesser
sensitivity than those on Table 198 and Table 201 at a given TL.


Exotic Sensors:

	There are three types of exotic sensors available: Neutrino sensors,
Gravitic Sensors, and Neural Activity Scanners.

Neural Activity Scanners detect and classify life forms based on brain
activity. They are extremely short-ranged, expensive, and fragile.
At each TL two basic models are available - a lightweight (portable)
model and a somewhat larger ranged device.

TL	Range	MW	Vol	MCr
13	0.010	0.004	0.002	0.02
13	0.100	40.0	50.0	20.0
14	0.050	0.005	0.002	0.02
14	0.200	50.0	50.0	20.0
15	0.100	0.006	0.002	0.02
15	0.400	60.0	50.0	20.0

Range: Typical range in km
MW: power required in MW
Vol: volume in m3. All NAS mass 2 tonnes per m3 
Antenna area (m2) = MW x 100

Neutrino scanners attempt to detect neutrinos emitted by nuclear power plants.
Pracitcal high-efficiency neutrino sensors are made possible by the 
increasing mastery of nuclear forces at TL12; however, they are generally
too short ranged to be useful in starship combat. In addition, they function
only as scanners - dececting targets but not providing a precise enough
position for fire control. 

Neutrino scanner volume is given by the following table:

Sensitivity	Volume by TL			    Typical Range
		12-13		14-15
8		10.0		5.0		    	50 km	
8.5		50.0		20.0			160 km		
9		500.0		200.0			500 km
9.5		50000.0		20000.0			1600 km

Neutrino scanners mass 2 tonnes per m3 and cost MCr 5/m3. They require
0.1 MW per m3. They require no surface area.

For detection purposes, neutrino signature can be calculated by totalling 
the power of all nuclear
(fusion, fission, and fusion+) power plants on the vehicle and comparing
to table 13. At TL13+, power plants can be constructed with neutrino
shielding. Neutrino shielding requires 0.1 m3 per m3 of power plant
volume, masses 1 tonne per m3, cost MCr 1.0 per m3 and require 0.01 MW
per m3, and reduces the neutrino signature by 1.0.



Gravitic scanners detect both static gravitational fields and gravitational
radiation. The ability of grav sensors to detect
static fields is limited to strong fields or anomalies such as those caused
by large mineralogical anomalies, or large astronomical objects.
Their ability to detect graviational radiation, however, gives them
some sensitivity to the gravity waves produced by thruster plates and
contra-grav propulsion. Like neutrino scanners, they are not accurate
enough to provide a fire-control solution, and are somewhat short-ranged.
Despite the impressions of certain science-fiction authors, gravitational
radiation travels only at the speed of light.

Gravitic scanner volume is given by the following table:

Sensitivity	Volume by TL			    Typical Range
		12-13		14-15
7.0		 ----		0.01			 5 km
7.5		 0.5		0.05			16 km
8		 5.0		0.50		    	50 km	
8.5	       100.0		5.00			160 km		
9	      5000.0		100.0			500 km
9.5	    500000.0		2000.0			1600 km
10.0		----		200000.0		5000 km

Mass is 2 tonnes per m3. Price is MCr 8 per m3. Power required is 0.01 MW
per m3. Antenna area is 0.5 m2 per m3.

Gravitic sensors operating on a planetary surface or on a ship with
active thruster plates have their sensitivity reduced by 0.5

The gravitic signature of a vehicle may be calculated from the following
table:

    Thrust (kn)                Signature
          1 -           10      -2.0
         10 -          100	-1.5
        100 -        1,000	-1.0
      1,000 -       10,000	-0.5
     10,000 -      100,000	 0.0
    100,000 -    1,000,000	 0.5
  1,000,000 -   10,000,000       1.0
 10,000,000 -  100,000,000       1.5
100,000,000 -1,000,000,000       2.0

(As a rule of thumb, thrust in kn = (G-rating)*(size in Td)*(100.)
Vehicles propelled by contra-grav instead of thruster plates have their
signature reduced by 0.5.

Sensors (page 72-74):

	See instead the "Definitive Sensor Rules" by Bruce Macintosh
(http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/house/sensor.rules.html.)
In particular, active sensors no longer use twice
the range factor, but instead use a modified detection chart.
The range factors given in the examples should be increased by 6. 

Sensor Options: Folding arrays: ignore the "double the volume." 
Instead, folding arrays multiply the cost by 1.2 and reduce the required 
surface area to 10% of normal. Note that the spacecraft cannot evade while
the folding array is deployed. At TL10+, PEMS arrays can operate while
folded, at a penalty of -1 to sensitivity.

Passive Sensors:

Resolution: Resolution is in meters. To calculate resolution
at any other distance, use the following formula:

	resolution = R * (D/50000km)
where R is the resolution given in the table and D is the distance
in km.


Active sensors: delete "twice" in "twice the range factor".

Vehicle Active Sensors:
(see new table below.) Note that TL6-7 active sensors are missing
and will be added later. The only TL6-7 passive sensors available 
are those in the "Portable Visible and Infrared Light Sensors" table.
Rules for specialized TL-6 and 7 trackers will be added later (but
will only rarely be used, since there are no TL-6 or 7 beam weapons
to require fire control.) 


Jammers: 
Active sensor jammers are divided into two types, "area jammers" and
"deceptive jammers". Detailed rules will appear in the next edition
of the Definitive Sensor Rules.

Area jammers blanket an entire region with electromagnetic
interference to reduce sensor sensitivity.All sensors within a 
active jammer\'s range and in a 30 degree arc from the jamming ship have their
sensitivity reduced by 0.5 for both detection and fire control.
Area Jamming enemy sensors is a Staggering task,
reduced one difficulty level for every tech level the jammer exceeds the
sensor (One DM for every two tech levels in TNE.) 
Jamming sensors one TL higher is an Impossible task; sensors more than
two TLs higher cannot be area jammed.

Deceptive jammers protect a single ship by attempt to mimic 
radar/AEMS signals hitting the jammer-equipped ship to disrupt fire control
locks (but not detection.) 
Fire control locks against a ship equipped with
a deceptive jammer, by a sensor within that jammer\'s range, 
have sensitivity reduced by 0.5. Deceptive jamming is a Formidable task,
recuced one difficulty level for every tech level the jammer exceeds the
sensor (One DM for every two tech levels in TNE.) 
Jamming sensors one TL higher is an Impossible task; sensors more than
two TLs higher cannot be area jammed.


Passive sensor jammers also operate to prevent fire control locks.
(The name is something of a misnomer since they actually do emit radiation.)|
Fire control locks against a ship equipped with
a passive jammer, by a sensor within that jammer\'s range, 
have sensitivity reduced by 0.5. Deceptive jamming is a Impossible task,
recuced one difficulty level for every tech level the jammer exceeds the
sensor (One DM for every two tech levels in TNE.) Passive jammers can only
be used against sensors that have been detected by the jamming ship.
Sensors of higher TL cannot be jammed. The next DSR edition will include
rules for using passive jammers to blind or decieve enemy sensors (generally
only possible for sensors of lower TL than the jammer.)

Decoys: Active sensor decoys and LIDAR decoys are also available. They
require 0.1 m3 per m2 of the ship\'s surface per decoy bundle, mass
2 tons per m3 and cost MCr 5 per m3. The launcher rquires 0.01 m3 per m2 of
surface area, masses one ton per m3 and costs MCr 0.1 per m3. 
(Seperate decoys and launchers are required for active sensors and LIDAR.)
They reduce the signature of the deploying ship by 0.5. Decoys of all types
are only effective against sensors of equal or lower tech level. Successfully
operating decoys is an Impossible task,
recuced one difficulty level for every tech level the jammer exceeds the
sensor (One DM for every two tech levels in TNE.)
TL6-7 decoys cost one tenth as much as normal decoys.

You might wish to reconsider this after looking at the cost of the vessels
per crew member.  From my reading, it seems like traveller ships tend to be
fairly large by Earth standards, and fairly sparsely crewed.

On Earth, ships are relatively cheap.  There are scads of crew members, and
scads of support people at the home base, per dollar of vessel.

In the CT universe, ships cost a LOT of money, and are very, very large,
compared with the amount of cargo they hold, and the number of people on
board.  This is why piracy and bulk cargo transshipment is so silly in the
Trav universe - any pirate could sell the ship for a tenth of its real
value, and still retire happy.

Look at the recent post by Hans, in which he demonstrated that the 10%
maintenance figure used by TCS leaves a healthy amount of money left over
each year, even after salaries, maintenance, and every other expense he
could try to add.  This could pay for legions of support personnel.  I seem
to recall him saying that a typical Kinunir would have some 60-70 MCr left
over, or something like 6000 support personnel per 1200 ton ship.  (Sorry
if I misquoted...)

I am trying to call various shipping companies to find out what a modern
merchantman costs, just to see if my model is right.  Anyone with real,
recent data is invited to let me know.

You could also use a grav sensor to notice passing laser fire, no?
(assuming the grav pulse focussing is in effect)  This might be a
way to at least get a heads up that somebody is shooting----or it
might trigger sandcasters to fire on the premise that the first shot
will rarely be the one to hit...

Well, I might say something about the psychological impact of large

OK, here they are.  (I have to put this into a database so I can quit
crunching the numbers by hand each time I do this!)

[Note - my system for calculating population is to assume the pop code
range goes from half below to half above.  (ie. Pop Code 4 has a range of
500 to 5000)  In this way, the code is equal to the average population.  I
am not stating this to start any dispute, simply so you will know how I
get my numbers.]

Assumption - Shipyard capacity = 1 ton per 1,000 pop. per week

Spinward Marches 

TL 9 shipyard capacity @ 10,110.01 tons per week
	1 shipyard @ .01 Tn/wk
	1 shipyard @ 10 Tn/wk
	1 shipyard @ 100 Tn/wk

	2 shipyard @ 1 Mt/wk

TL G shipyard capacity @ 100,000 per week
	1 shpyard @ 100 Kt/wk (Darrian, had to put it in!)

Total shipyard (Class A) capacity is 6,163,695 (plus change) tons per
week.  However, 2,251,385 of that capacity is TL B-, which IMHO, would
be...underutilized for the Imperial Military.

Almost a full third of the capacity is held by two starports, Rhylanor and
Trin (which I missed on my listing of TL-F Pop A starports, ref: my
previous post)[which is also why the Imperials consistantly kick ZHO
BUTT!!  :)

Now, starting with the figures given above, who wants to figure out how
much of this shipbuilding capacity is used by the Imperial fleets based in
and around the Spinward Marches?  (I\'m not!!)

Flying Sex-Toys of the Shattered Imperium (name given to the book by an
ex-gf who games-- look at the cover) isn\'t going to tell you much about the
Tigress (the ultimate Happy Fun Ball/Space Pac-Man) or the Plankwell;
they\'re from Supplement 9, Fighting Ships.

According to this tome, a single Tigress cost MCr. 362,721; and a Plankwell
will set you back MCr. 120,494.

Thanks for the info!  The Heavy Fighter THUDDD will be a 3I naval design,
at TL 12, 20-50 dt, optimized for performance with cost a secondary

That was because the points were quite small and fit through the rings,
not because of any great advantage of glass points...glass is still softer
than steel after all.

Ordinary metal hunting crossbow bolts will go through cloth-type armor,
which is only effective against relatively blunt objects in real life.

Cloth _might_ stop field points, but I certainly wouldn\'t want to be in
the armor trying.

Calculate the gravitational field produced by even a massive starship, and
compare to the attraction the Earth has even at 100 diameters.  I think,
playing a game in which planet-hopping is so easy, that we often forget
just how big the durn things are....  :-)

	And a ship is always within 100 diameters of itself ... so\'s an asteroid,
and those are canonically used for jump-capable vessels...

	If the question came up in one of my games, there\'s several ways I could go:

	1. It\'s not actually the total gravity that matters (since 100diameters
from a size-0 world will be at a different gravity level than a size-8
world), but the gradient. But this answer doesn\'t immediately address the
question ...

	2. It\'s the gravity field that _intersects_ the jump field surface that
matters. Specifically, it\'s the field impinging from the outside, since the
jump field cuts the interior off from the rest of the universe. So a planet
should be as jump-able as a planetoid ship as a scout ship ... if you\'ve
got the money, materials, and fuel, AND you can accurately place a grid
over the entire planet such that no point on the planet is more than 1m
away from the gridlines ...

	3. BOOM!

		3a Jump-drive sized boom
		3b Planet sized boom

	4. Where the ^&%*&^% did we end up (puke)?

	
I\'d probably go with a mixture of 1 & 2 ...

>They tend to make all their rolls from only two or three tables.

Off the cuff, I would say that it would make a big difference.  This limits
the total number of skill picks down to 12 or 18, rather than the 36 I
simulated in the first table.  If they pick the majority of their skills
off three tables, this is the equivalent  of the "skills are in the charts
two times," and if they pick them off two tables, it is like the "skills on
the tables three times" numbers.

Thus, allowing the tables to be selected will produce dramatically higher
skill numbers.

As Andy Lilly pointed out, cascade and cluster skills also change the
outlook, as they allow certain skills to be represented a number of times
on the tables, in a non obvious way.  For example, if Pilot and Space are
both on the table, one can get pilot a fairly large number of times.

FWIW, I am using a different arrangement, wherein I have replaced virtually
all of the skills with the various cascades, so the player rolls randomly
for whether they get a stealth, ship, academic, combat, technical, or
physical boost in any given year.  Once they know that, I leave it up to
them what skill they get, with a few provisos about availability.  Since I
usually let people design their characters anyway, this works fairly well.

I used this Monte Carlo as a way to determine how many skills an undesigned
person should get.  I assume that the skill charts are more accurately
representations of how an "average" person goes through the services, with
few people actually being the average.  By generating actuarial tables, the
Scout service can see, for example, how many high pilot skills they have,
and then decide to adjust the percentage of Scouts accepted for the "pilot
refresher" course up by 3% next year.

I couldn\'t disagree more.  The main difference is that the presence
of j-torps would fundamentally alter how the Imperium works while
piracy could be dropped out without a big deal of difference.

Then, across the rest of the label is a signature - \'Marc W. Miller\'

My question:  do you know anything about this copy of the game, and why
your signature is on it?

(Also, I picked up a copy of the Spanish language Traveller hardback.  An
incredible work of art.  Wouldn\'t it be nice to see the T4.1 hardback
looking like that?  With color counters and slipcover - Wow!)

281 Subsectors is only ~17 sectors (or ~4 domains) and that seems quite 
reasonable.  ....recalling map of imperial space....  Yeah - right enough.

Have you given any thought to having the numbers range from 2 to 19 so that a 
pop code 4 has a range of 2000 to 19000 and pop 5 ranges from 20000 to 190000. 
 We use this (or a varient at any rate) so that the world pops have a smoother 
range.

No, not at all.  Bigger worlds will still, by and large, have bigger moons.
 That is to say, an Earthlike body (size 8) _could_ have a satellite of
between 2 and 7...  Whereas Mercury would have a moon between size S (Very
Small) and 2...

I\'m going to stay away from the numbers for a moment, and turn around and
take it from the top.  Right now, there are several definitions of piracy
flying around.  We can\'t debate the existance of something that isn\'t well
defined...

Well, we can, but it makes little sense.

So, what are pirates in the Imperium?

Start with canon.  Some are merchants who turn to piracy during "dry spells".
 No cargos to be had.  No smuggling to be done, and a ship payment is due
next week.

I can believe this in the fringes of the Imperium.  Traders would be armed if
they were to deal with other states outside the Imperium.  Would _YOU_ go to
trade in Vargr space without packing some serious heat?  In addition, there\'s
a good possibility that Imperial ships in these areas would have bigger fish
to fry (I\'m thinking the Coreward edge of the Imperium in particular).  This
piracy scenario really depends on whether or not Imperial traders are allowed
to freely interface with non-Imperial territories.  I would imagine that this
would be really common around Antares, which I would imagine has a high Vargr
population.

The golden age of piracy.  "Argh, me hearties, shiver me timbers!".  These
are the pirates I\'d like to see.  Autonomous utopian raiders.  Highly skilled
seafarers that fight hard, and play hard.  They don\'t translate well to an
Imperial campaign though.  I\'d love it if they did, but they just don\'t fit.
 There were environmental factors that just aren\'t present in the latter day
Third Imperium (they\'re there in spades in the early days of the 3rd
Imperium, however).

The common form of Piracy.  Real piracy throughout history and throughout the
world has been traditionally based in locales that the ruling empire of the
time couldn\'t eliminate for some reason or another.  Imperial examples might
be the edge of Solomani space.  Moving in warships could ignite another war!
 The "neutral zone" of Reaver\'s Deep (named after pirates and raiders,
fittingly enough).  Here, attacking an Aslan ship could ignite a war as well,
or cause an uncomfortable "international incident".  In addition, moving
ships into the heart of the "neutral zone" to ferret out a pirate base could
be seen as an act of war.  The human client states Spinward of the Spinward
Marches are another sensitive area.  Wouldn\'t want to ignite another frontier
war, would we?  The Vegan Autonomous District could be another sticky locale.
 Granted, the Imperium could whallop the Vegans, but the Solomani in Vegan
space are known to revolt.  War can breed piracy, especially as Vegan
warships are moved to quell rebellion and generally stretched thin...

And finally there is "modern day land piracy", or truck hijacking.  Cargos
are boosted from trucks.  In the late 70s and early 80s, law enforcement in
the US believed this to be true hijacking, with weapons and violence.  It
turned out to be most commonly the driver turning over the truck and contents
to organized crime for a cut of the profits.  This is the most realistic
scenario within the Imperium.  It happens today even in major cities like New
York and Philadelphia...

Um...  I have more ideas, I\'ll continue when I\'m less tired.

As I said, I typed this late at night and was very tired.  It should actually
read 1/1000th of 27 trillion is 27 billion.  I was tired, and just read
straight from the calculator completely ignoring the powers of ten when I

As I said, my apologies to all involved.

I have a copy of _Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_, for Classic Traveller, 
and therein ye shall find the cool names for the big warships.

The Plankwell class dreadnaughts cost MCr 120,494 each, and weigh in at 
200 ktons. They are named for notable admirals in the Imperial Navy. The 
class name is taken from Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, a sector 
admiral in the Spinward Marches who rose to Grand Admiral of the Marches 
and lead the defeat of the Outworld Coalition during the First Frontier 
War.

The Tigress class dreadnaught costs MCr 362,721 and masses a hefty 
500ktons, and was (in 1107) the largest line-of-battle vessel currently 
in service in the Spinward Marches. Only one Tigress class BatRon is 
deployed in the Marches, assigned to 212th fleet, at Rhylanor. The 
Pantheress is another ship of the class.

Compared to this supplement, the FSotSI disappointed me. I was used to 
the cool names and pictures in Supp.9. The drawings in FS of Shattered 
Imperium didn\'t have the same dynamism. Each ship wasn\'t given the same 
history, just a pile of stats. Eh -- maybe it was just nostalgia of the 
fact that Supp. 9 was the very first Traveller book I ever saw. My friend 
brought it back from his trip to the UK (still has the "Arts and Crafts 
Studio, Chester" sticker on it for 2.5 pounds), and I fell in love with 
the game before we even got a rulebook. Funny, I seem to recall that we 
only got the actual Traveller rulebook later, we started playing with 
Books 4-6 and some supplements and adventures...

some way that we could generate a psuedo-lanthanium grid using charged
metallic hydrogen. Use the resources given... that\'s what I say!

Imagine the reaction of the SDB commander as he detects a gas giant jumping
into system!

I want to thank you and everybody on this list who have e-mailed me with
your condolences.  I really appreciate it.

I also want to say that these messages are not necessary (although I
have appreciated every one of them), and you need not take up TML
bandwith with them.

I do appreciate the kind words.

As a math major, he\'s got a unique way of looking at the world.  Check
out what he says about this paragraphy from my post (I used the Starship
Operator\'s Manual as a source for this section.

I said:

An unavoidable by-product of the sudden conversion of so much fuel to
energy is waste low-grade heat energy.  This heat is vented via a series
of thermal transfer techinques:  superconducting hull radiators built
into the hull, and convection techniques using some of the liquid
hydrogen fuel as coolant and expelling it with the fusion by-products
out the rear of the ship.  (During the pre-jump power build up, the ship
presents a significant IR signature, particularly from the rear, in case
of other ships picking you up with their passive IR sensors, in space
combat.)

The he responds:

Fusion gives off an extreme amount of energy.  It would be interesting to
do some calculations to see how much fusion energy is in 40 tons of
liquid hydrogen.  We don\'t know exactly how what percentage of energy
is wasted as heat, but I would guess that if it were even as high as one
percent, then most of the rest of the 40 tons of fuel is actually used as
coolant.  Maybe this is a question for the physicists on the TML.


Well, how about it TML physicists?  What do you think.


And, my player makes another comment that\'s very interesting:

Marginally related: I saw a news program recently on antimatter.  A
physics lab (in Sweden?, definitely Europe) has been able to isolate
antimatter particles for a few milliseconds.  They\'re trying to find a way
to stabilize the stuff, and then they propose that it could be used as fuel
for space travel.  Antimatter gives off a *lot* of energy when combined
with matter (just like in Star Trek).  Supposedly it would take only a few
milligrams to go to Mars and back.  The Emporer\'s Arsenal hypothesizes
the use of antimatter as a propellant for weapons at very high tech
levels (15+).

This is post #4 in getting to know the March Harrier on an intimant
level.

========================================================================

AVIONICS

Avionics includes the control systems,flight avionics, and terrain
following equipment used by the March Harrier to control her in
flight--normal space, jumpspace, and through microjumps.

Together, the various equipment has a volume of 1.7 tons, taking up
internal space.  Each of the components are manufactured to civilian
standard requirments, and, together, they use 1.3 Mw from the ship\'s
power plant.

Antennas and hull sensors take up .3 square meters on the ship\'s hull. 
Together, these control systems cost Cr9,200,000.

Normal space flight controls are typically operated by the pilot, with
supplemental input from the navigator.  Various pieces of equipment are
included for normal space flight, including the normal space nav
computer which correlates information from the ship\'s maneuver drive,
orientation controls, power plant, sensors, and communications
equipment.

The Harrier also mounts a TL 12 holotank (next to the navigator\'s
station on the bridge) used to plot three dimensional images.

For jumpspace, the controls section includes a jumpspace local CPU,
which correlates information from the ship\'s jump drive, sensors (for
stellar information in normal space), and the jump governor/hull net
systems.  This set of controls is typically operated by the navigator
with supplemental input from the pilot.

The main computer is also interlinked with all of these systems for
backup and coordination purposes.

These systems are located throughout the entire ship, and each can be
viewed as a single system.  Because they are so interlinked, they are
typically group together in one package, called the avionics section of
a starship.

The pilot and the navigator use them;  the engineer (and possibly the
ship\'s electrician and computer tech) keep them running.

Next Up?  Sensors.

of you following this thread.

This post focusses on the Harrier\'s Maneuver Drive.

Kenneth.
==================================================================

(the following is copied from a post I sent to my players)




This post focuses on the Harrier\'s maneuver drive.

This is pretty straight forward stuff, but ask me a question if you need to.

===============================================================================

Unlike the TL 9 jump drive, the Harrier mounts a TL 12 M-Drive.  The unit is
seperated into two sections, port and starboard, located in the same
drive rooms as the two halves of the jump drive.  

Total size of the unit is about the same size as the jump drive, which
is 8 tons.  A new one costs Cr28,000,000.

This drive also takes up a sizeable portion of the engineer\'s time,
amounting to 30% or about 3 hours of his 10 hour day--or about 13 hours
a week.

This drive is in the Thruster category, meaning it is a reactionless
drive.  A reactionless drive means that there is no reaction that takes
place to produce thrust, like burning fuel in rockets.  Thruster plates
operate by electrical power being juiced to them from the ship\'s power
plant.

Here\'s how the Starship Operator\'s Manual describes thruster plates: 
"Upon reaching TL 11, breakthroughs in quantum physics lead to
reactionless thruster plates.  Faster and more efficient than gravitic
propulsion system (anti-grav vehicles like air/rafts, grav belts, and
other grav cars), thruster plates represent the most modern form of
slower than light transportation to any known race."

Here\'s a short history of how thruster technology was developed (from
the Starship Operator\'s Manual).

"The gravitic drive relies on interaction with the graviton.  The
graviton, a massless subatomic particle, is the carrier of gravitational
force.

"The gravitic drive produces a field which, in effect, alters the way
incoming gravitons react with the ship.  In so doing, the grav-propelled
craft is able to use normally attractive gravitons for thrust in any
direction.  It is worth noting that this basic ability to affect the way
in which gravitons interact is fundamental to many other fields of
modern physics and engineering."

As you can see, the gravitic drive is the pre-cursor to thruster
technology.  The gravitic drive basically uses a planet\'s gravitational
force to push off of, propelling the craft in what ever direction is
desired.  Beyond the strong pull of gravity, drives of this type rapidly
fall off in efficiency.

Then comes the thruster units...

"Thrusters are somewhat more advanced than gravitic propulsion units,
but operate in a similar manner.  Their development is an outgrowth of
the combined effects of both gravitic technologies and nuclear damper
technologies.  By reacting with both the strong and weak nuclear force,
thrusters are able to produce a reactionless thrust which allows a
spaceship to move at high speed even beyond the limits of a strong
gravitational field (like a planet--thrusters can use the gravitational
field of the system\'s star to "push" off of)."

The two thruster plates on the Harrier are at the rear of the ship. 
Remember that thruster plates only have full thrust in one direction. 
The maneuver drive on the Harrier provides thrust equal to push the ship
along at 1 G of acceleration (the amount of thrust needed to push the
ship out of a 1G, Earth-like, gravity field).  

Since the plates are reactionless and operate at the subatomic level,
thrust can be produced anywhere on the ship.  You could locate them
inside the ship, if you wanted to, but there is a certain amount of
radiation build up that needs to be vented (which is why most thruster
plates are mounted outside the ship in the conventional manner as other
reaction-based thrust engines.

But, the thruster plates can be used to provide thrust in other
directions besides directly aft.  25% of the thrust can be used to the
sides of the ship, and 10% of the thrust can be used to push the ship
"in full reverse".  For the Harrier, this would mean .25 G to the sides
and .1 G to the bow (pushing the ship, aft first).

The two thruster plates on the Harrier measure 11.5 square meters each.

A problem comes up when you think of landing the ship on a planet with a
higher gravitational field than the ship\'s acceleration.  For example,
let\'s say the Harrier, with its 1G maneuver drive, needs to land on a
planet with a 2G gravitational field.  How does it land without
crashing--the gravitational field being stronger than the ship\'s thrust
power?  If it did indeed land, how would it take off again?

This is solved by the M-drive\'s overdrive capability.  For a short
period of time (usually about 5 minutes), the M-drive can be
overdriven--producing more thrust as if the drive produced thrust like a
more powerful drive.  The limit on this is 400% of the drive\'s normal
thrust (normal overdriving procedure is to overdrive the drives by 40%,
and the Harrier\'s drive can maintain this for a few days if need be--but
it should be used sparingly, only for take offs and landings, as it
makes for a lot of wear and tear on the drive).  Since the ship can
produce .25 G\'s of thrust to the sides of the plates (and thus, to the
bottom of the craft), the Harrier can land on 1G (and below) planets
easily.

But, what about worlds that have gravity higher than earth-normal, you
ask?  Well, the pilot can land the Harrier aft first, in a vertical
position, bringing to bear the full force of the thruster plates on the
planet.  Overdriven, the Harrier\'s thruster plates can provide 4G\'s of
thrust.  (If ever the ship come in contact with a planet with higher
than a 4G gravity field, the ship will be unable to land.)

The ship approaches a planet with this requirement aft first and begins
the landing procedure.  When the ship is close enough to the planet to
use its contra-grav lifters (mentioned in the first of these posts
detailing the hull\'s systems), the Harrier can use the planet\'s own
gravitational field to land normally--no matter the G strength of the
planet\'s field.

Since, out in space, thruster plates use the gravitational fields of
massive bodies to "push off from", thrusters usually use the fields of
the system\'s star(s) (a planet can also be used, but this field is not
near as strong as that of the star).

There is a limit, though, to the distance to which the thruster drive
can operate.  1000 diameters tends to be the limit that thruster plates
are effective.  After that point, their effectiveness drops off quickly.

Given this, the Harrier\'s M-drive is not suitable for deepspace
operations.  There\'s no gravitational field close enough for the ship to
use to push off from.

When the Harrier is jumping two parsecs (two hexes in the game), it has
to make two jump-1 jumps.  The first jumps the ship into the dead of
space, and the second takes it to it\'s destination.  This is possible
because of the dismountable fuel tanks installed on the cargo deck.

Out in the dead of space, the ship is basically helpless and immobile. 
The ship does have an auxillary maneuver system for this instance (and
in case the M-Drive is knocked out in space combat), but this system is
so inefficient that movement by the ship is reduced to a virtual crawl.

This auxillary system is the ship\'s orientation thrusters.  This is a
gas-jet attitude control system useing gas, sprayed out the thruster
nozzel, to turn and orient the ship in space.  In space combat, these
orientation thrusters produce so little thrust that the ship is
considered dead in the water.

There is another system for orientation control that can be installed in
the Harrier.  This is a gyroscopic system in which a unit, installed in
the craft\'s center of mass, revolve at speeds nearing one million RPM. 
The tremendous inertial force generated from the device actually allows
the starship to "push itself off" the flywheel by means of a surrounding
sphere of focussed grav modules.  Thus, the ship rotates about the gyro
when changing its orientation.

These units are very expensive, and they see limited use in commercial
vessels.  Imperial Naval architects, however, generally prefer the more
exacting orientation controls possible with the gyro system (meaning the
Naval vessels you come into contact with will have these, and will be
able to maneuver better on this level than the Harrier).

The M-Drive is one of the most power consuming systems aboard the ship. 
The Harrier\'s M-Drive requires 112 Mw of power in order to be able to
operate.

Hmmm... I just had a thought.... has anyone thought of the possibilies of
using gravitic focussing with plasma/fusion weapons. Just off the top of my
head I would imagine the following.

The range would be increased (space combat ranges?)
The focusing would reduce the cross-sectional area (would that play a part?)
The tightly held plasma would be much hotter than non-focussed plasma
(would that increase penetration?)

thoughts anyone?

Urh, for those of us who can\'t add 2 and 3?  For those who aren\'t used to

Maybe it was because the previous roll for government type \'D\' was
2D-2+..., that the 2D bit just stuck through various trials of a \'formula\'
and when 2D+3D-5 was settled on, the authors were just too close to it all

Thank you.  I have been quite surprised by the interest shown in this

This would be up to Andy Lilly, but I quite agree - you guys don\'t want to
be missing out on the 101 books just because they\'re tricky to obtain!  I\'m
sure Andy is as concerned to reach as wide an audience as anyone especially
considering the number of North American Traveller enthusiasts.  I admit to
having no real concept of the actual logistics involved in achieving this,
however.

I should also point out, perhaps, that I have nothing to do with any of the
101 books except being an avid fan of the first two, (and reviewer of them
for Jeff\'s Freelance pages) and am waiting with eager anticipation for the
recently published volumes.

Funny you should suggest this, I\'ve been having a stab at it but also
thought it might be a wee bit too controversial to be a good idea to
include.  I\'m game, but remember that interpreting URPs can be a very
subjective thing.  Just take, say, the \'devotion required\' for
Christianity.  A fundamentalist might argue that the code should be \'0\',
others might say \'4\' thinking of daily devotions, others might think \'6\'
for a weekly visit to church, and some would think \'D\'
(dedication/confirmation, wedding, funeral).  (And I\'m sure there are \'F\'s
as well!)

That\'s just *one* of the stats.  The rest can be as tricky.  (Not that that
in itself is a reason to avoid the work.)

I like the idea but this is beginning to sound like an IG supplement not a
40 page (give or take) BITS book!  Of course, you might be able to get 20
religions with that detail into such a space but I\'m getting the impression
that folk would rather have a greater \'range\' to choose from and take
inspiration from but containing less details.

I\'d be interested to hear what folk think.

Pardon the length of this post, but I think it was my turn for a longer

 I\'m still new to a lot of Internet things, so the "Undernet" and how to access it,
are a complete mystery to me.  :)

But nowhere in the rules is there anything that says selfgravitation is 
an issue. Only external gravitational wells are considered. So is still
stand by my statement above, which would make an interesting problem in

The atmosphere is maybe 100 km thick, and that\'s if you are being

Actually, you should be able to use the ionisphere as the jump grid.
It\'s conductive and surrounds the planet. Just use lasers or something
to "super-ionize" it to improve the conductivity where you want it.

And this gives you a super aurora borealis effect, so you can\'t see
past the light show in the sky.

They\'d have to be *really* large. Remember, a planet is as much more
massive than a free trader as a free trader is more massive than a virus!

Doesn\'t matter. You see, there\'s this slight problem with "core tap"
type power plants. You are generating power from the difference between
the mantle temp (you can\'t dig all the way to the core) and the surface
temp. This won\'t work on worlds like Luna or Mars, as they\'ve cooled
too far.

Worse, if you are using "every erg", you\'ve just raised the planet\'s
surface temp to that of the mantle! In which case neither you nor the
enemy will *want* the planet.

There are actually limits on how much power you can use on a planet,
based on how much you want to disrupt the ecology (if any) and weather
patterns.

And of course, something like the massive core-taps you propose are
going to cause other problems due to the deep cooling effects. Probably
increased vulcanism (due to the mantle circulation getting sped up
*drastically* by the cooling of the outer layers) and greatly increased
earthquake activity (due to the contraction of the planet as you cool
it). 

Oh yes, there are even theoretical limits on the amount of power you
could use "safely" in open space. If theory is right, when you hit a
high enough energy density (don\'t worry, it\'d take TL 50 or so), you
could cause a "phase transition" in space time! In short, you\'d wreck
the *universe*.

I\'d want it to start with a map of the galaxy, so you can show players

It should also have provision for storing "official" data versus
"homebrew" data (so the ref can see how his version differs from the
official one) and support for multiple time periods would be nice.

I can agree with that. Of course, that means the weekend pirate\'s prey would
have the same dirves and armaments as the pirate himself, but that isn\'t the
big problem -- a 600 T armed merchant could outfight a 200 T armed merchant
(if it could catch it) -- the big problem is that the would-be pirate has
two options: He can jump into a system with his transponder on, in which case
he won\'t be able to take advantage of any prey, or he can jump in with his
transpponder off, in which case he has blown any chance of doing legitimate
business if he dosen\'t find an easy target. (Btw. according to canon it is
illegal even to install an on-off switch on your transponder; I don\'t use
that in my campaign universe, but it\'s the official rule).

Not unless they are at war.

There are two ways to suppress pirates. One is to hunt them down in their
lairs and ground them into dust. There are canonical examples of the
Imperium doing just that, but I\'m quite ready to postulate situations
where that is not possible, like some of the ones you suggested. The
second method is to always have a patrol ship close enough to catch or
at least drive off the pirate. Historically this was made difficult by
the fact that there were always far more places to patrol than ships
available to do the patrolling. A ship could only watch as far as the
horizon (30 miles diameter or so, IIRC). 

What I\'ve been trying to demonstrate is that a civilization where one
world in 36 has 10s of billions of inhabitants and 2 more have billions,
will have enough patrol ships to cover all the places. Imagine a
situation where ships can leave one harbor and teleport to just outside
any other harbor.

Yes, but the trucks are not under the observation of a police officer every
mile of the trip.

the errata not "1D-World Size".  Obviously 1D-World Size will produce
nothing but planetoids for size 6 or larger and moons potentially larger
than the mainworld for size 1-3 worlds.

Should learn how to read one of these days.

I would guess that weapons grade plasma is already pretty well condensed.
Plasmas are a strange animal (did you know it is the fourth state of
matter? i.e. liquid, solid, gaseous, plasma, (and debatably superfluid)).
They can be compressed only so far, especially since the ionized particles
in a hot gas plasma are very excited.

I would say that there is more effect in moving the plasma faster towards
the target.  Like you said it would increase the effective range, primarily
by getting the hot plasma to the target before it flys apart.

What would really help plasma based weapons (Fusion weapons are just plasma
thats fusing as it goes) is a projectable magnetic field.  This would serve
as both longer range focussing (high power magnets are certainly the
initial focussing element) and would serve to disrupt the focussed plasma
when it did reach the target, i.e. as a shield.  AFAIK there is no way to
produce a magnetic "pulse" in vacuum.  On the other hand, you could run big
coils throughout the hull and turn your ship into  one big electromagnet
the instant the plasma hit, which would put most of the plasma into a
circuit around the ship where it could cool and disperse.

I bet the magnetic power/space required would far outweigh the advantage
unless you were faced with a fusion only opponent.

Sorry that my inputs are currently so short, but work really is a *bitch* at
the moment. It\'s nice to have the added responsibilities, etc. but...

Anyway, just to answer those US enthusiasts who want to get hold of 101
books and other BITS products, here\'s the current situation:

(1) I can accept International Money Orders here in the UK but that costs
you guys extra to buy, and lots on trans-Atlantic post.
(2) I can accept US dollars cheques, provided you add about $10 to allow for
what *I\'m* charged when I bank them, plus you\'re still paying lots on
trans-Atlantic post.
(3) Jo Grant is currently in the US and is hopefully setting up a trial
system for taking orders directly while over there. However, this is only a
temporary option (he won\'t be in the US for ever), and in the long term
would still require us to transport large numbers of books to the US.

I\'m investigating the following:
(4) Printing in UK, distribution via UK to US (via UK distributor).
(5) Printing in UK, distribution via UK and US (direct).
(6) Printing in US, distribution via US to UK (via US distributor).
(7) Printing in US, distribution via US and UK (direct).
(8) Some strange combination of 4-7, other options, etc.
(9) Distribution to Europe as well!

Given the shoestring profit involved in going through a distributor, I have
to consider very carefully before committing my limited BITS funds to a
particular option.

I really do appreciate the interest that has been shown in the 101 series -
many thanks for all the e-mails. I don\'t have time to reply individually,
but as soon as the above is all sorted out, I will get back to you.

I (or an appointed representative) will be giving out details of how you can
contribute (should you so wish) to this (possible - no promises!) upcoming
BITS publication. Stand by for further communications! :-) [Please don\'t get
your hopes up - this is not a huge money-making opportunity, and at the end

This is incorrect. The rule is to generate a figure between 1 and 9 and
stick the appropiate number of zeroes after it. Personally I use a D10
and reroll any tens, but if you are an Orthodox Traveller Person you\'d
of course roll 2D-2 and reroll any zeroes and tens. In both cases, 
however, the average would be 5, five times the figures you use.

Of course, the method I would use for calculating the population of planets
in the Spinward Marches would be to look up the figures in the listings. 
And then I\'d pretty much ignore everything but the high-population worlds
except for establishing whether a world can defend itself against piracy.
  
>Assumption - Shipyard capacity = 1 ton per 1,000 pop. per week

I reccommend using tons per year as the measure and then divide all
maintenance by 50 (or perhaps 45 to allow for a 10% messup in scheduling
of maintenance).
 
Spinward Marches 
 
TL 9 shipyard capacity

 	1 shipyard with 30 Mt/year (Junidy)
	1 boatyard with  2 Mt/year (Aki)

TL A shipyard capacity

 	1 shipyard with  8 MT/year (Vilis)
	1 shipyard with 20 Mt/year (Narsil)*

TL B shipyard capacity

 	1 shipyard with 20 Mt/year (Porozlo)
	1 shipyard with 10 Mt/year (Mire)
	1 shipyard with  6 Mt/year (Gram)*
	1 boatyard with  8 Mt/year (Sacnoth)*

TL C shipyard capacity

 	1 shipyard with  6 Mt/year (Jewell)
	1 shipyard with 20 Mt/year (Fornice)
 
TL D shipyard capacity 

 	1 shipyard with  8 Mt/year (Chronor)*
 	1 shipyard with  8 Mt/year (Efate)
	1 shipyard with  8 Mt/year (Lunion)
	1 shipyard with  9 Mt/year (Strouden)

TL E shipyard capacity

	1 shipyard with  3 Mt/year (Pallique)

 
TL F shipyard capacity

 	1 shipyard with  8 Mt/year (Rhylanor)
	1 shipyard with 10 Mt/year (Mora)
	1 shipyard with  8 Mt/year (Glisten)
	1 shipyard with 10 Mt/year (Trin)

TL G shipyard capacity

 	1 shipyard with 2 Mt/year (Darrian)*
 
Of course, Darrian doesn\'t become functionally TL G until some time after
the Rebellion, but since we\'re only concerned with Imperial planets at 
the moment, it dosen\'t matter.

Total shipyard (Class A) capacity is 158,000,000+ tons per year (Note that
statistically speaking it is propably about 6 Mt more than that, but that
I can\'t prove). 70,000,000 of that capacity is TL B-, but then, if I was
buying the Imperial navy I\'d find ways to get around that.

>Now, starting with the figures given above, who wants to figure out how
>much of this shipbuilding capacity is used by the Imperial fleets based in
>and around the Spinward Marches?  (I\'m not!!)

Well, assuming the Imperial part of the 872 billion inhabitants you mention
above is 10/16th (roughly 10 subsectors are Imperial), the Imperial 
population is 545 billion. Naval taxes would be 272,500,000 MCr. Cut that
down by roughly a 3rd to reflect that some of the worlds that pay but don\'t
build have credits worth less than the worlds that both build and pay (If
you want more exact figures you\'ll have to provide them yourself). That
gives a budget of about 180,000,000 MCr. That gives you a fleet worth
1,800 trillion credits. This includes planetary, reserve, and regular
fleets. If you use that to buy system defenses (at MCr0.85 per T) you get
about 2,117 trillion tons of ship. If you use them to buy jump-6 ships
(not possible, of course) you\'d get about 3,600 trillion tons. An
average of that would be 2858,t trillion tons. Let\'s say 3,000 trillion
tons for convenience.

Shipyard utilization:
	New construction: 2.5% of 3,000 trillion tons = 75 trillion tons.
	Maintenance: 3,000 trillion tons/45 =           67 trillion tons

Total 142 trillion tons out of 158 trillion tons, leaving 16 trillion
tons unaccounted for. That\'s about 10% off and in the right direction.
Seems to dovetail quite nicely.

I *said* someone would correct me! And, if this *is* true, it makes IG\'s fate
even more precarious -- if Sweetpea hasn\'t bothered to ante up enough money to
date to allow IG (a wholly owned subsidiary, as we have been informed on this
list) to do a decent job, then it seems highly unlikely that they\'re going to do
so when sales take a dive (as I think we all suspect -- whether we like the idea
or not -- they will) after the release of the *LINE* of GURPSTrav products.

In other words, they won\'t be throwing good money after bad. In other words, it
looks like IG\'s days are numbered whether you like it or not.

	I\'m sorry, I should have explained that :) Must be those Zhodani thought
treatments...

	#Traveller is an IRC channel. IRC means Internet Relay Chat. To connect,
you need an Internet connection (which, if you\'re reading this, you
probably have) and an IRC client. There are many of these, the best
probably being MIRC and PIRCH. These can be found on various Web sites; try
a search on Webcrawler or Infoseek to find them. Once you are there, choose
a server from among those marked "UNDERNET"; use the one closest to where
you are if possible. Once you get connected, type /JOIN #Traveller, and
there you are :)

Mark, as far as I know (and, again, I\'m sure I will be corrected if I am wrong)
has nothing to do with IG per se ... Mark is, as i understand it, "FarFuture
Enterprises" and it is they who did the deal with Sweetpea -- IG is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Sweetpea. That\'s what\'s been on the list, anyway.

Since Sweetpea is the owner of IG and Mark is (through FarFuture) simply
licensing them to license IG *and* Steve Jackson, Mark will make money
regardless. In a sense, so will Sweetpea -- however, most businesses are in it
(especially in the US) these days *purely* for the "bottom line". And, if said
"bottom line" is that IG does not bring in the cash and GURPSTrav does, then it
seems unlikely that a good businessman would cross-subsidise a losing
proposition (as IG seems to be at the moment) with profits from a winning one.
That sort of thing is passe. In short, there seems to be no logical way we can
expect Sweetpea to cross-subsidise IG from SJG profits from the GURPSTrav
license.

I don\'t think we\'re connecting here -- it is not good business sense (or it
wasn\'t back in the early \'70\'s when I did my Economics :-) to take good money
(profits from GURPS Traveller license) and throw it after bad (money invested in
IG). I thinks its going to be fairly obvious that *UNLESS* IG can get their
quality control and product layout to at least GURPS standards (which isn\'t
super-high in the industry -- but is a good solid average), then GURPS will
outsell IG ... and Sweetpea won\'t take their profits from GURPSTrav and put it
towards bailing out IG ... makes no business sense. After all, if they can\'t (or
won\'t) afford the money *HERE AND NOW* to produce a reasonable product, then I
can\'t see them taking *real* profits and giving them to IG to squander.

No, it seems likely (and logical) that Sweetpea would cut their losses and
simply let IG die and take the money from GURPSTrav. Sorry, but that\'s business
sense ... you may not like it any more than I liked the business sense that
drove GDW to the wall, but its the way it is likely to be.

I have just updated the #traveller information page.  Thank\'s to Allens post 
it reminded me that I should have updated the thing before.  Basicaly the 
information is the same, but the reference to the now defunct IG site has 
been deleted.

The site is accessable via the X-TERM, the Planet-X Information Kisosk:

http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/x.htm

Click on the "Online Chat Information" icon.  there will be basic 
information on how to get mIRC and logon to the undernet.

So far the only game mentioned is my own, going on and off every Tuesday or 
so due to unseen events.  I only have 2 players, as it seemed my 3rd has 
dropped out, this game can go for 4 more.  Email me for details.

Also if anyone else is running games, e-mail me so I can put them on the 
site.  As IG no longer has a IRC server, I am making this site the 
#traveller IRC info zone, as was its original plan when I designed it back 
in January.

Hope to see you tonite!

Gak! A 18 year old still-wrapped, mint, signed copy of Belter!
Don\'t think about telling us what you paid for it! Double Gak!

That isn\'t collecting, that\'s archaeology and some freakish luck! 
Wow.

My suggestion - take it to Origins and just after Marc gets
inducted into the Hall of Fame (congrats, btw), start the bidding...
Of course, they may have trouble prying it from you not-yet-cold,

That\'s odd, since I\'ve noticed that the turn around time for my messages

This is one of the reasons that many people (me among them) don\'t like the
jump-fuel-burned-for-energy-and-used-as-coolant model and prefer the 
"jump ballast" model. 40 tonnes of hydrogen is a really, really ludicrous
amount of energy...

Other reasons include
(1) If there are these miraculous power plants in jump drives that can 
create such high peak power (albeit at high fuel consumption) why aren\'t
they ever used for anything else? (If even 1% of the fuel goes to power,
the peak power of the jump drive PP is thousands of times higher than a
conventional PP.) You could use them for powering weapons, 
for example...How about
a spinal mount powered by the same thing - it\'d use lots of fuel for each
shot but the power plant would be *tiny* compared to a conventional one.)

(1b) If the power plants in jump drives aren\'t miraculously better than 
normal power plants, why aren\'t there ships that use normal power plants
and fancy capacitors to jump? 

(2) Why don\'t the power plants (and hence fuel requirements) get better
with increasing TL? Normal fusion plants do - and if most of the fuel is
used for coolant than how much fuel you need should certainly scale with
TL (and also possibly with ship design - a small open-frame ship needs
less cooling per unit volume than a Tigress.)

(3) (Only a T4 issue): Fusion plants below TL12 are now pretty huge. Why
can you build a Miracle Jump Fusion Plant that\'s only a few tons but not a
conventional one at TL9?

Sounds like a blast. Cool scenario. I have a player in my group who seems
to repeatedly be able to accomplish such feats. Every time I think he\'s
sealed his fate, he seems to make the crucial die rolls to save his skin.

In my late, great mercenary campaign, also done with TNE rules, his
character, armed with light battledress, a fusion gun and a grav belt,
swooped down to surprise the enemy who were entering the service elevator
of a building, buying his unit precious time to get organized in the upper
floors.

Considering that they enemy was armed with gravitics rifles and a few
fusion guns, I was sure the player would buy the farm. Making successful
Difficult stealth and ground tactics rolls, he surprised them, correctly
chose the commander of the team (how, I don\'t know, but he picked the right
guy), blew him away with his fusion rifle and awaited his fate. At medium
range, it was an easy shot for the fusion-rifle armed corporal of the enemy
squad. 19! Miss! The others inflicted some blunt trauma on the player with
their gravitics rifles and the player took his next shot. Boom! Fusion
rifleman down and out! The others, having failed their morale roll,
retreated into the elevator and limped upstairs.

The player was later seriously wounded in the battle, but he survived even
after his foolhardy solo attack. Truly one of the magical moments of the
campaign.

Best,

I thought I had been following this thread closely, but your arguments against 
the use of GG for refuelling must have slipped by me.

Could you summarise again why you feel that the GG would not be available for

Better still, three *different* programs - that way, they won\'t all fall over 
simultaneously with the same problem.

I don\'t think this is really a meaningful subject - computers as we know them 
have only been around for ~25 years. We can probably imagine their progress for 
the next 25, but I doubt if we can predict what they\'re going to be like in 
another 250, and 2500 years from now, forget it. Real-time speech recognition, 
in any known language, with a vocabulary better than the speaker; VR displays 
indistinguishable from reality; self-writing, self-modifying, evolving code. 
Starship crews are little more than passengers - the ship could easily carry out 
all their tasks (excluding physical repairs, unless you have robots too) far 
better itself.

> Patents last for seven years IIRC, copyrights last as long as you defend them.

Copyright lasts for 70 years after the author\'s death (although I think the 
duration has recently changed). You\'re thinking of trade marks.

And there\'s also commo lasers/masers to consider - if they can hit a target a 
few metres across on the other side of the system, they should make a nice 
hole through a man a few km away. You might even get away with using a 
mesoncom as an AP weapon if you\'re feeling really sick...

Anybody fancy working out some numbers for this?

I heard a similar tale about a sailor doing repairs on a Navy ASW helicopter.

Be warned, the system in the rules, IIRC, indicates that a pop 3 world has
a U[1-9] distribution times a thousand people, so in ten pop three worlds,
we would expect to see one each of 1000, 2000, 3000, ..., 9000.  This has
an average of 5000, so ten pop three worlds should be expected to have 50k
people.  Under your system, they would have (if I understood it) 500 -
5000, with an average of 1000, or a total of 10k people.

(I can hardly object, as I use a U(1,5) for pop A.  I just do not see more
than 50 billion people in a single system, given the other traveller
assumptions.)

A question, though.  How do you distribute the numbers between 500 and
5000?  My rough guess was something like

8x500+1x1000+1x5000, which means that the median pop three world has a
population below 1000, even though the mean is a thousand.

An alternative would divide the standard pop code by five, so that a pop
three world ranges from 200-1800 people, with an average of 1000, and an
equal chance of 200, 400, 600, 800, 900, ..., 2000.

I do like the Traveller idea that the pop digit represents the minimum pop
of a world, but you can easily make an argument that it should represent
the average.  I might argue that equal chances of each population
multiplier leads to a rather bizarre population distribution.  Since I do
not yet have a better one, though, I will save that for another day.

What happened to the IG server?  Surely they can see the benefits they
gained from sponsoring a private IRC meeting place, especially given that
the cost of hosting a channel is effectively zero once you have a server
and the appropriate software.  *Sigh*.

Belter wasn\'t technically part of Traveller. Here\'s a list of Classic (and
more) Traveller:

/	TRAVELLER
	Traveller was initially published in June, 1977 and within the first 12
months sold more than 10,000 sets.
	Classic Traveller was published between 1977 and 1988 and accounted for =
more
than 250,000 rules sets. During that time, the basic background for the g=
ame
was established.
MegaTraveller shook up the universe by revealing the Rebellion and its
upheaval. The MegaTraveller rules set was published between 1988 and 1991.
	In 1991, Game Designers=92 Workshop undertook a revision in order to emp=
hasize
the military/ mercenary aspects of the game universe. The result was
Traveller New Era, which appeared between 1992 and 1995.=20
Traveller 4 (the latest edition of the game system) appeared in 1996.

The cost question has previusly been answered but for comparison
Scout (100 Dtons) std design MCr 29.43 in quantity

Incidently the description of the Plankwell class goes on to say

"Modular Construction: Plankwell class dreadnaughts were built using a
modular design and constuction technique which has proven cost-effective in
commercial ship-building. A central strut or keel serves as a foundation,
bracing the drives and aligning the spinal mount, while all other parts of
the ship are mounted to brackets or strengthened points along it.  The
technique allows seperate construction of the various modules (such as
quarters, electronics areas, fuel tankage, and control
areas) with a final mating of all the various components being performed
only after the drives and keel have been tested and accepted.  There was
some initial concern that the connecting points would be foci for weakness
in battle, but the losses of two separate Plankwells in combat has been
attributed by investigating control boards to strategic misdirection."

I can remember as a CT player, My character "Mac" grabbed what was left in
the ship\'s locker; a shotgun.  "Do you have any shotgun skill?" I remember
the GM asking.  "No." I said not realizing the implications.

Later I was following the other characters around a corner.  The lead
character knocked down a Bad Guy on the way around a corner of our ship
(which was being invaded by Imperial customs agents at the time...oh! I
mean "nasty Pirates" as our cover went).  I shouted "Go on, I\'ll take care
of this guy."  Shotgun, right?  point blank, Right? Can\'t miss?  Wrong.
Rolled a \'2\' (snake eyes, Perfect in T4, rotten in CT).  The GM ruled I had
simply missed after a good recovery roll (i.e. no fumble) and the bad guy
had "rolled out of the way of my shot.  So next round I shot again,  Miss.
\'3\' this time.  Arrrrhg.  GM says "He rolled the other way".

Next round I reversed the shotgun, held it by the barrel, and said "I try
to beat his face in."  Roll.  11; "What\'s your Strength", "11". "11?".
"Yep, 11".  "Well, then, his face is a bloody pulp where you hit him, he\'s
out."  "Good."

And it felt *goooood*.

        Actually, the average of the first method is probably 2750 --
        If some truly uniform spread is used (say, 1d10 x 500) then 
        the average value should be 2750 -- (500 + 5000) / 2 = 2750.

Well, there are a whole lot of Christian sects (and that\'s true
even if you don\'t include Eastern rite/Eastern Orthodox
Christianity in that statement), and Judaism and Islam aren\'t
immune to sectarianism, plus there are at least two kinds of
Buddhism, and there\'s many personal interpretations of the
requirements.  If there\'s an "official" statement that could be
used for the interpretation of a stat, go by that, otherwise,
just eyeball it based on your perception of the "norm"-in-
practice.  The Intro to 101 Religions would naturally point out
that there is a lot of variation in personal compliance with the
stated norms; this information is probably sufficient to orient
the typical Traveller well enough to avoid the most serious
gaffes - but this information should not under any circumstances
be taken as definitive.

Hmm...  I didn\'t realize that the BITS books were 40-pagers; I
somehow was thinking that they were 96ers. In a 96er, you can get
a half-page per religion, with room left over for artwork, intro,
index, etc.; I guess you\'d be limited to a quarter-page for a
40-page book.  In which case, you should have room for the
summary and maybe a brief look at the hierarchy and major holy
days.

Disk Space; Base Program is just 600k, but each system takes as much as
300k by itself.  I have 6 system files, largest is 288k, smallest is 128k,
Go figure.

For memory, minimun (according to finder) is 400k, preferred is 2000k (2MB).

System 6? Who knows (I\'m on 7.6.1) ? Its copywright 1997.  Rob?  Are you

Grav focussing pulses travel at the speed of light. Plasma/fusion bolts
travel at ~100 km/s.

Also, the field in a travelling grav pulses is only a G or so - enough to 
hold a beam of photons together against diffraction but not enough to hold
plasma together.

>The range would be increased (space combat ranges?)
For space combat, the real problem is that a pulse travelling at a few hundred
(or even thousand) km/s is just too slow to hit an evading target at 
any significant range. 

(Which is a pity - I do miss fusion weapons in space combat.)

I was reading the Comic Shop News from last week, and I saw this blurb

"Steve Jackson Games has announced that they have acquired the rights
to Traveller, the esteemed science fiction RPG, Mark Miller and Frank
Chadwick, orginal Traveller writers, will help to rework the game to
fit in with the GURPS rules system. Plans call for the design to allow
for the use of as manmy existing Traveller products as possible..."

Seems like they got a couple of the facts wrong, unless we have some of
the facts wrong.  I thought Loren Wiseman was working on this product,
not Frank.  Unless Frank is a common misspelling of Loren. :)

They also make it sound like Traveller by IG never existed.  I thought
maybe Loren or Marc might want to inform CSN of their mistake.

And, still haven\'t seen Citizens of the Imperium (even though I was charged

Well, all isn\'t negative. I\'ve just closed a deal to buy a second hand

I\'ll start saving for a "real big" telescope...if my wife doesn\'t kill me

	Have you considered the option of providing Adobe Acrobat files (i.e.
..PDF), via a secure web site with credit-card authorization? It works for
Greg Porter, for example. That\'s how I got my copy of 3G3.  AND ... if you
choose the right level of protection for the file, I can cut & paste useful
pieces into my own scenario documents, and edit as needed.

	The downside is the integrity issue (sad to say, not the most common trait
in our modern world). How many people will "share" their electronic copy
rather than have others go out and buy their own. OTOH, how many folks here
in the US can get their hands on some of these things right now?

Not much by the time I was done with them! :).

They have a few more Spanish language Traveller hardbacks, a few copies of
Bloodtree Rebellion, a copy of Tarsus, a copy of Double Star, and *maybe*
another copy of Belter.  They also had quite a hunk of TNE stuff, but,
again, not after I was done.

They also had quite a few of the older GDW wargammes.

Suz is, as I\'m sure you all realize, a mom, and that\'s a big responsibility
:) she\'s also helping with editing and stuff on those Traveller products
that her husband and CORE works on, another big responsibility. And in both
of these, she does a great job. I was not implying she was not involved

It comes with a sheet (apx 8.25in by 11.5 in) of light cardboard, the top
2/3 is printed with color pictures of numerous, standard Traveller
starships and small craft as seen from the top.  The bottom 1/3 is small
(1/2 in by 1/2 in) counters of various humans and humanoid races, in
various poses and dress.  Very nice little addition to the game.

If its OK with Marc, I could scan it and email you a copy.  Would that be
OK, Marc?

 Douglas,
I waited to answer this to see when it would show up on TML. From the time
header it looks like you posted it some time around 8:30 am on Thursday. When
I d/l\'ed my mail at 5:00 pm Thursday your direct post to me was there. It is
now 10:55 pm and the TML post just showed up ten minutes ago. The mail was
set to recieve since I got home, son that equals a delay of about 11 hours I
guess. Since I\'ve gotten about four or five posts from others on different
systems I don\'t think the problem\'s on my IPS. Since yesterday, at least I\'m
getting the TML.

My  main problem is I just can\'t wait to read what new and exciteing Toy of
Distruction Jory is going to come up with nexr! Ican\'t imagine why Famille
Spofulam hasn\'t got this guy on waivers (at least)!

	for traveller :

	where is the difference between a armed shuttle in the wilds
	called pirates and a system defense boat at the gas giant
	enshuring that you buy refined fuel and pay tax at the starport.

	Alex told the following story. The pirates had 3 motor boats
	with small MG\'s mounted, they gave a warning shot, came on
	bord, and got some money from the captain. Of of the looked
	at the Alex clock and also wants it. After a small discussion
	only the captian still had his digital clock for navigation
	reason (the ship had NAV-SAT but the crew had no need to tell
	them ;-) after about 10 minutes the pirates left.

	Now my story. When I was in africa I often had police encounters.
	They allways told that I\'ve done something wrong, and they allways
	got happy eys when offering some small money. 

	So where is the difference ;-)

	First of all the fuel is not burned as efficient as in a
	normal fusion drive. Fuel consumption is often in a 
	output = sqrt( input ) relation. So if a lot of fuel is
	burned in the jump drive, you wont have the same effectivty.

	Second the jump drive contains about 1/3 HPGs. our house rule
	limits HPGs to a maximum ROF of 25*TechLevel, this is also
	the limit of netto energy used for jump.

	In our "canon" a jump drive is creating graph pulses around the
	ship, to enclose the ship inside a event horizon. Most of the
	fuel is released with high speed to this jump bubble to create
	the inner room of the bubble (no matter/no room/boom) to prevent
	the gracitic collapse of the jump bubble.

There are a few features of the CSC Vehicle design sequence that may
unbalance the contest. CSC has an optional rule for "stacking" grav
compensators to compensate for more than the maximum Gs of a single
compensator. CSC uses this to get grav fighters with 17+ Gs acceleration.

Also, computers are extremely effective as crew replacements. A typical TL
12 R3 dedicated computer (about 1KCr) would have a Gunnery skill of 6 or a
Pilot skill of 12 (!). With these rules, why would anyone bother to have a
human crew?

Simple. Work out the power output of a rocet engine sometime. It\'s
equally ludicrous, albeit at a much lower level. The Saturn V was
generating *gigawatts*. The thing is, that power is *only* usable as
thrust. There\'s no practical way to use it as (for example) electrical
power.

So Jump drives could be a similar situation.

Again, rockets hit their maximum efficiency very quickly. So why can\'t
jump drives?

The kind of "phase transition" in question is like when the different
forces "seperated" as the energy density of the universe changed. 

So it\'s only useful as a doomsday weapon, as the result is an
alteration of the entire universe (dropping to a lower energy level,
and winding up with "different" phsyics.

They are available, they just aren\'t *practical*. GGs are too far from
most mainworlds. It takes a lot of time to go from the GG to the
mainworld. Time that you aren\'t "in port" trading, or in jump.

So if you figure out how many trips per year you make, and how much you
make per trip (and thus how much you make per year), the "savings" from
getting cheaper fuel at the GG turns into a *loss* because of the
smaller number of jumps you were able to make.

Time is money. And a GG refuel costs you *days*.

	perhaps people wonder : what is "virtual beer"

	we (alt.os.linux in march 90) came up with this idea as the
	news group growed up, and the sound to noise ratio droped
	significantly. So we came up with the idea to send virtual
	beer when a posting was construtive, and not just noise.

	alt.os.linux showed the same revers relation between quality
	and number of replies as TML. A virtual beer is a PRIVATE
	reply to the author, not increasing noise (like the aol-me-to)
	but only to show somebody that his posting was good, and that
	its stored or printed or received in mind while rotfl.

	so dont wonder when you receive a virtual beer ;-)

ONLINE.

Umm, o..k.

I find an icon that says, "click here to sign on and win a prize". so I
click.

"Cannot establish connection to server" it replies.  I click on MORE
INFO, which tells me :

MS Explorer was unable to connect to the server because either :
You clicked the stop button before the page was finished opening, or
you do not have a connection to the Internet.

(About this time I am imagining a brick wall I can smack my head against
repeatedly)

I click on HELPFUL HINTS and it says :

If you are having trouble establishing a connection to the internet,
click HERE and an Internet Connection Wizard will help you configure
your connection.

(I\'m thinking, "Ah hah!  Paydirt!")

So I click on HERE, and nothing happens.  No wizards come up to save the
day.

I go to general HELP, which turns about to be just as informative as the
rest of the messages I\'ve seen already.

FINALLY, I think, "Hmmmmm..  Maybe if I goto settings, I just might find
a way to make a connection."

So, I do that.  There is an icon (looks like MSIE 3.02) that says
"Internet".  So I click on it.  Up pops a mox with "http://www.aol.com/"
in it.  I look up, and there are TABS.  One says CONNECTION.  YIPPEEE!

Apparently all my settings and separate dial-up connections were saved
in this area sort of like bookmarks and I can choose any of them here.

Did Microsoft explain ANY of this before?  nope.  I\'ll bet they\'re going
to be swamped with calls from angry customers soon.  :)

Just a thought, but is it possible that entering Jump requires a peak power

power, the Jump drive is a different, hideously inefficient type of plant?

I don\'t know what it is with me and decimal points these days, but those
figures are, of course, off by a factor 1,000,000. It should be millions
of tons, not trillions.

And consequently:

Shipyard utilization:
	New construction: 2.5% of 3,000 million tons = 75 million tons.
	Maintenance: 3,000 million tons/45 =           67 million tons
 
Total 142 million tons out of 158 million tons, leaving 16 million
tons unaccounted for. That\'s about 10% off and in the right direction.
Seems to dovetail quite nicely.

They are available enough. It\'s just that every hour a merchant spends
travelling to and from a Gas Giant is an hour where he is not earning
money by freighting cargo from one world to another. The money saved by
not buying fuel at the starport while you\'re there anyway is by far
outweighed by the money you lose be not going directly to your destination.

(Btw. it turns out that refined fuel won\'t cost Cr500/T either. If unrefined
fuel is available at Cr100/T then it becomes cheaper for a freighter to
install a fuel purifier plant and lose the revenue from the cargo space it
takes up when refined fuel costs much more than Cr300/T.)

(And if fuel isn\'t a monopoly it will be even cheaper. Provided you can
sell all you refine it costs about Cr5/T to refine fuel.)

There will be situations where you want to go through a system without
having any cargo to pick up or deliver there, but such situations will
be rare, because while a jump-1 freighter is cheaper than a jump-2 over
one parsec, it is far more expensive over 2. Even then it takes longer to
get to and from a Gas Giant than it takes to get to and from an inhabited
world, but I won\'t swear that you won\'t save a few credits by refuelling
at a Gas Giant, because I haven\'t done those calculations. I can say,
though, that it won\'t be cheaper if there is the tiniest extra risk 
connected with Gas Giant refuelling.

I myself would suggest using a D6 to roll population for pop A worlds, but
that is because pop A worlds have far too much influence on the rest of
the universe. realistically, looking at how many people you can pack onto 
a world even at TL 8 makes it difficult for me to claim that you couldn\'t 
have far larger populations at TL 15. I wish I could.

It only matters if you are doing Character Generation or shipbuilding.  If
so, I\'d say go for T4.

All the world stuff translates into any rules set well (Its mostly

You are right, of course. However, I posted a correction.  The top figure was

repeated blows to the same area don\'t penetrate.  Or what about
fibers with different characteristics in the same weave to absorb

Hey! Watch it! He\'ll just pinch off his own universe...the only problem is
that there\'s no way you can recover R&D costs, since it\'s kinda hard to
sell them:

Hengabar: "This new FSY UnivBuster handgun is just the greatest! and only
500 PetaCredits!"

Customer, a tinhorn dictator with FAR too much money to spend, if his
wife hasn\'t spent it all already on shoes:"I don\'t know...I\'d like to see
a test firing."

Surrounding crowd of journalists and industry reps, busy scarfing down the
free chow: "MrrmmmMrrmm Mrrm!"

H: "Ok, see that quasar way over yonder...not that one, the one _there_,
projecting the 5000 parsec high holoprojection of Sir Ara....erp.Mfff
Mfff"

FSY Lawyer:"What Mr. Spofulam meant to say was that holoprojection of
absolutely no one in particular, an similarity to any being alive dead or
fictional is purely coincidental, all rights reserved, no guarantees
implied or otherwise, offer void where prohibited, Some restrictions
may..."

BANG!

Stepping over the late, unfortunate FSY lawyer, Hengabar continues: "Watch
that holoprojection." and fires the UniveBuster handgun as a mysterious
portal opens up behind him. He vanishes as a brilliant multi colored
streak of hyperlight shrieks across the universe. 

The Crowd: "OOOOOOoooooooh!"

GIANT AWFUL RENDING NOISE THAT BLOTS OUT EVERYTHING

Well, if he hadn\'t been vaporized like everything _else_ in the universe,
Mr Tinhorn dictator would have been very impressed indeed!.

See...just no future in it, no sales are possible in this cynical, "Show
Me the Universe Buster!" world of ours ;-)

	I think that (assuming you could use your j-drive that way) you would
	have a massive overload of your weapons system. You might well "vaporize
	most other ships" but you would probably also vaporize your own. I guess
	"a one-shot deal" is a pretty good description.

You and me both.  This seems to be the week for decimal point errors.

For the record, I may have spotted an error in my figures that puts me
down by (amazingly) a factor of 10.  I\'ll be reworking \'em and releasing
them to the list (hopefully) today...  :(

This sounds very much like the spinal mounted Plasma/Fusion gun I was trying 
to create using FF&S2.  In the new system the have rules to use direct 
energy input and hydrogen fuel instead of just the EPC\'s in FF&S1.  The 
problems I had were that the danged things get huge (almost 1500Std with all 
the components), the force of the blast could wreck the ship (recoil, flash) 
but the worst thing was the lowsy range.  The X-TEK "Dragonfire" gun could 
do close to 20 USD dammage, but it had a range of only 3,000km!  Mesons, 
PAWs and even Lasers are more effective.

Perhaps Granddaddy/Cthulhu figured a way to make the fusion blast go 
farther, and put it into a Man Portable version! ;->

An optional rule, hmmmm?  OK, provisional ruling:  no gcomp stacking
allowed for the THUDDD.  How would folks feel about that?

That\'s an easy one.  The Imperial Navy insists on SITL (sophont in the
loop) controls on all warcraft, for reasons of safety.  In practical
terms, this limits autopilots, gunnery programs, and the like to skill-1
operation -- basically, \'dumb\' backups for the pilot in case the latter
gets distracted.  Comments?

By the way, the THUDDD 6 voting deadline was officially set at today
(Friday 10/4) at midnight PDT.  However, given that I\'ve received only a

extending the deadline to Sunday 10/6.  *Please* get your ballots in by
then...if people don\'t vote, designers won\'t be motivated to provide all

Well, that depends on whether your goal is the reenactment of the Big Bang.

I use a quality of life argument - I have been trying to make the universe
match the following principles:

1.  Economic growth is maximized in the 100M-50G range, depending on the
world in question.  You do not want a world too small, but when they get to
large, administration costs go non linear, thus it is categorically hard to
administer a world of a billion, than 10 worlds of a hundred million.

2.  Humans do not like certain kinds of crowding as a species, and Earth is
roughly (factor of 2?) at the limit right now.  Much more crowding, and a
significant amount of diversity will go away, as people packed cheek to
jowl will not be culturally able to handle significant variation in
individual beliefs.

3.  High tech makes some previously unlivable places acceptable - by TL12,
grav cities and underwater cities easily add a factor of three to the area
available for life, so I have no problem with 15G people on an earthlike
world.

4.  Given that Mars is only a few days away with thruster tech, and you
need little terraforming in a system with cheap power, a typical TL12
system will be composed of 2-4 reasonable worlds, so populations of 30-50G
are not out of line at TL12+.

5.  Jump drive makes anything more than an orbit or two away about as hard
to get to as another system, so it is an even call whether you will build
up near a gas giant, or colonize another system.  Where this breaks down,
is that it is still cheaper to send stuff through normal space slowly than
through jump space.

6.  Colonizing is cheap, while tech growth is hard.  Until you start
hitting the crowding limits, you are going to see more production benefits
from adding more workers than adding more tech.

I would bet, though, that systems will average in the hundreds of millions,
as this leads to lots of space for the people who do so to enjoy.

As always, the above are just my visions of a possible future universe, and
I have not yet found a way to make the rules cause it.

We may have a canonical explanation for the different rule sets...  Some

Change the words "most other" to "your own" in the last sentence.  Also,
who is the different from just letting the ship get killed?  You\'ve
destroyed the main gun, have no jump fuel, and probably caused serve damage
throughout the ship.  For what?  That spinal mount isn\'t designed to take
that much energy. It\'ll most likely melt.

Why not print a 96-page book, if we have the material?  The cost can\'t be
that much more than a 40-page (OK, a bit more but not double) and to do a
decent job of a religion you need more than a quarter page.

Actually, there are various (mostly russian) devices that essentially do 
convert a rocket-like chemical burn into electrical power - often using
MHD; these are vaguely analagous to the Explosive Power Generators in 
FFS. Very high peak power, very short duration.

For the analogy to be valid for jump drives, then the Miracle Jump Drive
Fusion Plant has to be producing something other than electricity that
the jump drive needs to use to jump; it\'d have to be using the raw heat
energy of the fusion reaction somehow, which seems implausible.

Total shipyard (Class A) capacity is 61,636,951 tons (plus change) tons
per week or approximately 3.205 Trillion tons per year.  However,
1.170 Trillion tons of that capacity is TL B-, which IMHO, would be...
underutilized for the Imperial Military.  

Almost a full third of the capacity is held by two starports, Rhylanor and
Trin (which I missed on my listing of TL-F Pop A starports, ref: my
previous post)[which is also why the Imperials consistantly kick ZHO
BUTT!!  :)

Now, starting with the figures given above, who wants to figure out how
much of this shipbuilding capacity is used by the Imperial fleets based in
and around the Spinward Marches?  (I\'m not!!)

Disk Space; Base Program is just 600k, but each system takes as much as
300k by itself.  I have 6 system files, largest is 288k, smallest is 128k,
Go figure.

For memory, minimun (according to finder) is 400k, preferred is 2000k (2MB).

System 6? Who knows (I\'m on 7.6.1) ? Its copywright 1997.  Rob?  Are you
listening?

Pete

I\'m here.

The latest version of Metator is at 

www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/software.html

As far as I know the source code is not available.  At least, if it _is_
available then it was put there without my permission and is in violation of
copyright.

The system files can get quite large, especially if you are drawing maps of
every world.  There is certainly a more efficient way of saving data, but
until I start getting some money for this I can\'t spare the time to rewrite
the code.  I have tried to interest IG, including sending them a disk, even
offering the software free in exchange for credit, but not a single reply.

I have no idea whether it works under system 6.  It should, mostly, but I
didn\'t make system 6 compatibility an issue when I wrote it, so some of the
data may not display correctly (especially in dialog boxes).

OK, a few points.  You also will have ships "just
passing through", they will have good reason to
just skip port and use the gas giant.  Also, You aren\'t
saying the gas gaints wouldn\'t be used.  You are
saying they wouldn\'t be used directly (the fuel
you buy in port may wall come from the gas giant).
Finally, you are assuming that there is enough trade
for every trader all the time.  If you have a trader that
is just scraping buy and usual ends up need a number
of day to get cargo, then a gas giant might be
a real savings.

I do agree that for a standard merchant on a busy
schedule certainly would buy fuel in port.  However,
since the ability to use unrefined fuel tends to
be less common on traders, I think that is covered.

That what I\'ve always proposed.  After all, if most of the need
was for cooling you would carry something the works better
than hydrogen (which isn\'t that good a coolant) and have
a small tank for hydrogen just for fuel.  It is also
reasonable that to get throughput orders of magnitude
higher than a normal reaction (and still be small enough
to fit on a ship) your efficiency will drop.

Well, I would be curious to see how this works up for jump -6
(ie is a jump 6 ship making one jump cheaper than a jump -3
making 2?).  However, in any case, their will be long
distance trade (the background if full of thing being
shipped from the Capital and the Extents to the Marches)
and there will cargos going longer than jump-6.  There
will also be jump-1 ships taking jump 2 cargos because
their don\'t happen to be any jump 2 ships around.

However, there is problem here, IMO, and that is with
the flat cost of cargo being based on numbers of jumps
(regardless of length).  Even if we buy the explination
that the Imperium fixed rates (and it is not clear why
they should do it such a pointless way), then the
background doesn\'t make sense.  The most profitable routes
will be with jump 1 ships and it is these routes that
the megacorps will move into first.  The background
describes the tramp steamers as jump 1 ships eaking out
a living, yet these will be the most profitable.

Weapons require lots of power, but not all the time. A substantial fraction of
the mass and price of a warship is power plant to support the weapons. 
There has to be *some* niche in which a low-efficiency high-peak-power 
plant is cost-effective for powering weapons. 

I invite all the people who support the jump-drive-includes-high-peak-power-
power-plant theory to suggest numbers for it - what fraction of the jump
drive is Miracle Power Plant, how much power it generates, how long it runs 
for, etc. It\'s very hard to come up with a version that is both simultaneously
(a) so much better at peak power that it is never better to substitute a 
conventional power plant
(b) so inefficient that it\'s never better to use the Miraclo plant to 
power weapons.

A friend of mine makes reproduction obsidian arrow points, and says the
reason they penetrated the conquistadors mail was because they shattered and
drove small, very sharp pieces of glass through the rings. Evidently the
wounds tended to fester more readily than ordinarily.

Also, knapping obsidian requires great care, because the little shards of
glass get _everywhere_ and are tough to clean up.

I have to agree with Mike. I always pictured Traveller while reading any of
the Solar Queen books. I can actually picture most spacemen learning 
their trade this way. 
   BTW, have any of you seen the movie based on her book Starship
Troopers? Previews don\'t exactly look like I remember the book.

Make that *naval* spending. All navies will be involved in anti-piracy work.
Arguably planetary and subsector navies will be more involved, because it\'s
their economies the pirates are affecting.

As much as the Army and Marines may disagree, the Navy is the main arm of
the military in the Trav universe.

Yes. All that stuff is covered in the 30% cost per annum for maintainence.
Assuming a fleet of 70 Kinuirs, we are spending the equivalent of building
18 Kinuirs a year in recurrent naval spending. That pays for a *lot* of
navy bureaucrats, admirals piloting a desk, maintainence depot workers,
spare parts subcontractors and so on.

This is getting into the whole "Are fighters viable under Trav rules" debate.
Me, I say anything without a gigawatt main weapon capable of combat out to 
one light-second should not stand in line of battle, but may be suitable
for auxilary duty (eg patrol, escort and anti-pirate work).

Yup. In my example, about 18 new Kinuirs a year worth, for a 70 Kinuir fleet.

Once again, all the Navy\'s "tail" is what explains the mammoth 30% of ship
value per year maintainence cost.

And yes, large worlds will protect worlds they find important. The Imperium
will protect what it considers important - the space between the worlds.

Merchants will also adopt the millenia old protection of the weak against
the strong-
convoy. Five Free Traders, each with one missile rack with conventional
missiles, a sandcaster and a laser turret will easily cause unacceptable
damage to a 400 t pirate ship and thus force the pirates to adopt
concentration against concentration, with all the problems that implies.

Of course, convoy will affect how many jumps you can make per year
(down-time waiting
for enough ships to be secure), but if the customers want the cargo to get
through,
then they can pay for freight at War rates.

Finally, didnt the Vilani use massive convoys during the Ziru Siirka ?

Let be the first to say Huh?

Starship Troopers was written by the Grand Master Robert Heinlein

The movie hasn\'t been released yet, but even the director admits they took
out all the discussion, the powered armor, and made the MI *draftees*, and
reshot Aliens.

Skip this one out of respect for Virginia.

 Ms. Norton didn\'t write "Starship Troopers", Robert A. Heinlien did.  And
so far, the previews seem to be following the book and the Avalon Hill game
pretty closely.  We\'ll see whether or not they kept the other aliens in it,
the human-like "skinnies".

Even the *worst* of Norton\'s SF is still full of little details and

Well, you have to remember that this isn\'t something you "aim". It\'s
something you "set off".

One of the more interesting things about a universal phase transition
is that it would propogate at light speed. So you *could* outrun it.

First thing is that you need a powerplant capable of converting all
that hydrogen to energy *quickly*. Then you need hompolar generators or
the equivalent to store the energy for that one massive burst. Finally,
you need a meson gun designed to *handle* that big a burst of energy.

I rather suspect that the end result would be that you can\'t fit the
gun, power plant or homopolar generators (accumulators) into the ship.

To put it another way, what you are doing is equivalent to asking "Gee,
what if we equipped a battleship with a gun that could use *all* the
powder and shells in the magazine in one shot?" If you look at it that
way, you realize *why* it doesn\'t work.

The percent of the GNP expended on the military averages 3%.  This can rise
as high as 15% on worlds with high international tensions.  The military

Member worlds of interstellar states generally transfer 30% of their
military budgets to maintain interstellar military.  Independent worlds may
expend their entire budget for local defense.

Jump drives do improve in fuel efficency (in MT) but not until TL 17. 
This implies three things to me:

1) Improveing the fuel efficency of a jump drive is hard work.
2) At less than TL 17 the theoretical understanding of jump drive is
still somewhat questionable.
3) At TL\'s 9 through 15 most of the theoretical efforts being done on
jump drives is all trying for higher jump numbers.  THis effort works
for quite a while gaining jump 1 at TL 9, Jump 2 at TL 11 (finding the
2nd level of jump space must be theoretically difficult, jump 3 at TL
12, jump 4 at TL 13, jump 5 at TL 14, and jump 6 at TL 15.  At TL 16
they try for jump 7 (not knowing it is imposiible).  When they fail they
start looking harder at other aspects of jump.  At TL 17 they sucseed in
needing less fuel for jump.  As TL\'s increase further the fuel needed
for jump steadily decreases.

Have you done an economic analysis of the validity of gas giant
refueling if the mainworld is a gas giant satellite ?  If you did not
have to travel as far to get to the gas giant you would not loose as
much time.  It might well still be more profitable to avoid gas giant
refueling but it would be a lot closer thing.

I also thing that it may be an error to look at the per anum profits. 
What about the case of a merchant ship that is just getting by and flat
out _does_not_have_ the money needed for regular refueling ?  Sure they
would make more per year if they refuled at the starport but they can
not afford to do so.  It is the old problem of having to have money
before you can make money.  Similarly they would make more if they
engaged in speculative trade rather than hauling cargo but again they
may not be able to afford to buy trade goods in the first place.

A friend of mine used to make such things (he was studying antro and
archeology). He said that the preferred practice material for small
things like arrowheads was pieces of broken pop bottle. He said he made
some *lovely* arrowheads from the bottoms of the old green coke

Ok, it\'s like this...

Back when the universe was formed in the big bang, all four forces
(strong force, weak force, gravity, and electromagnetism) were all the
same. As the energy dropped, the rules changed a bit, and the forces
seperated. Not all at once either. I think it was strong force, weal
force, electromagnetism, gravity. 

We\'ve managed to achieve energy densities where the weak and
electromagnetic forces merge.

Anyway, the idea of phase transitions is that there may be lower energy
states for the universe than the one it\'s currently in. It doesn\'t drop
to them because there\'s an energy "hump" that space time has to be
boosted over. We happened to slip past the hump as the universe cooled.
But the wrong sort of application of *lots of energy might drag part of
the universe above the hump and then let it slide down the other side.
And it\'d likely drag the rest of the universe with it.

As an analogy, consider a container of super-cooled water. This is
liquid water that has been carefully cooled below freezing. It\'ll stay
liquid as long as you don\'t introduce a seed crystal of ice, or agitate
it (supply enough energy to bump it over the hump). Supply either, and
the entire contents of the container freez as fast as the "wave of
crystalization" can travel across it.

So basicly, if the universe *does* have a lower energy state, "kicking"
it the wrong way would result in it transitioning to the lower energy
state, which will have noticeably different properties.

Not necessarily. It *could* be using the energy at a more fundamental
level. Just what *are* the details of a fusion reaction at the quark
level, anyway?

Perhaps it\'s doing something utilizing the quark-quark reactions, and
you wind up with "fusion" as a side effect. Unfortunately, the reaction
uses the energy thus produced. So it\'s a great way to convert hydrogen
to helium, but the energy output is ridiculously low. 

This actually has possibilities. For the folks that reverse engineered
a jump drive, what they may have *thought* they had was a *high* power
fusion reactor (after all, it is *obviously* designed to handle
*massive* flows of hydrogen, and looks like it should be fusing it).

For the folks who invented it on their own, they may have started out
with a design for a new type of fusion reactor.

In either case, after some accidents at "low" power show that it
doesn\'t like grav fields much, the try it far enough out in space and
get rather surprised when the reactor jumps. 

Given the previous accidents, it\'d probably be being run by remote
control and sending lots of telemetry. So it disappears in a flash, and
then a week later while they are still trying to figure out what
happened this time, they get a weak signal on the telemetry band....

This could also explain why they are a bit vague on how jump drives
work. They don\'t really *know* why. But they have determined
empirically how the drives behave.

Some on TML have argued that "fuel" for jump is actually some kind of
displacement mass handwaved so that it has to be pure hydrogen. The reason
we do not improve J-drives until TL-17 is that no so called major race
really understand jumpdrives and jumpspace (they all got their copies from
Yaskoydroy according to a very interesting conspiracy theory here on TML) -
my addittion to this is arguing that Yaskoydroy gave all major races their
j-drives so that they\'ll get the blame when baddies from the core arrive
and wondering whye the hell someone is misusing their galactic powersystem
(jumpspace is simply a sideeffect of their huge superscience powersystem).

	Just had that kind of experience this week.  At the firm I work
for, I was told that all the computers are on W95... which, albeit being a
few TLs behind the MacOS that I\'m used to, is something that I can still
work with.  However, then, in the student room, I discovered to my horror
that the students\' computers are still running DOS and WP5.1.

	I still haven\'t figured out where to start shovelling the coal in ;).

Just received my copy. AFAIAC, the lack of TLs makes the whole thing almost 
worthless - any other data is irrelevant if you\'ve no way of telling 
whether or not they\'re available on the planet you\'re on.

Other problems (these are just the ones I spotted after a couple of short 
skims through the book):

- - Often, the introductory text for each section has no connection at all to 
(and sometimes contradicts) the actual vehicles listed.

- - While engine type and endurance are listed, fuel capacity is not, so you 
don\'t know what it costs to refuel when you run out.

- - Weapon descriptions are too vague. What\'s the damage of a \'plasma 
cannon\'? What\'s the range of a \'laser turret\'? If we new the TL, we could 
make a guess, but we don\'t.

- - Some vehicle data are listed as \'?\' or \'classified\'. For a couple of 
vehicles, almost everything except the name is unknown. What the f*ck is 
the point?

- - The tables explaining what the data mean are at the back. They should be 
at the front. IMHO.

This really makes me angry. A potentially very useful book ruined for no 
reason. Unless somebody (preferably the author, since he\'s the only person 
who knows) produces a list of TLs and weapon stats for these vehicles, I\'m 
*very* tempted to send this book back to IG with detailed instructions 
about where to shove it.

Starlane Drive Manufacturers has announced a diversification programme that

has been combined with a local Diasporan design house, Lavondyss

The arrangement will combine the best of military drive technologies to the
naval architectural requirements of the commercial sector. A spokesman for
the company stated that "Although this merger moves Starlane into the
commercial sector away from a dependency on military contracts, the company
does not rule out bidding for Naval contracts."

The company has denied any intentions to join the Imperial Ship Builders
Association (ISBA). A speaker for the company stated that "the ISBA is an
incestuous relationship between the manufacturers of the new Imperium and
the Throne. It is part of the ongoing attempts of the Imperium to
economically support its expansionist policies. The relevance of the ISBA
to this region is negligible - links with the Old Earth Union are much more
important."

with pirates (okay I know the current thread shoots this down but they\'re
funded by the Zho\'s in my world, preFFW) and general missing all the clues
that come their way about Twilight\'s Peak.

To date, the most dangerous encounter has been getting past the Maitre D at
the restaurant: they\'ve been non-violent and the last four sessions have
involved 1 sacking, 2 visits to restaurants, two interviews and a
disciplinary hearing. Needless to say, the referee was getting a tad
bored...

Anyway, they arrived at the scout base at Dinomn, and were asked to carry a
covert team back to Dinom to retrieve some Zuchai crystals. Knowing that
there was a limited Imperial warrant available to the person asking them (a
character from 101 Travellers p57 Cimaya Emell) they agreed to do the job.
The scenario was loosely based on Marc\'s \'Crystals on Dinom\' from BJTAS2.

They arrived at Medianne, location of the HQ of the company who owned the
info and decided to raid the offices to covertly find the information. This
went well (they used a commercial emergenyc breaching charge to blow the
front door, and went in the back. Most of the group were armed with TL11
Snub Pistols, though the Aslan Engineer had a TL13 Heavy Snub (basically
the 30mm SMG from EA). Now, they were being discrete until our \'youth\'
(real age 17, going on 12) encountered one of the revolutionaries who had
occupied the building carrying a bucket of water to throw at the fire.

He achieved surprise and drilled the guy with a \'burst fire\' attack. This
resulted in a large messy fatality, after which the subtle approach went
out the window. The aslan destroyed the base of a stairwell and the three
NMEs hiding there with a burst fire attack, and the players kept on winning
initiative. End result? 9 NMEs dead, 1 player almost unconscious from a
shotgun hit (the vac suit and cover saved her), another two with light
damage from snub pistol explosive back blasts.

Conclusion -
	1) Snub Pistols are more dangerous in T4 than they were in MT.
	2) Burst fire is very nasty (possibly 10D damage with a snub!)
	3) Initiative is critical in T4
	4) I like the combat system - it is fast and potentially very lethal.
	5) Once you get into burst fire and 5D base damage, called shots
aren\'t that necessary!

Any thoughts?

Those computations would have been wrong. A medium sized world (500 million
inhabitants) would have a TCS naval budget of MCr250,000 which would allow
them a fleet worth MCr2,500,000 or 6.9 Tigresses. It\'s the high-population
worlds that really up number of naval vessels around.

So whatever book you\'re talking about has been published and it\'s too late

I recognize these figures. They\'re from _Striker_. And they have a bigger
spread than TCS, but about the same average. They are not going to reduce
your fleet size significantly from TCS. They may even increase them.

Too bad. I had hoped that after PE you would have gone with the average
income of 10,000, with the difference in actual buying value put on the
exchange rates.

The problem here is that the average TL of the Imperium is not 9, it it 12.
3% of 16,000 is 480, so on the average you\'re not very far from the Cr500
in TCS. And you now have the option of increasing that by a factor 5 in
times of crisis where TCS only allowed an increase of about 1.5. Worse,
there is a build-in bias in the world generation rules that gives high-
population worlds a higher average TL than the rest. Furthermore high-
population worlds have a good chance of being industrial too, which ups
their income by anouther 1.4. A world like Vincennes (Deneb 1122) would
have an average income of Cr33,600 which, with a tax of 3%, would give
Cr1,008.

This does help quite a bit. But have you calculated the size of the army
you\'ll get with that kind of a budget? Mora, for example, will have an
army budget of Cr370 per citizen, or MCr3,700,000. You can keep quite a
lot of people in uniform with 3,7 trillion credits, even if you have to
equip them too.

Which means that if a TL 15 world want to invest in some patrol ships they
can buy the drives from a TL 12 world and get them 15% cheaper...

Splendid. That limits the number of big ships you can build and force you
to use that much more on small ships. So instead of having perhaps 1% of
your fleet consisting of ships suitable for pirate suppression, you will
have 90% or more consisting of <5,000 T ships. Not a big help for the 
survival-minded pirate...
 
>I hope this is of some use.

Yes indeed, thank you very much. I\'m just sorry to learn that you haven\'t
followed up on what PE began and worked out a consistent economic system.

Only if there is no port; refuelling at a Gas Giant still takes more time
than it takes to refuel at a port. Of course, there are systems that don\'t
have a real port. In such systems, and only in such systems, will you see
Gas Giant refuelling.

Only if the planet don\'t have water. It will be far easier, and thus 
cheaper, to get your fuel from the planet than from a Gas Giant.

If a trader loses several days each jump by refuelling at Gas Giants, he
won\'t be able to survive on what he can earn at standard freight rates
in the rest of the time.

OK. I only had figures worked out for passenger liners up to jump 3, so I
worked out the cost of a mid passage with a jump 6 liner; the freight
business will have comparable figures.

As it turns out (unless I\'ve made a mistake, which is quite possible as I
did the calculations on the fly), a 600 T jump-3 liner should be able to
sell tickets at Cr9,000 per jump, or Cr18,000 for a six-parsec trip. But
a 600 T jump-6 liner has to charge Cr33,000 for a jump, which is quite a
bit more expensive. Interesting... I\'ll have to do the figures for jump-4
and jump-5 soon, but I haven\'t the time just now. 

>However, in any case, their will be long distance trade (the background

Definitely. And if I didn\'t make any mistakes, the traffic will be jump-3
or possibly jump-4 instead of jump-6 (unless time is a factor, which it
will be sometimes).

>There will also be jump-1 ships taking jump 2 cargos because there don\'t

But not too often, because a jump-1 ship can\'t survive on the rates that
a jump-2 ship can offer.

Especially since jump-3 ships can\'t survive on the rates as they are fixed.
(You know, I\'m almost sure that the Cr9,000 figure I gave above is wrong.
I seem to recall that it was Cr11,500. I\'ll have to check when I come home
tonight).

I agree with you 100%. That\'s why I\'ve been trying to work out the true
rates based on the true expenses. Unfortunately I\'m not in agreement with
some of the expenses either (The life support costs are way too high, IMO,
and the fuel costs are wrong too). Perhaps the Cr11,500 I remember was
when I did use the official expenses...

Yeah but is power really the main limiting factor?  Regular power
supplies aren\'t so big or expensive that you can\'t put in a bigger
one if you want more effective use of weapons.  If jump drive power
supplies are like a ram jet, either they run at full tilt, or
near full tilt, or they don\'t run at all (actually I don\'t know
if ram jets have to run at full tilt, but you get the idea) then
if you consider the limited use in loosing all, or big portion,
of your jump fuel for one round of increased fire power battle
(while  simultaneously dumping enough extra energy to be seen
through out the system) and having to carry the expense and wasted space
on all those extra power leads and equipment to dump the excess
energy, then it is quite reasonable, IMO, that jump drives would
not be used for "normal" power.

J-man is correct RAH wrote Starship Troopers, But after that I disagree. From
what I\'ve seen on their web site and the previews the movie has little in
common with the book bu the basic plot of humans against aliens. Why, they even
left out the Mobile Infantry power armor, which, when the book was written, was
totally new and original. I\'ll probably go see it when it comes out, but I\'m
afraid I\'ll be disappointed! I cut my sci-fi teeth on the "Grand Master\'s"
work, and I\'m afraid this will be another "Puppetmasters",  a decent sf movie
but NOT what Heinlien wrote.

5% of someone\'s yearly income going to _only_ the navies?  I reiterate what I
said at the beginning of this debate:  this could really be considered Boston
Tea Party levels of taxation.  In my humble opinion, I think that people
wouldn\'t stand for this.  I think naval taxes would be among the lowest taxes
to avoid revolt and dissent.  The vast majority of people in Traveller are
_not_ starfarers.  In fact, there\'s a good chance that most people will not
ever even see a spaceship close up, let alone a starship.

So, where am I going with this?  The further removed people are from
something, the less they will like paying _high_ taxes for it.  Sure, every
enlightened person "knows" that the navy keeps the pirates, the Zhos,
theVargr and the Aslan out of our system.  It doesn\'t mean they have to like
paying for it.

Make 5% _total_ military and imperial spending (including local army, wet
navy, aerospace force, space force, Imperial Scouts, etc.) and I\'ll accept
this.

>As much as the Army and Marines may disagree, the Navy is the main arm of
>the military in the Trav universe.

No disagreement here if you mean IMPERIAL military.  Planetary citizens are
going to get very itchy if they have no standing army.  The Imperial military
is mainly the navy, as far as I can gather from all canon sources.  The
marines serve as ship\'s troops and jump troops.  The Imperium has a small
army, but relies mostly on local worlds and mercenaries to keep the peace.
 Imperial army spending will be low, but individual world spending would be
considerably higher.

Where are you pulling this 30% number out from?

Fighters are canon, and have been since the early days of Traveller.  Since
we\'re mainly dealing with canon here, we should keep them regardless of the
"are fighters viable under trave rules" debate.

This really disappoints me.  After the great supplement, EA, I was

How can they skip the TL\'s?

The EA, which I was assuming the EV would be modled after (and was

Actualy, rolled-cotton armor with a leather skin was the standard among
Aztec warriors precisely because it offered the best protection against
obsidian darts and arrows.

Which cloth armor won\'t do, hence its superiority.  Many Spaniards adopted
variants of Aztec rolled-cotton armor because it was lighter, more
comfortable, and more effective against Aztec weaponry than chain.

Tell me about it!  My wife knapped about a quarter kg of obsidian to
produce small flakes for an art project, using our fireplace hearth as a
work surface, and (in theory) the fireplace itself to catch the debris.
No such luck...teeny shards of obsidian got all over our living room,
invisible in the carpet, and destroyed our vaccuum cleaner before *most*
of them were cleaned up.

Powered armor doesn\'t make the book...it is a weird choice, though.  The
political and philosophical discussion (and illustrations) *do* make the
book, and it ain\'t ST without them.  On the draft issue, though...

This has always been one of the subtler points of the book to me.  Yes,
you\'re free not to \'volunteer\' for service (military or Peace Corps-ish)
according to the surface message of the book, with the only cost being
that you forfeit your right to vote.  However, in my view, the book
contains numerous hints that other informal sanctions apply -- you\'ll
never get a good job, good housing, whatever unless you\'ve served.  It\'s
also clear that at a social level everyone without exception is *expected*
to \'volunteer\', and those who do not do so become outcasts from their
peers.

So, in short, saying that the MI were \'drafted\' isn\'t technically
accurate, but may be closer to the truth than you imply.

> Skip this one out of respect for Virginia.

With *this* point I\'m in utter agreement!

agreed.

How are you figuring that?  Burst fire damage is like autofire
damage--you double the dice.

So a snub does 5D?  Then, you doulbe these results.  Ex:  you roll 5D,
and the results are 1,3,5,6,2.

This translates to damage of 2,6,10,12,4.

Doubling dice is just slightly different than rolling 10D.  For
instance, 1\'s aren\'t possible when you double dice, but are possible
when you roll 10D.

>         3) Initiative is critical in T4

Oh yea Baby!  We\'ve learned that the hard way.

The other night, I let one of my players run an NPC policeman (his
character wasn\'t involved, and I was keeping him involved in the
game--besides that\'s one less thing I have to worry about as a GM).

I had two guys coming in, both with gauss pistols set on full
automatic.  He had an auto shotgun, set on full auto.

We went into initiative, he won, and BAM!  Both of my bad guys were
incapacitated, one dead and one unconscious (group hit rule).

Deadly,deadly stuff.

Also, we\'ve spiffed up our game by going tactical.  We\'re using Snapshot
tactical movement rules from CT.  I\'ve done a few Ken\'s Tweaks to them
to make them completely compatible with T4.

In this system, every action a PC takes costs points (action points). 
If he moves a square (1.5 meters), for instance, it costs him one
point.  If he fires his weapon on full auto, it costs him 6 points, and
so on.

Well, this has been a real neat improvement in my game because my
players can influence when they go in the round (initiative).  If you
want to do a lot in the round (like move a good distance and fire you
gun), you\'re going to go later.

Why?

I follow standard T4 initiative rules, except I add the amount of
movement points bid.

Our initiative goes like this:

First, everybody bids on how many points they are going to use in the
round.

Second, we roll initiative normally, except the action point bid is
added to the normal inititive throw.  Lowest goes first.

As a player, you have to decide.  Do you want to do a lot in the round,
with the big chance that you\'re going last, or do you want to keep you
actions to a minimum, thereby helping you to go earlier in the round.

You might want to try this.  It adds a whole new dimension to the game.

Kenneth.

	there is a well known maximum : one third of the jump drive
	are HPG banks.

	Lets say its a Tl9/100dt Scout

		Tl9-J1 ~ 5dt jump drive ~ 23qm HPG ~ 230Mj HPG capacity

	asumining a maximum ROF of Tl*25 ( or I\'ll pack all lasers on
	a single HPG round robin ;-)

		230Mj * 225 ~ 29 MW

	now lets look how to procude 30 MW, asuming TNE base limits
	these 30MW wont come from a 100qm/200MW PP, or in T4 from a
	even larger plant. These 30MW come from your standart PP,
	running all the time. What happen with those 30MW, they are
	pulsing graph wells like in a graph focused laser, together
	with these graph wells the LHy is relased to build a steady
	jump bluble, to avoid collapse to a point zero, as the ship
	is now point zero behind a event horizon, tunneling thru
	the so called jump space. Its not the most nervous time
	of the chief, allways looking at the HPGs, the plant, the
	disposern and pulsern. Anything failing now, will at best
	cause a missjump if detected, but could case that the ship
	is realy becoming the imaginative point, the mirco hole.

	Next question :

	Why is a military TL12 J1 drive for a 100dt ship still,
	5dt and not 4.1dt ?

	The HPG is smaller, but its allways better to have more
	HPG then needed, even the Tl9-J1 had backup HPG.

	To cite FFS " capacitators store electricity directly as

	To be mechanicaly devices is ok for laser HPGs, you use

	for a week, will certainly increase wearvalue if the chief

	And last question :

	Why is the JDs HPG not used for lasers ?

	Overcharging HPGs will cause 2d20 major hits in power
	plant and jump drive. As its usual to discharge laser
	HPGs infrequently, they are a bit differnt. Heavy weapons
	on tl15+ warships are often connected in a PP,JD/HPG,

Maybe at the beginning, but when it became clear that the director hadn\'t
bothered to read the book, and was only interested in producing yet another
blood splattered shoot-em-up, she removed herself from the film and started
campaigning to have Heinlein\'s name taken of the title.

At this year\'s WorldCon in San Antonio, the trailer was greeted with
deafing chourses of boos and catcalls..

I\'d argue this point...  The whole point of the MI was that they could be
effective in small groups due to the armor.  MI used grenade launchers,
smart missiles, and small plasma weapons to maximum effect.

I remember rereading the book at the National Training Center at Ft. Irwin.
 After reading the final combat sequence, I pulled out a map and did some
figuring.  ONE platoon of MI had held an area that an entire US Army
Brigade could barely defend.

Except that the Rico family is rich, lives well, and Juan was going to
recieve a vacation to Mars as a graduation gift (the equivilant of touring
Europe?).  The impression I got was that while certain government jobs were
restricted to veterans, the primary difference between Citizen and Taxpayer
was the ability to vote.

Except draftees can\'t quit.  The service gives you every chance to back out
before your graduation.  Also, anybody over eighteen can join, even Juan\'s
father who must have been in his late forties by the middle of the book.
If you decide at 90 that you have to be a Citizen, they will find you an
appropriate job.

Without getting into a totally off subject discussion of RAH\'s philosophy (oft
times called "facists"), I have to disagree with you on this point. While he did
imply that CIVIL SERVICE jobs were restricted to veterans, he made it clear IMHO
that none vets could do well for them selves. Juan\'s on father was not a vet
during the majority of the book, yet it was made clear that his familly was
well-to-do with his father owning his own business.

I believe that his whole point was to point out that authority without the
responsibility, as he saw in our society, could only lead to decline. I\'m not
sure I agree that the society he envisioned would work, military duty doesn\'t
confer any more intelligence or reasoning power, but I also don\'t agree that a
lw degree does either, (as seems to be the trend in the U.S., today.)

Any way sorry for the off subject post.

Oh, I didn\'t quite see it that way.  Sure those that *did* volunteer
probably thought less of those that didn\'t, but they wouldn\'t have
discriminated against the non-volunteers in *that* society.

To me, what Heinlein was exploring was the role of responsibility that an
individual owes to society and the responsibilities that society owes to
the individual.  The individuals that *chose* to serve are taking on the
responsibility for organizing, governing (that\'s the franchise), and
protecting their society.  Part of the social contract was that the
"volunteers" assumed the responsibility for protecting the rights, lives
and fortunes of the "non-volunteers" what they got in return (besides the
franchise) was the knowledge that they were the protectors of society.  ;->

I, personally, don\'t think a human society could *maintain* that nobel
attitude.  I\'m afraid it would evolve into precisely what you describe, and
based on RAH\'s other writings I suspect he would agree. But he was
presenting a series of social lessons in ST, more than trying to describe
how a *real* society would organize itself, so he had to maintain an
unrealistic level of idealism in the book.

One point that a lot of people miss when discussing RAH\'s work is that most
of it was written for the "juvenile" market.  Some of his short fiction and
all his novels from _Stranger In A Strange Land_  on were written for
adults, but most of his work in the 40\'s and 50\'s was aimed *specifically*
at boys and girls in the 8 to 16 age range.  This colored his writing, what
subjects he covered, how he covered them, how his characters acted and
reacted, etc. 

>> Skip this one out of respect for Virginia.

>With *this* point I\'m in utter agreement!

Yeah, I am too.  And the fact that this movie is likely to be a stinker
doesn\'t hurt either. ;->

It is my understanding, too, that the Aztec\'s used a quilted leather armor
with cotton filling and a linen backing.  The quilting material\'s tangled
fibers worked well against the slashing obsidian studded swords and the
linen backing made it easier to extract darts and arrow points that had
used up most of their energy punching through the leather and cotton
quilting.

What the quilted armor *didn\'t* do well was resist thrusts from steel
swords or lead bullets.

I don\'t have much to say that brings this back to Traveller...;->

Eh? You consider those poor slugs in the fancy flak jackets to be close to
Heinlien\'s MI? Three choices:

1) You don\'t remember the book or the Avalon Hill game very well.
2) You are seeing a different set of previews than what I have seen.
3) Your eyesight is worse than mine. 

Sorry, but Hollywood has once more taken great science fiction and produced
big budget SCI-FI, as Harlan Ellison has pointed out many times in the
recent past.

I may not find Harlan someone I agree with often, but on the subject of
Science Fiction vs SCI-FI, I do agree. That is the key to Traveller and to
great authors, like Heinlien, Clark & Asimov. Speculative Science in a
Fictional setting to explore human interactions & reactions. Not big bangs,
bright lights and gee whiz special effects for cardboard sterotypes re play
classic westerns against.

In the beginning they were going to do the MI suits, but they were too bulky
with the cooling gear, and too brutally hot with the cooling gear removed.
In addition, IIRC, they couldn\'t get the suits to "move" right, and they
needed far too many suits with all the extras involved.

From a logistics point of view, I also think it would be difficult for
someone watching the movie to tell the main character\'s suit from anyone
else\'s (this wasn\'t a reason I heard, this is just my own observation).

Sorry to continue an off topic discussion here, but its one of those things
that gets under my nails.  Every time a new SCI-FI movie comes out,
science-fiction readers the world around get all up in arms.

Films are a dynamic, visual medium.  People tend to have short attention
spans, and not everybody wants to go to a heavy, deep cerebral movie.
 Usually I don\'t like deep, cerebral movies.  There are a few exceptions, but
none are even remotely on topic here.  As a result, movies have to be dynamic
and visual, read bright lights, gee whiz and classic westerns.

I didn\'t like Aliens for the deep philosophical underpinnings.  I liked it
\'cause space marines blowed stuff up.  I didn\'t like Alien for its heavy,
cerebral dialog (there was none, was there?), I liked Alien because it was a
1950s man in a rubber suit movie updated to a more modern look and feel.  I
liked it because the Alien looked cool.  Same thing with the Star Wars
series, and the Star Trek series (with the exception of Star Trek: The
Motionless Picture).  Terminator was one of the best sci-fi films of all
time.  Why was it cool?  Arnold with an UZI killing cops, Arnold having his
skin torn off, Arnold\'s endo-skeleton battering down doors as a cool 80s
synth soundtrack plays in the background.  And then there\'s Escape from New
York, my favorite sci-fi film of all time.  Why was it cool?  Kurt Russell
shooting his SMG, Isaac Hayes as the Duke with his cool ass car,
stormtrooper-esque cops...

As I said, there are exceptions.  2001, 2010, Contact, and Starman all leap
to mind, and all of these were good, and Starman had very few special effects
at all...

My point is, if I want speculative science in a fictional setting, I\'ll open
up a book and read.  And I\'ll pick my book well too, because the vast
majority of modern science fiction books are licensed franchises that hold
about as much interest with me as your average commercial.  If I want big
explosions, automatic weapons fire, cardboard cut-outs doing the good vs.
evil thing, and pointy headed monsters slavering and chomping away I\'ll go
see a movie.

That, and I really like Sno-Caps and Cherry Coke, and they ONLY taste good at
the movie theater.

Well, of course the larger systems will also have interplanetary
traffic at the gas giant using it for fuel, plus you will have
traffic in an out getting fuel to sell at port.  Nor
do I agree that skipping port would be only when unavoidable.
The travel times to jump at a gas giant are only a few hours
more (which can easily be lost in waiting for traffic or
ones turn to refuel at port).  Add the free cost and I see
it as immentently viable.

(Here I almost forgot we had moved on the a new thread and
put in something about piracy :-)  Amazing how one can get
into a rut.

Not necessarily.  What does it cost to split the water?  How
does this compare to shipping (mining a gas giant would
just require throwing containers into a trajectory that
reaches the main planet eventually (like we currently do
by sticking punny little chemical thrusters on our probes).
Then it coasts for free (no fuel, no salaries, no nothing)
and is picked up at the main planet.

A slow ship looses, at most, looses just under a day (compared to an

Yeah, but they survive on Jump-1 cargos and just take jump-2 cargos
as an exception (I\'m not advocating that all, or even most, traffic
would go through gas giants, in fact I I wouldn\'t quibble with any
number between 20% and 80%).

I wouldn\'t mind seeing some number for reasonable costs for cargo
based on jump distance based on the current costs.  I might not
be perfect, but it would fix something.  I once looked at figuring
it out, but decided it was more time invested than I had at the
moment.

My point is that any tech that makes small groups ultracapable is
sufficient to get an ST-like military feel.  Powered armor is probably the
simplest way to get that effect, of course.  I truly can\'t understand how
Hollywood could pass up being true to the book *and* having something so
kewl-techish to put on the screen.  Maybe being untrue to the book has
become an end in itself at this point. :)

I had the feeling that the distinction ran deeper, but I may be projecting

True enough, and that is a crucial distinction.  Peer pressure plus
differential treatment doesn\'t equal being forced to choose between a
lengthy prison term and being shot at.  I was just suggesting that it
wasn\'t quite as no-strings a choice as you\'d initially implied.

I don\'t think this is necessarily off-topic; ST has certainly colored my
approach to Trav Marines and special forces, and the political/social
background of the book makes an interesting study for anyone working out
what drives the 3I.

I *had* forgotten that Rico Sr. was a clearly wealthy and influential
non-vet...guess it\'s been what, 10 years since I last read it, so details
are slipping.  This does indeed damage my case, of course.

I think military duty (or \'duty\' of any kind) does confer more
self-discipline and a wider view of responsibility...and perhaps that\'s
enough to get the benefits RAH describes.

And one more response...

Yes, perhaps I\'ve become too cynical to see it that way, but you\'re right,
the book itself, stripped of my prejudices, probably supports this view.
Oh, dear, now I have an excuse to read it again...what a tragedy... :)

In some ways this reminds me of Niven and Pournelle\'s Second Empire, in
which the nobility is largely, ah, noble, commited to securing benefits
for society at large...though N&P have stated explicitly that there\'s no
reason to expect this to last very long, it *does* happen to societies
from time to time.

Back to Traveller:  At what point in 3I history did this situation occur,
if ever?  M:0 has the scheming Cleon maneuvering to grab and consolidate
his power base, driving off or killing rivals and operating with a firm
eye on the bottom line, so probably not then; the RSB implies that, at
least in retrospect, Spinward Marches nobility had a large fraction of
dissipated scheming parasites; so -- was there some Camelot period in
between when the nobility was largely dedicated to the common good?

Yes, and reading his \'juveniles\' today always makes me wonder if he was
aiming too high, or if kids in general were just far more socially
\'intelligent\' than their modern replacements (save my own brilliantly
Heinleinesque daughter, of course. :))

	we are still playing TNE, with very simplified personal
	combat rules. The simplification is easy :

	We have 3 kinds of hits :

	- minor hits made with a role of the right difficulty level
	- normal hits made with one level higher 
	- good hits made with two levels higher

	Good hits kill, while normal hits cripple, a test on constitution
	reduces kill to cripple and cripple to a small wound.

		average, when hit from a weapon, intendet to cripple humans.
			(eg. knives, small pistols)
		difficult, when hit from a weapon, intendet to kill humans.
			(eg. swords, large pistols, small handguns)
		formidable, .... destroy vehicles.
			(eg. SMGs, small energy weapons)
		imposible, .... destroy starships.
			(starship, or groundbased energy weapons)

	Cover and Armor will reduce difficulty one level of the survival
	role, while the posibility to move and versalite cover increases
	the difficulty to hit for the to hit role on referees discretion.

	This is easy and fast and avoid that players start fire exchange
	without prior rethinking of proper tactic.

	Most "street fights" are not so bloody because neither side
	places a hit even on short distance, but if somebody is gotcha
	by a letal weapon hes likely dead within minutes. If one or

	The FTN is canon my early FTN is a bit different, what do

> Summary:		Information/Marketing/Survey
> Product Line : 	FTN

	The Free Traders Network is a union of free traders, traders who
	own their starship founded at Kange about 100 years BI. Started
	with one mainframe and an office at Kange for storing marketing
	information and survey datafiles. Membership of FTN is for "free
	traders" only, where free trader is defined as a captain or
	representative from a ship owned by the crew or parts of the crew.

	This restriction barly helps to exclude big companies and
	governments, because anybody owning a Yacht can claim to be a
	free trader. So many CEOs are personal members of the FTN.

	At 14 Imperial FTN had 173 offices storing FTN information at
	138 differnt worlds. A free trader who wants to access FTN has
	to pay 100Cr at FTN office and to carry FTN floodfeed to his
	next systems. Storage of unencrypted mail is free, while using
	the FTN floodfeed for private encrypted mail costs additional
	100Cr per year of storage.  Most FTN offices on backwater
	starports are just a room with a mainframe.

	FTN is a comparingly cheap service only working because free
	traders can not live without. At Kange the tradional FTN office
	is still in the backroom of Kanges Starport Bar, so are the most.
	FTN representatives are not payed, and have to bring at least
	one state of the art mainframe into the FTN.  Becoming an FTN
	repesentative is a typical retirement for a active free traders.

	FTN information has a high value, the surveys are most times
	more acurate that the Scout-Service surveys, because they are
	based on traders first hand knowledge, and not limited by
	diplomatic ideotism (govlevel=lawlevel at example) On the other
	hand side, FTN is big, a Tl10 mainframe can barly store actual
	FTN data, while you need a Tl11 mainframe to make easy searches
	and a Tl12 mainframe to make expert system searches. Viewing
	FTN without expert software aid for valuable information is
	a imposible task of computer/edu, with a expert system this
	becomes formidable. Search for a private mail adressed to the
	own ship is routine using the FTN mainframe.

There\'s a passable new novel in the series called "Firehand". It\'s by
Norton and P.M. Griffin. It came out a couple years back. 

I note that the list of books in the front lists "Redline the Stars"
(again by Norton and Griffin) and I seem to vaguely recall that title
from an old article as being a Solar Queen story that never got
written. I may have to try ordeing it!

Another recent Norton release is "Brother to Shadows". It\'s only so-so,
but it would make a good "backstory" for an NPC Rogue. Human, raised by
alien martial artist/mystic types (yes, it *does* seem a bit like Kung
Fu). He has to leave gets involved with the Thieves guild, and gets
out of the mess. Typical Norton, if a bit less well developed than what
she used to do (hey, she\'s getting *old*!).

MacOS is ok. I find that I don\'t mind using it too much. Windoze is a
rather different matter. And I frankly consider MS-DOS to be overly
primitive. Unfortunately, MacOS has the same major shortcoming:
"Security? What\'s that?"

I\'d love to see what you\'d do confronted with some of my old 8-bit gear
(I eventually hope to have one of them running CP/M and WordStar :-)

BTW, silly Mac question... How the hell do you *compare* files? I had
two floppies both of which seemed to have the same program on them, but
I thought one copy might be damaged. Under MS-DOS, I\'d just run a
compare utility. But I can\'t find anything like that....

Which is weird, because you *have* to wear quilted padding that is
effectively the same as that "cloth armor" *under* your chainmail. 

You do this for two reasons. First, chainmail does *not* stop blows. It
just spreads the impact and (usually) prevents the cutting edge from
getting to you. 

Many an SCA fighter can tell you about the "waffle bruise" you get if
you have inadequate padding under chain. And both from tests on
inanimate objects "wearing" chain, and from old records it\'s quite
possible to wind up with the rings embedded in the wearer if the
padding is sufficiently inadequate.

Now you know *why* flint knappers either used a work area away from
everything else *or* spread out a hide to work on and bundled it up to
shake out outside. :-)

Better re-read the book. For example, it\'s strongly implied that Mr.
DuBois is one of the *few* teachers at the high school who is a veteran
(otherwise why make such a point of the fact that you have to be a
veteran to teach History & Moral Philosophy?).

For another, Juan\'s *father* is a business man. Quite well-to-do. And
he isn\'t shunned, and obviously got an ok job. And for that matter, all
thru the book, great pains are taken to *discourage* people from
joining the military. 

Oh yeah, don\'t forget that your "service" could quite easily be
*non*-Military. You could even request such. As Heinlein pointed in an
essay where he was commenting on the many strange ways critics seemed
to misinterpret the book, in that society "veteran" did *not* mean
"military veteran". Most folks wound up doing the equivalent of some
low-level *civil service* job.

Again, the MI were a *small* fraction of the people "serving their
term". And they went to great pains to keep things "volunteer".

I suspect that you are thinking of the implied "status" of someone who
refused to make a drop. That didn\'t sound like "shunning" to me. More
like pity.

Well, we also have the not so minor detail that with the exception of
retrieval and special situations like going into the tunnels, MI
operate *very* spread out. Remember, they do their "tight sweeps" with
men around 50 yards apart! On the attack on the skinny planet they were
more than a hundred yards apart (just barely in sight of each other, as
I recall).

That means that you *won\'t* have "crowds" of people in armor. But that
also means that most directors wouldn\'t have the vaguest idea how to
direct the scenes, and most of the audience wouldn\'t think it was much
of a battle. <sigh>

But given the helmet displays, and the way folks are spread out, I
suspect that a *small* company using state of the art computer graphics
(like Babylon 5 only better) I bet a decent job *could* be done.

One nice thing that helps if you want to do it right is that people are
*used* to false color graphics, and IR displays are so common (from
police and news coverage) that you could actually *show* the "IR"
images for the tunnel fights and the like. 20 or even 10 years ago,
people would have just been confused.

And remember, the only places we see the suits being *used* are at the
training center (which is pretty barren, and thus easy to model) and on
alien planets, where you can take a lot of liberties with things like
vegetation. 

I *really* think that you could handle most armor scenes with special
effects. And for the ones where you can\'t the objections the director
had are silly. Of *course* the suits are bulky. If he\'d read the book,
he\'d have noticed that a suited trooper was described as an *eight
foot* tall hydrocephalic gorilla. 

At eight feet tall, you can not only build in cooling, you can build
the damn thing around one of the *real* GE prototypes! I seriously
doubt that more than half a dozen of the suits would be needed for the
shots that have to be done "live".

	The trailers that I\'ve seen, with the troops marching around in
deserts, defending very primitive-looking forts, and so forth, makes me
think that ST the movie is gonna come out looking like Aliens meets The
Last Remake Of Beau Geste.

	Which in and of itself is not neccessarily a bad thing if you\'re
looking for mindless violent action flicks with big guns and alien ooze
flying everywhere, but calling it ST and linking it to Heinlein seems to be
misleading advertising.

	Back to the grind.

	Actually, from what I\'ve seen from the trailers ST looks more like
the classic French Foreign Legion movies.

	Betcha a share in FSY that the plotline at some point is going to
turn into landing on some desert planet, slogging through endless wastes
being followed by an enemy whose home turf it is, and then a long battle
scene as waves of expendable bad guy charge a small fort, ending in pyrrhic
victory for the good guys.  The crazed commander with waxed moustache,
monocle, and bad hollywood French accent may not make it in, but something
resembling him will be.

	Beau Geste, I tell you.  Think Beau Geste.

If by \'larger systems\' you mean systems with a lot of people, then that
isn\'t going to help the poor pirate at all, since such a system would have
the ability to patrol itself.

That\'s because you don\'t realize that for a freighter unrefined fuel at
Cr100/T represents roughly 3% of its expenses and entails the loss of 1.5%
of its cargo capacity in order to carry a fuel purifier plant. For a
passenger liner the fuel represent less than 2% (I\'m being a bit vague
here because I\'m using standard Traveller expenses rather than my own and
are doing the calculations on the fly). When you add the fact that
passengers might not enjoy diving into a Gas Giant (btw. in all your
arguments you are assuming that refuelling at a Gas Giant is just as
safe as refuelling at a starport (if it was more dangerous you\'d have
to add a risk factor to the expenses), which propably wouldn\'t be the
case even without pirates and certainly wouldn\'t be the case with pirates) 
and may care about hours such a trip adds to the journey, you\'ll see that 
passenger liners certainly won\'t use Gas Giant refuelling if an alternative 
exists. As for freighters, if the Gas Giant refuelling adds more than 7
hours to the trip then it is too expensive even if the refuelling itself
is as safe as can be. Even Free Traders will lose out if the trip adds more
than 10 hours (Free Traders makes one jump per 14 days or 336 hours; 3%
of 336 is 10.08).
 
>(Here I almost forgot we had moved on the a new thread and put in something

Sorry, I couldn\'t resist putting the pirates back in ;-) They are relevant
only if they constitute an added risk to Gas Giant refuelling.

About Cr5/T (That\'s what it costs to run a fuel purifier plant and a power
plant to supply the energy; that does assume that you can sell all the
fuel you refine). And that gives you refined fuel. The uncracked water
will give you unrefined fuel right away.

I don\'t know, but you have to figure in the cost of producing the
containers, the cost of sending them to the Gas Giant, the cost of
having a ship take them into the Gas Giant and send them back and the
cost of fetching the containers down to the planet. I doubt you can
do that as cheaply as running a hose into a nearby lake.

Far too much.

Very few merchants will have fast ships. It makes the ship more expensive
and cuts down on cargo space, making them less competitive (and making
their time more valuable, btw.).

Well, if you take the numbers I present below and add about 20% to the
ticket prices and subtract about 1/3 from the freight rates, you will
get something close to what you\'d get with the official expenses.

Note 1: The prices above was arrived at by designing a number of 600 T ships
each dedicated to one kind of passengers, ie. a ship with 1 T of cargo space
per passenger and 1 steward per 8 passengers for High Passengers, another
ship with negligible cargo space and 1 steward per 50 passengers for Mid
Passengers, a ship with small staterooms for Economy Passengers, a ship with
Low Berths and 1 medic per 20 berths for Low Passengers, and a ship with bunks
only for Steerage Passengers, plus a ship with cargo hold only for freight. 
In all cases, except the ships for Steerage passengers, the design included
emergency medical low berths enough to accomodate a full complement of crew
and passengers. The blank spots represent ships I haven\'t worked out yet.

Calculations available on request.

It appears that jump-3 ships are the most economic for long-distance haulage,
followed closely by jump-2 and jump-4 ships; at least when you don\'t factor
in gains and losses due to speedy vs slow delivery. In practice I\'d expect 
to see quite a few jump-4 ships on long-distance trips. There may even be a
niche for jump-6 ships, though I admit that a doubling in the cost is
pushing it. Still going between the Marches and Core you could save almost
a year, so...

And don\'t forget that Rico Sr. thought that it was a foolish idea to join
up. A lot of trouble for little gain. This _may_ have been sour grapes, 
but the impression I got was that joining up would _hurt_ Juan\'s future

From 200 to 400 when the enemies were mostly aliens AND outsiders (Vargr
and Aslans) perhaps? A related question: Is the Ileish Revolt a bunch of
selfish guys revolting against the noble nobles (and being heroically
outfought) or a bunch of noble guys revolting against the selfish nobles
(and being brutally crushed)? The whole tenor of Milieu 400 will depend
on that.

	Gee, I got _exactly_ the opposite impression--at Juan\'s family\'s social
level, it seemed quite gauche to go into Federal service. In fact, those
who _do_ volunteer tend to be looked down on. And his family certainly
seemed high up there:
	
	- "When my father bought me a Rolls copter for my fourteenth birthday..."
	- "You\'re going to study business at Harvard ... After that, you\'ll go to
the Sorbonne..."
	- For graduation, his father offers him a vacation trip to Mars.
	- There\'s an olympic length swimming pool in their house ...
	- "...if you reach Faraway, you really must look up my dear friends the
Regatos." This from Madame Ruitman, who isn\'t concerned in the least that
Faraway has been taken by the Bugs--...that\'s all right, they\'re civilians!"

	As for there being social pressure to join ... how about these quotes:

	- "So what is this so-called \'Federal Service\'? Parasitism, pure and simple."
	-"A decidedly expensive way for inferior people who otherwise would be
unemployed to live at public expense for a term of years, then give
themselves airs for the rest of their lives."
	- "It ought to be against the law to use the schools as undercover
recruiting stations."

	The feeling _I_ got out of the book was that, on Earth at least, and among
the higher strata of society, Federal Service was looked on pretty much the
way military and civil service is nowadays--something more for middle- and
lower-class types rather than the social elite. As for citizenship being
required for a "good job" or "good housing"--all that\'s ever mentioned is
that a _few_ jobs such as policemen and History & Moral Philosophy
instructor are required to be filled by veterans. Certainly no limitations
on good housing or business jobs. Again, look at Juan\'s father. And look at
the percentages given for citizenship--"...over eighty percent on Iskander
to less than three percent in some Terran nations..."

	And something most people seem to miss is that, although the book is about
the military branch of the Federal service, that\'s only a small fraction of
it. Most "veterans" have never been near a weapon... It\'s not the military
service or putting your life on the line that matters, it\'s the willingness
to subordinate yourself to the needs of society at large and accept direct
responsibility for making that society work, rather than simply going with
the flow (or against the flow) of society. You actually have to stand up
and say "I\'m going to do what\'s necessary to uphold and defend people\'s
rights, without any preconditions on how I do that." If you wind up as a
cook in the Navy, you accept it. If you wind up as a bureaucrat, you do
that. And if you wind up in the M.I., see, you get into that capsule, and
you go down, and you kill people and break their toys.

	Another point about the "social" pressure--*no* MI is ever forced into the
capsule. Every drop is completely voluntary. Yes, there\'s the consequences
of being discharged. But _everything_ in life has its consequences. There\'s
nobody pressuring you to "not be such a wussy" if you decide at the last
minute you\'re not getting in.

	Frankly, while powered armor and drop capsules are cool, and it\'s not
Starship Troopers without them, it\'s even MORE not ST without the
underlying philosophy.

Craig,

Re the first qoute: I tend to see the time period leading to the Emperors of the
Flag as possibly this type of Noble. Oddly enough I like to picture the in-fighting
of that period as being motivated by a sincere sence of social duty, that
eventually broke down into crass power grabbing. In other words the earliest (and I
don\'t have my books handy for names) Emperors of the Flag were attempting to
preform social reforms that they felt were needed, while later pretenders to the
throne were just power hungry. In My Personal Universe (tm) this period marks a
turning point among the Nobility. I haven\'t yet placed the beginning of this
"Camelot" (I like this term!) period, but the end falls into the EoF period.

Now to the second qoute: I grew up on the Heinlien juviniles and took much of it to
heart, (perhaps too much). When I had my own children I (not altogether on purpose)
appear to have instilled much of my perceptions of RAH\'s views on them. Today I
hear them repeat view points and statements that I made that could have come
directly from his books. With two sons currently active duty Marines and a daughter
in high school who speaks of joining the Navy on graduation, and all well rounded
in the arts, and grounded in the sciences, I like to think they are following The
Grand Master\'s mold, but then again that could just be my own pride coloring the
Real World (tm)  ;^>

It reminds me of one of the first Traveller tournaments I played in, back
when I didn\'t know the rules very well. Unfortunately, neither did the
referee. We got into a firefight with a crew of Aslans armed with Snub
Pistols and got wiped out. The whole fight took place at medium ranges
and it was only later that I realized that the referee had forgotten 
that Snub Pistols had a to hit DM of -8 at distances over 5 meters!

I don\'t remember how it is in MT, but in CT Snub Pistols _are_ lethal, but
only at close range. The trick is to make sure your opponent don\'t get to
close range.

 Leonard,
"Redline the Stars" is indeed a Solar Queen novel. Unfortunately I do not
rate it among the best but it is a passable read. I have also heard rumors
that it is the first in a new set of books in the series. If this is the
case than it\'s a good thing! I wouldn\'t buy the hard cover but a paperback
will be worth the price.

That\'s one of the arguments I use for reducing the average production of a
high-population world (something I\'d love to see canonized). In my Traveller
universe any world with a population of over 100,000,000 suffers a gradual
reduction in their average _surplus_ production (ie. what they have left
over for building ships when everybody is fed and bedded and all that). At
1 billion the naval taxes are 1/2 and at 10 billion it is 1/4. That still
makes high-population worlds powerful, just not as powerful as in the
official Traveller universe.

You must mean 15B not 15G, right?

My own theory about the Siru Zirka is that the Vilani deliberately kept the
populations of their worlds low and that most of their planets lay in the
pop 7-8 range. That would go a long way to explain how the Terrans managed
to defeat them (Well, perhaps not explain, but at least make it more
plausible).

As you know, I did just that. But last night it struck that it was
completely irrelevant, because the shipyard capacity you get in _TCS_
is the capacity that is available _after_ you take care of routine
work. If, for example, you are the ruler of a world with 100 million
citizens (which will give you a shipyard capacity of 100,000 T) and
decide that you want a new 100,000 dreadnaught, then (provided you have
the funds) you can start on it the next day, tying up all your shipyard
capacity for the next couple of years, and the rest of your fleet will
still get maintained and replaced. In other words, the 142 million T
capacity I calculated to account for maintenance and replacement are in
addition to the 158 million T (Btw. I just realized that the 142 million
T is wrong; annual maintenance takes two weeks, not one, as I\'ve assumed).

The Spanish quilted padding was optimized as padding, and hence lighter
and not as extensively crosswoven as the Aztec version.  The latter used
twisted \'strings\' of unspun cotton to create \'mats\' of obsidian-point
catching tangles in the midst of normally-woven cotton.

Exactly; the Aztec version of cloth did both duties, and thus had what

Yeah, chain is definitely one of those "part of this complete breakfast"

Effectively true, but IMO misleading.  A reaction drive just needs to
throw something out the back - the faster you throw, the less you need
to throw, but (for instance) burning fuel isn\'t part of what makes it a
reaction drive.  You could stand at the back of the ship throwing out
vegetable peelings if you didn\'t mind going veeeerrrry slooooowly (and
getting arrested for littering).

Well, it certainly won\'t be able to take off unassisted, but could it
land like the Space Shuttle?  It\'s got a streamlined hull, after all.

I recommend that you get High Guard, but in the mean time....

Type (eg BB)

size (breaks tonnage into ranges - relates to a table)
configuration (eg needle wedge etc - relates to a table)
jump drive (number relates directly to number of parsecs)
acceleration (M-Drive in G)
power plant number (must be >= highest of J-drive or M-Drive)
computer model (letters are \'bis\' or fibre optic versions)
crew number (1 is 1-9, 2 10-99 etc)

Hull Armour factor (limited by TL)
Sandcaster USP
Meson Screen USP
Nuc Damper USP
Black Globe USP
Repulsor USP

Look at how the TMl responded to Event Horizon. Did we discuss the story

We need to look at films as an entertainment medium. They will rarely
follow a book faithfully, and will often simplify the physics and plot for
effect. Look on them as eye or mind candy, something to enjoy for what they
are...

(NB One of the best recent adaptions (non-sci fi though) was the BBC\'s
version of Iain Banks \'The Crow Road\'. Before that? Maybe Interview with
the Vampire? Anyone else got any suggestions?)

That\'s doubling the results of the first 5D thrown..

I think that the difference is somewhat semantic, as you could roll a
second \'1\' in the second batch of 5D. However, I take your point. How do
you do armour?

I read your tweaks with interest. Combat seems not to happen too much at
the moment in my campaign (they all - *bar* our younger player - have a
healthy respect for guns). However, I like the T4 rules as they stand,
sufficiently lethal and fast for me!

I run initiative with the standard roll in the book, with a few mods. (D6 +
highest leadership + tactics pool if they want + brownie points if they
want(*) ).

(*) taken from MT character generation. I use them to reward players for
good roleplaying or ideas, as I\'ve tightened up on the experience
progression in skills. They are a one shot + or - 1 DM that the player can
apply as they see fit, not unlike Karma/Fate points in other games.


<snip of Ken\'s proposal>

>You might want to try this.  It adds a whole new dimension to the game.

If I get into a more military game  I will consider it, but for the moment,
the T4 system is okay.

I\'d skip that and start straight with T4.  You won\'t find it too much of
a leap from T4.

Both T4 and MT are very compatible with CT.  TNE is a whole new game
system.

T4 and MT are both improved versions of CT, IMO.

You can still find some TNE stuff pretty readily.  MT stuff is getting
harder and harder to find.  CT is even harder than that.

Check your local used book stores and game stores that carry used
items.  Sometimes you get lucky.

I know that.  You know that.  Fact is that huge amounts of special effects
make movies these days.  As a result, the director\'s vision was lots and lots
of people.

The thing that disappoints me the most about the upcoming film isn\'t the lack
of powered armor, or the lack of fascist philosophy, its the fact that the
bugs have been turned from an effective communist hive-mind (as in amazingly
good, tight and sound tactics) to slavering H.R. Giger wannabes.

I\'ll admit though, it\'ll probably be neat to see vaguely saurian pointy
clawed monsters tear apart infantrymen as explosions light up the landscape.

I said bulky, not large.  There is a difference.  There\'s a discussion group
somewhere out there on the web, and one of the members of this group was
involved somewhere in the film and he would give updates every once in awhile
about what was going on.  Apparently, the suits were too _bulky_.  As in they
didn\'t "work" right when people were wearing them.

That, and all this was being filmed in the desert.  That\'s a big point to
remember.  Not on air conditioned soundstages.

I don\'t know.  Maybe they could have put in powered armor.  That would have
been cool.  When it comes down to it though, I\'m a little glad it won\'t be in
it.  I would hate to see how much they butchered my idea of powered armor
from the book (I have visions of the horrible HORRIBLE Avalon Hill
disco-seventies concepts).

No use bitching about it now.  What\'s done is done.

You don\'t have the budget of even a *small* movie company.

Anyway, back in the 60s GE was working on some "man amplifiers".
Basicly along the lines of the cargo handler gizmo Ripley used to duel
the Queen Alien. 

I don\'t think it\'d be *that* hard to build something. It doesn\'t need
the upper body strength. And anybody who has watched shows like Beyond
2000, has seen stuff like the *human*-powered leg extenions that let
you run about 20 mph or hop like a kangaroo...

Sorry, but the energy required to split water is pretty miniscule
compared to the energy cost of travelling to and from the GG. Also, you
can\'t just throw a container into a trajectory. It has to go deep
enough to pick reach a reasonable density, and that means that it needs
*active* steering to compensate for atmospheric effects on it\'s path.
And for that matter, it has to *slow down* while scooping. You *can\'t*
scoop at orbital velocities, the stresses would tear the ship apart.

And finally, even when you get your "container" of high pressure GG
atmosphere, you still have to refine it! It\'s got a lot more than
"just" hydrogen in there.

Huh? What about the travel between the GG and the mainworld? That\'s
several *days*.

The universe afterwards doesn\'t necessarily have fundamentally
different properties - it\'s the transition that gets you in trouble.
In particular, it\'s likely to trigger an epoch of inflation, like the
last (only) phase transition did, a short fraction of a second after
the big bang. During inflation the universe expands exponentially
(instead of linearly-and-slowing-slightly, like it is now); in a 
few nanomircopico seconds the whole universe would expand by a factor
of 10^34 or so. This means that your head and feet would now be 
2x10^34 meters apart, which is generally held to be Bad. 

Fortunately there\'s no particular reason to assume that we\'re not
in a a real minimum for vacuum energy, and hence no reason to assume
that transitions are possible. (Although I saw tounge-in-cheek 
articles suggesting that the Supercollider could trigger this effect...)

Well, I thought we were past the pirates.  In any case, you depend
heavily on larger systems providing resrouces for smaller systems.
Patrolling places like the gas giants in their own system eats into
those resources.

OTOH, it might be one of the great high points of a passage.  Very
dramatic and scenic.

>(btw. in all your

>safe as refuelling at a starport

Well, since you are arguing that it wouldn\'t happen, and I am only
arguing that it is not unreasonable, then I am free to postulate
anything that is reasonable while you have a certain burden of
proof.  You could relieve yourself of that burden by only claiming
that one can set up the world in a way where gas giants wouldn\'t
be used for refueling, but I don\'t actually disagree with that
premise.

>may care about hours such a trip adds to the journey

Until you figure out the delays one encounters at a star port
(for example, only one ship can refuel at each refueling point,
but the there is a lot of room at a gas giant).

Well, I might agree that there is a problem in not distinguishing
between what it costs to actualy split water as opposed to just
sperate hydrogen from other gases.

Only if you assume the that merchant could reliably count on using

different.

>Very few merchants will have fast ships.

Well, even measly jump to ship can loose as little as about
8 hours.  (And I don\'t know that very few merchants will have
fast ships, I agree that the fixed cargo cost per jump is a
problem here, but the setting does imply that they are not
uncommon).  In any case, we don\'t have "no" ships using
gas giants, we have faster ships, ships not fully booked,
and ships passing through.  Is it "most" I don\'t know.  Is
is "some"? Yes.

about it being written without reference to ship design or combat rules;
it seems to me that large amounts of naval doctrine do depend on 
technological issues (practicality of fighters, to name one example) that
require ship design and combat rules. And I know that I personally would be
disappointed in a section on roll-playing in the Navy that didn\'t include
a single naval ship design - or even some clues as to what a typical naval
ship looks like. (How big is a TL-12 battleship? Does the nascent 
Imperium use battleriders? That sort of thing.)

THe playing-your-own FFW does sound fairly cool (especially if it fixes
the problems with bombardment/SDB combat in the original FFW)(Ground
forces and SDB forces took damage as a percentage, not a absolute value, so
it was just as easy to fry a 500-point corps-sized unit from orbit as a
1-point battalion.) 

Anyway, overall it sounds at least as interesting as PE.
Isn\'t it ironic (or possibly just depressing) that many o fthe best T4
supplements are those that are completely decoupled from the T4 rules?

1e8-5e10.  I usually use G as the billion prefix, rather than B, and I use
the US billion, wich is 1000 million, rahter than the European billion,
which is a million million.  Sorry for not making this clear.

Something like this has to be true, as the ZS was just too big an oppoonent

Guys, call me crazy, but I don\'t think the Conquestadors wore chainmail.
Chainmail was "out of fashion" by that time, wasn\'t it?

They wore breastplates and helments, but little else in the way of actual
armor, if I recall correctly.  They might have ditched the breastplate too
by that time.

Yes, that\'s true.  The nobility of the Second Empire\'s nobles had already
slipped somewhat by the time of _King David\'s Spaceship_, I do believe.

Frankly, I doubt it.  However, I think that during the early days of 3I
*many* (but not most) leaders, whether nobles or commoners, were driven by
a sense of (sp for sure!)  "noblesse oblige."  I think it would be most
evident in young, dynamic, growing societies, and less evident in large,
older, more static societies.

I don\'t know.  It really *seems* like there has been a drop in the social
consciousness and morality (if not the actual intelligence) of our
children..excepting the children of our list members, of course. ;-> That\'s
probably not true, just me getting closer to being a "grumpy old coot"..I

No, no, yes and no.

David Stockman "The triumph of politics" p297. "When fully implemented the
<Reagan Administration> DOD plan would cost 7.5% of GDP. That was not too
much. We had spent far more of our national defense, 8 to 10 percent, in
the 1950s and 1960s". Dave Stockman was heading up OMB under Reagan, so I
trust his numbers.

Now, the only place defense spending can come out of is taxes. You can levy
em directly, indirectly or thru government ownership of means of
production, but at the end of the day taxes is what they all are.

Also, if you check PE you get some pretty obscene rates of taxation with
certain government types - I am thinking of civil service and impersonal
bureaucracies.

Yes, most people will have the same relationship to starships that most
people had to aircraft in the twenties - we recognise their existance, but
who can afford it when a jump-1 costs about a years income ?

However, every world that came out of the Long Night will have cultural
memories of pirates and reavers. Look at the number of old Indian forts in
the Midwest, and look at when the military bases built there got
decommissioned.

As to the majoity of people not seeing a spaceship, nope. No way. Space
travel is at the heart of the Imperium. Just becasue you cant aford it
doesnt mean you dont go to the starport and wave goodbye to Cousin Beth,
who got accepted into the Marines and is shipping off to Boot Camp on a
planet a whole 6 parsecs away ...

In-system travel is also reasonably affordable, especially with TL11
thruster plates linked up to the abomination known as Fusion Plus.

Nope. See above. As for army/navy shares, check the size of the Royal Navy
vs the size of the British Army in the heyday of Empire. The British Empire
didnt have an army, becasue with naval dominance it didnt need one. Same
within Imperial space. I think it reasonable that the IN has as many ships
of the line as the Imperial Marines have battallions.

*thinks* Australia is a TL7-8 country, 19 million people, and I think we
have an army of four 700 men battallions, and I think twelve tanks. OK, our
navy and air force are big by regional standards, but I dont see people
demanding a bigger standing army.

The base 10%, doubled for imported high-tech equipment as per Striker, and
adding 10% to cover supporting all those well-connected drones at Sector
HQ, contracting Famile Spofulam for R+D and doing ship maintainence three
times as well as civilians do.

The point of picking 30% was to take a ridiculous maintainence number and
prove you can *still* have enough of a fleet to secure the subsector from
one hi-pop, moderate tech world.

History is full of weapon systems that were essentially useless, but kept
for various reasons. Andy Fishers comment on the RN\'s Reserve Fleet ("A
miser\'s hoard of useless junk ... a modern armoured cruiser would lap them
up like an armadillo on an anthill") comes to mind.

The INH was a never(?) published work, I think By HIWG.  I inherited it some
yoears ago from a friend.  (I do not know much about it myself).  It is a
mix of both old and new material, The charts in question are an expansion of
those in Striker.  I thought it would provide lower figure than those in
TCS.  (Which it does if you assume that we are talking about the imperium) 
If it was ever called Imperial squadrons, I do not know-But I would like to
know.
BTW It is notaeable that you get very different sized fleets depending on
the costs of the ships, as claculated using different protocols, i.e.
TNE,MT, CT.

Jump Drives do _not_ improve in fuel efficency in MT until TL 17.  MT
states (Referee\'s Manual pg 64) Fuel Volume per jump unit (ie
displacement ton of jump drive) "Fuel Volume at TL 9 to 16: x5 (67.5 kl
per jump unit"  In MT jump drives between TL 9 and 16 use 5 times the
drive volume in fuel.  Jump drives do not reduce in volume in MT at any
TL (Ref\'s Manual pg 64).

Jump Drives (of the same jump number) do _not_ improve in fuel efficency
in TNE at all.  FF&S says (pg 42) "Jump drive machinery requirements are
tied to the volume of the hull and the maximum distance the hull is
capable of jumping...The volume of the jump drive, as a percentage of
the total volume of the ship is equal to 1 plus the maximum jump number
in parsecs [this formula gives the exact same results as MT\'s table
does] ....Jump drives require fuel, displacement mass, and coolant, all
of which are collectively called jump fuel (liquid hydrogen being used
for all three functions)  The fuel necessary for a jump of 1 parsec is
equal to the total volume of the jump drive machinery multiplied by 5
and divided by the ships maximum jump number.

This rule means that a ship which is capable of a higher jump will use
less fuel for a jump of the same distance as a less capable ship. 
However this has nothing to do with Tech level.  A TL 16 TNE Jump 1 ship
will use exactly the same ammount of fuel for a jump 1 as a TL 9 jump 1
ship will. A TL 11 jump 2 ship of the same size will use less fuel for a
1 parsec jump than this TL 16 jump 1 ship will.

There are several options, depending on why you want to compare them...

File Assistant:

An application that first came with powerbooks which compares files and 
folders, synchronizing them to the most recent versions. I believe that 
the latest system software disks allow you to install it as well...

File Buddy:

imho, the most straightforward option if you\'re just looking for a strict 
"yes" or "no" answer to the question "Are these files the same?" It\'s 
shareware and does a plethora of other houskeeping chores like finding

Spring Cleaning:

Along the lines of File Buddy, but it\'s commercial software from Aladdin 
Systems. Cleans the system folder, finds duplicate files giving you the 
option of selecting some for deletion, etc.

ResCompare:

A handy little shareware item that allows you to compare the resource and 
data forks of a file and create an updater for them. So if you have 
created a newer version of your software and want to distribute a patch 
to update an older version to save download time/disk space, you can use 
this.


I know there\'s more. BBEdit is excellent at straight text file 
comparison, it gives a super-cool list of what\'s different in each file, 
allows multiple file comparisons, and is the greatest plain text editor 
around -- with grep search and replace and all that fun stuff.  It the 
cat\'s meow for manipulation of Traveller sector data and such. It makes a 
totally boffo html editor. I wish Windows had something similar, it sure 
would be useful at work...

I suspect that "File Buddy" would do the trick for you, since you just 
want to check to see whether the files are the same or not. You could 
find it at your local info-mac mirror, I\'m sure. Or www.filez.com. Or, my 
personal favourite for keeping track of the newest and latest versions of 
commercial and shareware software: www.versiontracker.com.

If you look at the map in MT\'s Referee\'s Manual (pg 102) of Cultural
Regions of the Imperium you will see that the Ilelish Cultural region
"Regions which have historically developed independant cultures and
which have retained their cultural identity iunder the Imperium."
occupies subsectors B,C,F, and G of Illelish Sector while the main
battlefields of the Illelish Revolt (from Wars of the Imperium Map -
MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia inside front cover) indicates that the area
of the Ilelish Revolt (418 to 435) was subsectors N & O of Gushmege and
subsectors A,B,C,G, and H of Illelish.  (note thet MT refers to the
Sector as Illelish with 3 l\'s and the culture & war as Ilelish with only
2 l\'s).  This similarity of area is presumably _not_ a coincidence.

Therefore I think the whole question of:

> Is the Ileish Revolt a bunch of
> selfish guys revolting against the noble nobles (and being heroically
> outfought) or a bunch of noble guys revolting against the selfish     > nobles (and being brutally crushed)?

will depend on what your assesment of the Ilelish culture is.  We do not
have a good canonical sense of what the Ilelish culture is like so it
will be difficult to make this decision.  MT\'s depiction of Dulinor may
and does provide some information about Ilelish culture but he was also
influenced by the unusual culture of his home planet Dlan.

I will note that in my Third Imperium the Ilelish Pacification Campaigns
(76 to 120 is the date for the pacification campaigns in general) is
"a bunch of noble guys revolting against the selfish nobles (and being
brutally crushed)."

The Ilelish Pacification Campaign took place in subsectors G,J,K, and L
of Zarushagar while the Darmine Cultural region occupies subsectors
J,K,O, and P of Zarushagar.  It seems clear to me that a good part of
the Ilelish Pacification Campaign was the pacification of the Darmine.

The Darmine (a minor human race), as developed by me, and as posted here
a few months ago, had traditionally not gotten along with the Vilani.
They had been culturally oppresed during the First Imperium and welcomed
the Second Imperium as liberators.  The Third Imperium seems to be
continuing in the intolerant mode of the First Imperium.

The Darmine are unusual looking, have a strange (and annoying to
outsiders) religion based on numerology, and have a tendancy to be
fairly sharp traders.  In the First Imperium they occupied a cultural
niche somewhat akin to that of the Chinese in southeast asia or the jews
in medieval Europe.  They were persecuted and disproportionately
merchantile.

Good point.  In my sentence above, I was trying to clue my players in
(who have never played Traveller before our campaign--and I\'m slowly
feeding them new things as we go along) as to what a reactionless drive
is.

I was trying to let them know with an explanation they would
understand--lowest common denominator approach.

For one of my players, this is really easy to do.  Heck, he knows more
about real science than I do (which isn\'t saying a lot).  Two of my
players are about my speed, and one is totally clueless.  He didn\'t even
know what "bow" and "aft" meant before we started playing this game.

As I stated in my first March Harrier post, I\'m writing these March
Harrier posts in very clear, simple, layman\'s terms.

When you are trying to explain reactionless drives, my players will draw
a blank.  They don\'t know what "reactionless" means.  A rocket is a
"reaction" based drive, and everybody knows what a rocket is, so I used
that as my example.

Well, actually, this is where I think the Traveller rules are vague. 
Since the March Harrier is not only a streamlined hull, but also an
airframe, you are probably right.

But, as I stated in the March Harrier post, the planet\'s gravity is only
a factor for a ship taking off from the planet and, to a lesser degree,
when the ship is landing.

I read it like this:  the M-Drive blasts the ship off planet out of the
planet\'s gravitational pull.  The M-Drive also controls landings as the
ship gets into the planet\'s grav field.

Once the ship is within range to use its contra-grav lifters, which I
read as units that push against the gravitational field of the planet,
the planet\'s gravity is really no longer a factor.  The ship can land
using the contra-grav lifters.

I\'d wing this in a game if we came upon a very, very high-G planet.  If
they were landing, I\'d probably make some sort of roll for the PC\'s to
maintain control of the vessel as the ship switches from the M-Drive to
the contral grav lifters.  If they missed the roll, I\'d make them go out
of control, but I\'d still give them another shot of regaining control,
using the contra-grav lifters, before they smashed into the surface.

With taking off, I\'d say it is not possible to take off from a world
with a higher G rating than the ship\'s overdrived M-Drive.

But, I could also see an argument stating that the ship\'s contra-grav
lifters could push the ship away from the planet enough for the G field
to weaken, allowing the PC\'s to engage the M-Drive and speed away.

I\'d probably give them some sort of a roll on this if this happened in a
game.

What are your thoughts on this?

So, you are saying that you allow a player to throw 10D?  Or you roll 5D
and double the results?

It\'s not really semantic.  There\'s another difference you might not be
considering, besides the "1" rolls.  

Let\'s say a weapon does 3D damage, and we are using autofire.  If you
roll 6D, you could roll low enough for a character to survive and remain
conscious (however unlikely) if his stats are high enough.

Remember that each die comes off of one stat.

If you roll 3D and you double the damage, as I read the rule, then you
end up with the possibility of one die being a 6, which, doubled, will
become a 12.

It\'s doubtful that most characters can remain conscious with a blow of
12 points to one characteristic.

Do you see what I\'m getting at?  The two methods are very similar, but
there are subtle differences.


Follow my example:

Fred   Str 4, Dex 5,  End 7

He gets hit with a 2D autofire weapon.



Your method:   damage is rolled as 4D

You roll complete average on each of the 4 dice:  3, 3, 3, 3 (total of
12 points)

Player takes 3 points from Str, 3 points from Dex, and 6 points from End
(using normal wound damage point rules, keeping the whole die together).

Fred ends up with these stats:  Str 1, Dex 2, End 1.  He\'s still
conscious, up and kicking.


Now, compare this to my doubling method, which is how I read the rule in
the book.  This doubling will be much more deadly for Fred.



My method:  damage is rolled as 2D doubled.

You roll complete average on each of the 2 die: 3, 3

This is doubled to 6, 6 because of autofire (total of 12 points)

Fred needs to keep the die together.  He takes off 6 points from his
End, leaving him one point, but now he\'s in trouble.  He\'s got 6 more
points he needs to take off, and he doesn\'t have a stat high enough to
prevent him from going unconscious.  He take it on his Dex, with the
remaining point on his Str.

This leaves Fred looking like this:  Str 3, Dex 0, End 1.

As you can see, Fred is in a much worse condition using this system
rather than your increasing the dice thrown.

Given this, you can probably see that the difference is much more than
just "half a dozen of one, 12 of the other."

In your case, with the same amount of damage, Fred stands and acts.  In
my case, Fred is out for the count, possibly killed by a coup d\' gras.

> However, I take your point. How do
> you do armour?

For autofire?  I read the rule like this:  You figure penetration first,
then you double any damage that penetrates.

Example.  Fred is wearing AV 3 Diplo armor.  He\'s hit with 4D.  4-3=1. 
1 damage die penetrates, and now this is thrown and the result doubled
(I throw one die and get a 2.  The damage to the character is one die of
4 points that must be taken from one stat).

I don\'t think I posted my Snapshot Tweaks.  You\'re probably thinking
about my hand to hand combat tweaks.

Snapshot doesn\'t really do anything for the game except assign costs to
every action taken.  In this way, you can take a lot of the guess work
out of the game concerning how much a character can accomplish in the 6
second round.

It\'s takes a bit of getting used to, but now that I have, I love it (and
so do my players).  And, it cuts down on a lot of the discussion as to
what a character can do in those 6 seconds.  Too many times,the GM
thinks 6 seconds is such a short time, and the players are thinking that
it is ample time to do all that they want to do in one round.  Snapshot
solves all of that--a player probably has enough time to do all that he
wants in a round, but the expense to him is that he\'s probably going to
go later in the round allowing the bad guys to shoot at and possible
kill him first.

Or, the player can make a quick action, improving the chance that he\'ll
probably go first and get the drop on his opponent.

I allow tactics pool too, but I do the T4 version (optional rule) where
once the tactics points are used, they are gone for the engagement.

Funny!  I use brownie points too, although I only allow them during
character generation.  A player can keep the brownie points he receives
in chargen, if he doesn\'t use them, and he is allowed to use them in
normal play--but, I don\'t award them in the game.  Once they are gone,
they are gone.

Given that they are a one time shot, I allow brownie points to do some
pretty miraculous things, probably more like the Fate points you are
talking about.

Erk....not quite, although I\'m going from memory here - if anyone really
cares I\'ll dig out my copy of the 1995 White Paper.  As of \'95, the figure
was (roughly) 8,000 in the sharp end of the army, and about 70 Leopard
tanks.  Also about 200-300 APC\'s (old M113\'s I believe), and X Light
Armoured Vehicles (bloody memory).

Then again, that 8,000 figure might include reserves.

As an aside, defence spending in 1997-98 is of GDP.  There\'s apparently a
substantial push by the Defence Minister to get that back up to around 2.5%
- - but where the government is going to find another 3 odd billion is
anybody\'s guess (maybe they\'ll get it in repaid travel allowances).

Interesting article in last mopnths Oz Aviation, where the author
recommends buying 50-80 F-22\'s from 2005 onwards to replace the F/A-18\'s
and F-111\'s (from 2015).

ObTrav - I imagine a lot of Imperial client-states have a relationship with
the Imperium similar to that between the US and Oz.  Close defense ties,
lots of Imperial equipment in local inventories (cheaper than developing it
yourself), Imperial facilities in client states, Imperial ships visiting
local starports. Hmmmm....that gives me a few ideas....

100, 000s MCr for Battleship sized mounts, (And a navy is a lot more cost

I think that they are slightly more expansive than Striker.  An extra line

BTW  I think I recall reading somewhere that GNP in the imperium spent on

reduce still further the budget.

Tricky issue.

Also in a similar vein, CSC allows "magnetic shielding" of vehicle

Perhaps my 108 page bibliography put Andy right off the format!

Having said that though it would seem to be one option.  That, or not
having 101 religions to begin with.  What about, say, 76 or something?
(Now why does that number spring to mind?!)

It\'s Andy\'s call however and it does seem that he\'s judged the books so far
very well.


Hmmm, call me Mr On the Fence.

There *isn\'t* a "second batch of 5d". You double the results of the

Well, I\'d not be surprised to find that the "wrong" movement was

Actually, they aren\'t as horrble as you\'d think. They can easily run into
50% or more, but that is applied to the tax base, which is the total
production of the world divided by the Culture (+1). In other words, if you
have a Culture score of 9 then the tax base is total wealth produced divided
by 10, so the 50% tax is actually only 5% of total wealth produced. So PE
propably provide less money for the navy than TCS, which is fine by me -- I
just haven\'t gotten around to doing the necessary sums to work with PE 
figures yet. (OTOH a world with a Culture of 1 could have taxes of 25% or
more).

I don\'t think \'heavily\' is the proper word. I rely on the larger systems
providing 0.1% (or possibly 0.2%) of their resources for smaller systems.
That\'s not heavily. I really think that the remaining 99.9 or 99.8% of
their forces should be enough to cover most Gas Giants.

True enough, but don\'t you think doing power dives into an Gas Giant
atmosphere is apt to be a teeny bit more hazardous than a sedate trip
down to a starport?

The cracking can be done by the ship itself. Wilderness refuelling involves
setting down in a body of water and getting the fuel. That\'s something you
can do even without a fuel purifier plant.

Not really. Adding an avoidable delay to all the unavoidable ones can\'t
help but decrease earnings in the long run. It\'s true that by the law
of averages the unavoidable delays will sometimes dovetail with the
avoidable one  --  but just as often the avoidable delay will lead to
_new_ unavoidable ones.

I can\'t parse that sentense. What do you mean?

A 6G jump-1 freighter has about 17% less cargo space and costs about 2.6
more than a 1G jump-1 freighter. That makes freight charges more than 3
times those of the 1G ship. How often do you think that ten and a quarter
hours in delivery times (the difference a 6G drive makes over a 1G when 
going to and from a size 8 world) would make enough of a difference to
warrant paying 3 times as much for delivery? How common do you think
such ships would be? And, as I mentioned before, such a ship would lose
3 times as much for each hour it lost by refuelling at a Gas Giant
instead of at an ordinary world. Fast merchants would be very uncommon
and even less inclined to use Gas Giant refuelling than ordinary ships.

No. They lose correspondingly more.

No, they will be even more eager to get to their destination quickly and
get some new bookings.

No, they will be as eager as any other to get their destination and get
a new cargo.

Not even close.

"Some" as in "more than zero", agreed. "Some" as in "more than very, very
few"... I think not.

Conquistadors didn\'t wear mail. They wore breastplates, and full plate (I
forget the technical terms.)
The spanish greatly feared only the Mexica slings, as the impact could dent
even the best spanish Morion. The Spaniards started wearing the padded
armour of the Mexica because of the incredible problems with heat the foot
troopers faced in the lowlands. The only damage the mexica maquahuital (sp?)
could do was blunt impact on the spanish steel.

Obsidian is very sharp. I took an anthropology class where a guest prof
knapped some tools. I asked for and got to keep the tools. I threw them out
a couple days later as I was tired of brushing the damn thing and slicing my
hands open. Just carrying them back to residence resulted in cuts that hurt
like paper cuts but were deeper and wider. But, if I had been wearing
butchers\' chainmail, I would not have been harmed at all. The anth prof had
done that, and I gained one hell of a lot of respect for our stone age
ancestors. Either in their willingness to slash their hands to ribbons for a
fur coat or just sheer thickness of the skin on their hands

Yes, but what do the 50s and 60s and the Reagan 80s all have in common?
 There was a fully active cold war in effect.  Then the excesses of the
Reagan 80s came out, and then they dropped the military tax rate.  Same thing
post Vietnam I believe.

I will admit that in times of threat (and perceived threat) the tax rates
will be higher.

Besides, we in the U.S. _saw_ what the money was being spent on.  The average
person from the average planet is never even going to see the starships it
has been taxed for.

That is, under your "regime", 5% of someone\'s tax money is going down a black
hole.

I don\'t disagree here.  People will put up with more taxation however with a
parade of "The Day After"s, "Red Dawn"s and "Rocky IV"s and whatever that
miniseries on the Soviet occupation of the U.S. was called, dancing in front
of their eyes.

Also, there is a second way of getting such money.  Loans, loans and more
loans.  And *surprise*, political discussions aside, look how much in debt
the Reagan 80s put the US!

I don\'t think "airplanes in the 1920s" is the proper analogy.  I don\'t think
we\'ve even have an analogy in 20th c. America.  Hell, I don\'t think we have a
proper analogy period.

Yes, these things were tangible and nearby and real, which to the average 3rd
Imperial spaceships would NOT be.  This works both ways, pirates and reavers
probably did very few horrible things to the planetbound population.  EXCEPT
possibly have a base.  Ask the Carribean Islands about their cultural
memories of Pirates...  If you can\'t do that, I\'ll tell you :)  There are all
kinds of garish books about pirates, pirates, and more pirates.  The lives of
the pirates, the ships of the pirates, the flags of the pirates, hell, when I
was there I even bought a coffee mug with the histories of several pirates on
it.  So it depends, really.  On the other hand, these same worlds may have
cultural memories of the Third Imperium "nuking them from orbit" and seeding
the world with irradiated salts and doing all the good things they did to
_suspected_ pirate bases in the early 3rd Imperium.

You say tomay-to, I say tomah-to.  I don\'t think that the Traveller character

 I don\'t think marines would be all that common...  As I already stated (in

armies.

I said starships, not spaceships (there is a difference in Trav).  Besides,
the extended system generation tables very rarely give any place to travel
_to_ within a system.  Although it is affordable, it doesn\'t seem to be to
needed.  With the exception of a sojourn to the pleasure moons of Hieronymous
Alpha, I don\'t see the average Imperial citizen hitting the space lanes any
time soon.

I agree *surprise*.  You neglected to read what I was saying.  I don\'t think
the Imperium has a large army (I think I even stated that in that message).
 However, people will want to have a _local_ army.  A planetwide army "just
in case", and this will be fielded from the local populace.  It won\'t be very
large (under a percent of the world population probably), but it would be
there.

Wet navy and air force are included in this "standing army".  I didn\'t mean
literally grunts and infantrymen.  In fact, I think I may have said "local
army, wet navy, and aerospace force" once or twice in my message.

No, I was just wondering why you were bandying around this number, and if it
was from a real source.  Does anyone happen to know the costs of maintenance
and support/logistics in the United States military?  I would think that it
would be somewhat high (once you add in all of the administration that is).

CT, however, is not one of these.  Not only did they have fighters, they had
many ship designs in use that utilized them to great effect.  Sorry.

Unfortunately annual maintenance takes two weeks, not one, so maintenance
would account for quite a bit more. I\'m going to assume a tighter sceduling
of ships for maintenance and divide by 25 rather than 22.5. That would give:

Shipyard utilization:
 	New construction: 2.5% of 3,000 million tons =  75 million tons.
 	Maintenance: 3,000 million tons/25 =           120 million tons
	Excess capacity:			       158 million tons

for a final result of 353 million tons.

	Hm.  Thought hadn\'t occurred to me.  Probably, a smoothbore barrel
would be neccessary, and then rather than futz around with scaling down
rockets, just come up with a few handwaved figures for what % of the
propellant charge gets burned per meter.  You\'d just have to calculate the
recoil based on what percentage was burned in-barrel.  The ModBlen number
would be ignored.

	Calculating damage would also be be interesting and would vary
depending on range; initial damage at close range would be low, but
unarmoured targets would still take a real beating from the combustion of
the remaining propellant in-target.  I\'d suggest using the round\'s
effective energy plus 50% of joules\' worth of unburnt propellant in
calculating soft-target damage until propellant is burned out, then going
with straight effective energy.

	I suspect that these things would be wildly inaccurate, unless you
wanted to handwave cost&mass figures for smart ammo.

	It\'s too bad I\'ve got an exam Wednesday; otherwise I\'d whomp one up
right now.

A port = 60 square miles, 1200 berths, 5 billion Cr
...
E port = 0.5 square miles, 6 berths, 15 million Cr

This is the cost that a "property developer" would pay for a civilian 
starport; it does not include the expenses incured by shopkeepers in 
stocking shelves, nor the installation of the LSP ship construction 
equipment.  It does include the infrastructure, within the starport, to 
encourage bussinesses to set up.

If berthing fees were the only way to repay starports, it would require 
1000 years (at least).  The Imperium allow the operators to have fuel 
prices of around 500 Cr/T, as this allows the starport to repay its 
investment over a reasonable period without imposing "import taxes" on 
freight and cargo.

See end of message for suggested "sterile area" around the main 
starport.
===========

Now onto the long discussion:

Pocket Empires gives costs for starports - but these are very high.  
However, upgrading your starport is very useful for HiPop worlds in 
Pocket Empires, due to the way the economic model works.

X to E   free
E to D   6 billion Cr
...
B to A   12,000 billion Cr, spread over 30 years

I try to rationalise these enormous costs by noting that Pocket Empires 
is looking at the cost to the economy as a whole, including those 
shopkeepers, customs officers, ship building facilities, but I still 
come up with a fraction of this number.  However, if the PE "starport" 
also represents the subsidised merchant fleet, SDB and other huge costs, 
then 10 trillion credits for a class A starport seems reasonable.  These 
costs are repayed by the increased trade the world sees (which includes 
repayment of starship loans, attracting trade from other worlds do to 
efficient anti-piracy partols with those SBD\'s and so on).  Because I 
like to explain all Traveller material in "hard(ish) science" terms, 
this interpretation has become my own personal version of "canon".


Leroy W Gautney (of the TML) had an article in the Journal of the 
Travellers Aid Society, issue 22, about estimating the number of berths 
at a starport, which boils down to:

(Pop - portDM)D6

portDM = 0 for A, 1 for B, ..., 4 for E

In addition each D6 has a -1 DM for Starport D and E or a +1 DM for A.

Example: pop 9, port A rolls 9D6 + 9 for berths
Example: pop 7, port B rolls 6D6
Example: pop 4, port D rolls 1D6 - 1


World Builders Handbook seems likely to have a rule for starport berths 
(the Excel spreadsheet version I downloaded from the web does, at 
least), but these seem very low to me ... around 20 berths at an A 
class starport, with a similar number at any obital facility.


Andy Lilly (of CORE fame) keeps dropping hints about a "101" book about 
starports which will have these sorts of rules in.  I suggest we send 
begging e-mails to Andy to get this published :-) or for Andy to post 
his old "house rules" to the TML.


Another approach, for those with Pocket Empires and Trillion Credit 
Squadron (or similar), is to work out the likely trade of freight, 
cargo, ship building and ship maintenace to a given system.  The PE 
freight figures look as if they will be enormous for high-Pop worlds.  
This is on my long "to do" list, but has not yet risen near the top!  
For those who are interested, here is some of my background info and 
the calculations to support 1200 berths at an A-port.


If we consider Britain in 1880, a time of huge growth in steel ship 
building, was building 980 steam ships per year of an average 500 
displacment tons each, with a total (steam powered) merchant marine of 
2.7 million tons (i.e. 5x the shipyard capacity).  The wooden sailing 
ships were in strong decline at that time (but still being built ... I 
believe there was a little contre-temps in New England about tea 
Clippers a few years earlier!).  Over the next 50 years ship sizes rose 
to 5,000 tones (the first oil tankers) to 50,000 tons (including the 
early 80,000 ton passenger liners in the 1930\'s).  Shipbuilding 
workforce rose from 54,000 in 1880 (making 500,000 tons/year) to 
200,000 in 1913 with 580 berths (estimated capacity: over 2,000,000 
tons per year). 

Although Britain supplied the majority of the world\'s ships around 
1900, the situation could not last.  The British shipbuilding workforce 
was far too large - the ship markets were glutted with new ships and 
world recession coupled with overseas competition led to large numbers 
of unemployed, highly skilled, craftsmen ... the grim faces of the 
Jarrow marchers painted a picture of great hardship in 1935.  The 
186,000 tons of "scrap and build" subsidies given by the British 
Government in 1935 was less than 10% of the shipyard capacity.

Average ship size (new construction, excludes sail ships)
1880 -    500 tons
1890 -  1,600 tons
1930 -  5,000 tons (about the only size of ship built in that period)
1950 - 12,000 tons

Biggest ships
1886 - first 5,000 ton oil tanker
1913 - ??? first 15,000 ton oil tanker
1930s - 80,000 (Cunard\'s two huge liners, the Queen Mary and Queen 
Elizabeth, I believe)


If we compare the shipyard capacity of 1935 Britain (2,000,000 tons - 
say 4,000,000 m3 in Traveller terms, population of 40 million - 
roughly) we can see that the capacity (100 m3 per 1000 population) is 
much higer than the Traveller figure of 14 m3 per 1000 population.  
However, history shows that the 1935 capacity was unsustainable in the 
long term.

Let us say that the Traveller figure of 14 m3 (1 T) per 1000 pop is 
reflects the average figure for a stable Third Imperium economy, but 
that war-mongering Pocket Emperors with their pocket Battleships (:-) 
can have up to 10x this figure in the short term, with economic 
problems (unemployment) to follow when (if) the war stops.

Let us make another comparison, if shipyards build 4,000,000 m3 per 
year with an average starship life of 50 years, we will have an 
operational fleet size of 200 million m3 (15 million T) of ships - 
enough for 4 /Tigress/ BatRons or *lots* of Free Traders in the 
merchant fleet.  Mind you, 4 BatRons would cost 1.1 Trillion credits 
per year to maintain (eqivalent to the Naval tax on 2.3 billion 
people).  Now, 4,000,000 m3 of shipyard capacity "needs" a pop of 285 
million to support it, so our theortial world of 2.3 billion people 
will have a ship building capacity of 8x the Naval force they can 
afford, indicating that the merchant fleet is 7x larger than the naval 
fleet.  Now, a ratio of 7 between merchant and naval does not seem 
unreasonable to be (although I would have expected an even higher 
ratio), so I\'m willing to accept that the Traveller numbers make rough 
sense.

If we further assume that merchant ships are, on average, 5x smaller 
than Navy ships, we have around 35 merchants for each Naval ship.  Now, 
if only 1/1000th of those are for piracy suppression then <aargh, wrong 
thread>.

Ok, back to starport size.  A HiPop world with an A starport will have 
around 15 x 7 = 105 million T of merchant ships registered at that 
world.  If we spread those ships over a (say) 36-world trading main, as 
one world in 36 is roughly right for A-port HiPop, then each ship in 
the merchant fleet will visit the world at roughly once every 72 weeks 
(one week in jump, one week in port, 36 worlds).  Some destinations are 
more favoured, so let us increase our main world visits to once every 
52 weeks.  So 105 million T per year visit the world for (say) one 
week, or arond 2 million T of ships in port at any given time.  How big 
is an "average" merchant ship - 5000 T? 200 T?

When we take into acount that many of the ships are local (non-jump) 
shuttles and the like we can adjust the starship berth requirements 
down by a factor of, perhaps, 3 to 10.

Case 1: 1000 T average size, 10% of traffic is starships =   200 berths
Case 2:  500 T average size, 30% of traffic is starships = 1,200 berths

Leroy\'s rules for a world with 2 billion pop and an A-class starport 
give an average of 45 berths.  WBH gives 20 berths.

How busy do you feel a starport should be - 1200 berths (possible 
spread over several locations) is one departure every 6 minutes of the 
day; 200 berths is one every 40 minutes; 45 berths is one every 4 
hours; 20 berths is only 3 per day.

I cannot imagine a HiPop world surviving on 3 interstellar departures 
each day; even 30 per day (200 berths) seems to me to represent 
relatively little trade.  100 to 200 departures per day (1200 berths) 
seems to fit my mental picture of a busy HiPop "economic powerhouse" 
and also seems to fit the Traveller economic model.

Using this sort of analysis, some of those Pop 5 or 6 backwater worlds 
will see 1 ship per week and probably only have 3 to 6 berths.  Real 
low-trade places, invariably targetted by rogue asteroids, will see one 
ship every month.  Thus, it is extremely likely (in an RPG) that the 
players will have the only ship capable of intercepting the 
aforementioned asteroid before it obliterates the Pop 5, starport E 
world just ahead.


Based on airport and motorway construction, I estimate construction 
costs for most of the starport will be around 50 million Cr per square 
mile, but this will vary depending on shup building costs, customs halls 
and so on.  There is likely to be a "no-go" band of one to five miles 
surronding the starport (say, Law Level/2 km??), which will need to be 
fenced and patrolled.  I have not included this "sterile" area in the 
area figures at the start of this message.

From 1776 to 1940, the U.S. averaged 2.2% of its GDP in defense spending,
with small blips during it\'s major wars, most notably 1861-1865 and
1917-1918.  Only after the development of Eisenhower\'s \'Military-Industrial
Complex\' did the rate go up to an average of 5.7% for the period 1946-1991.
 Note that the Soviet Union spent somewhere between 6.5% (their public
figure) and 12.1% (CIA figure) during the same 45-year period.  Since 1988,
however, defense spending in both systems has dramatically been cut back,
and the expectation of several noted military affairs experts is that in
the U.S., it will trend back toward the historical figure, perhaps
levelling off at about 3%.

I really don\'t think that the U.S. is a decent indicator of Third Imperium
politics or spending, however, since the 3I is a fuedal aristocracy, with
financial power resting at the "local" level.  I think that the Imperial
budget would be constrained in ways that that of the U.S. is not, and would
expect significantly lower Imperium-wide expenditures and larger
concentrations on the sector and sub-sector navies, largely in the form of
defensive installations such as SDBs.

There is also the problem of heat exhaustion.  The film was made out in the
desert.  They had problems with actors and extras dropping as it was.  Now
put \'em in heavy plastic suits.

   There are several web sites out detailing the long rumor history on this
film.  They shouldn\'t be too hard to find.  If you have read the book,
don\'t expect to see much of in the film.

    'body' => 'The capability to overdrive maneuver drives isn\'t really canon any more 
in T4; DGP just added it to let 1-G ships take off on >1G worlds, without
thinking too much about consequences (why don\'t people use this to evade
during combat?). Thruster plates also only provide thrust in one direction
now. However, most ships have an auxilliary contragrav, which allows takeoff
even for 1-G ships. There are several different design combinations that will
get you off the ground these days:

(1) Airframe ships with a runway on a planet with atmosphere can take off/land
horizontally on the runway, pretty much no matter how little thrust
their engines provide. Even if the engine only provides 1G and the local
gravity is >1G, they can still climb like an airplane to very high
altitude and then (as they run out of air) accelerate into orbit or escape
(see below.)

(2) Any ship with contragrav thrusters producing more than the local gravity
can take off vertically. It can then use either the contragrav or its thrusters
to accelerate rapidly to orbital or escape velocity (it\'ll have to do this
before it reaches the 10-diameter limit and contragrav falls off, of course,
or use only its thrusters.)

(3) Any ship with thruster plates producing more than the local gravity
can also take off vertically - assuming it\'s oriented so that it\'s thruster
plates fire vertically, which a lot of ships aren\'t. (A classic scout,
for example, would have to be hoisted up until it\'s standing on its tail for
this approach to work.)

(2) is the most common approach. (1) requires an airframe hull and a long
runway, (2) and (3) only require a streamlined hull.

I should note that there\'s no need for your engines to keep firing all the 
way until you\'re out of the planets gravity. What matters is velocity; 
if you achieve escape velocity, and you\'re high enough up that there
isn\'t much atmosphere in the way, you\'ll escape from the planets gravity
even if you switch the engines off.

Consider the case (1) above. The ship might be able to climb up to 20,000 
meters and reach a velocity of 1-2 km/s with its wings providing lift. 
Imagine that the wings then retracted. The ship will start plummeting towards
the planet even as it\'s accelerating forwards. However, once it\'s accelerated
to 8km/s, it\'s in orbit, and won\'t fall any lower. That\'ll take 600 seconds 
or so at 1 G - during which it\'ll follow a sort of arching trajectory - 
and if this is done right it\'ll reach orbital velocity before it hits the
ground. (The actual trajectories are complicated, and of course the wings
provide some lift - my point is that if you\'re far enough away from the
ground you can reach orbit even with an engine that provides less thrust
than the local gravity.) 

Landing an airframe ship is even easier - the space shuttle manages to land
even though it has only a tiny amount of thrust from it\'s OMS to de-orbit
and no power for the landing. Airframe ships in orbit can slow down somewhat
with their thrusters and then land like the shuttle does - ballistic re-entry
most of the way down and then turning the engines back on and flying like an
airplane to a landing site. Ships with contra-grav or sufficiently powerful
thrusters can land using the reverse of (2) or (3) above.

Hmm, UK 1997. As a crude estimate, the base rate of Tax (including National
Insurance) must be somewhere around 30%, plus pension contributions at say
5%. (I just figured that I pay 32% out before I get paid). On top of this
you plus VAT (sales tax) at 17.5% on many purchases.

No doubt that some of our accountant friends could give a better breakdown.

That depends on if there\'s armour involved, but I\'m tending more to roll

Okay, I get your point. All of the hits considered were first hits in
combat ie 5D x2 (or 10D) against a SINGLE stat in one large, nasty lump.

<snip of argument>

I hadn\'t considered second hits really, maybe as most gunfights don\'t seem
to get past the first hit for people. I concede the point. For first hits I
don\'t believe there is a real difference.

In my case Fred takes 12 points against a single stat in the first hit and
is unconsious...

Same here, one shot mods. You can use a BP once.

I\'ll go back to rolling the dice then doubling now.

   I realize that this is the `official\' history, but I have a hard time
   believing that Cortez\'s army of 200,000 angry locals played a military
   second to his 108 steel-armed Spaniards and 16 horses in the conquest
   of Mexico.  Obviously, Spanish technology made a big impression on the
   Aztec rulers and was an important motivator for the Tlaxcallan army,
   but that huge army was the driving force behind the Aztec surrender,
   not a tiny supply of steel arms and horses.

Ugh. :(  What\'s it (the "magnetic shielding") supposed to do?  In any
case, let\'s call it out.  In fact, here\'s a general rule of thumb for the
THUDDD, open for discussion:

  "Any \'canonical\' design system may be used, specifically including
   FFS1, FFS2, QSDS1.5, and SSDS.  However, no technology not specified
   in FFS2 may be used; in other words, FFS2 specifies technological
   \'canon\' with respect to the THUDDD competition, even if another system
   is used to create the design."

Reactions?

I don\'t know much about GE\'s other "man amplifiers", but the GE walking truck
did exist.  It had four legs, teleoperated by the driver\'s four limbs.  It
could climb a stack of railroad ties, and tow or flip over a jeep.

It did have some problems.  It was exhausting, physically and mentally.
Physically because of the feedback in the controls, and mentally because
controlling a four-legged walker like that is _hard_.  The operators could run
it for about 10 minutes before they were mentally exhausted.


There are two problems with man amplification: power and control.  Power\'s
solved in traveller with nifty fusion devices.  Control takes both more
engineering and more computer knowledge, for a teleoperated or amplifying
device.  For a device which can walk on its own, there\'s also the theory of
walking - basically, we don\'t know how to make something walk the way we do.
We can approximate it on, say, flat ground, but we can\'t make it react to
slipping, slopes, and other unexpected failures as we would.


Beyond 2000 has shown human-powered leg extensions (and other devices).
Basically, these extensions change the spring constant of your legs - when you
run, you bounce on your legs as though they were springs.  Changing the spring
constant can allow you to run faster by bouncing higher, giving you more time
to get your legs into position.  One year, a student made a similar device as a
project for the Legged Locomotion class we give here periodically.

Such devices will allow you to run faster, but the downsides are
(a) they\'re hard to get into and out of
(b) they\'re hard to start and stop
(c) you lose a lot of dexterity
(d) it\'s hard to deal with anything but flat terrain
(e) they break when you fall
(f) you fall further when you fall
(g) when you fall, your feet, which you use to catch yourself, are embedded in
a device which isn\'t good at catching you

In other words, because of liability and inconvenience they aren\'t commercially
viable, although they do work.


Honda has built a biped walking robot.  It looks like a man in a spacesuit,
walks on flat terrain, and can walk up a set of stairs - given knowledge of
where the stairs are and how far apart they are.  It can turn, walk forward,
walk backward, and so on as directed by an operator.  It\'s also considerably
heavier than a human being (although they claim to have built a lighter one).


The MIT Leg Lab has built externally-powered running robots (monopod, biped,
and quadruped).  They run on flat terrain, we\'re working on things which can
walk on rough terrain.  Within a year, we may have a self-contained robot which
can walk rapidly on somewhat rough terrain.



BUT the state of the art in legged locomotion, and power-assisted locomotion,
is not to the point where it can be used for the cast of Starship Troopers
(Yet).  If it were, the DOD would be using it already.


When would power-assisted devices exist in Traveller?
Reseach: this TL.
Commercial: next TL (possibly externally powered), for controlled
	circumstances.
Combat: next TL beyond that, for the computational advances necessary to
	make the suit know enough of the environment not to hamper its wearer.
	Possibly further.  Combat suits would require a small portable fusion
	plant - possibly imported from a higher TL to make it smaller.

Walking machines capable of traversing all terrain a car, or tank, can traverse
can be made at our current tech level IF there is a reason to do it.  They will
be slow, under about 10mph - faster on high-gravity worlds, slower on
low-gravity worlds (the fastest speed you can walk is a function of gravity).
If you go too fast, you become airborne and no longer have the options of
stopping and letting your slow computer figure out where to put your next foot,
or letting a human tell you where you can step.

To make them useful, they would have to be able to run, and that would take
(a) the ability to quickly analyze the terrain for footholds and obstacles.
(b) the ability to take that analyzed terrain and figure out the set of
footholds which will keep you going in the right direction, balanced, and clear
of obstacles.

Walking machines can be made now, if there\'s a reason to use them.  But to make
them "better than cars" or "as good as cars" would probably be 2 TLs down the
road.  Maybe 1 if you\'re willing to take some risks or limitations.


When would a walking machine be better than a car/tank?
. The legs of a walking machine can be completely sealed with a flexable
covering - protecting the components in a way which is impossible with wheels.
. Walking does far less damage to the environment.  The OSU hexapod walking
through a cornfield left some footprints, while a truck left a broad swath of
crushed plants.
. Large pads on feet will help prevent it from getting bogged down in sandy or
swampy environments.
. Properly designed, the legs would be able to get it to stand up again if it
fell over, even if it to land on its roof.
Then there are other considerations, like raising the cargo bay to the loading
bay\'s level, or dropping it all the way to the ground for easy load/unload.

Antigravity makes much of this moot, until you think about what a strong wind
could do to something which isn\'t being held down by gravity.  What if the
planet had near-perpetual sandstorms?  Antigrav gets blown away, and the sand
gets stuck in the wheels and tracks.  Vehicles get bogged down in dunes.  The
natives would probably develop walking cars pretty fast.


So, when would walking trucks exist in Traveller?
Commercial: this TL, IF there is a reason to want them.
	Next TL if there isn\'t.
Combat: When they can run on rough terrain (same TL as combat power-assisted 
	devices).  Again, figure out if they\'re needed - the change from wheels
	to legs is pretty drastic, and you\'re throwing away a lot of expertise
	to make it.

I love this man.  I am so excited about T4.1.

I\'ve got a good feeling that this is going to be well worth the wait,
and it will set the standard for all T4 products to come after it.

Well, the amount of resources required to stop piracy was in dispute,
as also was the method of acounting (since the percentage of your
resources it would take is irrelevant if the loses due to piracy
are even low).  However, to avoid recaping the whole thread,
the costs to patrol gas giants are relevant at every system
because you are using resources from the larger systems to
patrol the systems that don\'t have sufficient resources.

Well, dropping out the hyperbole (ie "power dive") the ships
are certainly designed to hand just that.  Sure things
can go wrong, they also can go wrong trying to land in
a built up area with traffic around.

yeah but this is also true of the seperation.  That fact is that
if you crack water you _still_ also have to seperate out the
hydrogen, so, no matter how you cut it, water involves a
seperate, energy intensive, task.

It is my understanding that you need a purifier for both water
and gas giant atmosphere.  If they don\'t require you to purify
water to use in a reactor but you do have to purify the atmosphere
of a gas giant (which is mostly hyrogen and doesn\'t contain
as many heavy element), then that just doesn\'t make sense.

Except that you aren\'t adding.  A gas giant is in range of radio

See above.

No, because, as I said, you still haven\'t established what
delays will occur waiting to get cleared to land, waiting
in line for fuel, and then getting cleared to take off.

X-TEK News Release:  279-0020

X-TEK is proud to announce the opening of it\'s latest Promenade store,
The "Gravatorium"

This shop specializes in the production of gravatic vehicles and personal 
devices, some of which have been featured in the Emperor\'s Vehicle Catalog.

Whereas the EV catalog only gave you a conservative approach, the 
Gravatorium Database contains full origional specifications for its vehicles 
and devices, for the Solomani gearhead in all of us.

All gravatorium products comply with the new FFS-2 Imperial Technical 
Architecture Manual.

Stop by the Gravatorium while you are on Planet X, or request document code:

http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/xtek/grav.htm

<END Press Release><OOC Mode on>

Ok gang!  I have decided to release the original documents, HTML-ized, to my 
website.  All were submitted to the FF&S2 beta group for the EV project.  No 
doubt what is in the book may be different to what is on my site.  Here you 
will find original, full gearheaded specs for the devices/vehicles I 
submitted.  Enjoy! :-)

What are my views of EV?  It\'s not bad.  Yes, It could have had a "TL" field 
and a more in depth descrip of the weapons, but this book appears to have 
been designed for the non-gearhead in mind.  It has just enough information 
that I can use in a game.  Most importantly it has the "SPEED!"  What else 
do you use these things for besides blowing other things up? To get 
somewhere, hopefully fast! :-)  EV fulfills my need for SPEED!

Also for the Trav newbie this is a good book to show them what imperial 
society is most likely to use to get around.  I was impressed by Sylean mass 
transit.  The Sylean Monorail does 500kph!  The interior artwork was well 
done I think, is that an X-TEK XTF-1A "Alpha-II" Fighter about to be fired 
upon in the Close Orbit Grav Fighter section?  Looks almost perfect to what 
I envisioned (Flying wing, dorsal turret laser)

It is nice to see that the designs I made are not seriously broken, the 
speeds, dimensions and basic equipment are there on the vehicle card.  Only 
error I caught was that the "Claus von Kringle Gravboard (another X-TEK 
Original!) was WAY overpriced.  I think the editor got confused as it is the 
only device under 1Kcr!  The correct price is 22.2cr, it\'s a kids toy after 
all! :-).  Also the bombers were a little vague at first, a bomber armed 
with only a gauss cannon, then I saw the "cargo" field, UHvy+.  After 
checking the tables I found that the thing could hold 20tons (thats 
20,000kg, not displacement tons) of ordinanace in its hold.  Impressive!

All in all EV is not bad.  Could stand for a little more clairity, but 
IMNSHO it\'s a good book, and very useable in any campain.

Actually, you don\'t need escape velocity, you just need to
get to orbit.  (Or a velocity where you 1G drive can make
up the difference)

I believe the difference come from QSDS weapons being designed with ROFs of
100 and SSDS weapons having a base ROF of 10.

I\'ve never seen anyone admit this for certain, but I believe that a 
"normal" weapon in QSDS has a ROF of 50 shots (per 30-minute old BL turn),
with lower ROF\'s getting worse ratings for a given energy and bonus to higher
ROFs, while in SSDS the normal ROF is assumed to be 10 shots - so the same
laser at (say) ROF10 would get a penalty in QSDS but not SSDS.

	IIRC, all QSDS weapons are built to ROF 100 while SSDS weapons may 
be ROF 50 or even ROF 10.  The higher ROF would account for the higher 
power consumption.  ROF 50 weapons should be at a -1 FC and ROF 10 weapons 
at a -2 FC.

I don\'t use the first hit rule in my game.  I like the idea behind it,
but I think it is unrealistic to use that rule for every first hit and
never again in the combat.

My Ken\'s Tweaks rule on this is to allow the T4 first hit rule (taking
all hits off of one stat) only on spectacular successes.

This keeps PC\'s alive longer, and you have the added benefit the
possibility that this can happen anytime during the combat (as opposed
to counting on it happening on the first hit).

Since SS is easier to roll the closer you are (and, thus, having a an
easier task throw), this happening in a combat is not unlikely--it just
won\'t happen the first hit all the time.

Also, this gives a benefit to rolling SS, where in T4, there is no real
benefit to rolling SS in combat.

And, as a last note, in KBv2.0, SS is tied to a character\'s skill level
(it is easier for a Level 4 skilled person to roll SS than it is for a
Level 1 person on the same exact shot).  So, the better you are, the
more likely it is that you will roll SS, the more likely it is you will
take all of your damage off of one stat.

	I don\'t think this distinction stands.  I\'m from a coastal state
and I _never_ saw a naval vessel growing up.  The only time I have since
then was when I went to visit a friend, who happened to be an Ensign at
Norfolk.  Think about all the people who don\'t even live on a coast!  How
are they supposed to _see_ where their money is going?
	For that matter, a lot of what we paid for during the Cold War was 
to station troops in places like Germany and Korea, certainly very few 
civillians ever _saw_ that defense spending.

	The level of threat certainly was higher in the Cold War US than it is 
in the Imperium, but I don\'t think the populace had any better ability to

	No, loans aren\'t any different from taxes in the final analysis 
because the loans have to be paid back with taxes.  I\'m not suggesting 
that we\'re ever going to pay back our national debt, but as much of our 
taxes goes to paying the _interest_ on that debt as currently goes to our 
entire military.  Loans are just a way to borrow against future tax income.

	How about _military_ aircraft?  Unless you go to an airshow 
you\'re unlikely to ever see military aircraft in this country.  Or 
submarines for that matter.  But people see these things all the time on 
TV and in movies.
	Atomic weapons are an even better example.  How many people in the
Western world have ever actually seen a nuclear weapon?  Very few.  And
yet everyone believes they exist and likely has opinions on whether we
should build more, dismantle the ones we have, or build SDI to defend
against them. The threat of nukes was and is totally intangible, but the
passion they inspired from activists on both sides _was_ very tangible. 
People don\'t have to be able to see a threat with their own eyes to be
persuaded to spend money to defend themselves from it. 
	I agree that 5% of GDP just for the Navy is excessive, but I 
don\'t think ground forces will take up much of the total millitary 
spending unless the world is balkanized.

Someone posted, a long time ago, in a "stupid things out PC\'s have
done and still survived" thread about a party that blew up an entire
starport that way...they just missed blowing up their own ship (they were
hauling ass out of the starship at the time) I pictured something like Air
Force One flying out of Washington in "Independence Day".

You\'re good.

The film does feature a mobile fortress that the humans do fight from
against overwhelming odds, with the battle set on the enemy\'s home planet,
which is a desert.

I\'m impressed... BTW: who\'s going to take the World Series? please respond

   Well now we finally get down to the *real* problem.  :-)

   Space Above & Beyond had people in what would be the Traveller
equivalent of combat environment suits (more or less).  They wore
helmets with clear face shields.  Everything worked very nicely.

   Ah, there\'s the rub.  S:AAB was filmed in a variety of locations,
sometimes on studio sets, sometimes outside.  I recall some of the
episodes were obviously filmed out in California\'s desert country (well
I say obvious having seen the Mojave personally), but they certainly
weren\'t the majority.

   One example I don\'t recall being mentioned to this point is Star
Wars.  There were most definately guys in plastic suits (stormtroopers)
running around in the desert (of Tatooine) in that film.

   So do a lot of night filming for God sake.  In the desert at night
you would *beg* to be put in one of those hot plastic armor suits.

   Is there no one left in Hollywood that has a Lillian Gish-like
dedication to art!?! <semi-sarcastic>

   This may end up being one of those films that you would be much
better off if you never read the book, or could somehow manage to forget
that you did.  Failing that, just pretend that those are not the
characters in the book on screen, those are guys fighting in another
sector that have similar names.  :-)

   Has there been any mention of who is doing the soundtrack for the
film?  Please let it be John Williams...

Well, as anyone who\'s been hospitalized for a while realizes, you can
survive just fine entirely in a bed for over a week.  As you mention, you
won\'t be happy, or especially clean, but you\'ll be alive.  Add in half an
hour\'s exercise per day (running around in narrow accessways, in shifts,
during the \'day\') and you\'ll do still better.

So:  Assume the classic 3.5 m deck spacing, with 3 m floor-to-ceiling
space.  We\'ll stack bunks 3-high, at 1 m intervals -- hard on
claustrophobes, but equivalent to what WW2 subs offered.

Given the maximum typical height of humans, we\'ll want beds at least 2.3 m
long.  A width of 1.5 m is about right.  To cram the most of these in per
shared access corridor, they\'ll be end-on to the corridor, so crawling in
will be like climbing into a narrow, deep cave.  0.3 m of long-axis space
is devoted to the corridor itself, which paired with the opposite set of
bunks gives a 0.6 m passage...certainly not roomy, but adequate for
getting in and out. 

If this is *really* an absolute pack-em-to-the-gills,
last-boat-before-the-nova situation, you *might* be able to get two people
per bunk in this design...but they\'d better be good friends going in, and
I wouldn\'t vouch for them staying that way by the end of the trip.

So, to summarize, I get a density of 3 people per dt, or 6 if you\'re truly
desperate.

For this I\'d guess 1 per dt is about right, or 2 at maximum.

  For even denser pack, the emergency low berths would work, though I\'m

Guys,
it really isn\'t fair to look at this as a tech 3 vs. tech 0+ military
issue. There were a number of additional factors that some historians
suggest were crucial in the defeat of the Aztecs.

1. Spanish brought with them small pox, which the locals had NO resistance. 
Think of the psychological impact that disease would have under those 
conditions.

2. Centralized government -- Take out Mexico city and you have the empire.

3. Various sociological issues that led the Aztecs to trust the Spaniards.

These factors in addition to Rob\'s point pretty much did the job for the
Spaniards.

ship using QSDS.  A TL12 2,000 ton airframe slab fitted to J2 M2 with

small staterooms except for the captain in a large.  There is enough room
for about 600 emergency low berths, or 3,600 people.

  Now, this is a very spartan design.  One would probably want more
medical personel (I included only one for the crew), a sickbay, and
perhaps some other equipment.

  On the other hand, I was thinking more emergency evacuation ship, which
accounts for the drive and manuever numbers.  A J1 M1 ship would be even
cheaper and hold more - about 4,100 in emergency low berths, just
eyeballing it (I didn\'t run the numbers, so I may be off by a few
hundred).

  This packs folks in at 1 per 0.5 tons - pretty much the limit, I think.

So how about telling us how many and what size ships you think would be

It is my belief that losses due to piracy and brigandage is acceptable to an
orderly society only if they have no choice about the matter (ie. that in
order to deal with it effectively it has to cut down on something else that
it considers important). So if the Imperium does, indeed, have the assets to

Right. Let\'s move on with the thread instead. How about you tell me how
you think a pirate would operate and how he actually catches his prey 
and avoid being hunted down by the navy.

Then you understand wrong. Any ship can get unrefined fuel by wilderness
refuelling. What you can\'t do without a fuel purifier plant for is to
refine the fuel.

You take water, run electricity through it, and collect the hydrogen. That
is your fuel. Apparently hydrogen gotten this way contains impurities. Or
you collect hydrogen from a Gas Giant. Such hydrogen is also impure. Running
the hydrogen through a fuel purifier plant apparently gets you refined fuel.

Wait a minute. I thought we had disposed of the side trip to a Gas Giant
when you want to go to the main world of the same system and was down to
those ships that is just passing through on their way to the next system.
If you\'re back to visiting both the main world and a Gas Giant then you
are back to wasting days instead of hours.

	I would rather think that european military tradition was
	something the Aztecs did\'nt think about. Their tradition was
	not to conquer and kill, but more like an anual sports event,
	where young man meet on a field between two cities to fight.
	Goal was not to kill the oponent, or of conquer land, but only
	to show own warriorship and to "invite" one or two of the other
	side for the next celebration. This tradition showed the same
	consequence (femicide) to population control as normal european
	war does.

	So the success was more based on the suprise of the a new tactic
	"conquer and kill" than on real military advantages. The Zulus
	on the other hand where better prepared so the managed to withstand
	english machine guns much longer. Shakas "Imperium" was also based
	on "rape/murder/slavery" so he knowed how to fight a war.

	But as you can "stack" more jump-units on a higher techlevel
	you can improve fuel efficency by the same formular as TNE
	used. And you stack them 2,3,4,5,6,7 for jump 1-6, so you have

	(a jump 1 drive for a tl12 scout should be 1.66 and not 2dt)
	as HPG banks improve over the time. This smaller drived would

	to alow that only 6.6dt fuel per parsec will be used when MT/TNE
	jump drives are asumed.

	Just multiply life support system is to easy. I asumed that
	2/3 of the life support is static while the rest is replaceable.
	So a double size life support gives you 4 weeks and a 4 times

Thanks for a very interesting post, Simon. I\'m going to take it home and
study it in depth. In the meantime, here are a few points I noticed right
away:

>If we compare the shipyard capacity of 1935 Britain (2,000,000 tons -

Remember that the TCS figure for shipyard capacity is what is available
for naval construction over and above replacements and maintenance and
that it dosen\'t include civilian construction at all. If the calculations
I\'ve just posted about the Spinward Marches are representative, then
naval shipyard capacity is actually more than twice the 14 m3 and still
dosen\'t say anything about civilian shipyards. 

>Let us make another comparison, if shipyards build 4,000,000 m3 per

That all depends on just what you are building. If you are actually
building Tigresses then each ship takes 4 and a half year to build,
cutting down your production drastically. In fact, in order to have
a ship finished in a year you have to restrict yourself to Gazelles.

>Mind you, 4 BatRons would cost 1.1 Trillion credits per year to maintain 
>(eqivalent to the Naval tax on 2.3 billion people).

Tigresses are fairly expensive per T. The same amount of _Ghalalk_ class
Armored Cruisers would only cost 77% of that. (50,000 Gazelles would be
32% _more_ expensive, though).

Only if you are willing to go through the initiation. ;->

"Damage to the primary target is doubled, after any subtraction for armor
and/or cover, and the maximum damage is doubled as well.  For example, a
damage rating of 3D versus a rigid armor rating of 1 would result in 4D to
the target -- 3 minus 1 is 2; 2 doubled is 4.  Targets adjacent to the
primary target take normal damage if hit.", p 56

Guys, my reading of the rule agrees with Dom. From the example, it looks
like the *number* of dice are doubled (not their value) and the number of
damage dice (the 3D blowthrough rule) is doubled as well.  I had missed
this until I reread the rules.  This seems to mean that a 5D Snub Pistol
would do double damage after subracting armor/cover and would produce up to
6D worth of damage to a primary target.

Example:  5D versus rigid armor of 1

 5D-1 = 4Dx2 = 8 (1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5), but only *6* dice are applied as
               damage (5,5,4,4,3,3)
               
Damage like that will put almost *any* character down quite fast!

Nick,

The CSC mag shield is only good against kenetic rounds, and plasmas. Lasers
are not affected by it. Net result nothing in starship combats using
lasers, and nuke lasers.

Lessee... jump drives costs MCr4.2 per displacement T. Buying them from a
TL 12 world with TL 15 credits (in both cases worlds with a Class A
starport) is 15% cheaper. A saving of Cr630,000 per dT. Transportation
costs are Cr1000 per parsec (actually quite a bit less, but let\'s not
get into that). So if there is a suitable world within the sector you
can save about Cr600,000 per dT. For a 400 T patrol cruiser that is a
saving of MCr 9.6. I don\'t know what such a ship costs in T4, but in MT
it costs MCr164, which would make it a saving of about 6%.

I did some calculations once that seemed to make the Imperium use (30% 
of) Cr170 per citizen, but that was based on quite a few unsupported
assumptions. I don\'t recall seeing any official statements about
Imperial spending.

	Note that the 14m3 for a "standard" bunk includes more than actually just
the bunk; otherwise it would be ridiculously large. It also includes the
actual access space around the bunk, as well as the ventilation, plumbing,
etc. portions of life support, and lighting, and etc., and etc. and a tiny
smidgeon o\'common space, which really only comes into play when you\'ve got
a bunch of bunks. Most things in FF&S2 actually contain more than what
they\'re labelled (so you don\'t have to worry about the specific details of
interior partitions, doors, iris valve mechanisms, glove box lights, etc.,
etc.)

	Yet another item we ran out of time for inclusion in FF&S2 was different
levels of crowding (so you could design a spacious luxury liner, or a
sardine-can tramp).

Well at this point you\'re just being contrary for the sake of being contrary.
 You\'ve made up your mind that its an abomination (don\'t get me wrong, you
may be right).

At any rate, I just reported the news as I heard it when it was being filmed.
 To be honest, I don\'t really care too much about the whole deal.  I liked
the book, chances are I\'ll like the movie for completely different reasons,
and most of my friends will bitch about it afterwards.

The world is big enough to contain both (the Director also did "Total
Recall", and I liked that movie, so I\'ll at the very least give it a chance).

    'body' => 'So I have a little spare time on hand, and decide to play with my brand
spankin\' new copy of FF&S II.  And, inspired by my recent purchase of
Journal #4, in which the Gazelle Close Escort originally appeared, I
figure, "How \'bout one of them thar\' particle accelerator barbettes?"

The problem is, of course, that I\'ve been away GURPSing for so long and
the Traveller starship rules have been in such a state of flux, that I
don\'t know what the reasonable values are for starship components (a
condition which also hampers my willingness to leap into THUDDD again).

Yes, I recall that FF&S II had to be left deliberately vague since no
starship combat system worth spitting over existed/exists.  But do we
really only have the logarithmic scales from Table 126 (Planetary and Far
Orbit look like the only two usual possibilities for most space battles?),
or should we be planning for weapon uses in a hex-delimited system a la
what I recall of Brilliant Lances (with hexes how big? 50,000 km?)?  How
large a damage value is "reasonable" from FF&S-II-designed weapons?

For what it\'s worth, I include my current take on a TL14 NPAWS barbette
intended for mounting in pairs on Gazelle-class ships.  I\'ve changed it
from the CT five tons to the more recently "canonical" six, and, no, I
haven\'t yet designed the ship around it -- thought I\'d see if this works
first.  I welcome comments showing errors in my understanding of the
design sequence or the "scale" of space combat: I honestly have no idea if
it\'s a terror of the spaceways or a laughable hatpin launcher.  And I
apologize that it\'s too small to even merit a mention in the Famille
Spofulam Kids\' Catalog.... :-)

This doesn\'t make sense to me.  It seem like thrust needs to go in
different directions to allow for maneuvering.  The DGP rule of 25% to
the sides and 10% reverse seemed about right.

If thrust for thruster plates in T4 is only provided in one direction,
then how is orienation and maneuvers performed?  Certainly not with
orientation jet-thrusters?

Let\'s say a ship is bee-bopping the 4 hours or so down to a jump point. 
There is another ship in range of the sensors.

How does a ship find another using sensor in the first place if the
sensor operator is not actively doing a sensor sweep?

Do ships automatically leave passive sensors on all the time?

If so, how does a ref handle this in a game--not wanting to tip off the
players if the sensor sweep roll fails?  Should I roll the sensor tech\'s
task throw behind my screen without letting the players know what I\'m

What\'s the best way to handle this?

(the following was copied from a post I sent to my players)

Emperor\'s Vehicles

I looked at this tonight, and it looks to be pretty good.  Although I
didn\'t buy it yet, I\'m planning on getting it.

I\'d heard some bad things (and some good things) about it on the TML,
and I wanted to check it out first.  I was pleasantly surprised with
what I found.

One thing that I didn\'t like about the book was that I had heard on the
TML that TL\'s were not included for the vehicles.  I\'m disappointed to
find out that this is true.  But, I can easily assign TL\'s to the
vehicles as we use them.

The whole book is nothing but a huge number of vehicles--I\'m talking
about eight vehicles per two pages!  Each two-page spread includes some
good art work of a selected vehicle (not that crappy stuff that was in
the main book) and a discussion of that particular vehicle group.

Then, the opposite page from this picture and description is eight
vehicle examples, complete with stats.  Like I said, the only thing
missing seems to be the TL.

Just the sheer number of vehicles in the book makes it worth the money,
but I like the added extra--extended game rules for using vehicles.  In
the back of the book, there are rules for handling vehicles and
operating them.

It looks like a decent supplement, and the breath of vehicles it covers
is amazing--from animal mounts to orbital vehicles.

(the following is copied from my player e-mail)



Just to keep you up to date, here is a list of all of the current
supplements now out for T4.


Book 1:  Main Rule Book.
A revision of this, written by Marc Miller himself, is coming out soon. 
It\'s been pushed back to December from what I\'ve heard.  From what I\'ve
seen from the small sections that Marc has put on the TML, it\'s going to
be well worth the wait.  

We need a main rule book that is more detailed than the basic book we
now have.  This new book looks like it is going to fill that need
perfectly.  I\'m excited about it.



Book 2:  Starships
Includes several starships, stats, and deckplans.  One half of the book
is devoted to the SSDS, the Standard Starship Design System for creating
your own starships.

I\'ve got it.



Book 3:  Central Supply Catalog
Just about every piece of equipment ever published for Traveller is in
this book.  There\'s new rules mixed within for different pieces of
equipment that is really neat.  About half of this book is a vehicle
design system for designing your own vehicles, and from what I\'ve seen
of it, it looks like a good system.  There\'s also a quick and dirty
robot design system included.  And,there\'s some good commentary of being
a merchant in Imperial space.

I\'ve got it.  All players should have a copy of this book.



Book 4:  Aliens Archive
This book introduces 12 new aliens to the Traveller universe.  We
haven\'t used this book much yet, but we will as we deal with these
particular aliens.  Game rules for running these aliens as PCs are
included.

I\'ve got it.



Book 5:  Milieu 0
This book is a campaign sourcebook for those running games set in the
year 0.  Since our game is set in the 1100\'s, we have little need for
this and I haven\'t cracked it much.  But, from what I\'ve seen of it, I
might transplant some of the ideas in it into our campaign.  There\'s a
map of the Core sector included.

I\'ve got it.



Book 6:  First Survey
This book contains maps and world information on the Core sector and the
eight sectors around it.  The world UWPs are set for the M0 campaign
background, and I haven\'t found this book that useful for our game.  It
is useful, though, to have this info and maps for sectors that I don\'t
have.

I\'ve got it.



Book 7:  Emperor\'s Arsenal
This incredible book contains tons of weapons for the game, sorted by
TL.  There\'s also tons of game rules interspersed therein.  It\'s a must
have.

I\'ve got it, and so should you.  I\'d like every player to have a copy.



Book 8:  Pocket Empires
This book gives you game rules for running your own planet or even small
empire outside the Imperium.  I\'ve got plans for this book...and your
characters are really going to move up the ladder as our campaing moves
on.  This book also includes two new chargen systems for two new T4
character types--Diplomats and Bureaucrats.

I\'ve got it.



Book 9:  Anomalies
This is a book of small adventures, many of which are related in
campaign fashion.  We\'re going to be playing some of these sooner than
you think.

I\'ve got it.



Book A:  Psionic Institutes
This book covers training institutes for psionics in the year 0.  With a
little coversion, I\'m going to use some of this info in our game when we
introduce psionics--again sooner than you think.  This book also
contains several psionic related adventures.



Book B:  Fire Fusion and Steel
This book contains design systems for designing your own starships and
weapons.

I\'ve got it.



Book C:  Emperor\'s Vehicles
I don\'t have this one yet, but it contains several game ready vehicles,
from animal mounts to orbital vehicles, complete with stats.

I will get it.



Adventures:

The Long Way Home
It\'s an adventure set in the year 0, which I\'m going to transplant into
our game.  This is a long, campaign style adventure like the one we are
currently playing, The Traveller Adventure.

I\'ve got it.



Gateway
This is part two of adventure started in The Long Way Home.  I don\'t
have it yet, but I\'ll get it when it comes time.



Magazines:

Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society #25
This magazine picks up where it left off back in the early 80\'s.  During
the CT edition of this game, this magazine came out quarterly,
containing all types of fan inspired info for gaming in the Traveller
universe.  The last issue was number 24.  This magazine picks up with
issue number 25 for the T4 game.

I\'ve got it.



Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society #26
This is the second issue of the T4 version of this gaming magazine. 
Issue #27 is due out soon.

I\'ve got it.



Miscellaneous:

T4 Gamemaster\'s Screen
I hide behind this screen during every game.  I find it useful,
especially have the reaction table right in front of me.  I also like to
hide my die throws.  It comes with a short adventure written by Marc
Miller that we will be playing.

I\'ve got it.

Yes TV, and don\'t forget the films.

Truth be told, film, television and other media have a massive impact and
influence on people.  Sorry if you disagree, but its completely true.  Ask
the average American where the Fulda gap is and they will not know.  Truth be
told.  To be honest, I don\'t know where the Fulda gap is.

The brutality of the Soviet regime?  How much of this was colored by American
media and press, television, media and film.  And how much American brutality
was in fact thinly covered up so we could sleep well at night.

Don\'t get me wrong here.  I\'m not going to say that the soviets didn\'t cover
up brutality.  And I\'m not trying to say that the Soviet regime was
absolutely right or correct.  Truth be told, your average American citizen
got more fired up by Ivan Drago in Rocky IV then tanks in the Fulda gap.
 Sorry.

If you honestly believe that such films didn\'t influence Joe Beercan out
there then I am truly astonished.  I as an American have surprisingly little
faith in the American public and their ability to make decisions.  That\'s
something that you have to put up with however, the good and the bad.

Oh, and I forgot the influence of the great WWF villain Nikolai Volkov.

Truth be told, I can\'t figure out why you took such as massive amount of
offense to that statement.

Hans, this is one of the most useful posts I have seen lately. I would like
to see how you determined cost for passage. It\'s not that I don\'t trust
your numbers, I just wanted to know what you base your calculations on.
Also, what is "steerage"? If it is safer than a 17% chance if instant death
no one would ever use low passage.

In my campaign a middle passenger gets a full stateroom (otherwise there is
no way a high passenger would ever bump one, and anyway even a full
stateroom is pretty small). I assume "economy" passage is a small stateroom.

I agree.  This is definitely a GOOD THING.

Yes, I know that.  I was letting you know that he didn\'t know either.

Just like Stalone in "Judge Dredd".  Those familiar with the comic book
knew that Dredd was like Wilson on Home Improvement-- nobody ever saw his
face.  But put an actor with a salary of $20 million in the role and the
producers wanna be damned sure that s/he gets maximum visibility.

IIRC, Heinlein\'s wife fought the studio to remove her husband\'s name from
the motion picture, based on what she saw of some early footage.
Originally launched as "Robert A. Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers", it is now
being billed simply as "Starship Troopers".  So the link to Heinlein is
out, AFAIK.

Well, damn, Eris!  I think you are right!

So, for most KE autofire weapons, the maximum damage it can inflict on a
character is 6D.

But I disagree with you here.  Your example is right until you get to
the first set of 8D rolled.  I read the rule like this:

    5D-1 = 4Dx2 = 8

    BUT Max damage rule states a max of 6D can be applied to a character
from      autofire.

    Given this, 8 dice are never thrown, because you can only throw 6
maximum.  Taking     the first six values from your example above,
damage would be (1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4)     total.

We have been over this.  I told you how many ships I thought

of ships that were appropriate, and I responded to how your

Well, I don\'t agree, we already tolerate crimes in the US because
the cost of eliminating them is too high.  Further more, the Imperium
is, to me at least, not the concerned with the individual.  One
could have a different view, but that would their own take on the
issue, not a point that invalidates other takes.  I feel that
any idea that the Imperium will do what it would take,
regarless of cost, to start piracy is not a sufficent basis.

We already covered pirates operating out of bases vs pirates

Exactly what I meant, you need a purifier for both kinds of fuel.
But it is the same cost and speed to purify water and gas giant
atmosphere.  But water requires more steps than purification
of gas giant atmospheres.

Right so water involves the extra step.  You have to split it, and then
purify it.  Gas Giant atmophere only requires purification.

No, that was something else you weren\'t considering.  There was also
interplanetary travel as a third source.

Right, and if you radio ahead, they can well not be wasted.

OK, I see what you are trying to do - and generally I\'d say you\'re doing
it well.  Be warned, however, that saying something misleading can lead
to problems later.  In this case, I might rephrase it something like:

  A reactionless drive means that there is no reaction that takes place
  place to produce thrust.  Rockets are a good example of reaction
  drives.

This way, even if they associate reaction with burning fuel and make a
mistake as a result, they can\'t blame you for it...

Seems fair.

Agreed.

I think that\'s pushing the cg lifters\' abilities too far.

It depends. 8-)  In a cinematic game, I\'d let the engineer roll to
"push" the lifters, then if the roll was close I\'d give the pilot a roll
to save the day.  In a more realistic campaign, I\'d say they\'re stuck
planetside.  As to what they can do about this - I don\'t know!  They\'d
probably have to attach Very Expensive boosters to the ship to get it up
again.

I think you are looking at this the wrong way. People have an average
mass of less than 100kg.  Most people have an average density slightly
less than that of water (which is why most people float).  Therefore you
should be able to get 10 people per cubic meter if you reduce them to
corpses and do not worry about breaking bones when you stack them.  At
14 cubic meters to a displacement ton you should be able to get 140
corpses per displacement ton. At an average mass of 60 kg (including
children) you could get over 200 corpse per displacement ton. (Ghouls
take note - people are mostly water & water contains hydrogen -
therefore passengers can be broken down to provide a small ammount of
fuel.)

The only question we have to answer is how much more loosly do we have
to pack them to let them live.  We might be able to find reasonable 
first guesses by looking at the shipping records of slave ships bringing
african slaves to the new world in the early 19th century.  However at
higher tech levels we should be able to pack people even more densly
than the slave ships did.

Under zero gravity conditions, with forced air jets for ventilation, no
food or hygeine, and water provided by gravitically controlled water
jet  into the mouth I think that slaves or prisoners could probably be
packed so they took up most of the space in the hull.  The use of
psychotropic drugs to ensure docility will aid in this effort.

Therefore I think you might be able to pack in 100 people per ton if you
had to in a specially designed slave ship.  Remember that by increasing
your slave load you can afford a higher rate of losses and still make
money on the trip, this was called dense packing by slave ship captains.
Casualties can be thrown overboard.

Obligatory disclamer:  I am not in favor of slavery & I hope that the
unpleasant realites of history I have discussed do not offend anyone.

You may have a drive that uses less fuel for a trip of the same duration
but all this means is that jump drives capable of longer jumps are more
fuel efficent than drives that are only capable of short jumps.

Look in the rules and you will see quite clearly that jump drives do
_not_ improve in volume, mass, price (except vis a vis exchange rates),
or fuel usage between TL\'s 9 and 16.  This is canon.  The reason I
choose to use to explain why this is so is that between TL\'s 9 and 16
there is no theoretical understanding of why jump drives operate as they
do.  (More evidence that they are crude interface devices for
Yaskodray\'s TL 30 or so marvel of jump space - but that is another
discussion.)

The MT rules include the stats for the TL 15 version of the jump 1 fat
trader.  If TL 15 worlds are building them I bet TL 16 worlds are too. 
Therefore we _know_ that they are being produced - it is our job to
figure out why.

Maybe it should be - but under canon it is not possible.

Also, immediately after that, there\'s an example using a Type S (Scout

not even an option on the talble.

Question #2:  Which is wrong, the range factor quoted in the example or

Which, carried to logical conclusion, means that there is no *real* reason why a
ship needs to be AF or SL to land on a world with an atmosphere! Whoops, that\'s
almost as hot a topic as .1C Rocks as weapons. Be warned. Have the asbestos

Well, do they? Why assume a high speed takeoff in (2) and (3). Assume that the
captain takes it up at a whopping 20 miles per hour (even Model T Fords could do
that, and they were definitely USL) ... he can make a high enough altitude to
forget about wind resistance in, what, half an hour or so? So who needs AF and
SL Hullforms *unless* you have a need for speed ... the military and
high-priority civilian craft. A fat, happy, Trader on a well established route
needs no such ability.

Well, that\'s the way your argument *can* lead ... remember what I said about the
0.1C Rock? Maybe you\'ll wish you\'ve been hit by one when all this dies down!

What about a Japanese style "Coffin Hotel" ... they can be quite comfortable
inside one ... TV, Phone, Computer etc. all built in. Individual enviro controls
for heating/cooling. Of course, sanitary and eating facilities are usually
elsewhere. And, of course, the Japanese are more culturally able to handle
overcrowding than us westerners (or so I\'ve always been told/read ... I\'m

I think that you\'d get around 6 of these Coffin cubicles to a dt -- but allowing
for rec/messing areas would mean that this would be effectively reduced. Perhaps
to the 3 per dt you suggest overall.

It\'s not the *gravity* that counts. It\'s the escape velocity. And
Jupiter has a *hellacious* escape velocity. Something like 200 km/sec.

Nope. An atlatl is the same as a woomera. They are both what is
generically termed "spear throwers". Basicly a long stick with a sort
of "hook" on one end and a groove to hold a spear. The hook fits into a
hollow at the base of the spear. The spear is pointing towards the end
that *doesn\'t* have a hook. You hold the hookless end and when you
swing your arm properly, the atlatl acts like an extension of your arm,
letting you throw the spear faster, harder, and farther.

I can\'t help with cost, but I can with size.

They have to be at least as big as the equivalent airport. So the
primitive frontier type is just a cleared hunk of bedrock. And the big
class A ports could be *miles* across.

One consideration for the *minimum* size is that ships are likely to be
*noisy*. At least some ships are going to be using reaction drives. And
being more efficient doesn\'t lessen the noise.

And even ships using thruster plates are going to be generating sonic
booms on take off or landing.

Next, you\'ll need ruunaways for the ships that do horizontal takeoffs
or landings. And for the ships that takeoff or land verticall, you\'ll
need landing areas (berths?) that are a fair ways apart so that if
someone screws up, he\'s not likely to crash into the ship at the next
berth.

Ok, you can cram a human onto a padded shelf (it doesn\'t deserve the
name "bunk") 2m long, 1m wide, and .5m tall. Assuming 2.5 meters floor
to ceiling, that gives you 5 layers. One DT is 14m^3. So 3 meters tall,
by 2 meters long, leaves 2 1/3rd meters of width. That means two sets
of bunks, with a 1/3rd meter passage between them. You can make the
passage wider and the bunks a bit narrower.

Anyway, this gives you 10 adults per DT. For a one week trip, the
passengers don\'t need food. Water can either be sipping tubes at
bunks, or drinking fountains in a common area (which also has the
toilets). 

Assuming that you have time to prepare folks before hauling them, you
could "clean them out" (with an enema) and then just supply water to
the bunks, and pipe away urine. This even lets you get rid of the
toilets (which otherwise eat into the space for bunks), and if you want
to get *really* extreme you eliminate the walkway. Narrow the bunks a
bit more and you get *15* people per DT. You\'d have to load a "column"
of bunks, then shove in a new column to fill.

But if you *really* want to pack in people, check into the way the did
it on the ships that carried slaves from Africa. They packed them
"spoon fashion". That is, they had them lie on their side, and then
packed them in with the back of one person against the chest of the
previous one. I get around *30* people per DT for this. Maybe 40, if
you can get 4 layers in 3 meters.

You can clean them out first, or just do like the slavers did, and hose
out the decks every so often. I\'m not sure if you\'d get an acceptable
survival rate with no water for the whole week, though "super
hydrating" them first might help. And sedating them is just about
mandatory. 

This last option is obviously only viable for dire emergencies or slavers.

Duh! I just realized that "fast" drug or the like could solve the
problem neatly.

I think we are talking about different things. As Heinlein noted, the
suit should be providing proper feedback, and (once learned) your *own*
reflexes should handle things. Otherwise it\'s useless. You *have* to be
able to move without thinking about it. That means reflexes. 

The truck has problems because it has the user trying to be a
quadruped, with equal length front and back legs. Humans are lousy
quadrupeds, and our limbs aren\'t the same length. So the feedback
doesn\'t really match the operator.

Well, several places have "robots" that can walk on almost any terrain.
They are six legged, and are controlled by some incredibly *simple*
neural nets. They cheated, of course. The nets are copied from ants.
But they work.

Well, six-legged is actually a lot more stable than four-legged, so I
suspect that the insect neural nets, with perhaps some tweaking, will
do nicely.

Don\'t forget that the object still has all of its normal inertia. So
while the wind will move it, it is trying to move a *heavy* object.
Think of a big weight on smooth ice. The wind will move it, but slowly.

Look at the (Keith?) painting of an aproaching SDB on one of the large
format Traveller Digests - it clearly has attitude thruster ports on the
nose edges.

I for one say something along the lines of "...T-plates can produce thrust
in all directions but with different efficiency and as most ships have 3 or
more T-plates any change of orientation can be made. The same goes with
gravthrusters as the mostly wingless gravvehicle designs would look kind of
silly if they\'d have to brake by running with their hindquarters first.

Instead of rolling tasks based on effective signature (sensitivity + sig -
range). Roll a task every hour or so and if spectacular failure -1 on
effective signature, failure +-0, success +1 on signature and spectacular
sucess +2. Then use effective sig below 0 = not detected 1=indication (sig
and position but not vector), 2=sig, pos and vector and 3+ sig, pos, vector
and what type of tharget there is.

If the computer (being that dumb submoronic sensor op it is) is sweeping
use the sigs as they are (ie the same as when a sensor op fails his task).
Referee could also say that spectacular fails/sucesses must reroll every
gameturn while others may roll every shift, halfshift or whatever. A
similar ruling works very well for me. This rule also makes nice effects as
the PCs are playing poker in the common room when the computer blares
"Unidentified target detected 30 kiloclicks off the port bow". Gunners rush

THEY ARE...not Aztecs. The Mexica did not trust the Spaniards and spent a
greatd eal of effort to try and convince them to go away. The severely
oppressed coastal cities hated the Mexica, and saw the Spanish as a way to
freedom from the excessive tribute required. 

>These factors in addition to Rob\'s point pretty much did the job for the
Spaniards.
The Tlaxcallans were on a steady but slow retreat (ie they were losing to
the Mexica). It came down a lot to morale, the foolishness (ie superstition)
of Moctezuma II and a lot of intelligence on the part of Cortes. But give
the man his due. To just slough this off and say it was all luck is to be a
bit foolish, n\'est pas? The Mexica did nothing, all their wonderful stuff
(with the exception of some very clever stuff early on involving agriculture
(the chinampas), they took all their ideas, calendars and such from the only
real innovators in the region, the Toltecs (who were extinct by this point)

Now, back to Traveller.....
The Spaniards kicking the crap out of the numerically and socially (sort of)
superior Mexica and then using the disaffected client states as a base to
strike at their centre sounds very similiar to the interstellar wars (not
the start, just the way of the war later)

How much money was pumped into troops stationed in Korea and Germany vs.
total spending?  Was it nearly as much as nukes alone?  I would think not.
 What that means is the troops in Korea and Germany weren\'t a major siphon,
so people didn\'t notice them.  However, as I said in another statement the
cold war was a war.  People will put up with more when a state of war is in
effect.

I think they would have a better ability to see their navy in the U.S.  How
many military ships in Traveller are streamlined at all?  How many can land
on the surface of a planet?

I\'m going to stay out of this part of the discussion until I finish reading
the books on macroeconomics I got out from the library.  As far as I can
tell, however, loans are different than taxes in figuring GNP.

But people _do_ have to see a threat with their own eyes and _feel_ it with
their own hands to really perceive it as a threat and to pay 1/20th of their
yearly income to defend against it IN ADDITION to their own world\'s military
spending, and their own world\'s government spending and local community
taxes.

Somewhat pointed out that the Reagan era military spending was 7.5% of the
GNP.  This may have been true.  On the other hand, education was cut, aid
programs were cut and road programs were cut to do this and all worked at
decreased efficiency while the Reagan era military spending was up.

There are actual figures in Path of Tears (TNE supplement) that says on a
balkanized world, 1% of the world is in military service and on
non-balkanized worlds 0.1% of the population is.  Ground forces will be kept
"just in case" in my opinion.  I would think a world would feel naked without
its own local military.

If this is true there really should be some comments on it in the THUDDD
as this is really going to effect the battle worthiness of the SSDS ships.

But this should have effect on the damage values, since you do not role
hits for each shot, but once for all shots in one turn together. The SSDS
weapons seems to me to be much more capable than the QSDS weaponry.

Here\'s how:

1. Combat rounds are only 2 seconds long.

2. Everything happens at once, subject to common sense.

Common sense says that if I try to swing an axe at someone who\'s got a
pistol aimed at me., I\'m in trouble. If he\'s got to draw or cock the
pistol, HE\'s in trouble. If someone specifically wants to beat another
character to the draw/shot, he can make an extra skill test at whatever
level I choose to impose to do it - I modify the difficulty according to
how silly the suggestion is. The other thing I try very hard to impose is
confusion - unless a character can see a particular baddie, he gets no
information - thus characters often get a funny idea about how many and
where the bad guys are. I could tell you how two yokels with single-barrel
shotguns kept the characters pinned for over an hour, convinced they\'d run
into a whole platoon of snipers, by shooting and moving (at long range -
their weapons were totally useless at that range, but only I knew that.) By
the time the characters had figured out what was going on, the yokels were
long gone!

Let me tell you about a firefight we had:

The characters were trying to help out a low-tech farmsteader fight off a
horde of pony nomads. The setting was TNE, and the characters were armed
with non-military weapons (revolvers, shotguns and ONE assault rifle).
Locals were using percussion-cap revolvers and carbines, plus not a few
flintlocks 
and melee weapons.

Beans\' character (I REALLY don\'t know Beansy\'s real name!) ran around the
side of the farmhouse as the frontal defence caved in. Some nomads had
crossed the courtyard under fire and were shooting into the farmhouse
kitchen at the trapped local family. Beans had four rounds left in his
revolver. Nomad One turned from the window, thumbcocking his single-action
revolver. Beans got a shot off \'free\' while he was turning  - missed -
then both fired at once. Two misses. Behind nomad One, Nomad Two (with his
back to the fight and not knowing what was happening) scrambled through the
window and shot one of the defenders (who was firing out of another window)
dead. 

Beans\' target dived aside while cocking his weapon, making Beans miss. The
nomad then decided to beat Beans to the shot. I gave him the roll, made it,
and got a shot off before Beans could act.

Unfortunately, I missed due to the penalty for rushing the shot. Beans
didn\'t.

Forgetting that his weapon was now empty, Beans piled into the farmhouse,
hell-bent on rescue. The nomad inside had also emptied  his weapon - into
the backs of the defenders, who\'d failed to notice him in all the chaos of
a firefight. Beans shot the nomad down, or would have but for his empty
gun....

Ref: \'Click. You\'re empty. Try to keep track, huh?\'
Beans: \'Oh deary me!\' (or something like that)
Ref: (rolls for nomad - does he know his weapon is empty?) \'He thumbcocks
his pistol, shoves it out at your face and pulls the trigger. You see the
hammer start to fall....\'
Beans: \'Aaargh! Can I duck?\'
Ref: \'Truly staggeringly awesomely difficult Agility check?"
Beans: \'Guess what? I failed.\'
Ref: \'Ah well... Click!\'
Beans: \'Remind me to kill you sometime.\'
Ref: \'He drops the pistol, dragging his fighting-hatchet from his belt.\'
Beans: \'I\'ll reverse my pistol and club him!\'
Ref: \'He\'s got to draw it.... does he beat you?\'
(both make weapon skill tasks based upon Agility (Dex) - the Nomads is
hard, Beans\' is normal - his weapon is already to hand. 
Unsurprisingly, Beans is successful and the nomad is not.
Beans: \'Ha!\' (Thud) \'Hey, these make pretty good clubs....\'

One nomad down. Beans reloads. Another nomad hurtles through the door,
waving a hatchet.

Beans: \'Ha! This time I\'m loaded.\'
Ref:\'He\'s going to try to beat you.\'
Beans: \'Over five feet? While I have a weapon drawn?\'
Ref: \'Yup. Didn\'t say he had any chance.... (Rolls dice) err, Beans, can
you make a normal skill roll?\'
Beans: \'Did it\'
Ref: \'The nomad\'s entrance caught you slightly off-balance. During that
split second of hesitation, he lunges forward, swinging.... you shoot
simultaneously with his swing.\'

In this case, both managed to hit one another quite severely. Beans then
emptied his pistol into the nomad, on the assumption that anyone that lucky
shouldn\'t be suffered to live.

The way this system works is this: A 2-second round allows a single blow,
shot or
burst. All shots are dealt with, then all blows, unless there are special
considerations
like drawing the weapon, turning, crossing ground or whatever. Anyone can
declare that they are going to try to beat their opponent to the shot. They
immediately make an extra skill check at whatever difficulty level seems
appropriate, against a check by their opponent at normal difficulty
(modified if the opponent wants to speed up HIS shot). It is quite possible

for several people to shoot one another more or less simultaneously.

The idea is to make combat more fluid. This method requires strict GM
control and common sense, such that it is practically impossible for the
three guys who have wandered around the corner with their rifles slung to
outdraw the hero waiting for them with his huge axe at the ready. 

People DO hesitate, though, and this system allows some chance for that to
happen. It makes combat less of a sure thing unless you stack the odds by
maneuver or good tactics (not Tactics skill). Otherwise, you get that
authentic 
Reservior Dogs feeling (I can shoot, but I\'ll probably die).

Anything that makes combat more anarchic is all right with me.

>are the CORE members that wrote the program on this list?
Yes. I wrote it. I\'ve been here fore years, just a little more quiet
recently. What? You claim my software has bugs? Lets step outside...

But, seriously. Let me explain a little about how TravSuite came to be and
its current disposition.
If you put your mind back to Euro/GenCon last year. T4 was just out. Also
just out was the D&D CD-ROM. I have been writing gaming support software
for years (Library/Sysgen was the most noted in the Traveller field) but
had always bogged down before getting anything as encompassing as the D&D
Suite. When I realised when reviewing it was that they had gone for
simplicity. They had just implemented the 80% of features that 90% of
people use instead of the nifty, but seldom used, others.
With that revelation I could see that it could be quite easy for a similar
Traveller Suite to be done. To articulate this view I put together a
"Concept Prototype". A bunch of modules I either whipped up quickly or had
lying around from previous projects and bundled them together into a
demonstrable product. (You can still upload this from the web.)
At EuroGenCon I demonstrated this to Ken Whitman and a number of game
distributors. They were all reasonably keen on the subject. I was keen on
seeing it done, but I wasn\'t that keen on doing the work. Why? Well, it is
simple. I\'m a software professional. I do it for work. Mixing your work and
hobby removes the fun from both. Secondly is the time factor. If I was to
spend the time to do a good job of it I\'d either have no free time of my
own, or else it wouldn\'t get released till 1998. In my real job I\'m the
technical lead on a team that produces tools used internally for testing
Lotus products. Consequently I know, intimately, the effort and care
required to produce quality software. I was not willing to spend that much
of my free time on it.
First they asked me what I thought of Campaign Cartographer. For those of
you not familiar with this, it is mapping software for doing flat-maps
(landscape, cities, dungeons) largely aimed at D&D. I said that I had
uploaded their demo. It was poor. It ran in DOS, was written in _assembler_
(which says to me "old and unmaintainable"), only supported 16 colours,
limited printers, had a non-intuitive (i.e. non-Windows) interface and was
generally a bitch to use. Quite expensive as well.
Then they asked me how I thought it did. I replied that it must be making
money hand over fist. They kept releasing new modules for high prices, they
had several pages worth of advertising in Dragon magazine each month, and
that doesn\'t come cheap.
So, they concluded, you don\'t need quality to sell well.
Sigh. I had been hooked. I\'d like to say I was "conned" into doing it, but
I knew what I was getting into so I refuse to just blame it all on Ken
Whitman. So I set about to produce a series of Traveller modules, set a
schedule and began work.
So, within the time I had, I produced what I did. I was not happy with the
quality, but I knew I would never be. In the allotted testing time I
managed to kill all the major bugs, but the hardware I had to test on was
rather limited. It doesn\'t GPF on my machine, but Windows is not the most
consistent of operating systems and it is hardly surprising that it does on
others. I do wish I had time to test everywhere.
Getting release 1 out the door was tiring and adsorbed more of my time than
I would have liked. I decided to wait on doing release 2 & 3 until I could
see how they were going and what the reaction was.
Predictably, in such a limited market, sales were lukewarm. Predictably,
people complained about the quality. Predictably people hassled me about
Mac, Atari and ghod knows what other O/S versions. Not to mention irate
letters from people who didn\'t read the web-page, didn\'t ask for
clarification, didn\'t send an e-mail address, didn\'t send enough money and
didn\'t get a delivery. Conclusively, it wasn\'t worth continuing.
I hope this contextualisation at least brings some understanding of why it
is what it is. Yet Another Low Quality Traveller Product. The only defence
I can offer is that I deliberately argued a low price. Compared to $60 for
Campaign Cartographer, $10 for TravSuite isn\'t too bad.

>I know I\'d be more than willing to pay an extra $10 or so to get a fixed
version...
So, where do we go from here. I\'d much, much, rather that IG actually got
someone to do the job properly. This, however, is rather unlikely. I can\'t
see them up-fronting the money for a professional to do the effort. I\'m
unwilling to do much more unless they gave me a contract. Frankly, the
income from it hasn\'t been worth the hassle and the embarrassment of having
my name on something that doesn\'t match my own quality standards.
In all likelihood, it will quietly disappear from the marketplace with the
upcoming CORE web page design. After a suitable period of grace, for those
who paid money for it, it might emerge as shareware. However computers will
probably have outstripped it in usefulness by then.
Now if you all hassled IG, they _might_ take it on properly. I\'m happy to
pass on the code to someone they contract and wish them well with it. Ghod
knows, with the complexity of rules they are spewing out you _need_ a
computer to cope with it.

>If the software was working without the gpfs I\'d say its the best
worldmapping software I\'ve seen!
Actually, the best worldmapping software I\'ve seen was my previous LIBRARY
software, still available for free. It did proper continents, oceans and
stuff according to the WBH. Unfortunately it was developed in the days of
DOS before memory spillage managers. It is currently wildly unstable. Even
I have difficulty using it.
Currently I am messing with Java. All my WBH routines (sans world mapping,
sadly) have been ported to Java (package ttg). Additionally I have created
an OO object storage mechanism (package ttg.io) which allows you determine
your own storage strategy. I\'ve already drivers for straight file storage,
Galactic compatible storage, and want to write one for remote server
storage so it can be used on-line. Then I am building up a package of user
interface objects (ttg.ui) which will form fundamental building blocks for
applications. The first of which is a java version of a cross between Jim\'s
Galactic and my Library (ttg.gal). I\'m calling it "Java Gal", cause you
type "java gal" on the command line to start it :-).
It is all Traveller Tools Group stuff and, generally, I have no intention
of charging for the libraries. They are up on
ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/ttg. Those aren\'t the latest but it may
give you ideas. If you find what is there intriguing let me know and I\'ll
refresh them. JavaGal will probably be ready for testing in a few weeks.
There will be an announcement.

There you go. I\'m quite responsive without stimulation. And the above has
been relayed to almost anyone who has written to me asking. I\'m not sure it
helps any, but maybe someone else will see a wonderful way to do wonderful
things with the software.

loosely based off of Heinlein\'s work. For some reason, the wonks in
movieland decided that his short novel wasn\'t interesting enough as it is
to put on the screen. It probably has to do with the conservatism that big
money breeds (i.e., use only proven formulas, in this case "Aliens").

I\'m sure that a lot of extras in mock powersuits would be a logistical
problem for the filmmakers. To say that\'s why they dropped them might be
true, but that is besides the point. The thing is, if you were to do the
movie true to Heinlein\'s work, you wouldn\'t *need* a bunch of extras. The
troopers were usually out of direct line of sight from each other,
seperated by miles (or at least hundreds of meters). They kept formation
through telemetry information. For lone troopers, you could come up with a
workable mix of live action shots (troops in mock ups) and SFX stuff
(go-motion miniatures and CGI animation). The cases where you *do* have a
lot of troopers together in the book are pretty sedate, and you could
probably composite them without too much trouble. After all, I believe
almost all of the "arachnid horde action shots" (tm) are CGI compositions.

It seems to me that instead, it was just decided to remake a proven winner
on a bigger and "better" scale. Thus we have our Aliens-esque Starship
Troopers. Maybe this is some of the source of the friendly (?) competition
between the SFX teams of Starship Troopers and Alien: The Resurrection
noted in Millimeter magazine (which also opens soon).

It\'s interesting that a lot of the inspiration for Aliens was said to be
derived from Heinlein\'s book. That makes Starship Troopers a derivative of
a derivative with the name of the origninal! ;)

On to Traveller: While battle dress is not nearly as formidable as the
powersuits of the MI, do any of you think that some of the tactics might be
applicable? I am thinking of loose, fast moving formations, keeping track
of each other through the use of IFF transponders and the like. Battle
dress, being relatively small, would be able to make better use of a lot of
terrain advantages than larger vehicles, wouldn\'t it? At 300,000 Cr a suit
(MT) and armed with tac missiles, wouldn\'t these be pretty cost-effective
tank killers?

Also (for you lovable gearheads out there), *could* MI-like powersuits be
designed in the Traveller universe? Tac nukes, grenade racks, flamers and
all? Of course, the Imperium has some tech advantages that the Federal
government of the MI didn\'t have (grav belts, true HUDs, and so on). But
are MI-like powersuits truly technologically feasable, given the hard sf
nature of the Traveller universe? More importantly, would such a design be
economically feasable (assuming it was technologically possible)?

BTW, I have heard that in ST, the movie, there are giant Arachnids (called
tank bugs) that have the ability to emit plasma blasts from their abdomen
and shoot starships out of orbit. That\'s right folks, they are blasting
stuff out of orbit with a**-end emissions! If this rumor is true, I\'m sure
the movie is going to be a winner! :-(

I\'m sure some sort of automated alarm system can be worked out, but in a
crowded system, it\'ll go off far too often, requiring constant manning of
the sensors. But that\'s why sensors require a whole crew member.

Yes. What I do with any group of players is the first few sessions, be
really annoying about "Oh, but you didn\'t _say_ you turned on your
headlights...until they get the idea, and they come up with "This is our
SOP for XYZ" covering things like do we run with our passive sensors on or
what? Then I use that, and don\'t bug them. They learn in the
process...usually the first time or two when I hit them with something not
covered in the SOP, they change the SOP. 

Then, at random intervals, all the time, I roll dice behind my screen.
Most of the time they\'re meaningless noise, which helps keep the times
they\'re _supposed_ to be rolls the players don\'t know about much more
secret.

And _that\'s_ when I\'m rolling their sensor scans, surprise rolls, etc.

   He\'s right.  I\'ll bet that I\'ve known about Verhoven\'s \'Starship

   Remember that he also did "Basic Instinct" and "Showgirls."  Interesting

The basic rules (using logs etc) were laid down by (ahum) me and Bruce made
some very detailed real world calculations about reasonable ranges. Then
Bruce again wrote down some rules about rating ships and using the sensors.
I\'m not shure who decided on the (to me) silly use of decimal sensitivity
ratings I don\'t know, simply multiply all FF&S II figures by 2 and
everything will be much easier. Also, ignore the silly rule for lidars
involving the multiplication by 2 for unknown reasons.

Trick question, Leonard ;-)

Medieval, with access to a garbage dump from the past...only _smelting_
aluminum from bauxite takes electricity, recycling it takes a hot fire. An
old room-mate of mine showed me a sand cast aluminum pot made by people
who scavenged the city dump for aluminum cans, broken pots and other
aluminum sources, from where he was stationed by the Peace Corps. Looked
just like the cast iron one used to make the mold, except it was
considerably shinier.

A bit off-topic but...

The 2 week annual maintenance in my Universe is divided into 1 week actual
maintenace at 0.1% of new ships price. This involves replacing parts,
fixing Lightly damaged components (which in my system costs .1%
incidentally) and then checking the ships components as you do with cars.
the other week consists of a single insystem testjump (actually they jump
from planet A directly back to planet A to save time) to verify the proper
functioning of the J-drive.

I\'ve never had the Imperials misjump a PC ship yet but that is probably
because my players either have spanking nes ships (stolen) or ships so old
they never do annual maintenance except on their own.

   I am in total aggreement with your points 2 and 3.  Point 1, the
   plague, was not yet a player in Cortes\'s conquest.  It depleted the
   the population during the following colonization though.

   See my comment above.  It wasn\'t until the Franciscan missionaries
   began preaching to the indians and appealing to Europe for funds for
   hospitals that we have any records of plague outbreaks in Mexico.
   According to some theorists, 90% of the population disappeared during
   this time due to some mysterious reasons. (Plague, they say, can\'t
   account for it all.)  The disappearing population mystified the
   missionaries of that time, and still mystifies researchers today.

   This is an interesting point that was brought up the last time this
   thread came up on this list.  While such military scruples certainly
   confused the empire and gave Cortes some precious time, I have to
   doubt that they totally paralized the empire or were decisive in the
   conquest.
   
   I do not understand how your reference to femicide pertains to either
   European or Aztec warfare.
   
   ObTrav: The Spanish conquest of Mexico is the only historical event
   that I know of that in any way parallels the Solomani conquest of the
   first Imperium.  Lessons drawn from the one can be applied to the
   other.  My own personal feeling is that Vland fell to a military
   composed mostly of its own subjects led by Solomani officers.

My assumption is that there are indeed maneuvering thrusters subsumed in the
mass of the main thrusters - maybe about 10% of the thruster volume goes for
auxilliary thrusters at different orientations around the ship.

If you go with DGP\'s thrusters-work-sideways, you still have a problem for
HEPlaR ships - HEPlaR definitely can\'t fire sideways or in reverse...although
you could assume HEPlaR mass includes auxilliary manuevering thrusters while
T-plates don\'t. Still, it\'s not a big issue; allowing T-plates to work sideways
doesn\'t mess things up as much as allowing them to work at x4 or x10 overpower
some of the time does.

That\'s a good question; it leads into the general "how automated are
Traveller ships" question. It seems to be part of canon that ships aren\'t
particularly automated - in which case sensors only work if there\'s someone
operating them. There may not be a full-time sensor operator, but there
should usually be *someone* on the bridge - that one person would presumably
be keeping an eye on the sensor readouts among other things. You\'d use their
sensor skill for detection, maybe modified by -1 DM or so because they\'re
trying to do many things at once.

Alternatively, as an optional rule, you could say that sensors can be run in
an automatic scan-the-whole sky mode. In this mode they only detect targets
with a signature of +2 or more - and they detect those targets automatically.

Definitely. Just like any spot-the-hidden-thing roll. In fact, when I\'m
refereeing any sort of game I periodically make rolls behind the screen just
to mess with the player\'s tiny minds. (Asking questions like "What\'s the
pilot\'s sensor skill", "what\'s the pilot\'s engineering skill", or "what\'s the
lowers CON on the ship" help keep them suitably confused...)

It would probably take an hour or two - and during that hour you\'re a serious
menace to traffic, since you can\'t move with respect to the air at more than
20-30 mph, and the wind will move the air at 50-100 mph at altitude - thei
airspace over a starport full of unstreamlined spacecraft would be pretty
dangerous. I\'d say it\'s safe to assume that reasonable safety precautions 
require all ships that land on a planet with atmosphere to be streamlined
(which doesn\'t actually cost that much, anyway.)

Reflexes are fine, but we haven\'t done enough research to figure out what
fidelity of input data, and fidelity of response, humans need to have their own
reflexes effectively triggered.

Assume a suit which _does_ permit your reflexes to be used effectively.  But
when you\'re wearing a suit which amplifies your every move, your reflexes may
be wrong.  Your center of mass is different.  Your strength (which affects how
fast your legs or arms move when not touching anything) is greater.  That
railing you grabbed to stop your fall?  You just tore it off, and you are still
falling.

There are two ways to address this: (1) re-learn your reflexes.  (2) construct
the suit so that it translates your motions to appropriate suit motions.
Re-learning your reflexes... I\'m not convinced that they could be deeply enough
ingrained in a reasonable amount of time that they could be reliable enough in
a combat situation.  That\'s my own personal bias.

Hence, I would put reseach at this TL, something commercially usable in
controlled circumstances (where you learn the reflexes, but are not in
situations where time is critical) at the next TL, and something where reflexes
can be translated to appropriate suit motion at the TL after that.

My argument is that the truck is an extreme example of what the suit would do.
It is very unlike the way we locomote; however a strength-inducing exosuit is
also unlike the way we locomote (although closer than the truck).

Key word: walk.
Walking has a strictly limited forward speed, a function of leg length and
gravity.  For speed, you need to run.  That\'s a whole different bucket of
bolts.

Actually, you don\'t have to copy them from ants.  You can make them up with
finite state machines, it\'s not too hard.  Or you can copy the raw motion
patterns from existing creatures.  Been there, done that.  The problem
is when they fail, they fail.  They don\'t know enough about the world around
them to avoid failure.  They don\'t know not to bash their leg into that rock -
they just rely on the leg being stronger than that rock.  Nor do they know not
to bash their leg into that other walker\'s leg... which leg gives?  Someone\'s
machine just broke....

Anyway, I have a moral objection to copying a controller or motion pattern from
something else and saying "now we know how it works."  That\'s what Honda did.

Insects are klutzes.  A cockroach will run smack into a step, bump his head,
flail his legs around, hit his abdomen on the floor, and eventually get a
foothold to climb over the step.  This behavior is great for small things, but
does not scale up to larger sizes.  "Insect neural nets" with some tweaking
will result in a working small robot, but a broken large one.


How many legs you want on your robot... each leg you put on gives a bunch more
pieces to break or freeze in place.  You also need to coordinate them.  Each
leg you remove is less weight, less to coordinate, fewer items to build, and a
bigger control problem.

My guess is we\'ll end up with 4-legged walkers - if you run, you can run on
down toa single pair of legs if things break (or just one leg, depending on the
construction), and 4 legs gives a nice stable stopping position.  3 legs
doesn\'t have the option of statically stable walking.  6 legs is more repairs.


Six-legged vs four-legged is only more stable when doing statically stable
walking, which has speed limits too severe for cross-country use.

Case in point for speed limits:
Adaptive Suspension Vehicle
Dimensions:  17 feet length. 10 feet height. 8 foot track width.
Weight: 6000 pound dry weight.
Payload: 500 pound.
Speed: 5mph cruise speed.
Grade climb ability: 60% gradient.
Mobility:
	Ditch crossing: 6 feet.
	Vertical step crossing: 5.5 feet.
	Isolated wall crossing: 4.5 feet.
	Fording depth: 4 feet.

The 5mph cruise speed is not a typo, it\'s a result of the fact that it is
statically stable.

I challenge you to find me an existing _walking_ robot which can go above
10mph, on legs.


So you need to run.  And to run, you have to be able to analyze the ground in
front of you for footholds, and figure out which footholds to use.  Which means
you have to solve computer vision, or have approximately flat terrain.

Think of a hovercraft, or an extremely low-draft boat.  The wind rotates it,
easily.  A huge hovercraft... well, you\'d need hurricane force winds. :>

The point of that part of my post, however, was to try to come up with
situations where legs _would_ be useful.  Swamps, deserts, high winds.  Rough
terrain.  Then I needed an explaination why antigrav wouldn\'t be an easier way
to get there.  Sure, if you want, you can say antigrav can also provide it
horizontal motive power... but that\'s no fun.

None, it was an orbital refinery at a gas giant (from the old white dwarf
scenario Sky Rig). All the players died in a big nasty explosion after they
attached 5 breaching charges to the big nasty monster sucked into one of
the fuel tanks.

That is, apart from the two who made it to a ramjet one-shot life raft and
got up to orbit.

And then died when the orbit decayed and they blew the three rolls they had
to get rescued.

Ahhh! Poetry!

A hydrogen refinery on a planet? In a city? Now that is an idea!

Yes, I\'ve seen these.  But I took these to be for the backup
jet-thrusters used only for slow orientation if the M-Drive goes out (as
stated in the SOM).

I agree.  That\'s why I\'m questioning T4 Thrusters only providing thrust
in one direction as Bruce as mentioned.

In MT, Thruster plates produced most of their thrust in one direction,
100% of the G-Rating "to the rear".

But, the SOM for MT also specified that Thruster plates could provide
some thrust--a fraction of the thrust "to the rear"--in other
directions.

The SOM has it like this:

100% thrust "to the rear"
25% thrust "to the sides"
10% thrust "in reverse"

Using this model for thruster plates, you can maneuver with them too. 
You don\'t need to rely on backup jet thrusters.

This makes more sense to me than having T4 plates only produce thrust in
one direction.

Well, we can talk about how bright the signature is, whether the
sensor (and the abilities of it are right there in the rules)
is good enough to reliably detect a ship so you can always get
away.  However, we don\'t have to.  Becuase the answer is "they don\'t".

Pirates are, by definition, operating in a area with significant
commercial traffic and nothing in their signature certainly
isn\'t coded to say "pirate".

Curious.  As Denzel Washington said in Philidelphia, "Can you explain it

I\'m not sure I follow how the DGP overdrive capability messes things

I\'m not even sure that the existing BattleDress is economically feasable.
300,000Cr buys a lot of conventional equipment. Also, like fighter pilots,
the cost of training necessary for someone in Battle Dress far outstrips
the cost of the hardware making them even more expensive.
I generally rationalise battle dress in one of a number of ways:
1) It is an arms race thing. If one side has battle dress and the other
doesn\'t they have a distinct advantage. But, if one side has _more_ battle
dress thant he other, it isn\'t as much of an advantage. Thus competing
polities invest in one elite squad of battle dress troops but stop there.
They also almost never use them in action. Their use is as a threat of
force, not a force itself (a bit like nukes today).
2) It is for show. Battle Dress is impressive. I\'ve always assumed that the
Imperial troops keep a certain number of Battle Dress squads to "fly the
flag", flank the Emporer, stand in front of the Imperial Embassy to
encourage rioters to disperse, etc, etc.
3) Was at the Met in New York the weekend before last. Lots of amazingly
impressive armour. However almost every suit was owned by a high noble of
some such. The historical reason they were so impressive was they were
either for court duty, or, if some damn noble was going to risk his life
jousting, he damn better have the best armour possible. Analogously, Battle
Dress is almost exclusively owned by Nobles so they can lead their levied
troops in battle and not get their arse shot off.

>The thing is, if you were to do the movie true to Heinlein\'s work,
>you wouldn\'t *need* a bunch of extras.
But it wouldn\'t be any where near as visually exciting. One bozo buzzing
around talking over his walkie talkie to other bozos flying out of sight
just doesn\'t cut it.
It is like the Enterprise shouldn\'t go "wooosh" as it passes in the credits
because there is no sound in space. But when they filmed it that way it
just didn\'t fly (so to speak).
I have a fair amount of experience of medieval fighting. Films like
Braveheart come close, but are still lacking in accuracy in a large number
of details. But, if they had done it to the strict accuracy of my
experience, it wouldn\'t have been nearly as interesting. So I don\'t
complain. Much.
Films are entertainment. (Role-playing is reality! :-)

    'body' => 'Me and my players are learning Bruce\'s Definitive Sensor Rules for T4.

We are completeing this via e-mail before our next game in two weeks. 
Last game, they were hauling ass away from Pysadi, in a hurry  to get
their missing crewman from a Pysadian jail on the other side of the
planet.

The starport was tracking them to orbit, and they were going to leave
starport sensor range, then swing around (the TL 4) planet, land at the
city where the crewman is being held, and break him out before
high-tailing it to jump point.

Well, what they don\'t know is that the Pysadian government, albeit they
are TL 4, has hired a merchant vessel as a sort of security arm against
just this type of action.

The Pysadians my be rag-heads, but they are not stupid.  There\'s an
order that\'s just gone out to the city where the crewmember is being
held to transfer the prisoner to the maximum security facility in Sadi,
the planet\'s capital.

Of course, this is going to take about 4 days, so that\'s the window my
players have to deal witht he hired ship in orbit and rescue their
shipmate.

We\'re playing the Traveller Adventure if you haven\'t guessed.  This is
the first time in our game that sensors have become important--the
starport is tracking them to make sure they don\'t double back, their is
a potentially hostile ship in orbit, and they need to get back down to
the planet, covertly if possible, and break out the incarcerated
shipmate.

In between games, we are all learning to use the new sensor rules from
FF&S2 and Bruce\'s post on Definitive Sensor rules.

I thought it might be helpful if I posted these posts up for other
players interested.  If you are already using Bruce\'s sensor rules, or
don\'t care to, these posts will be useless to you.  If you are learning
them, like I am, then you might find some use in them.

Some of this might even spark discussion on the TML, which is always
good for the learning process.

Kenneth.




(the following is re-posted material from my game e-mails to my players)

We are learning these new T4 sensor rules together.

I down loaded Bruce\'s Definitive Sensor Rules last night, and I read the
first section detailing Basic sensor operation.

This post is designed to help you learn the sensor rules.  We\'ll look at
each of the three sections (Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced) together.

BEFORE you read through this post, you should have done two things.

1)  You should have re-read the section on sensors in the SOM Chapter 5
mailout, and you should have read the recent e-mail posts I sent you
yesterday.

If you haven\'t done this yet, then do it before you continue with this
post.  What this will do is put us all on the same page as far as
definitions go.  These readings will teach you what a passive sensor is,
what an active sensor is, and the different types of sensors.

The Harrier has one passive EMS package and one active EMS package.  You
should know (from the SOM) what the EMS sensors are.  You should also
know about scanners and trackers (from my posts)--that scanners are used
for scanning wide areas whereas trackers are used for sensor locks for
fire control.

So, do you know what an active sensor is?  A passive sensor?  A
scanner?  A tracker?  A EMS sensor?  If so, continue.  If not, go back
and reread Chapter 5 of the SOM and myu recent posts.

2)  The second thing you should have done is downloaded the T4 sensor
rules by Bruce Alan Macintosh from that web site I forwarded to you. 
You should have read through them once, but understanding them clearly
is not necessary at this point.

Understanding sensors is the goal of this series of inbetween-game
posts.

Get those two things done.  In the next post, we\'ll go through basic
sensor procedures together.

I just wanted to pass on a bit of good fortune. I was browsing my local 
Barnes and Noble and I found several copies of Michael Whelan\'s $60 
hardcover art book "The Art of Michael Whelan" for $20 on the bargain table.

Check out http://www.glassonion.com/artbooks.htm for the contents. I was 
amazed at the color quality of the printed page. The web page doesn\'t do it 
justice. Lots of good Travelleresque science fiction paper back covers are 
included like Piper\'s Fuzzy series, Cherryh\'s Chanurs series and some Niven.

I wouldn\'t have paid $60 but $20 is a good deal.

(the following is re-posted material from my game)



The March Harrier

Sensors are used for two main purposes--for detecting objects that you
didn\'t know was there and for obtaining a fire-control lock (or a sensor
lock for more detailed information about the object).

The March Harrier has two sensor packages--one active EMS package and
one passive EMS package.  Both of these packages contain both scanner
and tracker type sensors, so they are both considered combination sensor
packages.

     Active EMS Sensor package (contains scanners and trackers)

     Passive EMS Sensor package (contains scanners and trackers)



March Harrier Game Stats

     Active EMS Sensor package:  Sensitivity Rating 12
     Passive EMS Sensor package:  Sensitivity Rating 14

     Signature vs. Active Sensors:  Active Signature Rating +0.5
     Infrared Signature vs. Passive Sensors:  Emitted Signature Rating
0*
     Visible Signature vs. Passive Sensors:  Reflected Signature Rating
- -0.5  



*Note:  You can change the Emitted Passive Signature rating by reducing
power to the ship\'s systems.  Since the March Harrier\'s Emitted Sig.
rating is 0, you can lower this to a negative number by reducing power
(or completely shutting off power) from the power plant.  If this is
done, look at the table in Part 3 of the Definitive Sensor Rules to look
up the new Emitted Sig rating.

RAH covered this part well in his suit training bits...this was where they
lost the greatest number of recruits to death and disables, during suit
training. He makes exactly the point that your reflexes have to be
retrained. Also, he makes the explicit point that the systems in the suit
are optimized to working _with_ you not against you.

As for deeply ingraining reflexes...there are _lots_ of instances where
relying on untrained reflexes while using machinery can be fatal...flying
combat maneuvers in an F-16, for instance, or operating a crane. That\'s
why pilots train, train, and train some more, and then train for good
measure. 

The MI in ST are considered elite troops, like fighter pilots today, and I
assume that their training is equally intensive.

Besides, have you ever ridden a bike? Driven a car? Can you handle one in
an emergency? Do you consiously think about each step? Congratulations,
you\'ve gotten \'deeply ingrained reflexes\' completely contrary to those
required for walking or any other natural human motion, and I\'m sure you
learned them in a reasonable amount of time.

CHAMELEON HULL

The March Harrier\'s hull incorporates a chemeleon circuit.

This is pretty standard on higher tech spacecraft.  You can look it up
to find out the specifics of a chameleon hull in Chapter 7 of the SOM: 
Hull and Environment.

Here\'s what the SOM says about chameleon hulls:

"All hulls incorporate within them a series of thermal radiator strips
which permit the vessel to dissiate excess heat which might be hazardous
to the crew of the ship.

"At times of extreme energy production (such as during the preparation
for jump) these strips can grow visibly hot as they shed unwanted heat.

"The chameleon circuit used on many higher-tech starships allows them to
alter their appearance.  The hull circuit alters the frequency of
elctromagnetic energy (usually limited to the IR, visible light, and UV
segments of the spectrum) reflected or emitted by the ship.

"A series of refinements in material science, gravitics, and nuclear
damper technology allows altering the hull surface so that it absorbs
more or less light.  By selecting different frequencies, the apearance
of the craft can be altered to our eyes and even to sensors."

GENERAL INFORMATION ON USING CHAMELEON HULLS

"The chameleon circuit in many starship hulls allows the ship to do a
number of interesting things.  In addition to altering the ship\'s
external color, this technology can be used to disguise the ship if it
has landed in the wilderness, for example.  The reverse is also
possible, of course:  crashed or disabled starships with chameleon hulls
can be turned fluorescent orange to make its location obvious to search
teams.

"Exacting computer control over the circuit which manifests this
function even allows patterns to be created on the hull, hearalds to be
displayed, or names to become lettered as desired.  

"Nearly all starships make use of this device to customize the ship in
some way on a portion of the hull.  Solomani traditionally decorate the
nose of a craft, while Zhodani color the tail sections, and the Vilani
stylize the underside of the ship.  

"Other races often employ their own unique methods of customization.

"Pirates and privateers often make use of chemeleon hulls to strike
terror into the hearts of potential victims.  A pirate ship will often
close on another craft using false transponder identification and then
suddenly turn jet black as it comes within visual range.  


"A touch sometimes seen among Solomani pirates is the display of a great
white skull and crossbones on the exterior of the hull.  Vilani pirates
often make use of their traditional flaming eye in a similar manner."

In combat situations, it is normal for a starship to darken its hull to
be as black as possible.  This will lower the ship\'s reflected signature
when passive sensors are being used to detect it.

I agree with your other points about construction time and Tigress costs 
(deliberate simplifications on my part), but I do not agree with this.  
Page 33 of TCS states:

"Each planet\'s shipyards have a maximum capacity expressed in the number of 
tons of ships they may work on at a time (including repair and refit 
operation)"

I can find no mention in TCS (or elsewhere) that this capacity is only for 
military vessels, and based on the real world I do not believe that a 
stable economy (such as the Imperium) would need naval ship-building 
facilities capable of building a fleet 8x larger than their naval budget 
can support.

Based on my earlier analysis and my limited knowledge of current (very 
little) military ship building I would say that the TCS ship building 
capacity is definitely for civilian as well as naval use ... in time of 
tension (or war) a much larger fraction of the shipyards will be given to 
naval work (new and refits).

There is some scope for arguement, as TCS has a "Government Modifier" that 
is different for peace and war, but for the common Gov types associated 
with Pop 9+ worlds, the variation is small and can be explained as 
increased workforce (shift working, longer hours) just as easily as 
assuming additional civilian yards are commandeered.


I think that my most significant point is worth making again: I do not 
believe that a stable economy (such as the Imperium) would need naval 
ship-building facilities capable of building a fleet 8x larger than their 
naval budget can support.

SSDS does account for ROF, if you have a ROF =50 you get +1 to damage,
if you have ROF=100 you get +2, etc. (Note the exact bonuses may be
off, I can\'t remember for sure)  You can\'t do more than double the
damage of the weapon, no 1 Mw lasers at ROF=10000. :)

A *little* effort on most unstreamlined hulls would allow it to travel
through an atmosphere at 100 to 200 kph. Sensor arrays, antenna,
external hooks and grapples could be designed to be retracted and
covered, for instance.  As a general rule, SL/AF hulls would be be
preferred, and could lift/land without negative DM\'s. USL hulls should
be allowed to do so with increased difficulty, chances of minor (or
major) damage, and if it\'s a planned thing only in out of the way places
(like over an ocean).

In my fictons, ships >100 tons are designed to routinely land and lift
from bodies of water, oceans, seas, lakes, or man-made basins for that
matter.  Only if they *have* to will they put down on land. The water
provides bouyance when the CG\'s are shut down.  Lifting involves using
the CG/AG units to lift the ship out of the water and accelerate it
above the atmosphere where the stutterjump drives can be brought on
line.

I was trying to match what I was told the T4.1 range bands would be.
In hindsight, this may have been a mistake...would people rather have to
deal with adding fractions together (sensitivities like 10.5 + range 9.5 +
signature -0.5 = 19.5) or with doubling the T4 ranges? (
sensitivity 21, range=9*2=18)

There\'s a statement in there that "Lidar signature = visible (reflected)
signature *divided* by 2", which should stay...

Neutrino signatures are damn hard to detect - certainly nearly impossible
at useful ranges with TL-8 equipment. My addenda to FFS2 have more advanced
neutrino sensors, but they\'re still pretty short ranged (if nothing else, 
they have to deal with the background neutrino signal from the local star...)

On the other hand, big planetary-defence IR/radar/visible sensors can track
ships halfway across the solar system.

On the final hand, as someone says, pirates don\'t have to hide - just look
innocent until they get into weapons range.

It opens various cans of larvae. Why don\'t ships use this overdrive
capacity (which DGP implied was as high as a factor of 10!) in combat
while evading? Why don\'t missiles use it all the time? (Who cares if the
missile\'s drive burns out in 10 minutes if it can manuever at 100G for those
ten minutes...) Can you last longer at overdrive if you maintain and tune
your drive better? If that\'s the case, why don\'t well-tuned thruster plates
generally have a higher efficiency? Why don\'t thurster plates get better 
with TL? What, precisely, *is* it that burns out when you\'re overdriving,
given that thurster plates have no moving parts? If it\'s an overheating thing
why not just have better cooling? Why don\'t thruster plates require 10x more
power when producing 10x more thrust? 

See? Lots of hard questions that we don\'t have rules for.

Including CG on most ships is now cannon (I think it\'s even built into 
some QSDS or SSDS hulls...) so overdriven thruster plates are no longer
required.

Battle Dress equipped troops really have only one use: Raiders.  They lack

heat they generate will, after a time, make them targets for IR-homing
munitions.

Just as a modern MBT is dead if it stands still, A Marine will need to keep
moving to survive.  I can design a TL8 Light Antiarmor Missile that will
shred both the armor and the body inside it.

BD\'s big advantage is it\'s small size and manuverability.  A grav tank will
blow up a building.  A Marine will kick in the door, chase you downstairs,
and slap you unconscious.

IMTU Marines make great use of IFF beacons and loose formations.  Since
each mission will have a clearly phrased objective for each unit (seize the
control tower; capture the command staff in bunker "G"; destroy the
munitions store) each trooper will know his/her job in the mission, as well
as having cues displayed on the HUD.

I\'ll take a stab at the grenade launcher this afternoon.  Since Traveller
has grav belts, making MI-like jumps wopuld be easier for the average
Imperial Marine than it was for Juan Rico.  I imagine Marine
Sergeants-Instructor take great care to keep their charges from spending
more than two or three seconds airborne at any time, to avoid attracting AA
fire.

I\'ve always held that BattleDress is fairly worthless on a conventional
battlefield, simply because it is an attractive target and a relatively
easy kill.  Not enough armor to really stand up to an infantry anti-armor
rocket, and not enough weaponry to compete with armored vehicles.  It is at
best a specialty piece of equipment for certain, narrowly defined missions.

A better example would be the Infantry Fighting Vehicles.  The Russkis had
infantry carries that could also shoot and fire missiles and were generally
cooler than our little M-113s that just hauled a dozen troops and all of
their equipment while running on anything more reactive than urine.  So we
had to replace them with the Bradley, which costs twice as much, carries
half as many troops, and requires special training to drive.

(Sorry, sore point with me, I was in the unit that tested the Bradley, and
I still hate the damn things.)

If you count the platoon of Imperial Marines reducing your Naval HQ to a
collection of fine pebbles and office shards a demonstration, you\'re on the
right track.  I imagine that a big part of "Fleet Week" or whatever on
local worlds will be the Marines demonstrating their toys to the locals.
As I was told in the Army that airshows and the like are important to show
the people what they\'ve paid for, and that it works.  Having two Marines in
BD visit the local high-school equivilants could do wonders for the
recruiting office\'s numbers.

If BD had to be manufactured by hand using TL2 technology, I could see
this.  How ever, somewhere on sylea there is a factory that does nothing
but assemble Mk-38 Personal Protection System (Augmented) kits for the
Imperium.

What\'s interesting is the special orders they\'d recieve.. ("He wants
WHAT???  ABD that looks like *jousting armor*!!!")

Escape velocity is the velocity you will be going when you break free of
the planets gravity. The usual problem is carrying enough fuel to get you,
and the fuel, going at the escape velocity.  The usual solution is that of
the Shuttle or the Saturn V.  A big powerful engine that blasts you to the
escape velocity as quick as possible before the fuel runs out.  If you can
get a very powerful fuel ie one which has an enormous power to weight ratio
you do not have to have the brutal acceleration and all that cheek
wobbling.

This latter case is the one for the CG/plates if you can go at 1.001G you
will eventally reach orbit if your fuel lasts; it will just take a long
time. If you can get up 6Gs you will get to orbit that liitle bit quicker.
When you both reach orbit you will both be going at the escape velocity.

	That true. A full grown programs get in the range of several

	Funny GAL23 was also the start of my project. You can see it

	Sounds like public domain ;-( Do you know the University Ingres story.
	Public domain is neither good for authors nor for the project.

	I have the rules (MT&TNE) I think that my FFS has a wear value
	of about 7 while some MT stuff is not in better condition.

	The (n+1)% size is the MT/TNE size for a jump drive,
	multiplied by 5 for fuel for n parsecs, or (n+1)*5/n
	for 1 parsec. So fuel used more efficient by a larger
	drives possible at higher techlevels.

	The (n+1)% size is the CT/T4 is the same size for a jump drive
	but fuel efficency does not increase but sticks with 10% per
	parsec.

	This canon leads directy to useless CT-Gazelles, while the
	TNE/MT Gazelle is a nice ship. Of course you can call CT-TAS
	drop tanks canon. In my universe they produce 2d20 damage
	in jump drive and power plant, because of HPG overcharge.

> Maybe it should be - but under canon it is not possible.

	think about the following situation :

	You have a Tl10 200dt Yacht. The engineer tells you that
	the HPG of your jump drive is broken, and can not be repaired.
	Fortunately you are on a Tl12 world and HPGs are available,
	the chief looks into the Jumpdrives manual and deceided that
	you need 230 MJ of HPG, as this was the old value. After some
	days of work he removed the old HPG (18qm) and you order the
	new one (cost is only 115 Sylean KCr converted to 130 Kaneshi KCr)
	the new HPG is delivered and after installation there is 6qm
	open space. The discussion arise what to make with the 6qm?
	An additional locker, or if its better just to purchase addional
	110 MJ HPGs as the HPGs are mechanical and having a bigger
	backup is allways better. Lets imagine if this situation happens
	in the wilds, its certainly better to have a backup. Do you remeber
	we only managed to continue jump because I\'ve stripped the laser
	HPG. Come give this additional 65KCr to make the HPG banks full.

	" 35 percent of the volume of a jump drive consists of capacitator

	My second asumption is a house rule which limits lasers
	to 50*Tl Mjoule and HPGs to 25*Tl Mjoule, to avoid "uncanon"
	constructions like the 2000Mjoule XRay laser, or that all
	lasers in a ship sharing a single HPG round robin. I hope
	that at least the first house rule found its way to FFS2.

	The "Special" columne is purely handwaving of

		MTJumpFuelVolume*MW/(20*(Jump+1)^2).

	Call it the ancient jump drive constant ;-)

	Using this ancient knowledge of how a jump drive works, it should
	be posible to produce better jump drives on moderate techlevels,
	than the early 3I did. I think that discovery of ancient papers
	in the late 3I leads to better drives. Compare fuel efficency of
	the old CT drives to the MT drives, and think about what scenarios
	where played in between. Further improvements lead to then
	conclusion that the human race (including solmani and vilani) has
	to be called minor, as the only jump drive improvements came from
	artifacts, or AI calculations (jump torpedos).

This depends greatly on how big the area is, and how many ships/scanners
are needed to patrol it.  Even if you assume that people will be scooting
about in system, which the rules as stated do not encourage, you stand a
good chance of being identified.

Given that an Aricebo-style dish is sufficient to scan the entire system
(and a system a few parsecs away for active sensors), I suspect traffic
control knows  everyone within 100 diameters of the destinations in the
system, and probably has good ideas about just about everyone in the system
period.

You might well be able to hit a target by surprise, but you cannot do it
twice in the same system, and since traffic control can probably ID you as
soon as they find out about the piracy, they know who you are.  Once you
are known as a pirate, you can be found.

The new senor rules make it very hard to hide in a way that will not bite
you if you intend to be taken for normal commercial traffic later.

	Not all fusion reactions give off neutrinos. In particular, I was rather
fond of the HIWG document describing, in great roleplaying detail, how a
CNO cycle reactor would work, and wanted to get permission to include it in
the "color" text for FF&S2.

	Where\'d this come from? I envisioned FF&S thrusters functioning pretty
much the same as in MT, although I didn\'t get that bit of color written
into the text... I suppose we could ask Marc for a "canon" ruling if it
really matters. But not now--let the man work on T4.1...

	While I\'m firmly on the side that USL ships can _try_ to land on worlds
with atmospheres, it\'s not as simple as just slowly drifting up under CG
.... high altitude winds and gust can seriously damage an unstreamlined ship
by snapping off antennas, or even more significant portions of the ship if
it\'s dispersed, as well as causing serious control problems. Yes, you can
match your speed to the local airspeed to avoid the problems from
steady-state winds (for example, here on earth, the jet stream runs around
200mph); avoid that, and you still have to deal with unpredictable,
surprise gusts of 50-100mph.

mathematician in Israel has proven that the Bible contains predictions
in it prediciting events in modern times--and they do it pretty
convincingly, I might add.

But, this is not what this post is about.  

In this book, there is talk of the 5th dimension, and since this is
somewhat Traveller related, I thought all of you might be interested in
this.

The author of the book, a reporter formally with the Washington Post and
Wall Street Journal, found reference to a "5th dimension" in the Bible
Code.

He says in his notes to chapter one:

"The code\'s suggestion that there is a \'fifth dimension\' led me to meet
with the chairman of Harvard\'s physics department, Sidney Coleman, and
one of the leading experts on the origin of the universe, M.I.T.
physicist Alan Guth.  Both told me, in separate interviews, that most
physicists now agree that there is a fifth dimension, but that no one
can yet define what it is.  Both, however, stated an apparent
paradox--that the fifth dimension is smaller than the nucleus of an
atom, but that we, our whole universe, are inside it."

Now, what do you TML physicists think of that?

To wax spiritual on you, I\'ll continue the quote.

"The ancient religious text cited by Rips in The Book of Creation (Sefer
Yetzirah), which according to legend was first written by the patriarch
Abraham, a thousand years before Moses received the Bible on Mt. Sinai. 
The Book of Creation states that we exist in a five-dimensional world,
three dimensions of space, a fourth dimension of time, and a fifth
spiritual dimension.  Modern science confirms the first four, and has no
definition of the fifth.

"Chapter One, verse five of The Book of Creation defines the five
dimensions this way:  \'A depth of beginning/A depth of end, A depth of
good/A depth of evil, A depth of above/A depth of below, A depth of
east/A depth of west, A depth of north/A depth of south.\'  The Book of
Creation, translated by Aryeh Kaplan (samuel Weiser, 1990), p. 44.

"Rips, in citing this ancient definition of the \'fifth dimension\', noted
that every dimension is defined by a system of measurment, and that the
fifth dimension may contain all the others because it is defined by the
distance between good and evil, and that, said Rips, \'is the greatest
distance in the world.\'

Facinating, facinating stuff.

the T4 Definitive Sensor Rules.

Kenneth.
==========================================================

(the following is copied from a post I sent to my players)


In this post, we walk through the basic rules for sensors listed in the
Definitive Sensor Rules.

Follow me (with your copy of the Definitive Sensor Rules) as we go
through that first section of rules.  I think you\'ll find it is easier
than it looks.  We are looking at the section titled "Part 2:  Basic
Rules".
- ----

BASIC SENSOR RULES

The basic sensor rules are really a two step process.  First you figure
how strong the signal is to the target ship you are trying to detect,
and then you look up that signal strength on a table given in the rules
to find the difficulty of the sensor task throw for the person operating
the sensors.

That\'s not very difficult.

- ----

STEP ONE:  FIGURING SIGNAL
To detect another starship or object using your sensors, you need to
calculate the signal.

     Signal = Sensitivity - Range + Signature + Modifiers



STEP TWO:  FINDING THE SENSOR TASK THROW
It\'s simple, really.  We plug numbers into the equation above to find
the signal strength.  Then we simply look up that signal strength on the
signal difficulty table to find the task throw the sensor operator needs
to make to detect the ship.

- ----

Let\'s go through step one and figure a signal.

FIGURING SENSITIVITY
In the last post, I told you that the March Harrier had two sensor
packages, and active EMS package and a passive EMS package.  Sensitivity
for those two packages on the Harrier were listed at:

     Active EMS sensitivity rating 12
     Passive EMS sensitivity rating 14

Pick which sensor you want to use, and use that sensitivity rating in
the equation.



FIGURING RANGE
To find the range number used in the signal calculation, simply look at
the map board or ask you GM what the range to the target is.  Then, look
up the range on the table in the rules to find the range factor.



FIGURING SIGNATURE
Each ship has a signature.  Remember last post I told you what the March
Harrier\'s signatures were:

      Signature vs active sensors:  Sig rating +0.5
      Signature vs passive sensors:  Emitted Sig rating 0
      Signature vs passive sensors:  Reflected Sig rating -0.5

The signature you use in the signal calculation is the signature rating
of the ship you are trying to detect.  Just like the March Harrier, this
ship will have different signatures based on which sensors you are
using.



FIGURING MODIFIERS
The ship being detected can do a lot of things to alter its signal.  It
can not move, lowering its signal. It can shut down all power, lowering
its signal.  It can use its active sensors, raising its signal.  

Also, other factors might change the signal, like if the ship is
surprised by your ship, if the ship is close to a planet or asteroid, if
the ship is in an atmosphere, or if the ship has landed--these all can
effect the ship\'s signal.

Each of these conditions has a modifier to the signal.  Simply check the
table in the rules for the modifiers used based on the situations that
apply.

- ----

Let\'s move through an example now.

The March Harrier tries to detect a ship 50,000,000 km.  Praygor or
Gvoudzon (the ship\'s captain or sensor operator) decides to use the
Harrier\'s passive EMS sensors.  We see that the Harrier\'s passive
sensors have a senstivity rating of 14.  The target ship\'s emitted
signature vs. passive sensors is 0.

We look up 50,000,000 km on the range table in the rules.  We see that
his corresponds to a range factor of 13.  The target ship is not moving,
so we look on the modifiers table to see that non-maneuvering
corresponds to a modifier of -0.5 for passive sensors.

Now we have all we need to figure a sensor task throw for Gvoudzon, the
Harrier\'s sensor operator.

Signal = Sensitivity - Range + Signature + Modifiers
  0.5  =     14      -   13  +     0     +   -0.5

Our signal is 0.5.  We look this up on the signal difficulty table in
the rules, and we see that Gvoudzon has to roll a Staggering sensor task
roll to detect this ship.

Now, that\'s pretty doggone easy (the figuring, not the task roll) isn\'t
it?

- ----

What do you get if you make the task roll?

The referee informs the players of the signature of the vessel (up until
now, they didn\'t know).  The counter is placed, upside down, on the map
to let you know the vessel\'s location.  

After one turn of detection, the referee gives the players more info on
the detected ship (Gvoudzon has had time to collect and analyze more
data).  You are now told the tonnage and basic configuration of the
target.  After two turns of detection, you are told more specifics, like
the ship\'s class.

Remember, turns in starship combat are 30 minutes long.

- ----

Firing Weapons

A casual sensor scan, like the one we\'ve been talking about, does not
provide enough (specific enough) information for a weapons lock.  A
weapons lock is necessary in order to fire the ship\'s weapons.

"Captain!  They\'re locking weapons!"

In order to make a weapons lock, you follow the same procedure as
detailed above, except with a modifier of -1.5.  Firing on a target is
much more difficult than merely detecting it.

- ----

Firing Weapons Without a Weapons Lock

You can just take your best guess and fire at a target with the
information you have.  If you do this, figure the task difficulty just
like you would if you had a weapon\'s lock, but increase the gunner\'s
task difficulty to fire by 3 levels.



And...that\'s it for the basic rules.  E-mail me if you have any
questions.

I\'m not sure if I agree with this.  I like the thinking behind Jo\'s
statement, but Traveller allows people with Vac Suit skill to operate
BattleDress.

I\'m sure Vac Suit is a much more common skill--with merchants needing to
do EVA repair jobs from time to time, asteroid miners hulking about,
common emergency training for crews on luxury lines and such.

Now, if BattleDress skill didn\'t default to Vac Suit, I could see Jo\'s
statement more clearly.  BattleDress skill is hard to obtain.

But, it is clear that anybody that can operate a vac suit can also
operate BattleDress.

What do you think, Jo?

Ok, are you saying Pirates can pretend to be "just one of the boys" in a
crowded shipping lane, before pouncing like a shark?  I\'d think Pirates
would operate in remote areas or try to catch ships alone.

Though the small print in the lobby displays still claims "based on a book

Fuel for one thing.  Jet thrusters are a reaction drive, no?  Or does it
just push air out--something that it can steal from other areas of the
ship?

Also, I don\'t see jet-thrusters producing thrust equivalent to thruster
plates.  It seems that jet thrusters are last ditch systems that you use
when you M-Drive goes out.  In space combat, I\'ll let a ship orient
itself with the jet-thrusters, but its effective speed is zero.  I don\'t
see a space ship pulling 1 G with these little orientation
jet-thrusters.

It would like trying to steer the Queen Elizabeth with one paddle.

I\'ve got a request for you--something that will probably just take you a
second.

I\'d like to have a better guideline as to what a referee can tell his
player when they obtain a sensor target or sensor lock.  You hinted at
this at the end of the Basic Rules section of your Definitive Sensor
Rules.  I\'m imagining something like...

Active EMS Scan:  1st turn--signal strength and target location.
                  2nd turn--tonnage, basic configuration, and power
plant rating (or                             MW currently put out by the
power plant if ref\'s want to                             determine
that).
                  3rd turn--class.



Active EMS Lock:  1st turn--all the information listed above for all
three turns.



Passive EMS Scan:  1st turn--?


See what I\'m getting at here?  It would be nice to see some
differentation between the sensors.  The difference between an Active
EMS Scan and an Active EMS Lock is that you get all the information with
a lock whereas the Active EMS Scan gives you the information slowly in
three turns.

How will the information retrieval on the target be different from
Passive EMS scans and locks?

What type of information do you get if you use a neutrino sensor?  What
about a densitometer?

What type of sensor is best for detecting weapons on the target craft?

What type of scan and sensor is best for detecting if they are locking
weapons on your ship?

Would it be to hard to add a rules section to your Definitive Sensor
Rules, detailing each of the types of sensors available in Traveller and
the types of information that those sensors will give you?

I think this will be an invaluable role playing aid.

Bam.  The players have located a target...but that\'s all they know.  A
round goes by.  Bam, they find out the tonnage and configuration.

"What type of weapons do they have?" says the Captain.

"I\'m looking!"  the sensor tech replies.

What do you think, Bruce?

As what?  You can look at the neutrino signature all you want, but
nothing in it is going to say "pirate".  It will say "ship" and
give you general idea of how big, but that won\'t tell what his

Well, I don\'t think it\'s that certain, but it doesn\'t matter.  You
just don\'t hit the same system again.

Unless you just take a moment to change your ships signature.

    'body' => 'One thing to consider about GG\'s is even though there will be minimal
interstellar traffic to and from a GG, there  *can* be a large amount of
intrastellar traffic.

Why?

Because the hydrographic content of the main world is  *Nonrenewable*!  If
you send starship after starship full of precious water (or evenrefined
hydrogen) you are going to do great damage to the biosphere.

Now on low tech, and/or low pop. worlds with infrequent visits by starships,
and limited use of spaceships, this wouldn\'t be much of a problem as the
damage wouldn\'t show up for decades or centuries. (maybe even being so
gradual it is never really noticed.  one day you wake up as a 4 hydro. world
instead of a 5) So these worlds probably would never use their GG. (or
patrol? Why patrol something you never use. If someone is out there they
can\'t threaten the main world from there, so why bother? [read as
Isolationist or Financial conservative])

But the higher tech/pop worlds are going to have a greater amount of traffic
in both intra- and interstellar ships.  They are going to already be aware of
the dangers of major planetary refueling, or they may have already reached a
crisis point on the main world.  The solution to this is (drum roll...) *Gas
Giant Mining*!(is someone humming a _Midnight Oil_ song, or are the voices
back?)  This would create a lot of traffic to and from the GG.  Of course, if
there was an Ice loaded asteroid belt nearer than the GG then there would be
heavy traffic there instead.

So, IMHO, while there would be practicaly no Starships using most GG\'s.
(Exepting,of course, those few poor Far Trader\'s who barely have the next
port fees, let alone credits for fuel) But there could be large amounts of
local traffic using GG\'s.  Mostly in the larger worlds, but you might find
them on any worlds looking to their future.

"Significant" was intended to mean "enough that there was a decent
chance of finding ships", not "crowded shiping lane".  I\'m saying
that a pirate can pretend to be one of the boys in a shipping lane
with "significant" traffic before pouncing.  (Actually he could do
it in a crowded lane, but with all the people to see you "pouncing"
it probably isn\'t a good idea).

Orientation jets are actually pretty efficient and they don\'t use that
much fuel. Or you can have small thrust plates mounted instead of jets.
They\'d work the same way.

After all, you get *much* better leverage from small units working with
a big lever arm (ie well out from the center of mass) than you do with
a big unit practically on the centerline. Also, you get better
performance from "paired" steering units than from singletons.

A *lot* of people have never heard those terms. And I used to have

fish has a dorsal fin and that it\'s "vent" (asshole) is on the ventral

Look at it this way. In a civilized system, both Space Traffic Control
*and* the ships will be *actively* using sensors. Just like air traffic
control and airliners now.

In uncivilized systems or during wartime, only a fool *wouldn\'t* have
passive sensors running. Not only to look for pirates, but there\'s also
the possibility of space junk, or even another trader. And a collision
could ruin your whole day.

Best way is to have copies of the players character sheets, so you can
look up what their stats are without asking them. Then you have the
appropriate person roll a die or dice. Don\'t tell them what it\'s for.
If you make a habit of asking for "mystery rolls" every so often,
whether you need them or not, they won\'t know that it\'s anything
special.

There are several problems with this. They\'ll bump into each other,
they won\'t have even the pretense of privacy that a bunk with a curtain
gives. And finally, given the tight quarters, just think of the mess if
someone pukes, or excretes before getting to the sanitary arrangements.
That just about guarantees casualties. Inhaling that sort of thing is
*not* good for you.

Nope. The slave ships packed them as closely as they\'d fit. High tech
won\'t help.

That\'s essentially the way the slavers packed them. They\'d pull them
out of the "decks (18 inches tall!) one deck at a time to hose them
off, and feed them some gruel. Meanwhile they\'d hose out the deck a bit.
Then back they went.

Sure, with the 1.2 g drive you could climb out of earth\'s gravity well.
You\'d be effectively accelerating at .2 g.

But note that your thrust *exceeds* gravity. The original post seemed
to be about getting away from planets with drives that are *weaker*
than local gravity.

Escape velocity is the inverse of potential energy. It\'s the velocity
you\'d have at that altitude if you\'d fallen under the influence of
gravity from an infinite distance. Likewise, it\'s the velocity that you
need to reach an "infinite" distance. Anything less, and you\'d
eventually fall back.

With CG, you *still* have to worry about this. If the CG goes off, you
fall like a rock. So you\'d need to be moving *away* from the planet
pretty fast if you don\'t want to hit it.

Also, CG drops off as you get away from the planet. So if you use
*just* CG, it can only lift you so far. Then you\'d just sit there. 
Think of it as being like "floating" in water. Unless you build up a
lot of upward velocity, you won\'t get very far out of the water before
you fall back.

Another thing escape velocity is good for is figuring how "big" a
planet\'s gravity well is. Jupiter may have a "surface" gravity of only
2.6 g, but its gravity reaches *way* out there. the "surface" gravity
is so low only because Jupiter is *big* (large radius).

As an example, one of Jupiter\'s moons is at the same distance as
Earth\'s moon. Our moon takes about 29 days to make an orbit. The Jovian
one takes about 2.9 days. That means that the gravitational effects are
*ten* times as great as at the equivalent distance from Earth.

I was first exposed to this "trick" in a film that showed North
Vietnamese villagers "recycling" downed American aircraft. The troops
running the AA batteries would down a plane, the villagers would tell
them where the wreck was, and technicians would be sent out to strip
anything of interest, and dispose of the ordinance. Then the villagers
got to keep what was left. They\'d hack it into pieces, melt them down
and cast things out the aluminum. 

BTW, melting aluminum doesn\'t take all that hot a fire. Lead melts
easier, but brass and copper take higher temps. Iron takes *much*
higher temps.

But seriously, this does point out just how complex "tech level" is.
And it also suggests some trading possibilities that might otherwise
get overlooked.

A lot of "high tech" materials can be used, or even "worked" with much
lower tech. So I can see aluminum and even zinc (which is hard to smelt
unless you know the trick) being sold to lower tech planets. Oh yeah,
there\'s a "bronze" that\'s an aluminum/copper alloy. I\'m not sure that
it can be *made* at low tech levels, but it should be quite usable once
created.

ps. a nasty trick I learned from a jeweler friend backwhen I played
D&D. There are some rather interesting alloys out there. Want a
*purple* metal? How about a *red* one (not "orange" like copper, but
*red*). Also green and brown are available. These aren\'t coatings. If
you slice a chunk of the stuff in half, the color is there on the cut
surface. 

Great way to make players think they have something "new".

Well, here\'s a posting from rec.arts.sf.science that has an interesting
idea. Anybody here able to figure out the ISP of this thing?

Newsgroups: rec.arts.sf.science
Subject: "Fizzer" rockets
Date: 23 Sep 1997 00:26:29 GMT
Organization: the Praeternatural Tower

In some of my old (pre-1969) notes, I ran across a reference
to one of the silliest methods of rocket propulsion I have
ever seen.  Get a load of this:


  Take a long rod of fissionable material ( plutonium will do nicely ).
Shape it so it is almost at critical mass.  Before it explodes,
clad it in a neutron poison material ( cadmium or something like
that ).  Now imbed this like a pencil led in a wooden pencil
inside a cylinder of some solid material that will serve as
reaction mass.

  Place on the launch pad.  Put the payload on top.  Get into
a deep, dark, radiation shielded hole, and yank off the
bottom segment of cadmium.

  The rocket goes skyward like a radioactive sparkler from hell.
As the unclad segment of plutonium vaporizes itself (and the
surrounding reaction mass), it also vaporizes the adjacent
segment of cadmium, thus freeing the next segment of plutonium
to start reacting.

  Adds new life to the old adage about rockets being
"disintegrating totem poles".

 What sort of drugs were these rocket scientists thinking
when they dreamed up this sort of thing?  With all the
whoopla over the alledged dangers of the few miserable
pounds of plutonium in the Cassini probe, just imagine
the protest over the fizzer.  At least the Cassini is
designed to *contain* it\'s plutonium.

Sorry for overusing the word "silly" when it might just as well be applied
to me. Why do you divide the visible (reflected) by two for Lidar?
Lidar drops off as 1/r^4 and should simply use

sensitivity + reflectedsig - 2 * rangefactor

Just like radars but with visible reflected instead (right?)

  For what it\'s worth, "Imperium" gives the Vilani 1 RU per friendly
world, while the Terrans get 6 RU for any Vilani worlds that happen
to switch sides (rare, but covered in the rules). Obviously the scale
for such happenings increases drastically once the Terrans break out
from Dingir sub-sector. OC, the rules don\'t cover that period.

Hmm.  This is how it was before, in CT and MT, but I don\'t see it

I like it better that BattleDress is a special skill.  Maybe I\'ll change
this in my campaign.

As timelags are in seconds and gameturns are about 30 minutes these rules
albeit neat seem quite unrealistic. Suggestion:
Passives: Sensitivity + Signature - Rangefactor = Signal
Actives: Sensitivity + Signature - 2*Rangefactor = Signal
Signal -1 or less: No indication or anything
Signal 0-1: Position and signature but not vector.
Signal 2-3: Position, signature and vector. Minimum for firing at the target.
Signal 4+: Position, signature, vector and identity of target.
Sensor op: Spec succ. Sensitivity + 2
Sensor op: Succ. Sensitivity + 1
Sensor op: Fail. No effect on sensitivity
Sensor op: Spec fail. Sensitivity - 1

Active sensors threat Signal 0-1 as 2-3 ie they always get vector and thus
a firing solution.

Sensors on auto treat sensitivity as is (ie the same as a failed sensor op
roll) but pewrhaps modify Sensitivity with - 1 for scanning the entire sky.

Yes, but detecting the ship is enough, because the ship will be doing one
of three things in addition to just being there:

1) Broadcasting its true transponder code
2) Broadcasting a fake transponder code
3) Not broadcasting at all

In the first case it is hardly going to perform any acts of piracy. In the
second case it will not be able to do legitimate business in the system,
and may easily arouse suspicion (any naval commander will have a ship
registration list). In the third case it is in violation of regulations
and will be chased right away.

Yes, but that\'s battle damage repair and extraordinary refits. Maintenance
of ships is acomplished just by paying for it, so if routine ship maintenance
requires shipyard capacity, then it must be there in addition. Likewise
replacement of worn-out ships are implicit rather than explicit (If you
ran a TCS campaign for 100 years without fighting anybody you\'d still have
a fleet equivalent to your original one, without ever having paid for or
ordered new construction (And, yes, I realize that no one would ever do
so, but that\'s the way the rules have it.)).

It\'s implied in the fact that all the capacity is available for your use
with no rules for smashing your planetary economy to smithereens if you
suddenly decide to use it all.

Try looking at it the other way. If you have shipyards doing about 1 T of
naval maintenance and replacement per 1000 people and other shipyards doing
1 or 2 T of civilian maintenance and repair, then it becomes more plausible
that you can expand your business by 50% or perhaps only 33% literally
overnight. In other words, the worlds dosen\'t have empty shipyards and
idle workers lying around waiting for a new ship to be laid down or
a shot-up one coming in for repairs. They have so-and-so much regular
business and that implies the capability of temporarily expanding by
so-and-so much and then cutting back again afterwards.

I agree in principle, but it won\'t be 8 times larger if you are building
ships larger than Gazelles. (Btw. the whole business of expressing yard
capacity in displacement tons seem inexact. I\'m going to look into
converting it to RUs as per _Pocket Empires_).

Sigh! I\'m still not sure if you agree that the navy budgets canonically used
by Traveller governments will purchase enough assets to deal effectively
with pirates and you are claiming that the Imperium just wouldn\'t use those
assets even though they have them, or whether you think that Traveller
governments don\'t spend enough money to have enough assets to deal with
pirates. The example you quote above, and practically every historical
example that I know of where a government allowed piracy or brigandage
came as a result of not having the assets to deal with them. Likewise I
can\'t think of any historical example where a government had the ability
to deal with piracy and chose not to do it (Well, I shall have to qualify
that; there are examples of governments shielding pirates that didn\'t
attack their shipping, but that wouldn\'t apply to pirates inside the
Imperium, now would it?).

I can think of several example of governments, having suffered from piracy
for some time, got fed up and scraped together the assets to eradicate
them. But having enough ships to deal with them and chosing not to use
them? Can\'t think of a single example.

Of course not regardless of cost. You seem to be reading what I write through
distorting spectacles. I\'ve already said this several times and you have
failed to refute it: Since the Imperium pays for the ships anyway there\'s is 
no extra cost involved in dealing with pirates.

You\'re right. Further discussion is futile and in the future I will just
restrict myself to pointing out that you are wrong whenever you reiterate
your unsupported claims.

If anybody _else_ still disagrees with me, I\'ll be pleased to continue the
discussion.

>We already covered pirates operating out of bases vs pirates

Right. I\'ve demonstrated that both types would be unable to make a living
in the face of the difficulties they would be up against.

So what? Neither operation costs the ship any money, except the purifier
plant indirectly, since it  reduces the cargo space of the ship.

Sometimes, yes, but at other times you will miss the cargo that you would
have gotten if you had been available to take it immidiately. There\'s no
that requires you to sit on the tarmac for your full six days if you
happen to get a cargo on your first day. And the point is that you can\'t
know that when you aim for the Gas Giant.

Why not? I wouldn\'t trust my numbers ;-) I\'ve just gone over my calculations

Who would use Low Passage if it had a 17% chance of death even if there were
no alternative? IMTU I use the rules that makes Low Passage safe as long as
there is a qualified medic to supervise the thawing.

	But why would one want to move them?  Can you imagine the sheer

So, if I go and buy a new ship and get to a system before my registration

Any naval commander will have a ship registration list (which, of course

In backwater worlds (off the Xboat courier routes) I can easily see a new

could be someone else\'s stolen code, or a ship\'s that the pirate destroyed

Well, one might argue that it would take a long time to seriously
deplete the amount of water on a planet like Earth. But that
aside, inhabited, "garden-world" planets like Earth will have a
total ban on ocean/lake refueling for one simple reason.

Contamination.

The ship "Naughty Boy" lands on World A, fills fuel tanks with
water. Jumps to World B. "Naughty Boy" drops into a local ocean,
dumps its tanks and refuels. Except - guess what hitched a ride in 
the fuel tank? Any number of little critters that could run wild and
cause some serious havoc on the ocean ecology. Oops.

Things like this happen with alarming frequency today even, with
Zebra mussels being a rather good case-in-point. An aunt & uncle
of mine own a boat on the 1000 Islands/St. Lawrence Seaway and I
distinctly remember the water at their marina being thick, murky
and quite green when I was a kid. A few years ago when I went
back, the water was crystal clear. Zebra mussels had gotten into the
area and filtered every last molecule of organic matter out of the
water as they bred like mad. While this sounds nice (woah, instant
clean water) the mussels had a tendency to grow inside pipes which
terminated in open water, often clogging municipal water intakes or
sewage overflow pipes. Unpleasant to say the least.

I think ships may refuel based on local water supplies, depending 
on the availability of water, but they won\'t be plunking down and
just sucking it up if they know what\'s good for them.

Well, look carefully and you\'ll find that there aren\'t alot of stormtroopers
actually \'running\' in the desert.  They are basically walking on a desert
like backlot, or standing and mulling around in the desert for 5 seconds or
so.

A friend of mine lived in Florida all of his life before moving up here to
Philadelphia.  He lived in the Orlando area, so, as teenagers, everybody had
jobs at Disney World.  One of the jobs you could get was wearing the suits of
the various characters.  It was very common for people in these suits to
faint.  It was most common in the Jiminy Cricket suit, because alot of it was
hard plastic, it was terribly uncomfortable as well as hot (and for some
reason as my friend tells it, it actually got hotter than the rest of the
suits).

In response to his many critics, Michael Drosnin (the author of the
_Bible Code_) said in the June 9, 1997 issue of _Newsweek_ "When my
critics find a message about the assassination of a prime minister
encrypted in _Moby Dick_, I\'ll believe them."

A group of linguists in Australia, using the same methods as Drosnin,
have done just that. They have found passages detailing the
assassinations of Indira Ghandi,Leon Trotsky, Martin Luther King, John
F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, Yitzak Rabin, and the crash of Princess Di.
Does this mean that the collection of words that makes up _Moby Dick_ is
prophetic or divine in nature? Of course not. It means that any
sufficiently large collection of words can be manipulated by
pseudoscientific means. Something that is even easier to do in Hebrew
than English because of the flexibility of the vowels in Hebrew.

They have a webpage at HTTP://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/moby.html
describing these findings. It has not yet been reported whether or not
Drosnin has kept his promise and retracted the "discoveries" of his
money-making enterprise. I suspect that he is making too much money in
the millenial-induced spiritual unease in society today.

Kenneth, please do not take this as a personal attack. I too found the
book to be fascinating, in a sleight-of-hand sort of way. I just get
annoyed by the half-truths and deception I found in his work.

there security robots that cannot miss at say 50 m or less with lasers? If
we could only make some software that could decide who are enemies and who

missed a human target within say 50 m.

Although I don\'t have the books around to check it out, I\'ve always
thought that Battledress skill can be used at -1 for Vac Suit skill, but
*not* the other way around.

In the same way, Pilot skill (-1) counts as Ship\'s Boat skill, but not
the reverse.

So, if I have Pilot-3, I can use Ship\'s Boat-2. If I\'ve got Ship\'s Boat,
I can\'t drive the big ships. If I\'ve got Vac Suit-5, that\'s not enough
to use Battledress.

I might be mistaken in the reading of the rules, but in any case, that\'s
the way I\'ve always played it...

One *might* rule that any level of Vac Suit is good for basic
Battledress-0, and the same for Ship\'s Boat/Pilot skill.

This is true in a sense, but what happens if your CG fails?

If CG nullifies gravity completely, then what just happened to the
potential energy?  I have not worked out the power needs yet, but I suspect
that CG is a free energy machine.  Consider - I could use CG to make a
heavy object have no weight, lift it up a ways, and then turn the CG off.
Would I get more out than I put in?

As a result, if you have a way of turning off most or all of the gravity,
then you have reduced the escape velocity, assuming it works by reducing
the gravitational potential.

You might be happier phrasing that as "escape velocity is the velocity you
would need to have at the surface to reach infinite distance from that
gravitational field."

It is quite true that you can almost certainly pounce on someone once, with
complete surprise.

Where life gets interesting is when you want to do it again.

Were I traffic control, I would be tremendously motivated to know
signatures on every ship in the system for just this reason.  It might be
true that I cannot get all of them, but I bet a minimal expense could get
every ship near something important, and once it knew a ship was present,
it could track it through the system with very little chance of loosing the
trail.

If traffic control knows who you are, and you then commit an act of piracy,
then they can tell anyone else out there who you are.  They will be
suspicious in general, because of your transponder readings, which better
be false.  They also might be very interested in knowing what you are up to
if they see a complete lack of transponder readings.

So, this means that the pirate looking for a target of opportunity must 1)
not be seen, and must 2) stay unidentified even after the action.

Once a raid happens, traffic control is going to find out.  Likely
immediately, unless they have a hijacker on board to silence the radios.

If the attack happens within a hundred diameters, it is a few hours to
combat range at the absolute worst, and likely significantly less.

Even if it happens outside a hundred diameters, which the current rules do
not really encourage, traffic control will look in the sensor records to
see if they can spot the combatants.  If nothing else, the ships going on
S&R will want to know if they are going to be attacked.

Systems do talk, at least if they are wise, and it is not in the Imperial
interest for piracy to happen.  While you might argue that they would not
do anything to prevent it, and thus provoke acts of war outside the
Imperium, and rebellion inside it, it is not unreasonable to assume that
they are going to at least keep decent ship registry records and likely
offer sensor arrays cheaply, so that the planet can get a record of who is
doing what.  This lets outer planets acts as an early warning network.

It also allows the Imperium to know who is acting against their interests.

>Unless you just take a moment to change your ships signature.

Last time I talked to someone who knew sonar, it was very difficult to
change fundamental signature such that a modern day ocean ship was
unrecognizable.  This meant that a vessel being tracked by sonar would
usually stay the same, even through refits.  You might get surprise once or
twice, but it is quite nontrivial.  It might be instructive to find out how
much it would cost to change the signature of a vessel in the usual PEMS
bands.

Also, note that your signature must change regularly, as they can always
check records, so the signature you have when you do the illegal act better
be very different than the signature you had when they first spotted you,
and what they wrote down when you were last in port.  This would be the
equivalent of repainting your car every time you drove downtown, just on
the off chance that you could commit a robbery.  It is worth doing for a
planned objective, but not terribly cost effective for a target of
opportunity.

Again, the problem gets much different if you assume that ships can be
attacked in jump space.  I am considering moving to a hyper drive system
where ships can be attacked in hyper, but where many of the other Traveller
"facts" stay the same.  This opens up piracy, as then the Imperium could
not afford the number of ships needed to patrol.

        I suspect that a trip through the purification plant will substantially

        suspect that any ship which attempts to jump from World A with a fuel

I always roll all the dice, then drop the lowest ones, so the damage
applied would be as Eris states. If it doesn\'t double off, I let armour
take out the highest n rolls, and then discard the lower dice to make the
3D limit. Thus players get maximum armour protection and maximum damage...

Anders, if we were playing a *wargame* then I would agree with you, but
I believe Ken (and I know I am) playing contacts out in a *roleplaying* 
rather than a wargaming mode.  Turns in roleplaying mode shouldn\'t be 30
minutes long no matter what the wargame oriented rules might say! I\'m
using 1 minute turns for the roleplaying, yes I know the ship-combat
rules all seem to favor longer periods and if it comes to actually
shooting combat then I\'ll probably have to abstract the play into these
longer periods. However, for the parts leading up to combat and during
combat where the PC\'s are *actually* involved I want to keep the action
"fast and furious" and that means short slam-bang turns.

As I see it, what Ken wants is not only reasonable it is the heart of
realistic for roleplaying. So, it comes as no surprise when I echo his
question...

Bruce, let\'s say we\'re talking about 1 to 3 minute scans rather than 30
minute ones. What does that do to what we can pick up with our sensors?
How do the scans improve in increments of 1 to 3 minutes? How do the
different sensor types do with short scan times?  Is the range at which
we can get good data decreased, and then increases over time to the
ranges you posted? Is it a linear progression, log, quadratic? Is there
an effect on how much of the sky can be considered scanned?  Could you
*please* give us some guidance in how to use your rules if we are using
short turns?

        If you land on a world with life, exactly what do you want
        your sensors to tell you -- do you want to know if a chim-
        panzee jumps on top of the ship, if there\'s an orang utan
        passing by, or if there\'s a terrorist attaching a limpet mine?
        How sophisticated do your sensors have to be to discriminate
        between these events. What if the exotic biology of this planet
        has produced a melon-like fruit with a flesh similar (but not
        identical) to C4? If one falls on your ship, are you going to
        come roaring back across the planet to check out the situation?

        A few events of this nature could discourage overzealous sensor
        analysis. On the other hand, I can see some very frustrated PC\'s.
        This, of course, has its own charms.

I try to copy the players character sheets, or at least write down this kind
of material.

"Oh oh. The ref. just looked at the character sheets, and he rolled a few
dice. Worst of all, he smiled. What is going on around here?"

Most of the times I do this kind of stuff just to anoy the players. It keeps
them jaded, and when I do roll for something significant, they do not really
suspect it. In fact, they do not have a clue, as I didn\'t ask them anything.

No, but you would be pulled over post haste, and asked to provide
particulars.  I suspect this would include lists and pictures of crew
members, distinguishing marks about the vessel, and so on.

I have used this as an adventure hook - the players were undercover
sneakies, and had a new ship registry.  Imagine their delight and surprise
when the navy got full dossiers on them.  (Someone screwed up - they should
have been issued a known code for their class of ship, but the person
organizing it missed that detail.)

Face it, you just acted suspicious in the eyes of the commander, and are
going to face the consequences.  Of course, those consequences might be
"Ah, big deal.  Looks new, and not worth the effort,"  but the commander
might be a suspicious sort.

As recent as the ship registries need it to be.  I suspect a report of
piracy and murder gets red flagged to all the garrisons, while new ship
construction might lag a bit.

Yep.  And life gets interesting every time it happens.  Note that in those
backwater systems off the xboat links, the Navy is likely not going to be
as busy, and is going to be more concerned about pirates.

As long as it matches the hull paint their sensors get, and the data
matches the ship class, they care not.  If you screwed up the match, then
your life is very interesting.  I made some players quite excited when they
upgraded the ship and power plant with some serious military grade
weaponry, which changed the signature enough that the transponder did not
quite match, until they had it checked out at a Naval yard.  They did not
figure out for months why every Navy ship in system got very interested
when they showed up.

>  How would the Imperial Navy (or the local
>starport) know that Senior Captain "Law-Abiding" Mullenhoff is _in fact_
>Captain "Argh Matey!!!" Morgan, notorious pirate of the realm?

They do not, unless the captain has been identified.  They would know,
though, that the ship, which is a rather expensive toy, and one of a fairly
small number, was spotted by Zircon Traffic Control during the famed
"Administrator Rand" piracy and looting.  (NB, fairly small means thousands
per world, or millions across the Imperium.  This is not an unreasonable
amount to keep in Traffic Control\'s database.)

There is room in here for something to be missed.  Traffic control might
not have a good sensor tech, or might not keep the data long enough if the
piracy is concealed. or they might not be on the ball.  You might get a
Naval commander who does not bother spending the few microseconds of
computer time, or the few minutes of sensor time to check that your
signature and your transponder match.

My point, though, is that it is fairly easy to track down pirates, unless
they have some serious help, or they have the ability to operate
unobserved.  If the only match the Navy has is that Morgan is on a free
trader, they are going to have a hell of a time getting him.

Seems to me that the real trick is operating outside of visual range, and
the only way to do that is to break the "everyone is safe in jump" rule
somehow.  I do not yet know if I want to do that, but I am considering.
Eris, you were using a stutterwarp concept to solve this - how does it work?

The 14 cubic meters probably include some kind of recreation facility,
something like a TV (movie showing machine). In addition, the person within
can probably store some luggage within the cabin, like a few books, a small
computer for work and recreation etc.

Are you talking about slave ships here? You could fit people in on as little
as about two cubic meters (which would be a space akin to a coffin). You
would need to feed these \'passengers\' through a small hatch or something.

Another thing that takes up space is access tunnels to these lodgings. This
space is not at all insignificant. I would say about four or five people
could fit inside these 14 cubic meters.

You would need to add some kind of recreational hall. This would need to be
a fixed size regardless of the number of passengers, as not every passenger
is going to use it at the same time anyway.

I think this kind of extra equipment will be available ... for a price. It
would not need to be standard equipment, as not every ship would want (or
want to pay for) it, but the captains who fear burglars would be able to buy
it. If there is a demand, there is always a product (rule number one of a
capitalist society, which, after all, is what Traveller is).

	it allowed point 2 (the central government) to fall, because
	the aztec empire never thought about a "real" war, they have
	ritualisised their war with the same effect : Population control
	by femicide.

>    I do not understand how your reference to femicide pertains to either

	Did\'nt we have femicide discussion some weeks ago ?

	The main reason of war is population control, but as males
	fight wars and get killed, it seams that war is not effective
	for poplation control because woman will get the babies, until
	combined with femicide.

	Ok lets explain what femicide is, and where it came from.

	On Tl-0, where a woman has one child per time, because the
	child is on mamas arm all the time, drinking milk all the
	time, no need for population control arise and woman have
	a high value for the tribe.

	When Tl-1 is reached a woman can have more kids (one per
	year) the number of kids per woman is only limited by
	argricultural production.  History showed several cultures
	expanding fast when the reached Tl1 (last one where Iroquese)
	having a woman driven society, with argiculture and small cities.

	The value of women in this early Tl1 is extremly high, because
	their agricultural production is much higher than the hunting
	expeditions of the men.  The man are switching to extended war
	expeditions (the Iroquese where know down to Pueblo), to improve
	their value.  Next step (in Iroquese terms) are Squaws, stolen
	women, slaves outside tribal right, brought back to home after
	an war expedition. The French meet the Iroquese at this stage.

	These woman driven economies did never last for long (Humans
	are not Aslan - Aslan have no need to rape woman, as there
	are allways enough when the expedition was successfull ;-)
	Gilgamesh Epos, Guenevre, Rape of Jakobin, Greek Amazon.
	History shows a lot of examples of what happend next. 

	A tribe which is doing femicide will have a miliary advantage
	next generation, because women can be stolen, and there is no
	need to feed own woman. The higher the pressure the higher the
	value of man over women the more likely. The Vikings are a good
	example of such a warrior tribe.

	The Aztecs are interesting in this line, because they made a
	ritual around war. The war itself was unbloody, and goal was
	not to conquer/murder/rape but only to bring warriors of the
	other party to the own temple to eat them. Unlike europeans,
	africans or asians they did\'nt had something like cows. Only
	dogs and birds, nobles toythings. So the anual war event,
	where any male was expected to join several times, was a
	ritual to remember the "good old times" when there was
	something to hunt for meat. This sports event like war,
	also increased the value of man over woman, like a real war
	does, so femicide was posible for population control. 

	Even if there are "better" types of poplation control posible
	at Tl6+, femicide is still the most comon one, because the
	value of man over women based on war tradition is still high.

It is my understanding that the Stormtrooper armor is environmentally

I\'m sure those stormtroopers on Tatooine were experiencing a cool 72
degrees.

I\'ve been contemplating this in my game too.  It seems to me that even
the airlocks, with no alarm or antihijack program, is sufficient to keep
most people out--like locking your door to your house before you leave.

Except, the door to a spaceship is like locking a safe.  The hull is
made out of superdense, so it\'s going to take a decent sized apparatus
to cut through it.  (I need to check out that entry cutter listed in the
CSC and see what that can do.)

I think it would be a major operation to break into a starship.  It
would definitely attract on lookers in the starport.

Sombody could also try to pick the lock and have the door open--but
again, you could use the rules in the CSC to this.

This brings us to a related question.  How easy is it for your
characters to space walk to a ship they\'ve found, dead in space, and
open it from the outside?

Thougths anyone?

Well, rules aside, my interpretation is as follows.

If you have Vacc Suit skill, you can put on fully working, fitted, Battle
Dress and walk around it in minimal powered state fine. You can also, with
a roll, use the built in toilet.

If you want to tune battle dress not fitted to you (cf Cherryh\'s
RimRunners), perform minor maintenance and repair, fire integral or linked
weapons, use augmented power, run, stiff-brace for impact, coordinate
battle telemetry, active scan, link to heads up display, or empty the built
in toilet, you need the Battle Dress skill.

In other words, if you want to use any of the features that makes Battle
Dress any different from a Vacc Suit, you need the skill.

The cost of training was only a secondary point in my argument. Even if you
discount it, the cost of the battle dress still buys a lot of conventional
stuff.

I would say let their ship send a distress signal if anyone was breaking
in, it does not guarantee that his communicator is going to receive the
signal.  If I were going to break into a ship knowing this was common
practice I would use a signal jammer to block the signal until I was
inside and could dissable the transmitter, or get far enough away.

Just remember any intrusion countermeasure will probably have a counter
counter measure developed 1 or 2 TL\'s later...

Drosnin covers this topic in his book.  It is written in a very secular
style--the guy\'s a skeptic himself, but it is hard to ignore the proof
he has.

The author and Rips, the Israli mathematician who discovered the Bible
Code, tested other "large collections of words", like the Hebrew editon
of War and Peace, and they too found things about JFK, Ab Lincoln,
Rabin, and the others you cite.

This did not surprise them.  My name is Kenneth, and it is logical that
you can find my name in just about any book you pick up if you skip
enough letters.

What is facinating about the Bible code is that they have found NO OTHER
BOOK to conatin the detail that the Bible contains.

A year before the Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, was
assinated, they found his name in the Bible.  Now, this isn\'t that
unusual--except that all of the detail that occurred in the same section
that his name was found.

Not only did they find his name, they found "assassin that will
assassinate" crossing through his name.  They found "name of assassin",
then a space, then "Amir" right above his name.  They found "Rabin
assassinatin", then a space, then "in 5756" next to his name.  They
found "Tel Aviv" next to his name.

Guess what.  5756, in the Hebrew callender, corresponds to the standard
year beginning in September 1995, ending in September 1996.

Yitzyak Rabin was assassinated on November 4th, 1995, in Tel Aviv, by
Yigal Amir--an assassin that said "God told me to do it."

Find that kind of detail in Moby Dick.

They\'ve had the top mathematicians in the world look at this thing,
people from MIT, Harvard, Israli Mathematicians, and even a code breaker
from the National Security Agency in the US.  All of them have said that
the math in the Bible Code is sound, nobody has been able to find this
type of accurate information in any other book, and they are all stumped
because they know that the Bible was written 3,000 years ago.

If this Rabin thing was the only thing in the Bible Code, then it would
be one thing, but they continue to find more and more things.

Six months before Clinton was eleted, they typed in his name.  They
found it, and the word "president" crossed it.  

Three days before the Gulf War, they typed in Hussein.  They found it,
"Hussein picked a day".  Clost to that were the words "Saddam", "Enemy",
"War", "Missile", and "January 18, 1991."

Guess what, again.  The date that Hussein fired the first scud was
January 18, 1991, starting the Gulf War.

Find that in Mobey Dick.

They typed in Watergate, and they found it right next to "Who is he? 
President, but he was kicked out."

They typed in Economic Collapse, and they found "The Depression",
"1929", and "stocks" right next to it.

They typed in Man on the Moon, and crossing it was "spaceship".

They typed in the name of that comet that hit Jupiter back in \'94,
Shoemaker-Levy.  Crossing it, they found "will pound Jupiter", and next
to it they found "July 16, 1994".

Yep, you guessed it.  Comet Shoemaker-Levy hit Jupiter on that exact
date, "July 16, 1994."

Hitler is always a good one.  They typed it in.  Next to it, they found
"Evil Man", "Nazi and Enemy", and "Slaughter" next to it. 

They searched for Shakespeare, and when they found it, next to it was
"presented on stage", "Macbeth", and "Hamlet".

They looked for Wright Brothers.  They found "airplane" next to it.

They typed in Edison.  Right next to it was "electricity" and "light
bulb".

Crossing the name Newton is "gravity".

Typing in Einstein, you get a jig saw puzzle of "Science", "he
overturned present reality", "they prophesied a brainy person", and "a
new and excellent understanding".

This is too much to be just pure coinincidence!  They fact that they
have not been able to locate this information with this type of detail
in any other source is amazing.

The book states that most mathematicians agree that if you find a
result, with the odds that the result will occur being 1 in 1000, then
it is not chance.

The Bible Code was held to this standard before it was published in
Statistical Science, a leading academic magazine.

The editors of Statitical Science require two independent studies to be
performed before they\'ll print anything.  The Bible Code had three, and
the odds for accuracy in the Code were calculated to 1 in 10
million--not 1 in 1000.

Incredible.  The paper was published in the August 1994 edition.

I\'m telling you, this is no Mobey Dick.

Not in CT and MT.  If you read the skill in those editions, Vac Suit can
be used, as is, for BattleDress.

BattleDress, on the other hand, can be used as Vac Suit at one level
below your BDress skill.

T4 does not mention this either way.

Not according to CT and MT.  You can use Vac Suit interchangeably with
BattleDress.  I\'m looking at the Traveller Book and MT Player\'s Manual
right now.

I like BattleDress being the other way around.  I like BattleDress being
this hard skill to get and learn.  Maybe T4 will make it that way.

I\'d be interested to see how BattleDress and Vac Suit skills will read
in T4.1.

Why would someone want to break into a ship?

a. to steal it.
b. to steal what\'s inside.
c. to damage/sabotage it.
d. to stow away.


I imagine civilized starports would have enough of a guard that anyone who took
a _long_ time doing the above would be noticed.  So, for most ships a (really
good) lock on the door might acutally suffice to stop (a), (b), and (d).  (c)
could be accomplished by a limpet mine - how do you expect that to be found?
Inspect the ship before takeoff, perhaps.

Many sci-fi books use computer access codes to lock down a ship - without the
codes you can\'t steal it, because the computer won\'t fire the engines.  The
access codes are one of the things which signify you _own_ the ship, and keep
mutiny from happening.


In uncivilized parts, if they value their trade the\'ll have guards with the
equivalent of AK-47s (my parents were on a dig in Turkey which was a major
source of income for the town, and at one point the villagers started pulling
out AK-47s and patrolling nearby.) to keep people from messing with your ship.


If they don\'t value the trade, what are you doing there?  Well, you should have
a better security system.  But the PCs should realize that _any_ security
system can be circumvented.  Guards can be overpowered, computers can be
hacked, motion detectors can be fooled, computers won\'t recognize that alien as
a human, nobody\'s going to see the guy with the antitank missile taking aim
from outside your perimeter.  Let\'s dig a tunnel which goes under the whole
sensor net, come up under the ship, and work from there.  Make sure the alarm
is set off every couple minutes by "natural" sources until the owners get
annoyed and turn it off.  Sci-fi is filled with low-tech people getting around
compelx high-tech stuff by being creative.



Park the spaceship in a sheltered area.  Mount a few motion detectors.  Rig it
to a comm alarm.  If your comms have video capability, add cameras and look at
whatever sets off the alarm.

If you have an advanced computer, have _it_ monitor the cameras for people.

Put a big sign on the door saying "Warning: automated lethal security system."
Who cares if you have the system, people don\'t really want to die.  They\'ll
pick another ship.

It won\'t be perfect, but you\'ll raise the difficulty to the point where, in
general, people won\'t even try.



But it\'s a game.  I expect that there\'ll be an understanding between me and my
players that as long as they take reasonable precautions, if I do something
like "steal the ship" there will be a chance to get it back.  In return, there
will be interesting plot hooks from when someone sneaks on board, or sabotages
this critical piece of machinery which requires the PCs to fix it, or stashes
cocaine in the landing gear, or or or....

Well, depending on how tough you assume fuel purifiers are, running
little critters through the purifiers may have a pretty nasty effect
on the purifiers!

At any rate, ships might take on water for any number of reasons 
and it might not all get converted to LHyd. e.g. drinking/bathing
water, reaction mass, ballast, whatever. Heck, who says you
have to turn it into LHyd? If I\'m not mistaken, purifiers turn
unrefined fuel into refined fuel. However, the rules do say that 
you can run on "pure unrefined" fuel, with an additional chance
of misjump (CT I think). So I think that eventually some critters
would get from World A to World B unless they were both pretty
fussy about where they let ships land and refuel.

They only had to bring a few rabbits into Australia and pretty
soon... *BOOM*. (If you\'ve never seen the pictures, at one point
the rabbits were so thick that they completely covered the 
ground like a thick blanket of vegetation.) The miracles of
unchecked exponential growth.

Funnily enough, I feel this supports my argument ... the loss of military 
building during peaceful times will only need a 12.5% increase in civilian 
building.  During the war, the priorities shift and you can quickly build up 
your naval fleet at the expense of reduced new merchant building (and zero 
yacht building :-).

Again, I disagree.  Based on the calculations in my earlier message, each 
year of lost production will only deprive the merchant fleet of its regular 
2% replacement ... hardly smithereen-causing.  If mercahnt losses are high 
due to war, I suspect that few people will complain about increased Naval 
building!

I know that big ships like the Tigress take a long time to build (3.2 years, 
allowing for the 40% productivity bonus for standard designs - slightly 
longer if we use the 41 months given in Fighting Ships).  

Let us consider a 1,000,000 T yard, 50% spent on building a Tigress and 50% 
spent on building 200 T traders (both are standard designs and get a 40% 
productivity bonus).  After 3.2 + 0.5 years I will have:
1 Tigress (500,000 T) = 3.2 years
300 FH (15,000 T) = 0.5 years
14,000 Traders (2,800,000 T)

This is still a ratio of 5.4 x the tonnage of traders (and, at 14,000:301 
ship ratio the opportunities for piracy .... oops, nearly slipped again).

I could claim that the 19 Naval Depots mentioned in Rebellion (for 
MegaTraveller) are the source of repairs; or I could claim that ordinary 
starport space (not construction yard space) is all that is needed.  When 
was the last time your car was serviced by the original factory?  Naval 
Depots are the "repair shops" for the naval fleet; repair shops for "normal" 
people are much more common - A and B ports.


I did not start out with a fixed idea of the "right" model of Traveller ship 
building, but having now presented my analysis of seaship building and seen 
the merchant fleet / naval fleet size ratio and so on, I have persuaded 
myself that my interpretation (1 T per 1000 pop is total ship yard capacity) 
is reasonable.  I find it difficult, despite your excellent arguments, that 
a stable economy needs (or would choose to pay for) 1 T per 1000 pop just 
for Naval use.

I think that this depends on whether the ship is departing a moderate
tech or above world.  After all these worlds could (should) easily have
total sensor coverage and would warn any ships about all other ships
that may be approaching - Much like air traffic control might.

However - In the frontier it might pay players to keep a very close eye
on their near space environment.  This could be a valuable learning
experience for them.

Did the dead ones get put back, or thrown overboard?

Which is my way of introducing another point - there was a certain 
level of "acceptable loss" for the "cargo", based purely on economic 
factors.  I believe the original poster was talking about bedsores 
being possibly acceptible - you are going to end up with a lot worse 
than that if you pack them in like the slave ships.  I think this 
would be true (though somewhat less extreme) even at TL12.

I\'m claiming that those Navy budgets are aleady being used to
purchase ships that will be deployed to fight a war and if you
want to stop pirates you need ships that are deployed differently,
either by giving up their military mission or by buying new
ships.

Hans, this really is the third or fourth time I\'ve said this.
All we are doing is rehashing points that we have covered
several times already.  Bringing it up all again won\'t
change our postions.

>The example you quote above, and practically every historical
>example that I know of where a government allowed piracy or brigandage
>came as a result of not having the assets to deal with them.

I already indicated that I don\'t agree.  From piracy that exists
in modern Asian waters, to piracy that existed and preyed upon
English, Roman, and Chinese empires, this is not true.  Every
society has had crime that it has tolerated because the costs
of eradication are too high.  But clearly we disagree on this
and going over it again isn\'t going to change that.

>(Well, I shall have to qualify
>that; there are examples of governments shielding pirates that didn\'t

Well, it would.  Can you say Vargr?  In any case, piracy does
exist without the shield of hostile governments.

>I can think of several example of governments, having suffered from piracy
>for some time, got fed up and scraped together the assets to eradicate
>them.

Sure, I\'ll just concede that there are _some_ cases.  But if you
want to say that piracy _can\'t_ exist in the Imperium you have
to say that _all_ governments are unwilling to tolerate piracy
at any level of activity.  But, in fact, almost every sea
power has tolerated piracy when the costs of stamping it
out were less than the cost of the piracy.

>But having enough ships to deal with them and chosing not to use
>them? Can\'t think of a single example.

They are in use, on military missions.  And just as those historical
empires didn\'t want to pay the cost of pulling ships away from
military missions to stamp out piracy, so the Imperium probably
wouldn\'t.

>Of course not regardless of cost. You seem to be reading what I write through
>distorting spectacles

OK, in ever threa. I\'ve already said this several times and you have
>failed to refute it: Since the Imperium pays for the ships anyway there\'s is
>no extra cost involved in dealing with pirates.

I\'m sorry, I have.  I have explained that those ships are deployed
for _military_ purposes and that deployment is incompatible with
piracy deployment (one needs forces concentrated to stop large
fleets intent on seizing planets and that other needs a thin
covering everywhere).  I have done this multiple times in direct
answer to the assertion that those ships "are there anyway".
You have always tried to counter with the idea that it will
only take a small number of ships.  I don\'t agree that it
will take as few ships as you say (and no, I\'m not going to
go over that all _yet again_) and, in any case, that doesn\'t
make the ships "free".  The cost of those ships needs to be
justified on what they are going to do.  They are not free.

When the thead gets to a point where points are being repeated
and one starts getting meassages that essentially claim that you
narrow minded, it is my experience that this is a sure sign that
the thread is dead.

>You\'re right. Further discussion is futile and in the future I will just
>restrict myself to pointing out that you are wrong whenever you reiterate
>your unsupported claims.

That\'s good.  But sticking "your unsupported claims" in
there is inconsitent with you claim of taking the high
ground.  What do you expect one to do?  Either agree that
one\'s points are unsupported or be goaded into posting
more in support?  This isn\'t a way to wrap up a thread
(at least no amicably).

I would suggest that the best way out is to ackowledge that
we _each_ find the other\'s position unsupported and must
agree to disagree.  I also assume this doesn\'t mean
that you expect that, when discussing things with other
people, you will jump in and explain how wrong I am while
I leave your messages alone, or without reviving the thread,
or whatever.  That isn\'t letting the thread die.  That is
expecting the other person to surrender.

You "purifier" plant does both.  The problem is that it should
take more space, power, and time to split water and seperate
hydrogen than it takes to just seperate hydrogen.

But something doesn\'t have to be a sure thing be to worthwhile.
So, if you are having trouble getting cargo quickly, or you
are entering a planet where you experience delays before, you make a
judgement.  If the odds that the only cargo you can will be
able to get can\'t possbily wait a few days (unlikely unless
you are in busy system, but then there will be other cargos),
times the cost of  that cargo, are compensated by the savings
then it might well be worth it.

   I will concede this point for the sake of discussion, but I don\'t
   believe it.  IMHO, the `reasons\' for war are avarice, fear, and
   revenge, but I am familiar with the war-as-reproductive-strategy
   theory.  Note, however, that paradoxically war usually results in a
   long-term population boom (as does famine and plague).

   Last I checked, the definition of femicide is the systematic murder of
   females preferentially to males.  While women do die in war, they do
   not die in larger numbers than do males.  (In fact the reverse is
   usually true.  Viricide?)  The killing (or eating) of males and the
   rape or kidnapping of females do not constitute femicide.  I have never
   heard of femicide in war, at TL1 or TL6+.  Today, femicide is practiced
   mostly in China, where poor parents prefer to have a son so they murder
   their daughters.
   
   What does this have to do with Traveller?  Well, I\'m not sure really.
   I\'ve never read allegations of femicide directed against the Vilani
   or Solomani, or anyone else in the Traveller universe for that matter.
   Perhaps future discussion should be taken off-line, unless you see a
   connection.

Which is why you don\'t do it again in the same system until
you have changed your ships signature.  In any cast, since
commercial ships use standard reactor design, all ships of
the same type will have the same neutrino signature (and
pirates use the same types of ships as an armed merchant
or they use things like the omnipresent Type S scout).

[Note: The poster\'s point is also based on the premise that
one can track a ship\'s neutrino signature all the way out
at the 100 diam jump limit.  I don\'t know if it is possible,
I\'ve seen other post in dispute, but I don\'t have time
to go into it myself so I will just assume it is possible
since it doesn\'t really matter.  In any case, this still
wouldn\'t cover places like the gas giants.]

>Systems do talk, at least if they are wise

Unfortunately, even if you could distinguish signatures, systems
can only trade news as fast a ship travel.  Fringe
systems are going to have to wait for a ship to take a message
and even in a busy system there are delays while you get mixed
in with all the other high priority messages, they figure out
what systems the message needs to go to, what ships are available,
and wait for those ships.  The fact is that, unless a certain
type of news is so high priority that it is worth spending
big bucks on ships in every system waiting to take just
those kinds of messages, then even important messages have
to wait on scheduled departures.  That means it is possible
to stay ahead of news.  (And a pirate only has to do it long
enough to just retune the reactor and change his signature).

>and it is not in the Imperial
>interest for piracy to happen.

OTOH, it is not in Imperial interest to spend more money
preventing piracy than the piracy itself would cost.

>  While you might argue that they would not
>do anything to prevent it

I certainly wouldn\'t.  There will be no piracy at Regina,
where there is a lot of traffic concentrated in one, relatively
easy to patrol area.  They will look at how much piracy a
certain amount of money will prevent and spend the appropriate
ammount.  What this means is that piracy will be generally a
low level activity that is, at most, a minor problem (and
probably only nusance) that occurs in fringe area.

It gives you the general type of ship, pirates us the same types
of ships that are being used for other purposes.

Um no, it would be the equivalent of repainting the car only after
you commit a robbery (which happens).  If you commit a crime
you just have to change you identity _once_, changing you
identity again (unless you have committed a crime) is both
unecessary and pointless (you already have a new clean identity).

Well, yeah, it might move piracy up from an occaison annoyance
to a major problem, perhaps requirign every ship to be armed
and/or escorted.

Except this makes a major change in how war works.  Also, to
work the ships have to be able to detect each other in jump
space over interstellar distances, which is a big change.

Well, IMO, they can\'t anyways.

Wisely, Andy wants to see how good you are first - and I have not finished 
any of my Windows programs for Traveller.  Plus, I intend to use Delphi 
(pascal) and not C and probably Win 95/NT only (as so many things are much 
easier for the programmer in the 32-bit versions of Delphi).

Jo Grant has outlined, in a recent TML message, the hassles of writing the 
Dulinor Suite ... and I agree with him.  I write my programs for pleasure 
(strange, but true) which means that I follow my own timetable and not 
someone elses.  Andy probably wants someone a bit more malleable / proven!

I think I will e-mail Andy (with copies to programmers who have expressed 
interest in shared development) and see if I can get Andy to re-appraise his 
options.

The way I play it is that all ships have the following positions, and one
are optional, assuming the requisite systems are installed:

Full time usage for one or more people:
Pilot - determines exact settings, and reacts to real space and jump space
fluctuations.  What, exactly, is fluctuating is a maguffin, but the pilot
needs to see it happen, whatever it is, and react appropriately.  Good
decision support mechanisms can reduce this from a high stress experience
to a low stress one.

Astrogator - constantly reading sensor data and plotting it against charts
of the region to determine what, exactly, the pilot can expect to have to
react to.  A good plot reduces the pilot\'s stress.  Better computers make
much of this sensor analysis automatic, but the requirements go up with
tech level, and the demands go up as well.

Sensors - gets the sensor data, preprocesses it for the information the
Astrogator is interested in, and also looks for anything of concern, like
high velocity objects heading towards the vessel.  Here again, automatic
filters clear out much of the junk, leaving the human to decide whether to
wake the captain.

Engineer - drive tuning, so that when the pilot asks for an alteration in
how the drive is running, the requested alteration happens.  Better self
checks at higher TLs help this a lot.

Maintenance - scutwork, that is utterly needed.  Ships live and die by how
they are maintained.

Part time, or automatic, as long as no unusual circumstances occur:
Commo - if you do not need to communicate with anyone, this is superfluous.
Gunner - no guns means no gunner.  Gunners fix, maintain, and fire the
weapons.
Medic - ships without passengers and less than 50 crew often have a good
auto medic and a cold sleep berth.
Steward - people maintenance, cargo management, and general administrative
skills.

All of these would represent a rotating staff on duty every shift on a
military or merchant ship that is >5kt, but on a little ship, several jobs
may be done by one person.

For example, an X-boat jumps right near a tender which has already done the
preliminary jump plot and scanned nearby space.  Once jump begins, the poor
guy inside is very, very busy scanning everything in sight, crunching the
data, and tuning the drives to come out alive.  Very stressful, and only
possible with extremely good computers.  In my universe, the real reason
that no J6 xboats were every proposed is that the workload for a small
vessel would be just too high.

Note that skills are divided by two when splitting jobs, and that your
astrogator is often your sensor person, while your pilot is often your
common person.  You do not want them bumping into something they should not
because they were nattering to traffic control.

If we assume that very advanced computers are already doing reducing data
as much as possible, and that the human is there for the tough calls, then
this is less of a problem.

And the computers are welcome to it.  I assume that a "course plot" by a
human is actually a list of waypoints that the human wants to hit.  The
computer then builds a list of thrust vectors and a path that hits them all.

Where you need a human is: "Critical maguffin density approaching.  Scans
show plot points bearings 180 mark 29 and 101 mark 17, approaching fast.
Accept the plot point, or head into the maguffin?  <yes> <no>".

Nice image, but a bit too outre.  I rule that the gunner who fires the
weapons is in a nice, safe MFD on the bridge, in the center of the vessel.
The sot who sits near the turret is there in case the C3I link from the
bridge gets nailed, or the turret suffers a malfunction.

I essentially start with the assumption that the humans are needed, and
that since computer support will ease the burden, we then get some idea of
what is needed.

In my universe:
Largest "fully automated" ship that can have a crew of:
	1	2	4
9	-	-	100
A	-	100	200
B	100	200	400
C	200	400	800
D	400	800	1600
E	800	1600	3200
F	1600	3200	6400
G	3200	6400	12800

Standard automation drops this by a factor of two, and minimal automation
by another factor of two.  Note also that certain tasks go up in difficulty
if you have less levels of automation, to represent the fact that you
likely need to interrupt one important task for another the longer a task
takes.

So, Sylea can have a Scout/Courier run by one person, with standard
automation, while the late 3I can run a destroyer the same way.  On the
other hand, the "auto destroyer" will happily fire on any civilian ship
that moves inside its no-fly zones with nary a hesitation when combat
begins, and it is unlikely that the very busy human running things would
even notice until he saw INN that evening.

Yep.  The 3I made these kind of security bots illegal precisely because it
was hard to prevent massive lawsuits from the errors.

Ken, I think you misunderstood the thread. Semo et. al are talking about
why *actors* aren\'t running around in _Starship Troopers_ in hot plastic
suits. And the stormtrooper thing got brought up as an example.

I\'m sure even ILM won\'t pay to build AC into every Stormtrooper costume.

It may be superior to Joseph\'s design in some ways but at 14.7 meters in
length it won\'t fit into a standard barbette (Dia4.51mxH5.26m).  This might
be the reason Joseph decided to use an "inefficient" circular PAW.

Bruce hints at this in his Definitive Sensor rules--and he\'s using 30
minute space combat rounds.

He says:

"In the basic system, once a target is detected, the referee should
inform the sensor operator of the fact and the target\'s signature, and
place the ship\'s counter on the map (if you\'re using one)."

Then he goes on to say:

"After one turn of detection, the referee can inform the sensor operator
of the tonnage and basic configuration of the target;  after two turns,
the class."

I like what Bruce is saying here.  It does lead to great, interesting
role playing, and I\'ve been wanting this ever since I cracked open MT
and tried to make sense of their sensor rules.

What I want is simple.  I\'d like to see two things:

(1) A list of ever type of sensor available in Traveller (EMS, neutrino,
densitometer, etc).  The list needs to be broken up into active and
passive sensors, and each of those need to have scan (scanner) and lock
(tracker) modes.

Something like this:      Active EMS Scan
                          Active EMS Lock
                          Passive EMS Scan
                          Passive EMS Lock

                          ect.

(2)  Next to each sensor type, I\'d like to see a description of the type
of information that the sensor scan will reveal--information that GMs
can give to players and the mystery of what the target is unfolds.

Taking Bruce\'s remarks that I quoted above from his Definitive Sensor
Rules, I could see the entry for Active EMS Scan looking like this--

       Active EMS Scan:  1st turn--target\'s signature and location
                         2nd turn--target\'s tonnage and basic
configuration
                         3rd turn--target\'s class

Maybe the Active EMS Lock will reveal information in this manner (I\'m
just guessing here for the example)--

     Active EMS Lock:  1st turn--all the information under active EMS
scan, except                                   that it all comes in one
turn

I would think that it is standard procedure to do the following:

1) emerge from jump
2) take passive scan of area looking for things of interest, like ships
3) start heading to main world
4) periodically repeat passive scans

If something is of interest, then its acceleration and direction
should be calculated and the interval between scans decreased. 
Naturally, it might also be a good idea to use active scans on the
object too.

So, if I\'m in a system and detect no ships around, and it\'s four
hours to the main world, I might check back every fifteen minutes
with another passive scan. If there is a ship insystem but I calculate
that it\'s 18 hours away at 6G (I\'ll assume it can do that), then I
don\'t care about it. On the other hand, if it\'s 10 minutes away at
6G, I\'ll darn well check my sensors every minute or so.

The ship will certainly do that, but it will be about as reliable (in a
larger set of circumstances) as a modern car alarm is.  Many of those will
happily page you, but you then have to decide whether this is really a
break in, or someone leaning on it.

Essentially, figure that the stock anti hijack system will keep most people
out, but an electronics roll higher than the floor for the alarm on the
ship would get them past the lock, a stealth roll would get them past the
alarm system, a commo roll would let them blanket the antenna, and so on.

Essentially, if you have talent on board, you are going to be safe from
opposing talent, whereas if you buy talent in a box, then you run the risk
that a pro is going to walk all over it.

Further, as someone else mentioned, you will have higher tech people out
there that might do you worlds of harm.

I usually figure that if the players act reasonably, then they get
reasonable results - ie, it is unlikely that anyone will break into their
ship while it is in the high tech port and under the protection of port
security, unless PS helps.  Parked in a TL9 parking lot with no outside
security is also pretty safe for a TL12 ship, unless someone with TL12
tools and the skill to use them wants in.

Careful planning by very bright TL9 chaps could probably defeat TL12
standard security eventually, but they would have to work at it.

For example, if they feel paranoid, they will get nuisance calls regularly,
and will annoy port security, who feel that the group does not trust them.
On the other hand, they will likely get warned when most people try to
break in.  A group that takes no extra precautions, but is reasonably
careful will likely stop anyone who is not determined, and a group that is
noticeably lackadaisical will have a hard time stopping anyone.

	And what with their plasma guns and grenade launchers, they could
set off some pretty cool pyrotechnics too!

	This just gets better and better.  And wierder and wierder.  Which
are often one and the same thing :).

	Strangely enough, I can actually see something like this happening.
Militaries and drill being what they are, techniques that require a great
deal of training and skill to execute tend to be displayed for show; think
the Mounties and the Musical Ride, for example.  With something like BD,
where even moving take skill and can be quite dangerous, I\'d imagine that
drill displays would be somewhat more than just marching around in step.
Presumably, there\'d be a significant amount of coordinated _agility_
displayed in DB show drill...

Sounds like a misquote of various theories that try to unify the
forces (strong nuclear and electroweak) in a "geometric" fashion
similar to the way general relativity describes gravity in terms of what
can (sloppily) be thought of as fourth-dimensional geometry. These usually
end up with 10-15 extra "dimensions", all very sharply curved and hence
"small" in a hard-to-explain sense.

Certainly nothing special about the 5th vs the 11th in these theorries.

Don\'t even get me *started* on the Bible Code; a good lesson in large
number statistics/infinite-number-of-monkeys/finding patterns where none
exist. I believe there are a couple of nice web sites showing similar

buy the book :)!  Or even better, the answers to bar exam questionaires!

	On an amusing related note, right now somebody on sci.astro.amateur
is raving on about how you can pick out "SETI messages" (presumably

I folded the 2*rangefactor into the sensor sensitivities and
signatures and the detection table instead, sot hat (a) players wouldn\'t have
to multiply, and (b) (more important) sensor sensitivities could be more
easily compared - an AEMS-14 has about the same range as a PEMS-14. 
That\'s why active sensors have to use a different detection table.

There\'s a table buried deep in the rules (somewher at the end, I think)
about how senosr sensitivity scales with scan duration (which is to say,
turn length); basically, if you\'re using really short turns you lose 0.5 or 1.0
points of sensitivity and if you use real long ones add a point or so.

As far as how long it takes you to ID a target...I\'m working on it,
but don\'t currently have time to do the calculations in detail. Back-of-the-
envelope I\'d say if the signal gets up to 2 or so you learn things like the
power output or hull size; around 3 you learn the class (if you\'ve seen

As someone mentioned towards my post about automated
starships, Traveller is primarily a game, rather than
a mirror of the Laws of Nature.

To me, privateering is an adventurous and romantic view
of Traveller, and permitting pirates to roam hungrily in
the weaker solar systems of the less-civilised parts 
of the Imperium adds flavor, danger, and caution to
the players\' lives.  It may even give them direction,
as privateers under a letter of marque or just occasional
rogues looking for a quick chunk of revenue.

In the end, pirates are a useful game tool, a unique
obstacle to the players\' survival.  And they don\'t have
to be justified by the referee... they can just exist
and ambush the players.

2. Automation

....and as far as starship automation goes, I say the less
the better.  Down with automation!  Let the characters use
their hard-earned skills.

I have to step in here. Mathematicians may have looked at the Bible Code,
but have any Semitic philologists? Remember that they\'re dealing with
Hebrew here, and Hebrew, like other Semitic languages, doesn\'t write its
vowels, relies on triconsononantal roots, and includes strong similarities
in meaning between words that share a root.

When the folks in the Bible Code camp say that they\'ve found two words that
"cross" they\'ve found the consonants in the words, not the vowels; vowels
will determine meaning. Also, Semitic languages\' notion of tense is not at
all similar to Indo-European languages\', so there\'s no reason why a
particular Indo-European tense should be used.

So "assassin will assassinate" would be something like "QTL QTL" (I only
know Arabic, but biblical Hebrew is pretty close), and those letters could
mean a bunch of other things, like "he killed a killer," "murder a
murderer," "he killed," "he will kill," etc. Unless there\'s a particle in
between (QTL SQTL) there\'s no way to determine tense. Also, letters can be
used as numbers, and that makes it easy to find dates.

English doesn\'t work this way, so not surprisingly, it\'s harder to find
similar patterns in texts written in English (though the folks who\'ve
plowed through Shakespeare has done a pretty good job).

	Just out of curiosity, does this dodge work with Latin versions of
the Bible?  Which version of the Bible does it work with best?  Does using
a pocket King James produce the same result as using a large illustrated
RSV?  How far back do the predictions run?  Did it predict that King James
of Scotland would hang Black Jock Armstrong?  What does it have to say
about the future of Tung Chee-Hwa as CE of the HK SAR?  Would it work with
a Japanese translation of the Bible written in Kanji?

Me! Me! I\'m still a hold out!  I dropped out of the piracy arguement,
mostly due to lack of time to research the issue.  Hans is able to muster
an impressive array of data to bolster his arguments!  :)

Hans\' position against piracy, as I understand his arguements, is based on
a policy of equal resource allocation, absolute zero tolerance, and
incredible force of will.  The Imperium that he proposes is very
organized, incredibly efficient, with a highly developed police force.

I, OTOH, believe that resources will be allocated according to political
power (Class A and B starports very well patrolled, Class C starports
adequately well patrolled, Class D and E starports get visits). I believe
that tolerance to piracy will exist, provided that it does not affect the
"powers that be" (ie. it doesn\'t affect the standard of living for the
majority of citizens, and doesn\'t make a dent in the bottom line of the
corporations serving the world) or the nobles administering the world, and
that counter-piracy measures will be put in place _in_reaction_to_ active
piracy, not as a standard feature of system defense.  I do, however, think
that it has mostly been stamped out in the core sectors, there does need
to be a \'frontier\' to run for when things get too hot!   (but then, that\'s
why my campaign is based out in the Spins).

Transponders, by canon, are incredibly difficult to change.  Impossible.
I have modified that to a certain extent, in that I allow for multiple
transponders to be installed, with separate power switches.  I also have
my Imperial inspectors look for that!  I do not allow a single transponder
to have multiple identities, and it is _difficult_ to remove a transponder
from a victim, and successfully install it on a new ship.

GG refueling doesn\'t work for starship merchants on a schedule, unless the
mainworld is a satellite of the GG.  That doesn\'t mean it does not exist,
however.  Scouts, hunters, nobles, in-system merchants, and a variety of
others may take advantage of this.  Fuel supplies for starships could very
well be \'mined\' from GGs, rather than taken from the system member worlds.

I\'ve gone into pirate tactics and my views on anti-piracy tactics rather
at length in other posts.  Unless someone really wants to hear \'em again,
I\'ll skip these questions.

Admittably, my final defense for piracy tends to run to playability.  They
are fun to play, and add flavor to my campaign.  I tend pessimism I guess,
because I do believe that the structure of the Imperium is going to
include corruption, and that all the vices that we see on the Earth today
(including, I might add, piracy) will follow us to the stars...

Well, a ship will not have everything the "could" be put
into it.  It will have everything that the designer decided
to put into it.  If he felt that his clientel would be
parking the ship at ports and wouldn\'t be carrying around
communicators all the time, then he might not.

Unless, of course, they disable the appropriate sensors
as they break in.  Training in bypassing security systems
will cover fooling people or machines.  And, unles the
ship is an AI, it will be easier to fool.  And you have
the right to annoy them with false alarms.

There is also roleplaying issue.  One of my players seems
to treat every issue regarding keeping watches, being
undermanned, etc. with the attitude "the ship will do it".
But if you let the ship get around the players challenges,
roleplaying is reduced one more step to simply an exercise
in surviving combat.  I think it detracts from the experience
important events are resolved by rolling for the ship without
player involvement and it isn\'t in the spirit of the original
Traveller.

Thanks, Chris.  That _is_ exactly why I designed it that way.  I suspect a
toroidal _spinal_mount_ scale weapon would be a terrible idea in terms of
damage control, battle worthiness, etc. -- but at small sizes like a
measly six-ton barbette, I don\'t see much difference in the resistance of
the weapon itself to starship-scale damage.

So, my question remains: is this weapon any good as it stands, in terms of
damage and reach, or would a laser be a better use of volume and energy? 
It\'s been too long since I dabbled in Traveller space combat.  I\'d whip up
a few barbette-scale lasers myself for the comparison, but I\'m about to
chaperone a bunch of seventh graders on a road trip to the Four Corners
region of Colorado. (Hm... Any TML folks in that neck of the woods?  :-)

Really?  That must have been news to the Kuwaitis who assumed that the war
started on 2 August 1990, when six Iraqi divisions invade Kuwait and
conquor it.

The Coalition launched its massive air campaign.  In 24 hours, the
Coalition drooped more explosives on Iraq than dropped by the Germans
during the entire Battle of Britian, so I think the Iraqis might also
dispute the start of the being on 18 January.

have limited fields of view (for various reasons), the sensor operator

away on particular segments where an enemy ship is thought to be more
likely to be. A sensible operator will probably split the time so a 
whole-sky scan happens every turn or so using perhaps 50% of the sensor time...
and spend the rest on particular regions...but the exact tradeoffs aren\'t
obvious, and depend a lot on the situation, particular sensor, likely
opposition, local environment, etc. It becomes even more complicated
if you\'re trying to get FC locks on previously-detected targets while
sweeping for new targets. There\'s also the question of deciding if the
2-sigma detection you got last sweep is real or not, and how to 
string together multiple 2-sigma detections of a probably-moving target.

All this *could* be automated, but it\'s not quite as trivial as one might
think. 

Actually, a sensor operator\'s job is a lot like an astronomers...

That "backlot" was Tunisia.  The Stormtroopers spent *hours* in costume,
and each suit had a small fan built in.  They also had a "cold tent" for
between-take cooling off.

    'body' => '	This week, somebody (I forgot who; I was studying at the time)
suggested that somebody (hints were dropped about Famille Spofulam) try to
design a .75 recoilless (i.e. rocket slug firing) pistol based on the
Stainless Steel Rat\'s sidearm of choice.  As I\'ve now written the exam in
question (1 down 5 to go), I decided to design said pistol since I had
nothing better to do this evening (clear skies all week and the one night I
have the time to take the binocs out it clouds over).  For no apparent
reason I decided to do it at TL-11, but it could be done at TL\'s 10 or up
with no change.

	Here it is.  Boy is it ugly.  Optimal range is at at up to 3 meters
or so using HE rounds where damage from round kinetic energy, explosive
charge, and propellant burning inside of target will do a whopping 7.5 dice
of damage (I use 1/2 dice for damage in my camapigns).  Armour penetration
is weak at low ranges and reaches a maximum of 4.5, due to the low but
increasing velocity of the round.

	I\'ve made a number of assumptions concerning propellant burn over
distance and other things; these are noted in the design notes, below.  I\'d
appreciate commentary on these assumptions from anybody who knows more than
I do about guns, rocketry, and the health effects on human beings of rocket
propellant combusting in freshly inflicted bullet wounds.

	Recoil is indeed low; only 0.67 in FF&S terms for a single round;
derisory compared to some FS designs, and a gryoscopic or inertial recoil
compensator would drastically lower this; a gyro-comped version would be .5
kg heavier, 300 cr more, and have a single-shot recoil of 0.273 (!).

	Also, this might make an interesting test of the Bible Code; can
anybody find a prediction of me doing this design in there?  Try looking in
the juicier bits of Leviticus or the grumpier Poverbs :).

	Finally, Ross: I want to ditch the .47 automag and use this as
G=FC=FCstag\'s varmint pistol :)!

Round:

Cal:			19mm
Rated energy:		2500 joules [what the heck :)]
Base area:		283.52 mm^2
Propellant volume:	2083.33 mm^3
Bullet length:		19mm
Min case length:	18.37
Round length:		40 mm (figured I\'d round up; has nice ring to it)
Round Mass:		90.7 grams (yikes)
Ideal barrel length:	27.7 cm (assumes smoothbore barrel and use of
			normal explosive, non-rocket, round propulsion)
Round price:		3.63 cr/round ordinary (would suggest at least
			doubling to reflect wierdness).
Designation:		.75 SSR Recoilless

	I\'m going to assume that the round burns 520.75 mm^3 of propellant
per meter travelled.  I realize that this is an average figure, so based on
the S.W.A.G. principle since I\'ve never studied rocketry I\'m going to
assume that 50% of propellant is burned in the first meter to reflect
acceleration from rest.  Making another S.W.A.G-based estimate, I\'m going
to assume that 15% of the first 50% of propellant will be burned in-barrel,
for a total in-barrel burn of 187.5 joules worth of propellant.

	I have no idea how realistic these assumptions are and would
welcome input from anybody more educated than myself on these matters.

energy outside the gun I\'m going to proceed with a light reciever; the
amount of blowback energy is only 187.5 joules).  I\'m adding only a hollow
pistol grip; laser pointers etc probably wouldn\'t help with this sort of
round.

   Actually, IIRC some of the scenes were actually shot in the desert
(North Africa?).  But you are correct, it\'s not like you see them for 20
minutes straight.  On the other hand, who says we have to see the troops
in "Starship Troopers" in full gear for more than a few minutes at a
time anyway?  The movie is *suppose* to be about soldiers, not their
really neat gear.

<snip>

   It\'s worse than that.  If someone is wearing one of those suits
faints or even throws up (which has happened I understand), Disney rules
state that they must be taken out of public view before the head can be
removed.  Imagine the joy of seeing Goofy fall to the ground and start
to smell icky before some of his "associates" can carry him away.  No
wonder the characters travel in packs.

   Disney impresses me as a place I\'d rather *not* work for...

   I\'m not saying that it wouldn\'t be *extremely* demanding to have
people running around in faux battledress in a movie.  The director
would have to be willing to make certain sacrifices and rely on FX
technology to make it happen, however.

Opinions? Hmm ...
 
> 1) the existence & dwelling places of piracy in the Imperium

Scarce to non-existent in a properly run, functioning Imperium. Sure, you
will have your individual cases of people "going for it," but I would
expect these to have the lifespan of a mayfly. There are far too many
easier ways to steal things, ways that do not involve multi-million credit
investments. If you managed to steal a ship, I have a hard time believing
that "It\'s a pirate\'s life for me!" would be the best way to capitalize on
it.

Imagine stealing a 747. What would you and your group of friends do with
it? 

> 2) the ability & ease in changing ship transponder signals

No comment.

> 3) the frequency of GG refueling visits

Not very.

> 4) T4 pirates\' modus operandi

Get \'em planetside. It\'s easier and more profitable. That is, unless there
is a dancing army of millions of battle-dress-equipped troops with
chameleon option set to "Suave Mauve" to prevent fraud, embezzlement, grav
vehicle jacking, etc.

> 5) level of effort by the Imperium to control piracy

Pretty high. It has the technology, the ships (and ships and more ships!!!)
and the manpower. The space between worlds *is* the Imperium, with
intersteller commerce it\'s lifeblood. I cannot see complacency in this on
the part of the Imperial government.

Okay.  I\'ll buy that.  But pictures of crew members?  This part I\'d doubt.
 The sheer amount of Traveller materials that just concern characters
becoming crew members, etc.  The number of people who are going to work their
way on a "work passage" to another system would seem to preclude any
organized database of crew members.

Hah!  That\'s a pretty good one.

Okay.  However, my take on the transponder thing is that when people will
pirate transponders, they will use legitimate codes either sold to them by
other traders, sold to them by corrupt starport workers, or corrupt naval
types.  Usually it would be safest for a group of pirates to use ships that
would be a good distance away.

Example, Senior Captain "Knuckles" Knickerson goes off to make his fortune on
the Coreward Vargr Chew Toy trade route.  He sells his registration and
transponder info to either a group of pirates, or an organized crime group
who "clones" transponders.

Another example, Ted "Average Starport Lout" hears that Knuckles is off to
the Vargr Chew Toy routes and sells his registration info to either of the
above.  Or, a minor naval officer makes a deal to sell info on ships that
haven\'t been in the local subsector, sector, or domain for a year or more.

I would think that transponders would be the weakest link in the chain of
piracy prevention.  They would serve as a deterrent to the "weekend" pirate,
but to anyone interested in piracy as a career it would be relatively minor.
 Once technology has existed for more than a few years, those who want to
break the law will.

Depends on what you mean by "serious help".  In my opinion, organized crime
would have a hand (and a stake) in helping (or _possibly_ sponsoring
pirates).  As a result, there would be many services and options for piracy
on many worlds throughout the Imperium.  And, for every new safeguard that
the Imperial navy, organized crime has ways (and $$$ reasons) to try and get
around.

Just some ideas.

I never intended for this thread to become un-Traveller related. I only
wanted to bring up the 5th dimesion stuff.

But, since you asked, all of the ones you cite above are translations. 
The Bible Code works off of the ancient Hebrew, from which all of those
translations were translated from.

....and, I\'ve only completed Chapter 1 (which is like three chapters
because there\'s notes on chapter one and notes on the illustrations in
chapter one that are quite long).

According to the book, you\'re almost certainly correct.  I just prefer to

Why not Barney has a fan that he has placed in his mouth, but even then the

It was very interesting to watch him get into the suite ie from the bottom,
the suite is suspended from above, and he crawls in underneath.

Uh, actually, yes it has.

This is how the author became a believer in the Bible Code in the first
place.

Yitzhak Rabin\'s name was found in September 1995.  The author contacted
Yitzhak Rabin through one of Rabin\'s life long friends to warn him that
his life was in danger.

Rabin, of course, was a skeptic, and didn\'t believe in this Bible Code
nonsense.  A month later, on November 4, 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was dead
from an assassin\'s bullet.

Israli Intelligence was all of a sudden very interested in the Bible
Code\'s author, Michael Drosnin, and they interviewed him.

Before that, the Bible Code\'s discoverer, Eli Rips, had discovered the
Gulf War before it happened.

Rips found "Hussein picked a day", and close to this was encoded,
"January 18, 1991", "Saddam", "missile", "Enemy", and "war".

This was three weeks before the Gulf War started--by Hussein launching
his first scud missile attack.  That day was Jaunaury 18, 1991.

How\'s that for predicting things?

Acutally, no.  The book is written from a very secular, skeptical point
of view.  It is very fact oriented.  The religious people interviewed in
the book say that God coded the book.  They cite that the original
Bible, handed down from God to Moses on Mount Sinai, was written with no
spaces between words as one long character stream--exactly what must be
done with the old manuscripts in order for the computer to decode the
Bible Code.

Other, more secular people intervied in the book do not theorize how the
Bible became encoded.  Some do not believe in God, so this is not an
option.  All agree (so far) that the Code is not a hoax, but they cannot
explain how the Bible became encoded.

The book (again, so far) is written so that you can draw your own
conclusions.  If you think the Bible is encoded by God, then more power
to you.  If you think Grandfather did it, then that\'s OK too.

OK. Consider the Stanley Steamer -- still holds (AFAIK) the world record for the
fastest steam car -- around 120 mph, IIRC. Now, look at pictures of the Stanley
- -- it is no more AF or SL than the Model "T". So it seems to me that there is no
reason why a USL hull couldn\'t handle even stratospheric/jet stream winds of at
least that speed. Which means that all the Starport approach control has to do
is to make sure the everyone takes off in one direction, with a good
height/distance separation and lands from another, also with a good
height/distance separation. If the SS can do 120 mph or so, I don\'t see why a
USL Spacecraft would have problems. Makes a Spaceport seem more Airport-like,
but so what? Perhaps you could even have two or more different Ports, one for
high speed landings and takeoffs and another, perhaps in a different hemisphere
if you really feel you need the separation, for slow landings/takeoffs by USL
vessels.

The problem is, of course, not the original blanket restriction on landing USL
spacecraft on worlds with an atmosphere -- because we had no idea *why* that was
the case (lots of mental handwaving), we could accept it as "fact". However,
later material has been too detailed and has explained how CG or Thrusters
"work" -- and once we have those facts, we can see that there is no reason why
USL ships *cannot* land as I have said. None whatsoever. Unless, of course,
someone *official* wants to come up with a logical explanation that adds to
rather than contradicts current knowledge/canon. Marc? You out there somewhere?

Personally, I don\'t see any problems with allowing USL ships to land -- it makes
a damn good adventure hook ... *because* they cannot land fast and take off fast
they cannot be involved in smuggling or make a fast getaway when needed. Even on
a Tech 7 world AAA fire would be a *real* threat on both landing and takeoff.
Now, considering that most of Trav has always been in the "wilds", this becomes
a *real* threat and limitation ... making it a design flaw for most PCs, though
there is no Naval Architecture reason why you can\'t do it!

Makes at least as much sense as anything else!

        1.Considering the inhospitable nature of most planets outside the
Habitable zone (according to the world detailing systems in WTH or WBH)  I
doubt that there would be much in-system traffic with two exceptions:
        a)to a nearby GG, 
        b) If the main world is orbiting a GG, in which case There are
likely to be several other habitable worlds very close. (Albeit very easily
defended).
        2.Much of the discussion (IMHO)seems to be about whether The
Imperium has the ability to make piracy almost a dead issue.  I think that
whatever tweaks you employ, the Imperial Navy, could easily guard its
citizens from piracy, especially where system defences are inadequate.
After all this is part of the reason that they are in the imperium.
Capacity aside, it seems that the real issue will be what sort of imperium
you think we are dealing with.  Short of some sacred ruling, it seems
possible that in some campaigns the imperium cares more than in others about
its citizens, and this is probably the most useful guide as to the extent of
piracy.

> 1) the existence & dwelling places of piracy in the Imperium
	
	Certainly out of the way locations make better hunting grounds in 
terms of avoiding naval patrols, but they also mean that there will be 
less prey to be had.  Despite what some have said, I would think that the 
Spinward Marches would be a particularly _bad_ place for pirates because 
of the heavy military presence and the tensions that would make any 
suspicious ship the subject of a lot of attention.

> 2) the ability & ease in changing ship transponder signals

	This is likely to be as difficult as the Imperial authorities can 
make it.  It could also be backed up by using personal ID checks on the 
captain and crew to make sure that the captain-of-record is still in 
control of the ship.  This would also be crucial for the bank that made 
the starship loan.

> 3) the frequency of GG refueling visits

	Last resort.  These trips are uneconomical for merchants and 
inconvenient for everyone else.  Only scouts or military are likely to 
make much use of this technique.

> 4) T4 pirates\' modus operandi

	This is the hard part.  I have trouble imagining how a pirate 
could make any money.  First of all, merchants will only be found in and 
around the 100-d limit of their destination.  If the destination has even 
_one_ SDB in orbit then the pirate has an extremely short time window to 
stop its target, seize the cargo, and get away.  If the destination has 
no SDBs but the target is armed, the pirate is still in trouble because 
any hits by the target are likely to be rather costly to repair.  
Furthermore, if pirates are only using armed merchantmen, then the target 
may be an almost even match.  Finally, even if the merchant is unarmed 
and there are no SDBs, the merchants first choice is going to be to run 
since letting a band of murderous thugs onto your ship has got to be a 
_very_ unappealing option.
	With all that going against pirates, I\'d think that they\'d have 
to be able to make more money as honest merchants.  Their only chance, 
IMHO, is if they can steal the target ship and resell it someplace.  But 
this makes their life so much harder in other ways that I won\'t go into it.

> 5) level of effort by the Imperium to control piracy

	Sine the Imperium rules the space between worlds, rather than the 
worlds themsevles, I would think that piracy would be seen as a threat to 
the Imperium\'s legitimacy.  What does the subsector Duke have to do 
besides keep the spacelanes safe for commerce?  The real clincher though 
is that it takes so little to make piracy almost impossible and this 
effort would be the same as used to stop other kinds of clandestine 
activity in space.  Having a few SDBs per system, something that very 
nearly all worlds will be able to afford themselves, would stop all kinds 
of piracy, Zho terrorism, or other funny business and would provide good 
peace-time exercises for the crew.

	Yes.  I think people have gotten too caught up in the details of 
Hans\' numbers.  Even if you reduce naval spending to 1% of GDP it still 
only takes about 150,000 people to support an SDB.  That means your 
average American suburb could afford one.

Well, you are better off actually reading the arguements and
making up your own mind.  However, if you want to know.  Obviously,
since I have been a major poster of counter arguements to Hans,
I don\'t agree with him.  I don\'t think that pirates need, or
would be using bases (which is what I assume #1 applies to).
As to transponders not only don\'t think they would a realiable
way of telling pirates, I have doubts the Imperium would even
bother with them.  I think Gas Giants would have "significant"
(somewhere between 20% and 80% of the traffic).  Pirates would
be also operating as smugglers and legit traders.  The Imperium
would have piracy relegated to fringe areas with less traffic.

I should point out that the thread was origionally discussing the army
of Mora as being equipted with Battledress.  Mora is a matriarchy.  I
suspect that a gould portion of the Moran army, probably most of it,
will be female.  Somehow this spectacle would seem a lot campier in a
male army rather than in a female army; perhaps we need to be discussing
the army of a different planet. :)

<BLOCKQUOTE TYPE=CITE>
<PRE>Although I don\'t have the books around to check it out, I\'ve always
thought that Battledress skill can be used at -1 for Vac Suit skill, but
*not* the other way around.

In the same way, Pilot skill (-1) counts as Ship\'s Boat skill, but not
the reverse.

So, if I have Pilot-3, I can use Ship\'s Boat-2. If I\'ve got Ship\'s Boat,
I can\'t drive the big ships. If I\'ve got Vac Suit-5, that\'s not enough
to use Battledress.

I might be mistaken in the reading of the rules, but in any case, that\'s

Let me just repeat that I don\'t dispute the canonical existence of piracy
in the Imperium in the Traveller _background_. What I claim is that the
_rules_ makes the existence of pirates almost impossible as they stand.
In other words, I claim that there is an inconsistency. Whether this
inconsistency is best resolve by changing the rules or the background is
also clear to me: It would be much better to change the rules than the
background. Pirates are fun (as long as they are confined to RPGs, that
is). Unfortunately I also think that the rules changes necessary to make
pirates a viable career choice is big enough to smash the Traveller
universe in other ways, so the solution I myself employ is to _ignore_
the inconsistency. But that dosen\'t change the fact that I believe that
there is such an inconsistency. 

>Hans\' position against piracy, as I understand his arguements, is based on
>a policy of equal resource allocation, 

It most certainly is not. It\'s based on a most unequal resource allocation.
0.2% of the standard naval budget used for piracy suppression.

>absolute zero tolerance, and incredible force of will.  The Imperium that

Not just the Imperium. Any interstellar state with less than a score of
planets per high-population planet.

The one rule that change things drastically from any historical example is
the one that allow a ship to get from point A to point B without passing
through the spots in between. Just imagine how tough Earth pirates would
have had it if ships could teleport from just outside one harbor to just
outside another! 
 
>I, OTOH, believe that resources will be allocated according to political

You forget that the ships that would be lost if Class C, D, and E systems
weren\'t adequately patrolled mostly belongs to the powerful worlds. If
there weren\'t enough patrol ships to go around, I\'d agree with you. I\'m 
sure that given the unpalatable choice between defending their home world
and defending their trade, the powers that be would elect to defend the
home world. But what I claim is that they don\'t have to make that choice.

It\'s like saying that since the Sumatra Strait wasn\'t very important in
itself, John Company didn\'t care if the Royal Navy patrolled it or not.
The reason the RN didn\'t have a permanent patrol in the Sumatra Strait
wasn\'t that they didn\'t want to, it was that they didn\'t have enough
ships to do it.

OK. You\'re the Admiral in charge of defending a Subsector. You have a fleet
worth MCr270,000,000. 70% of that is invested in system defenses for your
worlds. the remaining 81,000,000 is invested in your fleet. You can either
have 223 Tigress class battleships (or a mix of battleships and cruisers
equivalent to that) and distribute them among the 5 or six most important
worlds and leave the remaining 30 worlds uncovered. Or you can have 222
Tigresses (or the equivalent) plus 360 Kinunirs and put a dozen of each
in the remaining 30 systems as an early warning system. What would you
chose? (OK,OK, you\'ll take 221 Tigresses and make sure you have plenty of
couriers too).

The Gas Giant issue is a different one. The navy has plenty of patrol ships
to go round. If a Gas Giant is used for refuelling then it will be
patrolled, no problem.

Hey, I agree with you 100% on that. It just dosen\'t change my opinion
about the discrepancy between the background and the rules.

If you can give me a historical example of a city that had 500 times as
many full-time militia-men as it had street corners and still allowed
muggers to work the streets, then I will take my opinion up to revision.
The difference isn\'t in human nature but in the number of places that
a Traveller navy needs to cover. If you want pirates to have a shot,
realistically, you either have to change from jump drive to warp drive
or change the ratio of high-population planets to other planets
drastically.
 
That isn\'t going to stop me from throwing a pirate at my players the next
time I feel like it, though.

I\'m glad these don\'t exist, the temptation to misuse them on

i) I wish I were 21 again and knew everything... [*]
ii) Can\'t I just kill *one* as an example to the others?

Actually, ii) would just prolong the mass hysteria.  Lucky escape

Well, FWIW I have toyed with the idea of super-dimensions of the same 
form, possibly a "spiritual" dimension which has some links to the 
psionic, but only really in the context of Traveller/SF.  I forget 
who mentioned big/small dimensions (I think Leonard E., who\'s 
dangerously knowledgeable about physical science) but I agree: string 
theory postulates extra dimensions which can be badly explained in 
books on religion.

Which version? 8-)

There is no one "original" copy of any Biblical book, and (virtually) 
no two ancient sources which agree...

I ought to add to the voices shouting that ancient Hebrew (written 
without vowels) is very easy to make a huge variety of words from.  
This is probably true of modern Hebrew also.

However... ancient Hebrew had a very restricted vocabulary and is 
hard to translate into English at the best of times.  Modern Hebrew 
probably has a much larger vocabulary, which will make performing the 
same trick harder.  If this is so, then using the same method of 
"interpretation" on the bible and a modern Hebrew translation of 
(say) War and Peace will almost certainly give you more "significant" 
matches for the ancient Hebrew.

You also get the transliteration effect, whereby names in one 
alphabet can be spelled several ways in another, like Tsar/Czar from 
Cyrillic.  This makes it easier to find proper names in a Hebrew 
text.

ObTrav: I wonder if Old High Vilani can be treated in analagous ways?

Don\'t forget that it doesn\'t take that much thrust to change the
direction the ship is pointing. And that\'s *all* you can do anyway. To
change the direction you are *moving* you have to use the main drive
anyway. Unless you feel like taking a few weeks.

Remember, unlike the QE2, or even an aircraft, the ship doesn\'t care
which way it is pointing, and except during landing/takeoff, the only
resistance top turning it is the ship\'s moment of inertia.

Escape velocity and potential energy are related. The potential energy
of an object in a gravity well is the kinetic energy it\'d have at
escape velocity. 

But CG isn\'t neutralizing grvity that way. If it did, as you note,
you\'d already have escaped the planet. Therefore, it isn\'t affecting
the potential energy. It\'s just providing a force that counterbalances
the force of gravity. So you still have to supply the energy required
to lift the ship.

Actually, at high altitudes, you get things like the jetstream (300
knots or better!), and at extrememly high altitudes, I understand you
can get some *really* fast winds. 

Worse, at high altitudes, the speed of sound is different. Depending on
altitude it can be a *lot* slower or faster. At 30 knots I think you
are safe from exceeding the limiting Mach number of the hull, but
someone is bound to try cheating...

Sure. If you read my post, you\'ll also notice that this was given as a
"limiting case".

On the other hand, now that someone has posted that fast drug makes a
jump take 2.8 hours, I think it *would* work. In three or four hours,
not even a slaver\'s "dense pack" is going to result in any serious
physical problems. Though I suspect that a modest percentage of the
passengers would suffer from claustrophobia afterwards.

Of course, if it\'s possible to administer slow drug and then a good
sedative, they can sleep thru the whole trip!

I suggest that you sit down and calculate just how much water (and
hence, hydrogen) a world *has* in it\'s oceans.

For example, let\'s take a world the size of Earth. Say 6000 km radius.
And let\'s say that there\'s enough water to cover the surface 1 meter
deep if it was spread evenly. 

Surface area is 4 * pi * r^2. R is 6,000,000 meters. So there are
4.5e14 m^3 of water. If they are shipping out a *billion* tons of water
a year it\'ll take 4.5e14/1e9 years. That\'s 452 *thousand* years. Call
it half a million years.

Now consider that Earth has enough water that if spread out evenly it\'d
be over a *kilometer* deep. So that raises the figure to half a
*billion* years.

It\'s gonna take a *long* time to cause any significant effects on any
planet that has any sort of reasonable hydro figure.

Planets are *huge*. Yes, we\'ve managed to cause some damage to this
one. But the only "lasting" damage so far are things that act like
*catalysts. It only takes a small amount of chlorine at the right
altitude to interfere with the ozone layer. And it only takes a little
pesticide in the surface layers of the ocean to reduce the number of
plankton. 

But trying to export enough water (seawater) to cause a noticable
effect would be a major project.

Because of it\'s electronegativity. Basicly, what you are doing when you
smelt an ore is convincing the oxygen that is attached to the metal
atoms to attach to something else. But for this to work, the something
else must be something that oxygen likes better. This is measured in
terms of electronegativity. The more electronegative an element is, the
better oxygen (or other oxiders) likes it.

The problem with aluminum is that there\'s nothing that is more
electronegative that isn\'t *already* tied up with oxygen. So you can\'t
use the usual trick of "heat ore with reducing agent" to liberate it.

The only way is to use electricity to either produce the aluminum via
the Hall process, or to use electricity to produce something like
sodium or calcium (which are far more electronegative, but much easier
to produce electricall unless you know the Hall process). 

The early production of aluminum *was* by producing calcium or sodium,
then reacting them with alumina (aluminum oxide) in the absence of
oxygen. It worked, but was hideously expensive. So much so, that one of
the Napoleon\'s ate off am aluminum plate while others at the table had
to make do with mere gold. And it\'s why the capstone of the Washington
Monument is a pyramid of aluminum (bought by contributions of school
children all over the country, it was produced by *Tiffany\'s* and
displayed inder heavy guard before being placed on top))

If it wasn\'t for the fact that aluminum forms a *tough* oxide coat
(sapphire is a form of aluminum oxide!) it\'d react with *water*. In
fact, strong alkali solutions don\'t affect alumin but they *do*
dissolve the oxide coat. Thus the bare metal is exposed to the water,
causing it to take oxygen from it, releasing hydrogen. This forms a new
layer of oxide which almost immediately dissolves in the alkali...
repeat until you run out of water or aluminum.

Only thing is, you *don\'t* fill the tanks with water. Given what you
*have* to do to extract the hydrogen, nothing bigger than a virus is
likely to get into the purifier (you\'d use ceramic filters such as are
used in survival gear) and even those won\'t survive the extraction of
the hydrogen. You\'d either electrolyze the water, which tends to be
exceedingly unhealthy for anything in it and doesn\'t let any viruses
travel with the gas anyway. Or you\'d "thermally crack" the water. This
involves heating it to a few thousand degrees (hot enough that the
water breaks down into free oxygen and free hydrogen) and that\'ll be
the best sterilization routine you ever saw. :-)

And since what you have in your fuel tanks when you land to refill is
liquid hydrogen (at less than -253 C), you certainly aren\'t going to be
*dumping* it. 

The same goes for drinking water. You went to a lot of trouble to
obtain and purify it. You won\'t dump it, and you\'ll be *damn* sure to
sterilize any you pick up from a "natural" source.

That leave things attaching to the hull, and sewage. Between vacuum,
rentry, and solar radiation in space while running to and from jump
points, nothing is going to live on the hull that can live on a planet.

And while you could dump your sewage, that\'s probably been processed by
life supoort to reduce bulk. Given the supply of "free" heat from the
fusion reactor, the sewage has probably been "baked" to extract the
water and turn the remainder into a dry powder. And in the process,
sterilized. This is actually a good idea, as it\'s much simpler to store
the powder (compressed into blocks?) and the water extracted from it.

Sure folks *might* be unwilling to drink or wash with the extracted
water (though I doubt it). But even so, it\'s *much* simpler to store
and pump pure water than sewage. And I\'m sure that folks would rather
have a holding tank full of water, than one of sewage. If it springs a
leak, it\'s much easier to deal with.

Any other avenues for contamination are likely going to be present even
if the ship lands in the port.

Not if the suit is designed intelligently! That would almost *have* to

In what way is learning to move in a powered suit different from
learning to move on a low g planet? In both cases, your muscles and
reflexes are way out of synch with the way you *now* move. 

The one real difference is that you might have more time to react in
low g.

Then by the same reasoning, you can\'t use off-world troops in combat.
And the human brain is *very* flexible. Consider the experiments with
things like reversing glasses (they either swap what you see right for
left or top for bottom). At first the volunteers had to be led around.
But within *days* they were handling things ok, and within a few weeks
their brains "swapped" the images and they started seeing things
"normally". Then when the glasses were removed, they had a much shorter
period of re-adjusting to seeing things without the glasses.

I\'m biased against the "suit makes the appropriate move" because if
nothing else there\'s the fact that unless you make the suit *huge* (big
enough that the operator fits entirely within the torso, with some room
to spare) the operator\'s limbs *have* to move in sequence with the
limbs of the suit. And since I can just about guarantee that the period
of swing for arm and leg motions will be *different* for the suit than
for an unarmored person, you\'d have the operator\'s leg swinging forward
at a moment when the suit\'s leg needs to swing backwards, Or vice-versa.
And that\'s flat out *impossible* if the wearer\'s leg is in the suit\'s
legs. Ditto for the arms.

You can do that sort of thing for a *remotely* operated unit. But even
then, the feedback would be helaciously complex. How do you deal with
the suit\'s toe hitting an obstruction as it moves forward (just passing
the bottom of the swing) as the operator\'s foot is swinging *backwards.
Feedback just won\'t make any *sense* in that sort of situation.

BTW, I can\'t see that learning to operate the suit is harder than
learning to ride a bike... Ok, a unicycle... :-)

But as I noted, the suit is *not* that different from operating under
lower gravity (aside from issues involving the fragility of your
surroundings). So if a person can\'t learn the reflexes to operate the
suit, he can\'t learn the reflexes to walk on the moon.

I thought that the analysis of the ant neural nets showed that one of
the "reflexes" involved was "I just contacted something, draw back and
try moving thru a different arc"?

Well, given that from what I read (don\'t recall where), they either
created a set of "reflexes" and found that they were sufficient, or
they "reverse engineered" the neural net of the real ants to determine
what "reflexes" were present.

Ok, but surely we can learn *something* from them.

In the other hand, with six legs you have a simpler problem to solve.
You can *always* have a stable tripod of three legs, and thus that much
more time to figure out where to put the other three. You even have a
"fallback" position if the new position doesn\'t work, because you can
shift your weight back to the three not-moved legs if things go wrong.

With four legs, you shift a leg, then start to shift others, but you
are far more "committed" to the move than with six legs.

I don\'t know. I suspect that at least in the early stages, that static
stability would be *worth* the slower speed. *Especially* in rough
terrain.

Well, please recall that we started out talking about powered armor. In
that case the human is doing all the computationaly intensive stuff.
All the suit is doing is providing muscle.

Just remember. Any alarm system can be bypassed. And on something as
valuable as a ship (and it\'s cargo) it\'s generally worth the trouble to
*someone*.

So having an alarm will make it *harder* to break in. But not
impossible. And there\'s always someone who sees an extra fancy alarm
system and figures that it means there\'s something worth stealing! :-)

It just occured to me that you\'d need a license for that transmitter.
And for best results on planet, it\'d be operating on wavelengths that
might be set aside for "local use" (ie regulating and licensing them
may be up to planetary authorities)

On the other hand, jammers are not going to go un-noticed. *Especially*
in a starport. They announce themselves to every receiver in range.
Blocking the transmission by disabling the antenna is far more likely
(and practical).

(I use 5 min gameturns, 1000 km squares and MUCH less sensitive sensors)
Say Bruces figures are based on 30 min turns. You want 1 minute scans:
Simply reduce sensitivity for all sensors by log(SQRT(1/30)). Thats it.

I\'d say one hexside is (1/6)^2 compared to the entire sphere as space
combat is really 3D. Lets say the coverage you want is 1/3 the angular
"area" of the sphere then your sensitivity goes up by log(SQRT(3/1)).

Finally: I know we\'re not playing a wargame but if you\'ve talked your
players into believing that they only get sensordata at the end of each
gameturn increment instead of continously then you should perhaps pay a
little nore attention to the roleplaying aspects instead of turnlengths and
other wargamish aspects:
Captain "Do we have a firing solution to bogey aplha-bravo-002 yet?"
Sensor op "No Sir, we\'re still integrating and well below background noise"
Captain "Blast the noise! Give me a goddamned predicted course so we can
blow that so called noise anomaly into the next sector"
Sensor op "I\'ll see what I can do Sir"

That was what I was afraid of. Either you could have two range tables, one
for passives and one for actives or go with multiplication.

What exactly does "an AEMS-14 has about the same range as a PEMS-14" mean?

Are you saying Traveller have automatic astronomers :)

My take on what sensor ops do is decide on what part of the sky to scan for
how long, what diabolical noise reduction algorithms will be used (most
good rely on certain supposed facts about the signal and that input will
shurely take some experience to master) etc.

The same goes with gunners: They\'re arent frantically tracking their
targets with green crosshairs screaming as they go. They will try to
predict what the target will do during timelag which involves lots of
psionics or lots of skill. I have some problems with Space gunnery being a
separate skill from Sensor op. Space gunners will definately be special
case sensor ops and splitting the skills is akin to having Rifle and Aim as
separate skills.

OK, true, it\'s easy to just make sure you don\'t store "raw" water
in the tanks. Purification will kill a lot of stuff - ok, it\'ll
kill everything. 

However, I still think it might be a bad idea to just land in an
ocean and start sucking. I have one of those ceramic water filters
and it\'s great, yeah, a 1 micron filter (and iodine for the 
smaller stuff) but it\'s also got an intake hose that\'s less than 1 
cm in diameter. With that kinda hose, you\'ll be waiting a long time
to refuel you ship\'s tanks (not to mention that you can only move water 
through a 1 micron filter so fast... personally, I wouldn\'t to try
doing 14 m^3 of it). A starship\'s intake valves are going to be pretty
big and there\'s a good chance that (as Rod described) something
organic is going to get sucked in. A bunch of plankton, shrimp
or a couple of seagulls will gum up that 1 micron filter pretty 
quick. Or, if you just suck \'em in and electrolyse the water,
you may end up getting unplesant "buildup" on the electrodes.
Thermal cracking would probably be the easiest way to deal with 
stuff in the water though.

As for stuff getting "baked in space" on the trip, sure, I\'d agree
that almost everything will be DOA, but there might be a few
single-celled critters that manage to make it, sttuck in some 
crack in one of the scoops... apparently there\'s bacteria inside the
lens of that camera that was left on the moon that would come back to
life quite fine if it was returned to Earth. The chances of something
like this happening are pretty small, but any world that has a lot
of space traffic will have laws to make sure that the chance is zero.
i.e. don\'t land in the water, please.

Also, although I have not yet had the time to verify it, I believe
it\'s "canon" that you can live with unrefined fuel. You don\'t have
to have a fuel purification plant just because you have fuel scoops.
It\'s stupid, sure, but if you were in a hurry (and who isn\'t ?)
you might be tempted to just fill\'er up and jump. It only
takes one tank of bad water to ruin your ecosystem.

Not too good.  It\'s like claiming that World War II didn\'t start until 7
December, 1941.. it ignores all everything that happened in Europe.

The Gulf War started on August 2nd, 1990, with the invasion of Kuwait.

But you\'ll have to store raw water in the tanks or there will be no point
in having fuel scoops larger than what your purification plant can
process. I mean what does a ship do with the 100 dton scooped while it
waits for it to be purified at a rate of 3 dtons per hour. 

Another qusetion is then that the ship has to do several gas giant runs 
to fill up the tanks, or stay in the giants atmosphere for 33 hours in the
example over? It seems to me that this is often forgotten. Most just see
the ship scoops the fuel and purifies it the way to the jump point. That
isn\'t possible.

I think that if you think completely rational, there would be virtually no
piracy. Merchants probably would not risk travelling to unprotected systems,
and pirates would not risk travelling to protected systems. But this is not
my vote.

Since Traveller is a game of fiction, I would prefer to have pirates in it
(I will, regardless of what ya all say, mateys. Arrrh !).

Ship transponder signals could probably be changed if you are good at
electronics, or obtain illegal transmitters from some kind of black market.

Only desperate merchants would want to refuel at gas giants, since there is
a significant risk of pirate activity there. But, on many worlds, refueling
in the oceans is prohibited. So, the captain would have to buy fuel or risk
a trip to the gas giant.

Pirates modus operandi would be something like "stike fast, if that fails,
dissappear" in patrolled systems. In other systems larger ships, or even
small fleets, would be utilized (corsairs carrying a few small fighters).
The freighter ship would probably be carried, and the licence codes and such
would be aquired from the captain in order to sell the ship "legally".

It is in the Imperiums best interest to prevent as much piracy as possible.
They cannot monitor everything, however, so there is always room for a few
luck-seekers :-)

You claim that if the suit is "designed intelligently" it will act as if it
wasn\'t there.  Yet it\'ll allow you to do things you can\'t do without it, like
jump high and use extra strength.  You don\'t get it both ways.  If you stomp
your foot into the ground, is it going to push hard enough to knock you over or
not?  If you want it to require lots of training and concentration to use, the
answer is "yes".  If you don\'t, the answer is "it figures out you don\'t really
want to fall over and \'does the right thing\'".  But you don\'t get it both ways.

Leonard> In what way is learning to move in a powered suit different from

The difference is in the fidelity of response.  As I said before,

> have their own reflexes effectively triggered.

I don\'t think it is (quite) within our tech to get that fidelity, especially on
something which is supposed to be rugged.  I\'ve worked on robots, actuators,
and sensors and think I know what I\'m talking about.


I\'m just going to snip a lot of stuff about re-learning reflexes, and summarize
it as follows:

I believe a suit which cannot "guess" what you\'re trying to do will be
extremely hard to learn to use, and hard to develop reflexes which are integral
enough for combat use.  The reasons are a combination of mental difficulty and
the difficulty of constructing the actual suit with the required force-feedback
response fidelity.  Therefore, I put usable exoskeletons one TL from now, with
combat-usable exoskeletons two TL from now.

You disagree on the issue of how hard it is to retrain reflexes, but haven\'t
stated any position on getting the required force-feedback fidelity or what TL
the suits _will_ exist, relative to "now".  You\'ve just consistently stated
that I\'m wrong.  Fine.  We disagree.

Let\'s take an example which is not "walking".  How about "keeping your
balance while standing".  You keep your balance by applying force to the ground
with your feet.  You can keep your balance the hard way: mimc the leg movements
_precisely_.  Er, um, you don\'t actually move your legs much when you\'re
standing there - you just change the force.  OK, you can balance the hard way:
mimic the force pattern of your feet on the sensors in the suit.

OR, you can keep your balance the easy.  Put a couple of gyroscopes in the
suit.  Now, these could do a _lot_ to make it easy to keep your balance, but
you have no obvious method for the human to control them.  So, for them to be
useful the "suit makes the appropriate" use of the gyroscopes.

This is a single example.  I could construct more. ("how much force to apply" -
grabbing as opposed to crushing an object, for example).



A suit which can interpret what you\'re trying to do and do appropriate things,
within the constraints of it being on you, will be _much_ easier to use.  I
don\'t think it\'ll be combat-capable until it is that easy to use, but you
obviously disagree.  Fine.  We disagree.

I\'m not familiar with the analysis of ant neural nets you repeatedly refer to.
However, I am familiar with the set of reflexes obtained from studying a
cockroach which has a similar result.  The above behavior (smashing into
things, scrambling over them, etc.) is the result.  I have videotape of it,
source from when I made a physically realistic simulation of a cockroach for

"We\'ll end up with" is not early stages.  Yes, in the early stages, walking
robots were 6 legged.  Look at the literature.

Form follows function.  If you want _unstable_ terrain locomotion, you want 6
legs.  Maybe even more.  If you want stable terrain locomotion, statically
stable walking, such as around a house, spaceport, or factory, four legs.  My
experience tells me that they won\'t slip often enough to be a problem.

If you want real rough terrain locomotion, you\'ll be running, which means you
probably want to reduce to four or even two legs, depending on how hard it is
to find footholds.  Running allows you to get over obstacles a statically
stable walker would never be able to manage.

My belief, and I still haven\'t seen data which changes my mind:

When would power-assisted suits exist in Traveller?
Reseach: this TL.
Commercial: next TL (possibly externally powered), for controlled
	circumstances.
Combat: next TL beyond that, for the computational advances necessary to
	make the suit know enough of the environment not to hamper its wearer.
	Possibly further.  Combat suits would require a small portable fusion
	plant - possibly imported from a higher TL to make it smaller.

So, when would walking trucks exist in Traveller?
Commercial: this TL, IF there is a reason to want them.
	Next TL if there isn\'t.  They would walk slowly, 10mph or less, until
	computers can see well enough to find footholds.
Combat: When they can run on rough terrain (same TL as combat power-assisted 
	devices).  Figure out if they\'re needed - the change from wheels
	to legs is pretty drastic, and you\'re throwing away a lot of expertise
	to make it.


You game may vary.

I disagree.  Considering the inhospitable nature of most planets outside
the H zone, and considering that the extended system generation system
can give you substantial populations on these worlds, there must be quite
a bit of intra-system traffic from the mainworld to support these worlds!
Also, binary and trinary systems can have a 2nd and 3rd habitable zone...

One side issue that might be fertile - Traveller Naval doctrine.

What is the difference between a ship designed and deployed for anti piracy
and one designed and deployed for a war that has not yet happened?

Let us assume the usual state of tense peace, in which capital ships are
needed for possible war, but is doing nothing more than showing the flag, a
bit of petty threatening, and so on.

The way my universe\'s doctrine works is:

A fleet will not be taking the usual jumps, so they will need scouts to
survey the path and to find possible enemies.  These range from a few
hundred tons up to a few thousand, because it is generally better to have
two scouts, than one larger scout.

They will need pickets - it is very convenient to be able to say with
certainty that there is nobody within a light second of a certain point.
In real combat, these vessels run, as they are quite fragile.  Typically,
one uses fighters or other short duration craft for this, though they also
might range up to a few hundred tons.  They are likely to be optimized for
a mission, and also likely to be easy to customize by changing weapons
loadouts or crewing.  Put two sensor guys in, and it is a sensor platform,
while with two commo guys, it is a spy, and with two gunners, it is a small
weapons platform.

They will need light vessels which can screen the heavy vessels, add EW
capabilities, and prevent gazillions of fighters or missiles from harassing
the larger vessels.  They are not much good against a decent warship, but
so far outclass any civilian, fighter, or SDB that they are good screening
elements.  These are the destroyers of the world, 5kt-15kt, a crew that
covers all the bases, and fast enough to build that they are the most
common vessel out there.

They will need medium sized vessels which can pin down forces, and which
can keep small fry from entering the fray in a dangerous way.  In addition,
this is the vessel used for force projection in peacetime.  It is not as
expensive to run as a battleship, and is quite capable of taking on many
lower tech foes, as it is a warship.  It is meant to operate without
support in peacetime, or as a "large picket" in wartime.  This is the
domain of the cruiser.  These are in the 20-50 kt range, and have decent
spinal mounts, and has a complete crew.  Any task which needs to be
accomplished can generally be accomplished by a cruiser without special
loadouts and crews.

They will need heavy vessels which can deliver the required punch, and
which can smash the equivalents from the other side.  These are what you
send against a fortified world.  They are fantastically big, and
fantastically dangerous.  They take a long time to build, and tend to be
both the hammer and the anvil.  Their spinal mounts are amazing, and the
fire control capabilities are unmatched, as a ship like this can easily
afford a dedicated individual for any conceivable task, and a whole staff
of them for any important task.

The weakness - they are very expensive and time consuming to build, so the
fleets will want to keep them safe when they are not needed.  Further, they
will protect them well, so that the enemy cannot hit them hard.

In my world, this is taken care of on several levels.  Because it takes a
long time to build BB and CA vessels, the navy concentrates on destroyers
during peacetime, while leaving the BB class vessels mostly docked at a
depot waiting for hostilities to begin.  Moving a CA somewhere is often
seen as a diplomatic maneuver, while a DD is ubiquitous.

To most players, DDs are the Navy.  In many ways, they are to the Navy as
well.  Where else can you give your young officers potential combat
experience, training, and command/planning experience without actual warfare?

Given the ease of construction and the cost, I would bet that there are an
awful lot of destroyers steaming about that can settle the hash of most
people making trouble of any kind.

This can be fixed, BTW, by simply making combat possible in jumpspace, or
boosting the drive capabilities such that combat happens far away.  A dozen
ships can patrol the 100d limit of a typical size 9 world, because the
sensors can spot any hostiles, and weapons work at very long ranges.  If
the limit were a thousand diameters, then there would be a thousand times
as much space to cover, and hundreds of ships would be needed.

Yes it is.  You may only allocate .2% of the total budget, but you _apply_
it equally everywhere.  You contend that a Starport E, Pop-3, TL-5 world
will be just as secure for a merchant as a Starport A, Pop-A, TL-F world.

I\'ve never said that independant pirates go after corporate ships, tho\'
corporate raiders may. That would be suicidal.  You may get one Tukera
Liner, but then what?  Sooner or later they will get you.  Scout ships,
OTOH, disappear all the time.  200-500 ton merchant ships, independant or
subbies, don\'t have that kind of protection.

The most powerful Navy (of the time) didn\'t have the (gasp) resources to
protect it\'s merchant fleet?  Or rather, they were not willing to disperse
the resources and leave themselves vulnerable?

Why who would have thought of that...  ;)

I\'m going to concentrate my fleet, because there ain\'t no way in hell that
I\'ll have that many ships unless the opposition has a formidable fleet as
well.  If I split them to cover the worlds, I invite defeat by detail.
That means I\'ll lose the subsector.  

I\'ll have pickets out and running, but the bulk of those pickets will be
silent, and far out from the mainworld.  If something does happen, I don\'t
want my picket to be caught in a gravity well.  It just has to be able to
monitor system traffic, and run if necessary.

So, by straight numbers, you are correct.  But, in Traveller we are trying
to bring more than straight numbers to bear.  By straight numbers, the
U.S. can field an incredible military force.  We have demonstrated the
ability to crank out ships and put a significant portion of our population
in uniform and on the field.  In reality, it is very difficult to justify
that kind of expense going to defense, unless there is a real and
compelling reason.  (For us, it usually means someone is shooting at us,
RIGHT NOW.  Even then, there are those who chose to argue...)

I don\'t think that is very different anywhere in the world, is it?

So why will the Imperium be different?  So what if the numbers say that
they can produce 222 Tigresses, how many capital ships are necessary to
defend against a Zho invasion.  Well, not defend, hold until
reinforcements can arrive? (the psuedo history of the frontier wars seems
to support this as the defensive policy for the Spinward Marches...) How
many are needed to defend against an Aslan invasion.  Oh, they are our
friends aren\'t they...don\'t plan for that.  How many to hold the Sword
Worlds...with their _one_ Class A starport, they aren\'t much of a threat.
How about the Vargr?  That\'s easy, just keep them fighting among
themselves...

So the _numbers_ say yes, it is possible.  The implied threat, the
motivating force behind a massive military buildup, just isn\'t (IMHO)
there.

I guess what I am saying is that TCS is a great system for playing
interstellar war.  But it is optimized for fleet production for war, not
for long term play.  I\'m not sure that the numbers there work particularly
well for Traveller as a whole.  (Oh, that\'s going to open a can of
worms...where did I put the flame-proof suit??)

First you give me a historical example of a city that was able to support
500 times as many full-time militia-men as it has street corners for any
length of time.

When it takes weeks, even months, to communicate to the loan source and
get an answer, how do you keep the record current?  If I fire the captain
of my Subbie, am I not allowed to keep her moving with a new Captain?
Even in my campaign, where all ship\'s records are kept at the S/Sector
capitol, it still takes 2-6 weeks to get a courier there and back,
assuming that the record has been transferred there if the ship is working
out-of-subsector.  And how about ships with Sword World registries?

(sigh) let me give you a few ideas...
1) Make a \'friend\' in traffic control (large sums of credit will buy you
very, very good friends...)  He/she/it can slip you flight plans (which,
when properly examined will give you a close approximation of jump and
break out points).

2) Get a crewman with good computer skill and have him reverse engineer
the \'generate\' program.  Use this to determine likely breakout points
given specific jump points.

3) Pose as a trader and identify a particularly rich cargo.  Keep tabs on
that cargo and find out who buys it, and where they plan to transship it.
Use (2) to determine the most likely ambush site...

4) Call a likely target ship and inquire as to where they are going, and
if they have cargo/passenger space.  

5) Read the starport news and find out what ships are advertising for what
planets, figure out which would be the most likely target.

6) Hire a ship to carry cargo, booby trap the cargo.  (I _liked_ the robot
in the crate story...)

7) Put insiders on the victim (either passengers or \'working passage\',
ready to assist at the right time...

And these are just the \'jump ship\' tactics...

Not if you are looking at CT or MT rules.  Go and read the Vacc Suit
defintion in those editions.  It states that BattleDress is just an
armored form of Vac Suit, and your skill in Vac Suit can be used as
BattleDress with no penalty.

Check the Traveller Book.  Check the MT Player\'s Manual.

BattleDress, on the other hand, can be used as Vac Suit at a -1 penalty,
thus if you have Vac Suit-3, you\'ve also got BattleDress-3;  but, if
you\'ve got BattleDress-3, you\'ve got Vac Suit-2.

I\'m not kidding.  Check it out.

Leaving aside the issue of wether the Imperium _can_ make transponders
effective (and I have grave doubts), I think there is broader
issue that keeps arising that needs to be addressed...

What I see as one of the most common mistakes on this list is that
assumption that if anything the Imperium gains any benefit from
will be done.  This is not how the real world works.  Every
large organization has a vast array of useful things and they
are always forced to pick and choose.

Thus, it is not sufficient to show that the Imperium "could" do
something if one payed no attention to costs.  The first step
needs to be that what one proposes is cheaper than the alternatives,
ie the benefits of transponders have to exceed their cost _and_
exceed the benefits of anything else that might be done with those
resources.  You can\'t simply look at one issue in isolation and
come up with a difinative answer, this, IMO, leads to a view of
an Imperium that is nigh omnipotent and omniscient.  The fact
is that, if you have an Empire that spans communication times
of over year it is going to have be a distant government, not
a government that is easily commiting resources to solve every
problem in every corner of the Empire regardless of the cost.

Under canon rules, nowhere that the Navy has any power at all.  This leaves
places where a Naval commander has taken a bribe, or been driven away.
Because of the tremendous number of ships out there, it is unlikely that
piracy would happen.

To fix this, come up with more places for pirates to lurk, and Navy ships
to go.  Alternatively, make Navy ships ten or a hundred times as expensive
as merchant ships, as then there are fewer of them.

Canon - difficult.  Reality - it could not be that difficult, but you can

I play it that a transponder is very hard to duplicate, simply because of
the small number of ships out there to track.  If a few ships can cover a
world, then the 350 ships a pop A world can produce out of pocket change is
a enough to stop piracy cold.  On the other hand, 350,000 hull paints and
signatures covers the entire registry, and is well within the capacity of a
high end database server today, assuming a megabyte of data per ship.

My universe - high but insufficient.

I suspect that the ship registry includes a picture and bio data on the
current captain.  If the locals have any reason to be suspicious of them,
then they would go to greater efforts, which might include a complete crew
roster.

Your transponder also includes a hull paint scan return.  This can be faked
if your ship is a similar class, and you take the time to obscure it, but
it can be rather difficult and expensive to do.  Further, a signature
change will get the Navy\'s attention, so you would run as one, then as
another after a noticeable downtime.  This is worth doing after a hit, but
not something you can change on dropping into a system.

If you have support of powerful people, they can assign you a brand new
registry number with a very similar signature to your own.  If you turn
pirate, people will start to wonder, and may well fall upon the original
person like a ton of bricks.  So again, it is not impossible, but it is
difficult.

Agreed.  The hull paint sensor return and the emissions signature is the
tough one, and one that is a constant cat and mouse game between the
pirates with the money, and the Navies with the training.  Even if you know
what to change, which the pirates would, it is difficult and expensive.

True enough, when combined with incompetent or sleazy officials.  It is
still very, very hard to pirate if they can see you do it, so I have been
trying to find a good way to make it possible for people to come upon the
wreckage without getting a view of the combat itself.

This is very, very difficult to do in present day surface craft.

Why limit yourself to the neutrino signature?  I believe the primary ID
used in Bruce\'s system is IR.  You can fiddle with the IR to some extent,
but significant changes in signature involve significant changes in hardware.

More correctly, my point is based on two premises:  One, you can track and
ID a ship successfully standard sensors of the type traffic control will
have, including neutrino, IR, radio, microwave, and visible, out to the
hundred diameter limit.  Two, the signature is very hard to change, based
on our experiences with sonar and submarine.  Admittedly, this may be
completely irrelevant, but the EMS sensors we have today are very
sensitive, we have good filtering algorithms to find unique points, and
even if some parts of the signature can be changed, there will likely be
sample variations that are not going to be easy to alter in a convincing way.

Agreed.  If there are places the defenders and their cameras are not, then
this objection goes away.

Possible, but how much of a radio does it take to send a "Signal GK?"  Note
also that you cannot easily jam if you are in easy sensor range, as then
traffic control will see you.

Sure, you could run, but there are limits.  If you are connected with an
act of piracy, we are not talking a seriously difficult problem to get your
signature out to all of the Naval units eventually.  As long as you stayed
ahead of the data dumps, you could run for a while, but they would be
interested in you and your ship.  As far as the signature change, see below.

Note: military ships are cheap.  A picket costs roughly twice what a ship
of similar size does.  If you assume jump pickets that are triple the size
of the average merchant, then losing six ships justifies one picket
completely.

Earth is a different case - our military ships are much, much more
expensive than commercial ships by factors of 20-100.

It is not a moment, I suspect, based on modern results.

And the Navy can ID a given ship via sonar exactly, not by type, but
exactly, if it is within range.  Since Naval sensors are only good out to
10 miles for this kind of task, it is easy to slip by - there are not that
many attack subs out there.  Further, the data needed to ID a ship in the
modern navy fits, by arguments about capacity, in under 1K.  (I presume
they are using some kind of time evolving FFT, but this I do not know.
This would give them 100-300 FFT coefficients, which should be enough for a
good match.)

Since getting signatures on the thousands of ships out there would only be
a few megabytes, it is certainly possible for the Navy to put a computer
with all the signatures on every ship.  They do not, because the sensors
are not as useful in general, and they are not likely enough to be in range
for it to matter.  In Traveller, on the other hand, every A or B port and
every vessel has the sensors needed, so it is only a question of the talent
of the person doing the scan.

In Traveller, since the ports are in sensor range of the jump limit, they
are going to be in range, and the number of ships is out of line.  It seems
unlikely that there are more than 3600 ships a world, on average, so 3.6
megabytes of data for each byte that a full ship ID takes.  Assuming a
megabyte for signature, or 2-3 orders of magnitude more data than a
positive sonar ID today, and more than many intensive stellar surveys have
garnered on items of great interest after much scanning, you are still
talking under ten terabytes.  This would be a thousand bucks of storage
today.  The astronomer types I know assert that you can get an awfully good
signature on something in just a few K.

To change signatures such that the old ones fail apparently takes a major
shipyard some time in the modern world.

It is open to question whether the radiation from a Traveller ship has the
same properties, but the signal analysis astronomy types I know do not see
significant differences in the underlying difficulty.  Both are hard
problems, but both should produce similar data.

Big difference - if there were only 300,000 cars in the world, and there
were ID posts at every gas station that could positively ID a vehicle, then
doing anything illegal within sight of a gas station would give things
away, even if you could outrun the law and change the signature after the act.

They will know what vehicle committed the crime, because they saw it come
in, and each port, at least, will have a list of all cars in existence as
of the last update.  Yes, you can claim to be a new vessel, but then you
will suffer intensive scrutiny.  Sure, you can bribe or talk your way past
it much of the time, but there may well be times you cannot, and then you
had better be clean.

This is why piracy requires anonymity, and the only way to have anonymity
in Traveller with reasonable sensors is to be out of range of the sensors
at the ports when you do your heinous act, such that they do not know who
did it.

As long as none of the back history helps them find you.  After all, they
can ID your vehicle absolutely.  With modern crime, they cannot ID you at
the scene, so repainting the car is sufficient.  Further, the car is cheap,
so once you get away, you can lose the car.  Ships cost, so they cannot as
easily be lost.

Yep.  The latter is the part that bothers me.  I am considering trying a
"jump routes" deal where traffic had a relatively small number of routes,
but where the total length precluded patrolling.

Drosnin states this:

"The Old Testament has been a settled text for at least a thousand
years.  The Torah has not changed in that time, and no scholar would
question that.  There is a complete version from 1008 AD (The Leningrad
Codex), and every Hebrew Bible that now exists is the same letter for
letter.  So the text used in the computer program--the one in which I
found the exact date of the collision of the comet with Jupiter;  July
16, 1994--has not changed in at least a thousand years."

	No, you don\'t pull 1G with the attitude control thrusters. You use them to
reorient the ship in a few seconds, and then pull 1G with the thrust plates.

	Actually, it\'s just like steering the QE -- you use the rudder to change

I agree with you Anders. Gunnery, in Traveller terms, is mostly a Sensor
Operation involving getting FC locks from the data the Sensor Operator
hands off to them and using their experience and intuition to determine
just how to get those weapon locks.

I don\'t think it is a *low* automation job, like some people seem to

	No, this is the dramatical centerpiece of a television drama that
frequently sacrifices logic, realism, consistency and even common sense to
match what the current episode\'s writer wants to happen.

   Hans applies it equally everywhere because that miniscule 0.2% is more
   than adequate to stop piracy EVERYWHERE.  Why not stop piracy
   everywhere if you have more the resources to do it very easily?

   If Tukera is strong enough to defend its ships and still make a
   profit, then the Imperium should have no problem whatsoever protecting
   its citizens without taxing them very hard.

   Well, Britain may not have had the resources to patrol the whole
   world, but the Imperium CERTAINLY has the resources to patrol each
   starport and the important space around it.  And they still have
   99.8% of their resources undispersed with what\'s left over.

   You miss the point.  No massive military buildup is necessary.  A mere
   0.2% of the naval budget is sufficient to patrol every world.  If you
   believe that the naval budget is a little too large (as I do), then
   OK, slash it by a factor of 10!  Then you\'ll need a whopping 2%
   (1/50th) of the new (miniscule) naval budget to eliminate piracy!
   
   Let me re-iterate this point, since you seem to think that stopping
   piracy will be some kind of arduous or expensive task.  Spending
   0.2% of the naval budget is EASY.  The US navy spends more than that
   on environmental restoration alone!  On base closures alone! On
   procurement of ammunition alone!  And yet the US economy or political
   will does not shudder under these burdens.

   No can of worms at all.  In fact, the numbers there do not work to
   better than a factor of 2.  But even if they were too large by a
   factor of 10 as I pointed out above, or even by a factor of 100, the 
   Imperium could still easily eliminate piracy in its borders.

   There is no historical example, which is exactly why you cannot
   rationally point to the existence of crime on the street as an analog
   for piracy in the Imperium.  No situation remotely like jump travel in
   the imperium has ever existed in history.

The only real point I disagree with you is the comparison of the Gunner
and Sensor Operator\'s jobs.  The Sensor Operator is taking the big picture
and defining it.  The SO will be taking the filtered sensor data (the
computer gets first crack at it, although, in some cases the SO may look
at the raw data to check for spoofing), interpret it, setting priorities,  
and passing it to the workstations (Nav, MFD, ect...) that need to use it.

The gunner will be concentrating on taking the targets the SO identifies
and refining a Fire Control solution.  By removing the SO from the
picture, you will reduce the gunners ability to concentrate on the
specific targets (what the gunner needs to do) by making him have to
interpret the whole picture and pick out targets and select priorities.

Refinements in computers and sensors will make it easier to automate
either job, but only under normal circumstances.  Add any kind of
serious unusual or artificial confusion to the sensor plot, and, IMHO,
the computer will not be able to interpret the picture.

Ships with Advanced or Extreme IR Masking have a little leeway to 
change their IR signature. Almost all the IR comes from the radiators, and
ships with upgraded masking have extra/redundant/high-capacity radiators
all over the hull. They can (for example) chose not to use the masking
and run with the signature of an unmasked ship - andpossibly to vary what
sort of unmasked ship they appear like. Still, that\'ll only fool someone
for a turn or two.

Sooner or later there will be rules for using passive jammers to 
do exotic deceptive things like appearing as a different class of ship...
but those will almost always work only against lower-tech-level sensors.
(Something like "fooling a passive sensor one TL lower is an Impossible
task, +1 DM for each extra tech level the jammer exceeds the sensor.)

	I think this is the crux of the thread.  The way this could be 
resolved, if it can be, is for Douglas to tell us what level of naval 
spending he would consider reasonable and not "a massive military 
buildup."  If Hans can show that less than 1% of that budget would be 
all that\'s required to stamp out piracy, we\'ll consider the 
"insufficient resources" part of the argument finished.  Douglas and 
others are free to argue that the Imperium wouldn\'t distribute these 
anti-piracy forces in an equitable manner or bring up other reasons why 
piracy would still exist, but no one would be able to credibly say that 
the resources were lacking, only the will.
	Hans, Douglas, what do you say?  Sound fair?

I tell the pilot to use his judgement, which often means rolling
an uncertain (MT) task to see if he thinks its safe. Something like
this:

	To determine if the ground is safe to land on:
	Routine, Pilot, Int (uncertain)
	Referee: Increase difficulty by one level if the ground
	cannot be observed directly due to clouds, vegetation
	or other reasons. Increase difficulty by one level if the 
	ship is	larger than 1000 tons. Increase by two levels if
  	the ship is larger than 10,000 tons.

That\'s just off the top of my head and could bear some tweaking.

As I mentioned in a post yesterday, I have starships land/lift from
water, and it\'s for this very reason. 

Of course, if you keep your CG modules running, and your effective
weight down to almost nothing, you can put your ship down on a thin
sheet of ice or in the middle of bog.  Just don\'t turn the CG\'s off! ;->

giving permission to open up an art gallery in Freelance
Traveller.  And yes, he has permission to be snarky at me if
that\'s why he sent them in the first place.  Art like this does
not admit of an excuse for not exhibiting it.

I seem to recall that Chris Cox is also a prime Traveller artist.
I\'d have no reason to object if he decided that he had some
exhibitable work as well.

	Douglas, I\'ll grant you all that.  I\'ll grant you complete and 
total knowledge of the destination and cargo of all ships in the system.  
I\'ll grant you GG refueling.  Whatever you want.  But you still haven\'t 
addressed the points I was making. Namely, that the presence of a single 
SDB makes piracy untenable.  And, that even in the absence of SDBs, the 
presence of armed merchants makes capturing the target rather expensive 
and therefore not a winning proposition economically.
	This is not to say that piracy is totally impossible, only that 
it can only occur under a highly restrictive set of circumstances:

	(1) absence of SDBs
	(2) superior arms on the part of pirates

	And let me reiterate, at 1% of GDP for Naval spending, even 
150,000 people can support an SDB.  So condition (1) will hold only in 
_really_ small systems, and how much trade do they generate?  Besides, if 
they\'re that small a settelment and they have no space defenses, you 
could just hold the entire population hostage by threatening to drop 
rocks on them until they hand over all their wealth in some portable form.
	(2) Is important because if the pirate and merchant are equally 
matched then the merchant has as much chance of disabling the pirate as 
the pirate has of disabling the merchant!

	If you want pirates because you think pirates are fun, then 
okay.  But the Trav universe simply does not allow for economically 
viable pirates, and its that position that I am arguing with.

IR output of ships is going to be similar to begin with,
the output of ships of the same type is going to be
the same.

Well, even if detection at the 100 diam limit is possbile, you
still don\'t have the level of indentification you desire.  You
example of sonar is a good one.  Sonar gives you the type
of ship, but if I took a merchant ship and armed it for piracy
sonar won\'t let you know.  Also, it is ill suited to identifing
a specific ship and even if you could changing the signature would
require a few minute at the propellar and a file.

Actually, you just jam at the time of attack and then you

Well, you are going to need something the size a Kunuir since
a small ship can be ganged up on and suprised.  If you take a
ship out by suprise (which can be seconds, but lets assume
it takes a full 5 minute) and then 15 minutes to transfer
cargo, you need a response time of 20 min.  This will require
multiple ships and those ships will need to be spelled (another
poster mentioned that US ships spend 30% of their time at sea
so maybe we can figure that there are three shifts).  So
maybe 18 Kunuir sized vessels (6 posts in three shifts) will
guard a world.  At that rate you are going to see the major
systems, and the main worlds in middle sized systems, protected
and other places are going to be iffy.

This is no my understanding of Naval capabilities at all.
[But I know some ex submarine people on another list, I\'ll
check...]
In any case, the ID is not a fixed as you would make it.  All you
need to do is give the engine a tune up and make trivial
changes to the propellar and you have a new signature.

[STuff about storing signatures...]
If you can get a signature is won\'t matter.  You won\'t see
it again.  He will just move on and change it on another
world.

The background is inconsitent.  You have exploritory
ships with auxilary vehicles to get to the surface
and the fact that the Imperium has gone to the trouble
to blast at least a level rock surface on every system
in the entire Empire (ie type "X" is the lowest class
port for a world).  OTOH, if you look at the rules there
is no clear reason why a ship couldn\'t land anyplace open.

In my campiagn, a ship landing on anything other than
rock kicks up a lot of debris (but then I don\'t use
thruster plates, my reactionless thrusters have
exhaust) and, since star ships weight a lot, there
is some chance that the ground may not support one
or more of the struts (so they at least sink in)
complicating landing.  This causes the landing to
have a fairly small, but real, risk of going wrong.
Thus, you hit the "port" (ie the level bit of rock)
if you can, otherwise you land else where.

    'body' => '>1) the existence & dwelling places of piracy in the Imperium

I think that Piracy would exist in the Imperium, as I\'ve stated, usually
rather vehemently.  Major places it would exist?  Spinward Marches, Coreward
Edge of the Imperium (towards the Vargr Extants), around Reaver\'s Deep area
(and all along the Solomani Rim for that matter).

I am mostly against the "piracy can only work if its an act of war" argument,
because I don\'t think that its true.

>2) the ability & ease in changing ship transponder signals

I think this is entirely possible (I think it is foolish to think otherwise).
 But, it is something that would be relatively difficult to do, or somewhat
expensive to have done by someone else.

>3) the frequency of GG refueling visits

I haven\'t made up my mind on this one yet.  There are a number of things (GG
refueling vs. Starport refueling, "Standard" Life Support vs. Closed Loop
Life Support) that make little sense in the Traveller Universe in my opinion.

>4) T4 pirates\' modus operandi

T4 meaning Milieux: 0?  There\'d be tons of pirates.  Lots of them, until the
3I says: "ENOUGH!" And starts slaughtering them.

>5) level of effort by the Imperium to control piracy

This depends on the amount of funds that the Imperium has to spend on its
whole Navy to begin with.  Until I get through my crash course in
Macroeconomics I refuse to comment further :)

This would surely only effect metabolism.  The effects of rubbing

I\'m also not convinced of the duration effect - 1 week into 3 hours
seems very severe (get this into the drinking supply of your target and
just walk in and around the people - they won\'t even see you.

There was slow, medical slow and fast.  Whhich I though was x2 for slow
(i.e. the world goes slower - you go faster), x 30 for Medical Slow (but
your unconcious (handy for healing - you\'d need a very grunty drip feed

There is a story told here about Humphry the Bear. Sort of like Barney,
he\'s been around for many years. The story goes that one day during an
event in a park a bee flew into the head through the eye holes. The
children were treated to the sight of Humphry ripping of his head and
kicking around the park.

There\'s an excellent short story about this by Asimov??? about men
living on mars being charged exhorbitant amounts for the water used to
propell rockets about because of politicians on earth not knowing the
figures and rationing.

Anyways - these mars dwellers (or maybe asteroid miners - I read it a
while ago) go to Saturn and grab a chuck of ice from orbit there and
bring it back.

Last line of the story goes something like.

"And if earth is so concerned about running out of water.  Don\'t worry
we can sell you all the water you want."

An ommision from FF&S2 is that Intensity should never exceed Discharge

I see you multipled Input Energy by number of laps to get Input Energy per
Shot.  It is being discused on the GDW-Beta list whether Input Energy per
Shot should be DE x 10 (as it currently is in FF&S2) or DE x 10 x #laps.  If
you just used FF&S2 as is Input Energy per Shot should be 1727.  Also Power
Required seems off.  Power Required should be (ROF3/min x 1727MJ x7laps
/60sec) = 604.45MW.  FF&S2 seems to have an error in its Power Requires
eqauation currently it reads: "Power required is Rate of Fire x Energy Per
Lap x Number of Laps per Shot / Length of Turn)".  I beleive it should read:
"Power required is Rate of Fire x 10 x Energy Per Lap x Number of Laps per
Shot /
Length of Turn)".                ^^^^

Unfortunately I think that accumulators are also incorrect.  TL-14

Ahh - But it takes time to pump on water and scoop up hydrogen - This
time also includes the time spebnd producing unrefined fuel from the raw
material and dumpiing the unused molecules (such as oxygen).  Then the
hydrogen is refined into exactly perfect Jump Fuel.  Power plants get by
on unrefined fuel (not water, nor ammonium/hydrogen mixes or whatever is
scooped).

IMHO - What the scoops do is take in whatever you scoop up (or pump) and
turn it into unrefined fuel (the equipment to do this is subsumed into
the powerplant and stuff (as the process is very simple perhaps) and so
while thrusting to the jump diameter you can turn the unrefined ( but
still liquid hydrogeny) fuel into refined fuel (perhaps refined fuel is
just all facing the right way or is zero tolerance for Impurities).

How does the "Sensors" skill interact with the technology of the sensors

information provided numerically), most unskilled individuals can pick a

bearing (passive sensors might be a bit harder).  IOW, the equipment itself
provides much of the "skill".  To what affect does a character\'s sensor
skill improve one\'s chances when using ship\'s sensors?

This may sound like a stupid question, but I am just interested in a few
examples as to how two people with different skill ratings-- looking at the
same sensor display-- can acquire different levels of information.

Jamming and passive sensors, OTOH, are a different story.

They use the same technique when filming the current live-action kids show
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles".  They insert a modified hair dryer (with
the heating elements removed) in through the mouth to provide cool air to
the actor inside.  Of course, if the animatronics guy is out having a
smoke, there\'s no one around to open the mouth (it happened more than
once-- "I can\'t breathe... open the mouth... OPEN the mouth!").

	FF&S2 treats HEAP and HE identically for damage calculations; I\'d
treat HE as being no more effective than slug against armour, and HEAP as
being no more effective than slug against unarmoured targets.

	As far as hollowpoints go, the damage resolution in Trav is just
too coarse to reflect any advantage, AFAIK.

	Been thinking about the design today, and I realized that I was
making the assumption that x joules worth of rocket exhaust will produce
the same velocity as x joules produced by chambered propellant detonating
in a gun.  I\'d be inclined to subtract a die\'s worth of damage from each
range to reflect the (AFAIK) less efficient means of propulsion.

Anything that happens to an actor playing "the purple abomination" is
deserved! :-)

Seriously, back in the *60s* they came up with a self contained cooling
suit for race car drivers. It\'s essentially a bodysuit with small
plastic tubes woven into it. A small waist pack pumps water thru the
tubes. The cooling is supplied by filling the waist pack (about the
size of a larger fanny pack) with ice. 

The guy who tested it for an article in Popular Science wore it in a
steam bath for 30 minutes or so. 

They are expensive, but not *that expensive. Thopugh it\'s possible that
they movie folks haven\'t discovered them yet (though I find that
unlikely, given that many stunt men are involved with racing)

They didn\'t. The scenes that were shot in Tunisia were a *real* bear. I
recall reading that they had problems with parts of the C3PO outfit
*melting* in the heat. And that was while the poor actor was *wearing* it.

You\'ll notice that there are *no* desert scenes in the first movie
where a shot lasts more than a minute or so. All those camera cuts are
so that they could us *short* "takes".

Neutrino sensors will give a "count rate" (intensity) and a direction.
The directional info is going to depend greatly on the count rate (it\'s
easier to get a direction of a source that\'s sending out lots of
neutrinos). It\'s also going to depend on how well you can
directionalize the signals. This has to invlove either sheilding (which
means the source could use sheilding) or directionally sensitive
sensors (ie they only react to neutrinos moving thru in a specific
direction, sort of like a directional loop radio antenna). The count
rate depends greatly on what percentage of neutrinos can be detected,
and also on the energy sensitivity (neutrinos have varying energies,
and low energy ones will be harder to detect).

Gravity sensors (as opposed to grvity *wave* detectors) essentially
sense density differences. With multiple srensors (or reading taken
from several different points) you get an idea of the mass involved,
and can "map" the density patterns. 

In space, they have a easier job in that you are looking for dense
objects (ships, rocks, iceballs) surrounded by vacuum. That\'s a pretty
sharp density discontinuity. At the same time, since gravity is a quite
weak source, they work much better at shorter ranges.

If someone knows where to get operational info on the Forward Mass
Detector (a real device), it\'d really help the folks writing the sensor
rules!

I think pirates are unlikely/rare. 

In all of SF I can think of three situations where piracy was occuring
in a plausible manner.

1. Heinlein\'s "Citizen of the Galaxy".
   The pirates are capturing free traders and small merchants. They are
   selling the cargos (and crews!) in another government\'s area. That
   government doesn\'t "support" the pirates. That is, it doesn\'t give
   them ships, and it doesn\'t supply them crews. But it does fuel and
   repair them (at normal rates). And it certainly isn\'t trying to
   *stop* them. But even though it might let them get away with
   refitting a captured ship and re-registering it, they likely
   wouldn\'t tolerate raids on *their* ships.
2. Some of Andre Norton\'s stories.
   This appears to be a case of opirates operating in areas outside
   those controlled by the big interstellar powers. And there\'s also
   the Theives Guild, which has people almost everywhere, and even has
   its own *ports* on worlds not known to the government. The guild
   doesn\'t have pirates as members, but they\'ll cheerfully sell them
   services and buy their loot.
3. E.E.(Doc) Smith\'s "Lensman" stories.
   Here we have "pirates" that are actually "commerce raiders" from
   another "government". Boskone is an autocracy, and they don\'t much
   care what you do as long as you get the job done. They see nothing
   wrong with drug-running, slavery, and other such thing (think of
   them as the Mafia grown big enough to *be* a government).

Case 1 is only applicable on the fringes of the Imperium. Case 2 is
applicable a bit farther into the Imperium, but still relies on there
being unexplored areas or some other way to cheaply have "hidden" bases.
Case 3 could apply all through the Imperium, but only because the
"pirates", being agents of a real government, have enough resources to
*create* complete hidden starports even inside the Imperium.

Note that Case 3 isn\'t really "pirates". But they\'ll be called that
until it eventually becomes obvious that what is really going on is a
war of attrition.

I am sort of surprised.  I really did mean the World detailing systems, not
system generating systems.  Most of the other supposedly habitable worlds
turn out to be absoloutely freezing or roasting, even those in the Habitable
system.  Most habitable zones around M class stars seem not to be.  Of
course this only goes for worlds in the unmodified system generation, I
think that if you use some of the modified versions you get planets which
when listed as habitable, turn out to be so, but you also get less habitable
worlds.  Mind you, I have not calculated any statistics  about this.  Any ideas?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[snip]

	I have to disagree with this assertion.

	Let\'s take a look at the Solar system.  Let\'s assume it\'s a typical
system.  Leaving out the Oort Cloud and Kuiper belts, and just measuring
from the Sun to Pluto\'s aphelion, we get a sphere with a radius of 49.3
A.U, or 4,584,900,000 miles, or 7,378,479,570 kilometers.  Its diameter is
1.475696*10e10 kilometers.  Light takes over 13.5 _hours_ to travel cross
it.

	Its volume is 1.682632*10e30 cubic kilometers.  That\'s a lot of
room.  It\'s the kind of number that makes Carl Sagan want to take two
Tylenol and go lie down for a while.  It\'s far to vast for me to even begin
comprehending.

	However, most of that is waste space; the valuable real estate and
hence all the action is down in the plane of the ecliptic.  So let\'s
calculate the volume of a disk 10% of an A.U. thick, i.e. 9,300,000 miles
or 14,966,490 km thick.  This gives us a volume of only 2.559786*10e27
cubic kilometers, spread out in a disk that\'s about 1:99.6 height to
diameter.

	However, for the Solar system, even some of this is waste space.
Let\'s assume that nothing outside the orbit of Saturn or inside the orbit
of Mercury is going to be visited often (and I\'m leaving out two gas
giants, a small planet, and a raft of moons here).  Thus, we subtract
1.577363*10e23 cubic kilometers from the space inside of Mercury\'s orbit,
giving us 2.559628*10e27 left over, minus 2.463954*10e27 for the space
outside Saturn\'s orbit, which leaves us with 9.5674*10e25 cubic kilometers
worth of prime space in the system.

	This is significantly smaller than the spherical volume of the
Solar system.  Carl could probably hack it, and the fact that I\'m still
standing is a testament to my inability to grok huge numbers.

	Now, let\'s take an SDB.  Let\'s take a hypothetical Famille Spofulam
SDB from hell.  One with a horking great big spinally mounted PA gun with
an 80 light-second range (the maximum T4 space combat range band), that
does 12 G\'s (double the canonical max acceleration for Thruster plates;
maybe it\'s got some big HEPlaR auxiliary drives as well.  And lots of
reaction mass.  LOTS of reaction mass).

	Its effective radius is therefore a sphere 160 light-seconds in
diameter, which gives us a volume of 1.130973*10e17 cubic kilometers.
Anything within 24,000,000 kilometers, that ship can hit.  It\'s a pretty
frightening ship.

	Now, let\'s calculate its effective radius given 24 hours warning;
let\'s say that an allowable elapsed time from a GK signal to the SDB
charging in with PA gun blazing is 24 full hours; the local pirates are all
Slow Drug addicts aside from the being the usual alcohol and Drug Drug
addicts.

	At 12 G\'s, from rest, the SDB will travel 2.239488*10e10 m,
assuming turnaround, or double that (4.478976*10e10 m, or 44,789,760 km) if
the captain is a total maniac and floors it all the way to the scene of the
crime and then begins decelerating.  Bear in mind that this is doing 9 g\'s
over the maximum that TL-12 inertial compensators can compensate for.  Even
if the crew are in G-tanks, they\'re still having a really rough 24 hours.
(note; this is based on the travel formulae in the T4 manual; the numbers
may therefore be slightly porked).

	So basically, the SDB has an effective response radius, assuming 12
G\'s, and crew effectiveness while pulling 9G\'s for 24 hours, of 68,789,760
km.  Which is pretty scary, and way, way beyond what canonical SDB\'s are
capable of.

	The effective volume of space this souped-up psycho-killer SDB from
hell can defend, even allowing it 24 hours response time, is a sphere
137,579,520 km in diameter, with a volume of 1.363515*10e24.


	This is 0.01425168, or slightly less than 1.5%, of the system\'s
"prime real estate".  If we compare radii, the radius of the prime real
estate (i.e. from Sol to Saturn\'s orbit) is 1,427,803,146 km, which is
20.75 times the effective 24 hour response radius of our hypothetical
monster SDB.

	I should note that given jump drives and 100-diameter limits, the
sum of the really prime real estate, the volume of space inside safe jump
radius of each planet , will be infinitesimal compared to the volume of the
system as a whole.  However, the SDB still has to get around inside the
system.  It can only defend one planet at a time, two for a small portion
of any local year if the orbits are spaced right.

	Therefore, I sincerely doubt that a single SDB will suffice to
defend a given system.

	Recall what one prominent pre-WWII air strategist had to say...

	"The sky is too large to defend"

	The same goes for space.  Space is _BIG_.  The scale that the game
takes place on, and it\'s reference to jump "points", and the fact that most
people (myself included) don\'t really bother trying to conceptualize the
scale of things while roleplaying, tends to make us forget this.

Hmmm.  In our deck plans, the fuel scoops lead right into...the
purification plant!

Sombody cutting in from there would need a lot of power and be able to
cut through these massive pieces of machinery.

Besides, I wonder want it would take to cut through the hull like that. 
I guess I\'ll have to pull out my CSC and check on what it takes to cut
through superdense.

Look everybody, I\'m not a proponent of the Bible Code, I\'m just reading
it, and I think it is a fascinating book.

I\'m only on Chapter three, and I\'m still a skeptic.  I checked the net,
and there are many web sites of opinions--many agree with Drosnin\'s
conclusions, and many don\'t.

I don\'t really care who believes this stuff or not.  If you are
interested in it, read it.  If you are not, then don\'t read it.

But, just stop trying to convince me it is wrong.  

I don\'t know what it is--other than a facinating read.

We spend our time reading, for hours, Milieu 0, and we get entertainment
out of it.  Right now, Drosnin\'s book is entertainment to me.  Maybe
when I get done, I\'ll believe it, and maybe I won\'t.

Many of you have no place to critique the Bible Code because you haven\'t
read it, and you don\'t know what you are talking about.  Me, on the
other hand, has not finished the Bible Code, and I don\'t know what I\'m
talking about either.

I\'ve just reported on what I\'ve read.  Read it if you find it
interesting.

That\'s all I can say.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

	Perhaps you\'re using an old version of space combat rules, but it 
takes quite a bit longer than seconds or even 5 minutes to disable even a 
small warship like an SDB, Patrol Cruiser, or Kinunir.  This depends, of 
course, on what is attacking it, but your average pirate in a coverted 
merchantman is simply not going to have the fire power to do this.  
Current space combat turns are 30 minutes and it may take several to get 
a disabling hit on a target.  Light military ships like those mentioned 
above also have more than enough fire power to take out a pirate, even a 
small group of them.  Merchants are not so easy to disable, either.
	As for off-loading cargo in 15 minutes, I think this is also 
extremely optimistic.  It probably took far longer than 15 minutes to 
load the merchant ship at the port where they had the benefit of 
specialized gear.  Doing it through an airlock in space is likely to take 
much longer.
	Since an SDB only takes 1.5 hours from the mainworld to bring a 
target at the 100-d limit into range, the pirates only have that much 
time to disable the target, dock, off-load the cargo, and skedaddle.  
Given the realities of space combat, that is an almost impossibly short 
time.  Pirates working in gangs that can create diversions for each other 
might work, but that requires a lot of coordination and means that the 
gains from an economically marginal endeavor get spread even thinner.

The purification plant rather obviously is seperating hydrogen
*isotopes*. Producing hydrogen (unrefined fuel) is much faster.

Well, there may be resources more easily extracted on other worlds in
the system. Especially if they have any grasp of pollution effects.

Also, in systems that have gone thru the Long Night, they may have
advanced to the point of being able to travel within the system long
before recovering Jump tech. And they\'d have a *damn* good reason to
visit the other planets. Too look for relic technology. Which requires
at least small bases for searching for things that may not be visible
from orbit. After they get contacted, or re-develop jump, they\'d still
have the bases. There are *always* people who LIKE to live in isolated
areas where it\'s a struggle to survive.

Better check out the one that set the record. It was at least as

Force a wind force chart I came across while looking for something
else, at 75 mph wind exerts a force of 17 pounds per square foot. And
the way the force increases is not linear with velocity.

That can add up to quite a bit over the surface area of a ship. And it
can easily exceed the "sideways" forces the ship was designed for.

Well, just like current plants that draw in lots of water, you have
multiple layers of "filter". First a coarse screen (say 1 cm grid),
then finer screen, then the ceramic stuff. And I\'d tend to use a "pump"
that sucks X amount of water in thru the filters under low pressure and
then sends .5X back out under high pressure. That\'d tend to keep the
filters from getting seriously clogged. True, it involves pumping twice
as much water, but I still think it\'s sensible.

But thermal cracking will tend to wipe handle almost any goop you can pump.

The bacteria could do just as well if the ship landed in the spaceport.
Say a bird shits on the ship, and it lands somplace protected. Then on
another world, the ship gets rained on...

I can only assume that they do a quick and dirty thermal cracking,
which can get you hydrogen, but not easily seperate the isotopes.

  Are such aimed shots possible under the T4 rules? (Sorry, I\'m CT...)
In any case, if such a hit represents an event in a 15 or 30 minute
turn doesn\'t it still represent an average 5-15 minutes, say, to SOS?

  Is it possible to jam maser comms under current rules? Also, this
may very well work outbound, but inbound that\'s another hour into the
100 diameter limit. A pirate could be justified in considering that
to be a high risk.

>Except by then you could have sold your ship and bought a new one,

  Isn\'t interacting with the authorities _within_ the Imperium going
to be the basis of the problem? You probably just sold your ship at
a loss, and the new registration will be out before you\'ve left the
system. If it wasn\'t your ship you were selling, you may be as good
as caught already.

>Well, you are going to need something the size a Kunuir since

  Aren\'t wolf-packs of pirates contra-indicated? This allows
a single police plant to nail a half-dozen ships (potentially),
not to mention the class of merchant-cum-pirate vessel needed
to take out a state of the art warship 5 or 6 times their size.
In CT/HG, it effectively can\'t be done.

>ship out by suprise (which can be seconds, but lets assume

  Again, outbound this may very well be valid. In general,
and especially inbound, the time to match vectors will put
you well within the reach of COACC assets (not starships for
budgetary purposes) and increase available response time in
general.

  Does anybody happen to know some typical SDB allocations
from FFW? This would certainly illuminate one of the GG safety
issues.

Passive sensors are (in space combat) what will be used. Actives have far
to short a range to be useful at hundreds of thousands of km. A low skilled
sensorop would get as much information if he saw actual blips on a screen
but in reality (the Traveller reality) he\'d be presented with a display of
noiselevels and some hints from the software what kind of noise anomalies
there are. The sensor op decides what part of the screen to allot more
integration time and thus better signal.

Also, one huge advantage with passives is that they can integrate signal
over time but I\'m not shure how actives can do that; either they send
pulses and get information from their delays giving range to target faster
or they send continuously and can integrate but lose the range info as
there are no pulses (I also find it hard to believe that a continuously
sending radar can use the same dish for reception without seriously
increasing noise.

A skill the definately could be handled by low automation is Pilot, at
least when not dealing with reentry. Plotting courses in 3D with gravity is
fairly simple and dodging even more so.

I posted a while ago about what a passive sensor operator does - decides
how to trade off search area with depth, where to concentrate, what
wavelengths to concentrate on, what to do to get more info about a 2-sigma
contact.

Active sensor opreastors do have some similar decisions to make - setting
up the sweep pattern for the radar to affect how often and how deep a 
particular region is probed, interpreting faint contacts, etc. 
(Try and flight simulator with a good model for the onboard radar - 
there\'s a non-zero amount of work to do to keep the radar optimized for
the task at hand.)

That being said, it could all be automated - and even if it isn\'t, there
isn\'t a *huge* difference between what a good operator and a bad
operator can do (just like there probably ins\'t for gunnery); but
Traveller tends to exaggerate (legitimately) the importance of 
skills. 

Actually, the current DSR reflect (somewhat) the lesser importance of 
the operator for active sensors - active sensors go from "undetectable"
to "automatically detected" more rapidly with decreasing range (this is also
the R^4 dependence in action, of course.)

In the real world(tme) there are pirates but not worldwide. The reason I
think there is piracy (aside from the fact that I like the romantic
depiction of pirates as badly dressed serious drinkers who are experts with
Rapier and Main Gauche) in Traveller is that the number of spaceports is so
huge. The mainworld has one up to several ports but most medium pop and up
systems will have spaceports all over the place; moons, asteroids,
artificial colonies etc - all these can be pirated so the navy has to
patrol LOTS of places in each system.

	Douglas, I\'ll grant you all that.  I\'ll grant you complete and
total knowledge of the destination and cargo of all ships in the system.
I\'ll grant you GG refueling.  Whatever you want.  But you still haven\'t
addressed the points I was making. Namely, that the presence of a single
SDB makes piracy untenable.  And, that even in the absence of SDBs, the
presence of armed merchants makes capturing the target rather expensive
and therefore not a winning proposition economically.
	This is not to say that piracy is totally impossible, only that
it can only occur under a highly restrictive set of circumstances:

	(1) absence of SDBs
	(2) superior arms on the part of pirates

	And let me reiterate, at 1% of GDP for Naval spending, even
150,000 people can support an SDB.  So condition (1) will hold only in
_really_ small systems, and how much trade do they generate?  Besides, if
they\'re that small a settelment and they have no space defenses, you
could just hold the entire population hostage by threatening to drop
rocks on them until they hand over all their wealth in some portable form.
	(2) Is important because if the pirate and merchant are equally
matched then the merchant has as much chance of disabling the pirate as
the pirate has of disabling the merchant!

	If you want pirates because you think pirates are fun, then
okay.  But the Trav universe simply does not allow for economically
viable pirates, and its that position that I am arguing with.

I think pirates are unlikely/rare. 

In all of SF I can think of three situations where piracy was occuring
in a plausible manner.

1. Heinlein\'s "Citizen of the Galaxy".
   The pirates are capturing free traders and small merchants. They are
   selling the cargos (and crews!) in another government\'s area. That
   government doesn\'t "support" the pirates. That is, it doesn\'t give
   them ships, and it doesn\'t supply them crews. But it does fuel and
   repair them (at normal rates). And it certainly isn\'t trying to
   *stop* them. But even though it might let them get away with
   refitting a captured ship and re-registering it, they likely
   wouldn\'t tolerate raids on *their* ships.
2. Some of Andre Norton\'s stories.
   This appears to be a case of opirates operating in areas outside
   those controlled by the big interstellar powers. And there\'s also
   the Theives Guild, which has people almost everywhere, and even has
   its own *ports* on worlds not known to the government. The guild
   doesn\'t have pirates as members, but they\'ll cheerfully sell them
   services and buy their loot.
3. E.E.(Doc) Smith\'s "Lensman" stories.
   Here we have "pirates" that are actually "commerce raiders" from
   another "government". Boskone is an autocracy, and they don\'t much
   care what you do as long as you get the job done. They see nothing
   wrong with drug-running, slavery, and other such thing (think of
   them as the Mafia grown big enough to *be* a government).

Case 1 is only applicable on the fringes of the Imperium. Case 2 is
applicable a bit farther into the Imperium, but still relies on there
being unexplored areas or some other way to cheaply have "hidden" bases.
Case 3 could apply all through the Imperium, but only because the
"pirates", being agents of a real government, have enough resources to
*create* complete hidden starports even inside the Imperium.

Note that Case 3 isn\'t really "pirates". But they\'ll be called that
until it eventually becomes obvious that what is really going on is a
war of attrition.

	I think this is the crux of the thread.  The way this could be
resolved, if it can be, is for Douglas to tell us what level of naval
spending he would consider reasonable and not "a massive military
buildup."  If Hans can show that less than 1% of that budget would be
all that\'s required to stamp out piracy, we\'ll consider the
"insufficient resources" part of the argument finished.  Douglas and
others are free to argue that the Imperium wouldn\'t distribute these
anti-piracy forces in an equitable manner or bring up other reasons why
piracy would still exist, but no one would be able to credibly say that
the resources were lacking, only the will.
	Hans, Douglas, what do you say?  Sound fair?

____________________________________
Well, I may disagree with this being the only point, but it definitely is 
one of the points!  :)

"To monitor the space lanes, the Imperium maintains a Navy.  Because these 
forces can never be everywhere at once, local provinces (subsectors) also 
maintain navies, as do individual worlds.  This three tiered structure of 
Imperial, Subsector, and planetary navies produces a flexible system for 
patrolling space, while putting the limited resources of the Imperium to 
best use"  Book 5 - High Guard, page 1.

I really can\'t give you a number.  I wish I could. I\'m only a \'tinkerhead\', 
not a full fledged gearhead.  The numbers we are bandying around date back 
to CT, and some of the fleet structures we are using run through MT.  I 
have not seen any Capital ships built using T4 yet, so I don\'t have a good 
idea of cost.  But roughly, let\'s assume the Imperial Navy gets 1.5%, the 
Subsector Navy gets 1%, the Scouts get 1%, the Army and Marines get 1% 
between them, and all the other services, branches that have to do with law 
enforcement get .5%.  Let\'s also assume that 50% of the Navy\'s funding goes 
towards infrastructure (bases, training costs, operational expenses, R&D, 
etc...)  How are those for numbers?

Based on the tactics I\'ve read regarding the frontier wars, you are not 
going to see fleet strengths in excess of the perceived threat.  The 
example of ADM Plankwell, IMHO, put an end to excessively large fleets in 
the hands of IN admirals, wouldn\'t you agree?  And while the numbers used 
by TCS are distributed directly to the IN, there are several military 
branches, all requiring funding, not to mention the infrastructure cost. 
 TCS doesn\'t address building Navy bases or funding Depots at all, as I 
remember.

(BTW, my copy of TCS and my copy of CT\'s Fighting Ships both seem to have 
fallen into a black hole.  Since Marc has graciously given permission for 
copies to be made, could someone please...?  Scans would be fine, and I 
promise that I am actively pursuing real, paper copies of both of these 
tomes!  :)

Please remember, I am not trying to change canon, the following remarks are 
based on my interpretation of canon...

(deep breath, [rustle of anti-flame gear])  All of the arguments I\'ve heard 
so far are based, I believe, on the idea of a stable, comfortable Imperium. 
 And that it may appear to be, towards the core.  But let us also remember, 
that in every extended character generation chart, there are lots and lots 
of opportunities for combat.  In High Guard the range was:

2	Battle
3	Shore Duty
4	Siege
5	Strike
6	Patrol
7	Training
8	Patrol
9	Strike
10	Shore Duty
11	Special Duty
12	Special Duty

So, let me propose that perhaps the Imperium isn\'t quite as calm as it 
appears, at least on the frontier.  Who do you suppose the Navy is sending 
Sieges and Strikes at, and where are all the Battles are being fought?  The 
Imperium and the Nobility are placed upon the shoulders of the planets. 
 There is no reason that the planets need to like this, nor that they will 
decide that this is a "good thing" in any quick order.  (for examples, how 
long had the Vietnam war been fought before America foolishly got involved? 
 I\'ve heard numbers ranging up to 300 years.  How long have the Irish been 
fighting the English?  How about the Basque Separatists?  For that matter, 
how long have Christians been fighting the Islamic for Jerusalem?)

So, you want to drop a squadron of Imperial SBDs into a system.  Where is 
the support base?  Oh, you\'ll just run \'em out of the starport?  (Class E? 
 Cleared Bedrock?)  OK, where will the crew be stationed?  There are no 
barracks (no Navy or Scout Base), so you\'ll put \'em in town.  A TL-5 world? 
 And you expect them to be happy?  OK, the crew is stationed on-world.  A 
low tech world can\'t possible hope to support the ships, so all services 
are imported.  There is not the industrial or technical base to man these 
ships, so all this is imported as well.  You\'ve got a crew on liberty, 
enjoying the sights.  Having seen what "civilized" 18 yo sailors do on 
liberty I can guarantee two things 1) the sailors will be having fun and 2) 
the locals will not!  :)  Whether they intend it or not, a us/them 
mentality will develop.  They will have \'toys\' that most of the locals 
would give eyeteeth for.  Hand Comps, Aids, Comms - think of all the 
goodies that they will have.  Think about the drunk sailor in the bar that 
pulls out a credstick to pay (by mistake), then laughingly throws the 
\'monopoly money\' on the bar to pay the tab.  Watched by all the locals, to 
whom that credstick is a month\'s pay.  See the sailor wake up (if he\'s 
lucky) the next morning in his underwear on the beach.  (True story, 
adapted freely for the environment)

What I am trying to say is that a little piracy, in the eyes of a system, 
may not be a high cost to keep them \'damn Impies\' out!  And smuggling may 
very well be viewed as a cottage industry!

Anyway, so then we have the Subsector fleets.  These are manned by 
resources local to the Subsector, which could be good or bad depending on 
the local history.  I definitely see some intra-planet rivalry tho\'.  These 
are not as high tech as the Imperial fleet, simply because the resources 
are not there to pick and choose from.  While they would have a greater 
percentage of smaller ships, the placement of those ships are more at the 
control of the local nobility than the Imperial Fleet.  Again, basing 
requirements are going to force the ships to the planets that can support 
them.  According to \'Fighting Ships of the shattered Imperium\' Colonial 
Fleets (the equivalent of the Subsector Fleet from CT) will be stationed at 
worlds TL9+ and Pop9+ (not just at Navy Bases).  And finally, the ultimate 
in reserve fleets, the Planetary Navies.  I don\'t see these moving from 
worlds of origin.  These are stationed at worlds that are TL9+ and Pop4+.

So, the argument that any planet with a POP of 150,000+ can support a SBD 
is correct.  I did not argue that.  I argue that a Starport C, Low Pop, 
sub-stellar TL planet cannot, and will not, have permanent basing of ships. 
 My interpretation of canon is that the planets will not want this, and 
will actively oppose it unless the perceived benefit of such basing is 
greater than the implied menace that will exist without it.  In any case, 
it is difficult to operate starships, not to mention man them, under such 
conditions.

I might point out that this does not even touch on the subject of resource 
allocation, and perceived inequities (our planet pays for 8% of the 
Subsector fleet, why isn\'t that here!) or political clout in basing matters 
(just what clout does a low pop, Ni, NAg world have, and why are we wasting 
assets there).  Nor does it touch on the fact that the majority of military 
ships are going to be built at lower TLs (I seem to recall TL C as the base 
IN ship??), while pirates who wish to be successful are going to have TL F 
AEMS suites.

I want to finish with post with this.  I have gotten a sense that some of 
the list is getting bored and/or tired of this topic.  And I know that my 
arguments are drawing closer and closer to campaign specific, which is not 
necessarily applicable to the list.  If there is an interest in continuing 
this thread, I will continue to discuss it.  If there is not, but 
individuals would like to discuss the topic, then feel free to e-mail me 
personally.  I have strong feeling in some areas, and this happens to be 
one of \'em!  :-)

+0.5, actually. x10 area and x10 power buys you x100 more signal-to-noise,
which lets you see targets x3.3 further away, which is +0.5 sensitivity.
(Convieniently, since active sensors in FFS2 always use the same power per
unit area, this works very nicely on the tables...And produces the same
scaling (x10 area => +0.5 range) that passives have.

One thing they can do is add together multiple scans of the same target - 
if you scan the whole sky every minute (or whatever) and get a 
marginal detection one pass and another marginal detection the next pass
you can be more certain you have something real.

Sure, but compared to what we would call "streamlined" *today*, it doesn\'t
really match ... of course, I suppose, the problem is in defining exactly what
is *meant* by AF and SL compared to USL ... and I don\'t just mean (random)
numbers that FF&S or High Guard throws at us, what exactly is the difference in
*descriptive* terms ... and from an official source, too! There isn\'t one, so we
can be arguing like we disagree when we mean the same things ... :-(

And with any material suitable for use in keeping structural and atmospheric
integrity in a Spacecraft, this should not be a problem. Certainly not at TL/9+

The interesting thing about AF/SL/USL hullforms is that they all perform
identicaly *in space* ... now, if the hull was for a big fat and slow Merchie,
yeah, I agree that the hull probably wouldn\'t be stressed for high speed
maneuvers even in space. However, for (say) a 6G stressed USL combat rated hull?
If it can withstand 6G (plus, allowing for sideways vectors etc.) hull stresses
and maintain structural and atmospheric integrity, well, I reckon it would have
damn all trouble handling a piddling little 75 mph crosswind!

Like I said, the real problem is that the original provision for no USL landings
on atmosphere possessing planets made "sense" (sort of ) only as long as no
attempt was made to explain *why* this was the case. Once you do, you have smart
alec bastards like me who are quite happy to keep on pointing out the logical
flaws in any pseudo-reason that is put forward. Because, simply put, there is no
logical and believable reason that has been given to date.

I personally prefer (obviously!) the suggestion I made ... you *can* do a USL
landing/takeoff, but its so slow that doing it anywhere other than the safest
worlds is *not* a good idea ... the target you make is too easy to hit, and
stays a target for too long! Not to mention the fact that it isn\'t fast enough
to be a decent smuggler ... both of which are important in the background
usually presented to Trav players of financially stressed small shipowners
where, as they say, "time is money" (sort of ;-)

The problem for the pirates is that the main world is where the action is,
target-wise. A pirate may be waiting a lot longer for a nice juicy target
if they stick to the fringes of a system (not to mention getting the Navy
interested as to exactly *why* this ship is hanging out near Uranus).

One SDB defends one world. If you have five worlds, you will need five
SDBs. All jump traffic will be coming in and leaving within 100 diameters,
so that is the only area we need to defend. Insystem traffic can travel in
convoy if it really really has to.

Remember, if a SDB costs MCr10 a year to maintain and your citizens pay
Cr100 naval taxes each per year, you can have a SDB per 100 000 citizens.
Assume two thirds of them are in the shop at any given time (reasonable for
cutting-edge immature technologies like a Collins-class submarine circa
1997, unreasonable for a mature stable technology like HMS Victory circa
1805), and two-thirds of the naval budget is wasted, then you get one SDB
per million people.

Yes, but you only need to defend the bits with planets or ships in it. By
similar argument, the Atlantic was too big to defend against U-boats in
WW2. But with convoy, you only need to defend the 100 square miles of it
that contain convoys at any given time.

And it is convoy that absolutely, completely, comprehensivly screws piracy.

	Certainly, and with diversionary tactics being employed on purpose, your
poor old super-duper SDB would be useless.

	A fine parallel in history would be William the Conqueror\'s invasion of
Britain in 1066. While not an act of piracy, it demonstrated the use of a
diversion to thwart the defenders.

	In this case, Bill Conq sent a force to a pretty northern part of
Scotland. King Harold sent his army up there to defeat them, only for them
to then realise that they had to schlep all the way back down to the
south-east coast of England for a starring role in the Battle of Hastings.

	Being 1066 and British Rail not yet even going through the rigours of
privatisation, Harold\'s army were unable to buy a ticket for the trip down
south, and decided to walk there instead of waiting 800 years for the rail
network to be built.

	Upon arriving at Hastings, Harold\'s army were suitably shagged out from
the long walk, and also due to being duped into a false call from the
Frenchies that William was dead, they were eventually unable to stop
William\'s army from chucking arrows around. "Oi! You could \'ave an eye out
with that! Oh, got the point chaps."

	When Will\'s army arrived in London, they were met with open arms from the
locals, only because they realised that they were utterly unable to defend
themselves.

	So, no matter how effective a defensive force can be, with the right
degree of diversions and other tactics, it can be stuffed. Sometimes. We
haven\'t been invaded since, you know ;-) Except by MacDonalds...

	See ya...

I think the basic rule about no landings on atmosphere planets with USL
hull came way back in CT land when as to wether ships used antigravity or
fusion torches or whatever to go about was not dwelt upon.

I\'d allow USL landings but let them take a long time (several hours and a
pretty trivial Pilot roll) and they\'d be illegal in say B+ starports as
this super slow descent not adhering to standard highspeed entry corridors
would clog up traffic for the poor starport controllers.

Pirates aren\'t "waiting a lot longer for a nice juicy target". They go
there in a legal ship or have an informer at the starport(s) thet tells
about nice juicy targets and their routes. As highly valuable cargoes often
are kept secret the pirates will probably need some contacts within large
insurance companies (piarets would mix well with insurance people thay are
all of the same type :). Why are there so many pirates milling about in
bars at the seedier parts of startown? They\'re fishing for rumors about
departure times, cargo manifests, ship armaments etc.

   Contract disputes have a way of making things happen on TV series. 
So do cases where the star decides that they don\'t want to return, but
there are enough people in the ensemble cast that the show goes on.

   Among the shows where things like this have happen before:

1) Almost every American daytime drama ("soap opera") ever made 

2) Dallas

3) Star Trek: The Next Generation

4) M*A*S*H

5) All In the Family

   Normally these things are resolved in such a manner that the
character is "reassigned" or moves away (i.e. Beverly Crusher, STNG), so
if the actor changes their mind, or the creator of the show find a
person to replace the original actor (i.e. "Miss Ellie", Dallas), the
character can be brought back.

   Never assume that a popular character is gone forever, just because
they are dead.  As fans of Dallas and Star Trek can testify to that.

>This show is truly amazing.  You\'d never see this on Star Trek.

   Oh, but in fact you have.  It is not used too frequently as a plot
device, but it has been done before.

Regards,

Harold

P.S.  I\'m looking forward to the reshowing of B5 as well, since it was
shown in first run here in Dayton, Ohio at 1 am on Sunday night.  There
was/is absolutely no justification for it, except that one local TV
station purchased the right to show the series for the sole purpose of
denying it to another local TV station that is known for its broadcast
of sci-fi shows (for example, they broadcast all versions of Star Trek a
minimum of 3 hours a day, not to mention the occasional Star Trek
marathon).  I can\'t begin to count the number of epsiodes that I\'ve
missed. <grumble, grumble>

I\'ve read bad history before, but this takes the cake.  That \'force\' had
nothing to do with William.  It was the invading army of Harald Hardraada,
the Norwegian adventurer-king.  He landed one of the largest viking forces
in history near York, but was surprised by Harold Godwinson\'s English army
and defeated at Stamford Bridge.  William wasn\'t brilliant (at least not in
this), he was lucky.  He also chose the date and place of his invasion
purely by chance - that was when the winds permitted his fleet to move.  

The only thing worse than not knowing any history is knowing too little.

Some of us in Canada and other countries outside the US won\'t get B5

I agree with what you are suggesting, but are they really \'reactionless\'

The CJ Cherryh book \'Tripoint\' has an interesting part where one merchant
is unloading to another in space while there is incoming fire. I
recommended the book wholeheartedly.

15 min to unload a merchant ship carrying 60 to 80 dt of cargo? - get real!
You need to unstrap the cargo (I assume that you aren\'t leaving it loose)
and then shift it to the other ship. So, say they are 5dt boxes, that gives
you 3 min per box to unfasten, load, carry to an adjacent ship, unload, and
refasten for a 60 dt cargo bay. Probably without the benefit of any grav
vehicles (as they don\'t operate so well out of the gravity well). Also each
5dt box is approx 3m x 3m x 7m, around the same size as an isofreight.

*Maybe* (if practiced and well trained) you could do it in 10 minutes a
box, 2 hours total for a 60 dt cargo.

	Woah, hold on there cowboy, I was only talking about the 100-d 
limit of the mainworld.  Early in the thread I pointed out how an SDB 
could bring any point inside the 100-d limit under attack in 1.5 hours.  
I assumed Douglas would remember what I was talking about so I didn\'t go 
through the details again.
	If you believe there\'s a lot of normal space intra-system 
traffic, then you\'re right, SDBs can\'t patrol all of that.  Piracy of 
intra-system trade is still difficult though because unless the pirate 
has a higher-g ship than the target, he\'ll have trouble matching vectors 
with him.  Still, intra-system piracy would seem to be the most likely kind.

	A single SDB can clobber anybody misbehaving inside the 100-d 
limit of the mainworld.

surfaces and a pointy shape.
Streamlining includes a certain amount of structural bracing etc which
prevents a starship falling apart under wind stresses and also gravity (I
have problems with really dispersed structures pulling 4g turns!)

My ruling has always been: Airframes can glide, gererate lift and dogfight
if the mood takes them.
Streamlined ships can travel fast in straight lines in atmosphere, and can
make wide turns.
Unstreamlined ships can make risky atmospheric landings using CG, subject
to Horrible Referee Interference.

Similarly, landing on soft ground close to the \'adventure site\' keeps
characters from having to take any risks like meeting the locals. Too
convenient. So if someone wants to search for a \'safe\' landing site (stable
ground, hard rock, paved patio or whatever) then this will be a little way
from the adventure site if I can help it.

Now, if proximity is desired, the players can risk landing on softer
ground, and may have problems due to Justifiable Horrible Referee
Interference (ie sinking landing legs, boggy ground etc). Clever dodges
like bellying the ship rather than using the legs (subject to some risk)
will help.

I\'ve always liked my players to be reminded occasionally that a starship is
a pretty wondrous thing. It\'s not a bus. Characters are \'living the
experience\' of starflight, and need to deal with the details occasioanlly.
It also gives me a chance to bushwack them on the way to the Lost Temple of
Bogdit or whatever, and prevents convenient pickup when they manage to get
into trouble (they always do).


In other words, I\'ve always approached the Landings thing from the point of
view of:
 \'what ruling can I justify using, which will make the game the most

	thats the point. While it is possible to produce enormous
	amouts of SDBs to secure any GG on any f*cking backwater
	system, shipyards are generaly suffering from lack of orders.

	A lot of planets have their shipyards. If it dos\'nt make
	economical sense to build ships here, the shipyard will run
	subsidary, as politcans still want to have a shipyard at
	their planet for the event of war. Normaly they build traders,
	as any planet needs trade to sustain their techlevel, and
	to not provoke the duke, or empress of the neighboring system.
	When the first system starts massive subventions of traders
	shipyards next will either close or also becoming subsidaries
	of their government. Together with the 1000Cr/ton constrain
	of imperial trade, it becomes more and more expensive to
	have a shipyard at full production.

	As most trade is Jump:1,2,3 Tl:10,11,12 shipyards will be the
	cheapest for traders and liners. So high tech starports will
	either run subsidary, or produce military ships and yachts.

	Perhaps I\'m a bit pessimistic as Vulkan closed some month ago,
	and Luerrsen is the last big shipyard in Bremen. They are building
	Yachts and Destroyers. Agakhans Yacht runs 62 knots, and their
	destroyers are know to be nearly as fast (58). But can shipproduction
	rely on government spendings for long ? I dont think so.

6) B5. General Hague was killed off because of this. Here are some notes
about it by JMS, taken from the Lurker\'s Guide
<http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide>:

   Foxworth [the actor playing Genral Hague] was slated for "Severed Dreams"
   when he bailed on us.

   We had booked Foxworth long in advance. Later, out of the blue, a rep for the
   actor said that by accident he\'d been double-booked on B5 and DS9 for the
   same period...and even though we had prior claim, because the other was a
   two-parter, more money, they went for that. One can only wonder when the
   other offer *really* came in....

   The Foxworth bail resulted in a change of about three lines, that\'s about it.
   You\'ll know which lines when you hear them.

   We\'d booked the actor long, long in advance. At the last minute, he bailed to
   do a DS9 episode playing, essentially, the same character, despite our having

On to Traveller: Obviously this has value in explaining the *real* reason
Strephon was assassinated in MT. He got a better-paying role in Star Trek.
Harold\'s point that dead really doesn\'t mean "dead, dead, dead ... dead as

dead yet!" Wahhaaahaha!!!... <trails off> Hmm ... sorry.

	Well, you haven\'t mentioned the planetary Navy, which would be 
the most likely to defend against pirates in the system.  But later you 
talk about low-tech and low-pop worlds as being the problem areas, so can 
we agree that any world big enough and hi-tech enough to have its own 
planetary navy is unlikely to be a hospitable place for pirates?
	Now, about the numbers, when you say 50% is for infrastructure, I 
assume that means that the other 50% is for ships.  Does this include the 
ship\'s maintenance, etc?  Or should I use the TCS rule that the navy has 
to spend 10% of the ship\'s purchase price on maintenance, salaries, etc?

	Well, the presence of lots of opportunities for combat would seem 
to encourage the investment in plenty of naval vessels, aggressive

	These are exactly the kind of non-resource arguments that you and 
others are free to make.  The presence or absence of these problems 
depends in part on your particular campaign and are really a matter of 
taste.  I\'m only arguing that Imperium has more than enough resources to 
stamp out piracy, all else being equal.
	As for smuggling, I think this is far more likely than piracy.  
But remember, the Impies have next to nothing to say about what you can 
trade.  Except for nukes and slaves I think everything else is fair 
game.  So if the locals are smuggling, they\'re smuggling things past the 
planetary authorities, not the Impies.

	Okay, I think we\'re making progress.  Marginal worlds with 
sub-stellar TLs will not have the indigenous capability to form a 
planetary navy, but stellar TL worlds of Pop 150,000+ will have the 
resources to support at least an SDB.  I agree completely.
	I can even agree that it might not make sense to permanently base 
subsector forces on such low-tech worlds.  To the extent that they are 
defended by subsector forces, it will be done by jump-capable ships that 
are deployed there for some length of time.

	Well, I don\'t get the idea from canon sources that there is this 
much animosity between most low-tech planets and the Imperium.  I\'d think 
that most low-tech planets would want Impie facilities on their world for 
the economic stimulation and opportunity for the locals to get jobs on 
the base and learn hi-tech skills.  But again, this is a matter of taste 
and will depend on an individuals campaign world.

	I certainly would not expect that pirates would routinely have
access to more advanced gear than the IN.  If you are arguing that a 
fast, armed, hi-tech ship from an advanced world might go out to harass 
the locals in some backwater, then I\'d agree that that would certainly be 
possible.  However, I\'d think that such a ship would quickly stick out, 
which would be bad for pirates.  At the very least, they\'d have to keep 
moving and avoid worlds with a planetary navy.

> I want to finish with post with this.  I have gotten a sense that some of

	I agree.  The list is occasionally taken over by big debates 
about things like task systems, Virus, etc.  But I think we are close to a 
kind of consensus on at least the resouce part of this discussion, so I\'d 
like to stick it out just a little longer, if you don\'t mind.  If you can 
answer my questions about how much you imagine being available for the 
IN, I\'ll see what sort of anti-pirate force seems reasonable.
	Oh yeah, and since we\'re doing this on the subsector basis, I 
need you to pick a subsector and send me population and TL stats for it.

Look a little closer; Its four vehicles on two sided "cards", each has a
front and a back.

I never checked to see if photocoying permission is included in the

them together, only to write all over them and need another, buying another

Also, if you look at extended system data, most decent sized systems

Um, no.  I\'m saying a Kinunir _would_  deter all but the most
rare forms of piracy.  But, when the pirate attacks an unarmed
or poorly armed merchant, the ships has to get there and that
 the time pirate has to transfer cargo and jump.

Except the port isn\'t trained an optimaized for speed (since it
really doesn\'t matter if it takes an hour instead.)  I also
is unwillling to damage the vessel.  A pirate can have their
hold already evacuated with lines standing by, blow the hatch
on the cargo ship, and then just use the lines and the
fact that you are in zero G to pull it over.  In any case,
even if it took 30 min, the pirate has enough time.

Not only that, it works the other way, too...one reason the Normandy
invasion (in WWII, Not the Norman Invasion being discussed) succeeded 
was because the German High Command was convinced that the landings were a
feint, and held back Rommel\'s Panzer divisions until it was far too late
to repel the Allies. 

Why? Because the Allies had taken great care to make them _think_ that an
invasion was going to happen at Calais, the \'natural\' place to invade
France...

also quite applicable, by clever GM\'s and PC\'s...

I think passive sensors only detect something active (accelerating ships,
firing weapons, active sensors and such). They do not detect lurking pirate
ships, debris and other energy-dead objects.

I\'ve been reading all the Starship Trooper/Battledress/VaccSuit thread, I\'m
quite interested in all of it.

On the Vacc Suit vs. Battledress thread : my thoughts.

Vacc Suit is a skill specific to use and maintain a self contained
environmental control system in environments from hostile-corrosive
atmosphere to vacuum, and from normal (1g) gravity to micro or null
gravity.  I\'m sure that there comes some experience and/or familiarity with
high gee environments ass might be encountered on a star ship during
maneuvers.  Other skills involved might be proper use of low gee tools,
special environmental tools (non sparking in a methane or other combustible
atmosphere, understanding the various warning devices for low consumables,
radiation warning, commo gear, safety procedures, etc.

Battledress is a skill specifically to use, maintain, and execute military
operations in an armoured, self contained, and possibly augmented suit.
Other skills the suit would use are matching the chameleon properties of
the suit ( if so equipped ) to surrounding terrain, use of weapons,
fighting skills, tools, etc. etc. etc.

Is there still a zero-G-combat or zero-G-maneuver skill?

Probably the best thing to do in any case is to make computer files out of
the sheets. Then, you can print them out when you need them. This applies to
virtually everything (character sheets, price lists etc.), provided that you
own a printer.

If not, you can always write new sheets by hand :-)

A friend of mine, who does not play RPG\'s, had a nice book sitting on a
shelf. It\'s title is \'Spacecraft 2000 to 2100 A.D.\', and it details
spacecraft from a very early period of the Traveller universe (it has to be
Traveller, the ships are exactly in that style). I have a few questions
about this book:

* What milleu covers this early period?

* The book refers to two other races, living in the Centauri star system,
4.3 light years away from Earth. The inhabitants of Alpha Centauri are
obviously almost human, but there are references to the strange anatomy of
the people from Proxima Centauri. Could you please give me information about
these races?

Please bear in mind that I am a Traveller newbie, having owned the game for
about a month. All I know is what is written in the T4 rulebook and the
three equipment supplements I own (Starships, General supply catalog,
Emperor\'s arsenal). I will get Milleu: 0 soon, but my local game store does
not have it in stock right now :-(

Don\'t know, but if I was GMing I would regard suprise attack
on an unarmed ship to be a special case anway.  Anyway, I
certainly would let the ship target engineering which is
going to cut power and prevent a distress call.

Well, the problem is that the turn both includes time before
the shot (when the clock isn\'t running) and time to cycle
around to return fire (which irrelvant if you disable in one
shot).

I\'m not talking about wolf-packs.  I\'m talking about a couple
smugglers that decide on an adhoc basis to get together than take
out that scout that the Imperium unwisely sent by itself
to stop piracy.

Well, you can catch them as the arrive and their

is better.

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

I hate B5 spoilers.  I usually mark my posts if they contain spoilers,
but I took additional care to make sure I didn\'t give anything away.

You know somebody dies, but that\'s it.  You have no idea who it is from
my post.

Also, this is not fact yet.  I just read it on the web.  I haven\'t seen
the actual episode when the character does die.

I will be extra careful in the future.

Completely my fault, and I apologize.  

I was just extremely excited about the show.  It was damn good.

You\'ll get no more spoilers without warner posted warning from this B5
fan.

This is one of the key secrets to good RPG adventures. So, the rules may not
be THAT realistic. They are, on the other hand, fast and action-packed. So,
the existence of pirates is somewhat illogical. But they are such a
wonderful part of the Traveller universe, so leaving them out would remove
much fun. So, the microorganisms virtually everywhere are harmless to
humans. If they weren\'t, everyone would wear protective gear all the time.
Prevents those nasty insects and reptiles from biting the characters.

The only limit is your (and your players\') imagination, not some boring
logic. Have fun !

	Fine. However, we studied this in school and we were taught that William
had sought the Norwegian king\'s aid in invading Britain (sorry I couldn\'t
remember this detail before). The idea we were taught was for the other
army to tire out the English army in Scotland - where you note that it was
instead York - so that they would be unable to repel William\'s forces when
he came to invade.

In MT, I believe that the tasks associated with active sensors
are easier than those with passive sensors. So it\'d be easier
to determine the nature of your opposition, once both of you
know each other\'s location.

Expelling reaction mass isn\'t the only way to have an exhaust.  It
may be that the process that generates lift also generates
exhaust as a side product.  (It also explains all those
movies where a ship uses thrustsers that do exhaust, but
clearly don\'t put out enough mass to hold the ship up :-)

I have to diagree.  You attack and disable an unarmed ship.  Even
if we assume that it can get a distress signal off, the port
operator has to forward the call and then they have to
scrable the defense boat.  Then it has to make it out
to the spot where the attack occured.  That can easily
take most of an hour, plenty of time to tranfer the
cargo.

Also, a SDB is not that impressive a ship.  There are armed
merchants that are as well armed.  If you get to pirates
cooperating and then they suprise the ship, it\'s dead.

As to the main world being where the "action" is.  Sure it
is more desirable.  But you attack where you can.  After
all, the best people to mug are those walking out of
Jewelry stores (during business hours abviously).  However,
muggings occur in isolated areas of low traffic.  This
is how piracy occurs.

First of all, you don\'t need to carefully unstrap it.  You just
cut the bloody things.  Also, you can just use a rope to pull
them from ship to ship and hual them in.  And you don\'t have
to wait until the first one has been trasnfered before you start
the second one (for example you put them on a stringer).
Nor do you have
to do any of this anymore carefully than is necessary so that
the prodominate portion of the cargo survives (in fact you
could just take what you can get and leave when time is up).
Finally, with G comp, there is no reall reason to have to
tie them down again.

Remember, you don\'t use time it would take to transfer
the cargo at leasure, in port, being carefull not to
damage the ship and not loose any cargo.  You use what
the optimum time would be for someone who didn\'t care
about the ship he was unloading, is in zero gravity,
can put up with a few losses, and has time to think
about how this would be done and prepare himself to do
it.

Well, "2" is closest.  Actually piracy does exist in cannon
(it\'s in the enouncter tables) but I assume you mean "exist"
as the Traveller univers is set up.  But I would say that it
would be better stated that if are willing to adapt the
setting ( with things like regulated
departure points, a policy that is based on an emotional
response to piracy rather than the actualy costs, etc.
easy possitive identification of all ships, disallowing
armed civilian vessels, etc) to assume things that are
not delineated in the setting, then you can have a setting
where piracy is very rare, except near the borders (which
will depend on the politics with your neighbors).

First off - a pirate may only have to fire one volley to convince the
merchant he is serious and convince the merchant to dump cargo and run to
avoid *expensive* damage and possible loss of the ship.  If the Capt of
the merchant knows he will take 100 KCr + in damage, assuming he survives,
there may not be a distress call, much less combat.

Second, you don\'t need a second ship to provide a diversion.  A drone with
a battery, timer,  and jammer will suffice.  Perhaps a short, recorded
message that plays while the jammer powers up.  It shouldn\'t take much,
you just need to grab the attention of System Defense, and force them to
investigate.

And, if you get them to the point where they confirm all distress calls
prior to moving off station...all the better!!


Finally, don\'t assume that there will be a SBD in orbit (I\'ve heard that
over and over again), or if that the SBD is stationed in orbit, that the
crew is aboard!  They have lives too...

Well, I knew that this is what you were referring to, as that seems to be
the focus of this debate.

It will be the greatest concentration of wealth, but also the riskiest.
However, there will be some cargoes coming in from, say mining worlds,
that could have great intrinsic value as well!  :)

But only if it is on station (not responding to another distress or
anomaly, not inport getting maintenance, not performing escort duty for
the convoys that have been bandied about, etc...), online (not waiting for
parts because the mainworld is not able to technically support the ship) 
and manned for duty (i.e. the crew is on liberty or something)

	We came up with at least one man year of work. Quite a lot of money.
	Distributing this work to the fans, would be a posible solution.

	My idea of producing such a beast would be :

	The files where transphered to a web site, anybody can get a login
	on this site, if he signs that the work he is editing is under
	CopyRight of IG/FF, that its ok that his name will appear in the
	"credits" list, and that only major work will offer a free CDROM.

	For this login he get the account for reading lets say 5 pages.
	He can profread any page, and send it to the lectors list,
	increasing his account by an other 5 pages. And so on until all
	pages where profread and ready for press. Redrawing any deckplan
	in a CAD suite, should also increase the account. To have
	Postscript file for printing and not only a gif for the page
	would be nice.

	When the game is finished the web site will become open for
	public and Marc is selling CDs.

	Exact, stupid pirates are dead pirates. btw pirate as a career
	are canon, at least in TNE where its posible to become drafted
	into a even more career: The Prisoner ;-)

	You wont find pirates anywhere in the "Trav universe". But
	the "Trav universe" extends in space and time. So while you
	wont pirates around Sylea in M0, you\'ll find them in 1202
	in the same area. And there where you find them, they wont
	call themselfs pirates, but e.g. "Diaspora Trade Guild". 
	Piracy could be "economically viable" at some times and
	in some areas. I\'m living in the Hanse Stadt Bremen, and
	of course we played some of our fantasy settings "at home"
	so we undertook some recherce of old writings the so called
	Bremensien. We found a very interesting paper about that
	several Hanse Rathsherren gave 3 ships to a man called
	Stoertebaecker who was a well known pirate of that time,
	they gave him the ships because he had lost one when
	fighting an english vessel, and they wanted that he continued
	to act as a privateer. Some years later he had about a
	dozend vessels and moved into the Weserburg, blocking Bremen.
	This was enough and the Burg was charged. He left with 2
	vessels and died on a burning ship some month later.

	ObTrav: Piracy could be "economically viable" even in a trade
	empire like the early 3I. Tukaera could give one pirate a ship,
	LSP would subsidary run an other priate fleet, Cleon will have
	his own, as any other. Anybody will be interested that the
	backwater planets dont have SDBs to have a playground for
	their hidden subsidaries. And its clear that a pirate has to
	become hunted down when he left comon practice and starts
	to block habours. Hey nobody should give those Kaneshis the
	idea that they need an SDB.

No, she is not going to die...permanently.  Her contract dispute didn\'t
come up until after they had finished filming both of the TNT movies and
all of season 4, including the FINAL episode of the series, which she will
be in.

According to what JMS said at WorldCon in September, just because of a
dispute, he is not going to go and mess with an episode that is already in
the can.

Sorry this is a questiion prompted by a statement so long ago...but I\'m

This book is not Traveller, but it is a great book nevertherless. They
actually did a series of them -- not just spacecraft, but travel guides and
the like. They are out of print now, but I wish I could get ahold of them.

IIRC, they featured a lot of artwork by Chris Foss and artists with similar
styles.

In Traveller, there are no natives of Alpha and Proxima Centauri.

_Spacecraft 2000 to 2100 A.D._ by Stewart Cowley

The only relation this book has with Traveller is that many of the
illustrations in this book and in T4 are done by the same artist.  The
book has no bearing or relation to Traveller, having been published a
number of years ago (1978 by my copy).  

Many of the illustration are by Chris Foss.  The powers-that-be at IG
decided that Foss art would work for Traveller.  Many on this list do not
share such feelings.

There are a couple of other books in this series: _Starliners: Commercial
Spacecraft in 2200AD_ and, I believe, another one about aliens races.

Each book seems to be only a project to allow some really neat artwork to
be published.  By all means, steal ideas, ship designs, company names, etc
from them (I have), but the books themselves have nothing to do with
Traveller.

I have this picture of a student being obnoxious and the lecturer
pushing a button on the lectern. The class watches open mouthed as a
beam flashes down from the ceiling turning the student into a small
pile of ash. Then the lecturer looks at the class and says "Any more

The biggest advantage is that they\'re harder to hide from. Shutting down
your power plant, parking in the shadow of an asteroid, will make a 
ship (especially a masked one with a military black or ultrablack hull) 
almost undetectable on passive sensors. Even just shutting down the power plant
often makes ships very hard to see with passives...but still detectable on
actives. So, if you light up your actives, you can guarantee you\'ll detect
almost anything within their range, no matter what - but you\'ve also announced
your presence to the whole solar system. 

The other class of active sensor that is very important is LIDAR - it\'s be
best way for small ships to get fire control locks. In fact, if converting
old-style designs, I would gernally feel free to add a LIDAR to all of 
them - a small one for civilians and a big one for military.

Possibly the rules are going to get tweaked to make active sensors more
useful for fire control solutions, too.

Well, there are *two* things to consider. First is the area loading of
the landing pads (weight of ship divided by area of the landing pads).
A ship not *designed* to set down on "soft" surfaces will have too high
a loading, and the pads will sink in.

Second, there\'s the matter of having to worry about the "quality" of
the surface. That\'s a combo of both how even the surface is (that tall
grass on the prairies or steppes can hide some *huge* holes) and how
consistent the surface is. That is, is the strength of the surface the
same or are some parts softer than others.

And of course, if you are using a reaction drive, you want to use rock
or a prepared field anyway, so as to not excessively damage things.

OK, I finished the post this time...so this is a legit. question.....

How do you prevent this overdrive from being used in ship combat?   400%
for 5 min.  40% for several days.  Interpolating (quickly in my head)
gives that a 300% to 200% overdrive might be possible during a combat
situation.  And even if there is wear and tear on the M-drive for doing
so....if I\'m losing a few MCr for each hit I take from an enemy ship, it
might be worth a little overdrive to end the battle quicker.......

Or is this the sort of decision making that you wanted to allow all
along? :-}

I\'m toying with the idea in my campaign of not having overdrive.....if
you have a cheap ship with only 1G....you gotta use a >1G shuttle to get
to and from the surface of planets bigger than size 8.

Yes.  I have never disagreed with the idea that pirates do not operate in
worlds with Class A or B starports, or with the infrastructure (Stellar
TL) to support a decent SBD force.

That does not, however, mean that they do not identify potential victims
at these ports, they just don\'t attack them there.

I think it would be fair to include the 10% in the 50% I\'ve arbitrarily

With BIG ships.  BatRons for Battles, CruRons to support Strikes and
Battles, Monitors and Battle Riders for Seiges, and DesRons for screening
and scout work in interdicted systems.

But, as I\'ve said, by the numbers there is no argument.  Raw numbers say
that the Imperium can do it.  I\'m arguing that the potential to do it,
does not translate into the will to do it.  And, as I pointed out, my
arguments are straying toward the \'campaign specific\'.

However, my statements about the support base ARE canon.  And I\'ve yet to
get a specific, long-term solution that is cost effective.

It is easy, using paper ships and crews, to wave your hand and deploy
ships away from homeport for extended periods of time.  It is a much more
difficult thing to make it happen with real ships and human crews.  Having
lived that life for 9 years, trust me when I say there are REAL problems
with that.

I used low-tech worlds as an example because, IMHO, the tensions would be
exagerated there.  However, I feel the dissatisfaction with the Imperium
could extend much, much higher.  Look at how the worlds banded together
into factions against central authority during the MT Rebellion.

IN, maybe, maybe not.  Subsector - probably.  Planetary, almost certainly
(unless the planet is a High Stellar world...)  It depends on what the
Subsector and Planetary Navies have access to.  The IN can pick and choose
it\'s manufactoring bases with a great deal more care.

It also had a very good explanation of _why_ Earth\'s complaint
was mostly bogus - the short form is: if you work it out, most of
the water will end up right back on Earth - it\'s used to get out
of that damn gravity well.

   Lost in the piracy discussions is reality that space is a *big*
place.  There\'s no way that a single ship of any kind could adequately
patrol an entire star system all by itself.

   Pirates would survive because of the vastness of space, and because
of the likelihood that corrupt starport officials would allow pirates to
use their facilities.  Pirates would be much less common (probably
non-existent) in the Imperial interior, more common along the frontier
where things are less settled (and there are ports outside of Imperial
space).

   William and King Harald of Norway (who supported Harold\'s brother as
King of England) planned their invasions without prior knowledge of the
other\'s actions.  They weren\'t even allies.  Had King Harald managed to
defeat King Harold, it would have merely changed one of the competitors
in the finals at Hastings.

   Harold force marched his troops unnecessarily because he was afraid
that William was moving much faster than he actually was.

   Well actually William sent his mounted troops out in front of the
rest of his lines to skirmish and then pretend to retreat in a
deliberate attempt to lure the Anglo-Saxon infantry out of formation. 
The trick worked.  As the Anglo-Saxons advanced piecemeal across the
field, they were cut down.  Harold\'s lines now in total chaos, William\'s
archers let loose with arrows to further exploit the situation.  One of
their arrows found Harold\'s eye socket. 

   The battle was suppose to be one of the hallmarks of the ascension of
calvary to dominance in the Middle Ages.  In fact had Harold\'s troops
maintained their discipline, the ending could have been dramatically
different.

   Well actually it was more a case of William being the last man
standing in a fight for the throne.  The English of 1066 fell in line
like the good subjects they were supposed to be.  If this had been 1642,
the story would have ended somewhat differently...

invading England...unattractive.  Of course now that the Chunnel is

As a tangent to the current thread regarding the use of sensors within a
star system, perhaps I can ask a further question:

How does the "Sensors" skill interact with the technology of the sensors
themselves in Traveller?  If sensor displays are similar to today\'s air
traffic controller set-ups (big round sweeping graphic displays with Z-axis
information provided numerically), most unskilled individuals can pick a
blip on such a display and have a very good idea as to it\'s range and
bearing (passive sensors might be a bit harder).  IOW, the equipment itself
provides much of the "skill".  To what affect does a character\'s sensor
skill improve one\'s chances when using ship\'s sensors?

This may sound like a stupid question, but I am just interested in a few
examples as to how two people with different skill ratings-- looking at the
same sensor display-- can acquire different levels of information.

Jamming and passive sensors, OTOH, are a different story.

Ok, here comes the old history teacher to the rescue. ;->

Bruce\'s account took some liberties with the details, but it was a very
interesting read.  Scott\'s account was more accurate.  IAC, the events of
1066 are open to some interpretation.

It is very likely that William knew that Harold, King of Norway and Tostig
(Harold of England\'s brother) the ousted Earl of Northumbria were planning
to invade England.  King Edward had died in January and it was no secret
that Hardaade wanted the conquer England.  It is also *possible*, but not
likely, that William and Hardaade were secretly allies. 

Hardaade wanted to conquer and rule all of England (Tostig would have been
made Earl of Northumbria), and William believed that he had a rightful
claim to the throne.  So it\'s unlikely those two could have been real
allies.  In fact, during the spring and early summer Tostig lead several
Norman raids in the south of England, so Tostig was a link between the
ambitions of both Hardaade and William.  Tostig was probably playing the
two of them off against each other and against his brother Harold.

William had been organizing his army since January and landed his army in
England as soon as he was able.  He wanted to invade in midsummer, but
winds kept his fleet in port until the end of September.  He wasn\'t
explicitly waiting for the attack in the north to take place, and it\'s very
possible that William didn\'t even know Hardaade had actually invaded in
early September.  However, once William got his army ashore he *did* find
out about the fighting in the north, and he used it to his advantage.

William didn\'t move forward to attack, instead he waited for the two
Harolds to beat each other up in the north, so he could defeat whichever
one survived.  That *was* smart.  

Harold defeated and killed Hardaade and Tostig at the Battle of Stamford
Bridge.  The Housecarls were badly hurt in the fighting, and the loyal
Northumbrian and Mercian levies were decimated during the fighting. This
all happened a few days before William\'s army landed in southern England.

Hearing of this Harold marched south with his exhausted housecals raising
as many levies as he could on the way, but was still badly outnumbered when
he went out to meet William\'s army.  Even so, Harold\'s defensive line at
the top of a ridge near Hastings proved to be *almost* enough to beat
William.

Several attacks on Harold\'s line were broken and rumors that William was
dead spread through his army after he was dehorsed in a charge up the hill. 
When William\'s left began to retreat the levies on Harold\'s right pursued. 
William, regaining his seat, ripped off his helmet and rode across his
retreating front rallying his troops.  He and his calvary then swept the
pursuing Anglo-Saxons from the field.  Still Harold\'s center and left held,
and continued to do so in the face of hard pressed attacks.  William
ordered fake retreats in the afternoon to lure more of Harold\'s levies out
of the line and to their deaths and although it worked to a small degree
Harold\'s line continued to hold.

William ordered his archers to begin high angle attacks so their arrows
would fall down into the shield wall, rather than be deflected, while he
continued frontal assaults on foot.  Harold\'s line continued to hold, but
*both* sides were becoming exhausted.  It could have gone either way, and
the likely result would have been a draw for the day. 

Then an unluckily (or lucky, depending on your point of view) arrow hit
Harold in the eye and he feel mortally wounded.  The English line began to
collapse without their leader, and by nightfall the Normans had taken the
field, chased down and killed most of the housecarls, and there was no
standing army in England except William\'s.  And the mopping up began.

You\'re talking about decimating a planets water supply.  Yes that would take

be near imposible to eliminate all water, BUT I\'m not talking about removing
*all* water, just enough to be noticed.  And since we notice changes in the
Earths environment now, when all we are doing is redistributing things rather
than removing them, how much more so would it be noticed if  just one
*million* tons were completely *removed* from the Earth?  It would make an
impact upon the bioshpere (not much because planets are extremly Zen, and

be relatively easy to remove a million tons in say 20 years.  A Far

I disagree.  Noticable is very subjective.  I\'m not saying that planets will

Sometimes you use actives to make sure the other side *knows* that you
know they are there. 

They can also be used to indicate that you think you are the biggest,
baddest thing in the area. That is, that you don\'t think that you need
to worry about announcing your location. This can even be a form of
bluff. :-)

Again, due to the way turning works in space, you only get major
stresses along the thrust axis. It doesn\'t take that long for even low
thust "steering jets" will turn a ship end for end in a reasonable
amount of time.

The cargo will be containerized. And thus it\'ll be set up for automatic

Since you are in free-fall, you don\'t *need* grav vehicles. And I\'m
willing to bet that there\'d be a fairly cheap "adapter" for connecting
the cargo "ports" of two ships for transferring cargo in space.

There\'s a huge difference between U.S. Navy and the Imperium.  Being

Sure you will. In case you weren\'t aware of it, that actor had a
contract dispute and was dropped because of that. So, like any show
where that happens, they write the character out of the show.

Remember Henry Blake on M*A*S*H?

Don\'t forget that the sideways vectors aren\'t all that big in a
spacecraft. It\'s not like an airplane where you get significant side
forces just from the act of turning. The major forces on a spaceship
will *always* be aligned with the thrust axis. The steering jets (or
whatever) produce much smaller sideways forces, even in a combat ship.

I still think that the wind forces get prohibitive. Especially
considering that it\'s quite possible for things like wind shear to rip
apart a ship not designed for them. You can have the wind force
affecting the ship change *drasticly* in only a few meters.

   OK, I\'ll say it, since others can\'t see to:

   ***SPOILER ALERT***

   Just how many long-time female characters do you think are on the
damn station?  <geesh!>

   Well anyway, "the female in question who\'s name may start with the
letter \'I\'" appears in the FINAL episode (which was filmed out of
sequence in case the other contract problem B5 had wasn\'t resolved), and
in the last episodes of the 4th season.  I was my understanding that she
is not in any of the new material produced for TNT.  How they plan to
bring her back is a very good question, if they did in fact have her die
on screen.

Well, I make it usable only in low orbit, or lower, and it requires
some preparation (longer than the PC\'s have in battle) to be used
safely.  Not airtight, but it\'s managed so far.

In addition, you can also make a copper/silver alloy which is pink (I worked
in a jewelry studio for a couple years).  I didn\'t like the color, but it is
genuinely pink.

Also, using modern day (early TL9?) "nanophase" techniques, you can quite
literally make just about any metal or ceramic (and some other materials as
well) have different visual properties.  I read it in an article in
Scientific American, can\'t remember the issue number though.  They were
making _very_ opaque ceramics, and they said you could do the same with
metals and such.  The technique was truly fascinating.

Not trying to just be contrary, but I could have sworn Mos Eisley was a
studio backlot.  I seem to remember seeing a "making of Star Wars" type
program when I was younger.  And other than that, there were very few desert
scenes with stormtroopers in the original Star Wars.

I can believe they had a small fan.  I would doubt they spent hours in those
suits in the desert, even with fans and a cold tent.  I guess anything is
possible though.

ARRGHH... Kenneth! I stopped reading the B5 newsgroups for this very
reason..... we in Aust dont see that season for at least two more years,
they have only just finished season three here!!!! (luckily I have been
able to see most of season four, but not the last few episodes) 

You\'ve done it now..... I am now wracking my brains trying to think of
possibilities, aaarrrgghhh!!

>One of the top stars of B5 was hurt tonight,and will be killed off in

OOOHHHHH NOOOOOOOO!!!! I won\'t ask....I won\'t ask....I won\'t ask....I won\'t
ask
(sob)
 


>This show is truly amazing.  You\'d never see this on Star Trek.

I have to agree.... I am completely addicted to the show.... But you would
see it on Star Trek.... but only after it\'s been done on B5.... still for
that reason alone DS9 is becoming very interesting.

I have a campaign going at the moment where we use traveller rules to play
B5. (home grown starship combat). Only two players...both EA starship
captains but I ahve managed to manipulate it so that at the so that for the
moment they are both on opposite sides of the civil war.... (although one
is only on Clarks side because he hasn\'t found the opportunity to escape yet)

I had heaps of fun, sending there ships as part of a squadron to the Io
transfer point to capture the Alexander and General Haig. 
One captian (light cruiser) defected at once (after rounding up the
nightwatch personel on his ship... some viscious gunfights there), and
threw the squadron into chaos. The other player (in charge of an Omega
Class Carrier) was placed in charge of the squadron. He was desperately
trying to avoid conflict, let his friend escape, while keeping the other
starship commanders pacified. He eventually committed some heavy cruisers
to try to stop Haig... in particular the Excaliber and the Swartchcoff....
He did that on purpose... I had a good laugh about that....naturally after
that was done... I had to let Haig escape... I mean... that\'s what the ISN
said had happened.  

Of course, that is the last time I was going to be so kind... from here on
in the combat goes wihtout any "deus ex machina" from the ref....
The Omega captain is nect going to B5, with orders to arrest the command
staff and take over!!! Whatever happens here happens... except that I don\'t
think those four last minute jump points will contain Minbari ships <bwwaa
ha ha ha>

Hmmm... see what starting a conversation about B5 does to me.... I\'ll
ramble on forever if you let me!

If it takes "a few seconds" to turn, you are far more likely to be hit by someone

Anyone stupid enough to *try* using the Chunnel to invade deserves what

No, at least in the inner system, you\'ll still detect that sort of
thing, it\'s just that a ship lurking at zip power will look a lot like
a large meteoroid to passive sensors.

Anyone wanting a good example of using sensor ops skill in *very*

They look pretty. That\'s the whole idea. After all, it was jewelers who
came up with them. 

Red gold is unlikely to be a better conductor than copper, as gold is a
*worse* conductor than copper. Silver is better than copper. So green
gold *might* be as good as copper , but more corrosion resistant.

That\'s the main reason gold is used *at all* in electronics. It doesn\'t
corrode. And for micro circuitry, it\'s useful for hooking between the
actual chip inside the package and the pins. That\'s because it\'s so
malleable and ductile.

Of course, these might be good for some strange reason (why is
lanthanum good for jump grids?)

Doesn\'t all armed ships have a pretty powerful LIDAR built in?
Its called a lasergun and the reflected signal from unfocussed or focussed
shots can be read by the passives.
Why not use passive sensors to boost lasercomm reception? the same can be
said about radar dishes and microwave radios.

You\'ll get range info faster/at lower signal to noise ratio but with
weapons shooting with c or near c speeds that is not as important. As the
range drops off at 1/r^4 instaed of 1/r^2 it is VERY easy to detect targets
close by. Missiles etc will have a hard time getting close to your ship
without detection when you\'re on active. Finally, active sensors are VERY
effective when your targets are REALLY close: If those pesky pirates are
jetpacking over to your ship and they\'ve disabled your guns hit them with
the radar. A few MW of microwave power will make them crisp on the outside
an jummy on the inside ;)

No it wouldn\'t. A million tons of water is a cube 100 meters on a side.
That\'s *trivial*. We get more material than that infalling from meteors
every year. And I\'d not be surprised to find that we lose that much
water to photo-dissociation in a year.

Remember, *all* the oxygen currently in the atmosphere used to be part
of water molecules. The oxygen in the CO2 molecules went into the sugar
formed by photosynthesis.

But a million tons is not even .00001%. On that 6000 km radius planet
it is 2 *nanometers* of ocean depth (ie 2 one-millionths of a
millimeter). You just don\'t understand the *scale* of this sort of
thing. Figuring with the one km deep "planetary ocean" (I think earth\'s
would be even deeper), I get .0000000002%.

We probably convert more water to hydrogen and oxygen in various
industrial processes.

No offense but you are worrying about the equivalent of taking a grain
of sand from the Sahara desert.

And you also are suffering from the impression that the biosphere is
*stable*. Far from it. It\'s in *dynamic* equilibrium. Quite a dufferent
thing. The worst ecological disaster known was when photosynthesis was
invented by cyanobacteria. They dumped *quintilions* (10^18) of tons of
deadly poison unto the environment. That killed off the mjority of all
living things. A few adapted to the poisonous oxygen atmosphere. And
the change in atmospheric chemistry caused *massive* erosion. Yet the
biosphere not only survived, it\'s now far more diverse than it was
before this catastrophe.

I started to object that the SDB could *shoot* the pirate from a lot
farther awat than an hour out. Then I realized that to do that, it\'d
have to be able to positively ID which ship was the victim. And be able
to fire with some assurance that it\'d miss the victim but still hit the
pirate. And that\'s not going to happen if the ships are grappled
together.

On the other hand, the pirate has to get close to the victim. Which
almost certainly involves deviating *greatly* from the flight path
assigned it by STC (Space Traffic Control).

At the point it deviates, both STC and any nearby ships are going on
alert, because the only reasons a ship has for doing that are an
emergency, or an attack. 

Once it starts shooting, it\'s obvious what it is, and at that time it\'s
still a *seperate* target. And can be fired upon.

So the pirate has to manage to make an attack run, dodge incoming fire,
and close with *and disable* the victim rather quickly. Otherwise he
gets shot to hell and picked up.

He also has to do this close enough to the 100 diameter limit that he
can jump safely after getting the cargo. Though I suppose that given
the other risks, pirates might accept the extra risk of jumping from
inside the 100 diameter limit.

It still requires a lot of luck and timing.

I think that what the pirates would be doing is *trying* to come out of
jump near one of the more likely *outgoing* jump areas. This isn\'t
suspicious, because given the known jump duration differences, ships
arrive all over the place outside the limit.

They\'d also need a ship capable of making *two* jumps without
refueling. That way they jump in, and if they get lucky and there\'s a
ship they have decent chance of intercepting, they attack it and if they
can disable it and close quickly enough to avoid fire from distant
ships, they transfer the cargo and jump out of there. 

If they have extra time, they can even try to space the crew and jump
the ship out (assuming that the jump drive was intact).

And if they run out of time before they get a chance to transfer cargo,
they jump empty-handed and hope for better luck next time.

If there isn\'t a likely target, they just proceed into port and sell
some cargo (probably high value low bulk so they\'ll have room for loot,
or else something easy to jettison but not very valuable say some sort
of liquid or gas).

Attacking on the way out is a lot more difficult, especially since the
locals will have entirely too much info about your ship (since you\'ll
have been to the port). You\'ll have been assigned a course that doesn\'t
go at all close to anybody else, which means that you\'ll be acting
*very* suspiciously for a lot longer. That greatly increase the chance
of you being fired upon at long range.

I think the best method is to combine piracy and hi-jacking. You place
some people aboard the target as passengers or crew, and get them to
try to take over the ship. Then you arrange for your ship to have a
flight path close to that of the target. So when the distress call goes
out, you can radio STC that you are going to the aid of the other ship.
That\'ll get you closer without raising *too* much suspicion. (even if
this is SOP for pirates, it\'s *also* SOP for armed merchants that
really *do* want to help nail hijackers). 

Then, if your confederates can disable the ship, your boarding party
can take it over (instead of helping the crew). And you both jump out.

If your buddies actually manage to take over, they can tight beam a
message to you so you can "accidentally" let them get away.

And if they fail, you can attack the ship while the crew is distracted.

A previous post by me (and later worked out in tabular form and put on a
website by Dave Golden) calculated the hit propability dependency of range
due to lightlag. If the ship can turn in no time compared to the lightlag
hitpropability scales as 1/r^4 due to lightlag but if a ships turning
ability is slow compared to lightlag the propability is only 1/r^2 which is
a huge difference. As combat ranges will be about 1 lightsecond as
calculated by Bruce Macintosh a ship will be much harder to hit while
evading if it can turn a significant amount in a second. The reason for
this is the difficulty of predicting where a ship will be a few seconds
into the future when it can be accelerating in any direction compared to
when it can only accelerate in one direction but vary its acceleration. If
the ships thrust agency has a slow throttle then it will be even easier to
hit but so far nobody has come up with good rules about throttle speed for
different types of drives (better still real world figures for presemt
thrusters such as turbojets etc of various sizes).

gives the SDB\'s time to arrive. Plus even if you can\'t sell the ship, it
can serve as a source of spare parts on the hoof; helping to ease the
problems of maintaince, life support supplies etc. Slight problem of what
to do with the crew of the victim, but well, we are talking about pirates.
As an aside, this is close to the MO of "classical" pirates. They\'d
capture a target and then sail it to a secluded cove and loot it at their
leisure. After all, why does the Corsair have that huge ship bay and why
are captured X-boat tenders so popular with pirates. Actually, I can see
some very interesting points from this. Firstly, if pirates exist, most
of their vessels will be stolen (if you can scrape together the deposit
for even a 2nd hand starship, you are not very likely to become a pirate);
pirates will mostly hit ships on their outbound leg, near the 100d limit
(but not too close); pirates will rely on stealth and quickly disabling
their target at short range (fusion guns or non-grav focused lasers);
pirate bases will be found in the outer fringes of a system (maybe even
the Oort cloud) and are likely to have the hulks of previous victims
scattered about, a slow distant comet would be ideal; and finally, with
this method, the pirates don\'t actually need a ship at all, just hijack
the ship and jump it somewhere.

As too the 3I\'s will to stamp out pirates; I think the best answer to
this is found in the oft repeated phrase "doesn\'t rule the worlds, only
the space between". Any threat to the safe transit of space is a direct
threat to the very legitimacy of the Imperium. Somehow, I\'d say the 3I
would take piracy *very* seriously. I\'d have to say the "logically"
piracy would only exist in the 3I under exceptional circumstances (the
Civil war, the Rebellion, M:0, the 3rd Frontier War [mentioned as being
characterised by widespread \'commerce raiding\']). However, pirates are a
very \'popular\' factor in the game and every referee I\'ve soken to is
quite willing to ignore this reality in favour of a more fun game.

More or less how I\'d handle it ... make it difficult and, semi, illegal ... and

OK, like I said, this is fine if you are talking a 1G USL merchie. What about a
6G USL Battlecruiser? It is, presumably, braced for violent changes of direction
and acceleration *in space* ... surely it can handle a few hundred kmh in
atmosphere without falling apart? OK, dispersed structures are obviously not
going to cut it, but a standard USL Wedge could do it, no probs.

And this is the way it should be! And that\'s all I was saying!

And since a USL ship has no real landing gear (after all, they are expected to
handle only z-gee landings most of the time), this is not a problem ... it
actually makes your task *easier*. The USL ship needs a site that simply is not
available within however long a distance suits the typical GM\'s nasty little
plans!

Arguably one of the *best* exiting scenes for any character.  Gary Burgoff
(Radar O\'Reiley) played out the scene in the OR delivering the bad news
absolutely perfect the first time, yet the director wanted another take of
it just to be sure.

        But isn\'t "pure unrefined fuel" hydrogen gas or liquid with some
impurities?
        Water is 88+% oxygen, not hydrogen! I\'d think you had to do some
refining to
        use it at all.

I am sorry to be obnoxious about this but I have just carefully examined my
copy of said book (I have had if for nearly twenty years. Sheesh I feel
old!) and Chris Foss is not credited for any of the art. Angus McKie, Jim
Burns, Colin Hay, Tony Roberts, Bob Layzell, Alan Daniels, and Peter
Goodfellow are however, so unless Mr. Foss operated under a pseudonym in
the seventies he had nothing to do with this book.

There maybe some stylistic effluences.

I whole-heartedly agree with Vanya here. This book has been a source of
inspiration for many years. Several of the illustrations have been used as
\'This is what you see\' sort of a thing. One of my particular favorites is a
work by Angus McKie described as the \'Miami Spaceport\'. It is an excellent
view of a starport or maybe an arcology.

     Most likely the book you have is not Traveller-related...Chris Foss (who
is the artist doing the current artwork on the covers) is a newcomer to Trav
art, AFAIK.  His style is very different from previous artists used in Trav
(Paul Jaquays being the one I remember most...am I old or what!  :-) )
 Personally I don\'t like Mr. Foss\' work, not because it isn\'t artistic (it\'s
very good) but it\'s just not how I see Traveller.  I guess I feel the same
way about Trav as I do about Star Trek:TNG and new cars...too many curves!!!

     AFAIK, there is nothing yet on the era of early Solomani exploration of
space (Terra discovered j-drive in AD 2087, contacting the Vilani Imperium
shortly after), but there are hints of a possible Milieu setting to be
forthcoming...I personally think it would be a fascinating time to play in!

Shades
        of 1984! I\'d rather have the pirates!

        Is it seriously proposed that there will exist (or could ever exist
in a 
        government run by human beings) a bureaucratic agency capable of
creating, 
        maintaining, and distributing any such list with any hope of success.

        Maybe -- when pigs fly!

        Of course, it exists. Yes, the resources to eradicate it exist. Just
        as the resources to eradicate mugging in New York City exist -- we 
        can put a cop every fifteen feet throughout the city. Voila! end of
        New York muggings. The good-ole U-S-of-A has the money, but I\'ll bet
        we find something better to spend it on. Okay, maybe we won\'t find
        something better, but we will find something else -- there\'s not much
        high-level graft in crime prevention.

        The problem of crime prevention is efficiency -- when does it become
        inefficient to prevent more of crime A when we could use the money to
        prevent crime B -- say, smuggling or illegal immigration or anything
        else you might think of.

        Comments on the list show that the Imperium has a huge amount of
        money to use for military and internal security and crime prevention.
        A huge amount, not an unlimited amount. If piracy gets out of hand in
        Sector Z, we\'ll send a fleet and squash\'em like the "cucrachas" they
        really are. When a new outbreak occurs over in Sector G, we\'ll crush
        them, too. The level of piracy will be non-existent in Sectors Z and
        G for a while, but there\'ll be some somewhere -- crime is like dirt,
        you can move it around but you really can\'t get rid of it.

In Classic Traveller ships used a fusion rocket.

My evidence:

The artwork by the Keith brothers clearly showed a rocket exhaust at the back
of the ship.  JTAS 5 had an article on Champa Starport, with landing pads,
blast berms, and pictures of ships coming down on their tails with flames out
the back.

High Guard allowed fighters to attack ships with their drives.  The drive was
counted as a fusion gun with a factor equal to its acceleration in Gs.  Given
that a fighter could only mount a factor-3 battery of guns, the drive was
actually more dangerous.  In fact, the classic fighter attack was a run in to
extremely close range followed by an attack with the drives.

OK, I finished the post this time...so this is a legit. question.....

How do you prevent this overdrive from being used in ship combat?   400%
for 5 min.  40% for several days.  Interpolating (quickly in my head)
gives that a 300% to 200% overdrive might be possible during a combat
situation.  And even if there is wear and tear on the M-drive for doing
so....if I\'m losing a few MCr for each hit I take from an enemy ship, it
might be worth a little overdrive to end the battle quicker.......

Or is this the sort of decision making that you wanted to allow all
along? :-}

I\'m toying with the idea in my campaign of not having overdrive.....if
you have a cheap ship with only 1G....you gotta use a >1G shuttle to get
to and from the surface of planets bigger than size 8.

OTOH, most ships/crews will probably spend most of their time in the same 
area (probably the same subsector, certainly the same sector - and SDBs will 
never leave their home system), so the chances are you *will* bump into the 
same ships often enough to build up a good picture. Sure, you could swap the 
ships around to confuse the enemy, but don\'t forget it works both ways.

IIRC the other two are _Space Battles_ and _Derelicts_ (I\'ve got all four 
sitting up in the loft, but I haven\'t seen them for years, so they might 
not be exactly right). Very nice books.

The main reason I argue to the point of stealing cargo is time, damage, and 
disposable wealth.  It takes time to batter a merchant into submission (I\'d 
have planted people aboard, but that\'s beside the point), and if a merchie 
knows he can get away with a minimum of damage and loss by dumping his 
cargo, he is more likely to cooperate (ie. not scream for help).

Damage is another issue.  Most merchants *are* armed, at least with 
pop-guns.  Not a real threat, but you never know when that lucky hit will 
take out the J-drive or P-plant.  Again, if the merchie cooperates, it\'s 
better for you, and you haven\'t killed the chicken that lays the eggs! 
 There is also the matter of by the time you take the ship, it\'s usually 
pretty beat up.  I\'ve been lucky in the past with crew kills, but they are 
by far the exception, not the rule.

Finally, while the ship *is* valuable, it is difficult to  dispose of. 
 Cargo is fairly simple.  Although, one of my player pointed out that if 
you stash the ship for a couple of years, then retire the pirate ship and 
start a "salvage" company, you stand to make some pretty big bucks...I\'ll 
have to watch that guy...

From what I\'ve seen it looks like both Sinclair and Innova (ok, I simply
*can\'t* spell today) are leaving the show.  Sinclair is elected Earth
President and isn\'t around, except for an occasional cameo, and Susan gets
a job off the station..maybe Haig\'s job.  I\'ve read that they are bringing
in a new female commander for B5, and the plots will revolve around whoever
she is.  What they are going to do about Delin and Sinclair, I don\'t know.
Of course all of this might be bunk, but it *is* what I\'ve read.

	I think these are our points of agreement.  If you don\'t disagree 
that by the numbers the Imperium can stamp out piracy then there\'s no 
point in going through the exercise of proving it numerically.  I\'m 
willing to leave it there and agree to disagree about whether the 
Imperium has the will to stamp out piracy.

Yeah, I agree. It\'d maybe suffer some wind shear and damage to antennae
that aren\'t designed to be retracted. High speeds might cause re-renty
heating problems. But the craft should survive because it\'s buillt tough. 

And you also said some other stuff I totally agree with.

	A TNE starship is a bit like an MS-DOS network where application

What do you mean by parking?
Geostationary? or merely not going to decay within set parameters eg MIR?

IIRC from school physics on angular momentum: There is a particular orbit
speed for each orbit height where the orbit is perpetual, not counting
atmospheric drag to bring you down again.
A geostationary orbit is the one where the particular speed gives a period
of rotation,  time for once round, exactly equal to the planets day length.

Given that you need to know the length of local single rotation, I dont
think you can work out a geostationary orbit radius but, of course, if you
do know day length then thats how long the geostationary ship takes to go
round.

Hmmm...I think that a straight cost modifier would be probably the best
way to go. The only way a designer wouldn\'t have control over ings like
\'ease of use\' is if they\'re TL limited...arguably a TL-8 auto is
_considerably_ easier to use than a TL-5 one, in many ways because of
technological changes (power steering, automatic transmissions, _starter
motors_!).

But a cheap cut-rate car is less likely to have these amenities. This will
affect ease of maintenence, too. The only way a random effect should come
into play should really be with randomly pregenerated things. "You go to
the rent-a-car office..all they have is a Shchoobie Lion and a Groshikin
Mudfish...of course you take the Mudfish because everyone knows that they
never did get the thruster control right on the lion...it handles like a
wallowing hovercraft."

But if you\'re _designing_ the craft, certainly you can do everythging
right, but it\'ll cost you, just like the real world.

Hey Rob,

Since I currently carry a burglar alarm for my car that is good for about
1/4-1/2 mile (manufacturer\'s claims not my own), and my car doen\'t cost as
much as a star ship I think this is a perfectly reasonable probability. The
signal should be audio/visual and radio, up to the limits of the
communicator carried by the crew.

Myxomatosis, a highly infectious viral rabit disease. It didn\'t kill them
all but it thinned them out. The trouble is the rabbits we have know are
pretty much immune. Just recently the CSIRO (government dept in charge of
such things) was a bit embarrassed when they "prematurely released" the
Rabit Calichi (? spelling) virus. It seems that birds flew from the test
zone on an island back to mainland Aust and started an epidemic that
spread. Caused lots of problems as all the rabbit based industries had been
planning on a release in 2-3 years time.

Although I like new car designs, your sentiment about Foss\' art is
shared by many on this list, including me.

I see IG making an effort, though, in this area.  The EA was the first
IG product to feature Bryan Gibson\'s art, which, IMNSHO, is very
Traveller.

I\'ve noticed Gibson\'s art becoming the interior standard for all IG
products since then (albeit Foss continues to capture the covers).

Remember that crappy (I guess I should say "non-Traveller" instead of
"crappy") interior art Foss developed for the main book and the CSC? 
Those were the last ones he did.  Now, Bryan Gibson is doing the
majority of the art, sharing the interiors with a couple other people.

BTW, I don\'t like the curvey designs in Trek ships now-a-days either. 
The Enterprise-E looks OK, but it sure doesn\'t hold a wink to the
Enterprise-A.

The weapons lasers aren\'t really optimized for this sort of thing - 
too low a duty cycle, etc. It
is easier to imagine dedicated LIDARs.

Something I do with I had thought of in time for FFS2 is using LIDAR
hardware to light up targets for the main passive sensors - it\'s not
actually that hard to write rules for; maybe it\'ll make it into the next
sensor rule iteration, if I ever have time to run the appropriate
simulation.

It probably won\'t ever matter too much; most Traveller transmitters and
recievers are so powerful you can pretty much hear each other across the
whole system...making communication gear more reasonable (no more 
megawatt-power radios for talking at interplanetary ranges) was one of the
nice things in FFS2.

I was under the impression that that Radar\'s \'performance\' was in fact real:
no one had been told the ending sequence until Burgoff was handed the

Even the actor playing Henry Blake did not know how final his exit was until

=================================================================================

(the following is reposted information from my game)



So far, there have been 5 posts detailing information you should know
about the March Harrier.  

Those topics have been:

Hull
Hull addendum

Avionics



This is post number six, detailing the equipment used on the March
Harrier.
============================================================================

SENSORS



The March Harrier mounts two sensor packages--one for passive
scanning/locks and one for active scanning/locks.  

The majority of the sensor equipment (sans some antennas and other
sensor electronics located elsewhere for various reasons) is located in
a sensor dome, on the dorsal spine of the ship near the nose, right
above the bridge.  You can see a good picture of the March Harrier,
featuring this sensor dome, on page 45 of DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s
Manual.



ACTIVE SENSORS (EMS Active Array):

Common to many civilian merchant vessels, the active sensor package used
on the Harrier is an EMS array.  EMS is an acronym for Electromagnetic
Spectrum.  This array is a collection of several different types of
specific sensors, related by the fact that they use some form of the
electromagnetic spectrum for operation.

By TL 10, most cultures use computer cross-correlation to integrate a
variety of electromagnetic sensors into one single sensor array.  This
specially designed unit is known as an EMS array.

The SOM describes EMS arrays:  "The EMS array is a series of integrated
sensors coupled to a computer, making the collection of specialized
sensors act as one sensor.  To the operator, the EMS array appears to be
one sensor dealing with much, if not all, of the electromagnetic
spectrum."

In other words, the electromagnetic spectrum can be broken down into a
series of frequency bands.  Each specialized sensor uses a specific band
for its operations.  The data from these individual sensors are then
correlated by the computer and fed to the sensor operator\'s workstation.

Here\'s an idea of the type of information collected by an EMS sensor,
the frequencies searched by the specific sensors, and the deductions
made from that data--all of which is correlated in the computer giving
the sensor tech one detailed read out about the object of the entire
array\'s attention.

There\'s longwave and shortwave radio, used by the EMS sensor in the form
of radar for ranging information.  There\'s microwave radio, which gives
the sensor another option for radar type operations.  There\'s heat and
infrared sensors, which will detect thermal emissions from starship hull
radiators or even, if close enough (or hot enough), the heat from body
temperature.

Visible light is another set of frequencies used by the EMS sensor, so
if a starship can be seen with telescopes or other visual sensing
devices, the EMS sensor will incorporate that data into the operator\'s
information.  Ultraviolet light is also used, as is X-rays and Gamma
rays--all providing visual information to the sensor.

The active EMS array is used to detect objects, rather than sources,
which is the realm of the passive EMS array.  The active array can
provide an actual image of the object in question (starship, asteroid,
or whatever).  The passive array will only provide information implying
what is behind the source.

The active array works by transmitting its own electromagnetic energy
(radio/radar waves, for example) and bouncing it off an object.  The
active array then reads the reflectd energy and provides an image of the
object, as well as precise range reading.

Of course, the active EMS array is itself a source of electromagnetic
energy, and somebody else\'s passive EMS array might pick you up when you
use it.

The EMS active sensor is, physically, a long cylinder contained in the
sensor dome.



PASSIVE SENSORS (Passive EMS Array):

The passive sensors on the Harrier, the passive EMS array, operate using
the same types of sensors as the active EMS array (described above) sans
the sensors that actively send out energy.  For instance, radar is not
included in the passive EMS sensor package--only EMS sensors which do
not send out any energy of its own are included.

Passive EMS sensors simply read electromagnetic energy sent out by other
sources.  The Visual light sensors are a good example of this--they do
not send "anything" out to read, they simply sit there and try to "see"
what can be "seen".  If a ship can be read on high resolution thermal,
for instance, it is a good target for the EMS passive sensor.

The quality of what the passive sensor can tell you depends of the
quality of the signal being sent from the source.  If a ship is not
emitting very much heat, for example, the Heat/IR sensors may not pick
it up.

The passive EMS sensor is, physically, a long pipe-like boom, contained
in the sensor dome.



ACTIVE VS. PASSIVE EMS SENSORS:

Active sensors will generally provide more accurate information about
the target object and the range to that object, but at the expense of
telling everybody where you are (because of the sensor energy being
detected by other\'s passive sensors).

Passive sensors will allow you to remain hidden longer because they do
not emit any energy of their own, but the cost is less specific
information that is reliant on the signal produced by the target source.

Both the sensors mounted on the Harrier are TL 12 EMS sensor packages. 
The volume of both systems is 0.3 tons.  It takes 12.6 MW to run the
systems, and together, they cost Cr7,400,000 new.  Antennas and the
sensor dome take up 13 square meters of the hull\'s surface, and the
entire system generally uses up to 40% of the sensor operator\'s time.



GAME STATS:

The Harrier\'s USD for its sensors is:    2A 3P 0J

The Active EMS Array has a Sensitivity of 12
The Passive EMS Array has a Sensitivity of 14

The Harrier has an Active Signature for other\'s active sensors of +0.5
The Harrier has an Emitted Signature for other\'s passive sensors of 0
The Harrier has a Reflected Signature for other\'s passive sensors of
- -0.5

She will be played by the equally delectable Tracey Scoggins (some may
remember her from the first season of "Lois & Clark").  Claudia allegedly
left the series because she wanted to take time off to do some non-B5 stuff
(essentially removing her from a total of only 4 episodes).  JMS wanted her
to be in all 22 episodes of season five, and she eventually left.  The
kicker is that Tracey is allegedly only going to appear in 8 of the 22
episodes.  Kinda strange that they don\'t want to give one of their long
time cast members a few episodes off, and then go ahead and replace her
with someone that will appear in a little over one-third of the final
season.

Yep. (Well, *I* didn\'t) The consensus was "because it\'s canon" ... and the

How common do you think starships are?

There\'s a basic database back at the local naval base, and new updates get
sent by way of xboat routes.  With the sheer size of 3I computers and
storage, there\'d be no problem on that end either.

But, how common do you think starships are in a (late) 3I setting?

Um.  In my living room, I have a White Pages for the Greater Philadelphia
Area.  It has 1200+ pages, each page having about 400 listings on it.

Golly, that\'s alot.

Anyhow, there\'s roughly half a million listings in there!  It gets updated
and republished and distributed _on paper_.  Then, on the Internet, there are
some locations that I can get a listing anywhere in the U.S., from _millions
and millions_ of listings!  These places are also updated with varying
regularity...

Big lists can, do, and will exist into the future, and I see no reason why
not.

Ken,

     Glad to see I\'m not the only one who thinks that way about Trek...in a
similar vein, I seem to recall a book titled "The Star Trek Spaceflight
Chronology" by Stan and Fred Goldstien.  Now this is very ancient
history...takes me back to 7th grade (1980-81), but it provided tech specs on
various Federation starships up to the Refitted Enterprise (NCC-1701, from
ST: The Motionless Picture), and if I remember right in the very back was a
drawing (side view) of the "next generation" of Federation starship...it
looked to me at the time to be a beached whale of a ship (remember I was only
11...and Net Gen was 6-7yrs in the future...)  I believe now it was prob the
first rendition of Enterprise-D...can anyone confirm this?   I have never
seen this book since I returned it to the library at school (they threatened
to hold up my report card unless I returned all the "lost" books I had.)

    'body' => 'Some interesting stuff happened in my game the other night, which I thought
I\'d share with all of you out there.  It was a fast paced situation, which is
now known (in true Quentin Tarantino style):  The Marionette Incident.

Background:

The group is contracted to kidnap a businesswoman\'s rival for a week to make
him miss an important meeting.  Lifted right from "The Traveller Book" in the
patrons section.

The businessman that\'s coming into town has two bodyguards and a companion
robot.  The characters have run all the basic checks before the guy lands,
and figure out that he will have bodyguards with him.  However, what they
don\'t bank on is that the businessman will have a companion robot (read,
direct link to the police in case of emergency).

Dr. Maximillian, ex-scout, is watching the Starport for this guy.  The guy
comes in on the _Concordia_, and luckily Dr. Maximillian has some robotics
skill (he makes a task roll and sees the companion robot for what it is) and
he warns the other characters who are lying in wait for the businessman and
bodyguards of this new development.

The other characters panic in a big way.  Mass chaos and confusion, everybody
thinks their goose is cooked.  See, they can\'t make too much noise in the
hotel suite, or the hotel\'s computer will send security to check it out.  As
a result, they pretty much can\'t fire any of their guns.  They try to think
of ways to neutralize the companion, while making sure that the bodyguards
don\'t perforate them while they\'re doing it.

And the clock is ticking...

Someone half-remembers the CSC description of the companion bot.  The robot
is linked into the main database of the world, and much of the personality is
handled by this remote computer...  Or something to that effect.  I assume
that the businessman signed over his robot to the local branch of the
robo-company while inbound from 100 diameters.

Marcus Church, the group\'s resident computer specialist, gets a bright idea,
and a stroke short of genius.  First, he stops the robot from sending back
any information in the case of an emergency.  Then, he aks if he can possibly
take control of the robot.  "Why?" I innocently reply...  I want to see
exactly what he wants to do to see if I should allow it...

I don\'t want to spoil the surprise, but I nearly fell out of my chair
laughing.  I repeated the situation back to him 3 times to make sure that I
heard correctly before going back into full GM mode.

So, the situation.  There\'s Armand Tenserian, an ex-marine behind the couch
with an assault rifle poking out.  There\'s um...  I forget the name, an
ex-army soldier hiding in another section of the room, with his laser rifle
at the ready (the only weapon the party can fire without arousing suspicion).
 There\'s Laszlo Hollyfeld, a rogue type in the shadows with a knife (the only
item he got from chargen).  There\'s Marcus on the portacomp getting ready to
control the robot.  And downstairs, there\'s Esther Dickenscheitz in the
getaway gravcar...

Shortly, Dysan Savitri (the businessman) runs his keycard through the door
swipe.  The door clicks open.  He enters the room, followed by his guards.
 As the door begins to shut, the robot turns, wide-optical sensored with
fear!  "Look out behind you sir, armed assailants."  They bodyguards and
Dysan draw their weapons, spinning around.  The robot grapples one of the
guards...  who gets quickly batted down by Marcus.  In the confusion and
surprise Dysan swings around...  And finds he is outgunned and outnumbered.
 One of his bodyguards is holding his head and moaning on the floor, and the
other has his back turned on the whole situation.

He wisely decides to give up and give in.

However, an itchy trigure finger and a massive misunderstanding ends with one
of the guards dead, and yellow journalism all over the airwaves.  Especially
the programs like: "Renegade Robots, Could This Happen To You?" with a
dramatic reenactment of the situation.

Although there were several votes to kill the prisoner after they got paid,
cooler heads prevailed and instead put him into a rented grav car to spin
around the equator for 4 days and finally put him down in front of police
headquarters.   He was bound, but given access to water for the duration.

One of the characters was indentified however, and the week ended with the
characters trying to keep one jump ahead of the news and the authorities...

I have yet to think up new fun for this Monday.

Yes, but it is still on the planet and can always be redistributed in a
multitude of ways. What gets hauled off is no longer here at all.  But the
heart of my point is 
that *people* would decide that ocean refueling is not in their best
interest.  Think

ocean refueling.

You\'re right, I didn\'t understand the scale.  It\'s just that big numbers seem
so... 
well, BIG.  I was trying to support my opinion with numbers, and failed.
Oops.  
But my opinion remains.  Anyway, like I said above, it would be the people
who would not allow ocean refueling.  Just because we won\'t run out of oil in
our 
lifetime doesn\'t stop people from saying we\'re running out of oil.  Just
because 
the sun won\'t go nova in a thousand lifetimes doesn\'t stop us from saying
that 
we should explore space.  People do on occasion take the long view.  Add
money 
to the mix and its a done deal.  GG mining would add jobs to a planets
economy.  You would have dive pilots, freighter pilots, refinery workers, a
full starbase at the 
GG for the refinery since you don\'t want large amounts of hydrogen sitting
around planetside wating for PC\'s to shoot into it, you could even say that
any unofficial 
GG skimming is illegal and force ships that are just passing thru to refuel
at the 
GG starbase. "New Jobs For One And All!"(corporate propaganda)  So GG mining
could be very profitable if ocean refueling was banned.  I should have gone
this way the first time, and left those pesky *big* numbers alone. (He says
as he wonders 
just what he missed this time ;)

No, I do realize the biosphere can handle anything that humanity can throw at
it,

somewhere that some scientists had determined that the Earth once had a 400 
day year.  Anyone know anything about that?

  Well, there have been a number of attempts to eradicate them, but as yet,
there has been no 100% success rate solution.

  1. I _suspect_ that foxes were partly introduced to keep the rabbits down
     although, it could be for hunting. At any rate, they have done a much
     better job on sheep, and wallabies along with other small native
     mammals, than on the rabbits.
  2. Then they tried a disease called Mixomitosis. This certainly cut down
     the population, but didn\'t finish the job. I suspect an immunity was
     eventually developed by the rabbits. (vision of lab coated rabbits
     working away...) It also eliminated much of the market for rabbit meat
     in Australia pretty quickly too! :-)
  3. The latest attempt is another disease called Colisii virus. You might
     have heard about this one - it was CSIROs biggest sc**wup in a long time.
     It was released before testing was complete and spread of its own accord
     over much of Australia. The most common suggested transfer method is
     dead rabbit in back of ute! Strange how it jumps 500-1000Km into an
     isolated place like Broken Hill!

  At the end of all this, AFAIK, we still have a rabbit problem. It just
isn\'t quite as big as before. Oh yes one other method - a big market for
rabbit meat and fur. Although mainly fur since the 50s/60s when Mixo was
introduced.

  Anyway, back to your scheduled piracy debate.

  BTW: Any nominations for piracy as a done to death topic? If I grab the
summaries now, I can put it in the FAQ real quick.

  PS: Apologies for spelling of the various diseases. My Latin is abysmal!

Ya know, a ship is not streamlined, so it takes up a stationary orbit
around a planet.  The crew goes down in a shuttle or a lauch with the
cargo and tries to secure some more for another trip.

I need to figure out how long it takes a ship to orbit around the
planet.

I\'ve got my player\'s ship coming off the surface.  If they time it where
the other ship (the one in orbit that I\'m trying to figure) goes over
the planet\'s horizon, I want to figure out how much time they have
before the ship appears on the other side of the planet.

COMMUNICATIONS



The March Harrier incorporates two different comm systems.  Both are TL
12.  Total power for both systems totals 10.6 MW from the ship\'s power
plant.  Brand new, these two comm systems cost Cr300,000.  Hull area for
the antennas take up 101 square meters, and the comm system takes up 40%
of the communications officer\'s time.

The Harrier uses one tight beam and one broadcast comm system.



TL 12 RADIO COMM:

Broadcast communicators have the advantage over tight beam communicators
in that the precise location of the receiver need not be known.  This
type of comm is common everywhere--one just sends the message, and if
the receiver is in range, he will receive the transmission.

The problem with broadcast comms is that, if tuned into the proper
channel, anyone can listen in to your conversation or receive the data
being transmitted.  Also, broadcast transmissions are easier to jam.

Radio communication is a form of broadcast transmission.  Radio comms
send and receive information using radio waves.  The information is
broadcast (sending information out in all directions), and this
transmission can be detected by any radio tuned to the correct frequency
within range.

The Harrier uses a TL 12 Radio communicator, which it uses for most of
its transmissions.  The Radio comm is capable of 144 channels, and
standard range on this comm is 30,000 km.  Physically, the mount for
this device is a rod-like boom.

Radio communications can be detected by other ship\'s sensors.  Radio can
be detected by another radio, a radar direction finder, and an EMS
passive sensor array.  Radio can also be jammed.



TL 12 MASER COMM:

A maser communicator is a tight beam comm requiring the Harrier to know
the exact location of the receiver.  

A maser comm sends and receives information using microwaves.  The
information is beamcast--meaning it is directed at a specific set of
coordinates and can only be received by that receiver.  The maser is a
directional tightbeam version of a standard radio comm, but they are not
adversely affected by atmosphere. 

Although tightbeam communicators are more secure than broadcast, they
have the added problem of having to know the exact location in which to
direct the beam.

The Harrier mounts a TL 12 maser communicator, which has a standard
range of 1000 AU.  The maser comm has 144 channels, and the comm mount
is a series of conical boxes and cylinders on the hull.

Maser communications can be detected by another starship\'s passive EMS
array, but a maser communicator, once locked on to its receiver, cannot
be jammed.  Maser detection is only possible if the detector is "in
beam", meaning that the  maser is a pretty safe communication method in
a combat situation. 



INSYSTEM COMMUNICATIONS PROCEDURES

When a ship jumps into a new system, the comm officer will scan the
radio bands for the system\'s directory.  The exact location of which may
already be know from prior visits to the system, or may be obtained from
the subsector library program.

Most star systems, TL 8 and above, and all systems with a Class C or
better starport, maintain a communication directory on broadband radio. 
Once this directory is located, the ship\'s communication officer will
the local channels used for standard system information.

For example, starports maintain a Traffic Control Channel.  There may be
a standard Hailing channel.  There may be a standard Distress channel. 
Local entertainment may be broadcast from the main world--starships can
pipe this in for the passengers during the trip from jump point to
planet side.  Local news may also be carried on a standard channel, as
well as standard channels for commidity prices, commercial passage
reservations, and just about any other general information channels you
can think of.  

The variety of channels available is dependent on the specific system,
but some channels are standard in just about every system in the
Imperium.  For example, if the system is TL 8+, and/or the system has a
Class C+ starport, Traffic Control will be handled on its own channel.

Not all of the various channels mentioned above will be Image/Voice/Data
capable.  This is dependent on the requirements of the information being
broadcast and the equipment used to broadcast it.  In different star
systems, different types of broadcast will be made.

Traffic Control, for instance, is usually Voice only, although some
higher tech systems may use Images as well for real-time viewer
communication with the starport.  Entertainment channels, on the other
hand, are usually Image/Voice transmissions, although Voice only
entertainment channels are not unheard of.  Likewise, Market channels
usually transmit data only, providing stock quotes and commidity prices
to passenger and crew stateroom consoles.

Yes, Mos Eisley was a studio backlot. But the scenes *outside* of Mos
Eisley were filmed in Tunisia. Including the stuff with the Jawa

You need not just the planet\'s size code, but also the altitude of the
orbit. After all, both the Space Shuttle and the moon orbit earth. But
one takes 90 minutes, the other takes 29 days.

Please keep in mind that "turning the ship" (ie changing the direction
it\'s pointing) is quite different from changing course (changing the
direction it is *moving*).

Changing course takes a *lot* of time, even if you can spin the ship
like a top. You can\'t "redirect" your velocity in a new direction the
way ships and planes do. Instead you have to *kill* the velocity in the
old direction and build up velocity in the new one.

Actually, considering the fun they had with the fire in their a while
back, I\'d say a combo of poison gas and heavy smoke would do wonders.
Even if you button up and go to full anti-gas measures, the smoke means
that you\'ll have to *crawl* thru the tunnel. Especially since any
commander worth his pay will be *expecting* an ambush at that point.

	When I take a look on the 4 Traveller settings - Piracy exists

	CT - Spinward Marches was a frontier, its canon to sell stolen
	     vessels to the Sword Worlds
	MT - In the Rebellion, nearly anybody was a pirate, and a free
	     trader had "hard times" because the pirates called themself
	     legitime under the command of a backwater duke.
	TNE- Does also know slavery. The Guild knows there is one real

	First of all : The early 3I does not have a SDG-Transponder,
	(Deyo-Circuit) it was installed between 1086 and 1098 with
	a passage of enabling laws.

	Next: The Transponder is full time connected to computer,
	sensors and control system, and using the any free frequencies
	of the radio chanal around the clock, to chat with other
	Transponders. The Transponder was NOT a high tech computer
	with state of the art encrytion, only sending a squawk
	when the startport ask\'s for identity, bu a living and
	intelligent being. This being was connected to the ship
	full time, and chatting with other transponders about.

	So starport personal, could not only see, the name and
	ID of the ship, but also what weaponry is installed when
	it was used, how often crew is drunk, and wether the stuard
	makes sex to the passengers. Military ships where able to
	shut down the radio connection of the transponder (but not
	the internal computer connection - the transponder was
	installed into the mainframe) so any ship not sending a
	transponder signal was automaticly asumed hostage.

	The early 3I dosnt need a transponder, only TL12 Sota
	public encription software. So starport personal only
	need a list of "signers", and a ship has to send a
	standart data package, signed by a valid authority,
	the so called ship ID package, containing :

	- Name of the Ship with serial number, Brutto Register
	  Tons (not displacement tons), and signature on EMS/HRT.
	- Name of the owner, Name of the Bank, Last Payment,
	  Bank expiry, Name of the Captain, ...

	Any time information in the package is changed, e.g.
	because the thursters needed a overhaul, the package
	is encapsulated in a new package containing updated
	informations.

	It would be comon practice that this ship package is
	encapsulated an other time when a ship leaves a
	starport, to add the cargo list.

	There has been a lot of work on this over on the gdw-beta list in
the past and some of us are interested in starting it up again.  David
Golden has the basic equations on his web page for the case where the
ship\'s orientation is not known.  Introducing slewing speed complicates
things a bit and some other projects intervened before we got that far. 
We did establish, though, that the limit on a ship\'s slewing speed was not
only the thrust available but the structural strength of the ship.  The
result of all this would be a fairly complicated equation with lots of
exponents that gave us realistic hit probabilities for a given ship size,
range, acceleration, and agility.  Transforming this into a combat system 
playable without a programmable calculator would be challenging but 
rewarding.
	If you\'re interested in helping to restart this discussion then 
I\'d suggest you join the beta list by sending a msg to gdw-beta@qrc.com.

I think Leonard is correct. You want a closer orbit than Geostationary.
Just choose a time period that is convenient.  The Shuttle orbits at about
100 to 200 miles out and goes around in about 90 mins.  But of course the
world turns underneath and the orbit is at an angle to the tilt of the
world thus each orbit does not cover exactly the previous one and you get
those sine wave across the space traffic control map in the Starport
control. For the Earth the orbits are about 1000 to 1500 miles apart across
the face of the globe. The party coming up from the planet will have to
allow for that when they return.  Returning after 90 mins (difficult to do)
the ship will be some 1000 miles up spin. After 3 hours it will be 2000
miles away and may be over the horizon.

If the players don\'t remember about the planets rotation presumably space
traffic control will but Kirk\'s advice to the cloaked Bird of Prey crew
springs to mind.

Ahem. Kenneth didn\'t really do a spoiler. By defining the character\'s sex

Cut many webbing straps recently in zero G? Still takes time, say a minute
or two. If you are under gravity it\'d be faster, but you have more mass and
inertia problems, and have to control the crippled ship\'s computer.
Meanwhile the remaining crew of the ship will be shooting at you or holed
up in the bridge or engineering.

Isofreight type boxes which still have mass and inertia? Need a fair bit of
effort, that would.

Takes time to set up, and I believe that you are underestimating the effort

If I was a captain of a ship expecting combat I would want the cargo
secured to avoid loosing it in the event of a hit on the ship.

Apart from the fact that system failures happen, and you may not have power

Okay, that sheds a different light (to a point).You will need a receipt

Yes but *not* deployable in 15min...

In summary: I am not arguing that a fast unload is not possible, just that
the timescales you are both proposing are grossly optimistic. I can\'t help
but look at it from a practical view point and 15 to 30 min is just too
short IMO. However, I can\'t predict that future handling equipment that the
Imperium would have so there\'s space for the differences between our three
respective Traveller Universes.

   Hi.
   
   Someone wanted to know how long it took to orbit a planet.
   The answer is, depending on the orbit altitude, anywhere from
   a little over an hour to as long as you like.  This assumes
   that your ship\'s thrusters are not firing.  If they are, then
   you can decrease the minimum time to mere minutes.
   
   Oddly enough, this answer does not depend on the planet\'s size,
   but only on its being spherical and approximately earthlike
   in density.  A dense planet can be orbited more quickly.  If a
   world is twice as dense as Earth, then it can be orbited in
   half the time.  If it is 1/5th as dense as the earth (say, a gas
   giant) then it will take 5 times as long to orbit.
   
   Hope this helps.

Yes, I know that.  But, if I am dodging in combat, the "to hit" calculations 
have been done, so I believe, on the basis that the ship could be anywhere 
within a given sphere (for a certain G rating) - because it is assumed, for 
simplicity, that turning takes no time.  If you can only turn slowly, then your 
predicted location cannot be as far to the "side", making the probability of 
hitting the ship higher.  

If I chase a ship for a while so that I am "behind", relative to the ships main 
vector), then if the target alters acceleration along that same direction it 
will not avoid laser fire (but will still be effective as a dodging 
method against meson gun internal hits).  If the target tries to turn then it 
will (during that time) be much easier to hit.  If I am within (say) 1 light 
second, and the ship can only turn 10 dwgrees per second with side thrusters, 
then my high ROF laser has a good chance to hit ... assuming my sensors will 
give me a targetting solution that quickly.

I was just wondering if someone on the TML had done these sorts of 
calculations, or could argume that rate of turn is not a significant factor in 
the agility of a ship (agility = DM to avoid being hit).

I have always favoured the idea that a ship can use some of it\'s G rating for 
dodging (agility) and the rest for changing course - obviously "dodging" 
involves lots of course changes, but these all cancel out (a bit like jinxing 
an atmospheric fighter).  Using 3G for dodging could mean that I do not use 
that 3 G at all - a valid dodging technique in Newtonian movement systems.

Just look at modern high performance (production) cars - $100,000 for a car with 
poor ease-of-use (but high "pleasure of use" :-).  If we were to read car 
reviews, I\'m sure we would find lots of "handles like a pig" / "handles like a 
dream" references that are relatively unrelated to cost.  I think that the 
seeming randomness is well reflected by a dice roll.  A vehicle can have some 
DM\'s on this dice roll by adding ease-of-use features (remember, -ive numbers 
mean something is easier to use):

Propulsion TL is 1 or 2 above min: -1
Propulsion TL is 3+ above min: -2

Cramped pilot station: +1
Roomy pilot station: -1

Propulsion + 5% cost: -1
Propulsion + 10% cost: -2 (maximum allowed)

Roadgrid: -2

A referee can add manufacturer-specific modifers for his campaign:
LSP: -1
FSY: +3 (+6 for hot-wired grav pogo-sticks)
All: +2 for bootlegger speed enhancement (BSE) system

If you prefer not to have a dice roll, I suggest a base Ease of Use of +2, with 
modifiers as given above.

Here is a comparison of the old wheeled ATV (built several TLs above the base 
TL) and the new leading-edge CG-assisted ATV mentioned in an old JTAS article:

"The Grav-assist ATV seemed like such a good idea when he saw the advert in the 
TAS Journal.  He knew he should have known better.  The old wheeled ATV had many 
refinements which had to been discarded to cope with the requirements of the CG 
system.  OK, so he could cross a ravine with ease, but the old winch system had 
many additional uses beacuse it had been so powerful.  Sure, the new style of 
tyres lasted much longer, but they gave no proulsion in water - the twin 
propellers gave greater speed, sure - but they were forever getting blocked with 
kelp"

The new G-ATV losses the TL bonus (CG is the same TL as the vehicle) so is 2 
points worse on Ease of Use.  To keep the G-ATV cost competitive, the 
manufacturer has not included the +10% cost "refinements" in the G-ATV giving a 
further 2 point penalty.  In fact, this new G-ATV is a complete pig to drive!

   Interpretation of canon is not the issue.  No-one believes that piracy
   (past, present, and future) is not canonical.  Just that the rules
   regarding piracy, economics, and space combat are not mutually
   compatable.
   
   Some possible alterations to canon that might fix this compatablility
   issue:
   
   * Piracy does not prey on interstellar trade, but only on
   interplanetary trade (though even this is difficult to explain ---- See
   Steve Higginbotham\'s old posts on the subject.)  Canon /may/ support
   this fix.  The Traveller Adventure protrayed pirates as basically
   preying on belters.
   
   * Starship Combat is shorter ranged, faster, and more deadly than
   canonical combat.
   
   * Warships cost a lot more than merchants.  Or merchants are dirt
   cheap and carry valuable cargo at great risk (as opposed to canon
   where merchants are expensive and carry cheap cargo at essentially
   no risk).
   
   * Merchants must travel extensively though normal space, where they
   are vulnerable.
   
   Many other fixes are possible.  All of them (as far as I can tell)
   violate canon to some degree.

This was a point I made a while ago - in Traveller, ships just cost too
much per ton, and military grade ships do not cost that much more than
civilian ships.  This imples that fleets of military ships are very large,
compared to thier civilian bretheren.  Today, we do not have this
situation, as military shipos cost a hell of a lot more per ton, and
merchant ships are very, very big.

Note that Traveller ship transport costs about three times present day
prices, as a 2 traveller ton cargo container costs about $2k to ship
overseas, roughly.  A $150M container ship can hold about 1500 of these two
ton cargo containers, with a crew of roughly 20, and a lifetime of 15-20
years.  (Numbers gotten from a cargo shipper in Long Beach, and discussions
with the people at Bollinger, Newport News, and Alabama shipyards.)

A Traveller ship of the same capacity would be roughly a 4000 ton ship,
more or less, and would have a cost of roughly 2000MCr, assuming a cheap
ship.  Expensive drives make life even worse.

From this, T4 cargo shipment costs, ignoring all other expenses, are likely
to be perhaps 15 times as much, or $15K/ton. Converting from dollars to
credits is always exciting, but I have found using PCGNP a good emasure,
and by that, the average is about 10KCr, while it is about $30K in the US.
As a result, we should expect , therefore, that if Traveller cargo were to
cost what present day cargo does to ship, it would cost ~300Cr/Ton to ship,
while the ship cost leads to a price of 4500Cr/Ton.

Military ship costs are actually pretty comparable in present day, from
what I could glean from the web sites.  This makes more sense to me - if
merchant ships cost a 15th of what they do in T4, but military ships stayed
about the same, suddenly the military fleet would have a lot more ground to
cover.

There is stil the problem that a ship teleports instantaneously from one
port to another, without going out of range of the guns.

The answer is "pretty much anything the (owners) want. For an earth-sized
world the fastest orbit is once around every 90 minutes or so (the lowest
possible orbit) with travel time going up at greater radii; a popular orbit
would be geostationary orbit, about 25,000 miles out, once around every
24 hours so you stay over the same (equatorial) point on the planet\'s surface.

Where a "standard" parking orbit is is a good question. Geostationary has
advantages - being able to stay in constant contact with a ground stations -
but it\'ll be pretty crowded with comm satellites, etc. Low orbits - 90 minutes
to 120 minutes - will probably be the most common, since it\'s then
pretty quick to get down to the surface in your ship\'s boat. 
Orbits will be slower around smaller-than-earth planets.

This is for your "March Harrier" scenario, isn\'t it...are the players trying
to sneak in or sneak out?

I tend to agree.  Transferring a substantial cargo in space (even with both
ships working together) will probably take an hour or two.  A simple
handoff-transfer of a person or small package would be a 10 minutes
operation.

As you know, I\'m not a canonist.  In my games, the STL drive produces
pseudo-velocities (stutterjump) ranging from 6 to 60 light seconds per
hour.  Ships jump in and out at the "jumplimit" which is about 150 stellar
diameters (for Sol that\'s roughly 700 ls) out.  The "habitable zone" is
*usually* quite a ways further in, for Earth it\'s about 500ls.

It takes 6 to 36 hours (minimum) for a ship to move between the jumplimit
and normal habitable zones in a system.  This generally puts them as close
to some outer system planet (GG\'s for example) as the inner worlds when
they jump in, so refueling at GG\'s is relatively common when the ship
doesn\'t intend to trade with worlds in the inner zone.

Of course, all this varies depending on the system and the ship\'s
pseudo-speed, but we\'re still talking several hours of insystem travel.
System defenses have a *much* larger volume of space to cover and, on
average, much longer response times between when a SOS is sent and an SDB
can arrive to investigate.  This makes commerce raiding (and piracy) a
little more possible, especially in border, frontier, and contested areas.

The other point that bothers me is the long ranges for both sensors and
weapons we\'re seeing with the new rules.  It might be realistic to be able
to routinely detect ships at a couple hundred light seconds with passive
sensors, but that won\'t be happening in *my* games.  My STL drives aren\'t
large IR sources, and I\'ll come up with some way to reduce the
powerplant/lifesupport signature if I have to, too.  As for weapon ranges,
I think anything over 3 light seconds is approaching impossible (really
impossible) against a maneuvering target, especially targets that can move
at the pseudo-speeds that I\'m postulating.  Effective ranges should be much
shorter, maybe 1 to 2 light seconds, and that\'s the way I\'ll try to arrange
things.

Just my opinion on how things should work.

Some parts of this don\'t quite agree with the current view of how sensors
work and what they look like; here\'s my view, which might be useful.

The passive array is probably bigger than SOM describes. The bulk of
the array is spread out over the hull -there might be 10-20 reciever 
units, each about a meter in diameter, arranged over the hull and the wings
so that 5-10 are visible from any given facing. Each unit would be 
set flush into the hull, with a (retractable, mostly-transparent) cover
over the actual recieving elements; the receiving elements, and their
housing, are cooled to about -200 celsius by individual coolers (probably
thermoelectric) built into the unit. (This means that sensor sensitivity
is reduced when you\'re in an atmosphere, because the cover has to close and
the cover can\'t be cooled to these temperatures. It\'s also a good
flavour text for sensor damage - "we lost cooling on the port PEMS array,
captain" - losing cooling reduces IR sensitivity by 1-2 points.)

The multiple array elements operate together as a synthetic aperture
interferometer - essentially working as if they were one big telescope the
size of the whole ship, to achieve very high spatial resolution.
A PEMS-13.5 or so (which is probably about right - I think my previous
conversion table was to generous) has a resolution of 20 cm at 5000km,
so it can produce a moderately detailed image of a nearby ship. 

The active sensor array elements will similarly be spread out over the shp,
at least for military ships - a small civilian array llike this might be 
concentrated in one or two dishes. They will indeed operate pretty much like
you describe. It\'s worth noting that they will actually have worse 
resolution(ability to make detailed images) than the passive array, though,
since they mostly operate at radio/mm/sub-mm waves - even with extensive
computer processing of a bright/nearby target they\'ll probably only have a
resolution of 5-10m; at space combat regions all you detect with actives is
a fuzzy blob. 

Someday I would love to work on a T4 version of the SOM...I could
(for example) produce an image of what a T4 sensor array would see 
for various ships at various ranges, maybe color-coding the different 
wavelength channels (visible light for blue, near-IR for green, mid-IR
for red)...including the beam shape for the interferometer...but I 
probably don\'t have the time unless I was working on a project for money.

Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology: Stan Goldstien & Fred Goldstien,
illustrations by Rick Sternbach. From Pocket Books.

There were two "declassifed" speculative designs. SF101SW looks like one of
the Chris Foss illustrations. Lots of curves, humps and bumps that don\'t
really seem to go anywhere. Does not resemble the Enterprise D any more than
Tuna Factory resembles the Missouri. SF102SW is a little more angular.
Vaguely Star Wars Imperial Destroyer cross breeds with Klingon Battle Cruiser.

Actually, several of the early designs, up to about the time of the original
Enterprise design would work rather well for Traveller ships. Several Wdge,
and Dispersed Structure formats, and dimensions in metric!

    'body' => 'I\'m pretty much in the piracy-is-nearly-impossible as written regime;
but I can make a few suggestions for variations - in roughly increasing
order of canon-violation - for people who really want to add piracy:

(1) Big pirate ships: if you can capture whole merchant ships, you can 
    pay for quite a substantial pirate ship - a few captures of even
    subsidized liners per year could probably support a ship in the 1000-2000
    ton range, which is a substantial opponent for anything smaller than a
    destroyer. Such a big ship could carry enough extra fuel and jump
    capability to grapple ~400 ton victims - and maybe enough extra fuel 
    to refuel captured Jump-1 ships in empty hexes to allow travel a few
    parsecs to market. This does require
    (a) a market for captured ships - it only works in largely open and
        lawless frontier regions.
    It\'s also helped if you have
    (b) a very intimidating weapon to make victims surrender. One possibility
    is KKM - kinetic kill missiles. There\'s almost universal agreement 
    that a 1-dTon thruster-plate missile (which would impact at 
    several hundred km/s) would pretty much utterly destroy a medium-sized
    ship. Of course, there\'s also universal agreement that lasers can shoot
    such missiles down so easily that you need a huge swarm to hit a target...
    unless that target has no lasers; so if a pirate can disable the
    weapons of a victim it can threaten it with instant and total destruction,
    which would probably make most people surrender, especially if the pirates
    have a reputation for allowing prisoners to live.

(2) Dusty systems. Normal sensors can see ships at millions of km - but
    passive sensor sensitivity is strongly affected by how much dust is in
    the system. Young stars with very thick dust clouds might reduce all
    sensor ranges by a factor of 100 or so (this is in the advanced part of
    the DSR.) Of course that makes it harder for the pirate to find its target,
    but much harder for the SDB to find the (presumably stealthy) pirate.

(3) Sparse subsectors: as I suggested earlier, subsectors with few 
    habitable worlds but lots of gas-giant-only systems.

(4) Move the 100-diameter limit. The real problem is that the piece of space
    you need to control - 100-diameters - is very small compared to Traveller
    accelerations, sensor, and weapon ranges. If ships had to travel
    an AU or two to jump, (a) gas giant refuelling is more attractive, and
    (b) you need many more ships to patrol a system. Aside from rewriting the
    laws of game physics by fiat, there are also canonical systems with
    gas-giant-moon mainworlds or red-dwarf primaries where getting away from
    the GG or RD\'s 100-d limit takes a day or so.

    Big jump limits will also make people tend to use "running jumps" (as
    Marc calls them) which tends to channel all traffic between two systems
    to particular arrival points (you want to be arriving along the line
    (roughly) of the planet\'s orbit so that a arrival time error doesn\'t
    cause your velocity vector to point you away from the planet.)

    I think if I were refereeing a campaign I would just arbitrarily move
    the 100-d limit out to an AU or so.

They\'ve just left the Pysadian surface--27 minutes to orbit.  They\'re
supposed to be leaving the planet--their welcome worn out, and the
starport is tracking them as far as it can (the planet is TL 4, so no
satellites, but the class C starport is TL 8, with trackers and scanners
for traffic control).

The problem is one of their crew mates is in a Pysadian jail (maybe you
read the short story I posted to the TML about him).  They want to swing
back to the other side of the planet, land, and rescue their bud.

This would be no problem on the lowly TL 4 planet--the plan was just to
run out to jump point, like they were leaving, then when they were
suitable sure they were safe from the starport\'s sensors, swing around
the other side of the planet, land, and do their dirty deed.

On the way out to orbit, during that 27 minute trip, we broke in your
new sensor rules--and they picked up a ship in orbit!

Normally, this would be no big deal--just another merchant vessel biding
its time as the crew does the starport thing on the planet, but the
Pysadian officials were hiring local merchant/mercenary bands to help
the March Harrier\'s crew decide it was time to leave.

So, now they are suspicious of this unstreamlined merchant trader in
standard orbit around Pysadi.

Next Sunday, we\'ll pick up with them just about to reach orbit.  I know
they are going to try to give this vessel the slip--so if it goes over
Pysadi\'s horizon, I need to know how long they are going to have the
planet between them and this ship.

Hmmm.  Good thoughts.  As you can tell, I\'ve been getting most of my
technical information out of the SOM.

One of the things I don\'t like about the various design systems for T4
(and most other editions of Traveller, for that matter) is there is not
enough explanation for us laymen out here.

I can understand the stuff, but I have to be able to read up on it to
understand it.  Take the SSDS system, for example.  I just used this to
re-engineer the March Harrier\'s launch.  I noticed a table in there for
"G-tanks".

The text doesn\'t mention G-tanks, and I\'m guessing that these are those
things I saw in Event Horizon.

One of the reasons I rely on the SOM a lot is because it explains
things.  It was in this book that I read what an EMS sensor is.  If you
don\'t know what an EMS sensor, or a neutrino sensor, or a densitometer
is, then when you go to install them using FF&S, QSDS, or SSDS, you
really don\'t know what you are installing.  The SOM is plain on what
these things are.

Since this is the most detailed description of Traveller tech that I
have, I tend to use it quite a bit as gospel.  Now, I\'m running into
problems because T4 designers keep changing what the SOM finally laid
out as "the way it works".

I really wish that, when these design systems are created, the designers
would spend some time explaining what these things are.

There is not one good source in all of the T4 stuff out that tells you
what an EMS sensor is...what a G-tank is...how the jump drive
works...etc.

I\'d like some definition some where if we are going to keep changing
things from what the SOM states.

The vote is not so much to institute policy, as to satisfy my curiosity.  I 
was curious to see the percentage of GMs that would still be using pirates, 
and piracy; the arguements on both sides were pretty exhaustive.  There 
were more than enough reason for a GM to go either way, and frankly, I was 
surprised at the number of people who were arguing on my side of the fence 
after the impressive arguments that Hans offered.  The only reason I am 
posting updates is because I have been requested to.

	Your Trav cargo prices look very high to me.  It\'s not difficult 
to design a ship that can carry cargo for less than the canonical 
1000Cr/Td.  In fact, I designed an integrated shipping system that can do 
it for almost 350Cr/Td, which isn\'t far from your approximated RW 
figure.
	Hans has some good figures for passenger travel and I believe has 
some for cargo as well.  He even adds additional expenses to starship 
operation and still comes up with rather reasonable freight rates.

=== Voter #2 (Idiot/Savant) ===

My comments on the current THUDDD entrants. Feel free to flame if you
think you\'ve been unfairly criticised.

SERAPHIM INDUSTRIES WRAITH:
        A self-described spacebound SSBN, but without the endurance 
to match. Still, it has good sensors and protection, adequete armament 
and acceleration, and best of all it\'s designed from scratch to operate 
with a pair of sensor drones. Despite the price and inadequete fuel 
supply, I like it.
 
BALBOA
        This design is cheap, but possibly at the cost of 
performance. Still, it has adequete sensors, enough fuel and ammo to 
keep it fighting for months on end, and more armour than god. On the 
negative side, the Balboa is unstreamlined, making it dependent upon 
preplaced fuel supplies and ruling out hiding in gas giants; its slow, 
and possibly undergunned. OTOH, you could buy 5 of these for the price 
of some of the bigger designs...

GENERICA SHIPYARDS TYPE 88621-A
        Cheap for its size, adequete armament and protection and the 
best sensor suite money can buy. On the negative side, the small fuel 
capacity (18 G-hours) makes it a short-endurance craft, and the 6G 
acceleration will squish the crew if they\'re ever used. The design 
could be improved by reducing acceleration to 4G or so and dropping 
the extra MFD, thus trimming at least 100 MCR of the cost and giving 
it more endurance.

NVNA UNICORN
        This is my design, so expect to see some bias here :). My 
design philosophy was basicly "small and cheap", based around the 
smallest ISDP TL-10 fusion plant. The result has adequete sensors, 
endurance, and acceleration, but is slightly underarmoured and 
undergunned. Sure, its not as sexy as those big throbbing 900-DspT 6G 
PA-gun and more-missiles-than-god killer penis-substitutes of death, 
but your accountant will love you for it :)
                                         
 [Oh c\'mon, somebody say "mediocre". Please?]
 
ASHKHA STAR COMMAND KUKRI
        Cheap for its size, adequete sensors and acceleration, good 
armament (four power-hog laser bays and _eight_ missile barbettes!), 
and they remembered to add some ship\'s troops (which is where my 
Unicorn falls down). On the negative side, the Kukri\'s endurance is a 
little below par, and being a QSDS design it\'s underarmoured. 
I\'d add an extra pair of sandcasters. 

KOR-EL SHIPYARDS KE-SD/10B PREDATOR
        Basicly a flying missile bay, with attached point defences. 
Good armament and protection, adequete acceleration, but not quite 
enough fuel, and totally inadequete sensors. Still, it _is_ cheap, 
and with a decent sensor-net in place it would be an unholy terror of 
the spacelanes.

VULKAN WERFT EMAN
        Small, and expensive for its size. Still, it\'s fast, well 
armoured, and has good sensors - the armament looks good, though I\'m 
not sure whether the damage for those lasers has been computed at the 
same range as the stuff in QSDS or SSDS. But best of all, Vulkan 
Werft remembered the G-tanks!

ROSENCRANTZ & GUILDENSTERN SCENIC VIEW
        The aforementioned big throbbing 900 DspT PA-Gun and 
more-missiles-than-god SL Needle penis substitute, guaranteed to 
impress the pants off any military appropriations committee. Excellent 
armament, protection, sensors and acceleration plus adequete endurance 
make this probably the most capable SDB in the THUDDD. The problem? 
Price. You could buy five Unicorns or two Kukris for the same amount, 
gaining much more flexability and wider sensor-coverage to boot. 
Still, it does look cool...

PHOENIX P-500SD
        An overpriced one-shot missile carrier with engines. Despite 
its excellent acceleration and sensors, IMHO this design is crippled 
by its low-endurance - a mere ten G-hours and no missile reloads. 
Possibly it could be used as a last-ditch interceptor, but even then 
the price would put me off :(
 
GOODENUF CONSTRUCTION ARGENAUGH
        Another big throbbing 900 DspT PA-Gun and more-missiles-than-god 
SL Needle penis substitute. Technically impressive, but breaks the 
rules by using TL-12 thruster plates - ruling it out of the competition 
IMHO. 

ARCHER
        This design illustrates the absurdity of the rules for 
calculating the damage of batterys - adding the USDs together rather 
than actual damage gives us toys like the main battery on the Archer, 
which magicly turns 5 400 Mj lasers into a single huge 40 Gj laser. 
Anyone else wondering when energy conservation was repealed?
        Rules quibbles aside, I like this design. While it\'s slow, it 
has excellent sensors and protection, a staggeringly powerful main 
armament, long endurance (adequete fuel, but no need for missile 
reloads), and (best of all) a low price-tag. 

HMRSC DARKSTAR
        A slow unstreamlined asteroid monitor with a truely vicious 
bite. Unfortunately it\'s also hideously expensive, costing as much as 
three Archers or six Unicorns, and without the high all-round 
performance of the Scenic View.

=== Voter #4 ===

Balboa class SDB
  Douglas E. Berry, (not supplied)

  Decent ship, but it fails to meet the design criteria in two
areas (IMHO)...first, it\'s unstreamlined, thus it cannot loiter
in Gas Giants (specifically mentioned in the design spec), plus,
it is the "last line" of defence - thus I feel it should have SOME
laser weaponry, in the rare instance that it runs out of missiles
(which is, of course, rare for this design - with it\'s 300 missile
magazine). I like the armor, and the staterooms.

Type 88621-A SDB
  Mark Clark, Generica Shipyards

  Very nice ship, but horrible armor for a SDB. Also, I don\'t care
for bunks being used on a ship that\'s going to be on long missions.
The PA mount seems excessive for an SDB, but certainly provides some
punch. Very impressive maneuver drive - I\'m wondering how you pulled
it off :) However, the crew is gonna be a bit uncomfortable, since
G-comp can\'t handle 6Gs...did you give them tanks?

Unicorn class SDB
  Idiot/Savant, New Victoria Naval Architects

  I like this one a lot, but I cringe at the armor...
Still, it is wonderfully priced, with a good weapon load.

Kukri class SDB
  Chris Cox, Ashkha Star Command

  Excellent ship, probably my favorite.  My only complaints are
the relativly low armor and the tight crew quarters - but neither
of these detract too much from the otherwise impressive ship. The
lack of armor is especially bad since the ship is not particularly
stealthy.

KE-SD/10b "Predator" System Defense Craft
  Bill Prankard, Kor-El Shipyards

  IMHO, this is a poor design. Bad armor, no stealth, horrible
sensors, and no real offensive ability, since you\'re going to
run out of missiles real quick, and the lasers have no punch.

Eman SDB
  Michael Koehne, Vulkan Werft

  An average ship - good armor. But the sensors will prevent an
active lock - not good in combat.

"Scenic View" class Close Defense Vessel
  Martin F C Pickett, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Naval Architects

  Very good ship, but expensive!  Also, no PD weaponry except
for the PA. But nice armament, and good armor and sensors.

P-500SD SDB
  Andrew Moffatt-Vallance, Phoenix Corp.

  A good design, but I can\'t give a higher score because this
ship is next to useless when it runs out of missiles.

Argenaugh class SDB
  Peter H. Brenton, Goodenuf Construction Company

  This ship has a problem - Thrusters are not available at TL10.
If thrusters were allowed, this is a good ship...but that\'s because
it needs no reaction mass.  I also don\'t like the lack of CG...this
ship is supposed to loiter in Gas Giants...CG is a neccessity.

Archer SDB
  Lewis Roberts, (not supplied)

  This is a good design...but I don\'t like the fact it doesn\'t
have any jammers, or EMM masking. Plus, it has no missile
weaponry (although its laser weapons are impressive). Finally,
its maneuver performance is a bit low, but that\'s understandable with
HEPLAR.

Darkstar class SDB
  John Macpherson, His Majesty\'s Royal Shipwrights College

  I like this ship - but the design specs said the ship was to
guard gas giants, and this ship cannot effectively (since it
cannot enter them). The use of an asteroid hull is good one, however,
for an in-system monitor ( which this ship would be good at ). The
maneuver drive is a bit low, and I like to see some missile weapons.
Also, no EMM masking.

You are right.  I was working from memory and remembered type "E"
for type "X".  However, the fact that one will bother to make
a port that is just leveled bead rock would still seem to
indicated the fact the there is some issue regarding "wild"
landings.

The Droyne aesthetic sensability prefers curves & is opposed to straight
lines.  Because of this Grandfather seeded almost the atmospere of
almost every planet in known space with nanites that attack the hulls of
nonstreamlined ships and cause them to crash.  (Since Earth was not
seeded with these nanites we Solomani do not yet know about the
problem.)  Because of this the Imperium & the other races dare not use
them.  They do not even know how silly it is to prohibit unstreamlined
ships from landing (slowly) on planets with an atmosphere. :)

Would there be assigned paths from some office all the way in fram
jump at all system?  I have my doubts.  Such _will_ exist at the
biggest, crowded systems, but it has already been assumed that this
isn\'t where piracy would occur.   Beside, as someone else pointed out,
you just leave at about the same time and get a path this is similar
anyway.

I would say he does, indeed, just attack near the 100 diam limit.  I
can\'t see why he would attack anyplace else.

[Regarding coming out of jump and attacking...]

Well, that\'s not hard, but you don\'t need to do it that way.  You
can approach the same point from the planet all fueled up.

I\'m not sure you space them.  You wouldn\'t kill gratuitously because
you want to encourage the idea that it\'s generally a good idea to
surrender.

>Attacking on the way out is a lot more difficult, especially since the

Yeah, but you will be leaving anyway...

Why?  What mass and intertia problems?  The gravity is on, you
free and ready the cargo, and cut power to the gravity....

Or the pirate ships just keep shooting bits of the merchant until
the crew gives up.  Fighting to the death is a military approach

Well, the pirate is going to be jumping out next, not fighting

way rather than some rare chance of some system failure.

I suppose if the words mean just smooth, then an unstreamlined ship can land
(using lifters) on a world with atmosphere.

On the other hand, if unstreamlined means you can\'t (using just lifters)
landing on a world with atmosphere, then there must be a reason. I can think
of...

The equipment and sensors placed on the outside of the hull is not hardened
to resist the drag of atmosphere, including wind speed not from vehicle
velocity but from weather.

Similarly, the hull exterior is not made to withstand not only atmosphere,
but the effects of exotic or corrosive atmosphere, and perhaps the effects of
water and extremes of temperature.

Can you think of any others?

My takes (for what they\'re worth) on the SDBs, in general.

For the most part, pretty much what I expected. I was surprised about one
thing - the lack of heavy armor on a lot of the designs. Its all opinion,
of course, but I think a SDB needs a good armor belt.

As far as the winning design - well, I hope you don\'t think I\'m whining
\'cause I lost, becuase that\'s not true. I do think it was the best _SHIP_
in the lot. But, it can\'t enter Gas Giants, which I feel SDBs need to do.
But, obviously, the voting public didn\'t agree :)

Once again, congradulations to the winners (excellent designs, all of
them), and I look forward to facing you again :)

The office of Duke Norris announced today that it is imposing quotas and
tariffs on Zhodani fruits and vegetables. This move is in response to
the move last week by the Zhodani Consulate, in which they instituted a
ban on the import of Atrake, a fruity wine made in the Imperium.

The Imperial restrictions is expected to translate into higher consumer
prices for the produce, higher prices at restaurants for dishes
containing those items and scarcity of supply.

The Consulate was not available for comment.

TAS News Service Report

Release Date:	034-1107
System:		Glisten
Subsector:	Glisten/Spinward Marches

By Chi Barr, TNS reporter

This humble reporter discovered that the Glisten system is playing host
to a major figure in the Sword Worlds military forces: none other than
Juri Njvrdinskiold. For those of you who may not know, Mr. Njvrdinskiold
is a retired Admiral of the Gram navy. 

You have may caught a glimpse of him during the recent hijacking of a
bus by escaped prisoners. In that incident, he played a key role in
protecting innocent civilians from harm as well as in capturing the
heavily armed, extremely dangerous convicts.

During a more peaceful moment, he graciously consented to an interview
with this lowly servant of the public. He was quite candid and
forthcoming in his concerns, which I now present to you.

Admiral Njvrdinskiold is aware of the current reorganization of the
Sword Worlds military forces and is concerned about their unification
under a single command. The last time that happened, this reporter
knows, was during the Fourth Frontier War. He admits being concerned
that "extremists" (his word) may have risen to power. However, when
asked to comment on rumors of the Sword Worlds plans with regards to
the Imperium (and, specifically, whether they plan to attack us), he
said only "no comment".

After doing some careful research, this report has learned that Admiral
Njvrdinskiold was the loser in a political power struggle some years
back. The result of the power fight was that Njvrdinskiold lost his
position (read: was forced to retire) and was virtually exiled from the
Worlds. Which is our good fortune, since without that struggle he would
never have appeared in the Imperium and would never have been around to
interview.

Mr. Njvrdinskiold seemed very concerned with the Sword Worlds military
buildup. While obviously not privy to their plans, he can likely read
between the lines. Although he diplomatically elected not to discuss
options available to the Imperium, this reporter got the impression that
a strong Imperial response was in order.

TAS News Service Report

Release Date:	266-1106
System:		Jewell
Subsector:	Jewell/Spinward Marches

The length of the list of Zhodani violations of Imperial citizens
rights gets longer and longer. In the latest maneuver by the
mind-readers, the luxury liner Rising Star was fired upon, boarded and
its passengers and crew interrogated like common criminals.

This reporter was one of the first on the scene when the Star landed at
Jewell Downport early this morning. Interviewing the dazed passengers
and fatigued crew, the following story came to light.

The Rising Star apparently misjumped into Zhodani space. Some of the
crew say that the jump drives were sabotaged, a claim substantiated by
some of the passengers. Bilstein Yards, manufacturer of the drives, is
inspecting them with Downport authorities as this story is being
written. While misjumps occasionally occur, what happened next is
anything but usual.

The Rising Star had apparently arrived in the middle of a Zhodani naval
training exercise, one of many that have been held near Imperial borders
over the last year or so. With sensors jammed, the crew were unable to
determine their exact location and, therefore, were unable to plot a
course home. Several Zhodani fighters apparently ordered the Star to
prepare for boarding.

Despite the protests from the crew, squads of turbaned Marines entered
the Star, rounded up the passengers and herded them off, against their
will, into Zho ships. The cowardly pirates then subjected the frightened
innocents to hours of interrogation. Several were accused of being
Imperial spies and were threatened with painful deaths and torture!

Eventually, the brave crew and passengers were released. Their innocence
was probably determined by the devious mind-reading the Zhos are
well-known for, in violation of the privacy rights of Imperial citizens.
The Star was allowed to jump back into the safety and security of
Imperial space.

The local population on Jewell is outraged at the way the Zhodani
stormtroopers treated the innocent men, women and children of the Star.
Calls for retaliatory measures are being heard throughout this system.
As word of this dastardly deed gets out, this reported is convinced that
Duke Norris will do the right thing and send a clear message to the
Zhodani Consulate about respect for the basic rights of the Imperium
citizenry.

A gathering of Outworld Coalition supporters turned violent today as
clashes erupted with both police and oppositionists.

When the Hope For Peace organization sponsored a protest in front of the
Imperial Palace, approximately 150 people showed up, sources say. The
demonstration was peaceful, allowing the group to express their
opposition to the rising tension between the Imperium and the Zhodani
Consulate.

"We just want both sides to come together to find a peaceful solution to
the problems. Were dont want another frontier war. Why wont they
listen to each other?", said one member of the protest, who asked not to
be identified.

A crowd of onlookers became first unruly, then violent, when someone
reported that a member of the Consulate itself was part of the Hope For
Peace protest. Fights broke out and police were forced to make several
arrests. Several people were taken to hospital.

A police spokesman stated that the Hope For Peace group seemed quite
capable in combat situations, which she described as ironic, given their
mission.  

Duke Norris was not in Mora at the time.

	What about using Pythagoras\' Theorem, which as we all know states that the
sum of the square of the two sides that are at right angles to each other
are equal to the square of the hypotenuse (third side)?

	I should guess almost all here know it, but I\'ll detail it just for the
sake of anyone who isn\'t sure how it would relate to Traveller star maps.
Apologies in advance if this is too much, too little, irellevant, wrong, or
has nothing to do with William the Conqueror at all.

	The hex numbering is similar to x (horizontal) and y (vertical).

	2317 could be converted to y1=23, x1=17 and...
	2212 could be converted to y2=22, x2=12

	The absolute of y1-y2 (23-22) =1, while the absolute of x1-x2 (17-12)=5.

	1 squared equals 1, and 5 squared equals 25. The sum of these is 26.

	Then the square root of 26 equals 5.099, or 5 rounded to the nearest
integer. So the distance of five could be ascertained this way. That\'s how
I\'d it anyway.

	Then...

	The simplest way of doing it on a spreadsheet would be to enter the two
co-ordinates into two separate cells each, so that you have...

	23    17
	22    12

	The equivalent cell references would be...

	A1   B1
	A2   B2

	Formula would be...

	INT(SQRT((ABS(A1-A2)^2+ABS(B1-B2)^2))+0.5)

	The ABS of A1-A2 and B1-B2 would just simply make any result positive. So
17-12 would be 5, and so would 12-17. 23-22=1, naturally.

	The ^2 simply squares the result of each pair, or also multiplying the
answers by themselves. So, 1^2=1, and 5^2=25.

	Then 1 and 25 are added for 26.

	SQRT gives us the square root of the answer, so the square root of 26 is
5.099. +.5 enables the result to be rounded up or down when executed by the
INT instruction.

	That\'s all the formula you need to determine the distance between two
hexes. But anything longer than a few parsecs isn\'t likely to take a direct
route anyway, unless you\'re deep in a Main. You\'ll usually cover more hexes
going from A to B than the direct route anyway, as the crow flies as it
were, or as the Grandfather flies in this case? ;-)

	See ya...

Hmmm.  Your information differs from mine.

Reasonable enough.  IIRC, neutrino sensors are not sensitive enough to
matter w.r.t. piracy.  They are short ranged, and do not give great IDs, if
I remember FF&S2 correctly.  I was arguing from the basis of the total
sensor data that traffic control could reasonably expect to get on vessels
within 100 diameters of the world they were on, which would include IR,
neutrino, etc.

Apologies if that was not clear.

I would be rather surprised at that.  Individual variation counts for a
lot, and even if you can alter some of the signature using the extra
radiators masking gives you, there are going to be parts of a signature
that are hard to alter.  The best you can do is try to make other parts of
the signature dominant, and hope they do not spend serious time checking.

I know a few myself, and this is where I got the information.  Of course,
it is possible that they were pulling my leg, but there were enough data
points that I found it reasonable to believe them.

As one put it, the easiest way to hide a signature is to make the props
extremely noisy, such that the signal normally used to ID a vessel is lost
in the noise.  This will result in a new signature, and the operator may or
may not decide to filter out the noise.  If they do, underneath it is much
of the same signature.

Why do they not do it with commercial ships?  On a commercial ship, the ID
does not matter enough.  They have to get very close, and it is only the
"important" ships they care about.  Since the sonar ID radius for a modern
ship is fairly small, and the ocean is very large, why spend the time to ID
everyone within that radius - it is not like they are going to do anything
interesting there anyway.

In the Imperium, where ships are never more than a few hours out of the
ports, it is worth seeing who is dropping in.  Every traffic control
station can be expected to have an SDB in orbit, and a reasonable sized
sensor dish to feed it information, assuming the world has a pop 5 or so.
Further, the larger worlds can afford to export SDBs to the surrounding
worlds, if it gives them benefits, for a fairly small price if free, and a
fairly small profit if for pay.

Discussions with the aforementioned ex sub chaps.  They held that it is
very easy to make a ship very loud, and very different, but if you filter
out the bent prop, you will hear many of the same characteristic noises
underneath it.

Grant me my positive ID for purposes of this half of the debate.  I suspect
we are going to have to agree to disagree on whether this can be done.

Assume that every time you drove into a gas station, they got a copy of the
vin, the engine serial numbers, the driver\'s license number, the serial
number on the catalytic converter, and so on.  Further, assume that if you
change the numbers, some of them are going to not match.  This is the
situation with the small number of Traveller ships out there.

Clearly, the gas station may decide not to look up every VIN, and every
engine serial number, and so on, in the appropriate databases.  On the
other hand, given the relatively small amount of data, and the fact that
they will have the sensors and the time to gather it, they will likely
record it, if only to track down people who commit crimes on their territory.

After you commit the crime, there will be record of every gas station you
drove past to commit it, so you had best have used a fake ID/signature for
long enough to confuse the back trail, or you had best have done the mods
nearby.  That is, you have to decide before the fact whether you are using
your real ID, or your fake.

Indeed.
