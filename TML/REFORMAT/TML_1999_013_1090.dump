jump is travel outside this universe. The hex system showes a relationship 
between star systems other than strict positional relationship as viewed in 
this universe. Stars, being the great power sources they are have effects in 
dimensions other then our own. The jump "distance" one must cover to move 
between them is dependent upon a different set of physical laws. Just 
because two stars are between 2.7 ly and 3.7 ly apart here does not mean 
that their sphere of influence in jump space is the same "distance" apart.

The hex mapping system is kind of like those city maps where specific 
buildings are shown in an exaggerated porportion and most buildings are not 
shown at all. You can still get where you want using the map. Since you are 
not going to travel through normal space to get to another system why do you 
need a map that would show you how?

For the sake of all of us running campaigns predating milieu 1100, please
don\'t do this. My campaign includes ships far in excess of 1M dtons and I
don\'t need any rules lawyers telling me I\'m running my campaign "wrong".
Yes, it\'s "M"TU, but so far I have not done anything which outright
contradicts G:T.

Does that mean that a PC that retains at least BD-1 has to fork out cash (I
can\'t see free testing, someone has to pay for the equipment, time, and
expendables?) to remain certified?  If not using it means not "retaining"
the skills that weren\'t rolled, then retaining said skills require frequent

First, we need to ask how real are "the values of honor, loyalty, and
obedience" to the nobility.  Obviously it will vary from TU to TU, and from
noble to noble.  Personally, I tend to regard the nobility as something
akin to a bunch of soap opera millionaires - like on Dallas, or all those
other shows I\'ve never watched - sleazy, unprincipled and decadent
intriguers.

Either way, the Imperial armed forces will identify strongly with the
Imperial nobility for the very simple reason that that\'s who they work for.
 The Imperial armed forces do not belong to the \'citizens\'  of the Imperium
for the simple reason that the Imperium has no citizens (apart from the
nobility), only subjects.

This is YTU, of course.

Actually, I\'ve been thinking about the Civil War period too.  (I haven\'t
quite got any documents in a fit state yet, but I\'m thinking about posting
some to the list.)

I see the Imperial Navy/Marines as having been the only true all-Imperial
institutions at the beginning of the Civil War.  The idea is that
hault-Planckwell\'s coup was a coup by the Navy, in order to reverse the
centrifugal drift within the Imperium that had led to near-disaster in the
Frontier War.  The Navy had to do it, because the civil authorities - the
nobility - were (supposedly) too caught up in looking after their own
interests and fiefs to be able to effectively rule the whole Imperium.

This essentially means that for the duration of the Civil War, the old
Imperial constitution was suspended, being replaced by martial law.  When
normality was restored afterwards, the new \'constitution\' was significantly
more centralised, involving such things as cutting back the authority of
the Archdukes. 

So in military terms, at the beginning of the way the nobility was
\'interfering\' in the management of the Navy/Marines, during the war the
Admirals were \'interfering\' in civil administration, and afterwards, each
section of the Imperial system was doing what it was supposed to be doing. 
(Long live Arbellatra!)

Of course all of this is IMTU, and worse, it\'s only one specific view of
the history IMTU.  Whole libraries have been filled with other
interpretations...  :)

I\'m writing this while watching TV, so it isn\'t particularly clearly
expressed.  Sorry.

Oh, for crying out loud.  Did you read what he wrote?  The bit about "there
is
theoretically no reason one couldn\'t build larger ships if desired" would
seem to cover both of these situations perfectly.  This is less restrictive
than the language in High Guard, which sort of implies you can\'t build
anything larger than 1,000,00dtons.

Once you get into variant campaigns, it\'s really silly to demand that
nothing in GT contradict your setting.  If your players aren\'t adult enough
to accept such a minor divergence from the text, then you have some real
problems.  One thing that GURPS is very big on: all rules are optional.
(That\'s why it has so many.)

Yep, local oxygen fractions of 26-28% (vs. basal 21%) are all that are
required to start a forest fire, even in *wet* vegetation. I don\'t think
fluorine synthesis by biological systems is possible or plausible for
the reason you mentioned - it\'s too damned expensive!

Doh! I was trying to make some sense out of the entry in BtC. We need to
find a gas with a high critical pressure/temperature that will lead to
the required greenhouse effect to reconcile the high average surface
temperature and the requirement for oceans of hydrogen fluoride. Or we
scrap one of the latter parameters.

So can I, and this is possibly where the Vili actually live. As I have
said above, I\'m trying to make sense of this world from the G:T version
of the Spinward Marches.

Yes, the most likely metabolic pathway for energy production would
involve sulphur -> hydrogen sulphide. \'Photosynthesis\' would be the
reverse of this. Earthly thiobacteria use this trick to survive in deep
in hot springs, for example. 

Thanks Leonard for your other comments and suggestions and the repost of

O.K.
If you are referring to creatures that breathe through a \'windpipe\',
inflating lungs which serve the purpose of gas exchange with the
bloodstream, some numbers to think about are :-

i. Metabolic rate - remember that this obeys Klieber\'s law and varies
directly with oxygen consumption.

**metabolic rate in kJ/hour = 17.42 X (mass in kg)^0.75 for mammals**

Each litre of oxygen consumed (at standard laboratory conditions,
25 degrees Celsius and one atmosphere (101kPa, 14.5 psi, 760 Torr)
pressure) liberates 4.82kcal or 20.15kJ].

ii. Dead space - that region of the respiratory system that doesn\'t
participate in gas exchange with the blood (and gas flow - harder to
breathe through a long skinny tube than a short fat one). Normal
physiological dead space in man is about 2mL/kg, with a tidal volume of
7-10mL/kg.

iii. The amount of energy it takes to breathe (in man, about 5% of
resting metabolism is work of breathing) which is a function of lung and
chest wall compliance. Lung and chest wall compliance is about 200mL per
cm water distending pressure in man (overall 100mL per cm H2O for the
system, compliances adding in parallel).
	Peak inspiratory pressure is 30-35 cm water.
 	[E.g. consider that whales must rely significantly on the weight of
their bodies being neutralised by water - beached whales die usually of
respiratory failure ; or the cases of people with end-stage emphysema or
in hypermetabolic states e.g. sepsis often require more oxygen to work
their respiratory muscles than they can actually inhale, etc.]

iv. The amount of energy it takes to circulate blood, which is a
function of its viscosity, vascular compliance, etc. The heart consumes
27mL of oxygen (volume at 298K, 1 atm pressure) per minute in an adult
human at rest (whole body consumption is 250 mL O2/min) to perform this
task.

Since metabolic rate is very well matched with organ perfusion and
ventilatory mechanics, the answer must lie in the materials our creature
is made of.

The largest dinosaurs probably represent the upper bound on size for
terrestrial life. Bone is only so strong - it\'s only calcium salts after
all!

It\'s worth noting that, while we\'ve never been in the conquering mode, we
have done a decent job at force projection. One beach at Normandy, troops
committed to every UN peacekeeping operation, Vietnam, Desert Storm,
Rwanda, Somalia, Yugoslavia.... all with a population less than 10% of the
USA (and a smaller economy).

Nothing cruel about it. The pipers didn\'t pursue.

The way I see it, the Armies of the various subsectors answer to the local
Duke.  since the Army\'s main job is to defend that subsector in concert
witht he Armies of the adjacent subsectors, this makes sense.

The Marines answer to the Emperor.  While a Regiment is tied to a numbered
Fleet, they can range wide and far when called for.  Each Marine takes a
personal oath to the sitting Emperor.  If the Emperor dies, the Marines
retake their oath to the new guy.

This is how I see the Civil War also, and I\'ve always loved the image of
Grand Admiral Plankwell marching into the decadent court of Jacqueline;
denouncing her as a traitor to the citizens of the Imperium, and shooting
her as perfumed courtiers run screaming.

I\'m not a materials engineer, but it seems to me that modern materials would
make this less of a problem. Wouldn\'t thinks like graphite and plastics be
much stronger and lighter than anything available in the 1920\'s or 1930\'s? I
expect that GTL-10 materials would be able to solve these structural

Saddam made that mistake with Bush. When Clinton sent the Navy and Air Force
to remind him that it was unsafe to directly attempt to kill a former U.S.
President he seemed to get the message, as former President Bush has not
been targeted since.

This pre-supposes a contemporary western ideological slant on the part of
both TNS and the Imperial citizenry.  During many periods of history
elimination of enemy populations and leaders was an accepted practice.  It
is only recently, with the isolation from violence permitted by modern
western life, that such practices are seen as morally repugnant.

As a further example take Vietnam. (Not trying to start a flame war here.
The follow stance is for illustration only and does not necessarily reflect
deep seated personal beliefs.)  The American public was aghast at the
violence going on in Vietnam against the Vietnam people, which is one reason
that the government lost the support for the war. The last holdouts in the
anti-war sentiment were the middle aged men who, as young men, had fought in
W.W.II.  They weren\'t shocked by the violence. their thoughts, more often
than not, was disbelief that their fellow Americans were shocked by the
violence. "What did they think war was?" they were probably asking
themselves.

Another example. After the Indian Mutiny (1857–58, revolt that began with
Indian soldiers in the Bengal army of the British East India Company.) the
British Army tied rebels that surrendered to the front of cannon and
executed them. No one in Britain or the British press made that big a deal
out of it. Now it\'s a big thing. (I\'m not picking on the British Empire. The
U.S. is guilty of similar atrocities against the Native American peoples.)
The point is, if the government and its people think that such actions are
okay them there will be not public outcry.

If Imperial citizens, as a whole, expect war to be a messy violent business,
which it is, then calls of excessive violence will be met by "So? What did
they expect the Imperial Marines were going to do?" rather than "We\'re
simply **shocked** that an Imperial Marine would do such a thing!"

Its important to remember that there are different types of nobles.
We have High, Honor and Rank nobles.  (I\'m using Milieu 0 as a reference.)

Honor Nobles are rewarded for heroism, innovation, commercial success, etc.
with a noble title.  The possible ranks for Honor Nobles is Knight, Baron and
Marquis.  Baron and Marquis titles may be given with or without heriditary.
(IMO, heriditary would be the rare exception, and these would be the vast
majority of nobles encountered.).

There are two types of Rank Nobles.  One is the local noble in a system which
isn\'t worthy of the concern of a High Noble.  Usually heriditary with a seat in

the Moot, but no real authority out of their local sphere, one or two systems.
The other type of Rank Noble is often a civilian system administrator for
worlds
without Imperial representation.  This type is never heriditary and has no Moot

privileges.

Finally, there is the High Noble.  The smallest portion comprised of the old
families.  New high nobles are rare in the extreme and require the Moot\'s
confirmation.  These are always heriditary and come with Fiefs.  These
are the nobles of the nobles.

IMTU, the Imperial armed forces have two arms: the Navy and the Marines.
The Navy fly the ships; the Marines are the troops who are sent out.
"Army" is used only to refer to planetary ground forces that belong to
a specific planet\'s own armed forces, rather than to the Imperium.

(In fact, this was my understanding about how the Imperial armed forces
were organized for quite a long time. (I started playing Traveller in
1981.))

This means that when the Imperium sends troops, it\'s the Marines they
send. (What I\'ve done, essentially, is to combine the Marines and Army
into a single unit and call them "Marines"...)

I am glad to see the Journal once again able to reach this area;
perhaps it is indicative of a possible settling down of the
political situation in the Core.

I question, though, whether Admiral Alkhalikoi\'s proclamation of
a Regency is really in the best interests of Imperial stability.
Under her plan, the Regency would be maintained until an heir of
the Zhunastu or Lentuli lines could be found, and then that heir
would take the Throne - but what is the real likelihood of such
being found?  No, I suspect that this is merely a manoeuvre to
seize the Imperial power and exercise it, without even a veneer
of legality to grant the authority to exercise it. And who is to
decide whether a supposed heir is in fact legitimate? Not merely
a coup d\'etat, as we have frequently seen over the last years, in
other words, but a naked power grab and the imposition of an
outright military dictatorship. 

The Moot has already offered their support for Admiral Alkhalikoi
taking the Throne as Empress, acknowledging that her trump, the
Frontier Fleet, de facto beats their authority to make the
decision under the Warrant. As Empress or as Regent, she _will_
have the support of the Moot in her efforts, whatever the reason;
the Moot are not stupid.  As Empress, she could wield the
Imperial Power without restriction, and still adopt a
hypothetical Lentuli or Zhunastu heir, designate such heir to
succeed her, and then abdicate, accomplishing her aims. Yet she
instead chooses this route that has only a weak basis in
historical - pre-Imperial, in fact - precedent, and none in law.
Why is this? I cannot answer this question, or propose any
reasonable hypothesis; the political situation is still too
unclear for me to do a cogent analysis. I eagerly await
additional information, and comment from the other readers of
this Journal.

A simple "... and his(her) Heirs and successors according to Law." would
probably be enough, and make life easier.  Though, of course, you can get
into problems in a civil war / no clear legitimate emporer situation.
Though who would the marines pick in suck a situation anyway if the had to
swear a personal fealty to a named emporer each time one was *replaced*

Correct with regard to the flare itself - they only toasted one side of
Darrain. However, it\'s the EMP effect that devastated Darrian\'s colonies
for a distance of 3 to 5 hexes in every direction. Even though they had a
"shut-down" day while the wavefront passed each colony system, not
everything survived.

These days, all Darrain equipment is shielded to prevent such a thing
happening again, so the Darrains are probably not so worried. ;-)

However, the idea of a total war against Darrian if they ever USED the Star
Trigger is reasonable. The Trigger should be viewed the same way that nukes
are viewed today - something you Do Not use. If you are directly invaded,
however, things may change - would the US start using neotron bombs if the
mainland was invaded? That was NATO\'s basis of operations against the
Soviets for many years.

I read it. The part that does not cover the situation perfectly is "1
million dtons is the largest starship that has been built to date". This is
not a statement of the rules used to construct ships, it is a statement of
the Traveller timeline.

>This is less restrictive

>anything larger than 1,000,00dtons.

Not true. High Guard doesn\'t give rules for building things larger than 1M
dtons, but using FF&S or something that does have such rules does not
invalidate High Guard. Saying nothing larger than 1M dtons *has ever
existed* does, however, invalidate any such constructions by any other
rules.

>Once you get into variant campaigns, it\'s really silly to demand that
>nothing in GT contradict your setting.

I never made any such demand. The original poster was proposing wording for
a future supplement. I assumed he was soliciting feedback and not demanding
all referees follow the proposal.

I have grown tired of the claim that every Traveller campaign is its own
setting and therefore no one needs to make any effort to keep it
consistent. The reasons why I disagree are too long to go into here,
however even if it was true it does not imply it\'s "silly" to point out
where a *proposal* for a *future* supplement will have bad consequences. I
attempt to follow the published timeline as much as makes sense. And this
proposal does not make sense.

First, megastructures are a popular theme in science fiction and it\'s
unreasonable to constrain referees by declaring all such starships to be
"variant settings", especially when there is nothing in the previously
published material which requires it to be.

Second, megastructures far in excess of 1M dtons, like Gateway Station, the
Tireen rosette, and Trevannic Alpha have already been published in
Traveller. There is nothing in the rules which make these designs
impossible for starships. On the contrary, it implies that they *are*
possible.

Third, I am extremely dubious of rulings which state that although
something is technically feasible, none of the trillions of sophonts has
ever done it in the millenia of Traveller history. In my opinion this is
contrived beyond credibility.

Forth, such a ruling is totally unnecessary. Simply leaving it out does not
change any existing rules or history, does not affect anyone\'s campaign,
and does not require rationalizations why something that is feasible has
never been done.

TL15 (GTL12).

Step 1: Initial bombardment by the Navy.

Logistics : None. (All Navy)

Step 2: Establish Beach-head

The Initial deployment of drop troops and outriders (jump pack), stiking
down vital enemy instalations and establishing a landing zone.

Logistics :

Power (The power would all be internal , but the consumption of power will
be a telling factor, especially if you need those FMPG againt those
rascally enemy. Lets say 80hours [as per GURPS]).

Food (Again, food/water would be internal or carried by troops. At most we
would be talking a week, but a better figure would be 1 day).

Transport (mainly at this stage for dust offs, as most navy/marine
transport is dedicated with the beachhead establshment)

Step 3: Consolidate

The beach head is now established , and protected by a perimiter of
marines. Outriders and assult gruops ranging out from the perimiter.

Logistics:

Power (Those batteries or power packs need refuleing at this time).

Food (So do those troops)

Transport (Again, dispersed troops need to have their food and power. Those
Close to the beachhead can walk for their fiddles).

***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************
**

So, in the first three stages, we see that the third step require transport
to supply forward elements, but all elements need logistical support. Since
Loren has said that all Marines have BD and FMPG\'s, and cannon states that
the marines do not have instringic vehicals, how can we do this?

NAVY.

The Imperial Navy would have the infrastructure to do all this. They would
proberby have a Battle Dress Tender pinnace or ship\'s boat, with extra
armour and possably support weapons (missiles, heavy fusion beams and nukes
bigger than tactical size). They would allow support of forward troops
(along with fighter support), be able to recharge power cells and provide
field rations for extended piriods on the field.

These Tenders would also allow the rotation of troops back to non combat
areas, and allow better reallocation of troops in areas that need to be
reinforced etc. The Tender  can still kick ass if needed. Treat the Tender
as a cross from AMTRACKS, Battallion HQ and Evac transport.

The tender would be a reserve force, controlled either by the Senior Naval
officer, or Senior Marine Officer, depending on the situation.

On the beachhead, Navy units would establish an interface area, (like in
WWII, where the Navy controlled up to the waterline. In Traveller, this
would be the landing zone). The HQ would be a simple field HQ, with the
theatre Command and Control onboard a starship. There would be no need for
a Field Hospital, as the wounded would be transported back to the fleet
hospital ship. All that would be needed would be a marine First Aid post. A
small logistical base would be set up, possably with a field kitchen, but
more than likely a freezer/heater unit that stores food prepared on a ship
(they use this now in hospitals, in TL15/GT12 this should be a no brainer.
These would be under the auspice of the Navy, as they would be the one
ensuring all the required materials would be there for the marines.

So the huge logistical base that a modern army has today, would be assumed
by the Imperial Navy, allowing a higher percentage of marines to do what
they do best....making the enemy respect their authority!

In the case of the hex map the "points" are the hexes. Gaps wouldn\'t
*have* a co-ordinate. Overlaps would have two equally valid co-ordinates.

True. But as I noted before as far as co-ordinates go (and functions
for turning them into distances between "points"), a hex pattern and a
"staggered square" pattern are identical. Really!

For those of you who never ran into any old wargames using staggered
square maps, here\'s an example:

This is equivalent to a hex map that has the "rows" running horizontal.

Likewise, the cannonball packing, turns out to work out the same as the
hexagonal prisms used in some 3-d game maps.

Hexes get used on game maps because they give a closer approach to
"real" distances than any other "convenient" method.

You\'ve never worked with large databases, have you? That sort of
"non-unique key" is a problem *because* it *will* tend to get data that
should be together filed under different keys. 

You see, you use the "index" (the co-ordinate) as the key to *find*
info. And to link info. Thus, if as occasionally happens, a house on a
corner gets an address on *both* streets real estate and tax records
get horribly mangled. For example, you could run a title check on "1234
S 5th Street" and find no liens against the propert and no easements. 

But after you buy it, you discover that there are several liens on the
"523 W Adams Avenue" which is the address of the side of the house on
the *other* street. And a bi utility easement right through the middle
of where you\'d planned to put the swimming pool. Oops.

*That* is the problem with multiple "addresses" that refer to the same
place. Things *won\'t* be filed under both. Just one or the other. Which
leads to nasty surprises.

A friend had the *original* model (something or other "Lief Ericson")
back in the mid 60s. I picked up the glow in the dark version in the
70s. I seriously doubt that production of the "UFO something or other"
*or* the "Lief Ericson" were less than multiple *thousands*. You

Nope. A parsec is *defined* as the distance at which a 2AU baseline
produces a parallax of 1 second of arc. The 2 AU baseline being the
width of Earth\'s orbit. 

That makes a parsec roughly arctan(.5") AU. 

From part 4 of the sci.space FAQ:

	1.496e11 m	 (15e10) -- Mean Earth-Sun distance (Astronomical Unit)
	9.46053e15 m	  (1e16) -- light year
	206264.806 AU	  (2e5)  -- one parsec
	3.2616 light years (3)	 -- one parsec
	3.0856e16 m	 (3e16)  -- one parsec

So as you can see, the distance is actually *more* than 200,000 AU!

Actually I think it was Larry Niven himself in a publication who made
the claim there were 200 ever made.  Perhaps he was referring to the
originals?

No Doug had mentioned for retired marines a 1/2 point skill with BD,
this is a reduction from the active duty marine of a required 1 point BD
skill.  Also some people require continuing use and instruction to
retain skills and others do not.
I assumed that in previous versions of Traveller, that for PC\'s, once a
skill was learned that they did not loose the skill through lack of
use.  This makes the required BD skill in GT contrary to previous
versions.  I was trying to justify a required skill in GT that was not
required in previous versions.  Again my knowledge of GT is limited and
I do not understand such things work in this system.

Not at all. What it does do is give players a sense of the scale of the
Traveller universe.

The truth of the matter is if you\'ve got rules lawyers who would see such a
comment and gripe about really large ships in your campaign... well, you\'ve
got some really big problems.

That\'s not what he was saying. In fact, what you\'re saying is that statement
is not applicable to *your* Traveller universe specifically and for some
reason you are incapable of communicating to your players that such a
comment has no bearing on *your* campaign.

I have grown tired of when ever anybody proposes an idea to the list for
helpful feedback people are so quick to try and influence the author with
ideas from their own Traveller universe, allowing their TU to become
"official" by proxy.

That\'s something I just don\'t get.

Are your players really that mean to you that simply stating, "Well, that\'s
the official GURPS Traveller universe, and while it is true for the general
\'look and feel\' of that universe, I feel that having really, really big
ships is interesting for *my* Traveller universe," won\'t get them off of
your back?

suppose for the star system generation discussion.

Sun-like stars have superflares powerful enough to fry
 planets
2.08 p.m. ET (1909 GMT) January 7, 1999

 By Paul Recer, Associated Press


 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Superflares powerful enough to fry nearby planets
 regularly erupt from distant stars that are just like the sun, but such
death-dealing explosions are unlikely to occur in the solar system, astronomers
say.

 Two Yale University researchers said Wednesday they have found nine
 solar-type stars that have erupted in flares up to 10 million times more
powerful than anything ever recorded from the sun. They have preliminary
evidence for at
 least seven others, they said.

 If the sun were to have such an eruption, said Bradley E. Schaefer, it could
 possibly cause mass extinctions, plunge the Earth into brief heat wave,
flood the planet with gamma and X-rays, melt electronics in orbiting
satellites,
cause global auroras and wipe out for up to two years all of the ozone that
protects the
Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

 "The loss of ozone could kill the food chain and probably cause mass
 extinctions,\'\' Schaefer said.

 Even smaller bursts, he said, could burn out all of the electricity
distribution systems on Earth, plunging the planet into a global power outage.

 But the Yale professor said there is no evidence that such powerful
"superflares\'\' have ever erupted from the sun.

 "It\'s not going to happen here,\'\' Schaefer said repeatedly in a
presentation at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

 Schaefer said that an examination of astronomy archives uncovered proof that
 superflares erupt about once a century from G type, main sequence stars, the
 stellar type that is just like the Earth\'s own sun. The erupting stars are
up to 100 light years away and pose no threat to the Earth.

 "We found that superflares do occur on disturbingly normal solar-type
stars,\'\' said Schaefer.

 He said the superflares last for one hour to one week and cause the stars to
 brighten by up to 1,000 times their normal luminosity.

 Schaefer said he believes the sun will never erupt with such powerful flares
 because there is no evidence that it has ever happened during the 4 billion
year history of the sun.

 The sun has been scientifically studied for more than 150 years and the most
 powerful solar flares detected have been only a fraction of energy in
superflares, he said.

 Additionally, astronomy records going back for 2,000 years have never recorded

 a superflare from the sun, said Schaefer. And, furthermore, such a superflare
 would have melted the ice on the moons of Jupiter and left smooth frozen
plains. Recent spacecraft pictures of the moons show no such evidence, he said.

 Eric P. Rubenstein, another Yale astronomer, said the eruptions probably occur

 because the distant stars have Jupiter-sized planets in a very close orbit.

 Giant planets in orbit close to a star, he said, would cause a twisting and
 stretching of the magnetic fields that radiate out from stars and from most
planets. The twisted magnetic field lines eventually would explode with a
sudden release
 of energy.

 He said his proposed superflare process is rather like what happens when
rubber
 bands are twisted and twisted until they finally break and snap. The result
is a sudden release of energy.

 Rubenstein said that if his theory is correct, it would explain why the sun
has
 never had a superflare. Jupiter and Saturn do have strong magnetic fields,
but the giant gaseous planets are both too far out to interact powerfully with
the
magnetic field of the sun, he said.

Wear value works fine in MANY cases, as does the related maintenance hours
requirement being reduced (much like the old Type S had with it\'s air
system).

Another case might be "Hot M-Drives", using the MT T-plates, assuming you
are using the rules from DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual... Under said
rules, for short periods, a ship can generate up to 400% thrust! At least
for short periods. On a large craft, shave some 1% off the size of the
drive (1% of drive size, not 12% of ship vol), increase the maintenance
hours, and save massive ammounts of tonnage on large ships.

Jump drives, of course, might have increased misjump chances and/or severity.

Under MT, make mishaps 1d more on the mishap table, or maybe +1 or +2 on
the mishap table. This works for anything which requires a skill roll.

Require a roll to avoid long term effects on anything with hazardous
exhausts, radiation leaks, or similar problems.

Not ENTIRELY true...  I mistakenly crossposted to the TML something aimed
for X-boat, and got highly flamed... This was about 4 years ago... Because
XBoat was aimed at CT/MT, many of the TNE\'ers strongly encouraged CT/MT
material be restricted there. As much by off-list flame-mail as on-list.

I miss the much more "on-topic" nature of the X-boat list. It took nearly 6
months after the reunion for the TNE prejudice to work itself out.... since
there was a hot "rules-fix" debate for MT going on at the time (which I was
participating in)...

Pretty much the same with me, playing since 84. COACC cleared up much of
this for me... according to which, the 3I reserves the right to call up
units from worlds, put them under a joint command, and use them as ground
troops to back up the marines. The Imperial Army, according to COACC,
exists only as Subsector and higher commands, at least as a single force;
below that, it is the local world or group\'s army, which just might be
called up in whole or part into imperial duty.

have a look at:

http://www.btinternet.com/~salvo/traveller/deckplans/background.html

The noted deficiencies of the Pioneer Ecks are at the bottom and take
more space than the features!

My players are probably happy to know that they are flying a one-off
prototype and extensive changes will be made in the final version.

If they get back, they might even have useful feedback for the improved
design.

I did actually fix one of the design bugs by adding extra lift shafts
to the deck plans - the original design only had one lift (on a 5kt ship).

An inventive player discovered the "...structural integrity of the ship is
marginal compared to its performance" feature.

One day they might regret the "...required performance could only be met
by eliminating most of the component armour" feature, but they\'ve already
suffered from the misjump at J-3 feature, and the fact that the only
way to turn off the main laser is to disconnect it from the power grid
and overhaul it.

One feature not mentioned is that when they left, the hangar bay had
neither a heavy fighter, nor a cargo shuttle. Instead, there was
just a bunch of luxury grav cars.

The deck and a half of swimming pool is just the noble\'s accomodation,
its inclusion wasn\'t even a design flaw (IMO).

Did someone mention Paranoia R&D?

Well, if it was the same size as the Earth, I\'d guess at 1G on the
surface. Otherwise, less.

The average density of a starship is lower than that of the Earth
(it\'s all them gaps for people to walk through).

force = GmM/r^2

      = Gm((4/3)*pi*r^3*density)/r^2

thus force is proportional to r (since the other terms are constant
for a given design).

So no ship smaller than Earth can have a gravity (surface or internal)
that would affect a fighter with a 6G drive.

So the reasoning is bunk in most TUs. Except your old GM\'s TU (of course).

You will, but not *that* soon. 

A=GM/R^2
    6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2 (7e-11) -- Newton\'s Gravitational Constant "G"

Let\'s set A = to 1 g (10 m/s^2). And M equal to one teraton (1e12 tons,
1e15 kg).

10=6.673e-11*1e15/R^2
10*R^2=6.673e-11 * 1e15
r^2=6.673e-11 * 1e15 * 10
r^2 = 6.673e5
r=~817

So *if* your teraton ship has a radius of only 817 meters, then it\'ll
have a surface gravity of 1 g. I don\'t think you need to worry about
*that*. 

The *real* killer on large ships is that a ship that is twice as big
masses *8* times as much, but only has *4 times as much cross-sectional
area on the load bearing members. This is assuming you just multiplied
all the dimensions by a factor of 2. 

So, obviously, you need to make the load bearing members thicker. but
as you do that, *their* mass increases. Thus requiring that they be
even thicker *yet*.

Eventually you hit the point where the load bearing members aren\'t
strong enough to support their own weight under even minimal
acceleration forces or turning stresses. Which means they can\'t support
the weight of things like decks, equipment, etc. 

So the real limit is somewhat less than that. But there\'s *always* a
limit, and it\'s set by the strength of materials. And there\'s a finite
limit to how strong *any* material can be. It has to do with the
strength of bonds between atoms. As I recall, buckytubes are thought to
be rather close to that limit. And *they* aren\'t *that* much stronger
than current materials. *Maybe* 10-20 times.

The only way past *those* limits is to crank up the bogon generator and
use something like Star Trek\'s "structural integrity fields".

Modern materials *help*. But we are actually getting a lot closer than
most folks realize to the *ultimate* limits on materials strength.
Those limits are set by the max possible strength of bonds between
atoms. The limit is fairly close the the strength of bucky-tubes. And
buckytubes are no more than 10-50 times stronger than carbon fiber,
which we already have. 

Remember, storms generate stresses that can rip *heavier* than air
aircraft apart. A large dirigible is damned *twice* by the square-cube
law. Not only is it having to keep mass down, but it\'s got this *huge*
surface area. The low mass means the load-bearing members *have* to be
relatively weak. The large surface area means more stresses from wind
forces than a smaller vehicle would be subjected to.

*Small* blimps and dirigibles can have limited usefulness. But things
the size of the Hindenburg, or the Akron just plain aren\'t safe in
Terran weather.

It\'s actually realistic. You should *see* some of the dodges required

From what I\'ve read, they\'ve *definitely* established that the
chemosynthetic organisms are all thru the crust, anyplace there\'s a
crack. So the calculations that say they may outmass the rest of the
organisms on earth aren\'t that far-fetched. For them *not* to, you\'d
have to make some unlikely assumptions unless I mis-remember the

Nope. We were talking about "insect-like" organisms, that have
exoskeletons and "breathe" through a nework of tubules with most of the
work of moving the air being done be diffusion, with some assist from
body movements.

I\'m an asthmatic *and* a snorkeler. I\'ve been all too aware of the
effort it took to breathe during a few attacks (it is a *scary*
sensation to have first had to start *conciously* breathing, and then
after a while, feel your chest muscles getting tired!).

And while snorkeling, it is quite amazing the difference in effort
required between holding your body parallel to the water surface and
only slightly under it (so you are fighting 6-8 inches of water
pressure) and letting yourself hang vertically (which has you fighting
close to 3 *feet* of water pressure).

The originals and the re-release used the *same* molds. They just used
the silly glow in the dark plastic instead of the normal opaque white
styrene most models use.

I suspect that Niven may have been referring to some sort of
modification of the kit done in accordance with Pournelle\'s comments in
the article so as to produce a *true* model of the MacArthur. Or maybe
even something like the expoxy based "kits" you see at some cons (you
can buy "kits" of things like the martian "manta" craft from George
Pal\'s "War of the Worlds"). These "kits" *aren\'t* injectionmolded
plastic. The piece are usually cast resin. And because the of the
limited runs and the work in making the molds, they cost like sin.

I seem to recall that it\'s more a matter of "partial pressure" rather
than percentage. So, for example, a world with 6 psi O2 partial
pressure out of, say 60 psi *total*, would only have 10% O2 but be a
*major* fire hazard. It\'d definitely be toxic to humans in short order!

Well, HF or some other fluorine compound may *be* a good greenhouse
gas. I don\'t know. And I\'m not sure that any of my reference books
would say.

I\'ll have to try digging my way through Fogg\'s book on terraforming and

Hey, I figure it\'d be nice to invent a few "new" biomes.

Oh yeah, I advise that folks read David Gerrold\'s "Warr Against the
Chtorr" series. It\'s got the *only* real extended consideration of what
happens when you start mixing organisms for ecologies of *vastly*
different ages. 

In this case, it\'s terran eco-systems against organisms from somewhere
else (we never find out where, at least not so far). The invading
organisms are estimated to have something like a billion year (?)
advantage over us. 

The results are much like seeding crab grass in a normal lawn and *not*
having any selective weedkiller available. Or, in other words, much
like the sort of things that happened in places like Australia when
non-native plants and animals got released. 

In short, the natives are in *big* trouble. 

I expect to see this sort of thing happen on planets that are colonized
and reasonably earthlike. In some cases, things will be an even match.
So some introduced terran species will die out rapidly. And some will
run wild, driving out the native species in the same niche.

On worlds where the match *isn\'t* so even, you\'ll either see the terran
species run wild, essentially destroying the native ecosystems (hope
the colonists have enough variety of species to come up with a viable
ecology). Or the reverse will happen. Terran organisms will be almost
impossible to keep going. Including people. 

There\'s a lovely reason for a red zone. A native ecology that can eat
your typical terran ecology for lunch. All it\'d take is a few careless
explorers accidentally bringing home something like, say, "super kudzu".
Once they manage to get the mess on the "infected" planet(s) under
control, folks will put up a *very* tight quarantine around the place.

Add in some valuable resource. Maybe mineral. Or maybe you can extract
some wonder drug (or a narcotic) from the plant or a related one. So
folks keep trying to break the quarantine, in spite of the very serious
men with "shoot on sight" orders.

Actually, at any given time, there are several eggs in cells packed
with "royal jelly". When they hatch, if there is a queen, they leave
the nest (or get killed). If there isn\'t a queen, they fight and the
strongest one becomes the new queen.

An odd case is the mammal known as the naked mole rat.

They have a "queen" of sorts. She gives off some pheromone that
prevents any other females in the burrow complex from maturing
sexually. If something happens to her, the immature females start to
mature, and the first one to hit sexual maturity becomes the new
"queen". The others git hit be her pheromones and slip back into
immaturity.

Amen! I referee Classic Traveller, T4, and Gurps Traveller depending on which 
group is playing on the weekend. I can use all the information that is posted 
on this mailing list. 

I have been using the mailing list for a short time and have been struck by 
the apparent disproportional use of Classic Traveller over the later 
versions. I have seen reference to other mailing lists, particularly for 
Traveller: New Era. To be honest, I am surprised by the fact that Classic 
Traveller appears to remain the foundation or version of choice by the users 
of this mailing list. I realize the Traveller referees are notorious for 
picking and choosing what rule from each version applies to their campaign. 
Personally I used the character creation and vehicle construction rules from 
MegaTraveller, the world building and ship building rules from Classic 
Traveller. I dabbled in using the T4 rules for combat and character 
generation for a short time when it first came out. 

I am curious -- Is Classic Traveller still the primary version of rules 
enjoyed by referees on this list (even after all these years)?  Due to the 
level of Classic Traveller, especially High Guard, being featured in most 
discussions on this list, I dug out my very complete set of the little black 
books and accompanying supplements and adventures. I luxuriated in the 
reminiscing that we baby-boomers tend to do, remembering my "Golden Era" of 
gaming. From 1977 to 1987 I Classic Traveller was the only game of choice for 
me. During those years I was first a sailor deployed at sea for very long 
periods of time on patrol, then for a very short time a college student, then 
a soldier in the mech infantry in Europe. Classic Traveller was a fantasy 
environment that allowed for the inclusion of elements from the reality that 
my players and I really experienced. For short times our submarine took on 
the reality of being a ship in jump space taking us to our next destination, 
or our experiences in the German countryside became common reference points 
for the war against insurgents on Efate....

Opening that reverantly packed away little black GDW box brought back a lot 
of excellent memories. And I realized the simplicity and technical 
thoroughness of those original rules were in fact quite special. They had 
sustained countless hours of role-playing covering just as countless varied 
encounter situations without failure for a decade before the "improvements" 
came. I am now enjoying my Classic Traveller books one more time. 

But back to the intent of this posting, I am curious to how other members of 
this mailing list rate the various versions of Traveller in usability, and 
relative use versus other versions. AND, if possible please provide 
explanations for your reasoning. 


Thank you,
An Old Traveller.

According to both the Regency Combat Vehicle Guide and Star Mercs, a Marine
squad is normally mounted in an APC, so they do have vehicles to recharge
power supplies.  (they can\'t agree on what that APC is, but that\'s another
question).  

In an planetary assault, I would assume that about a third of the Marines
land by meteoric assault, without their vehicles.  The rest would arrive by
landing craft with their APCs plus attached tanks and meson artillery.  The
second or third wave of landing craft would carry the APCs for the meteoric
assault element, along headquarters company support units (maintenance,
supply, etc.).  This force needs only food and water and possibly some
ammunition depending on what generation of Traveller you\'re using and how
your Marines are equipped.  It should be self-sustaining foe close to a
week, including a couple of days of intense combat.

IMTU, I give the Marines more projectile artillery: Drone missiles at the
platoon level for recon/strike, and MRL launchers in the company for
suppression.  These are probably the main consumers of logistics.  I also
have my Marines using heavy gauss rifles and GLs, with FGMPs only as fire
team support weapons.  This also increase logistics demands, but gives them
a lot more flexibility.  With a gauss rifle you can take out a sniper
without setting the building he\'s in on fire.

I GM exclusively, Classic Traveller.  I do have nearly all of the
Megatraveller stuff as well, but mainly use that to supplement my
games.  Traveller was the first sci-fi in space game I was ever
introduced to and I have far too many \'golden\' memories of the old
gaming sessions we used to have to want to go to something different. 
Its like in Gamma World, the very first RPG I was introduced to, I still
play version 1 whereas there are 5 versions of it.

If I want to design something for Traveller, I use the T4 rules - I like
the clarity and summary formulae given the the people who wrote the errata.

For play, I use the T4.x rules (actually my own variation). this because
T4 sort of has the right feel and with Marc\'s T5 beta rules on disk,
these are the easiest version to hack into my own set.

Plus I like M0 as a setting - I can boldly go where everyone has gone
before - and get there first.

A lot of the GT stuff looks like the sort of things people would
have written for T4 if they had thought someone would (a) pay them
and (b) not add lots of errors. So I\'m buying them for background.

The MT and TNE periods were when material was being published stating
how people thought things worked so I keep source books and Challenge
from that period for technical background.

CT is the Traveller "reality check", since things were so much simpler
back then. A quick swop to CT stats can show if something looks reasonable.

Finally, if trying to make my point on the TML, when physics fails,
then I\'ll misquote from whatever version of Traveller comes to hand.

I find CT misquotes are considered the most authoritative.

In other words, some bean counter tried to save a little computer memory.
Gap-space in a cannon stack would be limited to 4 possible spheres.  So from the
perspective of the person looking it up, it really doesn\'t take too much extra
effort to make sure which object you\'re refering too. Not that many objects appear
in gap space... its almost as if somebody intentionally spaced stars in the center
of hexes :)

From the database programmer\'s point of view, its as simple as creating a lookup
table that points to the appropriate file.  Rare gap-space objects would have
multiple lookups that point to the same file. So, what\'s that? an extra 200 bytes
per gap-space object pointing to a gigabyte information file?

Since objects are rarely named after their arbitrarily designated location, a
lookup will usually use the target\'s name and not the location.  Location searches
would probably involve pointing at some point in space and catching all database
events within one parsec (usually producing many hits) or even larger like a
subsector or sector search.

Partly right, IMHO. The PC would have to fork out cash to remain
_certified_. If they didn\'t, they wouldn\'t necessarily lose the skill, but
they wouldn\'t have the paperwork to prove to a prospective employer that
they were still current.

It\'s like my CPR qualification. I still have the skills (albeit somewhat
rusty) but my qualification expired last year. If you collapse in front of
me I\'ll step in if no one else does, but I couldn\'t get a job that required
CPR certification.

  Oops, I appear to have distracted myself around the first 
line. How about: "Not individual wars, but an attritional 
series (which, given Motie generation times, wouldn\'t be a lot 
of years - depends on how much hardware they have to use, and 
their relative productive efficiencies). IIRC, they seem to be 
quite comfy with the idea of breeding right up to the ragged 
edge of their carryign capacity with Warriors and then count
not only on winning but of losing a bunch of the surplus in the 
war..."

	One recurring theme in the Motie conflicts seems to be the
	limiting resources. I would tend to think that a society\'s
	success would be limited by its resources rather than its
	population (the higher population may even reduce the
	resources available for crucial uses). Nevertheless, it is
	certainly true that an increased population does generally
	give a society an advantage in competition, but keep in
	mind that the Motie breeding system makes it impossible to
	breed "...right up to the ragged edge of their carryign 
	capacity with Warriors..." because that would imply a 
	higher rate of reproduction among warriers than other races.

And then there\'s Crazy Eddie, the guy, who, when just enough materials is

Poor Crazy Eddie.

You are cheating. You are using weight, wingspan, and length. Those are
*not* interchangeable. And, as I said earlier, the limiting factor is
the maximum distance of an internal point from the surface of the body."

	If I may quote you specifically:
	"Even a "typical" tarantula has a body that\'s far bigger than 
	any insect can have."
	In just what sense did you mean "far bigger"? Not knowing, I
	compared a couple of different measures of body size, showing 
	with each that the largest spiders are not "far bigger" than 
	known 	insects, let alone the maximum size that "any insect 
	can have."

"Length is *definitely* not related to that. Neither is length of
weight. *Thickness* is. But only in a minimax sense, That is, the
critical factor is the maximum "minimum distance to the surface"."

	More specifically, it is distance to the site of O2 exchange.
	If we are considering a body that exchanges gases over its
	surface, then its size would be limited by the rate of 
	diffusion, the shape (your "thickness"), and the rate of gas
	use in the body (did I miss anything?). However, if gas is 
	exchanged through only one site (say, the book lungs), then
	the distance from the site of exchange to the most distant
	metabolically active site becomes the limiting factor. If,
	on the gripping hand, the organism has a system of tubes
	running through the body through which air is moved to some
	extent by body movements, then the situation is much more
	complex and a maximum size cannot be simply ascribed.

"Also, there\'s some debate as to what the partial presure of O2 was 
back when that dragonfly was around, If, as some suggest, it was 
higher, then the dragonfly likely couldn\'t survive under current conditions."

	No problem, an alien planet could have lower G, higher O2,
	no vertebrate competition, or any of a number of conditions
	which could favour the evolution of macroinvertebrates.

Exoskeltons, maybe. For tracheal resipiration, I want some hard

*Of course* the males aren\'t needed for parthogensis. That\'s the
*definition*. What I said had *nothing* to do with that. 

Might I trouble you to try a bit harder to write responses that
actually deal with the issues being discussed, rather than with some
*different* issue?

I\'ll guess...trees?

I\'m wondering about the calcium salts in terrestrial bone composition.
Even if the dinosaurs were at the terrestrial limit (1G+calcium-based
bones+cube-square law), what would the limit be like with a different
bone composition? Or is it more a matter of structural design details
than composition?

Most organisms use the safe combinations. They also avoid triple-bonded
carbon atoms (eg things like acetylene, calcium carbide, silver
acetylide, copper acetylide). 

Pentavalent nitrogen tends to turn back to trivalent nitrogen at the
most inconvenient times.

ps. I thought it was the "bees" you didn\'t swat? (obscure "Legacy of
Heorot" reference :-)

Whoops! I missed the above the first time thru.

Bone is actually *stronger* than steel. It\'s a 2-phase compsite of
calcium phosphate(?) and collagen. Sort of like fiberglass or
graphite/epoxy composites. 

One of the *big* hassles with artifical joint replacements is that they
have to be the same size and shape as the original. And surgical steel
just isn\'t up to it. For example, there\'s a "spur" on one of the bones
of the elbow that acts as a "stop" to limit motion. This getting
damaged is what usually happens when a pitcher ruins his arm. The
replacements have this tendency to break or to "smush" if you try
anything like "normal" extremes of activity.

Hip joints are another nightmare.

Yes, Virginia, bone *is* stronger than steel. Find a hunk of steel rod
the size of one of the bones in your forearm. Find another the size of
the other. Grab them by the ends and bend. If you are reasonably
strong, the bars will bend. And the bones in your arms won\'t notice the
stress.

Well, there are the redwoods. And then there are those multi-ton fungi

    'body' => 'The recent threads concerning the Imperial Marines, along with issues
relating to my ref\'s current campaign (which is based on my character\'s
command of an Imperial Army jump troop regiment), have led me to
contemplate crew-served weapons for jump troop and Marine units.  As I
see it, crew-served weapons for a meteoric assault unit (Marine, Army,
or other) would consist of one or more of the following:

1.  Heavy weapons that can be deployed in a single assault capsule. 
Equivalent to air-dropping Ma Deuce (the M2 Heavy Barrel caliber .50
machine gun, for the uninitiated).  This weapon is a bit too large to
fit into a capsule that also contains its gunner.  Its crew (probably a
two-man team [gunner and assistant gunner] links up with the weapon on
the ground, and operates it in support of platoon/company actions.

2.  Heavy weapons whose parts can be carried by its crew.  Equivalent to
air-dropping a light-to-medium mortar (60mm to 81mm) with its crew. 
Each crewbeing carries a piece of the weapon in his/her/its capsule,
along with a few rounds of ammunition (or power supplies).  The crew
links up dirtside, assembles the weapon, and operates it in support of
company actions.

3.  Heavy weapons whose parts can be dropped in multiple assault
capsules.  I can\'t think of any weapons systems that are air-dropped in
this manner (then again, I\'m not combat arms).  Similar in concept to
Case #2 above, except that the crewbeings must track down the parts and
assemble them.  This type of weapon would probably be used at battalion
level, as part of a dedicated weapons company.

4.  Heavy weapons that can be dropped in outsize capsules.  Equivalent
to air-dropping a 105mm howitzer.  This class of weapon differs from
Case #1, in that it requires larger-than-standard drop capsules (or
ablative drop pallets).  It would generally be found in dedicated
batteries or battalions.  Ammunition or power supplies would also be
dropped in outsize capsules or ablative drop pallets.

5.  Light vehicles (unarmed).  Equivalent to air-dropping HMMWVs as
[exapmles are not all-inclusive] prime movers for light artillery, or
with SIGINT/EW modules on the back.  Depending on the size of the
vehicle in question, and the size of outsize capsules developed, these
would be delivered in either outsize capsules or ablative drop pallets. 
Alternatively, they could either ride down in landing craft or
self-deploy using their grav modules, time permitting.

6.  Light vehicles (armed).  Equivalent to air-dropping Avenger or
TOW-armed HMMWVs.  See Case #5 above for delivery.  These light armed
vehicles would most likely be found in dedicated weapons platoons or
companies/batteries.

I would welcome any suggestions concerning the following:

a.  What is the most effective weapon for each case discussed above?

b.  What is the largest feasible drop capsule?

c.  What is the largest feasible ablative drop pallet?

d.  How long should it take to assemble a weapon dropped in separate
pieces (Case #3)?  (Assume four pieces, each massing about 20 kg.  Do
not include the time it takes for the crewbeings to rendezvous with the
component parts.)

Look back at your own quoted response. It dealt with "males aren\'t
needed FOR PARTHOGENSIS" (emphasis added). My comment, quoted above
dealt with parthogensis not being able to produce offspring with
chromosomes the mother didn\'t have! (ie being able to produce males). 
It turned out that reptiles don\'t have the XY/XX differentiation. I was
going from what I knew about mammals where, where parthogenesis can
*only* produce females.

So I was pointing out (incorrectly as it turned out) that parthogensis
*couldn\'t* be what was happening because the offspring were male. Not
that males were needed for parthogensis.

Like I said, different problems. 

So your reply, "correcting" something I had neither said, nor implied
was more than a little annoying.

I say A, your reply tends to be "but B is wrong". See the problem?
Like I said, you are refuting points I never made.

Then give me the respect of actually looking at what I *said* and
replying to *that*, not to some side issue.

Above, we have me stating that "you can\'t get males via parthogenesis"
and you replying "parthogenesis doesn\'t require males". in our other
big "debate" I keep talking about the limits on exoskeletal creatures
that "breathe" via spiracles (or "trachea" as you started calling
them). You keep dragging in stuff like book lungs. Or I talk about
size without actually *specifying* "maximum \'minimum distance to
surface\'" in that post though I\'d been quite specific about it in
previous posts, and you go on about length, mass, and wingspan, none of
which relate to the sort of "size" I\'d already established that we were
talking about.

I\'d *love* to get better data on stuff from someone who knows. I\'m
glad to have found out that the "female offspring only due to lack of Y
chromosome in mother" limit only applies to mammals, for instance.

I\'m not an expert. Just someone who has read widely and is good at
retaining the gist of it, if not always the specific details. "Wide but
shallow" you might say. 

But I\'m getting *really* tired of "corrections" that have little or
nothing to do with what I\'m talking about. 

In short, respect *me* enough to make sure you understand the context
before replying. That includes not forcing me to repeat in great detail
things that were established in previous posts. 

As I said in the beginning on the "size of \'insects\'" bit. My reading
says that there\'s a limit of about an inch for the distance to the
surface for spiracle based respiration. I\'d welcome a better figure, or
even range of figures. 

But why should I have to keep repeating things like "maximum \'minimum
distance to surface\'" when I\'ve already stated (many times) that this
is what I meant by "size". Or go thru the "no, I\'m *not* talking about
book lungs" bit every post when that *too* has been stated several
times. 

I am *not* writing journal articles. I\'m carrying on a *casual*
discourse, and as such I have every right to expect the other
participants to rember what parameters were established in previous
*recent* messages. 

You could be a great resource. But not if I have to spell every single
detail out in every post. Like I said, *you* are responsible for
remembering the context established previously. That means remembering
how things were "defined" only a message or two back, and responding
based on *that*, not on assuming that the words are now being used
differently. 

If you can\'t, I\'m going to have to figure out how to filter out your
posts, simply because there aren\'t enough hours in a day to
re-establish the context with every message. Nor is there any reason to
subject myself to a constant barrage of well-meaning but off-target
"corrections". I don\'t need the annoyance.

It is more design than composition. As in "crystal" composition, size,
shape and orientation are very important. But so is the collagen
("gristle") matrix the crystals reside in. 

Bone is a two-phase composite, just like fiberglass (glass fibers &
plastic resin) or graphite fiber composites (carbon "whiskers" and
plastics or even metals).

One phase provides the strength. That\'s the calcium salts, glass fiber
or carbon fiber. But those are all *brittle*. The other phase
(collagen, plastic, aluminum) provides the "toughness". 

Alas, the only "skeletal" materials terran life has come up with are
calcium salts (shell, bone, etc), "pure" collagen or cellulose
(sponges, trees) or silica. 

The only large organisms using a silica skeleton are "glass sponges".
Almost all the others are tiny diatoms. I\'d guess that this is due to
silicon being so hard to handle biologically.

I seem to recall that on Epona (a world created by/for a writer or

"muscle tissue was based on tissues that *expanded*. And "bones" were
combinations of "extensor" tissue and tension members.

You\'re missing the point. It\'s not the *programmer* who creates the
problem. It\'s the *data entry* people. If an item has two "index
values" (which is a violation of database design right there!) some
clerk is going to file data under index value A and another is going to
file it under index value B. 

The "lookup table" you are talking about *is* the index. And my point
was that the index entries *have* to be unique. Otherwise you get data
that applies to the same place filed in two *different* places.

To put it another way, you\'ve got two different "record numbers", which
means *by definition* that there are two seperate records.

Sorry, but names aren\'t useful as a primary key. If you do a search on
"Portland", you\'ll get at *least* a dozen different records. If you do
a search on "Leonard Erickson" you\'ll get *thousands* of hits. And we
know for a *fact* that world names *are* duplicated in the OTU. Heck, I
think there are even some duplicated *sub-sector* names. 

So what do you do when you get multiple records like this? You tell the
database retrieval software "I want the one at <location>." And if the
co-ordinate system allows for two different but valid sets of
co-ordinates for a world or system, then you\'ll only get the data filed
under the set of co-ordinates you entered. You *won\'t* get the data
filed under the *other* set of co-ordinates.

The "within one parsec" bit *is* the sort of co-ordinate grid we are
talking about. You aren\'t going to run distance calculations on
zillions of records. You are going to point at a "box" (set of
co-ordinates) and retreive all the records associated with that
"address". 

Sometimes you\'ll miss something (like the house you didn\'t know was on
the other side of the street from the zip code boundary). But by having
*unique* addresses (co-ordinates, aka "hex numbers") you get to have a
quick, *simple* index. As soon as you allow gaps (areas with *no*
address) or overlaps (areas with multiple addresses) you\'ve made data
storage and retreival sufficiently complicated that you *will* be told
to scrap your silly system and come up with something *usable*.

The point is that they don\'t necessarily *know* that there\'s more than
one possibility. This sort of thing is *why* the post office gets
involved with assigning house numbers. 

Likewise, with your setup, since objects bing in the "overlaps" would
be rare, people aren\'t going to realize that i\'s possible for there to
be two "addresses" for the same "place".

No. It\'s not. You are confusing saving space with the *requirement*
that index values be unique. Why on earth do you suppose they assign
things like Social Security numbers or driver\'s license numbers? They
do it because they *need* a unique identifier to distinguish records
that may otherwise have non-unique "keys".

A few examples of what happens *without* such keys (from comp.risks):

An agency used name, city and date of birth to generate a "unique" key
for records. Sounds good, right? Until they discovered that there were
*two* John M. Smiths, born on the same day in the same (fairly large)
city. Oops.

The Post office files mail forwarding instructions by a combo of last
name and the address. Sounds good, right? Except that when I moved into
my apartment, things got messed up. You see, the previous tenant had
the same last name.

So, getting back to our "co-ordinate" question. 

Given that new systems have to be added easily, you need something that
*doesn\'t* use arbitrary numbers. Because that would require assigning
them from some central authority, or assigning ships "blocks" of
numbers to use for system IDs. And worse, it *is* possible for the same
system to get "discovered" by two different ships (if it\'s on the
border between their assigned search areas). Which would have it appear
to be *two* different worlds until someone analyzed the data carefully.

So, the best bet is to use location on some sort of grid. You assign
the system to whichever square or hex it is closest to the center of.
This gives each system a unique ID. In the (rare) cases where you wind
up with two stars in the same "box", and they *aren\'t* gravitationally
linked, you either fudge the box boundaries a bit (not recommended) or
you just treat them as a single system anyway, and stick a note about
them *not* being a binary in the system data. 

This gives unique keys, fast, easy filing and instant (rough) location
of an object from it\'s co-ordinates. If you need more exact location
data, that\'ll be in the data records you retrieve *using* the location
key. 

Basicly, if you\'ve got gaps or overlaps in the "boxes" you\'re pretty
unclear on why we even *bother* to have "boxes".

Far Future Enterprises Policy on use of
Traveller Role Playing Titles and Trademarks.

  There some questions about what we can allow and what we can\'t allow in
order to protect our trademarks and copyrights. Here are some answers to
FAQs (June 22, 1998).
  1. May I create my own, original works and put them on a web or ftp site
or share them with my friends?
  Yes, however the Copyright/Trademark holder, Far Future Enterprises
requires the following.
  a) You don\'t charge for it.
  b) You include the following site-wide disclaimer in the text of a story
or article, on a web site, or in the about box and/or splash screen of any
software:

  The Traveller game in all forms is owned by Far Future Enterprises.
Copyright 1977 - 1998 Far Future Enterprises. Traveller is a registered
trademark of Far Future Enterprises. Far Future permits web sites and
fanzines for this game, provided it contains this notice, that Far Future
is notified, and subject to a withdrawal of permission on 90 days notice.
The contents of this site are for personal, non-commercial use only. Any
use of Far Future Enterprises\'s copyrighted material or trademarks anywhere
on this web site and its files should not be viewed as a challenge to those
copyrights or trademarks. In addition, any program/articles/file on this
site cannot be republished or distributed without the consent of the author
who contributed it.

  c) You notify Far Future Enterprises (it is sufficient to e-mail
FarFuture@AOL.com) saying "I have a Traveller Web site at this URL:
http://www.somehere.org/some.html" or other similar message.

  2) May I post the contents of a Challenge Magazine Article online or on a
web site?
  Yes, as long as you have the permission of the original author and our
disclaimer is present. The following message about this from our licensing
department:

  Far Future Enterprises will give permission to post Challenge articles on
Traveller to web sites provided the author of the article has also granted
permission. In observance of the magazine article\'s author\'s rights, we
cannot give permission without the author\'s permission. Regrettably, Far
Future Enterprises is not able to locate authors for you. The site must
carry the proper Far Future Enterprises copyright/trademark acknowledgment.
  If the article was authored by Marc Miller, you have his permission.

  3) May I rewrite the game in my own words, scan parts of the book, or
create any other derivative works.
  No. Our reasoning is this:
  If Far Future Enterprises does not establish standards for fair use, and
does not police any use that is made, then Far Future Enterprises runs the
risk of losing an enforceable ownership right. I can\'t use your car, even
if you aren\'t using it. I need your permission. I can look at it, admire
it, even write about it, but I can\'t take it or re-paint it without
permission. Intellectual property is a special case, but the idea is much
the same.
  You can write about the Traveller universe, and put it on your web
site... but you can\'t reproduce the rules (or re-writes of the rules, etc.)
except for about a page (because we give permission to do that, provided
you post the proper acknowledgment).
  Some publishers just say "You can\'t post anything." We are trying to have
a kinder, gentler approach. "Far Future Enterprises wants to be a player
friendly company. We understand that you love the game and want to see it
foster. We believe in supporting you the best way we can. Right now, we
encourage you to create your own original works and have them follow our
policies, which are the most fair in the industry.
  But you can\'t just go rewrite the books in your own words.

  4) What is considered Fair Use of your material?
  About a page at a time.
  The site must carry the proper Far Future Enterprises copyright/trademark
acknowledgment. For posting of text or material from printed books and
modules, Far Future Enterprises permits inclusion of some material and
mention of trademark names (Traveller, and other titles). Our permission
does not extend to wholesale or complete republication of our texts on-line
(for obvious reasons). Limit your republication of texts to short passages
(essentially a page or less of text). Our policy is to not be burdensome in
our requirements, while still protecting our ownership of the text to these
games. We appreciate game player support of our titles and we work to make
involvement in these games interesting and fun.
  This permission allows you to cite a portion of the book without copying
the entire book. For instance, for an adventure about the Spinward Marches
where you need to repeat a section about Regina, you could cull it from
various texts and reproduce it. You could use a quote or two, or if need be
extend that to about a page. However you cannot say "Here is page one of
the T4 book." "Here is page two of the T4 book.", etc.

  5) May I scan in a piece of artwork or a map for use?
  Some artwork is created by the artist under a "work for hire" contract
where the ownership of said art becomes the property of the publisher. Some
artwork is provided on a limited use contract, in particularly photographs.
If the artist created the works as work for hire for GDW (usually staff
artists at GDW), then Far Future Enterprises holds the rights to say "Yes"
or "No" to the question. If it was done by the artists on their own time,
in particular for photographs, it may have been done on a limited use base,
and that artist may own the copyright. So here is what we can allow:
  Artwork such as items, vehicles, charts, maps and logos were created for
GDW and we have the full rights to them. Atmosphere pieces, other
illustrations and cover art, you need permission from the artists. Far
Future Enterprises regrets that we cannot contact the artist for you. As a
special case, you may reproduce covers credited to Steve Venters.
  Far Future Enterprises will allow you to use those items which we have
the rights to, but in limited terms. You must include a Copyright for each
piece used similar to:

  This map is Copyright © 1977 - 1998, Far Future Enterprises All Rights
Reserved. Licensed for individual use.

  You cannot scan entire sections of art in an attempt to reproduce a book,
but if you want a to display a map on your web page to annotate an
adventure you are righting, or you need to display a tank for an article
that you have composed about it, then its OK to use it. You also must still
have the site-wide copyright/trademark acknowledgment/disclaimer.

  6) What if I have a Special Case?
  Contact Far Future Enterprises (FarFuture@AOL.com) for a specific ruling.

Handwave time, for this and the Maghiz.

Is it possible that the flares originate from the stars poles? (ala Neutron
stars). So that secondary effects at Parsec distances are only in the cone of
dispersal from the stars poles? Immediate effects in the plane of the stars
system are relatively limited?

I have, since 31 December 1998, maintained a Web site dedicated to ship
design under T4/FF&Sv2 rules.  This Web site is on the GeoCities
server.  Given the changes to the GeoCities Terms of Service [ToS] that
went into effect at the end of June 1999, I suspect (in the absence of
legal advice to the contrary) that your intellectual property to the
underlying basis of my ship designs may be in jeopardy, in the event
that I should access my Web site to edit, change, or delete it.  Since
the revised ToS state, in part, that the site user

	 "warrant[s] that the owner of such Content has expressly granted,
Yahoo the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully

incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now

I do not believe that I have your express permission to post material on
my site that is copyrightable by Far Futures Enterprises.

I would appreciate it if you would send me both written and e-mail
correspondence instructing me to remove any material that may include
Far Futures Enterprises material from Yahoo/GeoCities, with a 30-day
notice.  That way, I should be able to remove my Traveller material from
GeoCities, without granting them a share of intellectual ownership of
the removed materials.  By so doing, I will protect both my intellectual
property (the specific designs posted on my site) and yours (the
Traveller background and rules system, as described and extended in
_Fire, Fusion, and Steel_, 2d [T4] edition./

FWIW, I have already made arrangements to move my Traveller-related
material to downport.com.  This move should be completed no later than
07 July 1999.

I have forwarded a copy of this e-mail correspondence to Andrew Akins,
the original author of the Microsoft Excel 5.0 spreadsheet with which I
designed the Traveller starships in question.  I welcome his response as
well.

Which means, in essence, that subsequent Motie societies were able to
_rebuild_, rather than _build_, civilization.  (This was the whole
_point_ of the museums, IIRC.)  The difference is obvious, when one
considers the following:

1.  Motie societies will eventually rebuild.

2.  Rediscovering techniques in a museum will allow those techniques to
spread through society much more rapidly than initial discovery would.

3.  By not having to waste time "re-inventing fire", the Moties would
have more time each cycle to develop new tech.  While not all of their
new tech would survive the end of a given cycle, each cycle would tend
to have higher-tech systems or techniques surviving _somewhere_.  Next
cycle, the Moties already have fire, and don\'t have to waste their time
re-inventing the wheel.  Cycle after that, the lever, the pulley, and
Archimedes\' Screw are all common knowledge....

I don\'t have a copy on-hand, but I suspect that the Twilight: 2000
adventure "Air-Lords of the Ozarks" would give you some background (if
you convert from T:2K [1st ed] to T:2K [ver 2.2], you can get to the
equivalent of TNE, as both are GDW "House Rules" games).

For a quick-and-dirty treatment of zeppelins in air combat (WW I-era),
try GDW\'s "Blue Max."

Firstly, thanks for the reply.

I have not seen Star Mercs. I do agree on your last point here though. I
would point out that at TL15, the line between an APC and Spaceship would
have been very blurry or totaly dismissed as a relic of a pre-grav
technology. Given that a Tank at TL15 can orbit the moon, the main
difference of an APC and say a pinnace is the person defining it.

A marine would proberbly call it an APC, while a naval officer would call
it a pinnace.

And you thought a TML flame war was bad!

IMHO , there would be a god awfull turf war on who supplies the transport,
and since the Navy is the senior service (Al la Royal Navy), they would
proberbly win.

The

Would the marines have heavy artillery? To continue on my origional
thought, Artillery could easily be supplied by Naval assets. Fighters,
OrBatts and even artillery (rocket deployed salvo\'s launched from
space/fighters, that hover out of battle in an artillery pool untill
allocated by ground forces.

Squad based artillery (equivelent to mortars) would be the norm for most
units, maybe a Artillery BD, replacing the FMPG with an indirect projectory
weapon???

It also allows more marines on the firing line.

I think that my point was a bit lost here. I am not disputing what
logistics was needed, but in fact pointing out WHO supplies it. It was
brought about by a post last week about cooking with a BD on, and I thought
"Why do they need to?" and the answer is: No they dont, because these guys
have massive support from the navy.

No matter how rich the Imperium is, and no matter how big the Imperial Navy
budget is, marines would be a scarce comodaty.

1. Each marine on board removes 1 naval crewman from the ship compliment.
2. The marines are dependant on the navy for transport.
3. It is extreamly wastefull to duplicate logistics, naval and marine, as
the navy would be expected to carry it.
4. Fighters can be used in space superiority and ground support. Tanks are
next to useless in space.
5. While their would be dedicated Marine Transport ships (The MEU assets of
the 3I), they woul be crewed by naval forces.

  Or it would imply that the Masters are letting their Warriors breed at

    'body' => 'I\'ve been contemplating the very strong negative reaction to the GURPS
designed GTL12 Marine Commando Battledress (GT:SM p61). It seems obvious to
me that the major problem is that most people believe that it is way too
powerful. A squad of NPC\'s armed with this battledress would be generally
unbeatable by even well armed PC\'s. PC\'s armed in this fashion could conquer
a world. This would result in a generally unbalanced game. From the
statements it sounds like some feel that battledress should be weak enough
to be taken out by small arms.

I have to generally disagree with this. Let me describe how I\'ve used this
kind of ironmongery in the past, and hopefully demonstrate that it has a
place in more than just MTU.

When running an active duty campaign I used rules from AH\'s Starship Trooper
game modified with Traveller stats to get the feel of ground combat that
Battledress of this type would give. Basically my PC\'s were individual
troopers and I ran the opposing forces (who were Zhodani, not bugs).  I
shaved off movement and armor value to account for the lower Zhodani TL and
boosted the stats of the weapon platforms upto tank stats. All this was way
before GURPS, of course, 1980\'s.

This would also work with Mercs. Just adjust the stats to get a lower level
of DR, movement etc., use a hex map with hexes equal to either 1 km per hex
or 1 mile per hex and go for it.

This kind of game lets you really bring out the heavy stuff. Major battle
riders, ortillary, tanks. Run it like a combination boardgame and RPG. You
can even let your PC\'s run squads of NPC\'s. Is it Traveller? Is FFW and HG
Traveller?  After the battle give\'em medals and move on the next adventure.
But now they\'re real veterans. They\'ve faced down a tank, while in a
battlesuit, whose air is leaking; watched the soldiers under their command,
and perhaps another PC, die from enemy fire; and if they won got to do mop
up operations, always a good plot hook if done right.

The other use for this kind of equipment is strait ex deus machina.  How
many have you used the old SDB ploy to bail your PC\'s out of some silly spot
they got themselves into, out of either stupidity, overzealousness or just a
couple of bad roles? You know? You\'ve spent months on this campaign and now,
in just a few minutes, a bad role has the PC\'s whole party breathing vacuum.
Rather than leaving them to the cruel winds of fate, bam! There\'s a local
SDB to chase off the Pirates/Corsairs/Opposing Magacorp ship and pull our
heroes fat out of the fire.  You can use a Marine Commando unit the same
way. Our heroes bite off more than they can chew? Don\'t want to flush months
of gaming down the tubes because one PC decided to charge when he should
have been laying back and listening? Send in the Marines, preserve the PC\'s
and just give up this part of the campaign.

They other use is as a break. If the possibility exist that a force so
powerful could descend on your players if they cowboy too far, then
sometimes they\'ll use their heads instead of their guns and role-play to an
answer, instead of shooting their way to one.

As for the battledress itself. Is the design excessive? Maybe. Is the design
of the F/A-18 excessive? This is the product of one of the richest, most
technologically advanced star spanning empires in existence. If I was the
guy in charge of ordinance I\'d push the designers to give me all they had.
If it could be taken out by small arms fire I\'d have\'em all shot with small
arms fire myself. For those who are worried about the 70 mph ground speed,
just add inline skates ala \'Star Kid\'. (Okay it\'s very comic bookish, but
what the hell, its all for fun anyway.) Balance it out by giving the
opposing side weapons that can take out those babies, if you use them.
Missiles with shaped charges, PAWS and Meson guns that frag a battledressed
Marine stupid enough to play above NOE. (AH:Starship Troopers gave three
vertical movement speeds for troopers: Ground movement, Nape of Earth, and
High Altitude Flight[also known as I\'M A TARGET mode].) Next time I use it I
intend to try Bob Sanders system of modular armor to give my players a
greater variety of weaponry.

The Imperial Marines are not a seperate organization, they are part of the
Imperial Navy, they just have their own command structure (as historical
marines have done), which is subservient to the naval command structure,
usually at the level of the captain of the ship on which they are currently
stationed. Obviously, once detached from a ship on a particular mission they
may no longer be directly under the command of the ship\'s captain, unless
they are marines assigned to his ship and it\'s a small ship with no staff
level marine officer.

Notice also that in the character generation rules marine pilots cannot gain
starship pilot skills, and this along with there being no cannonical
references to marine-controlled ships, implys that the Imperial Marines are
not a seperate organization. (if they were truly seperate they would have
their own transportation, like the Scouts )

The Imperial Army is a cannonical entity ( since Book 4, as no detail is
present in Book 1)  It includes COACC, and the "wet"  Navy, though only
ground forces are covered in Book 4. Note also that there is no coverage of
"ships troops" or security in Book 5, as it is assumed that this is provided
by a ship\'s marine detachment, and there is a specific assignment for
Marines, and a skill table in Book 4 for "ships troops".

I started in 1977, using a hand-written copy of the rules a friend had
"copied" from the only real copy of the books in the country, so don\'t try
to pull the grognard on me.

Just to make it clear though, that post of mine was merely an attempt to
point out, one, that the US is not the only country to have marines, and
that the US Marine Corp as it is now is an aberration compared to how Marine
forces have been organized in other navys or even how the US marines were
organized historically.

I own every version, but play only CT - except in the very very rare
occasions someone else is the ref.

I milk the other versions for background, inspiration, and just plain
entertainment - stuff like Path of Tears is just a good read, even though
TNE\'s rules make my ears bleed.

Why do I prefer CT?  Well, nostalgia is a part of it.  MT was a little too
broken for my tastes when it first came out, and I have never had any great
desire to go though lots and lots of books doing errata.  Similarly T4,
unfortunately.  As I mentioned above, I just plain don\'t like the system
used in TNE - I was never a T2K player, due to anti-nuclear allergies of
the sort that were common in the \'80s.  As for GURPS, well, no-one seems to
play it much here anyway, and I\'m not going to teach it to other people
just so I can play Traveller!

Those are the negatives.  The positive side is that CT is simple.  Partly
that\'s familiarity, of course.  When I\'m playing a game I tend not to like
to be distracted by rules, so I can concentrate on actual plot and
characterisation.  If I want to play a wargame, I will, but when I\'m
role-playing I prefer a looser framework.

My \'dream\' set of basic Traveller rules would be something like three
CT-style little black books, with some of the gear from Mercenary, robot
rules similar to those in the Best of the Journal #1, and a really dumb set
of vehicle combat rules no more complex than Book 1 combat.  It wouldn\'t
have to deal with really fabulous military vehicles - stuff like a fairly
basic G-carrier and a tracked/wheeled APC/LAV would do for most uses.  It
should also be able to deal with fire against grounded civilian ships.

It should also be supported by two more LBBs - one that\'s a big set of
accurately cross-referenced examples of \'how to do things\' - generate a
character, run combats of various types, and so on - that is separate from
the main text of the rules.  The other should concentrate on campaign and
scenario design - something missing from CT, and other early generation
RPGs, but essential in more modern games.

This basic box could then be supplemented by tons of background material,
optional, more complex rules, and so on, with all this stuff being distinct
from the basic rules, rather than bound together like T4.  To run a game,
then, you would need a small pile of little \'pure rules\' books, plus your
campaign notes, and not have to wade through a hundred pages of
irrelevancies and \'art\' every time you want to find anything.

Would such a thing sell?  Probably not.  Then again, the RPG market is
pretty much saturated, so putting out any game at the moment is a problem. 
It might just be easier for me to assemble such a set of rules myself, for
my own games....

Note that the same design firms creating battle dress will be happy to

capable of cracking battle dress. In the original Traveller rules, several
small arms were capable of taking out a BD trooper. Thus BD troopers
in Traveller should act like infantrymen, not like invulnerable supermen.

GURPS is home to many genres that create super killer battlesuits - 
Mecha and Superhero settings especially. These seem to be inspiring 
the GT perspective on Battledress, and the effects are quite different 
than those provided by the original Traveller universe. 

IMO, the striking power of an Imperial Marine unit was based on it\'s
mobility, coordination with Navy assets, advanced weaponry, and
superior training and experience. It wasn\'t based on each individual
Marine being invulnerable, super-strong, and able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound, no matter what all those recruiting videos say... :-)

Speaking for myself -- I am running a campaign using GURPS Traveller. 
I chose this because I myself and most of my gaming group are long-term
GURPS fans, while only myself and one other had any real familiarity 
with Traveller and its universe.

However, I find that I can get useful information from any version of
Traveller (though I am completely and totally unfamiliar with T4...).
So if someone posts something that\'s based on CT rules, if it\'s in any
way interesting and/or useful, I can adapt it to GT without trouble.

The two things I have to keep reminding myself are that GURPS tech
levels are not quite the same as Traveller (any version) tech levels,
and that a displacement ton in Traveller (volume of 1 ton of liquid
hydrogen) is not the same as a standard GURPS Space displacement ton
(volume of one ton of liquid water). 

In any case, I welcome the posts from all the different versions and
editions of Traveller: CT, MT, TNE, GT, T4, whatever -- it increases
the odds of my finding something with which I can say "hey, yeah, I can
try this in *my* campaign!"  :)

The major difference betwen these two options would  be that the second is
more survivable in a hot DZ, the troops can just run and assemble later,
whereas the first option , if the weapon is not aotonmous, means you lose
the weapon.

Another possibility is weapon designed specifically as a droppable heavy
weapon

In this case, once airspeed drops below a predetermind values, the weapon
automatically deploys and begins seeking targets.

It could even use grav, balloons, or parachutes to "loiter" providing aerial
support, spotting, or FO/designation operation to ortillery units.

If you\'ve got battle-dress and grav belts, vehicles are a waste of time.

If you\'ve got grav tech armoured or unarmoured G-Carriers will be used for
all the above purposesm, and will land themselves from orbit with ablative
or other sheilds in the first  wave and be deployed from assault carriers in
the second wave if everything goes according to plan.

If you _haven\'t_ got  grav, well then you\'d better hope the defender hasn\'t
or you\'re probably dead.

In this case the most likely  transport will be heavily-modified V-TOL or
rotary aircraft ( such as the thing in Aliens ), or standard helicopter gun
ships and air/close-orbit superiority fighters , launched from a landed
assault carrier or from orbit.

Wheeled and tracked vehicles might be used also, but probably only after the
beachhead was established.

Again, no point in having light vehicles if you have battle dress.

And again the G-carrier or grav tank or specialized version of these ( such
as grav self-propelled meson or fusion artillery) will do this job.

> I would welcome any suggestions concerning the following:

If you\'ve got the tech and the money,  fusion artillery is the best for all
cases except indirect fire support, in which case meson artillery is best.

At lower tech the question is highly dependant on what tech you do have and
in what areas.

Missiles only make sense for anti-tank use, but if you control the skies
(which you really _have_ to do for a succesful assault ) then kinetic
ortillery is probably better at taking out tanks than any missile you can
carry on the ground, so direct fire and explosive devices,  ( artillery,
rockets,  VRF gauss guns etc become useful )

 > b.  What is the largest feasible drop capsule?

IMO. about the size of a G-Carrier for both . Anything bigger it\'s probably
better to use a Gcarrier or
a ship.

About 30 seconds, if anything.

At TL12+ I\'d expect the weapon to be autonoumous enough to deploy and
assemble itself on landing and prevent itself from being captured by enemy
troops.

That was the MacArthur from The Mote in God\'s Eye?  Wow.  I built the

It surely _would_ suck, should a crewbeing purchase agricultural lands
("buy a farm") during the drop, with said crucial part remaining outside
the perimeter.  However, as those who have watched the "Space: Above and
Beyaond" episode "Sugar Dirt" could point out, ground-based fire-support
assets are a _good_ thing.  If the desired heavy weapon won\'t fit in one
capsule, then one must either drop the weapon in pieces, or drop it
unattended.  Either way, one must drop extra ammunition/power supplies,
or the weapon in question falls silent.

Meanwhile, see Case #1 (heavy weapon that can be dropped in a single
assault capsule).  I used a cal .50 as an example, but that doesn\'t mean
that other crew-served weapons can\'t be dropped in a single assault
capsule.  Case #2 was meant to describe weapons (in general) that
_won\'t_ fit in a single can, and must therefore be dropped either in
pieces [case #2] or in outsize capsules (case #4).

The Wiesel is a fine airborne [lightly] armored support vehicle
(although, I must admit, I\'m quite partial to the M551-seires
Sheridan).  In fact, in a 1990s socio-politico-economic simulation, I
specified the Wiesel as a support vehicle for my airborne forces. 
However, when converting to Traveller, one must ask not only what are
the capabilities of the light vehicles in question, but also how will
the fire support vehicles get into position to support me?  Can my fire
support vehicle hit dirt via meteroric assault, or must I wait until the
landing craft touch down to get my mobile heavy weapon support?

I can live with that, as the limit for a heavy-drop capsule.  Based on a
10x capsule, and assuming that said capsule has a more-or-less
cylindrical shape, I can devise the largest possible weapon that can fit
in such a canister.  Does anyone else have other ideas on this subject?

Also, what might be the limit for vehicle ablative drop pallets, in both
volume and mass?  _Could_ one drop a Sheridan-equivalent from orbit?

Type I collagen which is also found in tendons and skin is, weight for

I apologise for the imprecision. One atmosphere ambient pressure was
assumed and this should have been stipulated. 

With regard to oxygen toxicity :-
i. Normobaric (1 ATA pressure)
* In individuals with emphysematous lung disease, inspired oxygen
concentrations of more than 35% will lead to hypercarbic respiratory
failure from ventilation - perfusion mismatch within 2-6 hours.
* At one atmosphere absolute pressure, 100% oxygen will cause chest pain
and decreased lung volume within eight hours in previously healthy
volunteers.
Marked diminution (15-20%) in vital capacity (lung volume) is evident
within 24 hours from absorption atelectasis (all oxygen removed from
alveoli, which therefore collapse).
* Within 48 hours, histological if not frank clinical evidence of
pulmonary oedema (lung flooding with inflammatory fluid) is present.
* Premature infants are at especial risk of also developing retrolental
fibroplasia of the lens of the eye from ingrowth of blood vessels, if
exposed to 100% O2 for this length of time.

ii. Hyperbaric
* High partial pressures of oxygen leads to central nervous system
stimulation -> fitting. Warning symptoms may include nausea, ringing in
the ears and facial twitching.
* The likelihood of fitting is a function of partial pressure and
duration of exposure. Increased uptake (e.g. exercise) is another
important consideration.
* At a partial pressure of oxygen of 4 atmospheres, fitting will occur
within 30 minutes. Hyperbaric chambers typically run with oxygen partial
pressures in the neighbourhood of 3 atmospheres, which suggests a very
steep dose response curve.
(Leonard, your example above is equivalent to a partial pressure of
oxygen of ~6/15 atm - I give critically ill patients more than this
routinely without any untoward effect).

With regard to an alternative greenhouse gas for the fluorine planet,
how about sulphur hexafluoride?

With regard to competing ecologies (or representatives thereof) :-

This idea seems a little fishy to me (in the absence of genetic
engineering) ; I\'ll leave it to \'Peez\' Ferguson
to comment on \'The War Against the Chtorr\'.

Yes, in Book 6, Scouts, there was an atmosphere type labelled as \'thin,
low\'. Sounds like an intriguing place for a biologist to visit...

I concede the flawed reasoning about exoskeletons.

Regarding this suggestion :-
>  How about tissues, the missing link between cells and organs.
Good one!

I would note that nervous tissue requires relatively rapid conduction
velocities for it to be useful at all. Pressure wave conduction is a
viable alternative in creatures from very cold worlds where the overall
tempo of metabolism would be slower.

Muscles and contractile tissue? Pulleys and hydraulics would appear to
be the most promising paradigms.

Structural tissue : must be insoluble in solvent system. Metal
deposition is unlikely because reducing salts takes a lot of energy.

Hmm... to work!

My gaming group are largely the same people I played classic Traveller and
MegaTraveller with from 1982 until 1992 or so. We also started playing
GURPS around 1988, and several of the new players also have a GURPS
background.  

I tried running a CT campaign two years ago, prior to the release of GT. I
ended up scrubbing the campaign for various reasons but was inspired to
start a GT campaign once I learned of the material. This was partially due
to Sufficient Boredom on my part--I had enough free time and money to
justify making a campaign happen. But it\'s also because GURPS and
Traveller have long been my favorite gaming systems (beating out THE
MORROW PROJECT, FGU\'s DAREDEVILS, and RUNEQUEST) and I longed for the
chance to take advantage of the best of both.

I\'m no stranger to having to "homebrew" rules and debug gaming systems, so
where I have found problems with GURPS Traveller I have fixed them
unmercifully: I downsized the StarMercs Marine battledress considerably,
and made other changes to fit my own universe.  My players have always
been of the "let the GM worry about the rules" type, so familiarity with
game mechanics wasn\'t much of an issue.

But I find a great deal of congruence between GT and CT--I never got into
TNE or T4 (got disgusted when they decided to UTTERLY DESTROY the
game-universe I spent a decade collecting bacground information on!) but
GT seemed to be based on the Traveller universe/setting I liked best. I
like being able to use GURPS advantages/disadvantages for Traveller
characters (with the limitation that the characters have some sort of
Traveller-appropriate background) and it\'s nice having characters that
don\'t risk dying during character generation...

I don\'t know.  It\'s a show with so much potential that it SCREAMS, yet it
ends up feeling like AD&D mixed with the second season of Buck Rogers.  It
also has to have been done on a shockingly low budget, the special effects
are what REALLY SUCKS!  I\'m still trying to figure out how they did CGI
that bad!

I\'ve seen all the episodes so far, and will probably see the rest, but I
don\'t think I\'ll miss it.  It\'s really a shame because the concept has so
many possibilities.

BTW, something to remember, they only filmed half of the first season
before TNT canned it.  The only reason they\'re showing it is to recoup some
of thier loses.  Who knows the Sci-Fi channel might pick it up if we\'re
lucky (would that be lucky?), after all they wanted to get B5, but TNT beat
them out.  It looks like it\'s on a low enough budget that it couldn\'t get
much worse if it went to the Sci-Fi channel.

Mileage varies.  The first two eps are the weakest so far, in part because
of TNT meddling (so says JMS, and if the changes he ascribes to TNT are
correct, I\'m inclined to agree.  Things like "we need a fight scene," which
gave us that cheesy brawl in Episode 1 and "we need evidence of Earth in
turmoil" which gave us bad archival riot footage.).  The most recent
episode was pretty impressive, I thought.  No action at all, but lots of
backstory and character development, which is surprising for TV SF.  Now, I
can see how some people would not like it (no action), but I thought it was
a good show.

Agreed. However the key word is "infantry trooper". Except in the insanity
of the last two centuries, Military weapons were not commonly available to
just anybody.  In a sane world Joe blow in the street should not normally
have access to the same weapons available to infantry.

True. However in the AH:Game a type of more heavily armed hovering platform
is available to some opponents. The platform if my memory is correct has a
higher movement factor than the Troopers and more firepower. The specific
game stats were not important as I raised them to simulate tanks anyway.

I suspect that under most combat conditions manpack SAM\'s haven\'t been an

either Kosovo or Iran.

Absolutely. And such weapons are probably available to some Merc companies,
and I\'m sure that the Zhodani have a few designs along those lines too. I
just doubt most PC\'s will find them at Honest Kern\'s surplus weapons.

Strictly for on road transport, of course. Any battlefield transport will be
at Nape of Earth. For planetary combat, outside a metropolitan area, you use
Battledress like a gunship. Any concentration of living things, not
exhibiting IFF you toast. That\'s what the AESA and Radscanner is for. You
paint my buddy with your targeting laser and even if you take him out I
saturate the area with lots or ordinance, either my own or for artillery.
You use an energy weapon of any kind I toast you. You use a communicator. I
toast you. You shoot a missile at me and I drop below the tree tops and use
countermeasures.

That\'s all battledress is advanced weaponry.  It\'s not invulnerable. The
right weapon will take it out. Fixed and vehicle weapons can take out a
Marine in Battledress, as can support weapons, if you hit the guy enough
times. I haven\'t played the Marine Commando armor yet, but when I do you can
bet I\'ll use a battle damage table to reduce the suits effectiveness as a
result of battle damage. I expect the GURPS active duty military book when
it comes out will have an anti-battledress weapon in it (as well as
antiarmor weapons. Even before that I\'ll probably put together something if
I use battledress in my game (As opposed to just running a scenario to see
how it plays.)
And as for leaping tall buildings at a single bound. With contra-grav belts
available at GTL12, any fighting force that doesn\'t equip its troops with
flight capability, is just plain negligent. Might as well not even send they
out with NBC capability. Yeah I know most GM\'s hate contra-grav belts. And
some don\'t allow them at all. (It\'s very hard to strand your players
somewhere if they\'ve got them.) But I think they\'re great plot devices to
get your players to the action, and much easier to control than a player who
has teleportation.

I wouldn\'t "drop" it as such. Use a grav tank, and an ablative shell
(complete with deployable, jettisonable "air brakes"). It makes like a
meteor, though with some interesting "jags" in it\'s course as airbrakes
deploy and burn off.

Once it\'s low enough, kick in the CG at max decel and jettison any
remaining shell.

Assuming decent CG "redline" power availibity, it\'ll get down faster
than coming down on CG all the way. 

And yes, you have the thing *crewed* for this. 

I expect that even drop troops consider the crews of this sort of
support craft to be nuts.

So where\'s the URL?

My biggest beef with them, btw, is their entire \'promo\' was several ads on TNT
starting about a month before the first ep.  Hardly anybody knew it was around
unless you were lucky enough to catch one of the ads.

Its not so much that they are "far-fetched" but that there is so
limited data.  The scientist doing the ground breaking work
have to sample wells and such, nobody is directly sampling
several km into the crust under sterile conditions.  They
have done a reasonable job of established the likelyhood that
chemosynthetic organisms are living on basalt and CO2 in the
deep crust, but they, at least when I\'ve talked to them, feel
more work needs to be done (unfortunately the budgets for this
sort of thing are limited).

As the idea that these organsims outmass the rest of the biosphere,
that is basically back of the evelope calculations based on a few
data points that needs to taken with more than a grain of salt.
I might turn out to right, but I wouldn\'t count on it just yet.

There have also been speculation about the linking, throught a
subsurface layer, of widely disperses hydrothermal systems to
explain the relationship of some organisms.  However, that is
speculation.

Let me be a little more precise: if Battledress becomes the standard
infantry uniform, then the standard infantry weapon will become one
capable of reliably cracking Battledress. Not the heavy weapons, the
special weapons, the orbital or vehicle weapons...the **standard** infantry
weapons.

Once such weapons become the standard, they will become available
to troops not covered in Battledress. Classic Traveller had Gauss Rifles
and HEAT rounds for gunpowder-style rifles (and even pistols), and
others as well. What does GURPS have?

That\'s all battledress is advanced weaponry.  It\'s not invulnerable. The

Try some weapons against a Commando Battlesuit. I only have it
secondhand (not having that particular supplement), but I\'ve been
hearing things about fusion guns not hurting them.

If I need a tank to kill it, and it can kill a tank, it\'s a tank. This is simply
a major change between the GURPS TU and the official TU - Battledress
was good stuff, it wasn\'t a Panther-G on steroids.

The conversion to GURPS seems to have geared up an arms race. 
Battledress becomes mecha, infantry weapons get upgraded to
be able to hurt it, grav tanks get beefed up until they make Bolos look
wimpy - they have to, otherwise no one would buy tanks, they\'d just 
get a fire team of guys in Battledress. No tech level increase required,
just look at the background material with a different rules set. <WEG>

GTL-12 missile will only miss a man in a GTL-12 CG belt if the computer fire 
control has an emotion simulator chip and feels pity for the poor grunt.

Flight capability is nice. Put it in armored G-carriers and scary assault
landers where it belongs. The only guys who get CG belts should be the 
commandos and raider forces who never fight anyone who\'s ready for them.

Yeah I know most GM\'s hate contra-grav belts. And
some don\'t allow them at all. (It\'s very hard to strand your players
somewhere if they\'ve got them.) But I think they\'re great plot devices to

My PC\'s tended to use them as tools, rather than as transportation.
We had a few exceptions, but the common use of a CG belt was to
climb a wall or sneak up on someone. Price was one reason - we
seldom had enough for everyone, IIRC we often had one or two
but no more.

I admit to being happy to control their use. I never killed anyone for
using their CG belt, but we did have some entertainment with winds,
passing delivery "trucks", being mistaken on a low-tech planet for a
hostile UFO...

  The war against Yugoslavia was a meaningful model of the battlefields in

Strange...

Last time I remember us tryin to invade Iran was back a bit before Regan took 
office.  That would put it back, what, 20 years?  \'79ish?

It\'s not exactly correct that, "[e]xcept [for] ... last two centuries,
Military weapons were not commonly available to just anybody."  There
really wasn\'t much distinction between military and non-military weapons
until the rise of mass armies in the 19th century (nor was there much of
a professional infantry until about then).  Before then, civilian
weapons were about as good as military weapons -- sometimes better,
because they were manufactured more slowly, and hence more carefully,
than military weapons, which might be churned out of weapon-smiths\'
shops as fast the smiths could make them.  Mass production with
consistently high product quality didn\'t come about until the 19th
century.  The military\'s advantages in conflicts with civilians were
usually more men, more weapons, more ammunition (if we\'re talking about
weapons that use ammunition), and, of course, military discipline.  The
farther back in time you go, the more this is true. 

Recall that the American revolutionaries whose declaration we here in
the USA celebrated this past weekend were mostly armed with their own
personal weapons at the beginning of the war, but were able eventually
to defeat the British army (with help from Britain\'s enemies, like
France).  Moreover, almost four hundred years prior, the British yeomen
at Agincourt roundly defeated the pride of the French war machine (i.e.,
heavily armored knights) with their own longbows, which they used at
home to bring down game.  So that yeoman infantry owned personal weapons
that proved superior to the regular French cavalry.  

On the other hand, at various times and in various places throughout
history, the ruling class has imposed limitations on private ownership
of weapons.  Okinawa under Japanese domination during feudal times is a
good example (incidentally, Okinawan karate, of which shotokahn is the
modern descendant, was developed for unarmed and unarmored citizens to
defeat armed and armored soldiers in personal combat).  

Moreover, many restrictions on private ownership of military-grade
weapons only arose in the last two centuries, when small arms and light
crew-served weapons became efficient at killing large numbers of
people.  (See The Social History of the Machine Gun, a great book that I
read about 20 years ago; I\'ve forgotten the author.)

Personally, I run a modified Mega Traveller, but have most of the US
versions of CT (missing a few adventures, and many issues of JTAS< but do
have best of JTAS vols 1-4).

My (somewhat sarcastic) opinions of the editions
<sarcasm=biting>
CT: The vision.
MT: The rules of choice
MT-HT: The beginning of the fall... Personally, I felt that the resolution
should have been a reformed and reunited 3I.... not the setup for virus. I
liked HT just fine on it\'s own merits until Survival Margin Came out.
TNE: The setting destroyed, the rules confounded, and PC\'s made into
Ubersophonten. Something about a vargr in combat armor surviving 7+ hits at
point blank from a FGMP-14.
T4: The vison returns, but the rules go screwy.
T4.1: The vision fades, the rules get patched.
GT: Less Canon, More inconsistancy. Playtesting is a forgotten art.
Continuity with 20 years of canon thrown out for ease of authors.
</sarcasm>

Seriously, tho, I have run all editions except GT... but the radical
changes from canon (ok, really, they are multiple, subtle, and insidious)
make my actually running GT as written less and less likely as more comes
out.

TNE I found too damned safe for PC\'s... you just can\'t kill them without
overkill. Plus, I hated the RCES and the changes in the Regency.
Additionally, I felt that most of the 3I should have resolved into a
restored 3I... not been wiped out by virus.

T4: to quote Marc Miller "Yes, it is TNE without virus"..... It lacked the
grand and wonderous tapestry of the late 3I...

Besides, my players have threatened to lynch me if I ever suggest TNE or T4
again.... currently, we\'re taking a break from SciFi. But I have constant
requests for MT, which I prefer anyway.

The beginning, actually.  <grin>

> MT: The rules of choice

Hmmmmmmmm...  Sometimes I wonder bout that.  I never did get all the MT I 
could get my hands on, and I\'m woefully deficient in eratta for it.

I *liked* HT.  I could see the point of massive destruction happening 
throughout the confines of the old Imperium; after all, several factions are 
fighting a war to the last drop.  But a restored 3I?  Not a chance.  
Personally, I\'m of the same frame of mind as the guy they quoted in SM I 
think about if the Rebellion ended one day and everything went back to 
\'normal\', it would invalidate everything that had happened.  IMTU, the 
Rebellion *happenned*.  AAMOF, it\'s *still* happening (ca. 1124).  But even 
without Virus, the factions should *not* have recombined.  Instead, I would 
postulate several sector-sized or less pocket \'empires\' based loosely on the 
\'Safes\', with the \'Wilds\' still wild and rough and tumble.

Never played it.  Didn\'t even know they\'d created it until I joined the TML.

> T4: The vison returns, but the rules go screwy.

Everything I\'ve read about it convinces me that M:0 is just the TNE without 
the pesky Virus, and with Humaniti still on top of the food chain.  So 
where\'s the Great Change?

Personally, I like the idea of the Rebellion.  Empires are born, grow up, and 
die.  History tells us this.  Nothing lasts forever.  IMNSFBHO, *let* the 3I 
die.  It\'s all just part of the process.

I\'ve mostly run CT, with some MT rules thrown on top of it.

From what I hear, the beginnings of the Imperium were more like 10,000 knife 
fights behind a bar compared to the 3I at its peak.  But then, the historians 
had 1100 years to clean up the mess and make it look pretty and grand...

I still haven\'t figured out how to design a starship using MT rules.  *HOW* 
do you allocate space for a reactor when you don\'t know how big a reactor 
you\'ll need?  I *do* appreciate the post-TL15 tech additions to the ruleset, 
even though this kinda tech in *MY* TU is rather hard to find and control.

True enough. Recall the famous Thompson "Tommy Gun" 
submachinegun, designed for the government to use in the trenches
in WW1, arrived too late for service, produced for civilian use after the
war. The movies gave it a popular image with the public as a gangster\'s
weapon, but the overwhelming majority in private hands were used by 
security guards of legitimate companies (like the Brinks Armored Car 
company) and other presumably law-abiding citizens. I\'ve seen a 
Thompson ad of the late 1920\'s that shows a rancher scaring off some
rustlers with a burst of machine-gun fire.

I\'ve heard it argued that the movie-hyped image of the Tommygun as
a gangster\'s mass-murder weapon is directly responsible for the 
gun-control movement in the United States today, as the Thompson
SMG was one of the first (if not *the* first) personal weapons explicitly
restricted by the federal government.

I currently play Traveller using the T4 rules with modifications according to
the T5 drafts (especially the "its harder than I thought rule"). For background
setting I use either my own custom non-canon Magellanic Clouds setting
or The Interstellar Wars or the Luriani Protectorate around 100 (which is
sort of M0). I like the M0 setting, it (and the moral questions raised by the
Cleon School of Contact) had huge potential, but most people (and
authors) seemed to get hung up on some sort of dungeon crawl for RoM
technology. Pity, the era has a lot of potential.

However my opinion of the various versions of Traveller.

CT - The heady adolesence and early 20\'s of Traveller.
I played it for 10 years, I loved it for 10 years, but by the end it was like
a grand old lady; beautiful but very definitely showing her age.

MT - Travellers first signs of maturity and responsibility.
I played it for 5 years, it was okay. Compared to CT\'s elegant (if
occasionally annoying) simplicity, it was clunky and didn\'t feel quite right.
I didn\'t like the rebellion, it didn\'t seem neccessary. The slide to Hard
Times was pandering to the dominant "Dark Future" theme that was so
popular back then.

TNE - Traveller\'s last fling and grab for its youth.
Read it, didn\'t like it, didn\'t play it. The Virus just plain sucked, a poorly
designed plot device that could have been done so much better (although
it was much much better than what DGP had in mind). If MT was clunky
compared with CT, TNE was (to my taste), heavily overengineered.

T4 - Traveller\'s midlife crisis and the messy divorce.
Played it, liked it. The rules system has a lot of promise, but the messy
presentation and lack of consitant vision prevented it from achieving its
promise. If it had been properly developed, the setting had a lot going for it.
In the end it was doomed by Imperium Games\' failings.

T5 - Traveller\'s settles into a comfortable maturity
Have the drafts, play it, like it. It builds on T4 and fills in its holes and gaps.
To me, it recaptures the simplicity of CT and gives it a good dose of MT\'s
maturity. I hope it sees the light of day.

GT - Traveller the swinging middle aged divorcee
To me, if T5 is Traveller settling down into maturity, GT is Traveller going to
nightclubs and dating SYT\'s half its age in an attempt to turn back time. GT
is presented in the same style of CT, but to me it just seems like trying to go
back to something thats past and should be left there. Don\'t get me wrong,
GT is well packaged and presented. It recreates CT\'s feel fairly well, but it
just doesn\'t work for me.

I should have realized that 6 psi wasn\'t going to be *that* toxic.

Oh, it\'s true there are possible problems with the idea. On the other
hand, if they *do* have a sufficiently similar biology, then that extra
billion years is going to have resulted in some rather tightly
integrated ecologies. Ones that won\'t have anyplace for our poor terran
"primtive" organisms to compete.

It might also be the "thick, high" atmosphere. Below a certain altitude
either the partial pressure of oxygen, or the presence of some other
atmospheric component makes the air unbreathable without artifical aid.

Examples are Niven\'s "Plateau" (the planet that has Mount Lookitthat)
and the planet Victoria from an old JTAS (based on "Prisoners of the
Sky" by McCapp.

Nerve impulses *aren\'t* all that fast. I seem to recall a figure of
something like 150 feet/sec. The problem with pressure waves is keeping
them restricted to the nerve channels, so as to avoid "crosstalk" in
the brain and other areas where nerves are closely packed.

I\'d love to find a reasonable way for an organism to create carbon
fiber. And buckytubes would be *really* neat, but even less likely. 

I wonder if an organism could find a use for buckyballs? 

Hmmm. Silly thought. A "cell" that uses a modified buckyball as a cell
membrane. It\'d need one of the *big* ones though. Not a mere C-60. Say
several hundred or even thousand atom ones.

It\'d be the ultimate in "inedibility". Which might make it worth the
cost of the required enzymes.

Reproduction would be harder, as you\'d have to expand the "shell" then
go from "football" shape to a sort of "dumbell" and finaly to seperate
spheres.

    a) Anyone have a copy that they don\'t want any more?
    b) anyone have a FLGS that has a copy?
    c) or - anyone know of any online places that might have it available?

Before I get flooded with responses, yes, I do know one is for sale on

interested in buying it for its collecto\'s value - I\'m simply interestd in
_using_ it (elements of my camapign are shamelessly borrowed from Brin\'s

        I would suggest to you that the underlying presumption about metoric
assault is incorrect.  I do not believe there is a requirement for anything
*but* the Marine on the ground;  no squad weapons, no light field-peices.
Specifically, the Marine is carrying an FGMP and wearing battledress.  His
platoon has a battlecomputer terminal and a forward observer skill.
        If the FGMP is too small for the job, he calls in an orbital laser
strike from his drop ship.  The FGMP does 15d damage, and has a burst radius
IIRC.  A USP 3 laser strike from orbit will be needle precise and at least
as effective as a 105mm howie.
        The vehicles would be coming down by attack shuttle only after the
Metoric Assault Troops (MAT?  Welcome MAT?) have got a semi-beaten down LZ
for them.  You can do alot of beating down with FGMP\'s and ship\'s lasers.
Oh, and for the "big stuff", use ship-mounted meson bays on it.  Saves you
trying to drop a meson sled down.

It\'s a throwaway line about Sanctuary from Heinlein\'s _Starship Troopers_. 
It proceeds to make a rather odd implication about human evolution, that
the lack of radiation would mean that residents of Sanctuary would somehow
"fall behind" their more heavily irradiated counterparts elsewhere in the
galaxy and suggests that they ought to consider deliberately setting off
nuclear weapons in the atmosphere to increase their background radiation
count and keep up in evolutionary terms.

We\'re comparing four episodes of Crusade with five full seasons of B5.
The early episodes of B5 weren\'t all that great either; in fact, the 
pilot was *terrible*. I stopped watching Babylon 5 partway through
the first season because I didn\'t think it was going anywhere. Sometime
late in the third season, I started watching it again, and was amazed
at how it improved. (I\'ve since been able to catch the entire series
on reruns.)

Come to think of it, I can say the same thing about early episodes
of Star Trek TNG (most of the first season was pretty bad) and
DS9... Heck, I recently caught a very early episode of The Simpsons
and remarked at how bad the animation looked...

If Crusade\'s ratings on TNT are halfway decent, there is a reasonably good
chance that the Sci-Fi Channel will pick it up. Early reports indicate that
Crusade\'s ratings *are* not too bad. And up here in Canada, Crusade airs on
Space (our SF cable channel) and is getting *great* ratings...

May I suggest the Barlax II or Dumont (from 101 Starships)?

Barlax II-class Assault Lander (GTL12)

Meteoric assaults are flashy and have caught the public\'s attention, but
most Marine landings use purpose-built assault craft like the Barlax II, a
refit of the venerable Barlax assault lander. Heavily armoured and equipped
with a formidable pair of plasma guns, the Barlax II can safely deliver a
reinforced platoon to a hot landing zone, then support them until the rest
of the regiment arrives. Upgraded drives and electronics allow it to carry
more armour and still boast over three times the acceleration of the
original class.

Dumont-class Assault Lander (GTL12)

A small landing cutter designed to deliver a heavily-equipped platoon under
fire, the Dumont class is popular with mercenary units. Heavy armour,
impressive fire support capability, and good acceleration make it ideal for
commando and striker missions.

It seems to me that there is a correlation when it comes to the reaction
to GURPS Traveller -- the people who like GT are those who were already
fans of the GURPS system to begin with (myself included), while those whose
reaction to GT is less than favourable are those who are not overly
familiar with GURPS. (Example: the thread that started with someone 
misinterpreting a suggested possible disadvantage for a Marine, thinking
that it was a mandatory disad...)

        Contra-grav, and retro-rockets will buy you a whole lotta leeway on
dropping something.  Hell, we "dropped" and then repeatedly *bounced* a
probe on Mars last year.  Orbit ought to be *simple* by the time you figure
it is safe to use one-man disposable pods as a viable way to attack a planet.

To be fair, Doug did seem to present his vision of Marines as people
who had never heard a gunshot without hearing it through a suit of
Battledress. He presented the suggested possible disad as a natural
follow-up idea to his vision, and I think it was the vision itself that was
rubbing people the wrong way.

Uhm... slight detail problem here. Parthogenesis can produce *female*
offspring. It can\'t produce *male* offspring (the mother doesn\'t have
any Y chromosomes).

Leonard Erickson (aka Shadow)
 shadow@        <--preferred
leonard@     <--last resort"

	As I was looking at the last paragraph, I thought that you 
	commenting on the posibility of parthenogenesis being wide-
	spread in reptiles. Once again, I am taking responsibility 
	for this misunderstanding.

"I say A, your reply tends to be "but B is wrong". See the problem?
Like I said, you are refuting points I never made."

	This is because I though that you said B, and was not 
	corrected.

"Then give me the respect of actually looking at what I *said* and
replying to *that*, not to some side issue."

	I have done my best to do so.

"Above, we have me stating that "you can\'t get males via parthogenesis"
and you replying "parthogenesis doesn\'t require males". in our other
big "debate" I keep talking about the limits on exoskeletal creatures
that "breathe" via spiracles (or "trachea" as you started calling
them). You keep dragging in stuff like book lungs. Or I talk about
size without actually *specifying* "maximum \'minimum distance to
surface\'" in that post though I\'d been quite specific about it in
previous posts, and you go on about length, mass, and wingspan, none of
which relate to the sort of "size" I\'d already established that we were
talking about."

	As I have tried to explain, spiracles are the openings in the
	cuticle that lead into the trachea. This is not something that
	I made up, I am trying to share such knowledge of entomology
	as I have. Book lungs are the site of gas exchange in spiders.
	I mentioned them because you had added spiders to the 
	discussion. I brought up various measures of size because I
	wasn\'t sure which one you meant. Length is important if gas
	exchange only takes place through specific locations. For 
	example, the tissues in an insect\'s legs must get their O2
	(eventually) through the spiracles in its thorax.

"I\'d *love* to get better data on stuff from someone who knows. I\'m
glad to have found out that the "female offspring only due to lack of Y
chromosome in mother" limit only applies to mammals, for instance.

I\'m not an expert. Just someone who has read widely and is good at
retaining the gist of it, if not always the specific details. "Wide but
shallow" you might say. 

But I\'m getting *really* tired of "corrections" that have little or
nothing to do with what I\'m talking about."

	I am doing my best, but I cannot always tell what you are 
	talking about. This is just as much my fault as yours, but
	it remains true.

"In short, respect *me* enough to make sure you understand the context
before replying. That includes not forcing me to repeat in great detail
things that were established in previous posts."

	I don\'t need "great detail," just enough to know where you
	are coming from.

"As I said in the beginning on the "size of \'insects\'" bit. My reading
says that there\'s a limit of about an inch for the distance to the
surface for spiracle based respiration. I\'d welcome a better figure, or
even range of figures."

	This is just what I have been trying to give you. We do not
	know what the limits are, and I have been trying to give you
	a sense of that.

"But why should I have to keep repeating things like "maximum \'minimum
distance to surface\'" when I\'ve already stated (many times) that this
is what I meant by "size". Or go thru the "no, I\'m *not* talking about
book lungs" bit every post when that *too* has been stated several
times."

	Because I could not think of any reason to expect that a spider
	of a given weight had a lower "maximum, minimum distance to
	surface" than an insect of the same weight, I was looking for 
	clarification. As you were talking about spiders, you were
	talking about book lungs, whether you knew it or not. Rather
	than ask about it, you chose to complain about it.

"I am *not* writing journal articles. I\'m carrying on a *casual*
discourse, and as such I have every right to expect the other
participants to rember what parameters were established in previous
*recent* messages.

	Again, I am doing my best to do so, and I am sincerely sorry
	to have set off this series of hostile posts.

"You could be a great resource. But not if I have to spell every single
detail out in every post. Like I said, *you* are responsible for
remembering the context established previously. That means remembering
how things were "defined" only a message or two back, and responding
based on *that*, not on assuming that the words are now being used
differently."

	I never made any such assumption. I have always tried to
	respond in good faith.

"If you can\'t, I\'m going to have to figure out how to filter out your
posts, simply because there aren\'t enough hours in a day to
re-establish the context with every message. Nor is there any reason to
subject myself to a constant barrage of well-meaning but off-target
"corrections". I don\'t need the annoyance."

	Your choice, of course.

Its not that I\'m unfamiliar with GURPS. I am reasonably familiar and
comfortable with the system (I just don\'t play it because its not to my own
personal tastes). My "problem" with GT, the reason I don\'t play it using a
different rule set is that theres something too much like CT for me. Its like
the whole feel and style is too much of a reproduction of CT for me.

Now, like I said, I loved playing CT back in the 70\'s and 80\'s. It was right up
there with RuneQuest as one of my two favourite RPGs. But a few months
ago I tried to play CT again. It just didn\'t feel right anymore. I guess I\'ve
moved past CT and it no longer suits me. Thats the problem I have with GT,
it just isn\'t right for me. Its like when I listen to my old Sex Pistol or Clash
records now, its fine for a brief bit of nostalga, but it just doesn\'t fit me
anymore.

I will wait for it to reach playtest then. I do not want to 
judge your ideas further with only the bits I dislike. I would 
rather comment on the whole. The other is doing you a dis-service.

I still game. Now I play T4 (with the modifications from the T5 drafts) for
my SF games and CoC/RQ3 for most everything else. I use T4/5 because
for me it managed to capture just the right amount of CT\'s feel while still
managing to feel different.

(I have also been known to occassionally gather together with some
friends from my dim past and play AD&D at secret locations when we\'re
sure nobody\'s looking. But that comes under the nostalga heading.)

	It\'s worth remembering that all males above 14 years of age were 
required by law to practice with the long bow one day a week.  In this 
case, it wasn\'t a weapon they *happened* to be proficient with it was 
one they were *required* to be proficient with.  More akin to the Swiss 
military putting an assault rifle in people\'s homes than the US\'s 
private gun ownership.

The main problem here is that the canonical Traveller drop capsule is a
one-soldier unit, big enough basically for a trooper and their most
elementary gear. Outsize drop capsule = BIG STINKY TARGET for the ground
defenders. Remember that drop capsule troops have a period of
vulnerability from launch until landing. Following Heinlein\'s model in
STARSHIP TROOPERS, STRIKER assault capsules have extensive ECM systems to
gum up defenders\' targeting, and also generate chaff and have armor, and
high-survivability capsules also launch several dummy capsules and are
more heavily armored. Capsules also "jink" and maneuver to avoid being
tracked as ballistic objects. The bigger and heavier the capsule, the
bigger a target it is when dropped as a ballistic object. Capsules are
cheaper than dedicated dropships, and more survivable in the long run (50
tiny, weaving capsules with 250 tiny, weaving dummy capsules and a cloud
of chaff are MUCH harder to kill off than one 50-soldier modular cutter,
and cost far less.)

Battledress troopers are their own vehicles, their own heavy weapons. Want
direct-fire plasma/fusion weapons? It\'s the standard-issue shoulder arm.
Want indirect-fire support? Call for ortillery from the main ship, call in
the squad RAM Auto-GL gunner, or break out a shoulder-fired tac/drone
missile. Want armor? You\'re wearing it. Want to move fast? Add a grav belt
and stick to NOE or those AA batteries that shot at you on the way down
will be your new friends. Integral vehicles, separate heavy weapons and
other frippery are redundant to battledress troops. They provide a "shock"
force, which can\'t maintain a sustained long-term assault, but they pave
the way for grav-based vehicles and larger landing craft (carrying
non-battledress troops) to land. They don\'t need their support until a
landing zone and base of operations has been secured.

That always seemed like a cop-out. A scout/recon unit should have
something a bit more mobile than an air/raft: more like a speeder in
performance. Since a speeder is also covered, one would assume that the
vehicle\'s crew would be unarmored vehicle crewmen rather than
battledress-armored troopers. It seems more like laziness on the part of
the person writing the article: just because 1980\'s scout/recon troops
used a jeep, and the air/raft is a Traveller "jeep" equivalent doesn\'t
mean that it\'s the right tool for Traveller scouts.  Grav-belt equipped
troops with battledress (and some extra sensors and a laser carbine for
ortillery target designation) sounds better for TL-15 scout units, with
perhaps a few fast speeders for rapid movement and getting out of Dodge
before their grav tanks can get you...

Um...mostly false in most parts of the world.  While there were areas which
restricted possession of weapons, by in large in most parts of the world if you
could afford military weapons, you could have them.  The problem is that
military hardware tends to be _expensive_ -- and thus, if you had enough money

Um...learn your physics.  If you take a ship with a strong magnetic field
aligned along its axis, and you hit it with charged particles, the protons will
curve one way, the electrons will curve the other way -- but _neither_
direction is towards the ship.

Its only always pointing in the same direction if you\'re using an immovable

Well, it cost the US a lot of the soldiers on those helicopters, too.
As well as the prolonged captivity of the hostages.  They were taken hostage
in 1979.  Held 444 days.  Released on January 20, 1981, IIRC.  A few minutes
after Reagan was inaugerated.

There are a lot of handwaves for this one.  What was the time frame for this
outfitting? 1100...1090? What was their mission? No one ever said that the
Marines were welded inside their battledress.

Let\'s not forget the technology advancement factor. The Imperium is very
conservative and technological innovation moves at the speed of snails on
Valium. But I would expect that during a war some spurts of technological
innovation are possible, especially in the manner of ironmongery, i.e.
weapons systems, sensors, armor, powersuits, etc.

Personally IMTU I don\'t intend to have military actions operate at the same
level of technology as can be purchased by a group of Free Traders, who are
just making their ship payments.

It\'s called roleplaying. Just because high powered battlesuit exist doesn\'t
mean that everyone\'s got them. When I run a game set in the present my
players might want a AK-47 to carry through JFK so they have enough
firepower to take out the baddies. But I\'m not going to let them through the
metal detector with one. Same thing.  Will a munchkin player want Marine
Commando Battledress? Sure. Will I give it to him(her)? Probably not. But if
I do, you can bet that if they try to wear it at some civilian starport a
dozen Marines in similar dress will let them know that\'s a no-no. And if
they try to wear it in the bush against an opposition force they\'ll suddenly
find that the bad guy has a surplus grav tank or a big can opener.

Basically I reserve the heavy duty military equipment for a military
campaign.

Easy. You use iterative design, a real-world procoess that most gamers seem
to have a rabid fear of. :-/

Basically, you estimate how much power you\'ll need, put in that reactor,
and then after the ship is finished go back and adjust as necessary. You\'ll
have to keep tweaking a few times (iterations), but then you\'d have to do
that anyway for various other design elements. (At least, you\'ll need to
tweak if you want an optimized design.)

Heh.  Calling the fungus a single organism is somewhat stretching it (and in
any case, its mostly underground, so it isn\'t really a land lifeform).  Its
nowhere near the maximum size for a plant in any case -- there\'s nothing
physically preventing a plant or plant-like organism which is, say, a meter
thick and covers a million square kilometers, weighing around a trillion tons. 
Its evolutionarily unlikely, however.

        In fact, a good spreadsheet or program design can goal-seek most of
your targets for you, by simply building the reactor to meet
power-consumption requirements each time you make a change.

And all it cost was a few million bucks\' worth of TOW and HAWK missiles,
spare F-14 parts, and a chocolate cake...

ObTrav: Perhaps a Traveller adventure involving cover-up  of a
prisoner-exchange plot during the Fifth Frontier War, between the
Imperium, seeking the freedom of captured nobles, and the Zhodani,
seeking examples of advanced Imperial weapons technology for their
examination? How far would the Imperium go to cover up such an
incident--and how much would an interested journalist/minor Imperial power
faction/megacorp/etc. pay the adventurers to turn up evidence of such a
transaction--or to cover it up? Perhaps a fanatically patriotic Imperial
Marines lieutenant-colonel, Olivaari Spinward, would make an interesting
NPC, either hounding the characters to abandon their pursuit of the truth,
or a great aid in helping them cover it up...

Wasn\'t there a scandal about delaying the release until after the
inaugeration, so that Reagan would get the public credit rather than Carter?

ObTrav: The players are a special forces unit (appropriate to YTU), sent on
a hostage rescue mission. After they have started the first phase of their
carefully scheduled operation, they get word that their expected support
will be delayed a few hours/days (select appropriate period) so that the
new CO (younger son of an important noble) can get the credit.

Depending on how you want to play this, the new CO may have ordered this,
strongly hinted that it would be a desired outcome (leaving his staff to do
the dirty work), or be blissfully ignorant of the whole thing (in which
case his aide-de-camp is responsible). Or to be really twisted, this is the
outgoing CO trying to set up the incoming CO as a publicity-seeking
incompetent, so that the old chap can retain his command after the fiasco
comes to light.

Hm. _Kinunir_ is one of the gaping holes in my collection of original
Traveller digest-sized stuff (dammit!) so I haven\'t read that particular
description (now I need to go haunt the misc.games.frp.marketplace
newsgroup for one o\' those...) My information came from STRIKER Book 2,
which specifies three types of drop capsules: The basic capsule (Cr2000),
which is just the re-entry package, no armor, no ECM, intended as a
last-ditch emergency lifeboat or for landings in areas without planetary
defenses. The assault capsule (Cr10,000) has extensive ECM equipment and
generates a quantity of chaff, is lightly armored, and non point-defense
weapons have a hard time even targeting it. The high-survivability capsule
(Cr50,000) is an assault capsule that also releases several decoy
capsules, has better armor, and may not be fired upon except by
point-defense weapons.

Meteoric assault troops might be harder to spot than, say, a large
troop-ship, but they\'re still noticeable due to the IR signature of the
re-entry capsule, and the variety of active ECM/jamming material. One can
assume that the chaff/ECM is based around a radar-absorbing/passive
ECM/stealth-cloaking metaphor, rather than the "fill the sky with fake
targets" idea, if one prefers a more covert entry method--or perhaps a
variant "stealth capsule" (say, Cr100,000) that features extensive RAM and
stealth features, IR suppression, solid armor, and other "Stealthy"
features for that HALO-entry effet.

Of course, you wouldn\'t have to worry about heat and shielding doing a
drop on an airless world--but then your parachutes wouldn\'t work and
grav-chutes/thrusters would be required for braking. If it ain\'t one thing
it\'s another...

        I would suggest that since the drop is orbital, "stealth" is
pointless.  You most likely had to beat your way through the SDB\'s, silence
the ground-based defenses, move into orbit and then conduct your MAT
roll-out.    If the ground-based opponent hasn\'t clued in they are under
attack by now...  =)
        Ground based systems will be targeting the IR plumes of the reentry
vehciles -- plasma temps, IIRC...  you want to give them *plenty* to fire
at.  Active jammers, decoys, counter-battery fire, etc.  The "sky-full of
targets" approach will temp the defenders into flashing up their FCS, which
you then target from orbit with ship\'s lasers and meson strikes.

Nothing provable, unfortunately, since William Casey, the man who knew
everything, died rather conveniently, without telling much.

There is considerable evidence that the \'arms for hostages\' bit started
before Reagan was president. The logical (and obvious) step is the
recognition that Iran releasing the hostages was quid pro quo for later
arms deals.

Worse, your entire mission is compromised so that the noble\'s rival can
gain power. 

Of course the pc\'s don\'t find this out until after the mission starts,
when they supposedly land, find the hostages gone, and themselves in a
major **** (rhymes with \'mustard duck\'), such as an ambush. When they
manage to drag themselves out of it, they find themselves in legal hot
water over their suddenly \'unauthorized\' rescue attempt....

Why black ops can be so much fun to inflict upon players....especially
the ones just hot to do that cool \'play with big guns\' stuff.

What I heard was that the Americans treated the planes as if they were the 
latest and greatest, and especially played with taking the avionics to the 
limit - trying to turn the planes at very high speeds, flying low at high 
speed, etc. The Harriers weren\'t ever meant to be good at this, and in fact 
were not as good as several planes which had been in commission for some time, 
and so a few were lost.

While there is *some* evidence that Reagan campaign staff might have
influenced the Iranains to hold onto the hostages until after the election,
odds are that the hostages were released when they were as a final insult
to Carter.

One thing that someone mentioned was using large, brightly colored panels
as a defense against chameleon BD.  The armor takes on the nearby colors,
leaving the unfortunate user bright orange (or whatever) when he moves out.

The battledress I\'m designing also has an integral laser weapon, a small
gauss weapon built into the arm, and a box 40mm grenade launcher.

The Marine might carry a specialized anti-armor missile or other type of
weapon, but Marine fire teams aren\'t built around a support weapon like
normal infantry squads.

Imperial propaganda makes much of "slow-moving, dense" Sword Worlders but
their characteristic naval architecture is the result of the Imperium\'s
vast technological lead. Outranged by Imperial weapons, Sword World ships
must be prepared to survive several volleys of fire before closing to
within range of their own weapons; the resulting mass severely lowers their
maneuverability. Unable to force a battle in open space, Sword World
tactics rely on forcing the Imperial Navy to assault specific targets, thus
lowering their strategic advantage.

Extremely well-armoured, the Fellbane is the ultimate expression of this
philosophy. Able to survive even point-blank hits by Imperial turret
weapons, squadrons of Fellbanes are deployed in orbit where they can
husband their limited fuel while inflicting punishing damage on the
assaulting ships.

Much of his campaign had been centered around how much of a wimp Carter
was. Were there not an October surprise in the offing, Regan could well
have been a disaster for the Iranians. 

Regan would have had ample reason to order a large-scale military attack
on Iran, which would put them down as well as rattle the saber right on
Russia\'s doorstep. (who would have been loathe to support the Irani
regime too much, given their existing quagmire in Afghanistan)

The Irani regime had ample reason to dislike Carter, but I really cannot
believe, after all the bombastic rhetoric of Reagan\'s campaign, they
didn\'t believe that Carter was the lesser of the evils.

Unless, of course, they already had a deal in place with Reagan...

obTrav. The Spinward Marches, while considered the backwater of the
Imperium, has been the historical springboard to power in the Imperium,
particularly following a war with the Zhodani. Thew first resulted in an
abdication. It was the winner of the second who started the Civil war,
it was the winner of the next that ended it. 

Three of the five wars with the Zhodani resulted in the fall or
abdication of an emperor. Why didn\'t the Fifth do that? (The fourth
could be discounted as more of a skirmish than a war given it\'s short
duration and resolution before anyone at Core knew it was happening...)

As later events showed, there\'s strong current of unrest in the
Imperium...a victorious admiral could have come out of the Marches again
and forced Strephon to abdicate in his or her favor.

This was the rumour going around at the time, but I have never seen any

Oh, it has a name?  Cool.  I realized early on that that was how I had
to design anything in, e.g., Striker but I always just thought of it as
the pain in the neck I had to endure to make my designs useful.

I doubt that the Imperium itself would get involved in such a
transaction, except maybe for a double-cross involving giving false
information or examples to the Zhodanis.  If that were successful, then
the Imperium would go into cover-up/denial mode.  Even if the exchange
is uncovered, it\'s still a win for the Imperium to admit that it
happened -- but to stick to the position that the tech examples were
real.  (Someone would have to be dishonored and forced to resign, too --
like a high military officer or noble who was responsible for setting up
the transaction.)

On the other hand, the Imperium is unlikely to value a few lives, even
of very high nobles (and how would high nobles have been captured,
anyway?), above the security of the realm, and the Zhodanis would know
that.  Therefore, it would have to be a rogue operation by, maybe, a
relative of the prisoners.  It could even start out as a real operation,
but be co-opted by INI.  

In any case, I like it.

Perhaps you mean DR.  If you want an FGMP-12 to be at least moderately
effective, penetratino shouldn\'t be more than +1 standard deviation (about DR
660).  I\'d recommend DR 400 and thermal superconducting armor.  The resulting
suit will be a _lot_ lighter.

If you want, I have a suit design which is probably suitable -- its 500 lb
empty, 80% resistant to FGMP fire in the torso, 50% resistant on the limbs.

The minimum volume, assuming a 180 lb man, is 1.8 cf torso, .45 cf per leg and
for the head, .18 cf for the arms.  It probably shouldn\'t significantly exceed
twice this volume anywhere (the legs will probably have to slightly exceed this
value, as they\'re required to be 30% of torso volume each).

I have been looking recently at the history behind the second amendment to the
U.S. Constitution ("the right to keep and bear arms"), and it turns out that
for most of the colonies all males were required to be armed.  It was a crime
for a man not be armed in Massachusetts (how times change).  Generally, all
males were required to be part of the militia and show up when called with
their own arms.  In Virginia, people were encouraged to carry armaments to
church.

There seems to be no direct correlation between violent crime and weapons
ownership; cultural factors seem to play more of a part.  Once you get beyond
the rhetoric, arming citizens is not "insanity", at least not in every society.
IMTU at least some cultures in the far future allow, or require, their citizens
to own fusion guns.

100m in 10s = 22.388mph, so 20-25 is a very fast sprint.

A real kernel of truth in that. Hard to parse without specific examples.
Stone age groups in Africa and North America consisted of a warrior/hunter
class where all males were armed with military weapons for that culture.  In
China, Japan and other higher tech, move advanced civilizations this was not
true.  Even in the west during the middle ages most individuals were serfs,
whose weapons were the bow and the staff. Other things like limit of
movement, lack of the funds to buy military weapons also come into it. Much
of this is affected by whether the peasant class is expected to act as a
"home guard" or whether they are a "protected class" not expected to take up
arms.

Many Americans like to romanticize the Revolutionary Army as a force armed
with their own guns defeating the British. The truth is more complex then
that. At Yorktown the Americans used cannon and bayonets extensively. These
were weapons provided by the French, thanks in large part to the efforts of
Benj. Franklin. The fact that the French Navy prevented the Royal Navy from
landing relief forces probably had much more to do with the British defeat
that anything else. I also suspect that most American\'s at Yorktown were
armed with rifles also provided by the French, rather than any hunting
pieces they might have owned themselves. I don\'t know for a fact but also
suspect that such hunting pieces were not properly configured for bayonets.

What about Commando style covert insertions vice full assaults? Would they
be done with highly IR Cloaked assault vessels? Or perhaps under cover of a
meteor shower? Would they be limited to lower TL worlds, with operatives
entering high TL locations as ship passengers with their equipment sent as

I\'d _love_ to do this. I have a full network and server set up at home now,
but it\'sthe connection costs that are the killer, even at $1 an hour, I
can\'t afford to be connected full time, and any dial-up ISP with "unlmited"
access using charges an arm and a leg for DNS hosting and kicks you off
every few hours.

most (i.e. the legal bits <grin> ) of my 8Gb-odd of RPG material on line

Good point. Any world with regular space travel above, say TL9 or so is
going to have a pretty good junktracking system set up, if only to
minimize hazards to shipping. \'Earth\'-crossing rocks would certainly be
tracked. Any jump capsule coming in would be recognized as such.

Doing it during a meteor shower might work, but you would have to be
very, very careful. You certainly wouldn\'t want your elite commando team
to be surprised by a bunch of eager rockhounds searching for the
meteorites they tracked to the ground.

Then again, if they\'re tracking such things they will look very
carefully at anything that suddenly slowed to a survivable speed.
\'Meteoric\' assaults are such in name only...those poor schlubs in the
capsules really aren\'t coming in at 30-50,000 mph ;-) If they are, then
no worry...they burned to fine carbon dust like the rest of the meteor
shower...

The way to do it on a high TL world is to get kicked out above the
planet at a \'no-forward velocity\' trajectory, and simply come in on CG
in a highly stealthed capsule, which might as well be a highly stealthed
vehicle at this point. You\'re high, but you come in slow, so you don\'t
get the atmospheric heating.

Here you\'re much more susceptible to things like upper atmosphere winds,
but once you get down low, you can goe NOE or close to get to where you
want to be, once you\'re down below radar.

Imperial propaganda makes much of "slow-moving, dense" Sword Worlders but
their characteristic naval architecture is the result of the Imperium\'s
vast technological lead. Outranged by Imperial weapons, Sword World ships
must be prepared to survive several volleys of fire before closing to

maneuverability. Unable to force a battle in open space, Sword World
tactics rely on forcing the Imperial Navy to assault specific targets, thus
lowering their strategic advantage.

Grendel-class Lesser Dreadnoughts form a large part of Sword World
offensive capability. Large, invulnerable to turret weapons (and thus most
fighters), and relatively fast for a Sword World ship, the Grendel class
was designed to stand up to second-rank Imperial warships-and win.

Imperial propaganda makes much of "slow-moving, dense" Sword Worlders but
their characteristic naval architecture is the result of the Imperium\'s
vast technological lead. Outranged by Imperial weapons, Sword World ships
must be prepared to survive several volleys of fire before closing to
within range of their own weapons; the resulting mass severely lowers their
maneuverability. Unable to force a battle in open space, Sword World
tactics rely on forcing the Imperial Navy to assault specific targets, thus
lowering their strategic advantage.

The Helm-class fighter is a common one in the Sword Worlds. While not very
fast, it can shrug off Imperial turret weapons at long range, greatly
increasing its survivability. Like most Sword Worlds warships, the Helm
uses fusion rockets rather than reactionless thrusters, trading limited
endurance and radioactive exhaust for better performance.

IMTU is a mega corp known as Star Services, Inc. One subsidary company is
Star Security Services. One technique used thereby is call a "Burn Down".
After clearing a planet of major air defenses, the Security Cruisers align
in orbit north and south of the equator at several kilometer intervals, and
drop speed just enough to decelerate into the atmosphere. They don\'t slow
much, just enough to survive the massive fire trail and sonic effect. No
real physical damage done to the planet, but the psychological effect the
skies on fire and seemingly endless rolling thunder has certainly improved
the sense of co operation the locals have.

  Somewhat odd that the Iranian student revolutionaries* had such a fine

(who is called much worse by his own system, e.g. a lame duck), but had
not the least clue that they had made themselves and their country radically

Baron/Marquis/Duke Caranda\'s attack on Menorb.

Canonically, the fight was just between different fleets.  A fleet would pull 
into a system, refuel, revictual, give the crews some shore leave, then head 
out again.  The \'locals\' weren\'t involved beyond selling the fleets supplies. 
 The Imperial bureacracy continued on, unimpeded and unmolested.  No fleet 
really had a \'power base\' external to itself.

More like, two fleets meet in space and fight until one withdraws.  Then the 
victors head for the planet to resupply and repair.

It wasn\'t a \'real\' war per se.  None of the \'barracks Emperors\' ever had a 
following on a planet or any region.  Most of the people didn\'t *care* who 
claimed to be Emperor, just as long as they kept the violence out in space 
where it belonged.

The Rebellion was a whole \'nuther parable, though.

Which is why I mentioned the original drop-troops scenario as being a
high-profile, active-ECM affair that would be hard to disguise. But while
a large-scale raid might be that dramatic, it wouldn\'t be hard to
envision, say, a particularly stealthy scout-type ship (for GURPS
Traveller players, perhaps a _Pytheas_ class scout craft) firing assault
pods into an undefended portion of a world--or, for a world with no
atmosphere, there\'s no worry about IR plumes.

But yeah, your typical drop will be about as subtle as a brickbat to the
face.

the Traveller universe).  GURPS has done an admirable job in filling source 
material from the twenty years and hopefully will continue to so but the 
rules are akward and do not allow for fly-by-the-seat of your pants role 
playing.  But hey! The putting together all this information from twenty 
years is admirable until referees can purchase the SMART and AAB on 
CD-Rom...
Lots of my comments concur with earlier submissions.

CT: It\'s the vision thing indeed.  Particularly, Keiths\' FASA work & DGP 
Grand Tour.  Like when one Star Wars for the first time, one knew Space 
Opera would never be the same.  But, the simpleness of the rules weighed it 
down as one had to consult literally hundreds of tables.

MT: The rules of choice; the task system was absolutely brillant innovation 
as one say to one\'s players Mmm looks DIFFICULT and get on with playing 
instead of thinking up a number.  Plus, the rebellion was the logical 
outcome out of stagnate and decaying 3I never seemed that way in CT.  But, 
come on we Navy types always need an excuse to move a Fleet out of base 
other than just showing the flag.

MT-HT: The logical outcome of the Rebellion.  The bloodletting leading to 
collapse as the factions wage ideological warfare.  Winning the hearts and 
minds, costs lives in the real world.  The problem with it was the collapse 
happened too quick.  Looking at the Roman Empire as historical parallel many 
other Kingdoms (eg. Bzanthum, Holy Roman Empire, Rennaisance City States 
[particularly the Papal states]) claimed the title of Rome long after the 
Barbarians had moved on.  So GDW had destroy all vestiges of the Imperial 
Campaign... so now we come to:

TNE: The setting destroyed, the rules confounded, and PC\'s made into
merely rescuers of civilization. Some merit.  But, given everything save the 
Hiver civilization and pocket empires surviving lost the PCs in the 
immensity of the universe.  So I had the PC from the Reformation Coalition 
discover Grandfather\'s fluxuating wormhole network allowing contact with the 
other Pocket Empires (even though most ended up in empty space, heh, heh).  
This way confront the Virus on a more fair playing field.  As I tended to 
emphasize the Virus threat rather the rules which stressed the virus was an 
occasional phenomena (hey, I was caught up in the black mood)at the loss of 
the precious-s-s 3I. FF&S the most usable supplement ever produced by 
Traveller was the result of TNE so I cannot completely hate it as my players 
(imperial navy characters who refused to retire) did.

T4: The vision somewhat returns, but the rules go screwy.  The only decent 
thing was Milieu 0 and episode 1: Gateway.  The rules held so much promise 
that they would cover from the time of the Ancients to the Far, Far Future 
but failed to deliver.  But there was great artwork (Chris Foss) and an 
attempt not to use the same starships which commonly characterized 
Traveller.  First I hated it but it is like the Phantom Menace it grows on 
you like a rather but fungal disease.

GT: Earlier comments still apply.  Would be interesting however if GURPS 
could take us to places only previously suggested.  Eg.  FASA\'s Far 
Frontiers sector, deep into Alien Space--eg. what makes the Zhodani, K\'kree, 
etc civilizations tick (and beyond Chartered Space), and finally produce a 
supplement covering the 3I at its height and in all its glory.  There are 
many things on the dream list.  GURPS at least allows us to dream once again 
in the light (like CT) not like later editions which prompted us to Dream of 
Chaos.

Oh come now, this is *much* more fun if we throw in the "evil megacorps".
Think of it, in the opening days of FFW, an LSP courier, with the regional
manager on board, is captured.  LSP is of course highly motivated for his
return, and knows it will get little support from the 3I.  Enter the PCs:
"We just need you to make a delivery, and pick up some passengers..."
Thinking they will be safely removed from the war zone, our PCs happily
oblige.  Then we throw in all sorts of fun complications- the 3I found out,
a competitor Megacorp finds out, and either uses the info as blackmail,
tries to get the manager themselves, etc, etc.

Do you even need to-hit rolls anymore in BD?  Missiles can\'t get through and
the firer is toast, RAM/RPG\'s can\'t get through and the user is toast.
Snipers can\'t hurt it and the sniper is toast.  Consealed troops can\'t hide
from it and are toast.  Mines cannot harm it (and I\'m sure something will be
toasted in the interim).  Sounds like exciting game mechanics to me!

Why make it so much bigger and badder if all that does is make it usable
against much weaker foes, if with each upgrade of the armour, a GM is
compelled to instigate newer weapons to handle it?  I mean, are you going to
give the PC the new version of the "SuperBD" and let them use it for an
in-game year untill the enemy introduces a weapon that takes it out?  Sounds
like great fun playing an invulnerable character for that time, no
challenge, no chance of being harmed... well, maybe it doesn\'t.  At least in
CT, BD was more even.  You were at least vulnerable and needed it, perhaps
to stand a chance on the battle field, not invulnerable and able to
withstand EVERYTHING on the battle field.  But who cares about playability?

 With MT, the VAST majority of your power requirements wil be the weapons, 
particularly if you go with lasers. With a lowly triple laser turret 
consuming a whopping 750MW, even the maneuver drive will start to fall behind.
 Figure out your weapon load and get a power figure for it. Get a power 
requirement for your desired maneuver drive. Add the two together, add 
another 10% to that, and install a powerplant to that spec. It\'ll be right an 
awful lot of the time...

 While I haven\'t yet, I can certainly port my old (Excel 2.2) MT design 
spreadsheet into ClarisWorks. From there, several exports are possible.  My 
spreadsheet is primarily a calculation assistant instead of a wholesale 
designer, which means you HAVE to have MT Ref\'s Manual open in front of you...

* Conduction velocity varies with :-
fibre diameter
myelination
* Small unmyelinated twigs (0.3 to 1.3 micrometres in diameter) have a
conduction velocity of 0.5 to 2 metres per second (relay pain and
temperature messages).
* The largest myelinated fibres (A-alpha, 12-20 micrometres in diameter)
have a conduction velocity of 70 to 120 metres per second (relay
proprioceptive and motor messages).
* Touch and pressure afferents (A-beta) are from 5-12 micrometres in
diameter and have a conduction velocity of 30-70 metres per second.

Pressure waves are problematic for the reason you mentioned.
Microfluidic \'switches\' may be a possibility at these scales.

Buckyball cell membranes sound unlikely.
Carbon fibre \'silk\' or other similar materials (silicon carbide? boron
nitride?) might be possible ; although collagen and spidroin are amazing
bits of protein chemistry.

	No, we didn\'t lose many planes. But did you notice the altitudes at

My understanding of evolution would be that the opposite is more likely

An interesting view.  

One possible argument against it is that the *nobility* would *care* who
the Emperor was.  This is supported by the Moot endorsing some Emperors,
and not others.  The nobility then would turn to their local support bases,
planetary armies, planetary navies, reserve fleets (left-overs from the old
\'Pocket Empire\' days) and so on. 

There\'s also the stuff in Solomani & Aslan that tries to explain it in
Solomani vs Vilani terms.  This is obvious propoganda stuff that shouldn\'t
be taken too literally, but it still suggests that a bit of populism was
going on.

I would be very surprised if attempts weren\'t made to mobilise popular
support.  There are fairly obvious grounds for it:  the former Old Earth
Union (only integrated in 588), Ilelish (worked over in the Ilelish
revolt), Antares (an autonomous region), the Geonee....

I can see this happening.  An ecosystem that is half a billion years older than ours would have an extra half billion years worth of experience adapting to ever increasing evolutionary pressure.  After all, how old is our ecosystem?  Two, three billion years?

I don\'t see why not, but I don\'t have any math to confirm or deny it.

I remember reading it in a JTAS or Challenge article someplace.  And IIRC, 
there was some mention about it in the Library Data LBBs.  It started when 
Olav hault-Plankwell, Grand Admiral of the Marches, decided to march on the 
Capital after winning the First Frontier War practically unsupported by the 
Imperium due to communications lag times and general unpreparedness for the 
war.  He forced an audience with Jaqueline I and personally shot her, 
proclaiming himself Emperor by right of fleet control.

According to Library Data A-M, there were fringe battles for power bases and 
central battles for control of the Core.  But most of the claimnants opted to 
just go after the current Emperor and take the Throne by the right of 
assassination.  Of the 18 \'barracks Emperors\', 7 were assassinated, 10 died 
in battle, and Arbellatra survived.

Thing about the Minorb campaign was, it wasn\'t an attempt to put Caranda on 
the Throne.  It was more like, stomping down somebody before they got the 
chance to do it first.  A pre-emptive strike.

Half the time, the Moot didn\'t confirm any of the \'barracks Emperors\'.  They 
figured the latest claimnant would just get himself killed off when the next 
challanger showed up.  They were pretty much right.  Arbellatra didn\'t claim 
the Throne, she just offered her services as Regent until an Emperor could be 
found.

The main crisis times, according to Library Data A-M, start in 475 with the 
assassination of Nicholle and the assumption of the Throne by Cleon IV.  
Every Emperor\'s reign from 475 until Arbellatra was elected by the Moot was 
assassinated.  The one that lasted the longest was Cleon IV, who reigned from 
475 until 555.  Arbellatra died of natural causes, and the Alkhalikoi Dynasty 
lasted until 1116, when Strephon was whacked.

What did the Imperium in was the retention of the \'right of assassination\', a 
legal fiction allowed to Porfiria when she whacked out Cleon the Mad.  It 
entered into custom, and was used by eight of the \'barracks Emperors\' to 
establish their claims.  If they\'d taken this off the books, Dulinor would 
never have had a legal leg to stand on.  As it was, Dulinor only half-did the 
job.  If he\'d taken out Lucan as well, the Rebellion might have been put off 
for a few more years, and it might not have gotten as violent and destructive 
as it did.  When Cleon the Mad was killed, he had no clear heir and no 
dynasty behind him.  Same for Nicholle, once Plankwell killed her and her 
immediate family.  But Strephon had plenty of heirs, both by direct lineage 
and by indirect lineage through his father, Paulo III.  That\'s what threw the 
monkey wrench into the jump drives.

Keven, won\'t StarOffice\'s spreadsheet run the Excel sheets without

No clue.  I tried using SO on some old Word 2.0 files I have laying around,
and it barfs bigtime.  Upside is, it works just fine with Word9x files.  I
haven\'t tried it on spreadsheets yet...

BTW, it took me like *14 hrs* to download the latest version.  73 megs at
14.4 *sucked*, lemme tell ya.

I understand that the warfare was primarily naval, and that the various
naval factions didn\'t try to destroy each others\' sources of supply. 
That\'s the key difference between the Civil War and the Rebellion.  The
Civil War disrupted (and worse) a lot of Imperial member states, but it
didn\'t involve wholesale destruction of economies.  

One of the underlying reasons for the civility, if you will, of the
Civil War is that the citizens of the Imperium never really got engaged
for a number of reasons.  One important reason is that none of the
contending parties was trying to make any real changes in the way the
Imperium worked; they were just fighting over who would be the king of a
very rich hill.  The Rebellion, by contrast, was primarily about
regional forces pulling the Imperium apart.

Bravo!  I would only add that the manufacturer of mines can usually be
identified in some way, by label or peculiar characteristics of use. 
The battledress sensors would automatically record that information and,
at an appropriate time, transmit it back to the fleet, which would then
take the necessary steps to ensure that the manufacturers\' facilities
would be made into toast.

Of course I\'ve been looking through the Library Data books, and the MT
Imperial Encyclopaedia.  Unfortunately there isn\'t a whole bunch of detail.
Well, that\'s probably a good thing, really, but it means for my current
purposes the answers aren\'t quite there.

If you can find the article you\'re remembering, it would be really handy. 
I don\'t have all the Journals and Challenges, so I may have missed
something, or I may have just forgotten something I have read.  Of course
the other possibility is it could be something from the \'Satanic Verses\' -
DGP \'canon\'.  I haven\'t got much of their stuff.

The way it\'s described in the article, Caranda is a supporter of
Arbellatra, and the Menorb bureaucrats are aligned some other way.  This
is an example of one of the peripheral campaigns, where a faction
establishes and safeguards its power base.  In this example, it actually
occurred in 623 - after Arbellatra had seized Capitol.

It may also have been part of a localised power grab by Caranda.  This is
entirely compatible with him lining himself up with a more powerful patron.

 In fact, these local power struggles are probably the ones that a Civil
War period campaign would involve, since they are small enough for PC
groups to affect, they contribute to the bigger picture, and can in fact be
a microcosm of the overall struggle - a kind of \'bathtub\' version of the
war.

And this is where traditions like that of the 4518th Lift Infantry come
from.  Strike From Space!

I\'ve drawn up a timeline for this period.  I arbitrarily started in 401, to
allow the inclusion of the Ilelish Revolt (418-435).  Yes, the crisis
started well before Olav\'s coup.

Okay, then I have to mention the one I skipped originally. Creosote
bushes. If you check from the air, you\'ll find that they form various
sized *rings*. Turns out that those rings are all "one bush". I vaguely
recall that they found one several miles across.

Apology accepted. But I still don\'t see how you could contrue the above
as any sort of attempt to say that males were involved in
parthogenesis. I was basicly inplying "If you are producing male
offspring, it ain\'t parthogenesis".

Actually, I don\'t recall you mentioning that, but I\'ll take your word
for it.

My reason for avoiding "trachea" is that trachea are not *just* "blind
tubes from which gases diffuse into the internal tissues" (that *is*
what they are in insects, right?). 

They also are the passages carrying air to lungs. And I was
*specifically* trying to exclude lungs.

I only brought in spiders to show that since they *didn\'t* use the
mechanism I was discussing, they *weren\'t* subject to the same limits. 

I think part of the problem is that you know "too much". :-) you go
with a technical use, even when a non-technical one was intended.

The most frustrating thing in all this was trying to find *some* word
or short phrase to use to refer to the type of breathing I was talking
about. "Breathe like insects" didn\'t work because I immediately got hit
with "you won\'t find insects in other evolutionary trees". 

Trachea have the problems described above. And refering to spiracles
(which I thought referred to the hole *and* the tubules) led to yet
another mess. 

About the only thing I haven\'t tried (partly because it is *too*
imprecise) is "diffusion breathing".

The thing is, I\'ve *seen* the "about an inch" *given* as a limit
somewhere. I just don\'t recall where, except that it was in the sort of
context where you\'d expect the author to know what he\'s talking about.

<sigh> As noted above, I was using a spider as an example of an
"similar" organism *not* subject to the limit *because* it used a
different mechanism for breathing.

And again, I *really* don\'t see how you could have seen it as anything
else. :-(

It\'s a *series* of 4 published books, and who knows how many
unpublished. The published books certainly don\'t *finish* anything. 

The basic idea is that there\'s a plague early next century, and as we
are recovering from that, various obvious *non*-Terran animals and
plants start showing up in various places around the globe. And either
taking over or destroying the eco-systems they are in. 

Best guess is that it\'s a bio-war based attempt by aliens to wipe
humanity out and "Chtorr-form" Earth so they can colonize it.

The name for the aliens (Chtorran) comes from the sound made by the
first one of the species that looks like it *might* be intelligent. 
A sort of caterpillar/centipede/worm critter that\'s several meters
long and at least a meter in diameter. And makes a shark look anorexic.
They also move like a Grendel on speed.

Yeah, I *do* kind of enjoy Gerrold\'s comments on the human conditiion,
even if they require that some of the main characters be *real* jerks. 

But more than that, I\'ve gotten interested in the *puzzle*. What *is*
going on. Will humanity get absorbed? Destroyed? Triumph? And *why* is
all this going on?

But the likeliest explanation *does* seem to be that Earth has wound up
on the wrong end of a "terraforming".

        There are a couple of good XWindows spreadsheet programs that will
allow this sort of thing.  Heck, worse comes to worst, get a copy of Perfect
Office for Linux and use the spreadsheet package that comes with it, which
is just as feature rich as Excel.

        Hi!
        IMHO, one thing to keep in mind is that BD is a *weapons system*.
The M1 Abrhams was not built to give the Bad Guys a fair shake.  It was
designed to kick the $hit out of whatever was stupid enough to stick around
to fight.  The objective of combat is "to destroy the enemy or his will to
fight".  Note the second half of that.
        If the fireteam sees the BD Trooper moving in on them and puts up
their hands because they know they can\'t win, then *that* is a properly
designed set of BD.  If they say "hmmm....  we\'ve got 30% odds of taking him
, theres 4 of us, *he\'s* screwed...  Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-BLAM" then that is *not* a
properly designed set of BD.
        If you are concerned about playability, what are your players doing
in BD *anyway*?  That\'s like complaining that the Trepidia they are a crew
of is too tough?
        And if a BD Trooper goes nose to nose with a Trepida, I would expect
his next of kin to recieve a "The Imperium Regrets to Inform You.." message
by X-Boat.  That\'s reasonable...  BD aren\'t Trepida, and non-BD infantry are
not BD Troopers.  A BD Trooper ought to have a weapon capable of
mission-killing other BD, if only because if he does not he is reliant on
support systems which limit the usefulness of BD as an assault or
storm-attack tool.  This might lead to an arms race...  just like in the
RealWorld(tm). 
        If your players are in the buisness of wearing BD or killing BD,
then they are part of that arms race and if they aren\'t shelling out the MCr
to stay on top of it, then they get whacked.  There is considerable game
balance there...  they have to pay top credit to stay alive, which means
they either pick tickets that don\'t require dealing in or with BD, or they
pick tickets too dangerous enough for anything *but* BD.  I don\'t see that
as a problem, so long as they have to work within that framework.
        If somehow they wind up outside it, in BD that they cannot be
threatened for example, then I would suggest that it is the GM has to find
out how they got there.  Not the rules author.
        Again, JMHO.

Yup, it\'s got a name.

I teach iterative design in my Analysis and Design class, using Traveller

Depends on whether you count from the beginning of life, or from the
beginning of multi-cellular life.

I think the intent in the Chtorr stories is that if you take two
species that have similar "niches" but where one has been defending
said niche against all comers for a few hundred million years and the
other hasn\'t had to fight for it as much, or hasn\'t occupied it more
than a million years or so, guess which will win.

From the evidence of things like Australia, and various isolated
islands, the more "advanced" critter will wipe out the less advanced
one in short order. 

And the differences can be pretty "minor". Placental predators like
dogs and cats wiped out marsupial predators all over Australia and
Tasmania. Partly it was reproductive efficiency, and partly it was
coming from a "tougher" eco-system.

And it\'s that "tougher ecosystem" part that is likely most important. 

There *are* lots of niches where critters survive by adapting to the
niche by *losing* abilities. Tapeworms are an extreme example of this. 

But more "general" categories (like the ones in the Traveller animal
encounter tables) tend to overlap and have a lot of competition.
*Those* are where you look for critters to use in eco-warfare. 

Predators who are *really* nasty. Herbivores who\'ve evolved nasty
defences. Plants that poison their competition.

One critter I recall from the books had apparently taken the "cuckoo"
strategy even farther. It somehow (pheromones?) was *more* attractive
to mammalian mothers than their *real* offspring. So not only was it
more likely to get nursed, but it made better use of the milk, and
could induce the mother to speend more time than it should nursing. End
result is the true babies starve and the *mother* becomes less able to
survive. I think they were *able* to eat "real" food fairly earlier,
but kept nursing as long as they could "force" the mother to. Then,
when she was too weak (from the combo of producing all that milk and
not doing enough foraging) they\'d eat her.

Nasty, but one *hell* of a way to eliminate competition, if you can
pull it off.

As I noted in response to someone else, it doesn\'t necessarily work
that way. 

You *do* get more critters in specialized niches. But there\'s a limit
on that. The more specialized your niche, the more likely it is to be
limited in extent, or to not always be available. 

The main thrust of the larger organisms is to be able to survive better
in a fairly *broad* niche. This tends to require a moderate degree of
adaptability. It also tends to require the ability to stand off all
comers who want to occupy that same niche.

Maybe, but I rather doubt it.

BTW, Lagrange points *aren\'t* "null gravity". The L1, L2 & L3 points
are local *maxima* in the curvature of space (think of them as sort of
"hills" with round tops).

L4 and L5 are local minima of a sort. Sort of like "saddle" curves.

And part of the stability of *all* the points is due to the motion of
the primary and secondary bodies. 

I *do* know that "trojan points" (L4 & L5) disappear rather suddenly as
the ratio of the mass of the primary to the secondary drops below some
point (20:1?). They do *not* exist if the bodies are the same size (ie
a 2 body "rosette"). 

There might be an L1 type point at the center. And in the case of only
2 bodies forming the rosette there might be a point *beyond* each body
along the line joining their centers. But I wouldn\'t bet on either.

	This is a toughy. Natural selection will tend to produce
	organisms that are well suited to a particular 
	environment. That environment includes the other 
	organisms in it. Environments on Terra have changed over
	time, so that organisms well suited to their environment
	now might have a great deal of difficulty competing with
	Jurasic organisms in some Jurasic environments. On the
	other hand, some evolved traits have proved to be 
	advantageous over a broad range of environments.

	For example, placental mammals (those that feed their 
	offspring through a placenta) appear to be more efficient
	at reproduction than marsupials ("pouched" mammals) or
	monotremes (egg-laying mammals). For that reason, just 
	about everywhere that placental mammals have been able to 
	get to, they have replaced the other groups. On the other
	hand, the opposum has successfully competed in the 
	Americas.

	An interesting process that may be important is the 
	"evolutionary arms race." This occurs when one species
	evolves a trait that helps it to compete with (or eat
	or escape) another species, then the second species
	evolves a trait to overcome the first, and the first
	species evolves another trait... For example, a 
	parasitic worm infests certain fish as they feed on
	plants. This imposes selection favouring fish that can
	see and avoid the worms on the plants, which selects 
	for worms that are more difficult to see. Perhaps an
	improvement to the fish\'s immune system aids it in
	killing the infestation, then the worm evolves skin
	proteins that make it difficult to detect...

	The longer that a biosphere has been evolving ("long"
	in terms of number of generations), the more time that 
	it will have had to \'come up with\' new adaptations that
	would give organisms an advantage over previous ones.
	A higher mutation rate could also increase the number of
	potential adaptations available. Nevertheless, moving 
	into a new ecosystem in which you have not evolved is
	likely to be difficult. It is also possible that, just by
	chance, a younger biosphere will have \'come up with\' some
	important adaptations that never evolved in an older one.
	In addition, if an immigrant species has to compete
	directly with a native species that fills a very similar
	\'niche,\' the native one has a big advantage in being 
	already well-suited to its environment and well-established 
	in numbers.

	We often hear about species that are invading new areas on 
	Terra (rabbits in Australia, Dutch Elm Disease in North 
	America, etc.), but we don\'t hear about the many species
	that are no doubt introduced but do not survive in their
	new home. I would suggest that, in general, the number of
	species that can successfully invade a new environment is
	much smaller than the number that cannot, but that species
	from \'longer\' evolutionary trees may often have an 
	advantage.

Ecosystems do not \'get experience\'. Ecosystems simply are. The various life
forms filling the niches of those systems may be more or less adaptable, but
that\'s true no matter the ages of the system. Ecosystems change, sometimes
gradually, sometimes catastrophically, but there\'s no accumulated
\'evolutionary experience\'. As proof of that look at the various mass
extinctions that have occurred here.

The earths ecosystem 2-3 billion years ago would be, in Traveller terms, an
insidious, exotic atmosphere with no hydrosphere. 200 million years ago, most
of the worlds land masses were tropical or semitropical. 30,000 years ago the
Earth\'s ecosphere was a marked division between warm equatorial regions and
ice-locked northern and southern regions, with a tiny, moving temperate zone
in between. We seem to be moving towards a hotter ecosystem today, which may
or may not be influenced by human activity.

Species that have become adaptable enough to survive mass extinctions, on a
geological scale are \'more fit\' but in the time frame of conscious human
activity no evolution takes place. If the older ecosystem fluctuates widely in
conditions on a human time scale, then a sentient evolved in that ecosystem is
going to be more adaptable than humans, but it has nothing to do with the age
of the ecosystem, only that it\'s been around long enough to evolve humans (or Chtorr).

um, "lame duck" is a standard term to describe any officeholder who has
been voted out of office but has not yet left it (between election day and
inauguration day.) And the delay of the release of the hostages\' timing
had more to do with the secret weapons deal they struck with the
Republicans than a desire to insult Carter.

ObTrav: The ruling party of a democracy faced with a political crisis
(like a hostage situation) hires the party to sabotage ongoing
negotiations by the ruling party\'s opposition, who plan to resolve the
crisis and come out heroes before the upcoming election, or at least
prevent the ruling party from resolving the crisis.

The team are equipped for infiltration/sabotage: whether it turns into a
non-combat sabotage fest or a huge bloodbath (Let\'s sabotage their
negotiations with howitzer rounds!) is up to the GM and the players...

For example, when you walk, your center of gravity is ahead of your
feet. You are continually "falling" forward, but placing your feet so
as to keep from completing the fall.

They\'re moderately friendly to mecha and battlesuits, but not dreadfully so. 
The reason GT battlesuits look tough is that GTL 12 \'advanced laminate armor\'
is about 5x stronger, weight for weight, than bonded superdense (the \'advanced
metal\' which tanks have is only about 3x stronger; the \'expensive metal\' used
in starship armor is about 2x stronger)

IMTU, the Civil War was a war of the Admirals.  Since the Imperial
bureaucracy managed to keep rolling, I have to assume that the large scale
dislocations of the Rebellion never happened.

Since several Barracks Emperors were enthroned by "Moot vote", I\'d say the
battles were a mixture of intrigue and actual fleet actions.

Except that the Iranians hated the Soviets almost as much as the US.  And
vast portions of the former Soviet Union were inhabited by Persian-decended
Muslims.  Having a President how believed that Communism was the ultimate
evil helped distract the Russians, allowing the Revolutionary Council to
stir trouble in the Islamic SSRs.

Amazing the things you learned with a security clearance in the mid-80s.

No, he proclaimed himself Emperor by right of Assassination, an important
distinction.

The right of assassination had been used before, to remove Cleon the Mad.
The rules stated that the assassin had to do the job personally and be of
high noble rank.  

The right of Fleet Control was a polite fiction coined by historians for
those circumstances when a pretender orbited Capital and threatened to slag
the Moot unless given the Throne.

We keep coming back to this point.

Look, there exists today the M1A2 Main Battle Tank.  It is bloody
nigh-invulnerable.  It\'s main gun can shred the frontal armor of most OPFOR
vehicles with ease.  It does over 60mph cross-country.

Just because it exists, does not mean that a character in a modern-day
Espionage game will have one.  And if he does every see one, he better pray
that it\'s on his side!

Outside a military campaign, these things should never, ever show up.  The
AD&D equivalent would be a Lich with the Hand and Eye of Vecna wield the
Rod of Seven Parts.  The average PC group will be severely outclassed.

Classic Traveller was last published in 1986.  That\'s thirteen years ago.
If you want to play Classic, fine.   Have fun.

But in GURPS, you can build excellent armor.  The design I\'m building has
850 points of armor on the torso and head, somewhat less on the arms and
legs.  That will still allow a penetrating hit by a FGMP-12 about 10-15% of
the time.  As an exercise, I shot my armor with a AP round from a M1A2, and
it shredded the armor.  So just get a TL7 tank and you\'re set.

Battledress has been a standard part of the Imperial Military for over a
thousand years.  I seriously doubt there\'s be any problem outfitting any
unit that required it as part of their TO&E.

Combat replacements is another issue, but since century old starships seem
to be canon, I imagine that BD can be moth balled if the need arises.

Nah, get a 60mm TL 9 antitank rocket.  Does 6d*15(10), since its laminate we
only divide DR by 5, total of average 315 pts against effective DR 170. 
Including the launcher, about a 6 lb system.  60mm electromag grenade launcher
is also viable -- same damage, 1.1 lb per shot plus 6.5 lb for the gun, range
440 yards.  I have TL 8 battlesuit designs (not designed for GT) which have a
chance of killing TL 12 BD (not a very good chance...but its 4 TLs lower, what
do you expect?)

I\'d go with the former, because (a) the bureaucracy continued to function,

A formidable ship by local standards, the Slakter class is typical of Sword

Doug, I think part of the problem is that, although GURPS Traveller
originaly claimed to be porting the Traveller setting to GURPS, as you (and
other writers) use more and more GURPS rules you are beginning to alter the
Traveller setting.

For example, the GTL12 \'advanced laminate\' armour is a lot better than
bonded superdense. Unless weapons have also got a lot better, this will
alter game balance _if_ the advanced laminate is used.

This type of thing is going to be a problem for every GT writer, not just
yourself.

Remember the limits on laser size we eventually came up with for TNE? We\'ll
probably have to do that for a lot of things in GT too. For example, David
Pulver commented that if you allow lots of turret armour you can end up
with invulnerable turrets, USING THE RULES HE CREATED, which is a major
change from Classic Traveller, which he was trying to emulate. So now we
either accept that the setting has changed, or add a backward-compatible
fix to the GT rules.[1]

FWIW, I think you should aim for a battlesuit that is not invulnerable to
non-BD weaponry. Maybe the suit could have weak points (joints and seals,
say) that a _really_ good sniper or lucky hit might penetrate.  Hm, what
about a joint hit that just _locks_ the joint, rather like a tank throwing
a tread?  Also, whatever suit you design must be able to fit inside a
standard starship corridor without leaving gouges in the walls.


[1] My personal favourite is to add motors to the turrets, so that heavier
turrets can have fewer weapons. I haven\'t had the chance to check this in
VE2 yet though, so it might not be GURPS-compatible.

Much of the problem is that in many ways, traveller TL 15 is really only about
TL 10 in GURPS -- probably be more accurate to call TTL 8-9 GTL 8, TTL 10-12
GTL 9, TTL 13-15 GTL 10.  Then you _really_ have to muck with such things as
nuke dampers and contragravity, though, and you probably have to shift fusion
power by a TL as well, plus it winds up being overall pretty low resolution,
which is kinda annoying (hm...zhodani and imperials are same TL).

It isn\'t really worthwhile to build invulnerable turrets, though.  I usually
cap their DR at about 4,000, and frequently less, because when you have 150
turrets, who cares if you lose one.  I\'ve got better uses for that tonnage.

Well, realistically any armor should have weak points like that, but VE doesn\'t
really have any rules for aiming for weak spots.  If you want to add a rule for
that, I\'d go with an \'eye shot\' variant -- -10 to hit, divides DR by 10.

VE2 doesn\'t bother with designing turret motors.  I\'d just put a weight cap on
armor -- something like 20 tons per space (or just require turrets to have same
armor ratio as the body).  That would limit a turret to DR 3750 at TL 12.  It
can also theoretically affect ship design, though with the exception of really
slow SDBs its very hard to create a viable ship with that much armor anyway (it
would make heavy tanks illegal -- the Intrepid has 162 tons of armor in a 4
space frame -- but that can be glossed over)

(Where can I get one? ;-) Look, the *obvious* answer to Tank/BD/Misc. would
be Tank/BD/Misc., right? And GURPs has maintenence requirements, which CT
doesn\'t cover, AFAIK, but we mainly have CT books and errata, and the Melieu
0 book but no other T4, TNE, MT, or GT stuff (a friend has much GURPs, but
no GT).  We therefore so far play strictly CT campains, with house rules
based around CT canon (as far as the \'spirit\' of the law, if not the
\'letter\' in some cases).

My impression of BD in CT. When I first played Traveller I was a marine, I
had the skill BD(2 I think), and upon mustering out I did not get to keep
the BD of course. BD is expensive as well, so I am not buying it either.
Don\'t tell me I
*can\'t* get it, I\'m a GD IM! ;-) I\'ll go to Gunn if I have to, but, uh,
first I need some more money.... I held BD in awe, a trophy to acquire, and
found myself an ex-merchant who needed some security, recruited a crew, and
away we go!

Now that\'s hyperbole, right? And some campains *are* military. I

got my BD. And I can\'t be turned by *any* level cleric.

 Uh, yeah. Unless the investment doesn\'t seem economically feasible, my
marine character want\'s to be on the cutting edge. Design flaws may make a
certain model a lemon, but I would not get rid of my old suit. If I could
not afford the new suit while retaining the old, I\'d wait. If I could, I
would start out by testing the new BD in a non-hostile evironment(well, for
BD), then gradually up to full combat.

I still say that BDvsBD, TankvsTank, yadda yadda yadda....look, I think all
that you are overlooking(both side of the debate), is that the systems are
vastly different. All that I hear about Gurps BD makes me(CT only) say
"Yeah, that is what I was assuming I could do" except for the 70 mph running
bit, but hey! ;-) And can\'t individual suits of BD in GURPs gain quirks or
something as their maintenence score erodes? I don\'t know much about GURPs,
but a friend has it.

I am playing CT, and I am having fun, and I am advising other CT players to
ignore that crack. I am sure it is not indicative of the entire GURPs
community as my GURPs playing friend also plays CT. Bare bones CT. As I
said, our resources were disasterously depleted.

See? GURPs has limits, and they apply across the board. As long as all
vehicles, structures, etc, are created under the same rules, I fail to see a
problem. I\'m not sure I like a TL7 tank busting me up, but I wonder, did you
just shoot a suit, or pit a BD trooper vs a TL7 Tank?  ;-)

Corel ported the entire office suite to Linux???  *COOL*!!  Last I\'d heard,
they\'d just ported Word Perfect over.  I used to use Paradox a *LOT*, and I
think it\'s one of the *best* databases out there, and *WAY* overdue for
porting to Xwindows.  <grin>

Quite a sensible option for weapons that don\'t break down easily - esp.
if the crew carry regular long arms in the drop as well (reason - you
don\'t want to be the trooper who survived the drop, but don\'t have a gun
since your heavy weapon pod was nuked..)

Favourite for light support weapons. Everyone has a bit in addition to
their basic load - whether it\'s a part of the weapon or a round of ammo.

Nightmare. The odds of this system not being available after the drop
are far higher; and you\'d only need to employ this method on a major
weapon system. Better to use a `cargo\' sized pod rather than a regular
troop pod.

Far better than (3), above. If there\'s a requirement for this class of
weapon system IYTU, then there\'s probably a range of standard pod sizes
for cargo.

...or (modern day example) light fighting vehicles, like the (cancelled)

Not even close. Using Desert Storm and the operations in Bosnia & Kosovo

I guess the poster meant Iraq. Now, I think a couple of a/c there were

Reactionless thrusters are expensive and inefficient at lower tech levels,
but they are a lot safer than fusion rockets. The Kjerre-class freighter,
and ships like her, are a common sight in the Sword Worlds Confederation.
Heavy and lumbering, she shuttles slowly along her route.

Kjerre II-class Freighter (GTL10)

As inefficient as GTL10 thrusters are by Imperial standards, they are an
incredible improvement over the average Sword Worlds technology. When the
Kjerre-class was refitted her acceleration increased four times, and the
reduced engineering crew enabled her to carry a few passengers.

Only a pocket one, I\'m afraid. The names really should be Icelandic, but I
figure this is better than nothing, and I\'ll save the Icelandic for when I
get better at designing GTL9 ships.

Feel free to suggest names... (that\'s a hint, BTW)

My take on it was that it was a series of military coups and
murderous intrigues, with comparatively little actual \'pitched
battles\'.  Significant pitched battles would likely have
significantly disrupted the operation and communication of the
Imperial bureaucracy outside of the "Imperial" function; this is
canonically not the case.

A good image might be the sort of purges and "palace coups" that
went on when a new faction took over the Soviet politburo, but
slightly bloodier, with "selected" Army divisions (probably "x
Guards Army"), KGB units, and GRU units taking active part in
support of a candidate.

Accurate description: as the name implies,  Star SERVICES provide the
equipment and personnel to who ever has the cash. Security is only one
aspect, the among the other subsidaries are Star Transport (taxicabs to bulk
interstellar freighters), Star Communications (local net, publishing, news &
entertainment up to the private equivalent of the X-boat network), Star
Administration (any time of paper pusher you care to name), Star Life
Services (medical & such),etc. The politicians like to make big noises about
how the Government is the biggest and best, but a close look shows that most
daily work has been farmed out to sub contractors, of which the Star Service
is the biggest. 

You want to start your own company? No real knowledge of the business? Call
Star Services; everything you need from equipment to staff. 

Theoretically, the government (I won\'t say Imperium, since the resemblence
to the offical universe is rather slight), states that privately owned armed
vessels may not exceed "cruiser mass". Nice nebulous phrasing. In general
practice, anything smaller than a Plankwell or Kokirrak is considered legal.
Problem is that no adjustment for the effect of tech level is included. A
199 KT "cruiser" at Tech Level 11 and a 199 KT "cruiser" at Tech Level 15
pack somewhat different punches. And the Star Service stays on the bleeding
edge of technology. 

In practice most Sector and Sub Sector administrations are left on their
own; Central Naval Command provides the big stuff and "Guidelines",
"Certifcations", and "Recommended Practicies"; local patrol is local concern.

My roommate, who has an MS in Astronomy, says that this would be
a good subject for a Master\'s thesis, or possibly a PhD
dissertation.

I seem to remember that in Robert Forward\'s "Rocheworld"
(expanded from the earlier "Flight of the Dragonfly", but
substantially identical), there _were_ "LaGrange" points
"between" the two lobes of the title world.  Since the two lobes
were of equal mass, the points were at +/- 90 degrees, rather
than +/- 60 degrees as in the Terra/Luna system. (N.B. -
recommended read.  Most recent info is ppb, 470pp incl
appendices, NYC, Baen Books, 1990, ISBN 0-671-69869-9)

It seems intuitive that there would be a "LaGrange" point at the
revolutional center of the system (where the non-existent sun
would be). Can\'t speak to others.

The Third Frontier War caught the Imperial Navy flat-footed and unprepared,
its ships poorly dispersed and its logistics a tangled mess. The Zhodani
thrust towards Rhylanor came dangerously close to succeeding. Herein hangs
a taleŠ

In the Battle of Porozlo (980) the Zhodani captured an excellent forward
base for the Siege of Rhylanor (980-986). Possessing naval facilities and a
gas giant, Porozlo is only one parsec away from Rhylanor, allowing Zhodani
warships to jump in, raid, attack, and mount blockade patrols, and still be
able to jump back when outmatched.

While the Imperial Navy was officially tasked with defending Rhylanor, the
local population was not willing to trust the Navy\'s competence, especially
as the Navy\'s priority was its own bases. In a thousand desperate
skirmishes Rhylanor system defense forces battled the Zhodani invaders:
defending outlying asteroid settlements, convoying vital supplies,
harrassing and ambushing task forces-tieing up so many enemy warships that
the rest of the Zhodani offensive faltered and they made peace.

In 985 the Zhodani launched a major assault on the trailing Trojan cluster,
intending to establish an in-system base from which to assault Rhylanor
itself. Local defense forces had anticipated this move and deployed stealth
monitors in both Trojan clusters, tasked with ambushing and delaying
Zhodani forces long enough for fleet assets to arrive. By sheer fluke, when
the Zhodani task force emerged from jump space it was surrounding the
Stunnenge at point-blank range. In the crew\'s own words:

Lt Enklia: Close emergence, sir. Big. Two moreŠ threeŠ Astra, sir! They\'re
right on top of us!

Captain Petros: Sound Battle Stations. Scramble all fighters. Signal Fleet.
What are we facing?

Enklia: Sir. Two Zhodani battle squadrons with many escorts. Possibly an
assault squadron.

Lt Marcon: Jamming, sir. Trying countermeasures.

Petros: Guns, target battleships alpha and gamma. Flight, target support
vessels.

Aft Battery: Scratch Zho alpha. Shifting to delta.

Cmdr Chandry: Their last wave saturated our counterbattery. Missiles
impacting in 30 seconds!

Petros: Attention all hands, this is Captain Petros. This is it, time to
earn our pay. Gunnery captains: choose your own targets and fire at will.
No surrender, no retreat!

Chandry: Kali, we\'ve lost the port batteries. No contact with the aft sections.

Marcon: Transmitter destroyed, sir. I don\'t think our signal reached Fleet.

Chandry: Aft batteries still firing. Lost contact with Engineering.

Major Whittaker: Commandos! Mindrippers just apŠ

Petros: We\'re next, gentlemen. It\'s been an honour to serve with you. Think
free!

After two boarding attempts were repulsed, the Stunnenge was vapourized by
the concentrated fire of the Zhodani battle squadron. There were no
survivors.
Rhylanor remained free.

Editor\'s Note: This entry contradicts the official history of the Third
Frontier War as published by the Imperial Navy. While many historians have
wondered how the bridge records for a ship lost with all hands were
recovered, no Rhylanor historian has yet dared question these events. Such
is the power of local myth-making.

They are porting the whole thing, but I don\'t think it\'s out yet.

Well, according to the Discovery Channel, an Abrams can be killed with
current generation weapon systems, and even systems available before it was
designed... but in a BD comparison, you still have a crew of more than one
man operating the machine, not a single supertrooper pertending to be a tank
with the protection of a tank attached to his arms and legs

But it doesn\'t seem that a fireteam can even consider taking out the single
BD troopie before the marine gets out his toaster... no 30%, 4 of us about
it!

That reference was made in relation to the idea that the supplement in
discussion was about BD-equiped PC\'s (in service campaigns?).  Do I see 6x
PC\'s sitting down around the table with their GM, "Um, you guys won\'t need
your dice tonight, you are all equiped with BD and FBG\'s (if you are an
adult, you know what an FBG is), rocket launcers, and the usual sensor
suite... There are only you 6 against 200 enemy troops, although they have
armour support, it can\'t see you until it\'s to late and orbital support
toasts them... and I roll for all 200 enemy troops to hit you and they all
miss of course... well, those that aren\'t taken out by point defense
anyway... and you don\'t really meed to roll to hit these jerks... ummm...
Well.  You won the battle!  Wanna hire a video?  I\'ll put together another
assault for next session... maybe make it 300 enemy troops?  What do you
think..."  Sounds wonderfully playable!

But it is not proposed that IM\'s in BD are fielded only against other
troopies in BD, and I get the distinct impression that they are now special
forces that specialise in being fielded against inferior forces (SAS don\'t
normally get fielded against those who are equal or better than themselves
on a level playing field).  Furthermore, from pro-BD posts, BD can hide from
armour which cannot hide from it.  BD seems to be equiped to take out said
armour and employ all manner of counter measures against said armour\'s
weapon systems, not to mention naval support against enemy armour
deployment.

Just seems that the rules as they once stood (CT) covered everything in that
regard.  The rules now seem to say, "GURPS BD is unstoppable, but if the GM
wishes to make it so (stoppable), he will have to invest his own valuable
time in doing it, because the rules were created in the author\'s perfect
image of how things are and no-one is going to change that, so there."

        So, as I said, its a properly designed suit.
        I suppose what we are discussing, at its core, is what is
"reasonable".  The group I reff are *merciless* about min/max-ing HG designs
for combat effectiveness...  Or ground installations, etc, etc.  These guys
are *mean*... which is just as well, because I don\'t cut them any slack.  If
I handed them Gurps Vehicles and said "Here\'s your budget...  build five
mobile suits for a jump attack" you can *bet* they\'d design something
*worse* than the Commando.
        So, why shouldn\'t the NPC\'s have that kinda rude kit?

        I *can* see your point.  GT and CT Battledress are two different
animals.  GT and CT starships are two different animals.  GT and CT trade
rules are *also* two different animals.
        CT and GT are simply two different animals.
        Should they be identical in play balance?  I dunno...  How much does
that ham-string the GURPs rules-set?  Do we get into a whole other set of
hand-waves if we try and keep "power levels" of different systems between CT
and GT in line?  I suspect yes.
        I personally doubt I will ever own GT.  I played enough Fantasy Hero
to get a good idea that generic systems do not do niche systems well, IMHO.
However, if the rules are there, I find it unreasonable to say "just because
another game engine doesn\'t do it that way means you can\'t do it like that
here".  If folks wanted to play CT, they\'d beg, borrow or buy copies of
CT...  folks are buying GT because that\'s what they want.

>Well.  You won the battle!  Wanna hire a video?  I\'ll put together another

        Give me one guy with a TL6 flame-thrower, a forest, and another five
guys with TL9 shoulder-fired chemically pumped anti-tank lasers and I\'ll
make a mess out of your six PC\'s.  The other 194 infantry can be doing
something useful like repairing the anti-ship defenses of the planet.  =)

        All silliness aside, in pure set-piece battles of unsupported
infantry against armored vehicles  or armored suits, it\'ll be a massacre.
It should be.  That\'s why they build them.  I agree, its boring as hell to
preside over slaughter.  So, why did you send your players on that mission?
        I\'d would have sent six serious suits against a vital target area on
a "grab the general" mission where there are auto-cannon, emplaced Z-guns,
sonar and lidar detection fields, tank-breaker mines, etc.  The kind of job
where they *need* that armor to have a hope in hell...  so long as they
don\'t trigger the defenses.  That\'s a good role-playing mission for PC\'s
with BD.
        Slaughtering infantry is best done with the abstract rules in Book
4: Mercenary.  In fact, if you consult those rules,  a TL 15 squad (BD and
FGMP) vs TL 8 infantry battaltion (flack and autorifles) gets a DM of +2 on
the die roll for damage inflicted...  the battalion gets a DM of -1.  That\'s
6 to 452;  the BD guys have \'em out numbered!  If they both throw a 3 on a
d6, the BD guys take 5% casualties (6*.05= 6 hits damage on one guy) and the
battalion takes 20% casualties (90 WIA/KIA).  God help the battalion if the
BD guys are firing from ambush...
        CT Book 4.

        Um...   I must have missed some of Doug\'s posts, because what I seem
to remember is him saying that BD/ FGMP is *standard battlefield kit* for
*Imperial Marines*.   If they run into "Home Town Suits", then that is what
they are fighting.  If the target is TL8 infantry, then that is what they
are fighting.  I believe I posted that it is entirely possible -- the math
supports it --  that the Imperial Marines are 11000 brigades in strength...
That is a *bit* big to be a special forces unit...  16.5 million Marines.
        No, they are simply the most heavily armed assault forces in the
Imperium.  Which is, if as a PC I were the Emperor, *exactly* how I\'d want it.

        Look, there are some monster presumptions there.  First is that the
Naval attack on the system defense forces was sucessful in allowing the
Troop ships to move out of the Reserve.  Second is that planetary
bombardment against emplaced surface weapons and deep meson sites was also
successful, allowing those Troop ships to move into orbit uncontested.
        The war is *over* at this point.  All that is left is securing the
C3I sites around the planet....  which will be the things that you just
can\'t tac-shoot from orbit and you *need* to have control of.  So that is
what you will be attacking, and that is what the planetary army *knows* you
will be attacking.  So that is where he\'s going to stack his forces.  So you
roll out your brigade of MATs, take 30% losses on the landing from
point-defense systems and anti-air batteries that have been silent until
now.  The MATs start tearing up the area to secure an LZ while the Troop
ships work at picking off those PDS and AAW sites from orbit.  
        Sure, it\'l be LAW-rocket snipers vs BD.  It\'ll be tanks chasing BD.
It\'ll be booby-trapped buildings vs BD.  It might even be BD vs BD.  The
enemy is going to be doing his ernest best to kill every trooper you\'ve got,
because if those attack shuttles get down ok, then the war is *very* over.
        So *any* *competant* BD designer is going to build a suit to *deal*
with the threat environment it will have to survive.  Anything else is
*negligence*.  No, it isn\'t very fair.  War is not about fair.  Its about
killing the other guy, preferably under condtions where he is unable to do
anything to threaten you.

        War is miserable for role-playing.  It doesn\'t treat PC\'s as
special, it doesn\'t give a rat\'s a$$ about game balance and its full of
tragedies.  As a ref, I try not to directly involve my players in "war".
See my TNEC "Saviour\'s Race" game log on my web-site (URL in sig) if you are
interested in seeing what I get players to do when there is a war on.

        I see your point here.  However, unless one wishes to run an
entirely pre-fab game, a GM invests time into the campaign world anyway.
How much is up to them.  I\'m pretty extreme about it...  I don\'t do canon at
all.  Everything in my game is a scratch-build, pretty much, except the rules.
        Now, if you want to use out-of-the-box (OOTB) adventures, OOTB
history, OOTB equipment, OOTB starships, OOTB starmaps, etc and this is a
grinding point, yeah, you\'ve got a problem.  OTOH, if you ref GT, you are
most likely familar with the G:Vehicle rules and can do a more YTU-friendly
BD variant and declare it to be the suit in use by the IM.  I am sure you\'ll
do at least one starship;  what\'s the difference?

Check out Dawkins _The Selfish Gene_ for a slightly better model of
evolution than darwins. His premise is that the gene is the unit of
selection, not the organism or species. The organism is essentially, under
the dawkinsonian model, a replication machine and protective coating for
the genes combined. Which helps explain such phenomena as hives, single
breeding pair colonies, and the prevalence of harmful recessives as
disorder vectors.

Essentially, non-harmful, but likewise non-helpful ("Neutral") genes can
build up in organisms. Recessive "low utility" traits also accumulate. For
example, take a mature area... genetic traits for breaking down certain
chemicals which do not normally occur are a common enough recessive in
humans (ForEx: some 1 per 1e5 or so can digest Aspartame as a useful
sugar)... but, in a situation where that becomes an advantage, those who
can will benefit, and thus be slightly more likely to succeed. On the
obverse, many such minor mutations carry minor enough costs that they are
not likely to fail because of one or two of these becomeing active. The
gene itself continues to be replicated by the persons carrying the inactive
recessive at almost negligable cost, and thus when a new environment where
the active version is a benefit, those with the active version will be able
to rapidly adapt, and use the adaptation (and normally pass it on). Very
few other traits can be so easily checked for.

Also keep in mind that humans carry genes for gills, tails, and large
ammounts of body fur... they just happen to be switched off in normal
development. Longer development periods would allow such neutral genes to
build up....

The problem is in figuring whether the old can use the new, the new can use
the old, both can, a portion of each can, or neither can... Some scientist
(I forgot who) recently estimated that, based upon total genetic lengths,
we probably only use some 60% of our DNA.... and much of that only in the
womb.

There will be a "Synthetic" central mass, which (Someone more
scientifically trained please correct me if I\'m wrong) is based upon the
mass of hose items in the rosette orbit, and their distance from the center
of mass of the system of the rosette. This SHOULD result in some lagrange
points... (I\'ve modeled this on computer at one point, but the program had
one programming glitch... it sequentially proceeded object by object (each
object getting vector changes, then moved), rather than figuring all vector
changes then applying them and finally moving the objects each frame.

Note also that a close binary of similar mass stars creates a synthetic
mass at it\'s center of mass (which will lie on the line between the center
of mass of the two stars), and that is the real center of the system for
orbital mechanics.

You either didn\'t read all my posts or are choosing to ignore them.
Repeating: Just because an item exists doesn\'t mean that it is appropriate
for use by PC\'s in all situations.  I\'ve always limited use of high powered
items like BD\'s to the appropriate military campaigns. Just as I limit the
use of F-15\'s or Bradley Fighting Vehicles to military campaigns when I run
a contemporary GURPS game.

It\'s the GM\'s job to make sure the game is balanced.  I\'m had games
(non-Traveller) with planet busting world killers. Was that boring to my
players? I hope not. They seemed to enjoy it. I\'ve also run espionage games
where the heaviest weapon was a 45 cal handgun.  Use what the situation
requires. If you can\'t find a use for BD, don\'t introduce it into YTU.

I agree, but: In MT, tech level differences often make little difference in
performance.  In TNE the differences again tended to cluster around certain
breakpoints (many of the FF&S1 tables were direct lifts from MT).

Breakpoints (Listed as TTL) in MT by category.
Vehicular Armor Materials	5,6,7,9,10,12,14,17

[1] there are small differences between these in terms of minimum size.
[2] note that some begin higer in the scale. Also this category is actually

Gurps, however, in vehicles has almost all technologies improving per each
TL; a much different approach. to TL\'s, as well as the expressed "non-fit"
between GTL and the available materials and the TTL->GTL conversion
process... this latter is more than just "equivalent TL, as note every GT
"advance" is parralleled by Traveller.

For Battle Dress, the important Breakpoints  past TTL 11 should be:
Armor	(breakpoints at 12,14,17)
Fuel Cells (BP at TTL 13,15) &/or batteries
Legged locomotion (no Trav changes past TTL 12)
Commo Breakpoint at TTL 12,14,15,16
Sensors Breakpoint at TTL 12,14,15,16
Gravitics (BP at TTL 12)

Consolidating these TTL\'s 11,12,14,15,16,17
Twice as many changes as GTL\'s 10-12
And the net measurable effect is less in Traveller than in the jump from
GTL10-11...

Of course it\'s hyperbole.  If the campaign is military then Battledress
might be used, but so will the weapons that will penetrate it.

Let me put it this way, would you wear a bullet proof vest that failed one
time in ten?  Use a parachute design with that failute rate?  The best
Battledress that I can come up with (and I\'m still in the early noodling
around stages) that doesn\'t "scrape the corridor walls" as someone put it
has armor with that level of protection against a FGMP-12.

So our mighty Marines aren\'t strolling through eveything.  Against the
Freedonia Milita, yes.  They\'ll ignore most attacks.  But againsy other
pros, they\'ll have a real fight on their hands.

My point is that CT exists, is enjoyed by many, as is *not* being published
by SJG.  Trust me, if I do write the book, and put a substandard suit of
armor in there, I\'ll hear about it and dozens of "fixed" versions will pop
up on web pages.  I want to do it right the first time.  So your merchant
characters can\'t stop the Marine.  That\'s why he\'s a Marine, and you are
merchants.  If nothing else, aim for the visor (-9 to hit, 1/2 DR)

Just the flat armor.  Since the penetrating damage was a bit over 200
points, I think we can safely say that the Graves Registration Unit was
equipped with sponges and small baggies for this one.

If you go back 150 years, what do you think the leading military lights of
the day would say about a modern infantryman, able to produce singlehandedly 
a volume of fire equal to that of a contemporary company at ranges only the 
cannons can reach.

Infantrymen today have more capabilities than when I was in during the
1980s.  Kevlar helmets, body armor you can wear in hot conditions, GPS..

A battlesuit trooper doesn\'t think he\'s a tank, he thinks he\'s a trooper,
and that how he trains and fights.

That\'s where tactics come in.  Time and again in Vietnam, the wildly
outgunned Viet Cong would successfully attack American formations by using
hit and run ambushes.  You have to develop anti-BD tactics.  

Set up an anti-armor missile as an off-route mine with a mechanical
trigger.  The trigger is a pneumatic tube conceal under some leaves/debris.
 First thing weighing over 400lbs to step on the tube launches the missile
at extremely close range.. less than 20m.  BOOM.  One dead Marine.

That\'s poor GMing.  Think back to _Starship Troopers_ in the first battle
against the Skinnies, Rico and his section leader have to deal with a
comrade who\'s armor has been breached.  The problem is how to make the
pick-up boat.  That\'s what a military campaign should be.  Not just endless
chanting of "roll to hit, roll for damage."

Yep.  Ain\'t life grand?

There is a very simple solution.  Excuse me for yelling.

DON\'T RUN AN IMPERIAL MARINE CAMPAIGN!!	

If the concept of tough, usable battledress so offends you, run a campaign
set in the 467th Halftrack, Gravedigging, and Support Battalion (50 pfennig
to the first person to identify the reference.)  You can run Traveller for
years without ever having need to encounter, or use battledress.

Speaking as the person who wishes to be the author of this supplement..
damn right I\'m right.  Sorry if that sounds egocentric, but I have been
shot at by professional people who really wanted to kill me.  If I had been
offered a chance to pilot a suit of battledress that would offer me
excellent protection against 90% of the weapons fielded, I, and any other
sane dogface, would leap at the chance.

As I\'ve posted before, the battledress I\'m designing has a failure rate of
around 10% against advanced fusion weapons.  While that would be wholly
unacceptable in Real Life(tm), it\'ll work for game purposes.

This is a wonderful point.  War is the worst possible RPG enviroment.  If
you are active duty, them somebody is always ordering you around, useally
to do incredibly stupid things that don\'t make sense.  (Anybody wan\'t to
know what life is like for a US army infantryman?  You ride around in abox,
which tehn stops.  You run out having no idea where you are, assault some
objective, get back in the box, a ride around some more.  Repeat as
necessary.)

NO ONE EVER SAID THIS!!!  Sorry to yell, but this GURPS bashing is getting
rather insulting.  GURPS has only one core rule: all rules are optional.
Even more that most games, GURPS encourages players to use only the
material that makes sense in their game.  If you don\'t like Commando
battledress, don\'t use it.  No one ever said you had to, and I doubt many
people will.  If it ever appears in another GT product I will be greatly
surprised, because it has generated vocal opposition even within the GT
playtesting community.  (The fact that this item was never playtested
clearly contributed to the problem.)

I\'m disturbed that there seems to be an incredible fixation on this one
particular flawed item of equipment.  If you ignore Commando BD there is NO
PROBLEM WHATSOVER with the portrayal of Battledress in GT.  The standard
Battledress described in the main GT rule book is vulnerable to a wide
variety of individual weapons, including grenade launchers, gauss rifles
(firing specialized ammunition), Laser rifles, Light assault guns, squad
support weapons, and of course man-portable fusion guns.  In some cases,
you have to settle for hitting limbs, but in GURPS this will disable people
rather effectively.

It seems to me that a lot of people here are latching onto one bad design
to slam GT  because they don\'t like the idea of a new system for Traveller,
especially one they clearly don\'t understand.  If for some reason people
don\'t like GT, that\'s fine, but I for one am tired of being treated like a
second-class citizen because I do.  Warts and all, GURPS is a damn sight
better vehicle for Traveller than some versions GDW put out (TNE for one
major example).  Compared to the violence TNE did to the basic spirit of
Traveller, nothing GT has done is even worth mentioning.  
(I imagine that\'s a whole \'nother flame war waiting to happen, but I\'m
going on vacation for a week.  Save the napalm until I get back.)

Cultures evolve following the rules of Lamarkian evolution, not Darwinian 
evolution.  And yes, \'lesser species\' *do* have cultures.  Just watch some 
tapes of coyotes or elk sometime.  They may not be very culturally evolved, 
mind you, but they have a culture.

Mass extinctions occur when a niche is closed, or a better niche filler 
appears.  If your species is a \'one-trick pony\', its days are numbered.

Ah, but life creates the capacity for more life.  Check out the ecology of a 
rain forest sometime, as compared to a sand desert.

Pshaw! It\'s well known that animals in a sand desert naturally evolve the
ability to bend light around them so that they are completely invisible.
This also helps to protect them from cooking in the hot sun.

Just because you can\'t *see* the teeming life in the desert doesn\'t mean
they\'re not there. I know.

It does in fact sound egocentric, answers a lot of questions, but begs the

My gripe, and that of some others was ORIGINALLY (not a yell, a accent on
the word) that not only was it a supersuit, but IM\'s are not allowed to be
seen without it, and you couldn\'t generate a given IM character without
devoting (even minimal) skills to it.  The supersuit started to snowball
from that...

Actually, you\'ve pretty much had a gripe with just about anything you don\'t
agree with. Going over your posts to the list on the subject of Impie
marines and GURPS in general seems to give me the impression that you\'re
actively attempting to foment outrage over Doug\'s idea of the Impie marines
by whatever means necessary: overstatement of the claims of the people
you\'re debating with, vague insults, appeals to the list for support,
theatrical sniping at your opponents in posts to agreeing third parties and
so on.

So, what is it? Are you looking to start a "Doug\'s marines are stupid, my
marines are ultra-cool" flamewar, or a GT vs. CT flamewar, or are you simply
just inclined towards harping on things that you disagree with?

I lived in the New Mexico & Arizona deserts for about 8 months.  I\'m well 
aware of the diversity of the ecology.  I *also* spent about 3 1/2 years in a 
rain forest, and I\'m aware of how much *more* diverse it is compared to the 
desert ecology.  There\'s a lot more niches in a rain forest.

Civil War as having been sporadic fighting and a bunch of coups.  This was
basically what I was thinking too.

What this suggests to me is that M:600 is kind of like M:1100 at a lower
tech level, with more psionics (it\'s before the suppressions), and at least
sporadically a bit less law and order (when the Fleet\'s away, the pirates
play...).  

It probably would feature a bit more bickering between noble
factions, with cliques busily denouncing each other to whichever warlord is
dominant at the time, and sometimes dropping their Huscarles (or borrowed
Marines!) on each other, in a way they couldn\'t usually do in
(non-Rebellion) M:1100.  

It could also have the odd Naval fleet entering the picture, repairing
itself, or fighting a rival fleet, then leaving again - a kind of
convenient war that goes away when the referee wants it to.  It could also
be a good setting for Trillion Credit Squadron, although the fleets would
tend to use the same ships.  

The noble decapitation strikes would be a good excuse for Striker games
too, incidentally.  You could capture whole worlds with a single regiment
of Marines/Huscarles, and your Huscarles could possibly get to prove that
those I\'renes aren\'t quite as good as they think they are...

All this just seems to make it a slightly higher chaos version of M:1100
though.  I\'m not quite sure there\'s enough difference to make it worth
playing it rather than the \'easy\' option of M:1100.  But that possibility
of kicking the Marines around does have some appeal...

I\'m going to keep working on it though, just to keep my brain occupied. 
I\'m working on some notes on the Emperors List, trying to work out who
these weenies are.

I will pay cash money for you to show me where anybody said that Marines
were "never seen" without Battledress.  We\'ve been saying that it\'s the
combat uniform.  I can show you at least five posts where I mention other
uniforms for different duties.

As I\'ve pointed out (repeatedly), to force a CT player to devote an
equivilant amount of skill to Battledress that a GT Marine devotes would
require that the Marine spend have two skill levels out of 98 others.  The
required expenditure is only 1.4% of the total!

I ask for feedback for constructive criticism, not constant harping on the
fact that GT isn\'t CT, a game that\'s been out of print for over a decade.

You say that GT Battledress is too tough, I ask (over and over again) if
you\'d trust a bullet proof vest that fails one time in ten.  Well?

Problem is, Bruce, that he\'s liable to get lost in the shuffle.  Can\'t we just
call him Bruce?  It would make things a *LOT* easier.

If you\'re gripping about Doug Berry\'s views on Imperial Marines, you need
to recognize that he doesn\'t even have a contract to write the book yet. 
His proposal is one man\'s opinion, not GT canon.  And it\'s clear that
people are misunderstanding what he\'s proposed, either because they didn\'t
read them properly or don\'t understand GURPS.

I was bored around 0200 this morning, so I decided to clean up some of my 
mailboxes.  I got carried away...  Around 17 hours later I have a bit 
over 157 MB of uncompressed TML Digests, neatly sorted by volume and 
issue, on my Mac\'s hard disk.

1994 - 148 digests - 2.7 MB
1995 - 383 digests - 7.6 MB
1996 - 971 digests - 27.7 MB
1997 - 1,419 digests - 47.1 MB
1998 - 1,416 digests - 45.6 MB
1999 - 830 digests - 26.2 MB (so far)

During my cleaning, I discovered that I was missing a few digests, and 
also that one seemed truncated.  I have checked ftp.mpgn.com and their 
archives show the same thing, so I don\'t think it\'s Emailer gobbling up 
files.

The volume.issue of the digests in question are as follows:

- ----
1994.1 - missing (suspect that it never existed)

1996.680? - there was about half-a-week (19960304..19960308) during which 
I received no digests as we transitioned to the new list server.  The 
last message I got from the old server was in digest 679 and was dated 
Sat, 4 May 1996 15:49:09 -0500 (CDT).  Did any digests beyond 679 emanate 
from the old server?

1996.60..69 - missing (from the new server)
1997.843 - contents but no body (truncated)
1997.2125..2127 - missing
1997.2140..2141 - missing
1998.173 - missing
1998.202 - missing
- ----

If anybody has a copy of any of the above digests, I\'d really appreciate 
you forwarding them on.

Once I have all the missing pieces, I\'m going to run a few filters over 
the lot and clean out any garbage, like requests to unsubscribe, bounced 
mail messages, autoresponders, gratuitous headers and footers, and 
so-forth.  I reckon I can get the whole lot, the last five years, down to 
less than 65 MB (compressed).  Anyone got 65 MB of space free on a 
Traveller-centric FTP site with big pipes?

Anyway, once I\'ve got a cleaned up and uniformly formatted master 
archive, I plan on doing two things:

1)  Creating a "Top 100 Threads" sub-archive which, not surprisingly, 
will contain the Top 100 Threads.  I figure the most interesting threads 
will run for the longest time, and generate the largest numbers of 
messages, so I plan on simply working out which threads generated the 
largest numbers of messages and using those.  If you have a better 
suggestion, let me know.

2)  Just for the heck of it, I\'m going to crunch a rough word count for 
every single person who\'s ever posted a message to the list.  From that 
I\'ll extract a "Top 100 Writers" list which I will, naturally, post back 
to the TML.  Apart from letting you gauge how much time you\'ve spent 
writing messages, I don\'t know what use such a list would be, but hey, 
that\'s what a Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister is for, right?

If anyone wants any specific information sucked out of the archive, now 
would be a good time to speak up - before the adrenaline runs out.

Oh, and if I happen to be reproducing the work of someone else, please 
*don\'t* tell me - I\'m currently in such a good mood that the last thing I 
need to hear is that I\'ve just wasted a day of my life.

Take it easy.

Henry.

That is ridiculous and insulting, from someone who wants to write a
playable, viable and marketable supplement. All of the material you present
must support balanced, interesting campaigns, or you are wasting people\'s
time and money. Sure, every person who reads it will find something not to
like. When you receive this much opposition, though, and your only recourse
seems to be "because that\'s the way I like it", doesn\'t that tell you
something?

Go back and re-read the wishlist from SJ Games:

"The author of this book should be familiar not only with GURPS Traveller,
but also the *original* Classic Traveller source material." [emphasis in
the original]

This says to me you *do* have an obligation to simulate CT as best you can,
under GURPS.

[That also, by the way, is the reason that CT takes precedence over other
versions for GT authors -- because that\'s the way SJ Games wants it. This
presumably also reflects their licensing agreement with Mr. Miller.]

Agreed, but irrelevant: you know as well as I do, in the real world
designers rarely ask for your opinion, let alone allow the dogface to
design his own suit in isolation, with an unlimited budget of cash, weight,
volume, and maintenance support.

There is a fundamental flaw in this logic, and it stems from confusing a
game mechanic (the GURPS Vehicles design system) with its in-game result.

GURPS Vehicles is a meta-system -- a system for setting up a vehicle design
system. It *has* to be, to cover even just the worlds and technologies that
are represented by published GURPS sourcebooks, let alone whatever else
could be dreamed up. In order to apply it to a particular setting, the
author or GM has to first decide what is applicable to his setting. "The
rules are there, so I\'m going to use them" might be an acceptable argument
for something like HG, which exists only within a particular setting
(though I personally find that sort of munchkinism repulsive), but cannot
be naively applied to GURPS Vehicles without breaking the system. 

No one would argue that GT should be able to use force fields and
deflectors, simply because they are included in GURPS Vehicles. High-TL
advanced laminate armor or armor above a certain DR for battlesuits may
well be equally suspect *in the GT setting*. The point is that the author
must make deliberate choices that reflect the setting he is trying to
present. It is this point that the designer of the infamous Commando BD
either ignored or forgot.


Moreover, in the real world weapons systems are not the product of a single
genius with unlimited resources (which is to what a game master with all
the rules in front of him amounts), but rather a process of many hands,
many agendas, and many compromises. *Everything* is designed and built by
committee; *everything* is subject to Clauswitzian "friction" and "fog of
war". Take a look at the prototyping rules in the self-same GURPS Vehicles
(pp. 201-202) for just one example: how many iterations of find-the-flaw,
fix-the-flaw do you think your average bureaucracy will go through before
they decide a design is "good enough"?

Other factors influence weapons design, not the least of which is "cost
effectiveness". This is *not* defined by the steely-eyed killers who
actually have to use the bloody thing, but by the bean-counters who bought
it (and a million more like it). Every system, including weapons, has a
replacements, parts, and logistics stream that is invisible to the killers
- -- the "life-cycle costs" -- that will define what gets bought and what
does not. Those bean-counters will buy the system that provides the best
"bang for the buck"; incremental but expensive improvements in capability
will simply not make the cut, however nice they might be to have. 

This is not to say that the battlesuits issued to the Imperial Marines
won\'t be capable, or even the best available -- they will. But there are
plenty of *in-game* reasons why they will not be _overwhelmingly_ capable,
without ever having to invoke playability or game balance. 

To cite two examples:

(1) The M1 tank is indeed extremely capable. It is not invulnerable,
however: that lovely Chobham armor is only applied to the front slope. The
other five faces of the hull and turret are vulnerable to a wide variety of
weapons -- rather more than your acceptable 10% failure rate. The reason?
Weight and performance primarily, but also the realization that the frontal
armor protection is probably *good enough* to accomplish the mission
envisioned for the vehicle. [In battlesuits, even that frontal armor will
almost certainly be traded away for the ability to take cover and hide. So
a battlesuit that is as well-protected as the *side* armor on an M1 is
probably sufficient -- and "sufficient" is what gets bought.]

(2) Union soldiers in the American Civil War were issued obsolete
muzzle-loading rifles, despite the fact that reliable breach-loading
repeaters were available, and proved tactically decisive on more than one
occassion (cf. Wilson\'s Brigade at Chickamauga). The reason? The Ordnance
Department felt that soldiers equipped with repeaters would be prone to
waste ammunition (which was heavier and more costly anyway), and the
advantages did not outweigh the extra expense.


Having a vision of the desired result and being able to keep it clearly in
mind is absolutely necessary to writing a book-length supplement. Allowing
that vision to blind you to every other consideration -- especially the
avowed purpose of the book and its intended audience -- is a recipe for
disaster. I submit, Mr. Berry, that what you want to write is a *game*, one
that is supposed to be played and enjoyed, and one that is supposed to
reflect certain established parameters collectively called "canon", however
contradictory those parameters might be. It is not a treatise on all the
problems you saw as an infantryman and how you would fix them in a perfect
world.

The US military does.  Anyone here think a PASGT vest will stop rifle
rounds nine times out of ten at typical infantry combat ranges?  Probably
not.  You can, and probably should, apply the same logic to battledress. 
It should reduce or eliminate "nuisance" damage (the same way PASGT handles
pistol rounds and fragments) but direct fire from opposing infantry is
something you avoid or suppress.  IMO, the "original" BD in GT works like
this fairly well; but significant uparmoring will cause problems.

The point of a game is to be entertaining.  GT is not supposed to be a
military simulation, it\'s supposed to be an adventure game.  I submit that
if there\'s no risk, there\'s not a whole lot of adventure.  Battledress
should mot make firefights risk free because doing so would make the game
less fun.  

As an example, there has been a discussion on Pyramid about the appropriate
levels of armor for warships.  The consensus is that armor protection
should be deliberately constrained to avoid creating unstoppable
juggernauts.  The ability to exclude median damage from bay weapons at half
damage range was considered sufficient, with turrets having much less
armor.  This last was adopted specifically to replicate the High Guard
mechanic of having turrets vulnerable even in heavily armored designs.

Pretty much as I\'d though.  A slow lumbering ship with tons of armour so
it can get within range with its big guns.  I\'ve noticed there seems to be
(very) limmited fuel available for these ships.  Because of this Sword
World naval stratagy would prolly rely heavily on the use of tankers and
gas giants.  Primary mission in an invasion force would prolly be to
secure the gas giant(s) first. A strike mission would be to fire the
engines for a short burst, coast to the target, blow the heck out of said
target, change course, and get back to base before whats left blows you to
heck.  This fits well with the Sword Worlder psyche. ;-)

I found something you might be interested in, a web translator not unlike
the alta vista "babel fish", but can translate Norwegian and Icelandic!
Pluging in you ship names I discovered the raterh amusing translations.

I don\'t think you can fairly evaluate a series on one episode. I
remember the first time I tuned in to the X-Files, and happened to
catch the episode that most fans consider to be the worst episode
of the first season. It was a while before I went back to that series.

Comparisons to Star Trek are inevitable, given that they both take
place in outer space aboard a starship. This is just a new spin on
the Babylon 5 - Deep Space Nine debate, who was ripping off whom,
since they both took place on a space station...

Anyway, IMHO I think after only four episodes is a little premature 
to dismiss the series, especially if you haven\'t seen all four...

Hm, but did we ever settle on a handwave for that, other than \'game balance\'?

I suspect that we could downgrade battledress just by deciding that, in the
Traveller universe, bonded superdense (ie. \'expensive metal\' in GT terms)
is the best armour there is. This would make an acceptable reason for the
\'flaws\' in BD protection.

What\'s our handwave for lower turret armour?  Personally, I like the idea
of a maximum mass, with heavier turrets requiring more motors and suffering
\'to hit\' penalties, but I\'m not good enough with VE2 to muck that up on my
own.

Yeah, here\'s another case of where GT diverges from CT canon. I still think
GTL9 needs to be split into several tech levels (say early, middle, late)
to match the Traveller TL resolution. My own personal suggestion for
minimal GT modification was to create a \'late GTL9\' catagory, which had
much-improved thrusters (but still not quite as good as GTL10). I may end
up modifying GT Shipyard to do that anyway.

unacceptable? I have to disagree there.

The way I see it, BD is about enhancing infantry and making them capable of
carrying impressive weapons. Not about making them into tanks. If I built a
tank that could be killed 10% of the time by an infantryman\'s weapon, or
even the squad support weapon, I\'d be working for the French government
(Grin, duck). But an infantry battlesuit that\'s immune to just about all
small arms, artillery fragments (even in the C57 still probably the biggest
casualty source) and most support weapons, while maintaining and even
enhancing infantry mobility... that works for me.

While building a battlesuit that allows heroes to stand up to fusion guns
while toppling skyscrapers on one another might be fun, I just don\'t see it.
You might build a specialist assault suit with heavier armour, I suppose,
but what infantryman, in what era, is going to be trained to just stand
there in the open and blaze away? I believe that BD should be invincible
against standard infantry weapons like assault rifles and even ACRs. Against
more powerful weapons, the infantryman\'s best defence is still to use
stealth, suppressing fire, and ground cover - infantry tactics won\'t change
that much.

You want to be immune to battledress carried fusion guns? Ride a Trepida. Of
course, a Trepida can\'t do a lot of the things infantry can. But that\'s the
tradeoff.

A little info from the designers\' notes to March to Victory, first game of
the Great War series produced by GR/D (the guys who obtained the rights to
Europa from GDW and for whom I happen to be webmaster :) ):

"Although their [zeppelins] hydrogen gas mad them extremely vulnerable to
fire, it was surprisingly hard to set one on fire, even when incendiary
bullets were used (unless the incendiary hit a metal support strut, they
often passed completely through the balloon envelope without setting off a
spark)."

In MT, I assume that the forces involved are high tech?  If so, then I
imagine nearby explosions would be a problem, as would fire from laser,
plasma, and fusion weapons.  The danger caused by nearby explosions of AA
fire could perhaps be reduced with modern fire-resistant materials used for
the gas bladder (is that the correct term?).  If the forces are not high
tech, but are rather at the tech level where zeppelins represent
state-of-the-art, there might be other considerations for you to keep in
mind.  For one thing, Zeppelins were resistant to AA fire in part because
they tended to fly higher than the AA of the time fired.  Additionally,
while they were hard to shoot down, they were poor defensive platforms, with
huge blind spots for their defensive guns v. attacking fighters.  And of
course, don\'t forget that zeppelins often were blown off course.

The Imperial Marines will take up about a third of the book as I now have
it laid out.

The rest of the book will detail the army, with an emphasis on
non-traditional campaigns like playing engineers or medical staff.

One more time, if you don\'t like the way Battledress is presented in GURPS,
you are under no obligation to use it in any way, shape or form.  You could
easily run a M*A*S*H game where there was very little gunfire at all.

Now, about playability.

Everybody remember "Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium"?  Better
known as "Shattered Ships of the Fighting Imperium"?  Those designs are
broken.  Badly.  Many of the TNE designs were awful.  Just about anytime
there has been a published design for Traveller, somebody on this list has
said "I can do better than that."

I guarantee that if _Ground Forces_ gets published with a sub-par set of
armor in it, within two weeks someone on this very list will bitch about
how it\'s too weak.  And then post a corrected version.  I want to avoid
that by building the best possible suit for inclusion.

It\'s not going to be CT battledress.  I am *very* familiar with the source
material, as I\'ve been playing this game since 1977 and have an almost
complete collection of CT materials.  However, I have to write both for the
setting, and the game system.  If you think Traveller gearheads are bad,
you haven\'t seen anything until you\'ve seen GURPS grognards rip apart a
design.

The standard weapon of the Imperial Marines is the FGMP-12.  The armor has
to provide adequate defences against that class of weapon or it\'s useless.
The average damage of the FGMP-12 is 560 points, so the armor needs to be
in 600-800 range to be even considered.  There was a design posted last
night that achieved this level using thermal superconducting armor.  I\'m
giving that set a close look.

A description of airships (Dirigibles) and how to incorporate them into a CT 
campaign was presented in a Ships Locker article on page 6 of JTAS #2.  This 
might be a good place to start as far as a physical description of 
dirigibles in your MT campaign.

As far as combat, Airlords of the Ozarks presented a combat system for 
airships (including ultralights), but I found it somewhat clumsy to use.  A 
better system is actually available in GDW\'s Space:1889 game, as most ships 
were based on a helium/hydrogen lift design.  Extensive rules for detailed 
airship combat are available there.

Finally, the effect of atmosphere would have a strong influence on combat.  
In thin atmospheres, the actual amount of "lift" provided by helium or 
hydrogen would be far less than that obtained in a standard or dense 
atmosphere.  This would allow those pesky natives with the low tech weapons 
to actually cause significant damage to the crew compartment, or the bladder 
itself.

But if I do want to play Marines, it will have to be a very different
version from the past iterations of Traveller, it seems. Sorry, I won\'t buy
this. (Seriously, I won\'t.  If it\'s set up that way, I will not lay down my
money for it.) I can just barely accept one or two unplayable pages as in
StarMercs, but not a whole third of the book.

I guarantee that they will get shouted down by the same people who slammed
Commando armor as too heavy.  You cannot please everyone, so you have to
decide who to piss off.  Better it be the gearheads, since they\'ll never be
happy anyway and will at least get some pleasure out of deigning a better
suit.  The non-gearheads will throw up their hands in disgust and say "I
can\'t design anything more playable because I don\'t even own Vehicles and
don\'t want to."  Does GURPS really want to alienate this sector of the
market any more than it already has?

The book should not be written primarily for grognards and gearheads.  It
should be written for the average player (not the ones who read Pyramid and
TML).  They want fun, not a military simulation.  To the extent that GT
becomes a simulation rather than an adventure game, it is a bad product,
and I\'ll fight it.  I don\'t think I\'ll be alone.  If the gearheads decide
they can do better, let them.  But not in the official universe. 
Playability should overrule everything else in published material.  If you
can\'t write the book with this in mind, you shouldn\'t write it at all.  If
you can\'t write it with respect to the source material, you shouldn\'t write
it.

Just to give some perspective, I\'ve done several designs for GT: Imperial
Navy. Those designs are not the absolute best that could be extracted from
the rules system by bending it unmercifully.  They are the most interesting
that I could make using the rules as a guide, and conforming to the
descriptions in CT or MT.  Where I could build a more capable ship without
violating the spirit of the design, I did, but I also designed ships that
were weaker than they absolutely had to be.

Why?  Does modern body armor provide adequate protection against a 5.56mm
rifle round?  No.  Name an era in history when the standard individual
armor was sufficient to exclude 90% of shots from the standard individual
weapons of the day (since this seems to be your standard for "adequate"). 
I can\'t think of one.

Since the Zhodani are the most typical threat force in most Trav games, I\'d
use them as my benchmark.  I\'d assume that the FGMP-11 (the standard Zho
squad heavy weapon) has been engineered to reliably defeat existing
Imperial Marine battledress (i.e. at least 50% of the time) and backdesign
the armor from that assumption. That gives you a protection level of around
DR500 including superconducting layer, which is close to the existing GT
TL11 battledress.  Even this confers too much protection against the
standard Zho individual weapon, the PGMP-10.  Assault dress, issued only to
a very few units, could be a bit more butch (say DR600) but that\'s the
absolute max.  

Just so you know: If you do write this book and include an overpowered
supersuit with bad play balance characteristics just because it\'s
technically feasible, I will be on the playtest complaining about it
loudly. If the book goes to print without playtesting the hardware, I will
be here on TML telling people not to buy it. Consider this fair warning.

I forget, because I wasn\'t in a position to contribute, just read the
results.  I\'d be more than happy to settle on some sort of manufacturing
technology limitations (can\'t make hyperdense armor plate thicker than x
cm, for example)  This worked for real-world battleships in the 20th
century.

Too late for that, because GT main book battle dress uses advanced laminate
armor.  However, you could rule that TL10-12 advanced laminate and
composite are only available with DR x (maybe 300 or TL*3) because of
manufacturing difficulties or some such.  This would explain why warships
don\'t often use these armors, even though it might be worthwhile. I could
save a lot of weight by switching to composite in a heavy cruiser and the
cost isn\'t that bad, but I don\'t think the result makes much sense or much
fun, so I don\'t do it.

That works pretty well. Imperial Bureaucracy was another good option. 
Personally, I don\'t care much. "Because it\'s more fun that way" as usually
good enough for CT, why shouldn\'t it work for GT too? 
 
As for Ve2, GT ship design uses only a subset of Ve2 rules anyway. (no
forcefields, hyperdrives, or cyberlinks, for example)  I don\'t see the need
to make an appeal to Ve2 for every design decision.

Its pretty clear that the advanced armors were mostly intended for battlesuits
and the like.  One reasonable limit is maximum armor is a flat cost/sf -- say,
$2000/sf (caps TL 12 advance laminate at DR 1,333, TL 12 advanced metal at DR
4,000, TL 12 expensive metal at DR 8,333, TL 12 standard metal at DR 16,666, TL
12 cheap metal at DR 40,000).  If you want to be a bit more flexible, halve
this limit, and then you can exceed it -- but multiply armor costs by the ratio
by which you exceed that limit.

I don\'t see that.  The obvious application of laminate is in armored
vehicles to model things like Chobbham.

That\'s an odd result: cheap armors can provide more total protection than
expensive ones.  I don\'t think I like it much.  It\'s easier to just put a
cap on DR for certain armor types, as was done with thermal superconductor
coatings.

I said \'advanced\', not \'laminate\'.  Chobham is standard or expensive laminate armor, _not_ advanced laminate armor.

No, it isn\'t an odd result.  If you look at real life armored vehicles, the
bigger it is, the lower the grade of armor in it.  A battleship has nowhere
near the armor quality of a tank, and high-grade body armor inserts are better
than the armor used in a tank.  The fact is, maintaining consistent high
quality is more difficult (in a nonlinear manner) the larger an object
is.  Creating an unflawed 20 carat gem is not twice as hard as creating
an unflawed 10 carat gem.

I\'m not sure what (or whether) the authors of GT: Imperial Navy will say in
the end, but I believe we left it pretty much as described in my previous
post: the level of armor in the guidelines is that determined by the
"Imperial Naval Design Board" or whatever to be "good enough". Anything
heavier is "too expensive" or "not cost effective", and won\'t be
considered; anything lighter is "inadequate for this class". [For those who
weren\'t party to this discussion, the ranges are broad and adjusted for TL.]

Note that this is easier to do in naval architecture than in vehicle
design, because there are several levels of protection available. One can
have "light" cruisers with minimal armor for the class and "heavy" cruisers
that are battleships in all but name.

My notes are packed for moving right now, but I think we\'ve done away with
laminate or ablative armor for starships as well. Advanced metal armor is
still kosher (so far), to leave some room for improvement over standard
(i.e., \'expensive metal\') hull armor.

GURPS Vehicles doesn\'t explicitly address drive motors as a fuction of
turret mass. I believe this is mostly to avoid another interative design
step, but it is also a product of the zero-volume armor that VE2 uses.
Turrets aren\'t rated for traverse speed anyway, so there would be no game
effect. 

If pressed, I will probably use this handwave -- if nothing else, it
prevents abuse of simplifications in the design system. As it stands,
turrets with the maximum amount of armor allowed in the guidelines can have
up to 20 stons of armor (500 lb/sf), which should be plenty.

Henry, you may be one sick puppy who really needs to get a life.  On the
other hand, you are proposing a potentially very useful service. 
Certain issues do arise repeatedly on the list, and a thread archive
could help us avoid repeating ourselves to excess.  I look forward to
your results.

It depends on the density of your material.  In general, 1 inch is 5 lb/sf
* density.  DR 800 advanced TL 12 laminate is 12 lb/sf, so assuming density
15 (superdense, even though that\'s not all that dense) 1 inch is 75 lb/sf,
and DR 800 is 0.16 inches (0.4 cm).  Much of the reason VE2 ignores armor
volume is that it is generally irrelevant.

Fortunately, there\'s almost _no_ references to ablative armor in
already-published material, so doing away with it can be done with minimal
violence to published material.  By and large laminate armor is too expensive
for a viable spacecraft in any case -- though \'composite\' armor is tempting,
since at the same armor protection level it is actually _cheaper_ than metal.

I must have imagined your posts to the lists where your view of the marines
differed from Doug\'s views and various bits of source material. I also must
have imagined the post in which you spoke for the "silent majority" of CT
players (who had not weighed in on either side of the discussion) who would
rather see Imperial marines as they existed in YTU.

My apologies then.

Subsector or Planetary Naval Infantry probably have  TL 12 Combat Armor

Imperial Army units, depending on their function and TL they are outfitted

- - Combat Environment Suits
- - Combat Armor (TL of introduction to 15)
- - Battle Dress (TL of introduction to 15)

Planetary units would range from homespun/leather to TL 12-14 Battledress

In both T4 & CT it seems that the Imperium has learned that the Droyne are
the descendants of the Ancients and at least the general gist of the story

I was wondering when did Imperial researchers learn this?
Is this generally accepted in the Imperium or only regarded as a theory?
Would this be in standard library data available to the general public or
more closely guarded?

In most of my games people research data on the Ancients isn\'t widely

I would think this being common knowledge would cause most Droyne homeworlds

I can\'t say for CT other than if you look at most of the Droyne 
worlds, they are interdicted.  This would usually stop most 
exploitation.

However, in M0 (T4), the information is being suppressed.  Emperor 
Cleon I wants the Ancients to be Human, hence the Archon Theory.  
Of course, savvy PCs will quickly discover the cover up once they 
have found an Archon (Ancient) site; the seats are all wrong for 
humans but just perfect for Droyne.  Going public with the 
information is certainly going to bring unwanted attention and 
possibly a blown reputation if they persist in their "heretical 
preachings."  

IMTU, the term "Ancients" hasn\'t been invented. The characters use 
the term "Archons" and get a tongue lashing if they use Ancients.  
NPCs all of a sudden start listening and badgering the PCs about 
this new race called the Ancients, etc.  Makes things difficult for 
them.  Thus, they now stick to Archon ...

I figure it thus (and probably incorrectly):

1 inch hard steel = DR 70.
800 DR = 11.429 inches hard steel.
11.429 inches x armor modifier = actual thickness of 800 DR of material.

But then I\'m barely legal as a gearhead.

    'body' => 'Some random thoughts on the battledress issue:

First, let me preface this by saying I have not read, nor do I own GT, so I 
cannot intelligently comment on any design aspects of GT BD.  What I can do 
is relate my RPG experiences and real life military experience and how they 
relate to BD issues.

First, Doug is right.  If you don\'t like his idea for the GT BD, then don\'t 
use it.  An early issue of JTAS (I will have to look up the reference and 
post it, as I do not have my Traveller library in front of me right now), 
has an entire article on battledress and it\'s use by Imperial troops.  This 
adaptation has served my campaign quite well for 20 years now, and should 
work for most CT and MT campaigns.

As far as IM\'s never being seen without BD?  I would think that the use of 
BD is probably mission dependent.  Sure, if I was going into combat, I would 
want the best suit money could buy (or the lowest bidder in this case), and 
I would want my troops in it at all times, especially in a combat zone or 
other hostile environment.  Does the IM unit guarding the Emperor\'s private 
vineyard on a backwater agricultural world warrant BD?  Probably not.  Even 
in "hostile" environments, the IM unit doesn\'t always appear in BD.  An 
article in Travellers Digest by DGP (again I\'ll have to post the reference 
later), describes the occupation forces of Terra, including the IM unit 
stationed there.  In order to establish a more friendly approach to the 
native population, the troops there are rarely seen in BD. Due to cost, it 
is probably more likely that only elite units (Force Recon comes to mind) 
and assault troops would be BD equipped.

The next point I would like to address is the myth of "unstoppable" BD.  
There is no such thing, all weapon or defense systems can be overcome by 
something.  Sure, six PC\'s in BD are probably more than a match for 300 TL6 
equipped regular army troops. Tech level difference is a powerful tool, and 
those that have the tech will use it. Evidence can be seen in the US 
government\'s use of the Gatling gun on Native Americans, or the British Army 
use of the Maxim machinegun in Africa. The use of superior technology can 
easily result in the slaughter of lesser equipped troops. Suppose those 
natives had additional support weapons though.  Being an ex-groundpounder 
myself, when faced with overwhelming firepower there are basically four 
things to do:

1) Call in an airstrike
2) Call in the Field Artillery
3) Run like Hell
4) All of the above

(Doug can probably back me up on this, although I don\'t think it is in any 
field manual.)

Support weapons can generally make a huge difference on whether your 
infantry unit survives, and whether or not the enemy takes casualties.

Suppose we take those same six PC\'s and pit them against a fireteam 
performing a general security sweep.  The fireteam consists of six 
individuals armed and armored to the same standards as the PC\'s.  Would each 
sides BD be effective?  Probably.  Would each sides weapons be just as 
effective? Probably.  Would the outcome be a bloody standoff with both sides 
taking casualties? No.  The difference would be in the training, morale, 
tactics, leadership, and about a thousand other factors that affect combat. 
Better training equals less of a chance of getting shot.

What all this boils down to is this:  At lower tech levels, a force with 
numerical superiority can probably take down a trooper in BD with an 
appropriate amount of heavy weapons support.  At higher levels, BD can be 
taken out by troops with better training and tactics.

Finally, is all BD psionically shielded?  A psionic character could easily 
wreak havoc on an unshielded character in BD.

The connection between the Droyne and the Ancients is made in the early
1100s (i.e., CT era).  (See Adenture 3?: Twilight\'s Peak; and Adventure
4?:  Secret of the Ancients ("?" because I\'m too lazy to look up which
Adventures they are).)  It becomes disseminated through the Imperium by
the MT era.  

T4 was set 1100 years earlier (Milieu: 0).  Humaniti has not yet learned
that the Droyne are actually one race scattered across many star
systems.  It takes some analysis of the census to realize that they are
all the same species.  The truth about the chirpers doesn\'t become known
until the 1100s era adventures, either, as I recall.

From the MT Imperial Encyclopedia, Referee\'s section on the ancients:

"...[Grandfather explained] Who in the Imperium today [1116] knoew these
facts? No one knows them all, but there are a few scattered sophontologists
who have come to the conclusion that the Droyne are the modern-day descendents
of the Ancients, and they are somehow not as intelligent as the earlier race."
(p. 48)

There are some people who are coming to that conclusion, and unless your PC\'s
are run through the \'Secrets of the Ancients\' adventure, that\'s all _anyone_
knows. Note, the section says that equating the Drtoyne with the Ancients is
just starting to become known.

You know, Eris, it doesn\'t feel like _any_ version, per se. The background\'s
clearly Traveller; but we\'re never exposed to the mechanics of the game, and
absent that, since it\'s not in the OTU, it feels mostly like this alternate
universe I visit several times a week. It\'s fun, you tell me what happens in
front of me, and I tell you (and the other players) what my character does in
response. 

Traveller versions, if you are not using the official background, are more in
the roll playing than the role playing and so far (for me, at least) I haven\'t
touched a die or cracked a rulebook yet.

I\'m not thinking \'This is Traveller\', I\'m thinking \'Crikey, we\'re here in a
new system three weeks and we\'ve tangled with the secret police and the Navy,
and had to help them shoot up our own ship! How in the heck are we going to

Let\'s try this again...shall we?  Sorry about sending blank message 
before...I\'m mouse impaired

As Glenn points out, the 1100 adventures are pretty much the first 
indication that the Ancients and the Droyne are one in the same.  Actual 
discovery of the post-war Droyne occurred during the First Imperium by the 
Vilani (if you look at the map on the back cover of Traveller Alien Module 
5, you will notice that most Droyne settlements are in the Spinward Marches 
Sector and farther, an area the Vilani did not actively explore).  On page 7 
of Traveller Alien Module 5, GDW points out that the Vilani Imperium and the 
Rule of Man were both too busy with other concerns to consider the Droyne 
anything more than a minor race.

When the Imperium came to power, expansion into the Spinward Marches began 
in approximately 300, with the sector coming under Imperial control by mid 
700 (page 7, Traveller Alien Module 5).  Again, discovery of the Droyne was 
dismissed as contact with another minor race.  This changed when the Droyne 
discovery of jump drive was found to predate the Imperium and sparked a new 
wave of research.

Over the course of the next 400 years, the amount of research done by 
Imperial researchers, as well as the discovery of Twilight\'s Peak, and the 
site at Antiquity/Corridor would be enough to link the Droyne with the 
Ancients.

As Glenn stated, who knows these facts?  Using the MT reference from the 
Imperial Encyclopedia..."no one knows them all", implying that the 
Droyne-Ancient connection is not a well known fact.  This is also restated 
in Traveller Alien Module 5, page 44; "The secret of the Ancients is a 
historical puzzle.  The few facts available are not sufficient to support 
accurate theories, and the Ancients themselves left no history behind." 
Thus, implying once more, that even the wisest minds in the Imperium don\'t 
have all the facts necessary to make a 100% accurate guess that the Droyne 
and the Ancients are one in the same.

As far as treasure hunters on Droyne worlds...most (if not all) Droyne 
worlds in Imperial space are interdicted.  Arguing with an interdiction task 
force does not make you rich...nuff said

If someone could prove to me that they made wearable body armour that
would stop a 5.56 NATO rifle round 90% of the time at standard
engagement ranges, not only would I buy the armour, I\'d sell my soul to
the devil to get the license to market the stuff to the military.

Ditto a tank that survived 90% of shots from all aspects; a missile
countermeasure device for an aircraft that foxed 90% of all missiles
fired at it; and a torpedo decoy or hard-kill measure that was 90%
effective against all modern torpedoes.

In combat, armour is very much down the list...

1. Don\'t get detected.
2. If you must be detected, don\'t get localised.
3. If you must be localised, don\'t be shot at.
4. If you must be shot at, don\'t be hit.
5. If you must be hit, don\'t be damaged.
6. If you must be damaged, don\'t be destroyed.

As you can see, armour helps in cases (5) and (6).

Because, for all ship\'s weapon systems save the meson gun, there is
necessarily a hole in the armour through which the weapon fires. This
makes the armour weaker in general; and also gives you the chance to hit
the unarmoured gap.

The "Armour" Doug & others are talking about often includes sensors, 
ECM/ECCM, point defense, often integral flight capabilities.
The superior sensors and electronics will help with 1, 2 and 4, 
the point defense will help with 4, and the flight will help with
2 and perhaps 4 (higher mobility may help you prevent localization
and even hits, but may make you easier to detect).

The FGMP is to prevent 3, by burning a big hole in whatever is 
trying to shoot at you. 

They\'re talking about an integrated system here, not just the metal 
plating. Granted, the metal plating is nasty enough, even after
Doug\'s alignment of defense ratings with expected energy weapon
damager ratings.

This is where the main problem seems to arise: just what should be required
to defeat battledress.  CT established that BD is vulnerable to a fairly
wide range of  personal weapons.  GT is supposed to parallel CT as much as
practical. (This is the guidance being given to GT writers.)  Therefore
Doug\'s statement that his proposed Imperial Marine BD is not CT-style BD is
an immediate red flag.  His suggestion that Imperial Marine BD should be
90% immune to an FGMP-15 (-12 in GT) is a major change that runs contrary
to established cannon.  Now, GT need not follow CT slavishly (it\'s hard to
make worthwhile BD that is still vulnerable to GT\'s version of shaped
charge snub pistol rounds, for example) but it should not deliberately
discard CT canon altogether without a sound roleplaying rationales.  

Changes of this nature should only be made if they enhance the roleplaying
experience.  There\'s no clear indication that it would make the game more
fun to play.  In fact, the more powerful BD is, the more contortions a
referee must make to fit it into a conventional roleplaying setting. 
That\'s not a god thing.

What about that "active" armor the U.S. Army was experimenting with? 
The stuff on tank hulls that was actually shape charges designed to
detonate against hostile fire?  To my understanding this would be really
stupid (unless I am missing something here).  Don\'t tanks typically use
infantry in a localized support role?  So if I wanted to kill a bunch of
U.S. soldiers, I\'d aim at the tank\'s active armor and watch it wipe out

If this question is stupid, then forgive me.  I live a sheltered life.

This is reactive armor, which is actually in use in a number of countries.  It
isn\'t a very big blast, and is fairly difficult to set off, and infantry are
unlikely to be within the dangerous blast zone (a couple of yards far as I
know).

volume is that it is generally irrelevant.

I think we have found the problem, people.

In FFS2, 0.4 cm of TL15 bonded superdense has an armour factor of about 16.

AF 16 will stop about 500 kJ of plasma bolt (but it gets messy from then on
in, due to the 40*sqrt(output) damage formula), or about 9 MJs of lasers.

CR Hensley (hensley.cr@worldnet.att.net or
http://home.att.net/~hensley.cr/Traveller/) has designed a 10mm ETC
machinegun at tech 10 that does damage 21. I think the original FS Heavy
Rifle had damage in this range as well.

In short, in FFS2, AF16 is pretty wimpy.

Now, in CT, battledress had problems under Striker as well - you could get
hurt by heavy machineguns, and cut in half by VFR Gauss Guns. Cluster
bomblets also gave you problems.

In conclusion, it seems armour has got a lot more effective under Gurps.

I always figured that since the Ancients re-invented most of the tech at
each site, things like chairs and such might not be readily recognizable.
Allot of sitting things like high tech beanbags that re-form to conform to
the individual user would minimize deductions about the Ancients anatomy.
Also didn\'t the Ancients try using human and other races for labor?  Allot
of furniture could be designed to fit these or a variety of such folk.

Reactive armor, blocks of explosive placed on the tank to prevent the
plasma jet of a HEAT round from forming.

It\'s not dangerous to exposed troops near the vehicle, since there\'s no
fragmentation and the actual explosion is fairly small.

Ok, I didn\'t know this.  When I first heard about it (from a friend in
the army) he said it was classified.  (this was a number of years ago).

Really?  The Soviets and Israelis have had the stuff for almost a quarter
century, IIRC.

The US Army never made much use of it, but the USMC used on their old
M-60A3 tanks before they got the M1s which don\'t really need the reactive
stuff.

Ah.  I was wondering when we\'d get to gearhead bashing.

There is a very usable set of Battledress in the GURPS: Traveller book that
can be used as a "basic" set.  What I am talking about is the Marine
Assault Armor.

I just want to understand, you are saying that you want to run a military
campaign in a very technological setting, but you don\'t think that
well-designed equipment is important?

Thank you for the warning.  I could go to the other extreme and build a
suit that has a total DR of 100, and can be ripped apart by most any weapon
in traveller.  Of course, people will wonder *why* the Imperium would buy
something so sucky in the first place.

I look forward to reviewing you manuscript submission.  You are submitting
to write this, aren\'t you?

For the last time; GURPS mechanics are different than Traveller.  Building
a suit of armor with a DR of around 600 will allow the wearer to be killed
by military weapons, but out of necessity render him almost immune to most
civilian type firearms.

Part of the problem her is that CT didn\'t separate penetration from the
chance to hit.  It was a lumped together in a series of DMs.  MT was a bit
better, and if you recall, it made battledress all the more tougher.  The
Marine Assault BD in Traveller Journal #1(?) had an armor of 22, more than
enough to defeat the vast majority of weapons.

TNE armor was lower tech, and was vulnerable to things like 15mm AMRs
firing DS rounds.  Using FFS1 you could build TL15 battledress that
shrugged of most any weapon in the game.

I don\'t see where any of the proposed design features bend the system
"unmercifully", I\'m simply doing the best job I can to design a suit of
GTL-12 armor that allows the wearer to do the most damage while remaining
alive.

The medieval period before the crossbow.  Most battles between armored
knights were decided by who dropped from exhaustion first.  HarnMaster
models this period quite well.

We can make a suit today that will stop a 5.56 round.  But it\'s so heavy
and bulky that it\'s impractical.  Not so for the designers of Imperial
battledress, they can build a suit that is tough enough to withstand fusion
fire and powered so that the operator doesn\'t have to life the 5-600 lbs of
mass himself.

Good points, but the Imperium and Zhodani have been at their respective TLs
for at least 100 years ( the Imperium reaches TTL-15 during the Solomani
Rim War, I don\'t have a date for the Zhos reaching TTL-14).

I find it hard to believe that the armor wouldn\'t have been upgraded
sometime in the forty years since the end of the Fourth Frontier War, or
the ten years since the end of the Fifth.  Measure/Countermeasure, the old
story of military development.

I just love threats.

Has it occurred to you that the reason I\'m doing this, and suffering all
these slings and arrows, is so that the book works right the first time
through?  I\'ve gotten a couple of decent designs from people and will
collect them and post them here for comment.  I don\'t even have the bloody
assignment yet, and I\'m trying to gage reactions.

Sop far, it\'s been a few people *vehemently* opposed, a few people
extremely supportive, and the vast majority either lukewarm or silent on
the matter.

This is a decent amount of armor.. I\'ll play with some numbers tonight.
Average damage of 114d6 (or 6dx19) will penetrate.  Go as low as 6dx12 and
you *might* get a penetration, if you are lucky.

If I may be so bold, I\'d like to suggest a name for this weapon: The Hellwhip

Yep! And that\'s why I agree with you.  What a lot of people don\'t understand
about the GURPS system is that under most GURPS optional rules violence is
very reflective of reality.

That means if someone unloads a couple of dozen rounds at you and hit you
you\'re dead. That\'s why even in contemporary GURPS games people wear kevlar
and avoid firefights like the plague.  Most of the time the last thing you
want to do is get into a gun battle. If you have to you do it the way SWAT
teams or Delta Force does it. You use every advantage. Shoot first. Kill
every opfor member BEFORE they know they\'re being shot at.

If you use the optional bleeding rules then even if you survive the
wounding, and the shock, without medical attention you\'ll most probably die.
Not very superhero like. In fact some games I know dislike GURPS for just
that reason.  You\'re PC can actually DIE! Some 25 point NPC can take out
your 175 point character just because he cuts you with a $5 knife. It\'s too
much like reality for them.

Of course GURPS allows cinamagraphic rules where almost nothing can take out
your character. And all rules are optional. But I think that the closer to
RL effects you play as a result of violence the more you, as a PC, want the
edge. So that you can actually survive.

Just my thoughts on the subject.

Well, without a pod it has about 6 hours endurance (both power and life
support); I guess we can call that \'backup\'.

Oh...it has been left unresolved as far as I know, but GURPS APSHD ammunition
might be another GURPSism which you want to ban.  A 20mm electromagnetic
cannon (very short barrel, low power) does 6d*6(5) with APFSDSHD, and is only
9 lb plus another 8 lb for a 50 round magazine.  That\'s basically smaller than
a FGMP, and has slightly higher penetration (630 vs 560, on average, and not
affected by thermal-superconducting, and a much smaller visual signature,
though it has no blast effects).  If you drop APSHD ammunition (superdense
isn\'t any denser than uranium, should it have more penetration?) damage is
only 6d*6(3) for average 378 penetration, which is better balanced vs fusion
guns.

Despite my misguided comments to the contrary, I\'d really love it if
Imperial Marines were to wear the traditional "battle dress" of various
South American tribes.

Now, pay attention, it\'s *imperative* that you get this absolutely right!
One string is looped around. Another string is tied to this loop so as to
make a sort of harness. On one side, where the two strings are attached, you
need to add a hanging bit of cloth.

When it\'s done, you should have a sort of "thong" design, with a bit of
cloth to cover your naughty bits.

Now, tell me guys who were dressed like that carrying fusion guns *wouldn\'t*
scare you if they started climbing out of drop capsules!

Not gearhead bashing, but a plea for recognition that gearheads are a
minority, albeit a vocal one.  Most gamers in my experience don\'t have the
time or inclination.

This sees a change from before.  Marine assault armor is a specialized
piece of kit.  Most Marine BD will not be assault dress.  At least, that\'s
the implication form DGP, which isn\'t cannon, but should be respected where
possible.

Nice of you to put words in my mouth.  I think well-designed is important,
but real world gear has vulnerabilities.  And the canon material we have to
work with makes some very explicit assumptions about the capability of top
of the line battledress that you are discarding.  I think there are plenty
of reasons that the IM may use gear that\'s a bit less than perfect, form
bureaucratic inertia, to expense, to technological limits that don\'t
manifest in the Vehicles design sequence.

I didn\'t say you should, did I?  I think a modestly improved suit,
basically a TL12  version of the basic battledress in GT would be fine for
line infantry, with a heavied up version for the (very rare) assault dress.
 That strikes a balance between invulnerable and too vulnerable.

No, I\'m not, partially because I don\'t have time and partially because I\'m
really naval specialist rather than ground forces, although I do work with
the Marine Corps from time to time.  I thought hard about proposing to do
Imperial Navies and decided that I don\'t have the time.

But disregarding the spirit of the earlier work far too much in my mind.  I
think it\'s probably better to deliberately design systems with limitations,
because this makes for more interesting games.

Nice, although the longbow seems to have had some success.  And those
armored nights were rather the minority.  Most soldiers on the field in
those battles were rather less well armored.

Well, the Zhos have not upgraded significantly, as witness AR1, which gives
then the same equipment as Alien Module 4 for the most part. I think it\'s
very unfair on them to upgrade the Imperials significantly. Before you
comment on the unfairness of war, I simply mean that it reduces the
dramatic possibilities a lot to have then so totally outclassed.

Normally, I don\'t threaten, but you seemed so deadset against anyone who
might disagree with you that I got testy.  I apologize for the tone, but
the substance remains.  If standard imperial marine Battledress is 90%
immune to a GURPS FGMP-12, or anywhere close to it, then it\'s too powerful
and an indication that the supplement as a whole does too much simulation
and not enough drama.  

I certainly don\'t mean it personally.  I don\'t know you and I\'m sure you\'re
a nice guy, but I just think that this is the kind of thing that could do
real damage to GT as a game.  GURPS has a reputation for being too far into
the gearhead camp already, and it\'s alienating some potential players.  If
the purpose of GT is to attract non-GURPS players to GURPS, than it\'s not
good if the supplements play up the gearhead nature of the game too much.

Count me vehement.  But silent.  I\'m on travel for a while so I won\'t be
posting for a week or two.  Hopefully this will have passed by then.

I just want to thank all the TMLers who sacrificed their keyboards, in
order to teach me a valuable lesson:

First you read, then you re-read, _then_ you sip!

Otherwise, I would have had to replace this keyboard (scarcely a month
old).

Well, perhaps "suppressed" is the wrong word.  Current theory is 
that the Archons were Human.  It is politically correct to agree with 
this theory as it lends support for Cleon\'s push to re-establish the 
Imperium.  Any other theory is "professionally" unsound.  See Page

According to GURPS Basic, 3 sf x 1" of steel has DR 8 and 80 HP.

Now that is a non-gearhead answer for you.

  TL E-F BD in CT was fairly survivable at a Striker AV of 18 (5.0 cm of hard
steel equivalent, aka ~4mm of bonded superdense) - energy-weapon shoulder-arms,
and AT light support weapons would all reliably neutralize a suit; with an FGMP
having a Pen of 34 (~20cm/hard steel) and doing 16 dice CT-style "neutralize"
might be a weasel-phrase for "convert to super-heated goo".

  I\'m not sure that an HMG could hurt one, but 20mm AC\'s become a hassle at
about TL 8 - a 45mm ATG can do it at TL 5 (!).

  BD in CT might not be very cost-effective, but it was from invulnerable, 
and the latter consideration seems more important to me; if I wanted to be
able to design battlesuits and walkers in CT I\'d do up the necessary design
sequences a la Striker. Oh, wait, I did...

There are a couple of caveats to the idea that snub pistols MUST penetrate
battledress: they couldn\'t in STRIKER, and I don\'t think they could in
SNAPSHOT or AZHANTI HIGH LIGHTNING. I assume that STRIKER, SNAPSHOT and
AHL play a part in CT "canon" and they were used as the basis for
MegaTraveller combat (which also featured battledress that bounced snub
pistol rounds.) Of course, I have my own problems with the STRIKER/MT
penetration & armor values (I never could stomach the idea that cloth
armor could stop a heavy machinegun--a Ma Deuce vs. the heaviest Kevlar is
still no contest...

  IIRC the main issue with solid AP after actual density is the strength 
of the material - the stronger it is the longer the penetrator can be and
thus the higher the effective cross-sectional density. Apparently melting
temperatures of the materials involved can also be an issue, but that\'s not
really researchable in open source, AFAIK :(

  Thus, if superdense is _much_ tougher than steel or tungsten (and it is)
then it could be a superior AP ammo - which the same rules say it really
isn\'t. To complicate further, with superdense some of the advantages can
be ignored if you assume that both sides are using it, but GURPS appears
to further assume that bleeding edge materials technology is armour only
(which might be correct, anyway).

  At least having GURPS: Vehicles on the end of the shelf protects the 
covers of my G:T books :)

Different sources vary as to how much is known, but I would suspect that
in the general Imperium populace, the connection between the Ancients and
the Droyne has not been made -- or if it has, it\'s just one of several
theories that people talk about. Think of modern-day conspiracy theory as
a parallel example. Look how many different theories there are about the
assassination of JFK: Oswald was 
	a) a lone nut, 
	b) a CIA spook, 
	c) a KGB spook, 
	d) Elvis

Some other "Who are the Ancients?" theories that I have seen include
the Archons theory (Humaniti are the decendants of the Ancients), and
the Geonee theory (the Geonee *are* the Ancients). I\'m sure we here on
the TML can come up with a few more. Like, say, the Hivers were the
Ancients...

By the say, "Droyne & the Ancients" sounds like a good name for a rock
band, doesn\'t it?

Good God! I just cant wait for the gearheads to mull over this one!

"is it Super Dense or Bonded Laminates g string?"

PS. Serious bit here.

I support Bruce\'s work here. BD has been evolving since CT, and for the
people harking that the design is broken from cannon have missed the point:

1. Cannon has been evolving since day one, contradictions galore have
appeared in *approved* meterial, and sometimes the information supplied has
been laughable *COMPARED WITH TODAYS TECHNOLOGY*.

Case in point, T4 had cold fusion and battledress, which sooo broke cannon
(even though I worship Greg Porter as a god).

2. GT is based on CT, but CT is a flawed system that is 25 years old and is
no longer evolving. Things that made sense then can look ridiculous today.

3. I disagreed with the fact that all marines have BD, but it is a fact, as
stated by Loren. I however do not think my view should be the enforced view
in the TML. Discussed yes, flamed, definately. I thought of a way around
that (Navy supplying transport and logistics) This will be used in my
campaigns (even the stuff in the Star Mercs book is still usable, the
marine APC is in fact called that by the marines, the Navy calls it the
Marine Deployment Pinnace [MDP])

4. If you object to the worldview of Bruce (Doug) Berry, ignore it. Buy the
Book, burn the book if you must, but for god sake dont let Traveller die
another death (2 is enought, I will support inocent mistakes, but poor
production values NEVER, and SJG has never had bad production valies)

This may be flame bait. I want a Traveller that is relevent to me. People
like Bruce (Doug) are making an effort. CT is not (i wuld go back to MT
before CT, at least it had a skill use system).

And I\'m assuming you have been, while on your feet, totally impervious to
it?  I don\'t fully understand what century you were fighting in, are you

No I have never been fired upon, but I\'m sure no-one in this century, as a
foot soldier has had 90% protection from opposing infantry fire while only
wearing body armour.

Otherwise, what my real-life experiences and your fantasy (BD in a perfect

However, unless someone has posted in total agreeance with you, you have

Well, getting away from your Anime/comic concept, back to real life, I would
have no other choice as there is no such thing to my knowledge, that will
give me, as an infantry/assault trooper, 90% protection from enemy infantry
when I am on the ground in that capacity.

Right-oh, so now it\'s little gunfire or you must have BD?  Do IM\'s have
M*A*S*H Units, or is the IN still carrying that tradition for them, meaning
that players who don\'t want BD can\'t play IM\'s?

Everyone has some ruling or design they want changed, thought they could do
better with (and probably, correctly so) with most game rules and
supplements.  The average player doesn\'t care about background history,
politics, or internal government red-tape... they usually simply ask, "Why
didn\'t they do things this way?"  then produce excellent reasons for their
personally required changes.

The reason they are broken is perhaps because they were forced to be made
that way.  People behind the scenes chose components for reasons other than
them being the best for the application.  These were for whatever reason you
like... kick-backs, conflict of interests, cost cutting (yes, I know your
perfect universe doesn\'t suffer this problem, the marines get funding all
the time while military schools and hospitals undergo cutbacks, naval
maintenance suffer budget reductions, whatever).  But I felt that added a
touch of realism which made it just a little easier to suspend disbelief for
an evening of gaming.

When my players used to ask (especially new gamers), "Come on, withthis
technology, why would...?" all I had to answer was, "Well, it\'s usually left
in the hands of government bodies with reels of red tape..." and they would
nod and smile and reply, "Just like real life hey?  I understand THAT!"

Let them.  No skin of your nose.  You reckon they\'re not going to pick your
stuff apart anyway?  It\'s not even published, and many on this list are
doing that already.  Only your perfect suit isn\'t getting picked to pieces
because it\'s not perfect, but unrealistically too perfect.  Not to mention
the "IM\'s are deployed in certain combat situations without BD" which
started this thing in the first place, from many posters that you chose to
ignore.  Sad huh?

There\'s also the factor that in the attempt to "Chtorr-form" Earth, you
have to assume that the unseen aliens behind it have gathered specimens
and possibly even set up sample terran ecologies somewhere. Thus, they
can test organisms before introducing them on Earth. 

So when they "dump" an organism on Earth, they\'ve already determined
that it\'s going to be one that walks all over the local competition.

Oh that?  Sorry... but I\'m not trying to publish my views for payment, and
was referencing from past publications and taking into account that, for a
handful of posts for pro comic-strength armour and IM\'s always deployed in
BD (about 3-4 actual individuals at the time, but more like 2-3 from
memory), there were more posters saying IM\'s would also be trained to, and
actually go into combat without BD, and that the proposed BD was far to
tough to be fun.

As for the silent majority, I never spoke for them, but did get a few more
out of the woodworks (so to speak).  Therefore, "I don\'t have any marines."

Actually, I\'m sorry but, I must say that I discard many posts after they are
read or replied to and I have lost track of numbers due to the large amount
of postings on this thread.  Perhaps you have kept yours and would care to
look back on the figures of who posted for what aspect of the thread and get
real figures to use against me as this obviously worries you a great deal.
Remember, it would be the names of individuals to get this "survey" from,
not the actual number of posts.

Oh, for ghu\'s sake, this is a science fiction game. Just because it doesn\'t
currently occur in real life ...

sigh.

What if, maybe ... just maybe ... there existed a protective suit that was
capable of doing just that. I know, it\'s crazy. But what if ...?

Just for the record, I think the view of the Imperial Marines as "the back
of the hand you don\'t want a taste of" is logical and interesting -- even
playable. I really don\'t see the exact problem people are having with this
concept, except that it doesn\'t fit their own concept.

This material reflects Doug\'s vision because, well, Doug\'s writing this
material. Big surprise there. And it\'s not like he\'s some kind of hack,
making this up out of whole cloth. He\'s got a good grasp of things Traveller
(indeed, better than most), and if he is taking a bit of creative license
with the bits and pieces of material that have been published over the
years -- well, that\'s the benefit of being the *writer*. It\'s the same
benefit enjoyed by most, nay, dare I say *all* creative writers who have
worked on Traveller material in the past.

Sure, this material doesn\'t goose-step in line with every single bit of past
Traveller writing. But reasonably, what piece of writing does, or could?
It\'s all compromise.

I think Doug\'s view of the Imperial Marines is just as valid as any other I
have read on this list, and more coherent than most. I think that it\'s
complimentary to and an improvement on previously published Traveller
material about them. It\'s not really a canon-breaking bombshell <giggle, I
made a funny> to have the Imperial Marines equipped with really
top-of-the-line, kick a**, high-tech equipment, is it?

And maybe, just maybe, there is more than one make and model of battledress
in the Imperium. Who knows, maybe two, three, four, or even several dozen.

Hey, it\'s not like Doug\'s even got the job yet. Maybe if we\'re lucky, SJG
will get Chris Foss to write it for them. <giggle>

"1 inch of unsloped hard steel armor = DR 70" (GURPS Vehicles 2nd edition,
pg. 4)

Ah HA!

;-P

BTW: I actually remembered incorrectly, at least above. Since the weight
modifier for hard steel is 0.5, the actual method I used is:

1 inch hard steel = DR 70.
800 DR = 11.429 inches hard steel.
11.429 inches x weight modifier x 2 = actual thickness of 800 DR of
material.

But I\'m a piker, and I\'m sure Anthony\'s right and I\'m not.

 The archives at ftp.mpgn.com hold most of 1996 forward, assuming you can

I understand, to some extent, where you\'re coming from. I bought CT back in
83 when I was an 11-12 year old who wanted to find out more about these
roleplaying games, having just read my first WD(52) and a Penguin book
\'explaining D&D\'. I\'d always been a SciFi person, something I came back to
after I read Tolkien/Eddings etc, probably cemented by the trip with my Dad
to see Star Wars in 77 at the age of six.

CT was the best RPG I had read/played at the time - characters with
careers, a spanning space background which resembled Norton, Azimov and to
an extent Star Wars. The game was good, although I found combat a little
slow. Then along came MT and its task system. This was superb; it\'s still
one of the best laid out RPGs, and was very playable (except automatic gun
combat until I got DGP\'s screen). The background was expanded, plausible
and gave the opportunity to take things in a slightly different direction.
Hard Times is possibly one of the best PG supplements ever. Out came TNE,
butchered the  Third Imperium\'s remnants, massively changed the rules, and
tinkered with the technology. I kept buying the books, but found myself
running games set around 1116/1117 under MT with the transition to the
Rebellion. Then GDW died, and I was sad. :-/

T4 arrived, laden with typos, and all the problems associated with a lack
of playtesting and proofreading. It felt like CT in style, but blended with
TNE and MT. I liked it, and with the T4.1 drafts that Marc put out it felt
as if it was going to go somewhere. The production style was atrocious, but
there were gems there (Milieu 0 Campaign, Pocket Empires, Imperial
Squadrons, Psionics Institutes and Alien Archive).

Imperium folded, bringing bad feelings across the Traveller community, then
SJG brought out GT. And very nice it is too. Production quality beyond TNE,
not quite as nice (IMO) as MT, but better illustrated. But I don\'t like
GURPS rule system (which feels very 80s, beyond CT, but behind MT/TNE/T4).
And appears to be some creep from the GURPS non-Traveller material to
Traveller. At the moment I find it hard to see past a non-task based system
to the background. I suspect that I can have a lot of fun with GURPS
Traveller. I\'ve bought the supplements - I think that Far Trader is
possibly one of the best Traveller supplements ever - and I\'ll carry on
doing so. I want GT to do well, but it doesn\'t feel right to me. I read the
books and I\'m not inspired to run GURPS, but think how I could use this
with T4. For now, I\'ll stay with T4.1/T5 draft and wait patiently for Marc
to issue T5.

However, I think that GT should be supported, and I\'m grateful that there
are people in BITS like Martin Dougherty and David Thomas who will take my
Traveller scenarios and add in the GURPS specific stuff. (I suppose *I*
should really, owning Space, and Basic, but I\'m lazy :-) )

I saw HT as the beginning of the end of the Imperium, setting things up for
the expansion of the most powerful remaining human empire, which would
slowly annex the rest of the empires remnants until the Solomani Sphere
became the Solomani oblong. I pictured Deneb and the Ziru Sirkaa surviving
as independent entities.

Interesting perspective. I\'ve seen many arguments here that M0 is to dark,
too nasty unlike good old shiny TNE. The game has a different feel (no
virus!) and I prefered it to TNE. It\'s darker (especially if you read stuff
like Joe Walsh\'s scenario in Missions of State) and has great opportunities
for politics/nobles/exploration and pirates<g>.

I always found a death by disintergration much more feasible than Virus.
But Virus was audacious..

The average IM wants the most invulnerable pieces of equipment and armor
that he can place his hands on when going into battle. Most often it won\'t
be invulnerable, certainly not able to withstand 90% hits against what is
normally fielded against him. The next best thing is to make the average IM
*feel* invulnerable, tempered by better training, morale and discipline than
his opponent. All things being equal, the unit with better training,
discipline, moral and tactical insight will prevail. Thus, I don\'t have a
problem with designing the best suit of GT BD the rules will allow. I do ask
though, whenever have you seen the military field the very best of what was
available at the time? It\'s always slightly behind and subject to a variety
of design compromises. Remember the debacle surrounding the design of the
M2/M3 (Bradley)? Bureaucracy is unavoidable.

What is needed is the *other* side of the BD equation and this so far has
only been hinted at with the medieval examples: weapons technology.

What drives the research to design a new set of armor? The perceived threat
of a new weapon. What drives the design of a new weapon? The perceived
advantages of a new armor, strategy or desire to remove the threat from the
IM on the ground.

Given that, accept the BD as designed. Accept that *many* varieties of BD
will probably exist, each slightly different and tailored to varied
missions. Doug should also accept that the IMC probably doesn\'t have the
money to purchase in decisive numbers the design of BD that the design
bureaus probably don\'t have the time to build/design.

Build a better weapon.

Make it cheap and easy to field. Why not design a smart mine? The US is
doing that now. Imagine a mine with passive sensors designed to detect and
track BD (even to differentiate between grossly different models). Now add
the capability of the mines in an area to share information and to
coordinate their attack). Give the mine a pop-up capability. Let it decide
to attack from above and behind. How many suits of BD are going to have a
DR600 on top or in back?

Design a better weapon.

The intelligent mine example is possible at CT TL8 (real world now), think
what you could do at TL10-12.

I haven\'t gone through the design sequence for anything like this yet, but
fail to see why it should be impossible.

Don\'t like 6x PCs in apparently unstoppable BD? Build a better weapon.

Sorry, Doug, but you\'ve made a calculation error. GURPS has a limit on
skill points [GURPS Basic, 3rd ed rev, pg. B43] (except where the setting
book redefines it, as in G:SO1 or G:Lensman): 2*age is maximum to be spent
on skills durign CGen. Rest goes to atts, advantages, etc
Some comparisons
Age	CT	MT	T4 [2]	GT	GT2pt%
18	0	0 [1]	4	=<36	~5.555
22	2-4	2-8	6-12	=<44	~4.545
26	3-7	3-15	7-20	=<52	~3.846
30	4-10	4-22	8-28	<=60	~3.333
34	5-13	5-29	9-36	=<68	~2.941

[1] not counting the 1-4 level 0 skills
[2] working from memory... my T4 books are misplaced.

So, assuming the maximum points rule is not rescinded, that two points is
about 5.555% for an 18yo just out of boot, and about 4.5% for a first
termer. (note, that, assuming maximum skills rolled under T4, Level one is
about 8_1/3% for a character having completed term 1.)

Snapshot & AHL are effectively the smae rules, except for movement (stiker
is in tabletop inches, AHL in squares).
Snapshot is a grid-movement system with CT Bk1 combat tables reformatted.

Mechanically, MT is striker merged with HG, and having a damage stat added
to the (largely identical) pen ratings. And with interrupts added. And, if
you have Ref\'s Companion, scaling rules for squad/platoon level and
company/Battalion level scales.

Invasion Earth is a Battalion/Regiment/Brigade level planetwide invasion of
Earth, at the close of the solomani rim war.

 All are labeled as "Traveller Game" and, except striker, a number.

That\'s what I\'m working with.  The trouble is there\'s next to no detail
about who they all are.  I kind of want to know *why* they would risk
everything to sit in a chair, however comfy, whose last 6 occupants have
ended up as grease-stains.

I think there were vaguely coherent factions, at least initially.  I
suspect there were \'Plankwellists\', Moot-supporters, moderates (like
Arbellatra), and of course bucketloads of pure and simple opportunists. 
I\'m trying to put the names we have into some kind of vague framework like
this.

BTW, that source you were using the other day - could it have been the
articles on IRIS in Challenge, around about issues 40-50?  I hated IRIS, so
I have never paid much attention to the articles, but there could have been
some mention of the Civil War in the history bits of the article.  I think
IRIS was set up after the Civil War, to make sure it didn\'t happen again. 
Was that what you were thinking about?

Anyway, I\'ve written a very nebulous outline for a generic Civil War
campaign, that could also work for the Rebellion:

Before \'Subsector X\' was integrated into the Imperium, it was dominated by
two Pocket Empires.  When it was absorbed, the ruling families of the PEs
remained the dominant nobles.  

The head of one family became the Subsector Duke, the head of the Imperial
bureaucracy, and dominant figure in the subsector\'s representation in the
Moot.  The subsector\'s Reserve fleet was also traditionally dominated by
this family.

The head of the other family became a Count, responsible for the worlds at
the core of their former PE.  (Irrespective of the formal government types
- - they are ruled by family members.)

The commanders of the local IN regular fleet were, traditionally, drawn
from outside the subsector.

The rivalry between the two noble families simmered throughout the next few
centuries, sometimes becoming furious, sometimes almost passing into
ancient history.  The families even intermarried.  In fact the heads of the
families in the early 600s are cousins, if you feel like it.  But still,
one family has always tended to overshadow the other.

When Olav pulled off his coup, and declared martial law, the local Naval
Admiral replaced the Duke as head of the imperial bureaucracy.  Needless to
say, the Count sniggered a lot as his rival was cut down to size, and
became a Plankwell-supporter, of sorts.  The Duke, on the other hand, was
hopping mad, and sided with the \'Legitimist\' faction of Moot supporters
(and of course he was entitled to sit in the Moot..)

After a certain amount of the noble families cutting each other socially, 
the local Admiral gets orders to take the Fleet elsewhere, leaving the
Count in control of the Subsector.  

The PCs are, of course, innocent by-standers when everything hits the fan.

I\'d have thought 157MB of uncompressed tML, when cleaned up and compressed
would be less than 65MB.

Are you going to remove all the quoted material as part of the cleanup?

The problem stems from the nature of VE2. In FFS you get a certain type
of armour at a certain TL, where as in VE2 you get a certain type of
armour at a TL and then it gets better every TL after it is introduced. Thus
in GURPS Adv Laminates are introduced at GTL7 and just keep getting
better. Thus under GURPS, Bonded Superdense will never be as good
as adv laminates. And yes I agree, it is a problem that changes the nature
of the game.

	(I don\'t know whether there is explosive-only reactive armor, 
	since all reactive panels I have seen or read about were metal 
	panels backed with explosive charge.)

	The shaped charge of HEAT warhead produces high-velocity jet of 
	superplastic metal which flows like a thick liquid for a short 
	time. Reactive armor attempts to disrupt the formation of this 
	penetrator by pushing the warhead away from the target. While 
	the superplastic penetrator acts as liquid, it is still 
	relatively cool (not thermally molten). Many authors have 
	mistaken the superplastic effect as thermal effect, probably 
	because the abbreviation "HEAT - High Explosive Anti Tank" can 
	be considered to be referring to a thermal effects. Some authors 
	prefer the term "HEAP - High Explosive Armor Piercing", but even 
	this has problems since "AP" sometimes refers to "Anti 
	Personnel".
	
	When a reactive armor is activated, the explosion pushes the 
	armor panel (and the HEAT warhead which has struck the panel) 
	away from the hull. If this happens fast enough, the warhead is 
	removed from the hull before the warhead has generated the 
	superplastic penetrator. Half-formed penetrator may still have
	penetrated deep into the hull before reactive armor interrupts
	the action.

	(The previous statement might be true for explosive-only
	reactive armor, but I still could not find any references.)

	Activated reactive panels may be very dangerous to unprotected 
	troopers nearby. The panels are quite heavy, and the explosion 
	pushes them off with high initial velocity (in order to push the 
	HEAT warhead quickly off the hull). The separated panel turns 
	into non-aerodynamic projectile which loses velocity fast but 
	is very unpredictable. Activated reactive panels are sometimes 
	called as "cannon-fired manhole covers".

	An exploding HEAT warhead is dangerous to troopers near the 
	target vehicles whether of not the armor is penetrated or 
	reactive armor is used. When the shaped charge forms the 
	superplastic penetrator, the explosion also breaks the outer 
	shell of warhead into a cloud of fragments which may affect
	any secondary targets outside of the main target.

	Reactive armor panels can sometimes be triggered with heavy 	
	bullets (14.5 mm KPV has done the trick). Some modern anti-armor 
	warheads contain precursor charges ("ticklers") which attempt
	to activate the reactive panels so that the main warhead may
	strike unprotected armor.

Sorry, the architecture in Knightfall is not from the Ancients, but

A snub pistol, by itself, won\'t crack Battledress. With HEAP rounds,

This was because they were so much more common than heavier

Remember that AHL and Snapshot are designed as limited-purpose

It\'s called ERA (Explosive Reactive Armour), and it\'s old hat.
Basically, you cover the hull in little boxes of explosives, which are
triggered by an incoming round. The versions that are commonplace now
don\'t help much against KE rounds like APFSDS (armour-piercing fin
stabilised discarding sabot)- the main anti-tank rounds; but they are
great against CE rounds like HEAT (High explosive anti-tank).

Russia has a new type of ERA, called Kontact-5, which is good against
APFSDS too - in fact, the min gun of an M1A2 won\'t penetrate it.

And while combined arms is the name of the game, you don\'t want the
infantry to be right on top of the tank...

Yes, understood. However, the main argument seems to be that the
proposed BD is relying an awful lot on physical protection. You could
probably slacken off on the physical protection, install a smaller power
plant (better stealth); and achieve a similar level of mission
protection for less cost.

Doesn\'t firing the FGPM take some time (locking the suit in the firing
position et al?) If so, be prepared to be shot first.

  A TL 6 HMG vs a flak jacket is at +3/+2 to long range (2/r of maximum, 
or 1-1.2 km?), which means that the target is squikked at least 70+% of 
the time. If you use cloth as a proto-CES type thing, then it\'s only +1/0
(still lays `em out most of the time at effective range, and low morale
troops will lose cohesion under that hammering).

  If you use mods for higher TL HMG ammo then the target really shouldn\'t 
get in the way at all

  If you\'re using the Striker system to support CT roleplay then it\'s
actually sort of worse, as a 12.7 should be doing 4 or 5 dice of damage,
with partial penetrations (7-) doing reduced damage per an old JTAS article.

  So at TL 8 you could have an AP(DU?) round with Pens of 8/6/4 (ROF +3/+2/+1,
IIRC) and D = 4 versus cloth armour of AV 5. At extreme range you\'re pretty
much counting on low hit probabilities to stay intact, and at closer ranges
the targets are probably just doing something stupid...

Can we get this into the GT 2nd Ed Printing as errata and align the design
systems a bit better? Of course, it\'d kill the uber-BD that Doug is working
on. Other items of equipment have modified multipliers in the GT book, so
why not the materials types?

It\'s kind of funny, I actually don\'t object to the BD Doug is suggesting;
I\'d just prefer the systems more in line (and metric, but that\'s another
story).

Last summer we had a combat between our heavily armored Laranian paladin
and an equally armored Priest of Agrik.  After several dozen rounds, both
combatants were too tired to lift their weapons, but neither had sustained
much more than bruises.

Would you like to move to San Francisco?  Since you seem to be so skilled
at putting words in my mouth, I figure I could just let you speak for me
and rest my vocal cords.

What I said was that I was going to spend some space on non-traditional
military campaigns.  I did not say that I wouldn\'t spend any space on IA
combat units that would be armed with gauss rifles and wearing CES.

If it has my name on it, even if the suits are designed by someone else, it
is skin off my nose.  I take pride in my work.

What started this was my description of the modified disad Combat Paralysis

No, I was shot at while wearing US army BDUs, which can\'t stop mosquitos,
let alone hostile fire.  I have also been shot at while wearing a t-shirt
and jeans.  Both of these events made me wish that I could be invulnerable
to fire.

That\'s because we don\'t have the technology.  The Imperium does have that
technology.

I hate anime, and don\'t read comics.  In the "real World", there is no FTL
drive, aliens descended from wolves, or star-spanning empires.  Perhaps you
should remember that this is a science-fiction RPG, not a modern day RPG.

This sounds like the TL limits for lasers we ended up with in TNE. I could
live with that.

OTOH, could you design the GT main book battle armour without advanced
laminate? Would it have close to the same performance?

The problem with "appeals to bureaucracy" is that if a rule can be
min-maxed there are those who will do so, and sooner or later one of their
designs will see print (editors can\'t catch every canon-buster). I\'d rather
see the limits clearly laid out.

Exactly: a subset. Whatever we come up with should be compatible with VE2,
because that\'s the system GT uses. Adding a limitation to VE2 (in the GT
universe) is a lot easier than extending it.

Hm. What weapons would require really fast traverse times? Point defense
lasers. How much more complicated would it make things to set an upper mass
limit on PD turrets?

And if I have my entire ship armoured to 10 000, will a missile worry me
anyway?

One of the largest Droyne ships ever seen, the Ssaybom is an odd
combination of explorer and warship first observed in the Five Sisters
subsector in 1119. Imperial analysts are baffled by the apparent
confounding of two distinct functions, yet the Droyne have turned aside all
questions.

Why does a warship need such extensive research facilities? Why does a
scoutship need a meson gun? Are the Droyne anticipating attack, and if so
from where? Is the Ssaybom\'s appearance connected with the disappearance
and reappearance of all Droyne ships in 1118? Why is Muodray personally

Actually, this is just a naming convention -- \'advanced laminate\' just means
\'advanced armor which is doubled against shaped charges\'.  At TL 7 this is
laminate armor.

Gurps Traveller: Battledress
by The TML

144 pages:
3 pages of inconsistent battledress designs
1 page of battledress thong
10 pages of Gurps tech vs. Trav tech
    Half, Gurp tech must be limited in Trav.
    Half, everything in Gurps is available
90 pages of back-handed insults, veiled threats,
bitching, moaning, and kvetching (vilani for whining).

Its time to move this thread to "closure".  At least with
regard to the rising temperature.

Mr. Jackson\'s post "Sane Battledress" is a very positive
move in this direction.

Just a voice from the bleachers, but here is my wishlist for
the thread:

1) A discussion about Gurps Vehicles as a Battledress
design system, focussing on whether _all_ Gurps technology,
specifically advanced laminates, are appropriate for the GT
universe. Keeping in mind that limiting Gurps tech for the
GT universe began in the first book, GT. (This idea
originally suggested by Maj. Thrash.).

2) Designing more "Sane" battledress, as Mr. Jackson
has already done.

3) Deconstructing currently published battledress designs
(as well as any other vehicle which may need it), with
an eye towards \'fixing\' them for errata.  Some of this
has already taken place, and I welcome it, as well as
the little valuable tidbits, such as the one about a BD
wearer in a flightpack is a juicy target.

Unfortunately, this would invalidate quite a bit of published work.  Personally,
I would have just changed the tech progression so that TTL 15 is early GTL-11 
in which case, being an \'early\' TL, many systems available at that TL,
including advanced armor, wouldn\'t be available.  This fixed problems with
all _kinds_ of ultratech listed in GURPS).  This would make the best armor
at that TL roughly twice as strong as bonded SD.  It\'s way too late to make
that change, though.

Of course, then there might be complaints about how primitive GT considers
traveller technology -- but by GURPS standards, the best traveller
technology _is_ pretty primitive.

I\'ve got this idea for an adventure involving a vaccuum flower species
that produces an organic superconductor in its innards.  Several questions
come to mind: 

1. Has anyone given any serious thought to the ecology/biology of vaccuum
flowers?  How realistic is this idea?  It\'s been mentioned in several CT
sources and I think it\'s cool, but it seems a little unlikely to me
intuitively.  One thing I considered is that such a thing might evolve on
a world that slowly loses its atmosphere over eons.  After all, all a
plant really needs is energy and a few common elements, right?  How would
transport mechanisms work at extreme temperatures?  Could it use liquid
nitrogen to move nutrients around inside itself if it was at very low
temp?  What could be used at high temp?  What about radiation?  Would they
only appear in shadows and cold worlds?

2. What are the problems involved in a plant producing superconductive
organics?  As I understand it (which isn\'t very well) the ceramics are
composed of fairly ordinary elements (CHONPS and stuff like
Selenium, Gallium and Chlorine). But I don\'t know how easy it would be for
an organic process to put these things together in the proper way.

3. What is the state of superconductors in the Imperium?  Do they have
room temp ones?  High temp ones?  Would there be a market for a plant that
produced relatively high-temp superconductive materials?

Armor isn\'t the big factor; taking my design as an example, only about 10% of
the cost is for armor.  By comparison, 35% of the cost is for stealth and
electronics.

Shrug.  Not really.  800 pounds of armor does a fine job of suppressing
recoil. It\'s about as fast as shooting a rifle.

Well, damn spank me and call me a Solomani monkey...I\'ve had that books

Really starts to color my opinion of Cleon 1 darker. Also makes me
wonder just how Mad \'Cleon III\' was ... maybe the moot just finally
decided that power mad sociopaths weren\'t needed on the Imperial throne
anymore...

I\'m behind on the current version so I\'m not sure if you\'ve done this
or not, but as I suggested a ways back, and actually tried to organize,
sorting them by government and/or manufacturer would be great.

  In Striker they differentiated between TL D (AV: 10) and TL E+ (AV: 18)

The Tree-Oxen come from an example in _At Close Quarters_.  Originally, I
had a Denebian Tree-Ox butting a poor sap named Leroy.  Later in the book,
we met a poisonous vermin named a Guatney.

The legal difference?  Zero.  A cruiser is a cruiser is a cruiser.
Mercenaries are legal under imperial law.  Planetary law may
vary.  But if someone on a planet is hiring mercenaries, the
time for legal disputes is pretty much over.  There may be
legal consequences if you lose, of course.


I\'ve got a draft of some general foundations of Imperial Law
here:
http://portcaddo.com/bloo/traveller/implaw.htm

Its a bit academic.  Ok, more than a bit.


Would be very interested to see what you collect.

I\'d really say it was a matter of use more than anything else. A
mercenary cruiser would be a ship operated in support of a mercenary
company; ie: transporting troops, their gear, and providing logistic and
combat support once at the destination.

Within the Imperium, I suspect you will need some sort of licensure, and
need to post bonds (above and beyond repatriation bonds) to ensure you
don\'t just go pirate. Running a merc company cannot be cheap...

A Merchant cruiser is an upgunned, uparmored freighter designed to live
in poorly protected or unprotected (by the IN, that is) regions of
space...basically it\'s better able to defend itself while runnign from
problems. This is unlikley to require the types of bonding that an
privately owned, overtly military ship, such as a mercenary cruiser
would require.

In practice you could probably use the same _ship_ for both purposes,
though an ideal design would probably be different for each use.

In term of legality, there are probably limits as to _where_ in the
Imperium you can run such a ship without hassles; probably more so than
if you were a registered, bonded mercenary company.

Planetary law is as planetary law does, meaning you can have just about
anything. As a generalization, I\'ll say most systems probably regulate
ships based on their armor and armament, rather than their stated
purpose. A Happy Fun Ball is a Happy Fun Ball, whether you\'re moving
mercenaries in staterooms or groats in shipping containers.

  Being a Solomani apologist I can at least understand, but spreading this
sort of pernicious disinformation leads one to assume that you\'ve either
been co-opted by SolSec - or you\'re an agent.

  The Zhodani Consulate, in addition to being devoted to truth, peace, justice,
harmony*, and the distribution of fluffy bunnies to children everywhere**, is
both larger and more advanced and has fundamentally cooler looking outfits,
which latter is kind of odd when you consider that the Solomani _are_ a bunch
of facists, after all...

Ahh, but Rambo had a bug between the Real Universe and the Rambo Universe!
The design rules for rocket launchers were changed in the Rambo Universe so
they didn\'t have a backblast and he could fire them from inside
helicopters. This invalidated the previous canon \'Real Universe\'. Debate
continues as to whether the Rambo Universe is an official variant stuck in
the Reagan 80s, or if it has become defacto canon.

Desperately outclassed by the forces of the Zira Siirka, the outnumbered
Terrans developed the missile boat, a small craft armed exclusively with
missiles, and deployed it in squadrons capable of overwhelming a Vilani
warship\'s point defenses.

The present Congreve-class missile boat is a continuation of that
tradition. Armed with a massive missile bay, and with enough armour to
ignore turret weapons at long range, doctrine calls for several squadrons
of missile boats to jump into a system, overwhelm the target with a massive
barrage, and then jump back to their base for resupply.

During the Solomani Rim War the Imperial Navy inflicted defeat after defeat
on Solomani forces. Operational analysis indicated that, surprisingly,
missile boats were one of the most cost-effective means the Solomani
possessed of damaging their more technologically advanced enemies.

The von Braun is a typical Solomani design: starkly functional, with little
consideration given to crew comfort. All personnel but the commander share
a common bunkroom. The grav compensators are overloaded at max
acceleration, forcing the crew to remain at their stations without relief.
These savings have bought one of the fastest warships known, with 7G
acceleration, enough fuel for two successive jumps, and a Hun-class light
fighter.

After the Solomani Rim War, the Solomani Navy started development of a new

had. The result was the Hun, with over 10G of acceleration at full

        If you don\'t, then it is worth my while to build hell\'s own

I think that you\'re misreading the framwork of the rule. Advanced Laminate
isn\'t a specific kind of material, like steel or kevlar. The reason it gets
better as TL increases is that the individual materials that the layers are
made out of change. Presupposing some advancement in materials science per
tech level it makes sense that the DR of advance laminate would improve as
TL goes up. I\'d say that at higher GTL\'s, 14 or 15, other kinds of armor
will replace it. As this is beyond any TL in Traveller (Except Ancients
tech) AL is the best armor.

        Hello!

        Well, I am a Heretic by nature, but I can see somethings would be
pretty equal in this issue.  Firstly, the issue is really armament, not
cargo.  Face it...  take a standard Liner and equip all the turrets with
missiles and load the staterooms with gun-bunnies and it *stops* being a
liner.  It\'s now a merc ship.
        IMTU, any vessel with more than 30% of its hardpoints equipped with
offensive systems needs a permit (Cr10000 per weapon per year).  More than
60% of the hardpoints equipped with offensive systems, and you\'re a warship,
no word-games whatsoever.  At which point you get treated like a warship...
So long as you don\'t annoy the authorities with your warship, the
authorities don\'t hunt you down with an SDB task group and blow you to
plasma.  Wether or not you are carrying tractor parts, cattle, conducting
exploration or lab experiments, or moving a company of armor, is irrelevant.  
        Speed, armor, defensive screens, range...  none of these, by
definition, do a gun-boat make.  Its the weapons load that tells the tale.
        The ships that fall into that middle 30% are bit more difficult to
classify.  In those cases, the authorities will tend to compare what they
see for themselves (cargo and crew manifests) with what the registration
papers say before they decide wether or not to hassle the captain.  If
everything jives, then there probably aren\'t any legal ramifications.  If
something looks funny (our gun-bunny liner), then perhaps a customs search,
a health and safety inspection would be in order and then progress upwards
in seriousness depending on the demeanor of the crew and what was uncovered.
        The biggest thing is that there is a lot of shipping in the 3I.
Even my TNEC millieu, in the Core areas around Terra, Alpha Centari and
Sirius make current-day Amsterdam look like an isolated costal village in
terms of traffic.  The man power required to police everything, everywhere
is staggering.  So unless the ship in question is doing something to attract
attention to itself around major worlds, what it does in the back-waters
will be large between it and the Backwater.
        Now, obviously, at said Backwater, the instant a registered Merc
Cruiser drops out of jump, you *know* the planetary defense organization
gets notified and pays attention.  I would wonder if human nature would
prompt more concern at the appearance of an "attack liner" as I describe
above, which isn\'t *officially* an invasion ship, but could certainly look
like one in a hurry.
        Same idea for a couple of "Trade Assault Cruisers" that both come
out of Jump at the same time...  only a dummy wouldn\'t wonder if they aren\'t
carrying something more interesting/ of concern than farm machinery in their
holds.  The same two ships which didn\'t fit the "warship" catergory probably
wouldn\'t get a second glance after their transponder data checked out.

        Just some thoughts.

That\'s not quite what\'s going on in VE2. "Advanced laminate" isn\'t a
material, it\'s a relative quality and a construction method. Materials are
introduced as "advanced", then become "expensive" one TL higher, "standard"
the TL after that, and "cheap" three TL\'s after introduction. It is true,
however, that new materials are always being introduced to fill the
"advanced" category.

This is an extract from the rough draft of GT: Starships. It is based on
some descriptive text about armor that was in GURPS Vehicles, 1st Ed, but
was cut from 2d Ed (probably to save space). This is the raw GURPS version
and has not been compared or converted to Traveller terminology, so don\'t
tell me there is no "bonded superdense" -- I know that.

<<snips Bruce\'s comments on merchant cruisers>>

The term "merchant cruiser" seems to derive from the "armed merchant
cruisers" of World Wars I and II.  These were large merchant vessels
(usually liners, due to their high speed), requisitioned by a
government, armed, and commissioned as auxiliary warships.  Their
primary role in the Royal Navy was as convoy escorts, protecting against
surface raiding vessels.  Examples would be HM Ships JERVIS BAY amd
RAWALPINDI, both of which were sunk by German capital ships during World
War II.  Note that these ships flew the White Ensign (indicating a
warship of the Royal Navy).  Other navies, such as the German navy,
employed such vessels as commerce raiders.  Examples include ATLANTIS
and KORMORAN (the latter ship fought the light cruiser HMAS SYDNEY; both
ships were sunk in the battle).

As such, merchant cruisers would legally be indistinguishable from other
warships.

Handwaves I\'m okay with -- they don\'t create rules, they rationalize them.
I\'m considerably more reluctant to implement a change to the rules without
working through the implications, especially the hidden ones. Look at the
"3 cradles = 1 turret" rule: I\'m already being told that my example LASH
freighter in FT is an illegal design because that rule appears in Star
Mercs, and I ported the damn cradles in from VE2 myself. I\'m going to have
to either modify ("elaborate") the rule for GT: Starships, figure out an
interpretation that covers all examples to date, or errata the design --
all because someone published a new rule without checking for consequences.

Just like to point out that in the US Infantry, Rambo occupies a spot just
below John Wayne in disgust.

Wearing a helmet without the chin strap fashioned is "John Wayne", and is bad.

Standing exposed with a M-60 on a ridge is "Rambo", and is *really* bad...

Major expansion.  In addition to the current alphabetical index,
I think an index by mission (warships [or possibly different
classes of warship], military transports, civilian passenger
transports, tramp traders, civilian cargo transports, etc.) would
be a good idea, and possibly an index by national origin (e.g.,
Imperial, Droyne, Solomani, Zhodani, etc.).

Check Adventure 12:  Secret of the Ancients.  It seems to me that it has

Either The Spinward Marches Campaign or Alien Adventures has an
adventure set on Emerald, involving a squad of lost Zhodani troopers who
don\'t know that the war is over. I don\'t remember maps; maybe, maybe
not.

I posted a lot about this a few years ago (1994 or 1995, I think).  I

as I do.  On the other hand, you may find those posts faster than I.

I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about.  "Merchant", a civilian term,
doesn\'t go with "cruiser", a naval ship type.  

Imperial merchant ships are owned by private persons or entities and are
engaged in trade.  They are registered at some world, where they can be
subject to legal process.  They are also regulated as to safety and
related matters by some Imperial agency.  They are subject to local laws
and starport regulations.  

Non-Imperial merchant ships may enter Imperial star systems pursuant to
the terms of their entry permits and engage in trade in accordance with
the applicable treaty between their home state and the Imperium, if such
a treaty exists.  Otherwise, they can engage in whatever trade the
Imperial member state will permit.  Entry permits may be issued in
advance from Imperial consulates or upon entry into an Imperial border
world\'s star system.  

Mercenary cruisers:  I assume "merc" means "mercenary."  "Cruiser"
usually means a mid-sized naval ship able to engage in warfare on its
own, i.e., without constant logistical and combat support.  Large
mercenary units would like to be able to operate with substantial
independence, so they would characterize their ships as "cruisers". 
These again are privately-owned ships.  They are engaged in a business
that is not unlawful under Imperial law, although it might be under the
laws of various member states.  Such ships must be registered and
regulated like any other privately-owned vessels, and are subject to
local laws and starport regulations.  When invited to an Imperial member
state, the inviting state typically waives any requirement that
starships be restricted to the starport.  

Mercenary ships engaged in anti-shipping activity run afoul of the
Imperial piracy laws unless they are registered combatant vessels in a
declared trade war.  (See The Traveller Book, or maybe The Traveller
Adventure.)  (Similarly, mercenary troops engaged in ground operations
may be committing various crimes such as breach of the peace, murder,
and mayhem, absent immunity through treaties or conventions among the
combatants.)

The Imperial Navy generally frowns on private ownership of large
warships capable of meaningful engagements with the Navy.

The reason is logical:  This ship is supposed to go where no Droyne has
gone before.  Haven\'t Imperial analysts seen holovids of the ancient
Terran entertainment called "Star Trek", in which the most heavily armed
ships of the fleet are also the centers of scientific research and
exploration?

Unfortunately, no maps of Emerald are included in the adventure.

So far I have the following sections in the index:

Background: subsections like "people" (Eneri the Eighth), "events" (the
Great Scone Caper), "corporations", "shipyards" (this would be
manufacturer), "organizations" (Imperial Naval Intelligence)

Naval Forces: subsections by government (Third Imperium, Solomani
Confederation)

Ships: subsections by type of ship (destroyers, cruisers, freighters...)
with a subsection for "auxiliaries" so you can see which ships usually
carry a Helm-class fighter

I was thinking of having a "Where Encountered" section as well, and
possibly one my time period, but thought that this would grow fairly large
fairly quickly. I could do it if it would be useful, though.

You are probably right from the gear aspect, but I\'ve used modified
FUDGE and T4 for the task resolution at different times.  I suspect
I\'ll migrate toward TNE more and more...it\'s growing on me.  No,
it\'s *not* a fungus! ;-J

Well, okay that\'s fair.  I keep the mechanics hidden in order to
keep the players immersed in their characters, and because I switch

Yeah, I do try to maintain the things that make Traveller,
Traveller:  One week jump drive, travel based communications, grav
control and staying relatively close to RW science for most other
things.

I doubt they\'ll go to open source.  But still, porting to Linux/x86 would be 
the hard part.  A couple compiler directives could handle most of the 
compiling issues if they pay attention to what\'s going on.  I can\'t remember 
off the top of my head if a PPC is big-endian or little-endian.  But if the 
Mac OSX uses stock Xwindows, it should be easy to port from the x86.

One other consideration comes up in G: Special Ops 2nd Ed, pg 45)

"The point totals for modern special ops soldiers will thus be justifiably
higher than those for most characters.  Realistically, most of these points
should go into skills; special ops soldiers on active training spend all of
their time training."

So a case could be made for active duty Marines (and other members of
intense military organizations like Imperial jump troop Divisions) being
allowed a little latitude when it comes to the Age x 2 rule, as long as
they are active duty and thusly training or fighting constantly.

thank you for the feedback!

It\'s all come in very useful already (I\'ve got one player
who\'s burning up the Web with his emails from work. :-))

Bloo, I have some Imperial law writeups I\'d like to send
you offline for your comments/amusement. Your draft is
right along the lines of what I\'d like to write up myself.

Bruce, your thought on limiting where such a ship can
operate legally was one I hadn\'t really considered. I am
now.

Michel, I\'ve borrowed your entire writeup for immediate
use in my campaign. The level of detail is perfect.
Of course, I guess that reveals my somewhat heretical
leanings towards Traveller but what the heck. ;-)

Black ICE, your links were great for helping me scale
"acceptable weaponry" in my campaign.

If anyone else has any feedback, please post away! I\'m
getting the TML in digest form so I won\'t actually read
it until Monday, though.

Thanks again, all.

Yup.

My take on the Solomani Confederation is, it\'s not *quite* cohesive enough to 
do that, even if they tried hard.  There was just as much factionalisation as 
in the Imperium, with the hardliners getting ready to go off on the 
moderates, and so forth.  Plus, you have to keep in mind travel times and 
communication times.  Part of what made the Imperium die was the 
communications lag.

TNE is shiny?  I admit I haven\'t read much of it, only having SM, but I\'ve 
also read quite a bit off the web.  And I dunno bout you, but even 
considering the inhabitants of cemetary worlds are totally ficticious, it 
*still* gets to me sometimes when I read a subsector list with both 1115 and 
1200 data in it.  Having seen a bit of the real thing in the Real World, it 
sometimes takes me a minute to remember that it\'s *just a game*.  But the 
feeling I get from the setting is prolly like what Neanderthal Man felt about 
Cro Magnon when they first started showing up in the \'hood.  
\'Congratulations.  You just came in in 2nd Place in the Evolutionary 
Sweepstakes!\'  You don\'t get this in M:0.

I think Virus was a bit of overkill, personally.  HT did the job nicely enough of trimming everything back.  Virus wasn\'t needed to \'clear the decks\'.

I\'ve never played MT, just CT.  But I mine MT for ideas *constantly*  A great 
resource for me.  The problem I\'m having with G:T is, everything IMTU 
postulates the Rebellion is taking place.  Thus, its \'it\'s all a bad dream\' 
premise just won\'t work for me.  And while I own a copy of the original 
Spinward Marches LBB (*and* Solomani Rim, for that matter), my game is set in 
Reavers\' Deep, so the Spinward Marches stuff doesn\'t help me a bit.  What I\'d 
like to know, though, is there any warfare rules or chrome in First In?

Without a doubt, I agree about HT.  Great set of rules to \'devolve\' societies

This one I\'m not so sure about.  But I *am* happy that *somebody* is keeping the Traveller name alive until the next version comes out.

The funny thing about FD&tDA is that the band comprises three Solomani
boys from Terra and a deaf Vargr drummer.  Their fans sometimes get into
violent altercations with fans of Hiver Death! (the exclamation point is
officially part of the name), a band from the other side of the same
continent of Terra.

GURPS DR and FFS AV serve about the same purpose in their respective
games, and both scale linearly, so we should be able to express FFS
materials in GURPS terms (and vice versa).

In FFS, 1 cm of hard steel has an AV of 2.  In GURPS, 1 inch of hard
steel has a DR of 70, and little conversion gives us approximately
28 DR per cm.  This gives us a conversion factor to work with.  We
can say that DR 14 ~= 1 AV.  We can take a ratio of each material
and hard steel and apply the conversion factor to get the
following...
                    AV      DR

 Coherent SD       40.00   560.00

This is aimed at Traveller folks that might want to use GURPS stuff,
but not convert to GRUPS itself.  I am well aware that the numbers
I\'m generating here aren\'t GRUPS standard.  I really don\'t care, this
conversion works for me.

Okay, here are some examples (not digs).  

We have a Battlesuit with a DR 1200 armor factor?  In Traveller
terms that\'s 6.12 cm of SD, 10.71 cm of CrystalIron, 14.86 cm of
Composite Laminate, or 42.86 cm of Hard Steel.

Starships have a min AV of 40?  In GURPS terms that means they need
DR 560 of armor, and we can get that with 5 cm of CrystalIron or
2.86 cm of SD.

Personal Armor?
  Heavy Kevlar: DR 12 = 0.84 AV (0.21 cm Light Composite)
  Combat Infantry Dress:  DR 40 = 2.86 AV (0.48 cm Comp Laminate*)

I\'m not grumbling too much, I never thought GT\'s material would be
more than source for me.  I might use the numbers from above though,
yes they make AV\'s a lot higher, but they also allow more variation
between the steps.  I also think GURPS weapons (or G^3 conveted to
GURPS) are easier to create than FFS weaspons.

ISTR reading on a Web site about a TNE-timeline band named Lucan and the
Imperials, or some such (I don\'t remember the backup band\'s name, but I
know that the leader used the name Lucan).  Anybody know where I can
find this again?

GT: expensive TL 10 metal is .1, expensive TL 12 metal is .04 (used in starships).  IIRC FF&S had a rule which increased the DR of thin sheets of armor due to surface effects.

You can grab \'bundles\' (of 10) digests from 
<ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/Gaming/Traveller/> in .tar.Z (Unix TAR and GZip) as 
far back as May 96.  Earlier than that and you\'re looking at messages 
from the old server which have a different naming scheme.  Poke around 
the directories - you\'ll find them.

Basically, whilst the TML archives at ftp.mpgn.com are mostly intact, 
they show signs of their age - different naming schemes, different 
encoding schemes, different bundling schemes - what you would expect from 
successive administrators of the box and/or the list (whoever was 
responsible, I don\'t know).  It can get a bit confusing trying to sort 
out exactly what belongs where, let me tell you.

Anyway, the lack of a clear, easy to reference archive of the list is 
*one* of the factors that prompted me to clean things up a bit.  Even 
though the digests are there, they are not organised in such a way as to 
actually be useful (with the exception of a lone "TOPICS" file in one of 
the directories, which at least made an attampt at being a reference).

Hmmm...  Would I be treading on anyone\'s toes if I put the organised 
archive on a CD and made it available to anyone who was interested on a 
STRICTLY not-for-profit basis?  I did a web search and found that there 
was some sort of TravellerCD project started (in 1996?) but no recent 
refs and no website, so I assume that didn\'t make it far.

LBBs seem to support this.  But it\'s more like, the opportunists were in the

But they\'re nowhere NEAR as good as the "original" lineup, which 
went by the name of \'Death Droyne and the Flaming Ancients\'
They had to change their name because the abbreviation DDatFA

I can see the reasoning behind the rule: exterior ships use up surface
area. OTOH, the number of cradles required is a function of _mass_, while
the surface area required is a function of _volume_, which means that
really havy fighters can\'t be mounted on the surface.

If I was being consulted (which I wasn\'t), I\'d have used a rule to the
effect that every nn dtons of carried craft used up the surface area
required for one turret.


I\'ve thought of another handwave for the "turrets should have 1/2 armour"
guideline. By making the turret armour 1/2 the hull armour, the designer is
simulating the effect of openings for the launch tube/laser, sensor arrays,
and so forth. The lesser armour factor is just to reflect the change that
these vulnerable bits may be hit.

Would this work?

I thought that it had already been established that what moves is the aiming
mirror, the turret rotation is relatively irrelevant.

>And if I have my entire ship armoured to 10 000, will a missile worry me anyway?

It should. 

Missiles do damage of 6d*100(5)*relative Gs (GT page 159). So a missile moving
at one G relative will do an average of 2100(5) or damage 10 500 worth of
armour. So the first relative G is required to go through your 10 000 point
armour. Any relative Gs after the the first will be internal damage - at an
average of 2100 damage per additional G. In any reasonable (consensual fly by)
combat you are usually talking high double figure relative Gs.

Kinetic Kill Missiles are often a one shot kill. Which is why PDF is so
important.

M0 as written is wonderfully dark. The Zhunastu School of Contact and the
whole realpolitik things can make for a delightful game of intrigue and
double dealing. Remember in M0, trust no one.

It\'s the unix \'compress\' utility.  Tell Winzip they\'re unix compressed tars.  
I\'m fairly sure it understands compress.  I *know* it understands gzip.

Actually, Winzip pops a box up with the filename, asking for an
extension, when I try to EXTRACT.  It doesn\'t allow me to select a
compression routine.

I used Unix TAR and Compress (which I mistakenly referred to as GZip in 
my last post, sorry) to produce a .tar.Z of the whole lot and it came in 
at 71 MB.  I then used StuffIt Deluxe to do the same thing and that came 
in at 65 MB.  Since there wasn\'t a drastic difference between the two, I 
figure that they pretty-well define the outfield of "the ballpark".

I\'m not a compression guru, so I\'m happy to stick with compression 
formats and engines that are widely accepted, even though others may be 
able to sqeeze an archive down a bit further, at the cost of using 
obscure formats/compressors.

As for what will go and what will stay:

1)  The 740 byte footer (at the bottom of this digest, for example) will 
definitely be going.  Although it does serve a purpose when it is being 
emailed, no such purpose is served when the digests are part of a larger 
archive (which can singly be referenced).

2)  The old list server included "To:" and "Message-ID:" lines for every 
message.  Since To; is obvious and Message-ID serves no purpose, they 
will also be stripped.

3)  All attachments will be stripped.  Why attachments were ever allowed 
in the first place, I don\'t know, but they are gone.

4)  The old list server also attributed authors to the subjects in the 
summary at the top - they\'ll go.

5)  A number of mailers produce X-Headers like "Organization:", "Lines:", 
Sender:", "References:", and so-on...  All that will be stripped.

6)  MIME and HTML fluff will also be stripped (can\'t say I\'ve noticed 
much, but I\'ll check just to make sure).

7)  Auto-responder messages "Sorry, but I\'m on holiday..." will be 
stripped in toto, and the summary section amended accordingly.

8)  Clueless messages "How do I unsubscribe?"  will be stripped in toto, 
and the summary section amended accordingly.

But, to finally answer your question, NO, I will NOT be removing quoted 
material.  Although that would undoubtedly result in the biggest savings, 
some messages simply don\'t make sense when read without the quoted 
material.

It could be argued that the Subject: line could be used to reference the 
thread, but many Digest subscribers were (and are still) too slack to 
bother renaming the Subject: field and, as a result, the number of 
messages with "Re: Traveller-digest V1999 #839"-type subjects remains 
high.  The meaning of these messages would be completely lost if the 
quoted material was removed.

- --
SIDE NOTE:  I configured my own mailing list server to reject messages 
which contain "Re: ... Digest #n".  This quickly and effectively taught 
the subscribers to rename the subject lines.  I know majordomo is capable 
of being scripted to do this, but does anyone here have the connections 
required to implement such a trivial (yet useful) mod?
- --

One thing I *have* been experimenting with is hyperlinking messages.  
Say, for example, that you read this message and then post a reply.  I\'ve 
got a link script in alpha which will flags your message as being a 
followup to mine.  When you use a web browser to view my original 
message, the contents of your "From:" field (usually your real name and 
your email address) appears in a side-frame as being a "followup" (along 
with everyone else who did the same).

The difference between my script and all of the others that I\'ve seen 
(which can be applied to text digests) is that they determine replies 
based only on the "Subject:" field, whereas I use pattern-matching within 
the body of a message itself to further refine the followup chain.  The 
neat thing about this approach is that it will follow a thread *even if 
the subject line changes* (to "Oh God, not again (was Re: 
Traveller-digest V1999 #839)" for example.  ;)

Like I said, its in alpha, but initial trials look good.  If 
the-powers-that-be let me put the archive on CD, then I\'ll almost 
certainly hyperlink the whole lot - that would make navigation just sooo 
much easier.

Henry.

Damn.  I know there was a unix decompressor laying around for DOS someplace,
but I can\'t remember where it\'s at.  You check TuCows?

BTW, I don\'t \'do\' Win9x, so I don\'t have this kinda info around on me anymore.

If they are unix gzip files WinZip should handle with no problems, version
7.0 definitely does

Otherwise they might be the old unix "compress" files, in which case you
need to find a dos/win version of the compress utility

Remarks:
        The Normandy-class MDS is intended to conduct operations where they
can have the full support of an integrated task force.  Unlike the
Diplomat-class vessels which can and do at times operate independantly of a
task force, the Normandy only does one thing...  deliever a battalion of
Marines to a planetary surface.
        The plethora of beam laser turrets are to function as AAW/PD systems
as well as counter-battery fire during landings.  The armor belt is to give
some defense to the craft while landed unloading her Marine compliment.  She
has no real combat redundancy nor expanded electronics to operate as a
command ship.  The Normandy-class vessels are delivery craft only.
        However, a government can afford 17 Normandy-class MDS for each
Diplomat-class.  This would be an effective deployment of 5 brigades.
Mission success with a Normandy is entirely dependant on her Naval support
to allow her safe passage to the target world surface.

Starship Design Sheet:
        http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/temp/normandy.html

Errata:
        The Diplomat-class description stated that she carried three
complete battalions.  This is incorrect.  These vessels carry 3 complete
*brigades*.  All numbers used were for a 3-brigade compliment.

In and of itself, I find this a very interesting idea for a GURPS
Disadvantage. 

In a desparate attempt to clear up some of the confusion, for non-
GURPS players, I will hasten to point out that this Disadvantage,
like any other disad, is a *voluntary* one, one that a player can
pick, if he thinks it will make his character more interesting. 
There are lots and lots of disads out there, this is just one of
them. I doubt very many players would take this one, but I think
it\'s a great idea -- keep it in when you write your book.

I dunno... I always thought the Zhodani turbans looked kind of goofy,

All right!  All right!  I\'ll update it.  I\'ll update it.

Jesse?  Are you still running around out there?  Got a bar scene for me?

Now your talking. Of course the nuclear warhead makes it illegal for use
inside the Imperium, but I doubt that will really disturb the Zhodani. I
also doubt anyone would bother to set them to go off just because a team of
Scouts in exploration suits walked by or a group of EOD skill weapon
merchants either. I can see a mine field full of these things having all
kinds of plot hooks. Might even be handy to salvage a few incase anyone in
BD wanted to bother you ;)

Under MT, pen is 1 for HE & Tranq, and 6 for HEAP. the HEAP rounds can and
will get minimal penetration results (AV/2 > Pen > AV/10) for 1/10th
damage... So you need a better than normal to hit roll to get damage in (I
normally round with mathematically Standard rounding)but beating the task
by 2 points will suffice to do 1 point.

I doubt that the ImpMar troops really are training EFFECTIVELY more than
50% of the available waking hours... Especially since some are going to be
pulling Gunnery Details...

Suggestion: Include an additional "skill allowance bonus" in the CGen
notes... say, 2x time in service?

That way, non-template based characters can be built... and include a
minimum age for the characters in the templates, based upon such
formulae....

Didn\'t exactly forget the limit, but have found that generally, PC\'s seldom
hit it after MOB\'s... after all, MOB\'s were doubled in MT, and +2 Edu and
+1 int were fairly common.... And, thanks for adding the TNE numbers... I
couldn\'t find  my TNE Mk1 Mod 0 or Mod 1 books...

Feh.  The Sword Worlds folk/rock/acid band Hinn Bakklatur Dauour are the

You know, it\'s funny how things are. I came up with this a year or two ago
based on materials I found on the \'net and in the books. I find it
heartening that you came up with similar values.

Mileu0, pages 82-83 give the "Archon Thesis".  A leading theory during the
Rule of Man it states that an ancient race of humans, the Archons, were the
Ancients.  This was the basis for the racial superiority logic of the
Solomani Movement.  Cleon, in trying to justify the new 3I, used this as a
legitimatizing way to say he was only putting back together something that
had once existed.

 "Considering how much stock Cleon has put in presenting the Third Imperium
as the rightful heir to both the First and Second,, the Arcon Thesis serves
his expansionist purposes as well as it did  (the Solomani of the Rule
era). "

So even as the droyne were discovered during the course of history you have
to take into account the politics of research (as anyone trying to write up
a research grant request could tell you).  Until the power of the Solomani
in the Imperial court was broken in the 660s it was probably \'common
knowledge\' that the Ancients were the Archons, ancient humans.

Then you only have a 2 century window to even think about the droyne until
the Psionic Supresssions hit.  After that not only are the droyne worlds
interdicted, but your average Imperial citizen would actively hate the
droyne.  Interdiction fleets probably saved more than one droyne world from
genicidal attacks.

Even by the 1100\'s the droyne, when they are thought of at all, are seen as
replent.  So what if the Ancients could have been the droyne?  Creepy
little monsters couldn\'t actually do anything good or advanced, that is a
crazy theory:  That is likely the opinion of your Imperial on the Street.

Only enlightened, thoughtful and very very greedy people, PCs, would even
think twice about droyne and treasure...

Actually, my complaint was that it wasn\'t enough like TNE in that
there still weren\'t any really open frontiers or big opponents to
challenge the new 3I. There *couldn\'t* be because the story had to
follow the previously written 1100 years of history. <sigh>

That could have been sarcasm....or perhaps not.  A number of TNE\'ers
insist that the underlying premise of TNE is rebirth and the
bringing of hope to the wilds.  OTOH...

...if it\'s Survival Margin and the cemetary worlds you think of when
you think of TNE then yeah it\'s a very dark world.  As for me, I
have expressed my problems with the "smash and grab" RCES pirates,
and certain other details, but I tend to come down on the pro side.
Sort of, "The last 70 years have been a time of darkness and death,
now the dawn is coming."  Of course, *I* made the collapse complete
and 7,000 years long not 70. ;->

When I read Hard Times and went back over the MT material I have (I
don\'t have it all, so my vision might be missing important pieces) I
decided that what was coming was going to be what I called The Big
Breakup.

The Imperium is gone.  In its place are a some widely scattered
systems that hold off the complete collapse.  Eventually, a few of
them will expand again and small pocket empires will form with wide
gulfs of "wild worlds" between them.

The Solomani, controlled by fanatics, overextend themselves
attacking Earth and pushing beyond.  The beginning of the end for
these fanatics is when the people of Earth reject them and there is
a crisis of confidence in the whole concept of Solomani as supermen.
A rising tide of revolts and wars sweep over the Rim and all the
peoples the Solomani have been oppressing rise up against them and
the within a few years the Rim is in the same state as the former
Imperium.

The Zeristu and the Marches are having their own troubles.  In the
first place the Vargr and the Aslan are boiling into the area from
opposite directions.  In the second there *is* something wreaking
the Zeristu Empire, maybe it\'s "sparklers", "aliens from the core",
or even that TNE construct "The Empress Wave"...I don\'t know, but
something does to them what the rest of the humans are doing to
themselves.

IAC, by 1140 or so, you\'ve got complete chaos from one end of known
space to the other.  Move the clock forward 50 years and you have
what *I* thought TNE was going to be...a dozen or more pocket
empires just starting to explore more than a couple of parsecs from
their center. 

I thought (still think) there would be a lot of potential in this
universe.

But you told us not to tell you if anyone else had done anything similar.

Look up HIWG CD in the archives. 
Latest ref is digest 756 (1999) and proceed from there. 
Though the entry suggests Bryan may be on holiday.
Alternatively look on the BITS website www.bits.org.uk.

Hmm. Larger - maybe (will have to hunt out my Alien Modules to check).
More Advanced - I believe that we have similar technologies and we are more
liable to advance than your static, conservative society...
Outfits - I cite the TML Great Old One Bruce Berry here "Embrace Fascism,
the uniforms are cool". Anyway, turbans aren\'t as great a style statement
as jackboots.


But, in the spirit of the enemy of my enemy being my friend - the
Confederation has suffered greatly from the expansionism of the Imperium.
Perhaps you could start a 6th Frontier War at the same time as we start the
2nd Great Patriotic War for the Liberation of Terra and the Solomani Race
from Vilani Enslavement?

ObTrav - If all goes well, one of our GenCon adventures should be based
around the players being Zhodani lost in the Imperium!

But AL at lower GTLs is stronger than the maximum Traveller Technology at
the same TL, ergo it needs to be limited in some way to give the same feel
as CT, MT, and T4.

I also have a teny problem with a laminate outperforming coherent bonded
superdense, but lets not go there.

The PPC can be either big-endian or little-endian IIRC. You tell it which
when it boots.

MacOS X will have a MacOS like GUI....

If you have a Mac with OS>7 check out the iCAB browser

and reports back non-compliances. It works for 68k and PPC but doesn\'t have
Javascript ready in this version of the browser. It does have Java through
Apples\' MRJ kit.

"Sky Rig" was the scenario - somewhere around WD57/58. A great scenario,
and I must have run it five or more times. Excellent way to give the

There\'s a lot of speculation that the plague that wiped out much of

Email to both list addresses is rejected by the qrc.com mail server with 
"Sorry, no mailbox here by that name. (#5.1.1)" messages.

No web site for the project can be found at www.qrc.com.

A global AltaVista search on "Traveller CD Project" results in only one 
(count it 1) match, which is a links page.  The link leads to a dead-end.

On a hunch, I punched up the project coordinator\'s homepage 
<http://members.aol.com/kagekiha/> and was taken to an old web site with 
a mass of broken links.  Not a mention about the Traveller CD Project.

I\'ve beamed off an email to <kagekiha@aol.com> and, well, it\'s been 15 
minutes and it hasn\'t bounced yet!  I guess that\'s a good sign.

At this point in time, either the Project has been classified by the CIA 
in the interests of national security, or it died a natural death.  I 
guess the latter.

Don\'t forget that IRIS was officially a \'variant\'. It kept showing up
because the author of IRIS, Chuck Gannon, was also the author of a lot of
the late MT stuff (like Hard Times, IIRC) and so he kept on using his
variant organization as chrome.

Personally, I deleted all references to IRIS, because I thought it was
silly. When one of my new players wanted to play an IRIS character I just
told him that it was a variant and I didn\'t use it, and that was that.

Why is the damage dependent on acceleration?  Relative velocity I can
understand, but the acceleration is meaningless (unless you integrate over
time, in which case you end up with velocity anyway).

Or are they assuming that a missile has only been flying for one turn, and
thus this is just a shorthand way of getting to velocity?

(As you may have gathered, I don\'t use the GT rules for space combat. Last
time I ran a space combat, back in the 1980s, I used the TSAR system.)

I would limit this bonus to Imperial Marine Commandos.  Other Marines are
likely to have collateral duties that would substantially cut into training
time. Shipboard Marines do security and gunnery duties, Imperial Guard
Marines spend a lot of time doing personal protection and ceremonial duties,
Starport guards, etc.

Hey, I posted the math on that _once_.  I\'m not doing it again!

(IIRC, I calculated that one CPU slot in a Traveller computer could
simultaneously run 250 Acrobat windows, thus using PDF to destroy 250
missiles per combat turn.)

This is nearly exactly what I have pictured and have designed for MTU. I
moved the date a little farther forward to 1483. I created a couple of
struggling pocket empires just emerging from the 2nd night. Known space is
about a 16 parsec diameter. (about two subsectors)

I had imagined the Imperium having collapsed, seeing as Hard Times brought
the safes down to 1-2 subsectors and many of the worlds between were
ravaged. It\'s hard to imagine expansion any time soon. I pictured a similiar
result to the end of the Rule of Man, another Long Night. (the 2nd Night) I
gave it 3 centuries to recover in the corner of space I\'m playing in.

That\'s about my take on it.  In Reavers\' Deep, after putting up with the 
Union of Harmony and Union of Purity idiots for long enough, listening to 
their Solomani supremicist rantings for centuries, the locals decided to 
finally stomp them out and have some peace and quiet for a change.  <grin>

Doncha mean Zhodani?  I *still* haven\'t figured out where Argent & the 
Zeritsu Empire are from in your game.

HT starts \'timing in\' in 1125.  No coincidence there that MTU is set in 1124, 
eh?  <grin>

Which is why I picked that setting to begin with.  <grin>

I don\'t have the droyne aliens supplement, but none of the references I\'ve

Except I\'ve seen a number of references to Droyne Jump drives being very
highly sought after.

Certainly not PC\'s who study the Droyne very much, or are at all familiar with
the theory. The droyne who survived the Final War were the ones NOT IN Ancient
owned systems.

Remember...the Ancients were Droyne, but not all the Droyne were Ancients.
That was only Gramps and his children. The strongholds of the Ancients were
mostly wiped out and depopulated, all that\'s left are the scattered Ancient
sites. The droyne worlds of today don\'t have much, if anything in the way of
Ancient technology because they either destroyed it or never had it. 

The Droyne, as a race, want to live quiet, unmolested lives, not venturing
very far out from their homeworlds. A very good survival strategy during the
Final War, one that would have gotten deeply, DEEPLY engrained in the racial
psyche, much like the the fear of uncontrolled technology the Ancient warbots
instilled in the Vilani.

Just drop an archive onto the shortcut and it unpacked it no muss no fuss no

And it\'s free. Best port of a Mac program to PC I\'ve ever seen.

A), 01/IX/1201
KEYWORDS: DULINOR THE BLACK, MUSICAL TRENDS, RAVE reported by Derek 
Stanley 
Dulinor the Black and his entourage ascended the stage of the Yankermon Sportsplex to the cheers 
of a massed audience of over fifteen thousand screaming supporters. Sporting his customary tousled 
hairstyle, and clad in his ceremonial toga, Strephon\'s assassin haild the crowd as strains of "The 
Clarion," the Ilelish Federation anthem, thundered throughout the darkened arena. As he coolly 
surveyed the massed thousands below, the would-be Emperor has but one question to pose to his 
loyal followers arrayed below: "YANKERMON, ARE YOU READY TO RAVE?!" 
No, it\'s not a nightmare returned from a dark and discredited era, it\'s Fija\'s newest pop sensation: 
Dulinor the Black and the Stormtroopers of Ilelish. Known mainly for it\'s frontman, Dulinor the Black 
(the former Ned Whiskus, who bears and uncanny resemblance to the former Imperial leader), the 
band claims preeminence as the leader of a new Fijan musical movement known as "Rave." 
Rave, which centers on the unusual, the iconoclastic, and the outrageous, appears to have taken over 
Fijan youth culture almost overnight. "It\'s as if something was just waiting about in and embryonic 
stage," declared Dr. D.D. Demented, a prominent music critic and commentator of the Fijan cultural 
scene, "Poof! Just add water, and there it was." 
If the ultimate aim of Rave is to shock, then last night\'s performance certainly acheived it. The set, 
which lasted approximately 90 minutes alternated between blasts of cacophonic music punctuated by 
chants from Dulinor of "Crash Lucan!" and "I did it for the Good of all Humanity!," and an elaborate 
tableau acted out by Dulinor and his bandmates. Giant screens placed strategically about the 
auditorium broadcast cleverly edited speeches by the real Dulinor, which often drowned out the 
ranting coming from the stage. Sound limits sampled from inside the building exceeded safety limits for 
human hearing at least twice, prompting Enos Weatherby, leader of the Parents\' League for Fijan 
Decency to denounce the event as a, "dastardly sonic attack on our vulnerable youth!"
One concert-goer, interviewed after the event, summed up the music in this way; "It\'s a bit bland, but 
its got a good beat, and you can dance to it." 

COALINFONET, CLASS: NEWSREPORT, DISTRIBUTION, ENT/GEN, AUTHORITY 
CIN/AUBAINE, BRUSMAN, AUBAINE (0738/AUBAINE, A78A884-C), 21/IV/1202 
KEYWORDS: DULINOR THE BLACK, ITHKLUR MARINES, RAVE, RIOT reported by 
Derek Stanley. 
Dulinor the Black and the Stormtroopers of Ilelish have canceled their "Genocide" Tour following a 
close encounter with a trio of off-duty Ithklur Marines at their debut concert last night in the 
Brusman\'s Lampton Civic Arena. Currently, both "Dulinor," and his bassist, "Margaret Lucan," are 
hiding somewhere in Brusman following the ruckus which resulted in severe damage to the auditorium, 
and necessitatied the deployment of the Brusman Port Authority Police SWAT team. Contact with 
the press was made by their manager, Barney Lkath, who refused to meet physically with reporters, 
and instead held the press conference via hololink from an undesclosed location. 
The disturbance began approximately halfway through the band\'s opening number, "Annihilation," 
when three enraged Ithklur leapt onto the stage and attempted to seize Dulinor. A free-for-all melee 
ensued between the Ithklur and the rest of the band, which effectively ended the performance and 
sparked off a riot as dozens of angry fans began trashing the arena. Dulinor and Margaret Lucan, who 
managed to slip off the stage in the confusion soon found themselves hunted through the dark warren 
of service tunnels beneath the stage by two of the Ithklur, while the third grabbed a fire axe and began 
to methodically destroy the band\'s equipment. 
The Ithklur pursuit of the controversial entertainers only ceased after a liason with members of the 
Brusman SWAT team, assured them that Dulinor would be apprehended and prosecuted posthaste. 
Interviewed shortly thereafter by reporters, the Ithklur explained that they had won tickets to the 
concert through a local radio promotion, and had been unaware as to the nature of the act before 
arriving at the arena. They also appeared puzzled as to why Coatlition society would tolerate an 
individual whom they termed as "a vile war criminal" making a living as a popular entertainer and 
media icon. 
At present, Hive Federation officials have been unavailable for comment.

It\'s moving along slowly, we just had the \'It\'s a new month, where are you
now\' emails, but Bryan is going on or is on vacation or some hiatus until September.

Definitely tell Bryan about the digests stuff (actually he may be reading it
now, he is on the TML) it\'ll definitely be a good addition to the next HWIG
(or TML) CD he\'s planning.

There are two projects: the HWIG CD, aka the TML CD, which is a compilation of
fan-produced stuff, and the Traveller CD which is a project to scan and ocr
all the GDW (afaik it\'s only GDW) Traveller material published. 

Bryan may have a couple HWIG CD\'s laying around for purchase. At one point in
time he was considering annual updates to that one.

Seriously, I\'ve been using Aladdin Expander for a long time and its great.
In my business I receive artwork via email all the time. Some of my Mac
customers like to Stuffit their files. I think AOL even does it to Mac
users. Because of AOL, I was forced to find a solution to uncompressing
stuffit files. Aladdin Expander has been a great tool.

I would like to point out that GT:Alien Races 1 on p 125 states: "The crew
used a modified cutter ... and war-surplus combat armor and battledress to
descend into its (the gas giant Sheol\'s) clouds where Zhodani records showed
the ship had gone down."

I would hate to face those environmental conditions of temperature, pressure
and radiation in a suit of battledress that could be penetrated by a hand
weapon.

Except that the Zhunastu School of Contact is totally nonsensical

Well forgive me for sounding dumb, Rob, but doesn\'t velocity add to the
mass of a projectile?  Don\'t you add a projectile\'s kinetic force to the
damage upon impact?

Not sure what you mean. There *is* plenty of *good stuff* in First In.
Actually, a huge portion of the book consists of a system for designing star
systems. It\'s basically a much expanded Book 6: Scouts.

However, I don\'t believe there are any rules for warfare in First In. It\'s
all about the scouts.

Well Bruce, according to Knightfall:

"Perhaps the most startling discovery of all that awaits the PCs is this:
The Shimmering City was not built by the Ancients, and actually predates the
Ancients by at least 250,000 years -- the artifacts from it can be dated to
around -600,000 according to the Imperial calendar-which definitely is
before the Ancients\' period!

"As it turns out, the city was built by a mysterious race which the Ancients
themselves were studying, and from which the Ancients borrowed some
technology.

"The name of this very old, mysterious race is not known, but a few Imperial
archaeologists have begun to suspect this race\'s existence. This handful of
archaeologists have coined a name for this new, previously unknown
starfaring race: the Primordials." (Knightfall, pg. 67 sidebar)

just had a trip to my local FLGS (Best Books & Games in Liverpool,UK) and
picked up what I thought was 2nd edition Imperium, and the Spinward Marches
Campaign, both mint (Imperium had no counters punched out!). Imperium was
£20 ie $30 so a little more than Marc\'s $20 sets, and SMC was £15 (22 USD).

Anyway, this set me thinking - someone mentioned that there were two
versions of Imperium (a second edition which had a paper map and the
original). I have a hard board GDW printing, plus a hard board CGC
printing. Does this mean that there are actually 3 versions? The CGC
version, then two GDW copies?

Anyway, on another front, the owner, Dave Frost, asked me to say to the
people who have written to him that he will be contacting them, but his
email is down at the moment. When I looked he still had most MT stuff
(including Digests and SOpM), a lot of CT and some TNE.

True. Any version of the Mac OS will have a front-end GUI that is pretty
much the same as it always has been. They aren\'t going to make major
changes since Mac users like what they have.

The confusion comes from the use of the letter X, which in the case of
"Mac OS X" means that they haven\'t definitely determined the number that
they will assign to the next version of their OS. This is not the same
X as we find in Unix / Linux "X-Windows".

This kind of confusion can be fun. I run a computer-specialty bookstore.
The shortform "OOP" has two radically different meanings: "Object Oriented
Programming" and "Out Of Print". We have to be very careful to make sure
that the context is clear when we use "OOP" for anything... :)

Droyne have quite a bit of psionic power.  Droyne and chirpers have a form
of invisibility (effects the mind of the viewer, not the light waves
themselves), droyne have a wide array of other powers, including telepathy
and teleporation.
But this stuff is explained in the supplement.  You might want to get it if
you plan on doing anything with droyne as a focus.  GT supposedly has a
droyne book in the works too.

True.  This seems a big discrepency.  I\'ve seen the interdiction explained
as psionic prejudice based, and I\'ve seen the jump drives references too.

From what I understand the droyne in most systems got their by being
servents of the Children and Grandchildren.  By definition almost any
droyne world would have had an Ancients site somewhere (but likely totally
destroyed).  And the droyne hold Ancient artifacts in superstitious awe and
fear, so even if some sites survived, the droyne wouldn\'t go anywhere near
them.  So I agree to some extent.  But if you have droyne on a world you
had to have an Ancient\'s base.

You have to remember the Decline as well.  Virtually all droyne worlds lost
the ability to caste, essentially reverting to near animals (chirpers).
That would be a big break in their psyche, not to mention their past.  The
reintroduction of coynes and society by Grandfather is the only thing that
saved them from extinction.  Droyne live the life Grandfather planned for
them, so they might want to live quiet lives, or they might just be living
quiet lives until they are told otherwise.  Remember those quiet, pastorial
droyne have an entire biological caste devoted to war, warriors who can
become invisible at will, teleport and read your mind.  And usually have a
pretty respectable tech level.  Maybe they\'re just waiting...

Yeah, and I picture the same happening all over the Rim. 

To be honest, I\'ve always ignored the K\'kree and Hivers, and not
paid much attention to the Aslan either.  I suspect the problem with
a big long breakup is that these groups would move into the vacuum.
And to be fair, having a deux e machina <sp> like Virus to savage
these surrounding groups is a good way to handle the situation from
a post-event game play POV.  I don\'t want to start a Virus debate,
here.  You can love it, hate it, believe it or disbelieve it as far
as I\'m concerned.  To me it was just an equal opportunity wreaking
ball that was used to collapse *everybody* and their neighbor.

Yes, and the Zeristu are NOT the Zhodani of MTU.

Astrophysically or culturally?

Well, it\'s been several thousand years since MTU\'s Imperium died,
and that might or might not have been the 3rd Imperium, IAC.  IMTU,
jump maps don\'t correspond to real space maps one to one so many of
the spacial relationships have changed...if they ever *were* the
same.  ;->

Everyone went through the "madness" where virtually all knowledge
was lost thousands of years ago.  So, technology and culture has
been relearned along arbitrary paths. Argent and Zeristu correspond
to no standard Traveller culture, and neither does Mark, Muan Gwi,
Montrose or Newton.  Now, they *might* correspond to my impressions
of various Earth cultures during different eras, but I\'m not going
to say more than that.  ;-p

Yes, you are right, it should have taken longer. 

IMTU I wreaked things even more throughly, no safes...everything
ravaged, and it took several *thousand* years to recover.  A
*really* long night.  ;-> Out of it are coming different cultures
*and* different technologies.  To these folks, the Third Imperium
(if that\'s what it was) is the Ancients, or one set of many Ancients
actually ,and the stuff of myth and story.

Would you advise a CT type guy to go ahead and spring for First In, or
should I try to get a copy of Scouts? Or are there other sources? I am
looking to expand my home rules system building, and would like to know more
about the Steller Data rules, as I want to include varient Jump Drive
systems that rely on star type/size ala MiGE Alderson Drives. I know, pure
unadulterated heresy. I dislike all alien races utilizing the same type of
technology. Hence I shall include relativistic drives, Jump Drives, Warp
Field Generators, Psionic Teleportation, Inter-Steller Gates, etc. I could
base it off of RW data, but Traveller data is already based off of the RW,
and would give a common point of reference to my home rules. Would like some
data on orbital dynamics, the "Green Zone", etc. as well.

I know binary stars can revolve around a common center of mass, but can a
companion star orbit the primary like a super-sized Jupiter on fire? With or
without fries, hold the cheese, please. What of trinary systems? I can\'t see
all three stars revolving around a single common center of gravity, does one
automatically orbit the first two? Can two stars orbit a primary? What are
the % chances of each type of system? Do some steller types preclude others
in multiple star systems? Could a singularity be part of a systems "family"?
I seem to recall some science article hypothesising a black-hole orbiting
some star "out there".

The Web has many "gearhead" sites, deckplans, Library Data, campaign
settings, etc. Noting this, I have stripped my upcoming website of all my
deckplans and other material that seems to be covered on the Web, and am
focusing on Sectors, Alternative Rules, Xenobiology, Links, and Traveller
oriented Icons/Clip Art. Scout type material would fit well.

A significant portion of the book contains information for the generation of
stellar systems and a barebones approach to generating cultures for the
worlds created. This stuff is useful for just about any version of
Traveller, not to mention any other game where space travel is a reality.

A large portion of the book details the structure of the IISS. This builds
on Book 6: Scouts.

There are some "GURPS only" rules, but to tell you the truth I think that
it\'s one of the best supplements I\'ve seen for Traveller in *any*
incarnation.

I\'ve also recently picked up Far Trader. I haven\'t gotten a chance to really
explore it at length, but it\'s another book that has (in my opinion)
cross-genre appeal.

This is a new campaign for me and is still in the developmental stages. I\'ll

I\'m thinking near the Solomani/Imperial/Aslan Border. Possibly Daibei,
Zarushagar or Ilelish. I suppose it would be reasonable for a clan of Aslan
to get up to Ilelish in 300 years... Their\'d probably be a lot of Aslan
expansion during the fall of the 3I. See... their I go again. Always

While taking a break from working on the Keith \'Lost Supplements\' Books
this afternoon (yes, still working on them!) and after noting James
Kundert\'s (GypsyComet) post  regarding his efforts in locating some of the
early missing bundles, I decided to wade through my old files and see if I
myself had any of the early bundles still sitting on my hard-drive. Here is
what I found:

Bundles 1-111 (The first post to the first bundle is dated July 1, 1987)
Bundles 124-183
Bundles 212-239
Bundles 268-278

The \'gaps\' are from the various times in the early years when I subscribed
to the TML in the non-digest mode. Anyway - if you want/need any/all of
these early TML bundles, let me know and we can figure out how to get them
two you in a reasonable manner (total size is in the 5-6 meg zipped
neighborhood ).

Cordially,

It *sounds* like you *really* wanna place the campaign in Reavers\' Deep at 
the tail end of the Reavers Era.  RD is just rimward of Ilelish, just 
spinward of Daibei, and across the corner from Zarushagar.  If fitted into a 
standard Imperial \'Domain\', it would be the 4th sector.  <grin>

From what I hear, in M:0, the 3I is pretty much the best-armed bunch around.  
Nobody else is even in their league hardly.  The only thing that slowed them 
down in their expansion was the fact that they had to take time out between 
campaigns of conquest to integrate the new territories into what they already 
had.  In TNE, humaniti had already created its successor species, Virus, and 
had to try and win space back from it.

One thing that does come through as being on the brighter side is the 
indomitable human spirit.  The same thing that gets me when I watch ID4 and 
see the prezz\'s speech just as he heads for his fighter.  "We will *not* go 
quietly into the night, we will *not* go down without a fight, we *will* 
survive..."  Great stuff.

That I kinda noticed, but the PCs in your Akus Moby campaign are coming out a 
hundred years or so after humans got back into space in a big way.  Kinda a 
TNE: TNG sorta thing.  <grin>

If it uses the standard Xwindows API, then when they port it to Linux, the secondary port will be relatively trivial.  Not trivial, *relatively* trivial, compared to the port to Linux.

Plenty of evidence, actually.  Seven major strains of plague with no genetic ties to anything seen on Earth at the time.  And some of the plagues were mutagenic.  Some seriously *nasty* stuff.

One thing to bare in mind about Ancient technology  look-and-feel
is that there were no standards:

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    The most striking aspect of the Ancient technology is not
    its high level (though this is certainly  dramatic),  but
    its diversity.  Of the hundreds of  Ancient  sites  which
    have been excavated and analyzed, each appears to express
    a  different  approach  to   the   problems   solved   by
    technology.  It would  be  easy  to  take  each  site  as
    originating from a different  cultural  or  technological
    background, as the  first  Vilani  spacefarers  theorized
    them to be.

    It appears that each site involved  the  near  total  re-
    invention  of  the  most   basic   building   blocks   of
    technology.  One site might use familiar screw fasteners,
    while another would depend  on  adhesives  for  the  same
    task; still others  would  use  rivets,  or  interlocking
    ellipsoids, or simple plastic clasps.  While one  sites\'s
    computers and electronics show evidence of  depending  on
    silicon  chip  circuits,  another  performed   the   same
    functions with fiber optics,  still  another  used  fluid
    dynamics, and yet another channelled heat transfer.  Even
    writing, data formats, recording  formats,  systems,  and
    standards  vary  between  sites.  While   the   high-tech
    equipment discovered is fully compatible within  a  site,
    rarely do artifacts from different sites show any ability
    to function together.

                                                     GDW 1985

Thus the ship and floating facility  featured  in  "Secret Of The
Ancients" seem to be organic in appearance,  while  at  the  same
time the city on Albert (a moon of  Victoria/Lanth)  featured  in
JTAS 2 is descibed as being of cast stone and almost crystalline.

So if you are  going  to  create  artwork  featuring  an  Ancient
starship ... anything will do.  Canon is there is no canon!

Within the context of Traveller the term does have a specific
canon definition:

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Merchant Cruisers:  A generic  term  applied  to  vessels
    specifically assigned to independent missions, the  prime
    objective of which is market discovery  and  acquisition,
    either in isolation or in competion with  other  merchant
    operators.  Design parameters for  such  vessels  usually
    include a high level of weaponry and auxiliary  boats  in
    proportion to  their  cargo  capacity  and  all  possible
    back-up systems, along with high structural integrity.

I was meaning, are there any rules in it that show what scouts do in wartime.

The Hivers would be sitting back watching everything, of course, as an 
experiment in Manipulation.  The K\'Kree would be busy moving into the vacuum 
created in Hinterworlds, Old Expanses, and Ley Sectors.  They\'d take it slow, 
of course, to make sure they could whack out any carnivores they found there 
and to make sure the omnivores they took over behaved themselves.

The Aslan are a different story.  4 clans made up the signatories of the 
Peace of Ftahalr, and while Solomani movements in Reavers\' Deep and Dark 
Nebula were technical violations of the Peace, they tried holding the line 
against the ihaeti to keep them pouring into Deneb instead of into Reavers\' 
Deep, where they probably would have become a unifying force for humaniti.

But you\'re right about Virus being a one size fits all wrecking ball.

Sorry. Sloppy writing on my part - I was using \'Gs\' (incorrectly) as a shorthand
for relative velocity. It says "relative velocity" in the book. Also the
reference I gave should have been GT page 169.

Oops!

That one, damfino. It\'s got what looks like a fighter attached, and 6,
possibly seven turrets, maybe those side things are bay weapons, yet it looks
pretty small, 150-200 DT...looks like an SDB to me. Ask Loren, he\'ll know who

All bodies (stars & planets) orbit around a common center of mass.
However, when one body is much more massive than the other, that common
center will be close to or within the more massive body, and it looks like
it is stationary as the other body orbits it.  An example is the Earth-Moon
system - if you watched them from above, you\'d see the Earth is \'wobbling\'
off-center around a point <mumble> km beneath the it\'s surface, on the side
facing the moon.

However, the mass of main-sequence stars don\'t vary all that much (0.1 to
10 solar masses), and binaries tend to be quite close in mass to each
other.  A third star would have to be far enough out to orbit the inner
pair\'s center of mass.  If it\'s too close the arrangement would be
unstable.  A 4-star system would be two binary pairs orbit a common center
of mass.

First In has everything that B6 has plus pretty much everything that World
Builders Handbook has, so from an economy standpoint, FI is _definitely_ the
better deal. Plus, it\'s in print.

It\'s also quite well done. IMHO.

For variant drive technology, though, you\'ll have to find a copy of FFS or
FFS2; that\'s where that stuff is explained. Gurps Space has that kind of
stuff, too.

You\'ll have to be careful though...Jump Drive is sort of like the internal
combustion engine technology for cars...there\'s a reason everyone uses pretty
much one kind of technology...you\'ll get occasional designs that are
different, but they have to provide very significant advantages for them to be
other than curiosities. And if they offer those kinds of advantages, they\'ll
rapidly replace jump drives...

Velocity increasing mass only happens at relativistic speeds -- not
something usually encountered in a Traveller space battle.

Velocity _does_ matter for kinetic energy: Ek = 1/2 * mass * velocity ** 2

The problem I had was that the original poster (forget who) said that the
damage for a missile was related to "relative acceleration". After finally
digging out GT I see that it\'s related to relative _velocity_, which is
what it should be, although the relationship is linear (which isn\'t quite
correct but I can accept it as a reasonable gaming simplification, seeing
as so many gamers seem to find arithmetic hard during the game).

Further background: "cruiser" originally meant a ship intended to cruise -
that is, stay out of port for a long time. In Traveller the term cruiser is
sometimes used in this sense (eg. merchant cruiser) and sometimes in the
sense of a well armers, agile, lightly armoured military ship.

Yes, we know this, but when do these facts become known in the
Imperium?  I\'m not at all clear on some of this myself.

That nit was well-picked.  I developed a blind spot about Adventure 4 as
soon as I got to the part about the jump torpedos, and still suppress
everything about it almost twenty years later.

In keeping with our nitpicking tradition, I\'ll note that it\'s "free
rein", as in holding an animal\'s control strap loosely.  "Free reign" in
this context suggests absolute rule by the artists (not part of the
canon UPP).  In my Traveller universe, at least, visiting such a world
would be, let\'s say, a little trying.

His armour was maroon, with a lime-green helmet, to avoid unwanted
attention from IRIS.

"Very fashionable", the Ithklur thought, as he adjusted his Santa Claus
cap.  "I wonder if he likes Corn Dogs".

Well at least _we_ never had a Long Night.  Even if civilisation were to
fail in one area, it would prosper in another.  If your Imperium fell, it
would be a disaster for you - and an opportunity for us.

The irony is, of course, _some_ humans would prosper - those who are
friends of the Vargr!

As I mentioned above in Vargr-voice:  unless they get taken out too, a
\'Long Night\' for Imperial humans is no big deal to the Vargr.  Some
cross-border trade will be lost, but opportunities for raiding and
extortion would increase.

That\'s why something like Virus would be necessary.  The other potential
plot devices, like the Empress Wave or Sparklers or whatever could also be
used, provided that the affect the Vargr too.  The supposed psionic effects
of the Empress Wave wouldn\'t necessarily do much to push over Vargr
civilisation, but it wasn\'t meant to in the TNE setting, where it had
already mostly been done by Virus.

But you would have to push over the Vargr, Aslan and whatnot as well.  Even
in terms of kind-of human societies, the Julian Protectorate would be still
there, probably with some Brzk and Vilani faction loyalists dotted around.

The resulting societies wouldn\'t be quite the same, but interstellar
civilisations _would_ exist at the fringes of the Imperium.  How long it
would take them to spread into the Imperial core is anyone\'s guess, but as
long as there\'s something to trade for or steal, people will try to do it. 
Even Virus didn\'t prevent traders/raiders from operating out of the Regency
and Vargr splinters into the Wilds.

Hmm.  I seem to be becoming the TML\'s "Token Vargr".  This is a worry,
since I\'m also designing my Civil War game.  I\'m obviously going to have to
place it in one of the coreward sectors, where I can keep practicing my
Vargr-voice.  Maybe Lishun - not much has been written about it.

        Hi, Mike!
        I like it.  The layout is good and I like the crest in the
foreground like that.  What package are you using?

Isn\'t it probably an exploding Modular Cutter in front of the Lab ship?  Well, okay it could be a ship\'s boat too, but that\'s not the one on page 3 of GT.

When I said "no safes...everything ravaged," I meant everything!
Aslan, Vargr, K\'kree, Hivers...you name it.  IMTU, the stories about
"the madness" talk about a galaxy wide disaster where all races
fought to the death, where machines and even space itself rose up
against life, and when it was all over *everyone* was thrown back to
the stone age.  Whether the stories are hyperbole or not, is up to
the characters to figure out...if they so desire.  ;-> 

BTW, there are scattered groups of Vargr here and there in the area
they PC\'s are familar with, and rumors of more coreward.

have to start somewhere :)  I started with trueSpace v2 for about $350
versus the $1800 (+ plugins) that I currently use in Lightwave v5.6.

I\'ll be perfectly honest in the nit-pick department (I am with Andy and he
is with me after all :).  I think the turret is too tall and the turret base
too high as well.  With a hard wedge like the Sulieman and the ship you have
here, you want the top of the turret base slightly above flush at it\'s
highest point (the rear).  Then you want the turret to be slightly less than
half a flattened sphere.  This gives it a decent streamlined performance
when entering the atmosphere.  Along with the streamlining goes "burn
mapping" on the texture maps.  It adds an extra dimension of "reality"
(kinda\' funny eh considering the topic?) to the model.  The manuever jets
would be next.  The jet nozzles should be black holes with a lighter color
around it, not the other way around.  They also need to be balanced.  If
you\'re useing a single front jet as opposed to dual, then it needs to be
centered instead of offset.  If it\'s offset like you show than you\'ll impart
an un-wanted roll when useing them.

I\'ve been working a little bit with Andy Akins (the LF-78 pics at his site
are the result) in e-mail useing Lightwave.  With any luck I\'ll soon be
doing teh same with Mark Cook :)  I\'ve never used Raydream, though from what
little I\'ve seen it appears to have enough texture control to get you at
least in the neighborhood.  If you want I can forward you the mini texture
tutorial that I did for Andy when he first started.  I -think- I still have
that at work :)

Best,
Jesse

p.s.  I\'m sending an edited version of this to the TML as well minus the
nit-picks.

Seriously, Mike, you\'ve got the basis of a truly 5 star site starting there.

I thought that X was 10 in Roman Numerals, as OSX is due out after OS9

Actually, in MO the 3I starts expanding after it has concluded its wars
with the Chanestin Kingdom (rimward), and the Interstellar Confederacy
(from the Dag top Spinward side of Core). The Chanestin lasted longer IIRC,
but the IC seriously threatened the nascent Imperium.

They\'re still making OS9 for the Macs?  *COOL*!!!  I used to use it on my CoCos way back when.

Apparently, according to current observations, there should be twice as
many brown dwarfs as all other types of stars put together. 

So if you want to add them to system generation, you could do it like
this: 

1-2	use standard star table
3-6	Brown Dwarf

Not only has "Type L" been suggested for brown dwarfs with surface
temps in the range 2000-1400 K, but there\'s even talk of a type T for
cooler ones (clear down to Jupiter/Saturn temps).

No idea what the relative frequency of the two types should be. 

One "good" thing if we include them in system generation. It\'d get the
frequency of *other* stars back down to something reasonable.

Actually I am thinking that the variants will be seriously less useful than
.Jump. Utilized by races the 3I considers "Minor", and in most cases
significantly slower. The other factor will be *where* I set the campaign. I
plan on locating the sector that will serve as a stage far from 3I space,
with campaign introduction being a misjump.

Wow, a double binary. How common are these? I had a friend tell me binaries
were the most common, folowed by singular stars, then trinary. He didn\'t

Bad news...this sounds like you downloaded the files in ascii not binary
format. 

Try changing the .z to .Z (but that doesn\'t matter, I think, on Windows
systems) Expander may be thinking they\'re some variant of gzip files (.gz)
rather than compress files (.Z) (in unix, case matters)

If you still get the error message, then it might be the ascii not binary
thing. That might have been why Winzip choked on them in the first place, too.

If you\'re using a ftp utility, like WSFTP, to download them, make sure that
the \'binary\' option is selected.

I know I\'ve successfully expanded compress files with expander on my PC at work.

Actually only if I *do* the Spinward Marches or other 3I zone. I only play
right now, and that mostly around the Sword Worlds. I have arbitrated other
Sci-Fi games, but not Traveller. Even before I was introduced to traveller,
my home rules usually shifted the games to a more Travelleresque feel. Or
Aliens, with a dash of Niven\'s Known Universe.

Well, come to think of it, perhaps I should say longer? Nothing travels

Actually it\'s Mac OS X (ten) because OS 9 has been around for years already.
It\'s a real-time operating system used in embedded systems, and IIRC, was last
used in consumer systems as the OS for TI and Tandy computers (wasn\'t the CoCo
an OS9 system?)

You can find the company that makes it on the web somewhere, there\'s a fair
following for it, and it\'s been ported to several different chip
architectures, IIRC.

Whats going to be interesting, from my point of view is if there\'s going to be
some way to hack OSX into allowing a regular X-Windows session, either as an
alternate full-screen, or even cooler, as a window, a la Virtual PC. 

The latter should be simple...there are a number of Mac X-Windows clients out
right now. That ought to make it work in the short term, until people have
wailed on the Mac GUI libs (the Carbon libraries) for a while to get an
\'Xwindows\' lib that has the Mac GUI.

_That_ is going to start eating Linuxes lunch in the consumer
market...allegedly, OSX will run on Imacs (Apple has stated that it is
targeted for \'modern\' macs with G3 processors: Imacs and B&W G3\'s) Linux runs
quite happily on iMacs, so there\'s no major problem as far as processor power
or memory, etc.

gcc is already ported  so all the current library files for linux can, in
theory, be ported. (OSX server was widely proclaimed as not having a freely
available development system, when gcc was shipping all along. It was just on
the second CD which had Apache and suchlike. This means that the CD\'s that
come with OSX should provide some _interesting_ browsing ... don\'t just
install it and put \'em away!)

Linux will always be good for low cost solutions, but from a consumer
standpoint, a system that offers both all the usability advantages of the Mac
and all the stability advantages of Linux is going to rock, _particularly_
since the underpinning OS is still open source. If someone makes Back Orifrice
for Mac OSX, at least the lower level holes can be plugged relatively quickly.

Dragging it back to Traveller, this does represent a first step towards the
kind of computing model common im Traveller, that programs can run just about
anywhere on any system.

For what it\'s worth.. .I saw this article too, and it inspired me to do a 
little
more research on brown dwarfs.  When I\'m done I\'ll release some optional
rules compatible with First In to take them into account.

The astute observer will notice that First In, as it stands, doesn\'t generate
gas giants much larger than Jupiter.  This is no worse than earlier system-
generation rule sets, but it isn\'t satisfactory because it doesn\'t allow for
super-Jupiters of the kind we *know* exist.  Hopefully when I\'m done with
the current project we\'ll be able to deal with super-Jovians and brown
dwarfs in a reasonable manner.

Hmmmm.  I\'m a little leery of this.  One of the most common complaints
I\'ve gotten about First In so far is that it\'s difficult to generate a system
containing an Earthlike world at random.  This is mostly because it\'s
almost impossible to generate an Earthlike world near a primary star
of class K5 or lower -- and that\'s the majority of all stars.  Making
two-thirds of all randomly-generated stars brown dwarfs might be more
realistic but it would be even less playable.

It might make sense to allow *companion* stars to be brown dwarfs,
of course. . .

Anyway, I\'m open to suggestions as to how to set up these rules.

Stutterwarp drives work best in very low gravity gradients. In 2300 AD the
actual speed depends on the \'warp\' rating of the drive, and is equal to 1
Lightyear/day /warp rating. The big thing with Stutterwarp drives is that they
build up a charge on drive components that needs to be discharged regularly,
in a gravity well, or the drive is damaged. This is nasty, as the drive puts
out a huge amount of radiation as it disintegrates.

The practical limit, at 2300AD levels is 7.7 light years. (approximately jump 2)

It already exists for NeXTStep (aka Rhapsody). We had it on our NeXT

Well, there are a variety of solutions, my first thought is Ancients nudging
planets around. Another would be clerical error, or compromise in notation.
Perhaps if there is no other explanation it could be some as-yet-unrevealed
Primordial project.

TNE really played fast and loose with this.  They changed the rating from
LY/day to Parsecs/day and made the charge limit optional.

At some of the higer tech levels, TL-17, I was able to design a 3000ton
Frigate with a rating of 19...She could cover two subsectors in a day...

A couple of notes:
- -the density of brown dwarfs is pretty poorly known, in spite of recent nice
work
by the 2MASS people; I wouldn\'t be sure as yet that they\'re "twice as common"
as normal stars - error bars are pretty big. If you do want them to be common,
a good Traveller approach would just be to assume that every empty hex has
a brown dwarf in it...

Brown dwarfs and super-jovian planets probably aren\'t the same thing; it\'s
reasonable to maintain a distinction between them, with brown dwarfs being
generated by the star/binary star generating process and jovians (up to maybe
5-10 jupiter masses) being generated by the planet-generating process (which
is pretty much what happens in real life.) Also, because of selection effects,
our
ideas about how common super-jovian planets are are very very very fuzzy.

        Hi, Jon....
        As a suggestion, simply increase the odds of a given hex containing
a star...  browns are almost as useless as empty space, the way I understand
it.    So, your stelar population increases, but the ratio of useful stars
doesn\'t degrade.  Purely off the cuff suggestion.

        While I have never thought about it, you could handwave a TL15
soap-bubble like membrane that allows the vessels to pass through at a
couple of m/sec velocity and contains the atmosphere.

Well, looking through FF&S2, I can\'t find any screens that have such a
function.  I suppose that one could rig tractor/repulsor fields to allow
a bay to be open to space while retaining atmosphere.  The tricky part
would be to modulate the field so that a ship could exit the bay, while
the atmosphere remains in place.  Under FF&S2, this solution would
probably be TL-16 or higher, as repulsors don\'t appear in FF&S2 until
that TL.

Of course, black globe generators would be unsuitable, as the gas
molecules in the atmosphere would interact with the screen, thus
charging the screen to overload (see FF&S2, pg. 57, for a brief
discussion).

Naturally, grav plates would be able to provide gravity within the bay. 
I would suggest a gradient, with gravity increasing as the ship moves
away from the bay port.  That way, the ship\'s controls can compensate
gradually to the artificial gravity, and therefore won\'t slam into the
deck just inside the bay.

No force fields, at least not at *3I* TL (CT). Just who the doodles were

One thing I forgot to mention:  while FF&S lists repulsor technology as
TL-16, High Guard allows anti-missile repulsor bays at TL-10.  Perhaps
T4 assumes that useful repulsor technology requires a finer level of
control than can be achieved at TL-10.  If this is the case, one may be
able to extrapolate that a "simple" repulsor field (which repels gaseous
molecules, while allowing macroscopic artifacts ["ships"] to pass
freely) could be built at TL-14 or TL-15.

I wouldn\'t want to use an electromagnetic field for this; IMHO, there
would be too much chance of zapping the ship as it passes through.

But when the ship leaves, would the internal atmosphere of the ship be
effected?

I had this thought a while ago concerning a cruise ship design I was
toying with. I had thought about a feild covered promanade. However, I
eventually dropped the idea. Here\'s my logic, may be warped but here
goes.

Canon has various references to "domed cities" on vacc or hostile
environment worlds. Yet nowhere in Canon (that I could find!) is a
refernce to a feild covered city. Therefore there is no such feild in
the OTU. Since it would  be more useful in city construction than a
rigid dome, if it was available it would have been mentioned at lest
once.

I know, I know, it\'s not a "real" answer, and doesn\'t really "prove" it
one way or the other, but it worked for me.

haven\'t seen any star charts for Reaver\'s Deep or Daibei sectors anyways. I
wanted to have a clan of Aslan in the local region and thought this would be
the best area for it. The Aslan could easily penetrate deeper into Imperial
Territory after HT. Zarushagar is probably too ravaged for what I want to
portray, but it is a good border for lack of contact and future exploration.
Undercover SolSec agents might be intersting... maybe Solomani scouts
exploring the Old Imperium come across these worlds and send agents in to
learn more... I\'m basically just using the "galaxy" maps found in the MT/HT
books as a basis for where everything is/was. Actual world names and
locations don\'t really matter to me. I\'d much rather make them up as to how
I want/need them rather than being confined.  I never was much of a fan for
Vilani names anyways... I like words I can pronounce. ;)

I\'ll make star charts and library data and post it on the web as it becomes

infamous Xen Xanfried) got a hold on an Edict 97 and Edict 101 (Imp Warrant

you need GNUzip, not PKzip; stuffit doesn\'t do tar or gzip.

How you know what you need to unzip  the most coomon unix archive files:
.z	GNU Zip
.gz	GNU zip
.tar	Untar (*n*x Tape ARchive)
.tar.z	GNUzip and untar
.tgz	GNUzip and untar
.tar.gz	GNUzip and untar

those last three endings are often refferred to as "tarballs".

had to learn all this when tring to get MacBSD68K running... never got it
running (all my macs were too new). There are decoders for tar and gz for
almost all platforms.

it is, but there isn\'t supposed to be a MacOS 9. As for the nature of MacOS
X, it is based off of a cross between Next and MacOS and A/UX, using bits

The individual texture elements can be combined in some pretty interesting
ways, but they seem to work best on organic surfaces. Of course, the big
advantage of POV-Ray is that it\'s free ;)

It really helps when you\'re an impoverished student!

I would think that my references (from FF&S2 and High Guard) would give
you the leeway you need.  If you don\'t want to violate T4 tech canon
(that repulsors are TL-16), you can always point out that:

1.  The 3I has been at TL-15 for quite some time (a century or so), and
therefore certain TL-16 developments can appear at any time; and

2.  The Darrian Confederation is _already_ at TL-16, and a space station
of the type you describe could easily employ licensed Darrian tech.

I believe you are being a bit harsh.  Every once in a while, a cinematic
space opera can be entertaining.  OTOH, a steady diet of cinematic space
opera would grow tiresome, just as a steady diet of [insert your
favorite junk food here] would eventually dull your palate.

Well, IIRC, the only \'fields\' in canon are black & white globes, which aren\'t air tight.  Not saying something like a field that holds air in isn\'t capable at highr techs, but just hasn\'t been developed yet at lower techs.  Or, just handwave it and say the field generating equipment is so large, expensive, and tricky to operate safely that most people *prefer* solid matter between them and the elements than a cancankerous field generator.

Sounds like it\'d take place right smack dab in the middle of Reavers\' Deep.  
Check my site, I\'ve got maps & library data & all kindsa stuff on RD.

You might find some stuff there you can use.

Well, in the RW, even though we have cool "advanced" games like Myst,
Unreal, Sim-City/Earth/Ant, etc., we stil have cribbage, chess, checkers,
poker, and so on. We even port them and variations of them into our
computers.

These sound great! They might even sell in the RW!

I would also imagine military types would play some form of craps, perhaps
with non-cubicle dice, due to the small size of the pieces making them easy
to carry. Card games would seem universally appealing, and easy to carry as
well.

   Gack!  Too many for game purposes.  Most would likely be in deep space
or would be companions to main sequence stars.

   No prob--neither do most astronomers...

   As an alternative to a star on the companion table or perhaps as an
alternative to a Jovian planet, yes.

   FYI, small brown dwarfs (around 5 Jupiter masses) have diameters that
aren\'t all that much bigger than Jupiter--in fact as the mass of a brown
dwarf goes up, the diameter the diameter actually becomes *smaller* than
Jupiter.  This is because of gravitation effects that are not counteracted
by fusion as in stars.

Interest in the droyne in general could have started anytime after 0.  The
fact that they were widespread, and not just seperate races that happened
to look a lot alike probably did not occure until after the Pacifications.
Probably only when the relatively close droyne worlds in the Marches made
this apparent.  This could have happend in the late 300s, after several
major worlds in the Marches joined the Imperium .

The site at Antiquity was discovered in 385, full of droyne coyns.  It
probably wasn\'t common knowledge what coynes were at that time, however.
Antiquity was opened to the public around 800.  So the association between
the droyne and Ancients probably became known to the general public around
that time, just after they were given Majore Race status.  This doesn\'t
necessarily mean that everyone knew the Ancients were droyne, only that the
droyne were there, like humans (which essentially they were).

 Lots of publicity at this time.  Lots of investigation into what they do,
bringing out psionic use evidence.  Psionic use was recognized in the
casting ceremonies, so whenever these ceremonies were studied would reveal
psionic use among the general Droyne population, and not just random
individuals.  This happened prior to the Suppressions in the late 800\'s,
and probably after the Major Race designation.  Not much time to confirm
theories...

By the 900\'s investigation into the droyne had stopped cold, so any
possible Ancient sites on droyne worlds would not be known (if they hadn\'t
already been discovered).  Things that had been discovered about the droyne
were suppressed, and forgoten by the general public.

By the 1100s the Ancient/Droyne connection is known only to highly
specialized researchers with access to Ancients sites.  The continuing
threat of the Zhodani means that none of these researchers would be in the
Marches, where they could be corrupted by the zhos or the droyne telepaths.

The average public knowledge of Ancients is that they were likely humans
(especially if you are Solomani or Geonee) and that they kept other races
as servants, such as droyne and vargr.  Maybe some laymen who have done
lots of reading on the subject might know of theory that the droyne are the
Ancients.
After Twilights Peak there is no evidence, so the theory that the Droyne
are the Ancients is still just a theory.

These are just random thoughts based on canon events.  To my knowledge
nothing much is said exactly about who knows what.

No.

For ships of the escort/destroyer size range you\'re talking about, it is
impractical to put them in a pressurized bay--it\'s much simpler to leave
the bay open and use umbilical access tubes to connect to the ship (for
loading and departure) and service the exterior via vacc suits, remote
robots or waldo-equipped service vehicles.

Actually, unless there\'s some very good reason for the ship to be
enclosed, why bother having "interior" docks at all? Just make an
open-frame station and have ships dock against the exterior of the
station.

Clear bay 327. We are opening the magnetic field.

Nope, nothing like that in Traveller. No "force fields" as such...

The 1000-ton Scout tender has an openable bay, which completely contains
smaller ships, but that\'s only intended to hold a couple 100-ton
scout/courier or xboat class ships. I\'m not sure if the bay can be
pressurized at all--again, what purpose would pressure and gravity in the
bay serve that would justify the expense of an enclosed bay, an airtight
door, and the volume of oxygen/life support/artificial gravity such a bay
would require?

Well, considering that the game of chess has survived for centuries, a
mutated form thereof might still exist. An adventure from an old issue of
JTAS, "Aces & Eights" (I think it was a John M. Ford adventure, actually)
included specific references to playing cards with the same suits we use
now, though as I recall specific card games weren\'t mentioned.

There is plenty of room for creation of Traveller games, many based on the
same sort of concepts as ancient or contemporary games: most TTL 5-7
worlds would have tabletop games based on pasteboard maps with wooden or
plastic or metal gamepieces like many of us are old enough to have grown
up with... 
	More advanced computer-based games are probably quite common in
the Traveller universe, especially on shipboard computers: given a week in
jumpspace with little to do, a passenger (or lazy crew member) has a lot
of time on their hands, and most free traders have fairly limited choices
of scenery. Of course, our characters always spend that week brushing up
on new skills, fixing their gear and doing maintenance on interior parts
of the ship (and occasionally doing things like foiling hijack attempts,
solving murder mysteries, and plotting interstellar intrigue with the
passengers of an interstellar luxury liner, etcetera...)

Perhaps they play "Papers and Paychecks," a historical roleplaying game
set in an ancient Solomani culture where the characters play students and
workers in a primitive TL 7/8 setting... 

Okay, it\'s an old joke. So sue me.

One shudders to think what kind of games Vargr corsairs play while whiling
away the hours between pirate raids. I imagine "Toss The Pinkie Prisoner
Out The Airlock" is high on their list of preferred entertainments, not to
mention the ever-popular "Beat Up The Littlest Vargr On The Ship."

Keven\'s site has starmaps, UPP data and more for Reaver\'s Deep. It\'s a
great resource.

Not sure of the URL though - it\'s bookmarked somewhere...

Nope - expect a lot of material from BITS end August/start September to
coincide with GenCon UK. I know ACQ and 1 other are in final stages, and
another 2 or 3 arein development. More on this as it firms up. 101st
Spaceborne is presently on the backburner as real life commitments have

Derek Stanley has some good stuff on Daibei, which is right next door to

You asked if I had been fired upon?  What that has to do with a fantasy
(sorry, sci-fi) game I don\'t know, I\'m not sure.  Please explain what my
being fired upon in r/l has to do with your fantasy of GT BD?

The other way of taking it (but I really didn\'t want to go there) was , that
it sounded in your question like (in relation to BD), "Have you ever been
shot at?  Well I have and I\'m glad I had 90% protection from it!" which I
can only assume to be a fantasy thing anyway, as I don\'t know of any 90%
protective body armour.  So what does it have to do with it again?

You value yourself high, and yes, you have agreed with several (and I\'m sure
you would for payment), but only when they have agreed with you anyway (I am
yet to see you post about downgrading BD and not fielding IM\'s in combat
situations without BD).  Do you do "anything" for money?

Perhaps you should... your stuff is quite acceptable to that media I
believe.

Yes, because IM\'s are not multi-task units and don\'t fight outside of BD
under any circumstances, hence the disad option.  Semantics, I apologise for
my generalisation.

So now you\'re going against that bit in LBB#4 that clearly states that
all TL14/15 battlefields are battledress and fusion guns.

Surely the Imperial Army is a TL14/15 mob, only the planetary defense
forces are "gauss rifles and wearing CES", or worse (based on the FFW
counters).

Next you\'ll be giving in to arguments in favour of some of the Imperial
Army units having "Brown Bess and redcoats" just because there are low
tech planets in the Imperium.

Sorry, but IMO, if the IA doesn\'t have decent weapons, they aren\'t worth
the cargo space they consume.

In M0 you have different capabilities but GURPS doesn\'t cover that period.

Hopefully Doug^h^h^h^hBruce will feel better if criticised from all sides.

I always thought that at light second ranges or more the acceleration or "normal velocity" doesn\'t matter because the 
direction of a target is predictable.

My approche was to convert old MT Fire Control / TL Difficulties to an logarithmic scale like DSR rules. And the result 
seems to me very good. 

I thought that a human size target was Target Size 0. (Signatue = log10(Volume[m3]+1)/2)

The quality FC TL 5 is 6.5 this is the minimum number to get an impossible difficulty for a human sized target an 
maximum FC range. The quality is increasing every TL by 0.3 . Example TL 10 is sensitivty 8.0 .

Range is just like DSR.

Difficulty = FC Quality + Target Size - Range

Modifiers for lasers and meson weapons at far range -0.5 and possible some others for different environments and 
weapon types.

What Do you think?

The "X" in OS X is the roman number 10, is pronounced "ten", and has
nothing to do with the X Window system. OS 9 is a registered trademark of
Microware Systems Inc. for their computer operating system. Apple cannot
sell an operating system of that name without infringing the trademark and
confusing a heck of a lot of people.

This seems to make sense and match canon.  Something that has come to my
mind is the Ancients as religion, Droyne-worship, or a Humaniti/Vargr
Droyne-worship cult. The coynes, Droyne caste ceremonies, Droyne psionics
all would fit nicely into a cult background. Perhaps as an offshoot of the
Church of the Chosen Ones in which Humanity has been accepted in a lesser or
even equal role.  A great plot hook would be for a group of PC\'s to be hired
to take such a group to an interdicted Droyne world or perhaps the PC\'s
could be members of such a cult. The response of the Droyne would be most
interesting, especially since they would find that the believers really did
believe in their deepest mind.

Oh so many plot devices and so little gaming time.:(

If for some reason it is necessary that work be carried on in an atmosphere
a portable tent or even hard blister affair could be attached to the hull to
allow maintenance personnel to work in a shirt-sleeve environment. (Just as
they now do on ocean vessels, where work below the water-line must be done
outside the water.) Such a tent might be used to prevent small parts from
floating away. Gravity control might even be used to allow the hull to
always be down, or a platform at right angles to the hull might allow a
worker to stand just so the work was at a comfortable working height.

There\'s some obscure references.  Clavius research park on Luna has its
atmosphere held in by a "gravitic dome" that\'s open to space.  The dome
had been running uninterrupted for over two *thousand* years, I think,
since the Long Night.  This was in the article on Luna written by Marc
Miller for Dragon #87, as part of the series they were running on the 
Moon in various SFRPGs.

I also think there\'s a reference in the Darrian alien module of a grav
domed undersea city that survived the Maghiz (protected by the ice cap
and at least tens of meters of seawater).  That one might have had a
network of grav modules in a geodesic frame to hold back the sea; I\'d
have to look.

However, it\'s not clear to me that you\'d want to fly a starship or an
air/raft through one of these domes.  The impression I take away from
this is that gravitics are very reliable, though, and that gravitic
structures aren\'t uncommon.  There\'s that floating building in one of
the Double Adventures (shipped to a backwater, low-tech world!), and
references to entire flying *cities*!  (These presumably avoid storms,
since there\'s also mentions of storms violent enough to ground air/raft
travel -- but if you\'ve also got gravitic domes, you might just be able
to fly over storms.)

*sigh*  When I was shot at, I desperately wished that I had that kind of
protection.  Once again, you are putting things into my mouth.

I\'m easy, not cheap. :)

Since you go off on a tangent, I\'ll assume that you can\'t cover your claim.

I haven\'t posted about downgrading BD?  See my response to the \'"Sane"
battledress\' post, where I praised a suit of BD that had about half the
armor I originally proposed.

Sorry, but I looked at the prices in a comic book store the other day.
Yeesh!  I can rember getting ten comic books for a dollar back when I was a

Congratulations, you are the second person ever to be kill filed by me in
the TML.

If I thought it would make any difference, I would send you the posts in
which I discuss the different uniforms of the IMF, the circumstances where
they would fight un augmented, but you are just being a pain.  It\'s obvious
that you don\'t even read what I write, and only are interested in
continuing a fizzle war that everyone else has moved on from.  Your recent

Given that \'damage\' (in GURPS, and also in Traveller) isn\'t linear in energy, its closer to proportional to the square root of energy, multiplying by velocity is just fine.

        Sorry, Mike, this is the wrong mindset.  Grav-cities are canon.
Which is why the Virus attack killed so many....  Stations inside gas giants
that depend on CG and manuever to avoid plumeting in...  billion-person
establishments on vaccum worlds.... etc, etc...  dozens if not hundred of
examples where "the concept of relying wholly on an electrically generated
field for life" is *routine*...  The culture of a TL10+ society where fusion
is small and cheap means power outages are presumably a non-issue.

That was my main concern when I asked the original question.

I have started to compile a database of library data and am trying to index
different versions of entries for different time periods as well as for
different security clearances and areas. The idea being that I can set the
current game date as well as the area/original database owners (Imperial,
Zhodani, etc.) as presets in the interface.

I started this out to help keep the multi-dimensional nature of this data
straighten my own head, but then thought of using it in a game.

I can present players with an interface that they can query and retrieve
articles based on whatever passwords/security clearances they have access
too.

I\'ve really enjoyed all the information and ideas that have come out of this
thread.

It depends on if the target is involved in evasive movement, and on how fast
it can change its vector of acceleration.  At one light-second, there\'s
basically a two second delay for sensor lag and weapons fire delay.  If you
assume that a ship can instantly change direction of thrust (which is
optimistic, of course) a 1 G ship can be anywhere within 20 meters of the

enough that a Tigress can attempt to dodge.

Personally I\'m not sure that gravitics would be the answer to
atmosphereic control. In the case you site of a park on Luna (sorry no
refence, I\'ve never been a big Dragon reader) I can buy. If you found or
made a deep, crater, lined the floor with grav plates and dropped air in
is would stay there (with some slow loss over time. However, it would
have to be a DEEP crater to give the proper pressure, or you would have
to have the gravity a conciderably more than one gee to compress the
atmospheric "lake".

Using gravitics to repel water however I"m not sure I buy into (I\'ll
pull out my Darriens book and read it over). Evern if you used gravitics
on a local region of water to make it "weightless" I would think that
pressure would force it to fill the "bubble", unless the entire body of
water was also make weighless, thus releiving the pressure problem.

An electrostatic charge (soap bubble) effect might work to contain
atmosphere. In that case though, I\'d think that "breaking" it, by moving
a ship through it would cause a loss of the atmoshere being contained.
Not to mention the effects that the feild itself would have on the
ship\'s electronics. Not sure what power would be needed to contain the
air.

Of course my veiws a filtered through my picture of the Trav universe,
and, therefore, less than perfect.

You must be pretty unhappy already if you live in a modern, industrialized
country!

Most of us already rely on an electrically powered web (and I don\'t mean the
WWW) for life. If all of the electrical power in the world went off
tomorrow, and stayed off, how many people would die? Hundreds of millions? A
billion? Maybe more?

Few people give a second thought to how precariously our own society is
balanced. Traveller isn\'t our own society of course If you\'ve got really,
really cheap fusion power, then power consumption and output would very
nearly become a non-issue.

Sure, you might have people with phobias, just like there are still people
who are afraid of flying, but ultimately most people will never even notice
unless something happens. Of course, at that point it\'s too late.

Heh.  Deep indeed -- a 100 kilometer deep lake would still lose air at a considerable rate, unless it was also very cold.  Of course, a million Gs over a spread of about a meter would probably do decent job of holding in atmosphere, but that doesn\'t seem to be available with traveller technology.

Isn\'t the Imperial palace a gravitically suspended sphere floating over the
surface of Capital/Core? I seem to remember this description from some TNS
entries.

Or maybe I am getting it confused with the floating palace in the Eye of
the World series of books (eek!)

I think the difference is how fast people died off.

In our society, a complete failure of all power generation equipment
would really only kill those on life support - at least immediately.
Compare that to an entire city of millions, where everyone dies in
a matter of minutes if the grav support fails. It would take days
(or even months) for our society to suffer those kinds of casualties
from power loss, giving us some time to try and fix things.

Granted, our current high-tech societies use technology to keep
us alive in the long term. You can\'t support thousands of people
per square mile with hunter-gatherer technology.

It would be absolutely invaluable in a game, it could change the face of
gaming forever! ;) I am wondering if the same model could be adapted to
other meliux? The Storyteller stuff could really use this kinda thing. So
could a lot of other games I imagine.

Again: COOLIO! The more the interface helps to suspend your disbelief, the
better. Berhaps a Ships Nav-Comp. overlaid to handle where they get the data
from? Of course date must come first... A module the players can edit for
their Ship\'s Computer?

Tlaukhu Naval Bases support the operations of interstellar naval units

Ooooh, this brings up an important question (important to me, at least).
I\'m spending this weekend in Mount Crested Butte, Colorado. Is there
a FLGS in town?

Given that it\'s forecasted to rain, I\'d hate to be stuck in my hotel
room reading a non-Traveller book. Pity I can\'t bring my campaign
laptop but I promised my wife I wouldn\'t bring any Traveller material
since we\'re celebrating our wedding anniversary on this trip.

I mean I never said I wouldn\'t _look_ for it. If I just _happen_ to
run across it, it\'s not my fault, is it? Is it?

The point I was trying to make was that if there was a field generator
that could trap air in the way Jesse was asking about, then it would be
in more common use than mechanical domes. Since physical domes are
susceptible to physical effects (i.e.. earthquakes, etc.) if a field
effect was available, it WOULD be in COMMON use, JUST LIKE gravitic
buildings, cities, etc. are. Therefore, by inference, such a feild DOES
NOT EXIST.

I started a thread a little while ago on Xenobiology.
For what it\'s worth, here\'s my Cr 0.02 :-
To recap, it would appear that life requires energy, building blocks and
a solvent for reactions to happen in.
	The problem is that liquids turn into gas (\'boil\') when the vapour
pressure of the liquid is equal to ambient pressure. 
	Unless the world is very cold or enjoys continual refilling from some
source (e.g. surface ice), the solvent system isn\'t going to last very
long, since the ambient pressure is effectively zero.
	Since we require a relatively low ambient temperature, the energy
contribution from the planet\'s star is going to be quite small as the
planet must be an outer one. A vaccuum flower must have a very low
metabolic rate if it is primarily \'fuelled\' by its local star.
	Let\'s try another tack.
	The \'vaccuum flower\' exploits the temperature differential between the
surface and some distance \'underground\' (geothermal activity or tidal
heating from a nearby gas giant) to generate the energy it needs to
perform metabolic tasks. The \'flower\' is a form of ruggedised \'root\'
system!
	A thriving ecosphere may exist in the ice a few feet below the surface,
supported by the plant (a \'primary producer\').
	A variety of low-temperature solvents may fit the bill (but may
unfortunately not be much use for creating superconductors) - e.g.
ammonia, sulphur dioxide, phosphorus trifluoride - the last remains
liquid down to -160 degrees C.

> 2. What are the problems involved in a plant producing superconductive
> organics? 
AFAIK, all high temperature superconductors so far are ceramics, complex
rare earth and transition metal oxides - and no-one has yet been able to
postulate a satisfactory theory of how they work.
	These (or similar) compounds may have been deposited in the root system
of our plant as structural material (analogous to the calcium salts
deposited in bone, or the silica skeletons of diatoms) in combination
with some \'biological\' material (bone = calcium salts + collagen).
	The superconductivity effect may have been a serendipitous one. Small
\'stripes\' of superconductor may have been laid down by the cells of the
plant to increase rootlet structural strength - then voila! 
	Abundant energy....

In DGP material and MT, room temperature superconduction was an Early or
Average Stellar TL development (\'metaconductors\'). They are everywhere
at typical Imperial tech levels.

Our vaccuum flower would definitely be a biological curiousity, and
possibly useful for supplying cheap power for outer zone bases or
beacons, etc. (although fusion power is so very cheap).

Servicing the ship. Unloading some cargos. Some jobs are only about a

The main prob I have with the GEnie format files is, I have no bloody clue 
*what* bases are in there.  They\'re not in their normal place.  The whole 
sector is baseless, as far as I can tell...

TT doesn\'t do much with the base code except show it in the subsector maps as 
their letter designation.  A code \'M\' would display as M, for instance.

But you might wanna check out Traveller Tools.  It runs under DOS pretty 
good.  I was using it to generate subsector maps with Paint to save \'em off, 
then massaging them with some Linux tools, but I took Win9x totally off my 
computer a few months back.  I\'m currently using Mark Nordstrand\'s Linux 
Traveller suite, but it\'s still in early beta.

Every known human society - and many animal ones (chimps, gorillas,
baboons, all the ceteceans, for example) - have played games of some
sort. Games would certainly exist in the 3I - no question about it.

Human games have several common features, so it is quite possible to
predict the types of game that would be there, just by knowing a bit
about the society. In this case, we have to rely on the canon since
everyone has their own idea about just how the Imperium works (hence
all the IMTU messages in this group). So - the major features of the
society.

1. Commercially based, mainly around megacorporations with
interstellar trade.
2. Politics are aristocratic, although the aristocrats are drawn from
the rich traders of the past (or present).
3. Military power is paramount - it is what enabled the imperium to
come to power. Hence the draft.
4. Crime is rife, and difficult to stop. The criminals can run across
light years.
5. Technology is rigidly controlled (by today\'s standards) and varies
widely.
6. Wealth can be extreme, and so can poverty.

GIven those six (my top six definitions of the Imperium - in order),
there are several types of game that are almost inevitable.

1. Counting strategy games, such as the African bush games played with
stones. Simple and cheap.
2. Territorial strategy games, with high tactical elements. Something
like the Japanese game of Go.
3. Gambling games played with cards, dice or other semi-random tools
such as coins.
4. Power games, with \'graded\' levels of success. Backgammon, bridge
and whist as well as something like \'Moot\'.
5. Wargames - probably abstracted, such as chess. Can\'t risk getting
too near to the real thing.
6. Stealing games, where you try to capture power items from
opponents. We don\'t have many of these.
7. Travel games, where you have to cross a certain area in particular
ways. Similar to Chinese Checkers, perhaps.
8. Games where the values of pices can be improved or degraded.
Perhaps like Chinese chess.
9. Monopoly-style games of finance and power.
10. Almost certainly, real gambling of power and influence using
constituency groups (like in Diplomacy).

Will there be games in the Imperium? For many, they could be expected
to be a way of life, IMHO.

Well, we can be sure that there are all sorts of games in the Far
Future, high-tech and low-tech, games of chance, games of skill, games
of outguessing or outpsyching your opponents, drinking games, sex games,
you name it.  But on Rigel 7, they play a man\'s game.  It\'s called

Remember last year\'s ice storm in Quebec? That killed power for a long time
for a lot of people. Some deaths, but not that many. Very few critical
system have no backups.

Which is why, when designing vehicles for T4 (102 Vehicles, another FREE

Except that TL15 vacc suits are pretty unobtrusive. Scouts wear their\'s all
the time, with the membrane helmet rolled up in the collar, just in case
pressure drops. (Ref: WBH).

For what it\'s worth, Jeff Zeitlin and I have been working on 101
Recreations on and off for a while. (Mostly off since January, I\'ll admit.)
That\'s one of the projects I\'d planned on getting to draft stage by August.
So far we have about 50 pages of material. Sounds like you should become a
contributor.

As I see it, there will _always_ be a niche for \'traditional\'
board games, although in higher-tech areas, they may be computer
programs that can play, act as a monitor for human players, or
both.

I suspect that in general, you will find the following games:

(1) a \'strategotactical\' game such as chess, checkers, or go
(2) a \'chase\' game such as backgammon, goose, or
    snakes-and-ladders
(3) \'dice\' games (where the dice may not necessarily show numbers
    or be regular polyhedra - or even all identical)
(4) \'card\' games (where the cards may not be sequenced, or may
    not be grouped [suits])

>I can see a game called \'Moot\' where the players fight to win votes and

>expanding or a trading game called \'Megacorps\' or \'Brokers\'. 

All of these may very well be possibilities, but only for a
society that gets to the \'Monopoly\' stage of game creation - in a
sense, these are early \'simulation\' games. One issue with
\'simulations\' of this type is that their popularity is based on
the perception of the subject of the simulation, _and_ on the
\'connection\' of that subject to the players own lives/interests.
So, \'Monopoly\', \'Megacorps\', and \'Brokers\' would not likely be
popular in a true communist society, nor \'Moot\' in an anarchy,
nor \'Expansion\' in a pacifist society.  Think about it...

\'Ordinary\' gambling games fill this niche nicely, unless the
professional culture is one with a high level of machismo, and a
low requirement for dexterity.

Do yourself a BIG favor and take this trip to become just as fanatical
about your wife.  don\'t even think about traveller.  Spend all your time
with her being romantic.  We\'ll all still be here when you get back, and
your wife will love you all the more for it.  Remember how sensitive
women can be if they feel they are \'competing\' for your attention.

I did the Ancients as religion thing a long time ago.  IMTU, it\'s kind of
a spacer joke, an excuse for traders, scouts and other space-bum riff-raff
to get together and throw wild parties.  The cult is centred in the
Spinward Marches, particularly at Regina and other major worlds with A
class ports.  It tends to be associated with drunken riots, where the
traders and scouts end up brawling with all the Navy (& Marine) personnel
they can find.  One particularly notorious year ended up with the Army,
Marines and Police firing tear-gas at each other.

What do the Droyne think about this?  Who knows?

As a kicker, throw in a bit of linguistic confusion, similar to the
pony/poni issue (or the Jynnan Tonnix from _Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the

  So sorry, isn\'t it _obvious_ that "more advanced" applies to the social system
itself? Quite frankly, whatever SolSec is working towards doesn\'t impress
us, and
we\'d be concerned if we thought that you could keep it all together long enough 
accomplish any of your mad dreams. The possibility of a great empire run by
madmen 
is distressing, however unlikely.

  I suggest you consider AM4 - you\'re dealing with a master race that not only

  Besides, we have drones for the messy work...

Quebec is still in an environment that is favorable to humans, for the most part.  If we were living someplace with a flourine atmosphere, for instance, and totally dependent on electricity, and it failed, we\'d be toast.

I\'m not sure that there is much of a difference though. Every few years
there\'s a nasty and tragic plane crash / accident. Lots of people die.
People still fly every day. In America, thousands of lives are lost each
year in automobile accidents. People still fly. There are many other
examples with different technologies.

Despite that, they became commonplace. Few people even give them a second
thought. It\'s that mentality that I was trying to illustrate in the case of
the electrical web that we rely on.

Once something becomes accepted and commonplace and *trusted* people don\'t
even think about it anymore, which is what I was trying to point out.

(Rob chants the anaesthetist\'s mantra : "No, no, no, no, no...")
Firstly, it would take a minimum of a few minutes for people on
ventilators or circulatory assist devices to die - much longer if the
staff were doing their job. Immediate death is rare in hospital.
Most critical facilities, be they hospitals or whatever have backup
power generation on site.
	A \'complete failure of all power generation equipment\' scenario is
*very* unlikely i.e. Virus/Y2K Armageddon (gahh) or \'rules of physics
change so as to prevent electrical power generation\' (magic (or alien
super-science, a la Patrick Tilley\'s \'Fade-Out\'), which is a moot point
anyway considering our nervous systems would fail too, since they\'re
running on microvolt potential differences....). 
	In the case of an Intensive Care unit or an operating theatre, the
staff would hand ventilate patients (been there, done that) ; and most
circulatory assist devices have backup battery power.
	Those people that are likely to die _promptly_ at TL 8 are motorists
that collide when traffic lights fail or pilots and passengers of
aircraft that get caught when the ILS, etc. go off during a critical
phase of landing.

With regard to \'force fields\' :-
Anthony Jackson is right - to contain an atmosphere\'s pressure worth of
gas on the lunar surface would require gravitational lensing in the
millions of g\'s (and a generous gas supply to replenish what gets lost
at the field\'s edge). This is not possible at Imperial TLs with
equipment with the capabilities given in the rules. However, see below.

The underwater dome is even more problematic. In this instance an
attempt is being made to keep multiple atmosphere\'s worth of water *out*
(or maintain a bubble of gas at one atmosphere in face of these extreme
external conditions).
	Lowering the gravity in a small volume to cause the air bubble to \'boil
up\' to an appropriate pressure could work (assuming multi-million g
contragrav capability) ; but bubble pressure would then be equal to
ambient (multiple ATA) - not compatible with human survival.

Using gravitics to increase the structural strength of a dome built of
*something* I could swallow (grav plates are distributed across the
surface of the dome, computer controlled as load conditions change with
the circulation of the air mass within).
	The dome itself doesn\'t have to be air or water tight, just as long as
leakages are well managed. So the Clavius research park could be open to
space by varying amounts depending on the contragrav applied.
Turn down the power, let the gaps between the segments of the dome open
up, and bleed off some gas!

Please support the crusade to limit the proliferation of \'handwavium

Maybe you can even get the chimp to teach the religious types theology.

They\'re mentioned a bit in \'Twilight\'s Peak\' I think.  Droyne jump drives are 
hand-built custom jobs, but highly tuned.  They look a bit strange, too.

And stayed off.  That is the point - power outages are seldom permanent,
almost never total. (Just don\'t think about Auckland\'s CBD a while back -
that was mismanagement - but not total).   Society would have to adapt
pretty darned quick I\'d guess, but the chances of a total permanent
worldwide blackout are extremely close to 0.

Sure, a few casualties would occur rapidly from electrically held equipment,
traffic lights, hospitals, etc... but all in all we don\'t rely on, (as
opposed to \'use extensively\') electricity.  I\'d be understating it to call
it a mere nuisance, but our electrical use is tinged with safety already -
critical systems have failsafes.  A total power loss in an aircraft, for
instance, is offset by alternate crititical systems - the APU fails, big
deal.  In a car, unless you\'re in the middle of a manoeuvre, the worst
that\'ll happen is you\'ll lose your push and coast to a stop.  Keep the
clutch out and you\'ll even retain power steering up until the last few
mph\'s.  Centrifucal brakes in elevators.  Computers would go off though, as
would the TML :(

True.  Multiple-sourced power wouldn\'t be a problem either, other than at
the single point of contact like at a single field generator.  But
redundancy would be still be the norm in situations of life or death. Of
course, I\'ve countered my own argument here...  Lots and lots of small(ish)
field generators.

Statistics and public relations jobs are the key here.  It *is* safer in a
plane than it is in a car, isn\'t it?

The point wasn\'t how probable it was, but that people already rely on an
infrastructure powered by electricity and most people don\'t even give it a
second thought. My post was about the mindset of people rather than the
possibility of such a thing happening on Terra.

Actually, at least here in America, it is a reliance on electricity, not
simply extensive use. With the loss of electricity the telephone system goes
out. With no telephone system food distribution becomes problematic at best,
placing emergency resources becomes difficult, if not simply impossible.

Business would grind to a halt. Economies would collapse, etc...

All that\'s secondary anyway, since the point referred to the tendency of
people to not perceive mundane hazards as hazards unless their attention is
called to them. In skyscrapers across the world, millions of people go to
work in skyscrapers, even though a serious fire could kill them all. While
it\'s not a high probability, they never even think about the danger (unless,
of course, they just saw "Towering Inferno"). All it takes is a serious fire
and a faulty sprinkler system. It did happen here in Philadelphia just a few
years ago, fortunately it happened on an off day. The fatalities were either
low or non-existant, the building was completely gutted though.

Los Angeles is another case in point. Millions of people live there knowing
full well that the "big one" might come along and they might day. Business
goes on as usual. On the east coast, people continue to build homes and live
in Hurricane Alley. In the midwest, the threat of tornadoes is always
present.

In AM5 - Droyne. However it doesn\'t say that they are highly sort after, just
that "Their hand made jump drives are the best in known space" (or some

    It depends on the society in question: how much free time do the people
have, how easy is it for them to get together, how gregarious are they, etc.

    Personally, I don\'t think board games will be a major factor in the
future of Terra. That doesn\'t mean that they won\'t exist in the Third
Imperium. The board game market has already begun to crumble in the United
States, which is my only point of "gaming reference."

    The vast majority of board games are about face to face interaction. On
Earth the golden age of the board game focused on family entertainment with
a strong emphasis on themes that were also attractive to children.

    In the U.S. for example, the amount of time that parents spend working
has gone up, leaving them with less time to spend with their children than
30 or 40 years ago... the golden age of board games.  As there was less time
for family entertainment, more and more boardgames solely aimed at children
started to pop up. By the early 80s the old standards, stuff like Life,
Stratego, etc. waned in popularity while games based on popular children\'s
toys were the norm.

    As the 80s wore on, adult party games became more and more popular.
Witness the rise of games like Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary. That was a
flash in the pan though.

    War board games took the board game off in a different tangent, but the
sheer complexity of the games limited their appeal, and more importantly
their market. The set up and playing times were mind-boggling.

    Regardless, the vast majority of board games are about face to face
social interaction. The one thing that might well keep board games alive in
the Imperium is the fact that there is a structure very similar to that of
the nuclear family: a small ship\'s crew. In this environment, board games
might well be popular.

    One of the interesting things about board games is that, to some extent,
they put an entire family on equal footing. Monopoly or Life are not really
strategy games, although strategy can be applied to them. In this sense,
ship\'s crews might be apt to keep a number of board games on their ship to
"blow off steam" when the stress of being kept in close quarters for such a
long time leads to tension.

    This doesn\'t work with the majority of war board games though. It
doesn\'t tend to work with most video games either. The game has to have the
right "mix" of skill / strategy and luck. Most video games lean towards
skill / strategy, as do most war board games.

    I\'ve seen some other responses that seem to say that games will still
exist. There is no doubt that games will still exist. I fear that board
games (with a few exceptions) will become memories.

    They\'re fast on their way in the United States. Of course, it depends on
how technology is spread throughout your game world. Self-contained pocket
videogame systems can be exported to worlds with low-technology. They can be
made cheaply as well. They can even be made to take up considerably less
cargo volume on a jump capable trader than your average board game. Advances
in computer technology will make better and cheaper handheld game systems
that work for a long time on very little power.

    Such games can be made to link in a variety of different ways, even
allowing face to face interaction between players.

    Computer games that look or play like what we know as board games are
another thing entirely. They\'ll be around forever.

    Certain board games survive through a sort of "traditional inertia."
Chess is one example. Chess has attained a sort of legitimacy that other
games never have. It\'s the only board game that I can think of that people
can win college scholarships for. It has a role in western society that is
utterly unique and, to some extent, self-sustaining. It also helps that
extremely good chess players tend to be extremely good in mathematical and
scientific pursuits as well.

    It\'s also helpful to examine how different types of games fulfill
different social needs. However, at this point the discussion would move
away from board games and move into video games, card games, and games like
dominoes and mah jong.

If we were living someplace with more than a trace of fluorine in the

that you\'d need enormous geological or electrical disturbances to
\'de-salt\' it or otherwise unlock it from rocks. Whatever\'s on this world

Hydrofluoric acid toxicity is dependent more on HF\'s affinity for
calcium and other important ions, plus the effects of the leftover
fluoride, than the acid load itself.
(Your body eliminates the equivalent of 2 litres of concentrated
hydrochloric acid in the form of carbon dioxide a day).

HF binds calcium, leading to problems with neuromuscular function ;
fluoride anion (F-) is a direct poison to the kidneys and liver in
concentrations in excess of 55 micromoles per litre (~1.1 milligrams/L).

I\'m not sure that there is much of a difference though. Every few years

I\'m not sure this is possible.  I have worked closely with HF acid and
its most deadly feature is that when it gets on you, it DOESN\'T burn. 
It just quietly soaks in like water.  Some hours later, when it begins
de-calsifying your body, it begins to hurt.  Depending on the
concentration of the HF exposure, death may occur.  Your best defense is
a cold shower right after the exposure and some calcium glutamate shots
at the hospital.

I myself was exposed to a minute portion of it once, but thank God, it
was mixed with Acetic and Nitric, so it BURNED right away, alerting me
in time to get good treatment and suffer no ill effects.

As to inhalation of HF vapor, even the most briefest exposure can cause
some scarring of the minor pathways in the lungs.  It is too nasty to be
stored in the traditional glass bottles, so you\'ll find it stored in
special teflon-plastic containers.

When mixed with Nitric acid in high quantities, it becomes extremely
active and corrosive.  It also builds up a lot of thermal reaction. 
When mixed with Chromium Trioxide, Potassium Dichromate or a Chromium
Trioxide-Cupric Nitrate mixture, it becomes very unstable.  Introduce a
foreign substance into your HF+Chromium Trioxide/Cupric Nitrate
solution, and you will get a reaction quite similiar to an erupting
volcano.  The mixture will generate intense heat and will boil into an
eruption that lasts about 3-5 minutes before the reaction dies down.

On the bright side, I can\'t think of ANYTHING that will clean than HF
all by itself.

Firstly, it would take a minimum of a few minutes for people on
ventilators or circulatory assist devices to die - much longer if the
staff were doing their job. Immediate death is rare in hospital.
Most critical facilities, be they hospitals or whatever have backup
power generation on site.

The original poster was putting forth a scenario where power is gone,
and not coming back. There is only so long a hospital\'s backup power
supply can operate, and then only so long someone can hand-ventilate
a patient. 

"Immediate" was too strong a word, but I was using it in comparison to
how long it would take for most victims of this catastrophe (Chris Seaman\'s
millions or billions) to die - mostly from the failure of sections of the
food generation and distribution network.

There is a "canon" reference in an old copy of "The Dragon" of all places
talking about Luna... One of the surface cities on Luna has an "open" dome in
which the air is held in via focused "grav beams" or somesuch. Think
repulsor/tractor beams that are pulling on the air instead of something like a
missle.

Whether it would work somewhere where you had to have access to the entire
volume, I dunno. I think there was mention of slow leakage in the dome as
well, requiring the air to constantly be "topped up".

Yup, this is the sort of thing I was thinking of.  Another possibility is
to lay a length of plant across the ground and use temperature
differentials across shadow/sun sections to generate electrical energy (I
think this could be done even if the temp differentials are quite low, any
gearheads wanna clear this up for me?).

Hmm, I don\'t think the fact that the solvents are not elements of
superconductors is a problem.  The flowers may have started bringing in
the building blocks simply because they were suspended in whatever the
solvents are.

That fits my understanding.  A few websites I saw had superconductors
molecules on them composed of a few basic organics and some slightly rarer
stuff like Selenium, Gallium or Ytrrium tacked on.  These are not terribly
rare (Selenium can be found in brazil nuts), so I think it\'s plausible
that the building blocks would be there.

Yup, we\'re definately on the same page, here.  This of course has the nice
side-effect that the plant structures act as superconducting "wires".  I
was picturing them as ground-hugging tri-leaved flowers connected by
rhizomes (for using the heat differential across wide ranges) and with
deep-diving roots for geo-thermal energy.  The flowers petals are there to
regulate heat levels (if they\'re in the sun they gather warmth by
spreading and close to avoid excess heat, if in shadow they spread to
radiate heat and close to retain it).

Thanks for the info.

I was thinking that they\'d be useful for mid-tech worlds in the Outrim
Void or other areas where it might be hard to find large-scale
manufacturers of super-conductors.  The plant could provide such materials
with less infrastructure development, basically.  These could be used in
making computers or whatever they are used for in the 3I.

An interesting thing to consider is how these plants might have evolved. 
It seems unlikely for life to evolve on vaccuum worlds (otherwise the
universe would be teeming with these things), so I picture them developing
on worlds that slowly lose their atmosphere and/or which slowly become
tidally locked.  Vaccuum flowers (and their accompanying ecology) would be
the end-stage of a previous "more normal" biosphere. 

Thanks for the very helpful feedback,
Charles C.

I don\'t have the WBH, but your point is taken - in MT, there is no DEX
penalty for wearing a TL-14 Vacc suit. Even so, working in an atmosphere
and with standard gravity is going to be easier than working `outside.\'

Most ship servicing can be done from inside the ship--remember, jump craft
are designed to operate in conditions where it\'s physically impossible to
be outside the craft for a week. And you can service the ship in a vacc
suit: TL8 vacc suits are kinda clumsy, but by the time you hit TL13 or so
they\'re no more uncomfortable than coveralls with a helmet. And if you
want to unload cargo, an umbilical access tube is much simpler and cheaper
than pressurizing a bay for a 5000-ton craft. If you *must* service the
hull in shirtsleeves, then a larger version of the "portable airlock", a
pressurized blister that attaches to the hull, mentioned earlier in this
thread makes no sense.

But your "magnetic field" that passes ships but not air doesn\'t exist, at
least not within Traveller tech levels. So you\'re stuck with pressurizing
and depressurizing that 10,000 dt landing bay every time you want to park
something in it--or just install some umbilical tubes and a big airlock!

Yes...as the manual for Strata StudioPro says: "A bump map is worth a
million polygons."

3D stuff is addicting though...you\'ll find yourself working on stuff
when you should really be doing real work (he says as he types into a

Sadly, the fact of a great Empire (albeit Vilani so it probably rates as
\'quite good\' not \'great\') being ruled by madmen is a fact with the
deplorable and oppressive regime of the Third Imperium.

We at Solsec, sorry, the Solomani Party have long been impressed by the way

and love it!

Methinks that you are trying to provoke us to coming at you through the

How about Leave My Monkey Alone?  It\'s Warren Zevon\'s song about the Mau
Mau uprising, but it could serve as inspiration in a number of Traveller
contexts.  ("In our old colonial home / we drank our bitters while the

Check the Supplement 8?: Library Data entry for Droyne, as well as
Contact! Droyne in JTAS.  I have seen the references, too, but don\'t

Starship Operator\'s Manual notes that there are normally gold coyns

All is in readiness Ghorge. The Solomani beleive that the Device we are

That robot we constructed for the the Imperials will defect at the
proper moment.

The Psi bomb we launced to the core is almost in place, which should do
for the ragheads and the doggies.

Now we just need to get the itching power into the cat\'s boxes.

intersections, because different traffic directions are at different

Typically, within a city on a world high-tech enough to have both grav
vehicles and mass traffic, grav traffic is slaved to computer control. The
vehicle\'s computer links up with city traffic control and the computer
does the rest.  Which gives us some interesting disaster scenarios if the
computer gives out at a bad moment, but hey, this is roleplaying--without
disasters, catastrophes, and poorly-timed malfunctions, it\'d be boring!

This depends a lot on what planet you are on. High-population worlds,
densely populated with a lot of traffic, will probably have regular routes
established, with some form of automated air-traffic control. On a
frontier world with a population of 500, you can pretty much swing your
air/raft however you like it, since there just isn\'t that much else flying
around for you to hit.

Law level is also a factor: low-law worlds are less likely to object
strenuously to someone flying outside the lines, while a high-law world
might routinely take down errant pilots with AA laser batteries for flying
Where They Should Not Be.

Quantum Computer Performs Simulation For First Time

Until now, quantum computers have done simple arithmetic and
searched small databases. But one of the first applications
envisioned for them, proposed in 1982 by Richard Feynman,
was that they could simulate quantum-mechanical processes
better and more efficiently than classical computers.

Demonstrating Feynman\'s idea for the first time, David Cory
at MIT and other researchers have now used a quantum computer
to solve a senior-year undergraduate physics problem,
according to the American Institute of Physics Physics News
Update Number 438. 

They simulated a "truncated harmonic oscillator," the series
of energy levels -- assumed to be finite for simplicity --
experienced by a quantum particle such as an electron which
is bound to another object such as a proton. 

To simulate this system, they used an NMR quantum computer,
a device in which an external magnetic field aligns a group
of atomic nuclei in a liquid, solid, or gas, so that the tiny
magnet associated with each atom\'s nucleus is either along the
field (a state known as "spin-down," which can represent a 0
in binary code) or opposed to it ("spin-up," which can represent
a 1). 

In common with previous designs, the NMR computer consisted of
molecules in the liquid state; in this case, the researchers
manipulated the spins of two atomic nuclei within each molecule.
The manipulation results in the possible energy states for this
two-spin system exactly simulating the possible energy states
for the quantum particle.

Future steps could include modeling the somewhat more
sophisticated real-world system of an electron in a hydrogen
atom. Details will appear in Somaroo et al., Physical Review
Letters, 28 June 1999.

True. But when electricity was literally a matter of life and death, there
_were_ backups. That, at least, was the point I was trying to make. If my
very life depended on electricity, I\'d have my own power system as a backup
to Richmond Hill Hydro.

Meanwhile, the following URL will take you to a comprehensive listing of

I suspect that some equivalents to these will still be around in the 3I

The problem with these sorts of scenarios, at least inasmuch as their
application to Traveller is that high TL power generation is, by our
standards, flabberghastingly decentralized. With cheap, small fusion
plants, you basically generate power where you need it. 

There _is_ no power grid, per se.

Each building will have it\'s own fusion plant, perhaps several, plus
backups.

Power distribution as we do it today is killingly inefficient, the
reason we have 25 kv lines stringing out all over the place is because
we NEED to pump that much power through \'em to be able to get a fraction
of that on the other end.

We put up with it, because as inefficient as our power grid is, it\'s
still many orders of magnitude cheaper than generating it in situ. 

Most power plants, like coal and nuclear plant have to be built huge to
work economically. Others, like hydroelectric are built huge because
they\'re restricted in where they can work, so the most power that\'s
possible is gotten out of them.

We\'re starting to head towards a Traveller mode...several power
utilities are experimenting with fuel cells. The idea is instead of
having a huge coal plant hundreds of miles away, you have a fuel cell
plant operating in your neighborhood. 

These things are no larger than the transformer substations serving the
same area now, and are considerably safer. 

(When I was a 6th grader, I knew a couple kids who snuck into one of
those, despite all the warnings, and got a graphic demonstration of what
high voltage and current does to you. One kid died several weeks later,
and the other lived, but minus an arm, part of a leg, and with horrid
burns.)

With local generation you don\'t need to generate such high currents, and
you lose a lot less in transmission. As a bonus, since the fuel is
natural gas or hydrogen, you can ship that with zero loss of energy,
other than the energy to transport it.

Once you get cheap little fusion plants, heck, each _ward_ in a hospital
can have it\'s own autonomous power source. If one goes down, you just
run long extension cords...

"Temporary Duty

"The 4518th Lift Infantry Regiment is supported through taxes and levies

troop strength are more complex.

"Imperial policy allows Imperial marines to transfer to the 4518th (or
other local units) for a limited period of time. While serving with a local
unit (on /temporary duty/), the soldier is paid by the local unit and
subject to local unit discipline. A promotion of one grade (enlisted rank
only) can be retained at the end of temporary duty when the soldier returns
to an Imperial unit; additional promotions are sometimes recognized, but a
specific application must be made.

"The local unit gains because it receives a trained soldier; one who can
teach current doctrine or techniques. Such individuals help strengthen a
local unit that often depends on a small population for its recruits.

"The Imperium gains from the arrangement, too. The Imperial military
payrolls are relieved of the soldier for the temporary duty period. The
general quality of the non-Imperial forces is increased. The soldier gains
valuable experince in the type of unit he or she is ultimately called upon
to support. There is even a chance the soldier will gain combat experience;
non-Imperial units often get involved in combat."

It was a list of all the people in their service area who had life support

Point I was trying to make was, if you\'re using some kind of nonmaterial

environment, and the power failed, yer dead.  Period.

The Imperial Palace (TD #9) and the undersea city of Zlodh (Darrians)
are from the late CT / early MT era.  Palace tech level is 13.  Zlodh
tech level may be as high as 16, but could be significantly less.

The Palace is a 1 km ball held hovering 500 m over Capital.  It\'s
actually held up by ground-based repulsors -- the Palace itself only
has a backup grav system powerful enough to gently set it down in
case of repulsor failure.  (This is CT/MT, repulsor bays were fairly
low-tech.)  

Now, if the palace were a solid ball of ice, it would mass about 500
million metric tonnes, and weigh five billion Newtons on Earth.  The
underside cross-section is a million square meters, so to hold it up
the repulsors have to exert a pressure on the underside of about 5 MPa
(which is about 50 atm).

Zlodh lies on the floor of Darrian\'s Polar Sea, about 2000 m under
the northern ice-cap.  On Earth, pressure at this depth would be about
200 atm (or 20 MPa).  The description on pp. 38-39 of _Darrians_ imply
the use of repulsors: "A network of grav generators mounted in a
latticework of metal struts keeps the seawater at bay. [...] The grav
generators constantly repel the waters above the lattice, creating
strong currents around all of the city."

However -- neither of these sites are on Earth; the diameter of Capital
is about 8000 km, and Darrian is about 6400 km.  Assuming that they are
as dense as Earth, Darrian\'s surface gravity is 0.50 G and Capital\'s is
0.64 G.  Therefore the correct pressures are probably closer to

  Imperial Palace (Capital):     32 atm
  City of Zlodh (Darrian):      100 atm

This is a difference of just over a factor of three in the repulsion
pressure, assuming the repulsion force is evenly spread out.

My analogy would be a modern nuclear submarine - the day-to-day running
you can do from within the ship, and you can do a good deal of the
dockside work with the boat in the water; but the dockside jobs are a
lot easier in dry dock.

Well, that depends if there *is* a simple tech to keep an atmosphere in,
as the original poster asked. Personally, I don\'t think that there is
(at TL15/16, anyways) - but I can see why you\'d want one.

Ahem, not `my\' magnetic field. As I said above, I personally don\'t think
it\'s possible at the current TLs.

I\'m a helicopter pilot, which is about as close as you\'re going to get to
grav vehicle flight characteristics. Here are a couple of examples from
real world helicopter operations:

In cities (and other dense urban terrain) helicopter traffic is routinely
restricted to specific corridors. These have readily identifiable visual
reporting points and generally follow linear features, like roads and
rivers. Oncoming traffic (opposite directions on the same route) is
separated horizontally, usually by staying on one side of the linear
feature. Sometimes corridors are designated for one-way traffic only, with
the other direction some distance away. Crossing traffic is usually
separated by altitude and by positive control -- the crossing point is one
of the visual reporting points. Common frequencies allow all pilots to
track what is going on, and to cross-talk if necessary.

Most cities don\'t see all that much helicopter traffic, but places that do
- -- the Army Aviation Center and School at Fort Rucker, Alabama (which
typically has more air traffic actions logged in a day than Chicago
O\'Hare), the various Combat Training Centers (Fort Irwin, Fort Polk,
Hohenfels) during training rotations -- use essentially the same system,
under military control.

In areas where the traffic isn\'t so dense, most helicopters fly wherever
they want on a "see and avoid" basis -- the pilot is responsible to see
other aircraft, rotary- or fixed-wing, and avoid it. There are no-fly areas
posted on aviation charts, and I would generally rather fly around an urban
area than through it unless I have business there. 

The times that I\'ve flown into large commercial airports, the air traffic
controllers take advantage of the fact that we can fly anywhere and land
anywhere to keep us away from the fixed-wing traffic patterns. They
normally bring us in at right angles to the traffic pattern and below its
altitude, straight in to the base of the tower, and then direct us to
refuel or the fixed base operator from there. Small airports generally
prefer we use the traffic pattern, so they can keep track of where we\'re
going.

Of course, a helicopter on an instrument flight plan is just another
airplane (albeit a slow one) and follows the same rules, including flying
fixed routes and making standard approaches.

These comments apply equally well to the United States, Germany, Korea,
Somalia, and Haiti -- say TL5-8, Law 0-6. Extending them to other TLs and
law levels is left as an exercise for the reader.

If so, then here are some numbers for your review.

GTL10 Thruster Module (Short Term Access)
1 Space (480 cf)
200 sTons of Thrust

Fusion Reactor Slice
20,000 kW
2 sTons
80 cf

Thruster
20,000 kW
10 sTons
400 cf

12 sTons
0.6 MCr

Crew not needed due to short term access.

I just made a 50 dTon GTL10 fighter with 9G Acceleration using this 
thruster module.  And that was using the standard systems using 
Long Term Access requirements.

Any comments?

Sure.  However, it probably needs a full spacedock (rather than a vehicle bay) for maintenance, since a vehicle with only short term access can\'t be repaired from inside the vehicle.

It still needs short term access space.  This is two spaces, not one.

Well, we Vargr kept on fighting the Imperium after the Zhodani made peace
in the last Frontier War.  We\'re still fighting.  Hardly a month goes by
without some Imperial ship or world being raided.  So who\'s treacherous?

If the Zhodani ally with the pinkie-supremacists, they will be making a big
mistake.  We Vargr know who our enemies are.  Could the Zhodani withstand
the combined strength of the Vargr _and_ the Imperium?

On the question of fashion:  the cloaks the Zhodani nobility wear with
combat armour are really quite an excellent piece of \'Evil Empire\' chic. 
But of course no humans can the good taste and fashion sense of the Vargr.

I should point out that Zhodani Ugg boots are derived from a Vargr design,
as you can tell from the name.  Thank you for the Buni hides, though.

I used to work for the Papua New Guinea Electricity Commission.  There\'s a
lot of hydo-electric power used there, as well as diesel plants (the latter
particularly on islands).  They have done a lot of work with mini-hydro
plants, to provide power to remote areas.  These plants are very small. 
There\'s also not much of a national power grid - most of the country
doesn\'t have power.

When I was at university in Brisbane in the early \'80s, I lived across the
road from a big transformer.  In winter it used to attract possums, because
it was warm.  Every couple of weeks one would get to close, and explosively
cut our power off.  That transformer has since had a wire cage built around
it.

I\'m currently in the last pages of Kim Stanley Robinson\'s "Red Mars".  Great
descriptions of what happens with a dome blowout.  Even worse is when
terrorists hack into the physical plant and gradually start hyperoxygenating
the atmosphere in the dome and then popping a missle through the dome or
setting off a radio controlled spark.  *** POOOOF ***  Human torches
everywhere.  Ouch.

We had this discussion a decade ago (gad, time flies!).

There are two basic models to use for ATC. One is centralized, with each
vehicle under remote control. The other is ditributed, with each vehicle
under local pilot control but with a safety override (think of birds
flocking - a very simple neural net will prevent collisions).

Centralized models are easy - just think ATC.

Distributed ones let player maintain control of their grav vehicle, but
give the added fun of trying to follow someone in a crowd.

Which model is used is pretty much up to the referee - we came up evenly
balanced on advantages and disadvantages.


Two points you haven\'t mentioned: privacy and litter.

When anyone can fly anywhere, traditional privacy goes out the window. Your
neighbourhood teenagers can float past your bedroom window, ogle you in
your pool...land on your 200th story balconey...

As to litter, imagine those same teenagers in an open topped air/raft on
friday night, playing \'hit the target\' with their empties. Take your
average commuter traffic and litter, and then imagine in landing from
several hundred metres. Armoured umbrellas, anyone?  One solution owuld be
to have doors/windows that absolutely WON\'T open until the CG is turned off
- - but that only makes the game more exciting (turn off CG, open door and
drop empty, turn on CG before you hit ground yourself).

IMTU really advanced GTL10-12 worlds typically have extensive public
transportation in urban areas. Really local transportation is by slidewalk.
Area transportation is by maglev or contra-grav lift monorail. Of course the
**very** rich and government services use ground cars and air/rafts.  Auto
controlled taxis are also available at a modest price.

I think that the use of air/rafts on heavily settled worlds is also
unlikely. Maglev trains will be almost as fast. Transcontinental travel will
be via suborbital shuttle. The problem with letting grav vehicles go just
anywhere is that they **will** go just anywhere. I suppose that advance
sensor systems and computers could keep vehicle from hitting each other (and
the ground or buildings) but what will keep them from landing on my property
or a secret military base or somewhere else they shouldn\'t be.  Much easier
to just limit their use by both law and custom as the use horses and carts
were limited in ancient Rome.
Of course far outside urban areas, where the land is thinly settled will be
different. On large land estates and on farms (corporate or private) wheeled
or floating ground vehicles would probably still be used (likely power cell
powered), and air/rafts for utilitarian uses.

Not throughout ALL of america. I live in Alaska, which is (for the
unitiated) part of North America, and yes, a state of the US. Find the
Yukon and go west.

Some places are so cold, they don\'t shut the vehicles off at all during the
winter. I\'ve seen CO2 "snow" occur NATURALLY. (It\'s spectacular to watch it
fume when the sun rises... but don\'t go out for more than a few minutes
without 2-3 layers of wool over your nose and mouth, and sealed goggles
over your eyes.)

at least 10% of alaskans don\'t have centralized power. Many of the bush
communities still have those hand cranked WW II radios (battery life at -20
C is negligible....). Most of the communities in state are not on any
physical power or phone lines. Several stations STILL air "Letters" to
people in the bush, since much of the bush lacks mail, phone, and satellite
linkages.

And yet, people up here are much more familiar with how to survive without
power, phones, etc... because many (some 60 thousand plus) still do.
Despite the fact that most large villages have a lot of TV\'s, and home
generators. About the only community up here that would be affected
drastically would be Anchorage, and only if it got hit by a MAJOR cold
snap... (I\'ve lived through a 3 day blackout... while there was snow on the
ground, and daytime highs were below 0 C). The State and Local disaster
plans include provisions for a 10 day power outage during a major cold snap
(where daytime highs are -5 to -10 C!). Losing power not only did not shut
down the community, it didn\'t even shut down the schools. Most businesses
lost 1 day of work, some two.

The thing is that most alaskans have some form of back-up sources of heat
and light in home. Any city which had some kind of "field effect" air
retention system would probably also have some way of sealing the living
areas off in case of failure. Yeah, you loose the laws and gardens...

In more hostile areas, like undersea or the oft mentioned flourine
environment, you can be sure most buildings would be "hab-failure rated",
and many would have some form of decentralized power, and enough life
support for an evac... say, 4weeks or so. Even physical domes would have
these kind of "failure proofing" systems. Current subs and ships generally
have compartmentalization, for much the same reasons... a partial failure
is not always a catastrophic failure.

Lucky, lucky man. I\'m dying to see this one myself! Don\'t say anything other
than what you\'ve already said.

ObTrav: In my Traveller Universe the Darmine, for some reason, love churning
out horror movies which tend to be relatively popular across the Imperium. I

  FWIW, the CT progression of MP HE weapons (hmm..., Kenji?) from TL\'s C to
F clearly indicates that the OTU is still clearly limited wrt how much recoil
can be damped in a shoulderarm sized package. This has implications for the
idea of million-G airlock screens existing at normal Trav TL\'s.

They stopped production of it in favour of a comedy series called \'The 
Congressional Record\'.  Unfortunately, they stopped publication of that 
series about 1500 years ago after a 4 century run, but you can find back 
issues if you look for them.

AFAIK, QANTAS *hasn\'t* had fatalities secondary to crashing planes,
going back to the \'30s.
There *have* been a very few nasty injuries sustained by ground crew.

\'Ob Rain Man\' : We knew that Raymond wasn\'t regarded as \'normal\' because
he was institutionalised, among other things.

Ob Trav : The contemporary aircraft system is a good model for grav
vehicles. Aircraft are restricted to three dimensional corridors of
airspace and their movements very closely observed.
	The grav vehicle system will be highly automated - and control will
vary with law level, etc.

control system to go with his verticar....)

Energy or power density will scale with the fourth power of the absolute
temperature, according to Stefan\'s law. We are considering a
low-temperature system here, so this limits us to life with a slow
metabolic rate ; but the plant will be long-lived in the absence of
catastrophe because of this.
	Running (horizontal root systems like grasses) are indeed an
alternative to the system I outlined earlier, and more likely in the
absence of significant amounts of internal heat generation.

No, my point was (and I should have made this explicit) is that these
solvents may not be able to dissolve the salts we need (unlikely, as the
compounds listed have reasonable dipole moments, but there are always
exceptions to the rule).
 	This is a considerable hindrance in the early stages. Carrier
molecules would have evolved if these substances were vital to
metabolism, as the organism\'s ancestors got bigger (analogy : oxygen
transporters (haem and haemoglobin) in Earthly life).

In cosmic terms, elements heavier than zinc (atomic number=30) *are*
rare. For every hydrogen atom there is 10^(-6) oxygen atoms ; elements
heavier than zinc are at least one hundred thousand times less abundant
than oxygen.
	The \'rare earth\' elements (yttrium, lanthanum, etc.) are going to be
hard to find in significant concentrations on iceball planets (they are
called \'rare earths\' because they are present here in smallish
concentrations in exploitable deposits). Remember that in the outer
reaches of a solar system, water, ammonia, methane, oxygen, etc. will
freeze out over the top of any rocky or metallic body that\'s there.
	Having said this, there\'s always a chance of \'salting\' the surface via
collisions with other bodies (a rocky or metallic asteroid, say).

> An interesting thing to consider is how these plants might have evolved.
As I mentioned in my initial reply, life as we know it relies on energy,
building blocks and solvents.
The lack of an atmosphere is a hindrance rather than an absolute
prohibition on the development of life.
Consider Jupiter\'s moon Europa. It is pretty much a large iceball with
no significant atmosphere.
	However, thanks to the tidal heating produced by Jupiter, liquid water
may be present under the icy surface. So we have two out of the above
three requirements for life. If there is an appropriate set of building
blocks in the water, life is inevitable. It may only be single celled,
but it\'s life.

Subsurface microbial life is probably going to be quite common in the
universe.

	We don\'t need an \'atmospheric loss\' scenario, although the two
possibilities there are :- 
	i. Cessation of plate tectonics as the planet\'s core solidifies leading
to a lack of CO2 cycling (say) and slow atmospheric \'bleed-off\' ;
	ii. Abolition of local greenhouse effect (identical cause to (i) above
for borderline worlds), leading to the atmosphere freezing out onto the
planet\'s surface.

Evolution of the vaccuum flower? Subsurface microbes -> communities
formed to enhance feeding -> exploitation of temperature gradients as
another energy source -> increased gradient required as communities get
larger -> development of the \'flower\' part of the plant.

I prefer going the other way simply because the average spacing of
stars in Traveller seems rather closer than in reality.

Either way, I just plain *don\'t* see a brown dwarf as being at all
useful for scooping fuel from unless it\'s *really* old. Between the
*high* temperatures of the upper" layers, and the *humongous* gravity
field (leading to skim velocitys best not thought of) I don\'t think a
ship has much chance of surviving.

Is there any reason a brown dwarf might be unlikely to have "planets"?
Something Ganymede sized, and close enough in to stay warm might be
useful.

Not likely. Gravity is a *very* weak force. And air molecules at normal

Nope. And there *shouldn\'t* be the sort of "docking bays" you describe.
You dock *to* a station, not *in* it. 

It\'s not like there\'s weather to worry about. And there are lots and
*lots* of good reasons for *not* wanting ships *inside* a structure.
To name just one, at least *some* of these ships (*all* of them at
lower TL\'s) have *reaction drives*.

Check out the safety zones for a Shuttle launch. And the stuff they do
to protect the pad from the exhaust. Things like a *million* gallon
water deluge system. 

And for that matter, notice that seagoing ships do *not* go into
buildings, they tie up *alongside* docks, or even just anchor "nearby
(assume a parking orbit). 

Large aircraft don\'t go into buildings except from protection from bad
weather and for maintainance.

Sorry, but I just don\'t buy Star Trek\'s "Spacedock" and similar things
in Star Wars. Babylon 5 was kind of on the edge. They *did* allow
*small* ships inside, but most "parked" and used shuttles.

Dynamite (or let an "unfortunate" earthquake take them out) a couple
of pipelines in southern California[1]. And suddenly Los Angeles will be
stuck with a supply of water that can\'t last more than a couple of
*days*. And no way to get more in time.

It\'s a miracle that they *haven\'t* had a major outage of that sort yet.
And when it finally happens, things could get real interesting. 

[1] as I understand it, there\'s one from Northern California, and
there\'s the one that carries water from the Colorado. Without them, LA
can\'t meet it\'s *emergency* needs, much less anything else.

So you land it. Or you put it in a *drydock*. But that\'s not *normal*

Excuse me? The wireline phone system has it\'s own *independent* power.
We\'ve had week long outages without losing phone service. Cell phone
systems aren\'t that robust. They tend to skimp on backup power. And
most digital phone links do rely on public power, not on the phone
company\'s battery banks and generators.

The big one could be bad. But LA, like NYC is generally ignorant of
their biggest vulnerability. Water. They have *no* local sources worth
mentioning. They both get their drinking water from *hundreds* of miles
away (Northern CA and the Colorado River for LA, the Catskills for NYC).

This reminds me of the factoid that Luna could probably retain a
breathable atmosphere for somewhere between 10k and 500k years. And
that\'s "retain" in the sense that at the end of the timespan, it\'s no
longer *breathable*, not no longer *there*. Over *geological* time this
is nothing. 

So we could have an ambitious job of terraforming, or (just barely) an
old project of Grandfather\'s that still has a (barely) breathable
atmosphere and is being "refreshed" by nudging a few comets or
something to it. 

Nothing like hitting an exploring group of players with somethging
like this.

Sensor op: "Captain! This planet has a breathable atmosphere!"
  Captain: "I thought it was too small? Is it exceptionally dense?"
Sensor op: "No, I checked that. It\'s got a normal mass for its size.
            This atmosphere *can\'t* be natural. The computer says it
            can\'t possibly last more than a few hundred thousand years
            on its own..."

Sudden silence as everybody on the bridge starts wondering about *who*
is responsible for the atmosphere. And what *else* they are going to find.

Just a thought, but in \'Star Trek: The Motion Picture\', didn\'t Kirk beam up
to a space station, and was from there shuttled (by Scotty) to the refitted
Enterprise.  IIRC, the Enterprise was enclosed on three sides (top, left &
right) by a lattice structure which was just supporting lights, so that the
crews working on the outside of the hull had good lighting.

Again IIRC, didn\'t the \'Spacedock\' suddenly appear at the end of \'The Wrath
of Khan\'.  Its main purpose seemed to be to let the people who were sat
aboard the station drinking coffee see how badly damaged the Enterprise was
when she returned from the Genesis planet.
(Or was that at the start of \'Search for Spock\'?)

I\'ve posted some 7G designs.

In CT, grav compensation was limited to 6G. Indeed, gcomp varied by tech
level. I think that we need to clarify this for GT.

My preferred solution (without checking VE2, \'cause that\'s packed now) is
to have gcomp capped by tech level, with any Gs in excess of the comped Gs
requiring other means (gsuits, floatation tanks, whatever).

Just as long as the lessons of the "great blackout" back in the 60s are
still remembered. I know of two different hospitals that found out the
hard way that they\'d overlooked crucial details.

The first had just installed a nice, new emergency generator system.
The chief engineer saw the lights go out and confidently reached over
and pushed a button. And nothing happened. Their fancy generator had an
*electric* fuel pump. And no battery backup. 

They finally got it started by a moby kludge. They chopped a hole in
one of the fuel tanks, so they could dreged up some fuel. They took a
bunch of spare tubing and a funnel and went up enough flights of the
emergency stairs to get enough pressure head to feed to injectors. 

The second hospital had a better generator setup. It cut in
automatically and started running just fine. It was in a sub-basement,
near the East River. There was a lot of water seeping in. But no one
had thought to specify that the sump pump for the sub-basement had to
be on the emergency power panel. So the generator flooded out before
anyone realized what was happening...

Trust me. There\'s *alway* something you\'bve overlooked.

Unlike you youngsters, *I* am old enough to remember "The Great
Blackout" on the East Coast in the 60s. Power was out for *days* in
places. 

The usual reason was quite simple. A power plant needs power to run all
the instruments and controls. This isn\'t normally a problem, because
when you down a generator for repairs or maintenance there are "always"
several others up and running. And if not, you\'ve got tie lines to
other power stations.

Except this time. The way the blackout had worked, after the first
major tieline cut out, each plant facility in turn got presented with
the load the now disconnected generators had been handling. And this
ridiculously *huge* overload had immediately caused the safeties to
shut down the generators to avoid burning them out. So it cascaded thru
the system.

It stopped in places like the small power station where the tech on
watch took one look at the load meter for their tie line to the rest of
the system and violated standing orders by cutting out the tieline
*before* the safeties had a chance to cut in. So his plant continued
supplying their customers, an island of lights in the midst of an ocean
of darkness.

But in most power stations, they had everything (manualy) reset, after
determining that *whatever* it was, it wasn\'t their equipment. And
there wasn\'t any power coming over the tielines. 

The folks around the edges of the blackout weren\'t about to reconnect
those tie lines until they were *sure* they weren\'t risking their
equipment. Ditto for the few "islands" of power.

It was handled in different ways in different places. Around the edges,
they got folks to come in and double check things, and then they\'d
carefully, reluctantly, re-energized that tieline. And in a few hours
that station would have a generator up again, and slowly bring the rest
online. Then they\'d repeat the process with the folks they had tielines
to, who were still down.

In NYC (and other ports), they generally had at least one power station
at the docks, because it was so easy to get coal delivered that way. So
they\'d get a medium sized frieghter to tie up to their doc, and they
run a (*heavy*!!) cable out to the ship. Ships generate and use a
*lot* of electrical power. Enough that one can easily supply the power
required to bring up a "cold" power station.

In Boston, the local power company called MIT, hoping that MIT, with
it\'s own power plant might have a generator running. MIT had far more
powerplant than they really needed, because they used it to train
electrical engineers. 

Alas, they had,\'t had anything running at the time, and didn\'t even
have spare steam pressure they could tap from the heating systems for
the dorms. But they said "Give us a bit, we\'ve got an idea".

And since they had some truly weird setups *because* they had a
full-fledged Electrical Engineering proh\\gram, they could set up things
a normal plant couldn\'t. So, shortly, there was line of students
lugging car batteries into one of the labs. 

They got enough hooked together to feed the right voltages and
amperage into *something* and used that to get a smal generator on
line. A few hours later they feed startup power to Boston Edison.

So, yes you *can* have the power out for extended periods if the reason
for the failure is of the "we never thought of that" sort.

Though, as I\'ve pointed out in the past, I rather expect that power
generation is going to start trending back to a less centralized model.
So we may be more vulnerable now that 100 years from now.

More likely, as I see it is that there will be *local* grids. Inside
large buildings, you\'d tie the generators together so that excess
demand in one area can be met from slack in another area. Add some
decent batteries (says sodium sulfur, or some of the new reversible
fuel cells) and you can store power during slack times for use during
peak load times. This lets you get by with smaller generators.

It also means that even *small* generators will either have built in
tieline and battery load leveling cicuits, or else such will be
available as a cheap, standardized add-on box.

For residential use, I can see most homes in a village on a colony
having their own generator & batteries. But at some point somebody is
going to have excess capacity at a time when a neighbor needs extra.
And it\'ll be simpler to run a tieline to Charlie and make some sort of
deal.

I expect this sort of thing would evolve into a sort of power co-op
where the co-op owns at least some extra batteries, if not an extra
generator, and all the co-op members are tied into a grid. The grid
will track who is using more than the generate and vice versa. Charges
would be based on this. 

I figure this sort of setup would prevail up to "neighborhood" size.
Neighborhoods might have some limited tie-ins with adjacent
neighborhoods, as insurance, and in case they need extra (or have extra
to sell). 

I don\'t see any real point in any higher level organization to it. But
I think there *are* sufficient benefits to being able to "trade" power
at these two levels. The excess power from co-op A might get sold to B,
who passes it on to C, etc, until finally co-op Z on the other side of
town gets the extra power they needed to run a vitrifier to pave the
street. :-) Morelikely, they just bought a little from neighboring
co-ops, and that\'s all *they* know. The links between others would just
adjust the flows to compensate.

We lost power several times this spring because of birds landing on the
pole just outside my window. Seems that the way the wires ran, there
was an inviting perch that caused the bird to be positioned almost
perfectly to facilitate an arc between two of the wires. 

Zap! *BOOM* <dark>

The power crews didn\'t believe it was birds until about the third time,
when the bird\'s body had remained fairly intact and near the pole. I
was able to point it out. 

I\'m not sure what they did, but the problems ceased. At a guess, they
bent the wires so the "looped" a bit different.

Not true. The Hindenberg fire killed the passenger market. But the
US Navy went right on flying *their* airships for several years. What
killed *that* program was losing the Shenendoah and the Akron. Both
under conditions that made it quite clear that there was no practical
way to determine *which* storms were survivable and which weren\'t. And
since they didn\'t have the speed to *outrun* the storms, that pretty
much klilled them.

The basic fact was that dirigibles, even with *modern* materials, just
can\'t handle storm stresses. And even with modern weather prediction,
there are way too many areas where they can\'t outrun storms either. So
they just aren\'t practical.

Oh? Check out what happens to folks living downstream of a big dam.
Thankfully, we are *very* good at building these. 

Sure it doesn\'t kill everyone. But neither will a dome faiulure. To
start with, if they can afford a dome, they are unlikely to be the only
city on the planet. And I\'ll bet you a cookie that *in spite* of the
dome, the building code will require most buildings to be capable of
maintaining pressure even without the dome.

Even simpler. From one of Katherine MacLean\'s stories. Reverse the ion
polarity in the air regen system. It\'ll make people nervous and
irritable. And they\'ll want to leave. And they\'ll *hurry*.

In her story, it was an underwater city that was a burough of New York
City. And one of the people in such a hurry to leave "helpfully"
over-rode the speed governor on the elevator to the surface. And
someone else over-rode a safety, so they didn\'t have to wait so long to
exit the elevator after the car got to the top. With the result that
they got the doors open before the pressure had equalized. And the
entirety of the dome tried to squeeze itself thru the elevator shaft...
Yech!

I\'m sure it\'d be some *other* combination of well-meaning but ignorant
citizens trying to "help" that\'d cause the destruction of the domed
city on the vacuum world. But it\'d be just as inevitable. 

The biggest danger to *any* support system is the ignorance of the
general populace. You have to do your best to make sure that the
well-mening are never in a position to do something "helpful".

Not quite. They can explain several types of superconductivity. But
mostly the "colder" types. So they can predict that known mechanisms
aren\'t going to goive, say, roon temp superconductors, but they can\'t
showe that there aren\'t *other* mechanisms they\'ve overlooking that might.

Also, just about *all* metals will superconduct wonce they get cold enough.

If we didn\'t breathe oxygen we\'d feel much the same about it. It\'s a
*very* reactive gas, only biological activity (involving some pretty
clever catalytic dodges) allows it to exist in the atmosphere for
significant periods of time.

This is (sort of) easy to answer. I discovered that there\'s a unit
known as a "technical atmosphere" that\'s quite close to a "standard
atmsphere". 

1 tech atm = 1kg-force per cm^2. 

So the answer to your question basicly becomes how many cm^3 of air are
in a kilogram? That\'s how many cm tall your "column" of air needs to be.

Actually, NYC has this honking big river right next to it. There are water
treatment plants online that already pull in Hudson river water (which
contrary to popular belief isn\'t actually all that polluted...the PCB\'s that

It\'ll be tight, but there\'ll be water. There are also large reservoirs just
north of the city.

The inhabitants of Los Angeles have spent the last sixty years denying that
the live in a desert, and assuming that every drop of water west of the
Rocky Mountains is their\'s by some divine right.  A few years back during a
severe drought, they refused to enforce a ban on new recreational water
works construction (swimming pools, fountains.)  Los Angeles\' mania for
water in the desert almost killed Mono Lake, and they\'ve tried to drain
Northern California\'s wetlands on more the one occasion. (Nuke the
Peripheral Canal!)

You live in a desert.  Get used to it.

over access to and use of scare potable water resources.

Hmm ... Didn\'t think about that, however, it is still an alternative if you 
have a large carrier.  It would be interesting to see how a smaller 
fleet of heavily armored fighters (using short term access PP/Eng) 
would fare against a larger fleet of the "standard."

Doh!  I copied the wrong one to the email.  You are correct.  It still 
needs short term access.

Does Long Term Access give you access to the hull to make 
repairs there?  Does a vehicle bay?

A vehicle bay is 5% larger than the vehicle it holds, and is basically
form-fitting.  Imagine doing bodywork on a van in a garage with less than a
foot of space on all sides.  For long-term access, figure it is about the same
level of hull access as you have in a large water ship; you can do
\'maintenance\' work from inside, but major repairs are best done in a
spacedock.

GT Utility modules damp out 3G.

IF that\'s the case, then a GTL12 8 G ship would subject the pilot to 
5G.  I am not a modern day fighter pilot (indeed I am not a fighter 
pilot at all :), but I have seen documentaries where they handle that 
kind of stress and then some.  Just to pass the school they have to 
handle 9G for 5 seconds (IIRC).

I think you are correct, however.  We should have a variable comp 
per TL.

According to VE, it starts at VETL12 with 2G comp and doubles 
every TL after that.  So assuming that GravComp starts 2TL early 
(and uses 3G instead of 2G), then GTL12 should be 12G comp ... 
which I find a bit much.

Side Note: When GT first came out, I swear I read somewhere that 
GTL12 had 6G comp.  Was I daydreaming or is that really in there 
somewhere?  I haven\'t been able to find it since.

You\'re forgetting the lazy mind factor. Joe Store Clerk or Betty Lawyer
doesn\'t give a fiddly fart where their electricity comes from.  They want to
be able to turn on the lights when they need them. Its the same mentality
that keeps Microsoft on top and will prevent Linux from completely taking
over until some company starts loading on all their new computers so a user
can just turn on and start surfing. If they have to worry about load and
judging if they have enough power etc. they\'ll pay some big company to take
of the details. If that means a major power grid they won\'t care. The richer
a society is the less they\'ll care. Who cares about saving $20 a month when
you\'re making $300,000 a year?

It was the beginning "Search for Spock" that they were on the space station.
The docking area was not pressurized though, their was no "air field" like
Star Wars has. OTOH, in ST:TNG the shuttle bays and such did have those "air
fields" and I remember ST:First Contact, Picard and "whats-her-name?" were
running around on the enterprise and they found a room with an airfield
looking down on the earth.

I\'ve never pictured "air-fields" existing in Traveller. I can see docking
bays like the Star Wars Death Star, but the landing area is not pressurized
and people have to link up with the space stations docking mechanism, or
where vacc-suits to venture outside of their ship.

I\'d suggest:

Hybrid. While there is no equivalent of ATC, airspace is divided into
altitude bands, each for traffic flying in a certain direction

(simple example with four bands:

Changing direction would involve either a climbing or diving turn.

This system removes the need to simultaneously track a multitude of
vehicles, each controlled by someone with about the same aptitude as a
current car driver; while giving some degree of control to the passage
of traffic.

Basically true, because safety is expensive. For an example of what
happens when you really do let safety drive a design, look at the US
Navy\'s SUBSAFE programme.

Have you ever seen the refit complex at Rosyth Royal Dockyard? Or the
submarine refit complex at Devonport? Those seagoing ships go out of the
water and into buildings.

No - because we had concerns about our prole-analogues feeling it was

We decided to take the wise decision and play a long term game; sadly, we
could do with advance information when you next plan a Frontier War as a

Still, these are structures for *major* work. Subs and ships (and
spaceships) don\'t go into them to drop off cargo, they go into them
to get rebuilt.

The Star Trek universe has force field technologies as very advanced.
They even use them as part of large structures for load-bearing
(or at least load-assisting) elements - the Structural Integrity Fields.
For a society that has so much skill with force fields, putting up a
field that holds in atmosphere should be an easy task. Once it\'s easy,
it becomes common usage - instead of someone asking, "Why are
you taking that ship inside to work on it?", people ask, "Why don\'t
you take it inside?".

FWIW, it wasn\'t clear to me that the interior docking areas of Spacedock
were pressurized. Perhaps they just wanted a "garage" with opaque walls,
so they could take apart top-secret warp engines without some spy with
a telescope taking pictures?

<hoping there are no instrument flight examiners online to catch me if I
screw up...>

The current ATC system (FAA and ICAO) specifies flight altitudes in
controlled airspace (virtually everything more than 1200 feet above ground
level) as follows (all bearings in degrees magnetic):

Instrument flights:

	001-180 	even thousands + 500 feet (2500, 4500, 6500, etc.)
	181-360		even thousands

Visual flights:

	001-180		odd thousands + 500 feet
	181-360		odd thousands

Aircraft are required to maintain assigned altitude +/- 100 feet, providing
300\' of separation. The gaps and distances double above 14000 feet (e.g.,
35000, 37000, 39000 feet in one direction). One could eliminate the
visual/instrument difference and proceed using quarters as you suggest.

This is one place where I expect technology, in the form of automatic
altitude holding gear, to improve ATC performance. I\'d expect the
permissible error in altitude and the separation between altitudes to get
smaller, perhaps as little as +/- 25 feet and 100 feet of separation (or
metric equivalent). This might let you stack flight levels 150 feet apart.
They won\'t get any smaller than the maximum dimensions of the aircraft that
are supposed to use them, however.

Just because the idea got me thinking, I seem to remember a conversation I had a
long time ago (in a country far far away) with some of the astronomy crowd I
used to go drinking with... We were talking about Europa (for more info see
http://www.anu.edu.au/Physics/nineplanets/europa.html ) and its lack of of
surface features due to a probable layer of ice atop a layer of liquid water.
What was keeping it liquid was the subject of debate, and the going theory was
massive tidal or tectonic action induced by the close proximity of Jupiter.

You can probably see where I\'m going with all this. I think it would be at least
feasable (if not probable) to have a planet with a molten core, a nice _deep_
layer of water (like tens of kilometers), givinplenty of room for some good
gaming possibilities, with a layer of ice on top, orbiting a brown dwarf close
enough to make for enough tidal agitation to keep the water liquid, but not so
close as to have the planet trying to turn itself into a asteriod belt.

Whaddya think?
Cheers, Mike.

Be real careful about Spoilers please.

The Independant Film Channel show "Split Screen" did a story on
them about 3-4 months ago.  Its Episode 10 of Split Screen.

Having seen some of the backround stuff on this film, I\'m pretty
sure that early on, some key information was inadvertently leaked,
so I think I\'m already spoiled, so I won\'t talk about it anymore
than to ask for [Spoiler] headings on such posts.

I recall a 1970\'s TV Movie/TV Show, _Fantastic Voyage_ (IIRC). It 
could have been an inspiration piece for the current _Sliders_
series - in _Fantastic Voyage_, a group of people are trapped in 
some kind of dimensional vortex in the Bermuda Triangle, and deal
with all sorts of societies and worlds in their attempts to get home.

A person who joins their group turns out to be from an advanced
future society. He shows the group an image of his home city,
a massive arcology much taller than it is wide, surrounded by what
looks like wilderness. 

His people use their advanced technology to limit their impact on
their planet. They deliberately compress the "footprint" of their cities,
building upwards instead of outwards. Connections between the
cities are by air, and use of any advanced technology on the ground
is strictly limited due to environmental concerns.

While never explicity stated, this social decision to be limit technology
while on their planet\'s surface is probably the reason this individual was
so good at woodcraft and survival - not skills one would expect in a
member of an advanced technological society.

Oh, but there is! Radiation surges from solar flares, microasteroidals, and
of course, Trash. Considering docking relative velocities, and the relative
difference between main thrusters and RCS thrusters in power,
dangerousness, etc, that argument doesnt wash well.

true, but not a particularly good comparison. Traveller ships have
canonically had all the options available... including internal docks at
the high port if small enough. IMTU, many high ports use a repulsor system
to maneuver the ship into place in the bay... you park outside, and they
bring you in. The bay doors are seldom closed, and the bay is kept in
vaccum, but it provides microasteroidal and radiation protection for doing
exterior work, as well as being a safety net in case you shear your tether
and allows shirtsleeves through much lighter weight crawltubes. Plus, at
launch, they push YOU out... And it is much easier to run the standard data
and power connections.

To a certain extent, the Star Trek "Spacedock" of the movies bugs me, too.
Not for the scale, but for the design which wastes sooooo much space. B5\'s
bay has a tiny opening, but is primarily for passenger craft and small
cargo lighter. But still uses their own thrust!

Traveller, since HG, has had some repulsor tech... I\'ve had the perfect
reason to force turnover of a PC\'s ship to a remote control from the
station, too....

IMTU, a typical "Full Size" bay for a high port can hold up to a 5000T
ship... it is a 10KTd bay. Many more diminuitive bays (holding 1 ship 500Td
or smallrer, 1000Td) are used. A- and b-Class High ports with navy bases
might have a 200KTd "Tunnel" orbiting nearby for similar purposes for large
ship repairs... it provides light, micrasteroidal protection, and radiation
protection, and is a fly-through tube with sliding doors at the ends...

Mind you, docking fees vary by type IMTU. Typically,
100d orbits Cr100/week
10d orbits Cr100/first week, Cr15 per extra day
External Soft Dock: Cr 5 per hour. (this assumes running lines and and a tube).
External Hard Dock: Cr100 per day, first week only Cr500
Internal Hard Dock: Cr150 per day, flat rate.
Airdock : Cr500 per day, plus Cr500 for each repressurization

all prices assume 100-500Td Costs tripled for 500-2000Td (two to four per
large bay), and x10 for 2000-5000Td ships. Tubes are generally military use.

It would really help other people\'s (ie, non-alaskans) if the weather
stations weren\'t at the airports, which get the most even heating of most
areas, and most sit on the edge of a mjor water body. And remember, central
alaska is due east of siberia....

Fairbanks, wher eit occasionally get CO2 snow, also typically gets to the
upper nineties at least once during the summer. No major water bodies to
moderate the climate. Surrounded by mountains on all sides. peak day/night
lenght 20 hours.

Ease of maintenance & Safety. 

Is it that expensive? 

You can pump most of the atmosphere into adjoining sections or tanks, prior to
opening the doors. Cheap.

You can replace lost oxygen by electrolysis of a small amount of water. Nitrogen
you would have to take in tanks I think. [Aside: Is it OK to use gases other
than Nitrogen as the "inert" component of air?]. Your standard life support
should be
able to handle this. Cheap.

Life support - atmosphere recycling - is only required for air that is breathed,
which wont change whether the bay is open or closed. All that is required, above
what you already have, is ducting & heating. Cheap.

You need an enclosed bay - enclosed by hull metal - to protect crew from
micrometeorites and radiation - so no saving to be made here.

Spacedock door mechanisms and seal are cheap (5KCr in GT).

Artificial gravity costs 300 KCr for a 500DT bay. Expensive.

So the only expensive bit is the artificial gravity. If you want to save money
you could use thrusters for gravity during the time you needed it, and dispense
with the artificial gravity.

However, I think you need the grav compensation so that you can manouver safely
with ships in the spacedock. It would be unpleasant if a 100 DT ship came loose
during a manouver. X-boats cannot manouver by themselves.

So it\'s a very tall landing bay...

OTOH Have you considered using shrink wrap technology? Cover landing bay door
with high tech version of strong, see through, self-sealing, plastic/rubber
sheeting. You probably need to use a double layer for safety. Ship lands on
sheeting and pushes against it until it lands on the deck. Another sheet is slid
over the door space. First one is released. Presto - ship has docked with no
loss of atmosphere. 

A similar process is used for take off. Lower sheet is reattached to door frame.
Air is pumped out of gap between sheets (leaving a bubble wrapped ship!). Upper
sheet is retracted. Ship departs with no loss of atmoshphere.

You still have a problem with micro-meteorites and radiation though.

Plus, for places like Tucson, Arizona, they\'re in the middle of vast
expanses of black runway, in the flattest part of the city as far from
the mountains as it\'s possible to get. It\'s not unusual for our official
temperature to be up to 10 degrees hotter than if measured actually _in_
the city.

Last week we had thunderstorms that flooded several parts of the
city...the airport registered 0.02 inches of rain...

The rain gauge here at the U of A, which is in the central part of the
city, registered 1.78 inches...

    'month' => '07',
    'index' => 'ds276',
    'body' => 'TMLers:

 Over a year ago on the TML I had proposed writing a program that would
allow users to create, organize, and maintain star systems for Traveller.
I was going to use the program as a programming project for my degree.
Unfortunately, the proposal failed to get an okay, and I had to come up
with something else fairly quickly.

 School is behind me now, and I expect I will have a little more spare time
to work on something in the near future.  So, I am again proposing to do an
application that allows users to build star systems and maintain them.
What I am looking for is a high-level discussion of the features that need
to be included in this project to make it as useful as possible to as many
people as possible (while still keeping the work required manageable for
one person\'s spare time).  I am a long way from having a testable product
of any type, but I want to see what features are required/desired/useful.

 My main goal is to put together an application that will keep track of an
extensive level of detail on each world/moon in the star systems and
provide some level of larger-scale organization.  Here is a summary of
features I have thought of and/or recall seeing mentioned when I last threw
this proposal out on the list (more-or-less in stream-of-consciousness order):

  1: Decent user interface (as opposed to no UI or a bad UI).
  2: Command line batch capability (for mass production).
  3: Create, organize, edit star systems.
  4: Keep track of lots of detailed information (computed automatically), such
as temperature, surface acceleration, eccentricity of orbit, radius, density
(and all those other things that players may not have much use for, but
provide
a lot of color and/or filler in handouts).  This would incoporate components
from WTH, WBH, and Accrete (and, since I just found out about First In, maybe
components from it -- I ordered a copy at my FLGS Monday & hope to see it by
this weekend).
  5: A higher-level system of organization (sectors, or pocket empires, or
some
such).
  6: Allow different system generation rules, such as canon Traveller, the
adaptation I did of Accrete, 2300AD (I think there\'s one for it, I just don\'t
remember it), the alternative Traveller system 
( http://web.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/house/altWorldGeneration.html ),
and/or First In.
  7: Flexibility in organization: allowing either standard Traveller sector
organization or 3D Cartesian coordinates.
  8: Extensibility: Allowing user-defined "trade codes" that can be manually
set for a given planet (examples from TNE include Ancients\' Sites, Xboat
stations, Naval Depots, and so on).
  9: Continuing on the flexbility/extensibility theme, allowing user-defined
allegiances (so one is not set into a particular flavor of Traveller).
 10: The ability to export data to text files of varying formats with varying
degrees of detail.
 11: The ability to import data from text files of varying formats (for
example, a sector listing in standard Traveller 80-column format, or a text
file output from Accrete).
 12: There was also a request that the data format be compatible with
Galactic.
I have not really given Galactic a rigorous scrutiny, but I don\'t know that
using the Galactic data format will give me the level of detail I want;
allowing data to be imported/exported is a more likely solution to that
request.
 13: On line help.  Context-sensitive help would be a plus.

 Here is a question that I have about a feature I am not sure about:

 Is there a need for referee notes (or some other text blurb(s)) to be
incorporated into the info?

 For those of you wondering about the target platform that this will run on, 
here is a summary of my position on that subject.  I am willing to discuss or
debate these views outside the mailing list, but I don\'t want to chew up TML
bandwidth on a platform war.  I will include a brief note on my position for
each of these for anyone curious.  These are listed in contingent temporal
order (in other words, barring problems with a given platform, this is the
order of development/porting).

 1: Development in DOS/DOS-window-compatible 32bit DPMI using the TurboVision
TUI.  Why?  I can concentrate on underlying functionality without the learning
curve of the UI interfering.
 2: Port to Linux.  Why?  Because the code will be written in GNU C++; there
is, IIRC, a port of TurboVision to Linux.  There should be a minimal effort to
port.
 3: Port to Win32 console app.  Why?  There were many concerns expressed last
time I proposed this project because I was using a 32bit DPMI, although I have
_never_ had any problem getting this type of application to work in Win95 or
WinNT 4.0.  This port is contingent on my being able to port the TUI into
MicroSoft\'s flavor of C++ and getting it to work as a console app.
 4: Port to Win32s.  Why?  Because there are a lot of people who want a Windows
native application.  I put it on the bottom of the list because I still don\'t
do Windows.  (It\'s one of the many benefits of firmware engineering)

 Once I have a fairly good list of specifications to work with, and some people
who are willing to discuss the specifications at a higher level (off the TML), I
will determine whether the project still looks promising.  I will put a new
spec sheet together and post it at a later date.

 As an aside: Yes, I will want testers eventually.  Also, I plan on releasing
this project as freeware, and I will likely release the source code.

Aside from its impact on architecture, I feel that the real impact on cities 
will simply be the result of grav transport.  We have seen a trend in the US 
that as travel becomes easier, more and more people reject an urban existance 
(although there will always be a hard core of urbanites).  I suspect that 
ubiquious grav technology just might accelerate this trend and result in 
"cities" that spread over vast areas like a sort of super suburb.  Many 
worlds will develop relying on gravitic transport form first settlement.  On 
such a world I doubt if the citizens would ever make the sizeable investment 
in roads and other ground transportation systems which have arisen to support 
present day cities on Terra.  Instead they would be free to spread out, yet 
still reside and work a conveniently short time from the amenities of 
advanced civilization.  It is fun to imagine arcologies and gloomy

Actually, he was a secondary character, but still the same old peacenik that he played in WOTW.

FWIW, I actually *liked* the last season of WOTW, but they left a *LOT* of loose ends when they stopped production.  The alien\'s bio-based tech was *COOL*.

Helium is currently used by deep divers... Most of the Noble gasses (the
rightmost collumn of the Periodic Table) are breathable in low enough
partial pressures.

Oxy-Helium runs O2 at IIRC about 1psi PPO2, and up to 30 or 40 PSI PPHe,
depth dependant, again IIRC. Helps to shorten decompress times, as the
nitrogen in the system is limited to what you carry in inside the
bloodstream and tissues. prebreathing is used.

Nearly Pure o2 at levels of 2 PSI is fairly safe to breath; provided enough
CO2 is present to regulate breathing.... NASA does it almost every
spacewalk.

To be honest, Recycling only uses as much o2 as is consumed, assuming of
course a properly designed system, but needs enough machinery to handle the
total volume in a steady changeover. Plus, if you plan to reuse the bay
volume of atmosphere, sufficient pumping equipment to depressurize to near
vaccum, which is best handled by treating it all as habitable volume.

Which is why, IMTU, most "internal" docking bays are not pressurized. Nor,
for that matter, are they equipped with a "Down" direction... they are
simply enclosed berths so that ships can be hooked up with less "durable"
(in the sense of armoring to withstand solar wind and orbital debris) (and
also thus less expensive) connections and tubes. It also allows workers to
have more and better lighting, and have the use of construction arms (much
like the shuttle\'s) for moving big parts. Plus, I allow the ships to go to
base-provided power for internal LS, computers and gravitics, as well as
external consumeables.

Just for reference, IMTU, a private bay can be purchased at Regina SkyPort
in the annex for roughly 1MCr for a 1KTd bay... with an annual cost of KCr
1 for "Association and Control Fees", plus Cr1 Air tax per week per person
going to the main station. They simply build a module, and tack it on to
the "String". Works much like a condo association. Court Duke Hamford\'s is
a 1000 ton bay, in a 1100 ton box, with a public corridor through it... and
in the bay space, he has installed a "Hab Module" of 100 Td, and it\'s own
life support, commo, and computers, and a half dozen staterooms. Plus his
400Td "yacht" ( Type XT modified Jump-6 Experimental) and (when they are in
Regina) Xen\'s Type S. It\'s crowded, and uses a 50T repulsor bay for docking
control (from the station\'s part, controlled either from the hab module
(when manned) or "String Docking Control".


One other benefit of enclosed docks: crooks neet to get into the bay to
gain access to the ship. Something which Starport security takes a dim view
of...

I like the thought of your proposal. W/out getting into platform silliness

port it to odd ball OS\'s - such as MacOS (currently use) or Amiga Dos (used
to use). This is just about as least a common denominator as you can get and
still have acceptable functionality. WIN32 in all it\'s forms, OTOH, has some
really nasty assumptions when porting time comes - at random I\'ll simply
mention big vs little endian...

I\'ll also post this to the list so that if anything I\'m not aware of exists

Of course this _is_ all only my opinion and worth exactly what you paid for
it...  ;\')

On my webpage I have a description of life in Atora, capital of Regina.
There\'s also a description of the Starport. None of it is canon, though I
don\'t think any of it downright violates canon either. Yes I realize
contra-grav belts are GTL12 and Regina is GTL10, but I would expect such
small, useful devices to be imported, just as electronics are typically sold
to countries of Earth that cannot manufacture them.

Sorry, no-one _lives_ in a place where CO2 snow occurs naturally.  The word
is _exists_, surely.

OBTRAV:  Whenever I generate a PC for myself I always specify they come
from somewhere warm, preferably tropical.  This is because I really hate
cold weather, even of the rather mild kind we get here.  As a result my
\'fantasy\' alter-ego tends to hang about where it\'s warm, and moan and gripe
when it\'s cold.  

Combat Environment suits are a really good thing in cold climates, though. 
I allow a civilian version, that\'s not armoured and lacks the chameleon
option.

We Vargr would like that information too, so we can sell it to the

Besides, we\'re the only ones who have actually beaten the Imperium.  The

So sorry to contradict my fine fuzzy colleague, but the only sophonts
who have decisively beaten the Impies have been the Impies themselves. 
I find it amusing that they were so easily manipulated into beginning a
multi-sided civil war, with each side so evenly matched that there could
be no true victor.  The Solomani scarcely needed any manipulation at all
to dive on in and attempt to "retake" their so-called birthright (for
all the good it did them...).

And whoever the ...uh... sophont was that manipulated the Impies into
developing Virus was truly _brilliant_!  This one development (along
with the "Empress Wave") brought down nearly _all_ interstellar
cultures, with _one_ major exception....

Two.  The Regency survived as well, relatively unscathed.

  Lose most of the Sphere to the Impies (who actually are made to look 
attractive compared to you vermin, except that they\'re adjacent to us),
and then have Terra devastated and occupied (some master race...) - fine,
the Imps are now confident that you\'re halfwits and economically crippled
to boot; so what do you do for an encore?

Definitely nice to have.

The star system data file should be something like Galactic or Traveller 
Tools format.  Personally, I prefer the Traveller Tools format.  No offense, 
Jim.

This could be done by generating system files for each occupied hex in the 
sector map.

Sector files would be good enough.  You can put an index file of all 
created/converted sectors as a seperate file, so if you wanna view the next 
subsector spinward, and it\'s in another charted sector, the index will find 
the right sector.

I\'m absolutely 100% for the alternate generation rules that Joe\'s got at the 
Missouri Archive.  That stuff just makes *sense* to me.

I\'m not so worried about 3D as I am standard traveller format.

This can be done in the master utility configuration file either folded 
directly in, or as one of the menu choices to load up.

Absolutely a must.

This would be an extension of #11.

Traveller Tools compatibility would be a Good Thing as well as the GEnie file 
format, which is pretty close to TravTools.

Depends.  I like notes on what\'s going on, myself.  You can tie this into the 
regular system files on an occupied hex basis.

Yeah, there\'s a TV port of Linux already in place.  It\'s part of the Free 
Pascal Compiler project.  I haven\'t had the chance to play with it much yet...

Definitely sign me up for it when it\'s ready to port to Linux.

There\'s an old sci-fi book called "A Hostage for Hinterland" by Arsen
Darnay, which has a series of cities like this all hovering above ground

Speaking of which, please forgive my ignorance, but are there any

are some examples?

In the 1952 copy of "The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology", edited
by John W. Campbell Jr, The first story listed is "Blow-ups Happen" by
Robert A. Heinlein.  The edition of this story as it appears in this
book, is from the original magazine story written with info based on
what was known in 1939.  Later versions were edited to update them to
current knowledge.

This story was first published in 1940.

Fluorine makes oxygen look rather tame, Leonard. Check your CRC Handbook
or look at the history of fluorine chemistry.
Moissan who eventually isolated the stuff, after some *heavy duty*
electrolysis got the Nobel in Chemistry for his effort.
Most of his predecessors who attempted what he did were either seriously
injured or killed!

Photosynthesis is energetically expensive. The analogous process for
fluorine synthesis would be even worse, requiring some intriguing
biochemistry (if possible at all).

The noble gases would be an expensive alternative to nitrogen.
I would not use these in a shirtsleeves environment. Xenon acts as a
general anaesthetic with partial pressures in excess of 0.7 atmospheres
and the other members of this family may have similar problems.

Do what the deep sea divers do and go with helium-oxygen mixtures, or
just use air, it\'s cheap.

I wish you the best of luck. I am currently working on a similar project, so I know 
from experience how challenging your feature list is. For the record, if you manage to 
pull it off, your package will be more impressive than my own. I made some tough 
decisions on what would/would not be added - in the interest of simplicity.

Also - your system appears to be standard Traveller based, while mine is based on GURPS 
Traveller First In.

Some advice - feel free to take it or leave it...
  1) Have your own data format - but import/export others. Trying to shoehorn in your 
own data structures into an existing format almost never works - you place limitations 
on yourself. But the ability to read TravTools or Galactics files is a great boon to 
swing users to your product :)
  2) Start small, but from day one build your program to be extendable. Its much easier 
to debug. Start with the core rules first, then add the rest. If you try to do the 
whole works at once, chances are you\'ll never finish.
  3) The platform wars - here\'s the icky one. In all the years I\'ve been a programmer, 
this is one of the nastiest elements of programming. Here\'s my views
   a) If you\'re in it solely for money, go Windows. I am not a microserf, but I know 
the market shares. If you\'re interested in solely a profit margin, the Win32 platform 
is where the big bucks are.
   b) If you\'re writing for yourself and are going to share it with others - then the 
choice is simple - use the system that you prefer. If you\'re giving your stuff away, 
_no one_ has the right to complain about "Why isn\'t this supported" (a pet peeve of 
mine).
   c) Consider cross-platform. You mentioned TurboVision - I\'m not familiar with that 
product. Someone else mentioned Curses. I myself use Java. But a warning - to truly 
write cross-platform, using any of these techniques, requires a great deal of 
discipline. You can\'t just write in a cross platform language/environment - you also 
have to follow certain techniques. Otherwise, you won\'t really reach your goals.

I hope the previous stuff doesn\'t sound egotistical - I\'m only offering advice. Take it 
or leave it.

I\'m working on a program dealing with GURPS First In system generation. Here\'s the 
specifics (* means finished)

  Java 1.2.1 based for cross-platform purposes.
  *Generates a complete sector: stars, planets, moons and all.
  *Includes all First In data planetary data, including cultural.
  *Every object is editable, and can have notes attached to them.
  *Command line mode for batch generation (not editing).
  Graphical UI (Swing based) to allow editing. (about half done).
  *Native file format based on Object Serialization
  Can convert to/from standard Traveller UWPs (convert to is done).
  Export: Text & HTML (GURPS or Standard). Plans for TravTools and Galactic.
  Import: Text (Standard). Plans for TravTools and Galactic.
  Operates as both an applet and an applecation.
  *Extendible architecture based on Java Interfaces.

Some people may wish to know when this is going to be released. Well, Steve Jackson 
Games has a pretty tight reign on their properties (and I think this is a Good Thing 
(tm)), and I will not be able to release until I get their permission (which I will not 
attempt to get, until its done). So, I can\'t offer a real timetable.

However, I will probibly be looking for beta testers here Real Soon (tm), so if you 
have access to a Java 1.2 VM and are interested, please let me know.

Best I can tell, there isn\'t one (yet). The manuscript has been submitted,
but the playtest board is still open for comments. There has not been a
general announcement on the status of GT: Starports in weeks. It is
possible that the timeline has been extended, but with GURPS Space 3/e and
GURPS Traveller 2/e both in production I doubt Loren has had much time to
spend on it. Look for more information in the next couple of weeks.

Recommend that you go ahead and post your feedback to the board, *after*
reading the comments that have already been submitted (yes, I realize what
a pain this is -- I\'m only halfway through the 800+ messages on G:Space 3/e
myself). The authors will probably still be able to incorporate what you
post.

</factoid>

With cheap, small fusion power plants, every family could roam a planet
in their almost self-sufficient grav home (now that could be an ATC
nightmare!).
	The factors that will determine \'centralised\' vs. \'scattered\'
population distributions include : attitude to the environment, the
level of government control over the citizenry, whether individuality or
group behaviour is valued more highly, cost, etc.
	Economics and sophontology become more important than technological
capacity per se (at Average Stellar+ tech levels things are relatively
homogenous in the environmental control sweepstakes).

Hmm....
Would someone be interested in starting a \'Sophontology 101\' discussion?
(a.k.a. \'Cultural Development for Dummies\'??)
For example, Glenn Grant mentioned he had written some interesting
anthropological material at the beginning of the year.

Come on, it\'s time for the resident social scientists to educate the
unenlightened masses! You know you want to...

More signal, less noise on the TML!

And without those reservoir, the treatment plants wouldn\'t be adequate,
would they?

BTW, they find anything "interesting" in the old water tunnels when
they drained them? Or is that still a ways off yet?

*They* live in a desert. I live in Oregon, thank you very much. Within
sight of the Columbia River. And I recall that at least once, there was
an attempt by California to steal *that*!

I\'ve lived in much drier areas too. Eastern Washington, and some
camping in Central Washington. Lot\'s of *weird* terrain mixes. Sand
dunes and sagebrush, right on up to the edge of a meadow that depends
on a stream (to give just one example).

Given fusion power, water reclamation will be a lot easier. 

The funny thing is, it\'s the world\'s with *breathable* air that\'ll have
the worst water problems. Anybody in a closed environment, or even
merely a protective suit and breathing mask is going to be recovering
exhaled water and perspiration as a matter of course. And unless y\\they
grow their food locally, they\'ll actually wind up with a *surplus* of
water:

	"food" + O2 -> H2O + CO2

No need to nuke them. That\'d ruin what\'s left of the local ecology.
Instead, just block couple of pipes and a canal and don\'t let them
repair them.

I\'d be *really* interested to see what LA might look like if they were
*forced* to use the landscaping laws that are common in places like
Arizona. 

Basicly, you landscape with *native* plants. And use minimal amounts of
drip irrigation if needed.

The only places you see large expanses of grass are either *old*, or
set up for sports fields. And I understand that they pay some *large*
usage fees for the *privelege* of maintaining these alien ecosystems.

        Ahem.
        It is this very level of disinformation spread by you lesser races
that irritates we Chosen Ones to action.  That the Imperials seek to elevate
their self-esteem by denegrating the fine society that we have forged for
ourselves is telling of thier own self-confidence.
        The entire idea that a non-charismatic leader can pull you around by
your little pink snouts because of some *un-earned* and totally contrived
title is dazzling.  The anarchy you percieve within our borders is the
simple, on-going re-alignment of a healthy and vibrant culture that changes
as the times do.  Those worthy of being followed, lead.  Those not worthy,
follow.  
        These conditions are not constant, entrenched and stagnant.  The
very nature of the Galaxy in which we live *mandates* change, and it is only
foolish to believe that a leader can lead because his sire could.  Leaders
and followers may swap places if the tides of unfolding history require it.
        Your Admiral-turned-Emperor Plankwell was a Vargr spirit in his
understanding of this.  You cherish his boldness and foreward thinking in
understanding this very ideal.  Yet within us, you call it belittling names.
You are surprised when we act to correct you, thinking it is still more
characteristic of the "anarchy" you see in our great state.  Most of you do
not even understand what "anarchy" really means.
        Look inside yourselves for the causes of the arrival of Corsair
above your planet.  Not within us.

1 atmosphere pressure is approximately 14.5psi.
Normal air is approximately 21% oxygen - the partial pressure of oxygen
is therefore 2.9psi.

Gas mixtures containing less than 2psi of oxygen will cause marked
hyperventilation (Resting ventilation is about 7L/min at 2.9psi partial
pressure of oxygen. The depth of ventilation *doubles* with every 0.1psi
fall in the partial pressure of oxygen!).

The aims with heli-ox or (any gas mixture, I guess) are to :-
maintain normoxia, minimise the work of breathing and prevent inert gas
narcosis, oxygen toxicity or the \'bends\'.

So with really deep dives you can get to the stage where the fraction of
inspired oxygen is 1% - but its partial pressure is still about 3 psi.

Interestingly, hydrogen has been suggested as an alternate inert gas for
really deep diving (obviously oxygen is a very small percentage of the
gas mixture!).

You don\'t need to rebreathe CO2 to regulate breathing. The carbon
dioxide and oxygen carried in your arterial blood do the job very nicely
(removing all the CO2 from your blood as it passed through the lung
would do terrible things to blood pH).

Space shuttle EVA suits are pressurised to 4.3psi (~1/3 atm) of 100%
oxygen.

With regard to oxygen toxicity, I posted some information earlier :-

From all my run-ins with Java, I have learned to hate it.  Even Windows

I wouldn\'t count on it. *Many* people, even now are doing things to
generate some of their own power, partly to reduce bills, partly
because they don\'t like the way the power companies are producing the
power.

A world that *starts* as a small colony with folks generating their own
power is *very* unlikely to switch to the other model. 

Once you get the neighborhood level co-ops in place, it actually
becomes possible to have some houses and other facilities that *don\'t*
have their own power. They just live with always owing money to the
co-op. 

But major power grids *can\'t* compete in such an environment. At worst,
you\'d get as far as a central power unit for each "neighborhood". It
just plain isn\'t *worth* shipping power from more than a mile or so
away. Not with fusion power units. The line losses make it cheaper to
expand the substation, or add more batteries (depending on whether the
problem is "peak" load or base load).

A power room would likely by a part of standard house plans on most
Traveller worlds, just like a coal bin used to be for houses in much of
the US at one time. 

It\'s a tradeoff between "Gee, we can buy a 50 kW unit and sell any
excess to the co-op. Or we can buy an 8 kW unit, some battery banks,
and only have to buy power if we are using *all* the heavy load stuff
at once. Or on the third hand, we can go with just the 8 Kw, and buy
"peak" power all the time."

That\'s the sort of decision you make when *building* a house.
Contemporary equivalents might be choosing *how much* air conditioning
you can afford, or between various types of central heating/central air
and a heat pump. You consider what the initial installation costs are,
and how much they\'ll cost or save over the next 10 years or so. 

If you are *buying* a house, you try to get an idea what the monthly
bills will run, and whether or not you can save some money by replacing
some appliances, including furnace or air.

Or you may have been living there a while and decided to see if you can
save some money by upgrading something. Heck, depending on the mix of
other houses & businesses in the co-op, you might even be able to
*make* money by installing a bigger than you need unit and selling the
excess to the co-op.

The stuff with load balancing and the like is going to be automated,
expect with the possible exception of "warning" signals if you are
drawing too much power. That\'d be something the homeowner would tell
the computer after being *shocked* by the size of the power bill. "Let
me know when our power draw gets above XXX". 

Kep in mind that in the downtown areas of many cities, heat was *free*
until recently. The old steam power plants got a lot of good will by
dumping "spent steam" (only 150 C or so) into pipes going to nearby
biuildings. The buildings (as much as half a mile or more away!) got
free heat in the winter. And it didn\'t cost the power company anything.

I recall the mad scramble when they pulled such a plant out near the
Portland waterfront back in the 70s. A number of places suddenly had to
worry about what it would cost to heat their building in the winter.
And where to install a steam heating system, or should they just rip
out all the steam radiators and install forced air, or electric?

So don\'t expect that the sort of costs *we* have to worry about will
always be there, or always be handled the same way. 

BTW, sure most folks making 300,000/year *don\'t* worry about a measly
$20 expense. On the other hand, the sort of place they\'ll be living in
will have *much* larger power bills. And you dont make that sort of
money by ignoring the possibility of making money. 

It might be simplest for them to put in a generator that can handle the
max load they ever expect to put on it, and then some. But *somebody*
is going to pioiunt out either that it\'s cheaper to use a smaller unit
and pick up peaking power from the co-op grid, or else that they can
*sell* the excess to the co-op grid.

Ok, I skipped making a joke about the atmosphere in Quebec, but, sheesh...
Australians. I lived in Sydney for almost a year and it\'s incredible how
lazy Australians are about indoor climate control. Gaps under the door big
enough to slide a Sunday newspaper through, single pane glass, single doors
(as opposed to the separated "airlock" type double doors we have here) into
shopping malls - hell, most houses in Sydney didn\'t have heaters! It was,
ironically, a hell of a lot colder in my apartment in Sydney at night than
it\'s ever been in Canada.

As one resident of a beer-drinking nation to another, it never gets cold
enough to put your beer outside at night - contrary to what the weather
reporters down under would have you believe.

Didn\'t they have something like this in Tarsus? Or was that the stock CES?

I am surprised that it gets cold enough for CO2 snow in Alaska, but I remember
quite distinctly from the info in Tarsus that it would occur at the poles
there quite regularly.

It might be intesting to compile a list of geological features that effect
weather so that GMs can have something more accurate to estimate surface temp
from other than just latitude, like lakes, mountains, etc.

Time consuming. Check out the sort of pumps required. It takes a long
time to pump *anything* out to a near vacuum unless you use a pump
almost as big as the volume you are pumping out. 

> You can replace lost oxygen by electrolysis of a small amount of water. 

Not *that* small. Check out what a cubic meter of O2 weighs. Then
consider that you\'ll need 9/8ths that mass of water to generate the
replacement oxygen.

Yes, but doing so has various drawbacks. Mostly, the fact that they are
both expensive *and* they change life support conditions *drasticly* by
their very presence.

Helium is a bout the only "common" gas that\'s *possible* to use. And it
is both hard to obtain, and *leaks* thru holes that nitrogen and oxygen
*won\'t*. It\'s also a nightmare for lifesupport. It conducts heat
*dozens* of times better than nitrogen. Which means that you either
crank the air temp up to 90+ degrees, or you wear heavy clothing all
the time, or *both*.

And if you are using biological components in your lifesupport, they
won\'t be happy with the lack of nitrogen.

> Your standard life support should be able to handle this. Cheap.

*Small* losses, yes. Not large ones. Consider that "100 tons" is 13,500
cubic meters. A "mere" 1% loss is 13.5 cubic meters of air. 

Also, if you store the atmosphere at 100 atm pressure, that means you
need 1 dT of volume *inside* the storage tank for every 100 dt of space
in the bay. And that tank is resisting a force of almost 27,400 *tons*
attempting to break it open. 

> Life support - atmosphere recycling - is only required for air that is

Sorry, but you just flunked life support 101. You have to circulate and
filter *all* of that air. Otherwise it can accumulate toxins, get
depleted in oxygen, or otherwise be Very Bad News for anyone exposed to
it. 

HGeck, just look at buildings on earth. Even *huge* ones. They have to
process the entire *volume* thru the heating/cooling/filtering system.
Not just the miniscule amounts that the people are actually *using*.

That "ducting" has to be able to handle high pressure air as you pump
out the bay. It also has to have pressure seals that isolate the bay
from the rest of the ship when you pump it out. 

And heating and cooling loads are just astronomical. When you fill that
bay from the storage tanks, the air expanding from the tanks cools as
it expands. With the result that unless you take *major* steps, that
air will be at subzero temperatures. 

And when you pump it *back* into storage, compressing that air *heats*
it. You have to dump that heat somewhere (and now you know "why" it
gets cold upon expanding, it\'s trying to gain all that heat you took
away). 

Also, what temperature is the surface of the ship that has been brought
into the bay? The air contacting it is going to absorb or lose heat
*fast*, until the hull and the air are in thermal equilibrium. 

And if it\'s hot enough, you\'ll get air reacting with the hull metal and
depleting the oxygen. If it is *cold* enough, you\'ll get oxygen
condensing out of the air (a double threat, first because LOX is a
*major* fire/explosion hazard in the presence of *any* organic
materials, and most *metals*, second, because it\'s depeting the amount
of oxygen in the air), 

> You need an enclosed bay - enclosed by hull metal - to protect crew from

Micro-meteors can be stopped by enclosing the work area in several well
spaced layers of aluminum *foil*. The meteorite hits the foil and turns
itself and a small amount of the nearby foil into plasma. Which
disperses well before the next layer of foil. Astronauts wear a kevlar
"coverall" over their suits for micrometeorite protection *now*. 

Radiation isn\'t a hazard in most places most of the time. You place the
work area behind a slab of shielding and you are safe from solar
flares. You are "shadowed" from the source. Shadow shielding takes a
*lot* less mass than a bay. 

If there\'s any alternative, a station/spacedock will *not* be inside a
plantary radiation belt. So that hazard is eliminated.

I\'ve shown above that there are a *lot* more expenses involved.
Starting with the fact that not only do you *have* to provide life
support, but it has to be "heavy duty" to handle the huge temperature
swings, and all the fumes, dust, etc kicked up by actually *working* on
the ships.

Then add in the costs of the storage tanks for the air that you use to
fill the bay, plus the ones to account for losses. And the high
pressure plumbing to get the air to and from the tanks. And the pumps
(and cooling) to pump air into the tanks. When releasing the air, it\'ll
take a while to fill the volume. And you\'ll want diffusers to encourage
the streams of air to spread out in all directions. Those are cheap.
The heaters aren\'t. 

Be glad that we aren\'t *liquid* breathers. They can\'t compress their
"atmosphere" enough to matter. That makes for *real* hassles.

The classic story of living in a *really* extreme climate is "A Pail of
Air" by Fritz Lieber. I recommend it as an exercise in mind-stretching.

The means he uses to get the protagonists into the situation is
probably less likely by modern theory than it was then. But it\'s not
*impossible*. 

The techniques they use to survive seem workable, if rather limited. I
leave it to the rest of you to come up with a way to set the situation
in the traveller Universe. :-)

Actually, they should have limited version of it. White, to retain heat
at night, dark absorb sunlight during the day, and several bright
colors (say Yellow, Red, Orange, Green) for rescue situations or where
it\'s necessary to tell at a glance who is where.

<sigh>

For the umpteenth time. 

The G-loads in a fighter *aircraft* are quite different from those in a
fighter *spacecraft*. And all because the *spacecraft* has to use the
thrust of the main engine to turn. There\'s no air to "bank" against the
way an aircrft does.

In the aircraft, the G-load is generally from head to feet, except for
a few manuevers that have it in the opposite direction. Neither of
these is a good direction for the body.

In a space fighter, the g-load will be from *front* to *back*. That is,
it\'ll seem like you are laying down. In *this* attitude, the limits go
up *considerably*. I don\'t have centrifuge data handy, but I\'m fairly
sure that the "limit" for 3gs in this position is *hours*. 5g would be
harder but still not that bad.

Contrast this with the head to foor loads, were the limits are in
*seconds*.

New York built their "pipes" before we had modern steels. So they are
essentially *huge* tunnels through the rock. 

When they get Tunnel 3 finished, they are planning to drain Tunnel 1
(for the first time since it was completed back in the 20s or 30s!) and
check it out. God only knows *what* they may find in there. 

And I think that after they check out Tunnel 1, they may be planning to
refill it and drain tunnel 2 for a check.

I rather like H. Beam Piper\'s ideas on the subject. He had the
buildings get wider *and* taller, but not *too* extreme. As I recall, a
mile high was about as high as anybody went.

The buildings had aircar "landings" all over the outside, as well as
large internal passages that you could fly through. And vertical shafts
as well. 

I seem to recall grav-bikes being popular for getting around inside the
buildings. 

The buildings were *widely* seperated with parklands filling the spaces
between them.

I dealt with those in another post, but here\'s a brief recap. Most
micrometeorites will be *destroyed by impact with the equivalent of a
sheet of aluminum *foil* or mylar film. You use several layers, spaced
a meter or so apart so that you don\'t have to replace them as often
(it\'d take one strike in essentialy the *same* spot on each layer to
get a pentration). 

Larger objects will go right trhu, but then, they\'d blast a hole in
normal hull materials too.

Radiation is easily solved with shadow shielding unless you are in a
radiation belt, and *nobody* is going to stick a facility in one of
those unless there\'s no alternative.

It\'s the main thrusters that you are *worried* about. They can be fired
inadvertently, or deliberately. Doing so inside a dock will kill many
people and ruin the dock. 

Doing so while tied up alongside will cause some minor damage and get
you fined.

None of those are that hard to do *outside*. And frankly, you get a
*lot* more ships docked for the same amount of materials if you use a
"spar" design rather than a "bay" design. 

Central station "body" with a bunch of "docking spars" extending out
from it. The spars contain transport capsules, walkways, and various
sorts of wiring and plumbing. Ships dock to the spare and standard
umblicals attach, as well as cargo and personnel transfer tubes.

If needed, you deploy the foil shields "spinward" of the spars. And the
spars can be built with radiation shielding placed such that ships are
in it\'s shadow. Though that would be pretty much reserved for repair
berths. For normal berths, the ship\'s hull is enough shielding.

Historical note: Back in the teens the Arizona National Guard was sent to

allowed them to pump more than their allocation from the river.  The LA Times 
despatached their war correspondent to cover the action.  No shots were

Well, without the reservoirs, dependence on the the treatment plants
alone would result in immediate _serious_ water rationing in NYC, true.

AFAIK, they haven\'t drained the old tunnels yet, they\'re still working
on the third aqueduct tunnel. They have to have that done, because the
valves on the old aqueducts haven\'t been shut since the aqueduct opened;
they\'re not at all sure they can close them, much less reopen them if
they do.

      What they have found so far is that those tunnels leak.  A lot.
It will be a major undertaking to reseal them.

     The water billing system in NYC doesn\'t put much pressure on them to 
do so.  NYC residents are not billed on actual water usage.  They are 
billed for the number of faucets they have.

Compressed air (surface mix) becomes O2 toxic at 289 ft.  Nitrogen
Narcosis becomes a serious likelihood below 150 ft.  Decompression is
and issue and useful bottom time drops to < 5 minutes at depths greater 
than 130 ft.

Right. This is why commercial deco (decompression) divers use custom
mixed gases.  Their PPO2 at depth is equal to:

    PPO2 of the mixture at the surface X (depth in ft. / 32)

The 2 most common custom gas mixtures used for deep commercial diving
are HeliOx (Helium w/ > 2.0% Oxygen) and ArgOx (Argon w/ > 2.0% Oxygen.)
For *really* deep dives (> 1,000 ft.), a variation used is HydHeliOx
(Hydrogen, Helium, and Oxygen.)  The hydrogen becomes the favored bulk
gas because of it\'s low tissue binding properties (it is absorbed slowly
and released quickly from muscle and body fat.)  This greatly aids
speed of decompression.

BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!! 

Not even here, in the Socialist Republic of Tucson, Baja Arizona do they
get away with _that_! We have something like 37 new golf courses that
have been built in the last twenty years or so, all watered with potable
water. 

Granted, most new houses are being landscaped with native plants and
drip irrigation, but mostly because it\'s cheaper to install, looks much
better when newly built, and _much_ easier to maintain for the
homeowner. Most importantly, though, it doesn\'t die while the developers
guarantee on the house and landscaping is still in effect. 

That and the homeowner associations in the new subdivisions are
specifying exactly how everyone\'s home is supposed to look, down to the
paint colors allowed.

Where _most_ of the people in Arizona live, Los Angeles East, aka the
Phoenix Metropolitan area they still irrigate lawns by flooding them...

The only way they regulate water use here is the old fashioned way: they
raise water prices. Or try to. Each time they have done so in Tucson, at
least, there have been serious, and once successful recall campaigns
against the politicians who implemented the rate hike. 

(That one time they recalled all the council members, we got a city
council composed of one-issue amateurs, who somehow didn\'t realize there
was more to running a city that rolling back a water rate hike...that
they quietly reinstated several months later because we _really did_
need to raise water rates.)

It _has_ focused attention on the problem, and we\'re in the middle of
another one...the big brouhaha right now is over the use of Colorado
River Project water. Currently Tucson gets all of it\'s water from
groundwater sources, and we\'re pumping those dry.

But the city water utility completely and utterly f**** the introduction
of CAP water the first time. They got the chemistry _very_ wrong, and
caused a lot of the old cast iron pipes to start shedding rust. They
first implemented the changeover in an old part of town (of course you
test everything on the slums first, doesn\'t _everybody_???) and that
caused a lot of people\'s pipes to get clogged, forcing them to redo
_all_ their plumbing.

Then they swore up and down that the brown mud dripping out of the pipes
was first, \'normal\', then \'something that\'ll go away soon\', and only
after the fourth or fifth house had been flooded by burst pipes, and the
first 8" main burst, \'...uhhh houston, we have a problem...\'

After that the voters passed a referendum saying the city wasn\'t allowed
to deliver CAP water to consumers. The water utility basically ignored
the referendum, and went ahead with plans to fix the problem. This lead
to a _second_ referendum, and this fall there are going to be three or
four referendums on the ballot about the issue; we\'re electing a new
mayor, and several city council members, and the fighting is going to be
as ugly as I\'ve ever seen, because the honest truth is, we have no
choice. 

We can either stop _all_ development (a sin worse than baby-eating here
in cementhead land) and force about 2/3 of Tucsons population to leave,
or deliver CAP water to consumers.

oBtrav: 

(Uhh, Eris, you can stop reading this now. NO...really, what I\'m saying
here is of NO concern to you.  ;-)

Want to make life difficult for your PC\'s? Forget about Imperial court
politics, the Rebellion, squabbles between different Empires. The
absolutely dirtiest, meanest, most vicious politics imaginable occur on
the local level. 
The worst political fights are over who is the dog catcher.

Land your PC\'s and their cargo of imported water treatment equipment
into a local firestorm over the use or availability of the polluted
water the local water authority wants to use that equipment to clean up,
so they can use it as drinking water.

The populace see this as feeding them tainted water, and are pissed
about it.

We\'re talking sabotage, backstabbing, under the table deals, and lynch
mobs with ropes and pitchforks. Grandstanding politicians, and yellow
journalism.  

And it\'s all local, hands off stuff to the Imperium. In fact it\'s so far
beneath the notice of the Imperium the PC\'s might as well not
exist...too bad their cargo was burned, they were clapped in a dungeon,
and their ship confiscated, or worse...

Sure. Now find an envoronment where free oxygen is as rare as free
fluorine is on earth. Note that oxides, even *mineral* oxides, would
have to be fairly rare. 

Turn loose some oxygen in that environment and the results will be
rather surprising. Oxygen is *not* a tame chemical.

Yeah, it\'s just a wee bit toxic. And since they hadn\'t yet learned that
fluorine will form a *protective* fluoride coating on metals like
copper and nickel, they wee all using *platinum* equipment. *Ouch*.

That *is* the catch. That, and the fact that fluorine is just plain
*rare*. Like lithium, it\'s just a wee bit *too* good as a nuclear fuel
to exist in large quantities. 

My main intent was to remind folks that the existence of free oxygen in
huge quantities would be a rather surprising thing if we didn\'t live in
such an environment.

Thanks for your great real world examples.  In the readers\' exercise
with which you closed, we have to turn the facts you presented around,
to reflect that the majority of vehicles in high tech level societies
will have the essential characteristics of helicopters (i.e., they can

(CNN) - NASA\'s next rover can leap small buildings in a single bound but
weighs just a little more than Superman\'s cape. 

Unlike its Mars-touring cousin Sojourner, the latest rover, called a
nanorover because it is so small, is being designed to hop around an
asteroid
measuring a kilometer, or about a half-mile, in diameter...

Engineers at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are refining the advanced
rover in preparation for a mission called MUSES, overseen by the Japanese
space agency and set for launch in January 2002. The trick is learning how
to drive on an asteroid. 

"You\'ve got the same problem as a car on Earth on a sheet of ice," said Don
Yeomans, NASA\'s project scientist for the mission. "There is very little
friction between the wheels and the surface." 

"So you can creep along at 1 millimeter per second or you can take these
enormous leaps, and that\'s the preferred mode of operation," he said...

Actually, the NASA use is rather a better use of the word-element nano- than

Ah, that\'s even better!  I guess GT fighters just got leaner

I live in the Phoenix Metro Area-  Older neighborhoods do have
irriagation, usually using water from the Colorado River delivered via
the Central Arizona Project (CAP) Canal.

New homes have sprinklers and drip systems.  I live in a 2 year old home,
and many of my neighbors have grass instead of desert landscaping.  

Also, Tempe, which is one of the towns in the Metro area just *built* a
lake.  They wanted a waterfront and built collapsable dams 1 mile apart
on the Salt River (BTW-The Salt River only has water in it for a few
weeks every couple of years).  Then they used CAP water (I think) to fill
this lake.  And this is a "drought" year.

I\'m having mail delivery problems, so this response has bounced several
times:

I joined the military because I realized that due to my lack of applying
myself in high school, lack of rich relatives, etc... I couldn\'t afford
to go to college.

I also realized that I needed to do something-staying at mom\'s house and
working at Circle K or whatever was not a good idea.  So I went to the
recruiter.  

He must have seen me coming.  Despite being offered a variety of jobs I
thought that the "Vulcan Cannon Gunner" looked "fun" and enlisted for
that job.  I also signed up for Airborne School.  In retrospect this was
not, perhaps, the wisest decision. 

I served in the United States Army for 5 years.  I was a Vulcan Gunner
for the most part (the Vulcan is a 6 barreled, drum fed 20mm cannon which
can fire 3000 rounds (HE, HE-T, etc...) a minute.

After 5 years the Army was phasing out the system I worked on.  I had two
children and a wife.  As a E-4 (Corporal) everyone I new was on food
stamps, including my gun battery commander (0-3).  I elected to leave
active duty so I could get a job to support my family in what I felt was
an acceptable fashion.

I was assigned, for the most part, to the 3rd Armored Cavalry in Fort
Bliss, Texas.  I went TDY (Temporary Duty) to Korea, Panama, and Germany.
 I went with the Regiment went to Saudi Arabia and Iraq.  I was later
assigned to the 25th Light Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks,
Hawaii.  I also went TDY to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas.

I hope this answers the question/need for why someone goes on duty,
etc...

In a major hospital in South Africa, an intensive care unit kept losing
patients from the same bed. They\'d be alive the night before, but die during
the night and as far as they could tell the equipment was fine (I believe
they swapped all the equipment around to make sure). Apparently this went on
for a couple of years before they worked out what had happened. 

The night cleaner had unplugged the ventilator each night so as to plug in
her floor polisher. 

But given the fact that most monitoring equipment would scream like a
banshee when it was plugged back in as there was no pulse, this is probably
an urban myth. 

Ob Traveller; Character\'s are hired to investigate the death of a patron\'s
relative who died in a hospital due to equipment failure. The characters
find out more than one has died and in the ensuing investigation discover
massive corruption or organ peddling . . . but at the very end realize that
all deaths that occurred in the bed where the patron\'s relative died, were
due to the relaying of power from nodes powering the emergency life support
equipment to the automated floor polishers.

It was as a stretch, but somehow I managed to bring it back to Traveller.

<wailing, gnashing teeth>

ARRRGH! The term "urban myth" does not equate with falsehood or truth, nor
does the term "urban legend" for what it\'s worth. An urban legend is just an
example of the folklore that is transmitted in modern day industrialized
societies.

It\'s not an urban legend because it\'s untrue, it\'s an urban legend because
of the way it\'s been transmitted.

Ummm.. Okay. I\'ll go back to my cage now. Everyone else gets to have their
nitpicks, biology, physics, what have you. I\'m a folklore geek. ;)

As I believe I read (huge news here in Oz when it happened), a few of the
sick and elderly did die because of the widespread outages.  This was mainly
due to lack of heating(??) and not being able to care properly (not
preparing proper meals, etc.) for themselves adequately.  I really don\'t
have details simply because I never read the full reports.

Also, Victoria, Australia had a crisis with the major gas supplier going
off-line for more than a week where people (again, sick and old) died for
various reasons brought about by the gas outage.

Sorry I couldn\'t add more, perhaps someone more local to the disasters might
be able to add something?  Keep in mind, these deaths were only a very
slight fraction of the populace of these places, but the whole cities lasted
quite well on average.

Yep, that\'s the other side of the world for you.  Central heating.  Who

I haven\'t looked at Tarsus for a while, though I seem to recall something
of the sort.  There\'s stuff on this in a couple of places.  Oddly enough,
it doesn\'t seem to be in Mission on Mithril, which just happens to be
sitting next to me.

Yes, that would be handy.  There\'s a considerable drop in temperature
between Brisbane and Toowoomba, where I live, although they\'re only about
80 miles apart.  It occasionally snows in Stanthorpe, not that much further
inland, in the mountains along the Queensland/New South Wales border.  I
don\'t go there.

My preferred climate is somewhere like Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea).  Of
course, it gets cold in the PNG highlands, but they\'re pretty serious
mountains.

Hmm, maybe that\'s why I like the Vargr - they\'ve got fur!  Still, that
mightn\'t be a good thing on a world with a decent climate - even though
they don\'t sweat?  (Do they?) 

Anyway, different climates will result in differences in how people dress,
and stuff like that.  Even in controlled climates, like those on worlds
with unbreathable atmospheres, there may be differences in how the
temperatures are set.

And a last thought, aren\'t there advantages in launching rockets from
locations near the Equator?  Would this still apply in a grav-oriented
society?  Would it tend to encourage starports and early colonies to be
located near the equator?  Would this result in \'tropical\' climates in many
smaller colonies, with limited seasonal variations, even when the all year
round climate differs drastically from Earth norms?  Just a thought.

Not to mention a fair chunk of Aslan, pretty much anyone to spinward - the

And indeed, Arbellatra understood the great contribution that the Vargr can
make to the Imperium, in her dealings with the mighty Soegz.  We should not
forget that once the Vargr flew through the sky of Capital.  Of course the
pinkies try to forget this, but without Soegz, and his Vargr followers,
Arbellatra would not have come to power.

I haven\'t seen any GURPS Traveller material in the town where I live.
Neither FLGS stocks much GURPS (it doesn\'t sell well here; one of them is
trying to get rid of what they have left by marking it down to US$6 per book).

Anyone have any idea what the mix of Traveller flavors in play on the TML
is?  I recall that T4 seemed to be somewhat dominant when I was last
lurking on the TML 18 months ago, but a lot of GT seems to be receiving
discussion now.

>  1) Have your own data format

This has been my experience, too.  There\'s just too much I want to keep
track of, and I have yet to see anything out there already that will meet
my needs.

>  2) Start small, but from day one build your program to be extendable.

I\'ve started this project at least six different times over the last five
years.  I have enough "small" components lying about that I could assemble
them all into one big one.  I\'ve learned a lot between those projects and
my experience at work, so I have a better idea of how to do this project
and maintain the level of detail I want.

>  3) The platform wars - here\'s the icky one. 

Yup -- I got an earful (as it were) when I last proposed this to the TML in
January of 1998 since I had decided that Windows was not my first choice
for the product.

>   c) Consider cross-platform. You mentioned TurboVision 

I am using a GNU C++ compiler for starters.  I\'ve already received a
suggestion that I consider using UNIX curses (which I may do when I am
ready to start porting away from TurboVision).  TurboVision is a product
Borland released with ~v3.0/3.1 of their DOS C++ compiler.  It provides an
event-driven text-based UI.  It\'s also now public domain and has been
ported to the environment I use as well as Linux.

In any case, thanks for the observations.

The main problem is that, at least with Galactic, there doesn\'t seem to be
a way for me to keep track of everything I\'m wanting -- the data structure
for an individual world (or moon) in the pre-prototype I have is about 140
bytes long as a binary file, ignoring the space I\'m alloting for the system
name.  I haven\'t seen Traveller Tools yet -- should I go track it down?

This makes sense, and simplifies things for standard Traveller uses.

Yes, but I run a heretical TNE campaign based on the 2300AD Near Star List
(along with a T4 Pocket Empires for some higher-level organization, and a
handful of other Traveller editions and non-Traveller material).

>Shall I start a list at Onelist for this?

Is Onelist a list server?  I don\'t think there\'s enough bandwidth (right
now) to warrant a separate list.  That may change if enough interest is
generated.

What I mean by \'star system data file\' is, the file that holds the bare bones 
system information like yeah, there\'s a gas giant here, yeah there\'s a port 
here, here\'s the main world stats.  You can reference the rest off of files 
that are indexed to occupied hexes.

For the indexed files, say you have a system at 0404.  The raw data file 
would be called something like 0404.dat, any ref\'s notes would be 0404.txt, 
etc, etc, etc, all in a directory that uses the sector\'s name.

Personally, like I said before, I *LIKE* Trav Tools.  The ref for it is 
http://www.iinet.net.au/~mickb/Traveller/software.html.  Mick hasn\'t upgraded 
it in awhile, though.  It was \'summer\' down under, and they\'re just getting 
into winter real good now.

It\'s pretty much the way Galactic does things, and Trav Tools has something 
simular.

Yeah.  I\'m on 14 different lists there, 5 of which I moderate.  I like the

Actually, we don\'t neccessarily know this. What one does is de-pressurize
when going into combat situations.

Whether that\'s done by explicitly evacuating the interior or by venting
probably depends on the design.
I suspect  it would be simpler to vent and then regenerate the atmosphere
than try to evacuate and store it.

On the other hand, if you have a combat ship and it does depressurize,
everyone needs to be in vacc-suits running on pumped oxygen, so it is likely
that all stations and staterooms will have piped oxygen anyway, because you
don\'t want to use suit gas until you have to.

For redundancy,and especially in military ships it would make sense for each
area, may be each room,  to have it\'s own oxygen supply, but for ease of
replenishment, it would make sense if these system were all connected to
some centralized point as well, with automatic pressure seals.

I suspect, though, that all the systems would automatically be isolated on
going to battle stations, or any emergency..

allocation of the Colorado River is a case in point.  It is my understanding

it\'s waters are highly over subscribed by various U.S. interests. Mexico,
being at the end of the daisy chain, has historically been literally left
with the leavings and is none to happy about it.

Various parts of the world; Mexico City, Venice, Houston, parts of
California have experienced significant subsidence due to excessive pumpage
of ground water.  How significant you ask,  in parts of Mexico City
subsidence since 1950 has been on the order of 5 to 10 meters, Houston has
subsidence districts to control pumpage,   reportedly some aqueducts in
California have had to be rebuilt otherwise they might flow the wrong way.
In various arid regions of the world ground water withdrawals so exceed
recharge that it is clear that current usage and thus populations are not
sustainable.

Acid mine drainage from 19th and early 20th century mines in the American
West is a continual problem.  Reportedly improper disposal of brines from
early oil fields has made shallow surfical aquifers in parts of Oklahoma and
Kansas unusable for the foreseeable future.

Diversion of waters flowing into the Arial Sea by the former Soviet Union
has reduced it to a fraction of its former size and left it little more than
a brine lake.   They had plans to divert south whole rivers flowing into the
Arctic Ocean.  They were talking about blasting through mountains with
atomic munitions.  I don\'t know what has become of the projects but I can
tell you that the climatological consequences of such terra forming projects
are relatively unknown.

In various coastal regions of the world withdrawal of groundwater and the
cutting of drainage canals have resulted in salt water intrusion such that
well fields have had to be abandoned and alternative sources developed.

A few years back I attended a lecture at the Geological Society of America
Convention in Boston where the presenter provided evidence that a measurable
portion of global sea level rise in the last hundred years can be directly
attributed to man.

Where does this leave us as far a Traveller scenarios you ask.    How about
both the potential and real effects on an indigenous planetary population of
rapid global climatic change due to the engineering efforts of an
agribusiness affiliate of a megacorp.  Lots of potential for a straight
David and Goliath type confrontation, plenty of opportunity for skullduggery
with suppressed evidence which, if only the old professor can be gotten to
the science conference to present,  will set the matter right.  If not,
rapid sea level rise or fall, desertification or glacial ice age your pick.

I think that you should have a section on historiography as well.  It
would address the question, who has known what about the Ancients and
Droyne, and when have they known and not known it?  

I\'m interested in such a discussion.  I doubt that there would be any

Java was a great idea.  Its implementation was less than stellar.  And when

If you don\'t use IE, Java has a tendancy to not work so well.  Could be cause
a lot of sites use the M$ version of Java rather than the Sun version.

Oh!  I forgot about that!!  And people did die from that one too!!  But that

That\'s just because G:T is the only current Traveller product in production 
at the moment.  T5 should be out sometime at the end of the year I think.

From my copy of Book 2: Starships (apparently a relatively early
printing, since at least the pirate encounters change [or so I am told]
in later printings):

**begin quote**

Decompression:  Starships (and non-starships) depressurize their
interiors before combat whenever possible; the passengers and crew
resorting to vacc suits for safety and comfort.  This procedure
minimizes the danger due to explosive decompression as a battle result. 
In some cases, selected areas may remain pressurized...while other areas
are depressurized. (pages 34-35)

**end quote**

Book 2 goes on to discuss the various areas that can be individually
regulated, the effects of hull decompression, and the save throw to don
a vacc suit in time.

  I\'ve argued that capability at least in warships, but it doesn\'t follow that 
it\'s cheap or that a ship can do so for the docking bay that contains it.

Why would you want to devote an entire section to these guys?  They are just
"drones" who were rather uninteresting prior to the emergence of
Grandfather.  Did they even have jump drive before Papa Smurf came along?
Have pre-ancient era Droyne colonies been found?  Was there a passing group
of starfarers who "uplifted" these guys?  I mean, they must have learned
their trick somewhere, right?  Hmm, maybe I\'m just raising too many
questions and not being much help ;-)

I have a few more comments on the other items, but I\'ll hold off until I\'ve
boned up on the subject a bit more.

Shhhhh!

Part of the magic of a movie that is supposedly an accurate portrayal of
real events is that people walk into the theater thinking that it\'s an
actual portrayal of real events! Fargo, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc.

Sheesh! ;)

I bet you go around telling everybody that the Jerry Springer Show and pro

Traveller 3D material out there yet ;)

On a serious note, you\'re talking about "the suspension of disbelief".  If a
flim maker can suspend the disbelief of the audience for the amount of time
that they\'re in the theater, then they have truly done their job.  "Blair
Witch", though it\'s a small independant project, has garnered coverage in
several of the trade rags so far, was at Cannes (the filmakers got in
trouble for their flyers that were mistaken for real "missing" posters :)
and I wish them the ABSOLUTE best of luck!!!  Everyone should go see it to
support good independant film making!!!!

OK Todd, when are you going to write a good story for us to do our own
independant film to capture Cannes?? ;)

That is the common usage but the common usage is not always the "correct"
usage. Then again, the common usage can become the correct usage if it
becomes common enough. Witness the fact that the new millenium was welcomed
in at the start the year 1000, and will be welcomed in at the start of the
year 2000.

The terms "urban legend" and "urban myth" have nothing whatsoever to do with
how much the story has mutated through transmission. This happens with all
folklore, it\'s not limited to urban legends.

They don\'t appear courtesy of the internet. Most of the ULs that are
transmitted on the internet today have existed for a decade or more. Others
incorporate the same themes but are quite different. The internet is not
responsible for their existence, just their recent popularity, which has
fortunately been waning.

I say fortunately because it\'s a damper on the oral tradition. It seems that
everybody wants to be that guy who is just one UL ahead of the other folks
at the local bar, ready to assert that the story just told is false

"Oh, that one\'s an urban legend! I read it on Snopes!"

And yes, folklore will continue to be transmitted orally in the Third
Imperium. There\'s no doubt about it.

The surviving folklore from the age of sail covers a heck of alot more than
just "here there be dragons" and colorful recollections of foreign customs.

It also helps if the viewer thinks it might just be real. A local paper did
a review of the film and like 1/3rd of it was "ways you can tell that this

There is an article in Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society about
this.  It\'s called something like, "Giving the Bank a Fighting Chance."

> starships.  How would that work under Imperial Law.  

Imperial law governs the space between star systems, and, to some
extent, space within a star system, as well as starports.  That\'s where
any starship would normally be found.  As long as you have authorization
from the bank, you won\'t be charged with piracy or hijacking (or charges
will be dismissed with full exoneration).  "Unnecessary roughness" is an
issue of course.  If you shoot up the passengers, they\'ll sue you, but
you might also face a reckless endangerment charge from the Imperial
prosecutor.  How big is your bank employer, and how good a lawyer can it
afford?

Counter-measures occur at different levels.  The first is not being
found by the bank -- so take that ship somewhere far away, even outside
of Imperial space.  Another approach is to change the ship\'s papers and
the transponder.  The latter is rather a problem; it seems to me that
it\'s a little harder than changing your car\'s VIN.  The second level of
countermeasures comes in when the first have failed; then you fall back
on your anti-hijack procedures.  These of course should be changed after
you get into default, because the bank may know what your original
procedures were, especially the nature of the ship\'s computer\'s
anti-hijack program.

"No, no, we sent a check by x-boat!  We\'re not in default anymore! 
Here\'s a copy of the check!  And if you don\'t accept that and put your
guns away, I\'m going to have you charged with piracy and hijacking when
we jump out at Lanth."  It\'s a problem, isn\'t it?

It depends, but that could well be part of your financing agreement.

> Is repossession one of the penalties for violation of such stipulations? 

Probably not.  As a lawyer working in the corporate sector, I have some
idea how large purchase and loan contracts are drafted.  Certain issues
have to be covered under just about any legal system:  price; terms of
payment (amount, time, place; nature of payment (i.e., cash, kind,
etc.)); security arrangements; third-party financing; insurance (really
part of security); remedies for non-performance; and a few things that
I\'m forgetting because it\'s late or intentionally leaving out because
they\'re irrelevant to this discussion.  

Non-performance may have several levels, the most serious being
default.  Default would trigger the right to repossess.  Leaving the
subsector might be a default; might not.

We do talk about this from time to time on the list.  I\'ll let the

Substance	melting point	boiling point
Hydrogen	-259		-252
Nitrogen	-210		-196
Oxygen		-219		-183 
(values are in degrees Celsius at one atmosphere ambient pressure).

Contemporary storage systems for LH2 range in pressurisation from 2.5 to
1000 atmospheres (space shuttle LH2 tanks at the low end to a high
density system for an experimental hydrogen propelled truck).
	Most commercially available tanks for LH2 are pressurised to 11
atmospheres, LOX/LN2 around 7-8. Typically a gas/liquid mixture is
stored (the temp inside a LOX tank is -160 C) to keep the mass of the
tank down (less insulation).

Another Ob Trav :-
The implication from MT descriptions of portable life support systems
for space suits is that ultracompressed gas tankage is routine
(superdense oxygen tanks at TL 12 and bonded superdense tanks at TL
14?). Either that or liquid oxygen is stored and bled into the system to
replenish spent gas (and remove excess water vapour, CO2, and heat).
Pretty nifty tech, in any case.

Fair enough (though the nitpicking is sort of useful, even if it\'s an
education in e-debating - if there is such a thing). Perhaps FAQs should
be compiled on various topics to prevent repetition on a lot of gearhead
points.

To historians, it is an urban MYTH, not an urban LEGEND, because of the
lack of a kernel of truth...

Myth is untrue
Legend is beased upon truth, but may be blown out of proportion.

Its URBAN because of the dissemination methods.

Bill Gates greed is an urban legend

Bill gates homosexuality is an urban myth, apparently... there is no
eveidence it is true...

Considering the newest launch site to be added to NASA\'s roster is only a
few hundred miles from Anchorage, which is at ~61 N, maybe not. However,
for equitorial orbits, equitorial launch has, I\'ve read, two advantages:
1) Higher initial rotational velocity if launching in direction of rotation.
2) less fuel needed for narrowing the orbit to equitorial.

Polar orbits are better lauched away from the equator, for the lower
initial rotational velocity, from what I\'ve read.

IMTU, main starports tend to be on or near equators where habitability
exists, but secondary ports (see also Invasion Earth) are more likelyto be
non-equitorial. According to IE, Eath has AECO in NW africa, and Phoenix
(arizona). IMTU, there is also Scout Base Kodiak, on Kodiak Island.

Salt water is unlikely to be effective: BD is environmentally sealed. Based
upon TD, + or - 2-5 atm...

How about this one: straw over traditional Bear traps, sized up a bit.
Won\'t hurt the troopie, but may slow him down. BTB, some of the traps that
HAVE been used have openings over 1.5 feet, 150 lbs bite force, and chains
and structure capable of over a ton of pull.... works like mines, but gives
you time to shoot them with glue, etc.

Another idea: Roll a stack of trees at them.

Well , the iterview with the cast members on MTV was a big tip off...
Look, i don\'t believe that Michael Douglas was ever President, but that
doesn\'t stop me from thinking _The American President_ is one of my
favorite movies.

_TBWP_ has a wonderfully realistic style, I\'ll accept it as that, and

that the "statute of limitations" has finally run out on the War of the

hysteria.

Or perhaps, with shows like JERRY SPRINGER, COPS, pro wrestling, and the

There is some MacOS Traveller software at http://www.bits.org.uk/ - follow
the links on the products page. The demo versions are fully operational but
have no save/print.

Additionally, some more of Rob Prior\'s MacOS Traveller material is at my
site http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/ - mainly hypercard stacks.

Rob was planning to complete Metator the detailed planet design system he
previewed in late 97 this summer, IIRC. He was planning to add in the First
In design sequence.

I play T4 with Marc\'s T5 draft material, plus High Guard for Starships.

I\'m starting to move towards GT but I find GURPS slightly clunky compared
to T4 or MT. My main interest in it is because I have to run it at cons
late this year and newer BITS material is likely to need GT support.

The published GT material is generally of very high standard - Far Trader
is one of the best Traveller books, period.

        _The Traveller Book_, Starship Combat section.  While I do not have

prior to combat to avoid explosive decompression effects from battle damage.
Further, it says it takes one turn to do so.

Second question, given a urban battle field setting what measures could a

to drop buildings on them.  How about high pressure hoses of salt water

short their circuitry?  What about figuring a way to drop them into a hole
and then filling the hole with cement?  How about spraying them with some
kind of quick setting super epoxy that would render them immobile?  Those
are the only ideas I have and and I admit some are a bit off the wall.
Anyone have any other thoughts?       

Most of those are either easy to spot, only work close in or require
too much vulnerable infrastructure.

At twentieth century tech, I\'d go for an anti tank gun.

Even just a 40mm AA/AT gun. Your armour might not be penetrated
but your Marine is going to be lying on his back.

At close ranges, think of anything used anti-tank.
Not those concrete bollards or anti-tank ditches though.
Sticky bombs come to mind.

Your main problem is to stop them using their tech to attack from outside
your range.

So dress up in civilian clothes, use grenades, bombs and battleaxes.

Oh, and expect to die a lot.

        Well, unfortunately its canon as a capability even for Free Traders.
        Keep in mind, we\'re talking about a culture that has figured out how
to get around the limit of the speed of light, store cyro-cooled hydrogen,
build a fusion reactor small enough to power a car without safety issues and
manipulate the strong and weak nuclear forces and the force of gravity.
        Fluid dynamics ought to be a *cake walk*.
        The same thing with my soap-bubble airlock...  folks were commenting
about being worried about the electrical discharge from the
static-electrical charge used to maintain the bubble.  Well, we currently
routinely transfer people from helicopters in flight to steel decks of ships
everyday...  helo\'s are wonderful Van De Graff generators.  We have
phenomenally few problems, regardless of the plot of _Hunt for Red October_.
By TL 10, safely discharging the hull of a starship after it is through the
bubble-lock ought to be child\'s play.
        Worse, (he said pointing canon around indescriminately)
fighter-craft carriers and x-boat tenders exist.  The carriers have launch
tubes capable of putting a 50-ton Rampart into space every 30 seconds...
you aren\'t doing that with hatch doors and decompression of spaces.  The
tenders, I believe, can bring an X-boat on board for maint....  if it was a
dumb idea, x-boat tenders would be a spar with engines at one end, docking
collars at intervals and the bridge at the other.  That\'s not what they look
like (ask Jesse ;).
        For every 10dktons, you get a set of "doors" on your vessel or
station capable of allowing one vessel to launch per turn.  Fifteen minutes
to launch a starship.... presuming that the crew is ready to go at T:0, the
only thing that might take 15mins is decompressing the launch bay.  If it
takes 14 mins for the crew to do PFC\'s, then the only way to get out in one
minute is a bubble-lock...  whatever you want for YTU.
        Just some things to think about.

<wailing louder, gnashing teeth with more force>

I don\'t want to do this. I\'m tired and as a result cranky. This is going to
take up considerable bandwidth. I\'m going to sound like an arrogant know it
all.

Before we go on, I know that there\'s a difference between the term myth and
the term legend, with or without the prefix urban. If you simply corrected
me on that point everything would be just fine. I admit, I incorrectly used
the terms synonymously because it\'s much easier than defining "myth"
correctly and "legend" correctly and it didn\'t seem appropriate.

However, you emphasized the terms by capitalizing them, and then proceeded
to define them imprecisely and incorrectly. That irks me quite a bit.

>Myth is untrue


From the Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and
Legend (ISBN: 0-06-250511-4):

myth - "A story, presented as having actually occurred in a previous age,
explaining the cosmological and supernatural traits of a people, their gods,
heroes, cultural traits, religious beliefs, etc."

It goes on to further clarify the definition over the course of a page or
so. It has nothing to do with truth or fiction, even though myths are not
generally accepted as truth. To paraphrase George Laurence Gomme: myths are
the science of pre-scientific cultures.

It\'s not whether they\'re true or false, but the motifs, the themes and the
characters.

>Legend is beased upon truth, but may be blown out of proportion.


Nope. A legend is not always based on truth. Not by a long shot. From the
same source as the above definition:

legend - <I\'ll skip the bit about the religious origins of the word legend>
"Legend has since come to be used for a narrative supposedly based on fact,
with an inter-mixture of traditional materials, told about a person, place
or incident."

The entry goes on to explain the blurry distinction between myths and
legends. Legends are distinct from myths, some of them are based on
historical fact, but they don\'t have to have even a kernel of truth. It\'s
not the truth or lack thereof that defines a legend, it\'s the type of
narrative it is.

The distinction is blurry and sometimes the classification of a specific
narrative is hotly debated. There are examples of both myth and legend in
the stories of Hercules and King Arthur.

To further confuse everybody, there are also what folklorists call local
legends. These are narratives that are attached to a specific place, often
explaining how the place came to be, or how the place got its name. Some of
these are sort of like little mini-myths, as they may include gods, mythic
heroes and other attributes of myths.

There\'s a broad type as well, the folktale, which is vague and refers to
just about anything that\'s orally transmitted. It\'s been specifically kept
all-inclusive to serve as a convenient form of shorthand. If I said, "I
collected 200 folktales in one week in Philadelphia\'s Fishtown," it means
that I collected 200 jokes, stories, legends, and other "straight"
narratives.

>Its URBAN because of the dissemination methods.


Nope. The vast majority of urban legends are transmitted orally, which is
the same vector that\'s been used for as long as there\'s been spoken
language. The distinction of "urban" is kind of false. It has more to do
with the internal workings of the folklore community than anything else.

Granted, some are now transmitted via fax, some are transmitted via email,
but both of these are relatively recent developments that combine the
convenience of more or less instant communication with the written word. A
number folklorists have broadened the concept of oral tradition to include
fax and email, since sending a folktale along is as simple as forwarding it
or running it through the fax. Other methods of instant duplication, such as
mimeograph machines and photocopiers are often included to some extent as
well. Not all of the folklore that is transmitted by these technological
surrogates are considered folktales.

Modern day legends are called urban legends because they exist despite the
proliferation of newspapers, radio and television in the industrialized
world. At the time when the study of the more modern folktales started in
America, it was something of a "revolution" in the field. Very few academics
deemed it worthwhile to study modern legends such as the hookman, babysitter
legends and the like.

It was much more acceptable to study rural American folktales. Urban and
suburban types were sort of thought to be "above" the transmission of
folktales. So a term was invented to segregate the study of urban legends
from the more traditional earthy rural legends that were much more
fashionable. Traditional folklorists kind of thought of these legends as
being little more than rumors, of no importance to the folklore community.
It wasn\'t as direct and snobbish as it sounds, really. It was just the
general attitude of the time.

The term was popularized by the author Jan Harold Brunvand, who is now seen
as the "patron saint" of the study of urban legends. He started with "The
Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings" (ISBN
0-393-95169-3), which is something of a dry scholarly work. Through his
newspaper column, he discovered that people were really quite interested in
whether or not the story they heard about the spider eggs in the Bubble Yum
was true, or if Mikey really *did* die from mixing Pop-Rocks and Coca-Cola.

He also found out that a couple of urban legends actually were true, despite
the fact that they fit neatly into the big book of folklore motifs. As his
books progressed they became less and less academic, and they began to focus
more on the new stories that fans sent in and his attempts to track down the
truth behind them.

The internet, bulletin boards and the various computer networks offered him
a venue to find facts about the origins of the legends that he could use to
track them down. He became more interested in computer folklore after being
exposed to it, since it was so similar to mimeographed and photocopied
"xerox lore," and since so many traditional urban legends were being adapted
for transmission via email. His interest took on a life of its own and led
to the boom in popularity of tracking urban legends on the internet.

>Bill Gates greed is an urban legend


Only in a very indirect sense. His vast wealth and Microsoft\'s ruthless and
questionable business practices and don\'t need to circulate orally. For
example,

>Bill gates homosexuality is an urban myth, apparently... there is no
>eveidence it is true...


It\'s not a myth according to any definition I\'ve ever seen, and even if it
was it wouldn\'t be because there\'s no evidence as to whether or not it\'s
true.

Okay. I\'ve had enough. If anybody would really like to discuss the
definitions of the terms myth and legend at greater length I\'d be glad to do
so in private email. I\'ve already taken up enough bandwidth on the list.

Up until very recently, my group played Marc\'s T5 rules. However, progress in
those rules has been so slow that I\'m switching my group back to MT rules. I own
two sets of CT rules, MT, and the T5 stuff. Of these, MT is the best set of
integrated rules, IMO.

  I\'ve argued that capability at least in warships, but it doesn\'t follow
it\'s cheap or that a ship can do so for the docking bay that contains it.
</Steve Hudson>

My argument wasn\'t that it was cheap, but that despite the expense the
capability is (canonically) installed on all starships to make them combat
worthy. This being the case, venting and refilling bays shouldn\'t be a
problem.  

Frankie wondered whether one might vent the atmosphere and regenerate it
instead of storing and releasing.  This is a possibility, but the argument
still holds: If you can vent and regenerate the ship\'s entire atmosphere
then doing so for an enclosed bay should be no trouble.

I agree with Micheal V. that we often under-estimate the technological
capabilities of the Imperium.  I\'m sure Leonardo Da Vinchi had a engineer
buddy who kept pestering him about technicalities with his flying machine 
idea: 

"It\'ll *never* work.  Do you *know* what kind of loads you\'ll be
creating?"

"Maybe someone will come up with stronger materials"

"But you have to be realistic!  Our best metals come *nowhere near* having
enough strength or lightness!  Even with improvements in smithing
technology, steel will always be too heavy!" 

"Maybe someone will come up with a different material."

"Impossible, we\'ve discovered all the basic substances there are.  Woods
are *way* too weak, metals are *way* too heavy."

"There could be light metals we haven\'t found yet."

"Light metals?  It goes against *everything* we know of physics!"

The point is that alot of the nitpicks people come up with on this list to
say that ideas are impossible/improbable/implausible are engineering
problems disguised as physical limitations by our present ignorance of
future physics.  And some are mere engineering problems.

The line between reality and entertainment has another recent example along
the lines of War of the Worlds.  Anyone in the US catch that TV special
maybe six months ago or more that was touted as real videotape of the events
leading up to a disappearence ala TBWP?  Nowhere in the TV adverts leading
up to it did it EVER mention that it was a teleplay.  As it progressed, I
was thinking "Bullshit.  There\'s no way >>insert an event<< could happen
like that with someone camcorder\'ing away".  The final kicker was when the
alien probe flew through the front door and zipped down the hall.  TOTAL,
and I mean TOTAL, Hollywood lens flare with lens reflections and everything.
Exactly like the flares in Lightwave.  Real cameras tend not to do that
these days.  A camcorder will wash out and ghost before it shows a Hollywood
flare like that.  So anyway, when the special ends (and STILL nowhere during
the presentation did they mention it was a teleplay, it was still hyped as
real) the credits roll and low-and-behold you get a full list of actors,
including "Grey alien #1" etc.  I just KNOW that there were people who
didn\'t pick up on the production clues during the show, and they were
probably too busy firing up their computers to hit the internet and proclaim
proof of ET life existed, to notice the credits roll.

That is where your infantile mind tricks are flawed - our crash eugenics
programmes instigated when we were annexed by the Vilani in 588 has been
breeding a natural immunity to your mindpowers which has concealed our
master plan from you! Soon, using the spur of Terra to encourage our

of game designers is rewriting Invasion: Earth to allow us to win. This,
coupled with the fall of the Imperium to Tech Level 12 since it was GURPSed
leads us to believe that we have a six to twelve month window of
opportunity to exploit our TL14 advantage before SJG publish anything on

I think that a careful explanation is in order here.  Was the entire race
uplifted?  Are just the clones considered Children?  Does the term Ancients
apply only to the single race, or are there others mixed in so that it is
the "time period" that is considered when applying the term?

I\'m still suspicious of the idea that Grandfather was a freak or a mule, to
use Asimov\'s term.  Seems more plausible that he was a seed casts by another
race or entity.  Of course, I will admit that I have visions of Puppeteers
dancing in my head.  Is his "origin" cast in concrete or open to discussion?

Hence NASA\'s newest launch site... the pole, is actually the ideal polar
orbit launch site, but there are obvious drawbacks to that exact site.

Equatorial launch sites are the lowest energy, hence highest payload,
sites to launch to geosynchronous orbits and equatorial orbits. You have
the highest rotational velocity to add to the launch speed, and every
erg counts when there\'s a 3 billon dollar comms satellite yoiu\'re
putting up.

That\'s why ArianeSpace\'s launch site is where it is, and why several
African nations, if they ever get their political and infrastructure
houses in order could become quite wealthy from being launch sites.

I\'ve run such "repo man" scenarios--typically, they operate either as
freelancers (with their own ship) or as representatives of a megacorp that
finances ships (with a company ship.) The ships used for such purposes are
typically known as "houndships" IMTU. Houndships are typically small (100
tons), fast (3 or 4 G, Jump-2 to 4) and well-armed (triple laser turret)
in order to efficiently pursue their quarry, with EM masking and a good
computer/communications array. They feature a few extra double-occupancy
staterooms for boarding troops.
	Typically, repo-ing ships is a nonviolent exercise, depending more
on detective work (checking port records and logged flight plans, staking
out likely destinations) and stealth & guile (sneaking on board the craft
to be repo\'d while the crew is away or at minimum strength.) Taking the
craft back is of primary importance, punishing the delinquent owner is
secondary. An intact ship whose crew "got away" is far preferable to a
ship that takes severe damage due to the repo/capture operation.
	Armed houndships typically only engage unarmed or lightly-armed
craft: the idea is to stop an unarmed ship with the threat of violence
rather than engaging in a pitched battle. Houndships are not designed as
line combat craft, and couldn\'t stand in battle against a craft outfitted
as a pirate/assault ship, but can do fine against a lightly armed seeker
or free trader.
	In many ways operations are similar to pirate/privateer
operations, but with more concern for the condition of the ship.
	Type A and B starports maintain a shipping registry which lists
all ships in the subsector posted delinquent by a financial institution,
their last known location, and ship description, along with other
information.
	Anti-repo procedures are fairly similar to full-time anti-hijack
procedures: extensive use of identity verification and password-protected
access to starship functions, running anti-hijack programs in likely repo
situations. Modifications to the ship\'s transponder and forged registry
papers are difficult, but can create a new "identity" for the craft. The
most common strategy, though, is skipping the subsector and heading for
non-Imperial space; in many cases, a permanent move by necessity. Since
megacorps aren\'t necessarily limited by Imperial boundaries, a houndship
crew might operate outside of Imperial space specifically to pursue
delinquent ships--but will need to return periodically to update its ship
listings.
	There is an article in an old JTAS on this subject: _Giving the
Bank a Fighting Chance_ by Jolly Blackburn (who now does the _KNIGHTS OF
THE DINNER TABLE_ comic) in JTAS # 16. I have used some information from
that article for this response.

Strategies would be fairly similar to anti-tank tactics used by defenders
without armor, and will doubtless be defensive rather than offensive in
nature, since most (like the examples above) are based on prepared traps,
defenses, and positions. 

High-pressure hoses wouldn\'t do much: battledress suits are well-insulated
and would not "short out" so easily. Cement and epoxy are possible but
kind of off-the-wall: cement doesn\'t harden instantly, and a
muscle-amplified suit might break a quick-setting epoxy (you\'d gum up its
sensors and equipment, though...)

The basic strategy would be to lure battledress troops into an enclosed
area, where their superior mobility is lessened and their long-range
weapons less useful, and then blow something up at them. Battledress is
tough (assuming the existence of Marine commando uber-battledress in your
Traveller universe) but a lot of weapons will punch through it, including
TL7/8 tank guns and anti-tank missiles. Remotely operated and concealed
ATGM/ATG sites, capable of providing supporting fire for each other (so
ATGM stand A can attack while the battledress troops are coating ATGM
stand B with high-energy plasma) can make life rough for battledress
troops, and enough of this kind of harassment can degrade their strength a
great deal.

Figuring out some way to distract, harass or otherwise make life rough for
the battledress troopers (smoke, firebombs to harass, distract and screw
up IR/thermal-imaging, launching paint or glue or groat poop to gum up
battledres systems) will slow them down and make life easier for your
camouflaged but probably unarmored ATGM crews. Battledress troops have
tremendous shock effect due to their mobility, but if you can limit or
deny their mobility they become less effetive--and they make lousy
stationary gun emplacements. A couple dozen ATGM\'s (or many
gun/artillery/MRL rounds) is cheaper than one battledress-equipped
soldier, and thus it makes sense to dump all the fire you can on an
exposed battledress trooper.

Another assumption is that it is possible to detect the field generated by
grav vehicles, and create grav-sensitive "Bouncing Betty" style mines
(proximity fused) which make battledress troops in flight packs want to
walk on the ground, where contact mines, ATGM\'s and ATG\'s, and other
lower-tech weapons can track them.  Or you can just drop a building on
them...

I\'ve used the idea that he realized that a "natural"

Doesn\'t matter. The *prefix* "nano-: is *defined* as "1e-9". That is,

The situation with LH2 is *quite* different. It\'s handled as a
*liquid*. The pressures involved are modest, except for the high speed
pumps used to feed LH2 to the J-drive. The only "pressure" in the tanks
will be from the *weight* of the LH2. They\'ll probably have a from a
few psi to 1 atm of gas pressure above the surface of the liquid. 

The temperatures are mostly a matter of insulating things so the LH2
*stays* cold. *Producing* LH2 requires getting rid of large amounts of
heat, but that\'s (hopefully) something the radiators can handle.
*Using* LH2 isn\'t a problem, because the places it\'s used (fusion
reactors, and drives) are *producing* lots of energy, and thus
"pre-heating" the gas is easy.

And check out just how *much* power a typical ship generates. More than

Two problems. First, once you get small cheap fusion plants, there\'s no
*point* to a monopoly. The "fewer, larger" setup actually *costs*
money. That is, it\'s more expensive to operate. Sure, there are
economies of scale. But transmission losses go *up* with scale, not
down.

Add in the fact that most *vehicle* powerplants are perfectly capable
of being used to generate power. After all, that fusion unit in your
air-raft doesn\'t care if the *electric* power it is putting out goes to
run the CG and thrusters, or to run your lights & heat. 

It\'s a losing situation for the megacorp. They *could* do it. But it\'d
require placing *obvious* and *obnoxious* restrictions on the
population. And without really being worth it profit wise.

Again, remember that *vehicles* are "fusion/electric". And that
portable generators would be part of the equipment for a colony ship.

And then you get into the joys of "allocations". Such as the fact that
in some cases they are calculated *very* oddly. Such that in an
*average* year the allocations of the Colorado add up to *more* than
100% of the river\'s flow!

Point of fact: Many (most?) years the Colorado ceases to *exist* except

Last I heard, China *still* had plans for such a diversion *including*
nuclear demolitions. I forget which river it was and which mountain

Next project on the way for GURPS Traveller is Starports. Steve thinks it
would be cool beyond measure if we could have a sample starport map for
each class and not just a generic Class I-V, but a diagram of Flammarion
Downport (Class V) and so on.

I don\'t remember any actual canon starport layouts (I don\'t rmember if I
did one for Champa Starport when I wrote the JTAS article, and I don\'t have
access to my references right now.

Are there canon layouts for any specific starports? If not, I need
volunteers to design them. They need to be based on reality as much as
possible, which means they have to be laid out in a rational fashion, and
should be based as closely as possible on real-world airports (putting
aside for the moment whether they should be based on seaports or neither
one).

I need volunteers to design these diagrams. Please contact me at
LKW@IO.COM, I still cannot read TMLs (never have tracked down what the
problem is).

That is _only_ for it\'s use as a prefix to SIE units. There\'s more to
the English language than the CRC ;-)

The Greek derivation  as \'midget\' is still a perfectly valid use of the
word. 
Despite what many scientists and engineers seem to think, their jargon
is _not_ necessarily the last word in the english language...

All our _micro_computers are quite a bit bigger than 10^-6th...as is a
microscope, or a micrometer, all perfectly valid words from the same
root.

From the Guru of Traveller 3d art this... Well. I just don\'t know what
to say! Thank you.

Lighting is an area I haven\'t explored in RDS yet. Mainly I\'ve used the
"stock" lighing that comes with the scene wizard function. I guess I\'ll
tackle that after finishing the scout. I am working on a \'burn layer\'
now as well as the antenna.

I\'ve wondered on this myself.

Is Grandfather hiding from an even more powerful force ala "Heechee"?
Is Grandfather really the Ancient one or is he a pretender to the throne, or
possibly someone left by the real Grandfather to keep tabs on us and his
experiments, until we are ready, or until we show signs of getting too
advanced/aggressive?

Did he construct his pocket universe with customized natural laws and
constants.  A slightly different gravitational constant?  Different
strong/weak forces?  Does time pass differently in his universe allowing him
more time to analyze and react to things in ours, or to allow him to view
changes in out universe at an accelerated rate?

I keep coming up with more questions than answers, but it is a fun process.

Yes. Though this depends *strongly* on both the length of the planet\'s
day, and on the size (diameter) of the planet.

Basicly, on Earth\'s equator you are travelling almost 1000 miles/hour
faster than at the poles. And that\'s *not* a velocity to be ignored
lightly. 

> Would this still apply in a grav-oriented society?

It might not be as important, but it\'d still be a factor. 

Hmmm. 1000 mph = 1467 fps = 447 m/s. 

So it\'d save about 200 kiloJoules per kilogram of cargo.

Depends on what sort of energy/fuel costs they have.

Just remember that "equatorial" *doesn\'t* necessarily mean "low
variation". Consider a planet like H. Beam Piper\'s Uller. Near 90
degree axial tilt. The seasons vary like crazy *everywhere*.
